      Welcome to Monketo Talk, a place for Monketo and his peeps (Bunny, Chicken, and maybe some other animals) to stop in and chat.  Since  urlLink Chicken  and  urlLink I  have harassed the living bejeebers out of Monketo for not sharing our blog obsession, it was time we put up or shut up.   Welcome to the blogosphere, my good man!

      No Pappadeaux tonight.  Both Vicente and the fabulous Dianne ran late, my throat still hurts, and I really didn't feel like putting on any makeup.  I did order V's cute Valentine's Day gifts (plus something for myself).  Then my Valentine's babe and I decided we'd celebrate our bdays in between Feb 14 and Mar 6 (told ya I'd remind you again) at a restaurant neither of us has been to, take a long afternoon,  go shopping and buy ourselves presents.  I was going to buy her a French Kitty purse like mine but thought this would be more fun.  (Lisa, I have to warn you - I bought the purse at the same place I bought those Burberry sunglasses, but don't let that put you off.)  Vicente is the nicest tonight.  He brought me several new fish, a loach (freaky little thing) and a crab.  Digby the angelfish is upset.  Hank has found a new school.  And the crab (Captain Pervy) is a little slow in learning the tank.  Very exciting Saturday night at the coop.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      (I swear, this is the last post...for this afternoon)  I just consumed 20 french fries.  I know because I counted them.  And although that fits in with my new switch to being a vegetarian (they were fried in canola oil, ok?), I don't want a new switch to being fat.  It is difficult to find things to eat that I like and that didn't walk at one time.  I'll eat fish, but then I feel guilty when I feed my fish at home.  Vitamins make me sick, eggs are only tolerable when I'm in the mood.  How the hell do I get some protein?  I bruise FAR too easily.  Here is a run-down of what I eat (and this is really oh-so-sad):  Taco Cabana bean and cheese tacos...that damned flour tortilla is probably hanging on my thighs as we speak  Salad...only if it's really good, like one from Eatzi's or something (or a pasta salad, damn the carbs again!)  Vegetables...sometimes, I feel like I'm being too well-behaved and then eat three Ding Dongs to compensate  Tony's Deep Dish Cheese Pizza for One - or Fruschetta's Four Cheese Self-Rising Pizza...I should slap a couple on my belly for good measure, just in case the fat doesn't stick there the first time  Sugar Free Red Bull...well, honestly, if I could survive on this, bean & cheese tacos from the Cabana and frozen cheese pizza, I'd have no complaints  Isn't there some kind of  pill  or something I can take?

      I decided what I want for my birthday (which, by the way, is in March, March 6th, and you know I'll keep reminding you, I have no shame...obviously):  1) a boob job (V, are you listening closely here?)  2) a cure for world hunger, aids and cancer  3) a chance to meet Scott Weiland  Since I doubt I will receive any of the above, some bath products or candles would be nice.

      Vicente and I went to meet B at a gay bar.  I was one of three women there (bartender, one couple).  Suddenly, B's best friend, D, decides he loves me.  And proceeds to tell everyone over and over until B had to say, "Get off of her already."  I had a blast.  Even if D was drunk off his ass and B flirted with my boyfriend.  It was a good night.  I fell asleep on the couch listening to CDs and Vicente took the babies to bed.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      The coop had not been cleaned since before budgets (don't be alarmed, our company always waits until the last minute, so it's only been a few weeks).  My mother kept making little remarks like, "You should let me come up and show you how to  really  clean a house," so, I took her up on it.  Of course, my father was in a foul mood and I had to pretty much run him off.  For those of you who wonder why I used to be (and am still sometimes) so hard on myself, spend five minutes with my dad.  Whatever you are doing, you aren't doing it the correct way.  According to him.  Anyway, my mom had to leave because of company, I took a break, colored my hair (not disastrous results, just not BLONDE enough yet), window shopped for a new haircut, listened to my latest mix, had a couple glasses of wine, and I think it is time for a nap.  (If Vicente were here, it'd be a nasty nap, but no such luck.)  Here is my question for the week:  If you regularly smoke one pack a day, but three per day on the weekends, does that make you a 1.75 pack per day smoker?

      Vicente just called.  He's insistent upon eating out tonight (keep the smart remarks to yourself).  At Tachito's (well, first it was Pappadeaux, but that's supposed to be tomorrow night).  I've had Mexican food for bfast and for lunch.  And I'm not all that hungry.  What about my French-Kitty t-shirts?  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Ran errands at lunch.  I hate doing that but I felt a little lost without my cell phone, so I ran home and then suddenly had 50,000 other things to do.  In one hour.  Fuck it, I just bought the stamps for work and a Sugar Free Red Bull.  And several packs of MULs.  Still cannot decide whether or not I am hungry.  It's probably the sinus medication and the fact that I've heard "My Sharona" about 15 times already today.  Should call for food...I need sustenance for tonight...cleaning and shit.  I hate housework.  Damn.  Okay, so maybe I  am  a little more cranky...  Here's my Friday afternoon dilemma:  How on earth to scoot from the hood all the way out to Deep Ellum, then back to the Ville with French-Kitty t-shirt(s) and four bottles of wine (not ALL for tonight, please!...there's really nothing left to bruise anyway).  Any help with logistics would be most appreciated.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I'm listening to 311 and even that's not helping me.  I don't want to be here, I feel awful, I'm cranky and still going on no sleep.  I lost my cell phone, I'm wearing so awful an outfit you can't even call it an outfit.  My boss is not happy with me because I was out yesterday.  She hasn't said that, but after almost three years, I can tell.  I have no Sugar Free Red Bulls to drink to wake up.  My throat still hurts.  I have to clean my house tomorrow in time for the Super Bowl party we're having and will have to pull teeth to get Paddy Mac to help (maybe he will read this and feel guilty or at least obligated, I'm hoping).  I'm covered in bruises because Paddy and my friends decided it would be the  most  fun to drag my drunk ass around the house, banging my head and back (and arms and legs) on the floor in the process.  My oven door is broken (don't ask).  I want to go home.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      First it was Crime Library on Court TV's website.  Then it was Netflix (and I had to downgrade, I just couldn't keep up with five movies at a time).  Then it was The Sims.  Then expanding The Sims.  Then burning CDs for my friends.  Then bean and cheese tacos, extra cheese, two salsas a piece from the Cabana. Then it was writing here.  I won't even tell you what I've become hooked on next.  Okay, I will share her with you, but only if you  promise  not to stop reading MY blog.  Look over to your right, that link called "Belle de Jour" - I couldn't stop reading this until I had read four months of posts.  I am at once both impressed by and envious of her writing ability.  And I am obviously not alone in this opinion, since she won "Best Writing" in the Guardian Competition for 2003.  I urge you to at least check it out, even if you have something against prostitution (I don't, when it's legal and governed...in fact, I think it should be legalized, but that's another post entirely).  I'm off to bed or to crawl in the tub or something.  The sinus thing developed into a raging, screaming migraine, so my day has been shit.  Except for the discovery of Belle de Jour, which I could only start reading when I got out of bed at 7:30 tonight...  Oh hell, maybe I will play The Sims for a while while I'm waiting for Vicente to let me know how it all went tonight.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I'm not speaking of the mental variety (we all know I'm insane).  My sinuses are sooooo messed up today that I feel like I don't have a head.  I do not know how people are sick when they have children, because the babies are really driving me crazier and I just want to lie in bed and feel sorry for myself.  At least they aren't barking.

      I was standing outside our office this morning, smoking in the cold.  Our office is located on one of our properties and the charity organization that delivers meals to the elderly in our community was here, with two men unloading their car.  An older gentleman walked by and said, "Beautiful day!"  I had to agree.  The weather is stunning - still a little chilly but not freezing.  I was still smoking when he walked back out.  He said, "I'll give you ten dollars if you give me that cigarette right now and never smoke again."  I gave him the cigarette and he put it out.  Then he told me it was bad for me and my children (?) and that I should stop right now.  Then he handed me two fives.  I told the man I could not take his money when I knew I couldn't promise him I wouldn't ever smoke again.  I tried to give it back to him.  He simply said, "Yes, you can.  Have an inexpensive lunch on me and let that cigarette there (he tapped the dead ciggie with his foot) remind you never to smoke again."  Ten bucks could buy me three packs of cigarettes...

Kind of like those guys in bars who never seem to get a hint that you really just are there to have a drink and not there to be blown away by their charm.  It let me delete something else I was rambling on about last night.  But not the test post I did just to see if my changes to my profile were saved.  They were...I deleted the damn post but then I Crtl/Refresh this morning and there it is again.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Why on earth is it that we feel the need to start calling people when we are drunk?  Why do we think they want to hear from us?  (Actually,  I  do like to hear from drunk people, but I always think I'm irritating the people I call...which I probably am...anyway, I'm digressing.)  Why do we also feel the need to tell everyone we see and/or talk to that we "are so drunk?"  It's not like the other person cannot tell we are totally polluted.  We think they can't tell we're weaving, or that our words are slurring, or that we are talking really loudly.  Why do we feel the need, when we are drunk, to make out with total strangers or ex-boyfriends or co-workers at a Christmas party?  I have the tendency to be rather amorous while drinking.  I guess people feel alcohol makes them sexier to other people.  (Side Note To D:  Your phone call inspired this, but you are not in the least bit: obnoxious, loud, weaving (well, I couldn't tell over the phone, I'm guessing), or making out with me, unfortunately!  You just made me start writing this post...so don't take offense.)  Why do  I  feel the need to have someone else regulate my alcoholic intake when I get past three drinks?  (Notice that I switched pronouns, as I don't know anyone else who does this, but I'm sure you are out there.)  Like any one of my friends is going to risk having Psycho Chicken come running after them by cutting off my supply?  But yet, there it always is, every time:  "Please, please, just tell me when I start getting obnoxiously drunk..."  I had a conversation with my mother tonight on the way to and from (and to and from again) Tom Thumb for groceries, and I'll get to that in a minute.  While shopping at Tom Thumb, no one was at the cigarette counter, I blanked and totally forgot my town was now wet, and I left without the very staples I went in the grocery store for:  alcohol and nicotine.  My mother asks me the rhetorical question, "Are you going to make me go back?"  I just shot her a look.  So there I am, BACK at Tom Thumb 10 minutes after I left the first time, buying three bottles of really cheap sparkling wine (vodka has been getting me too tipsy lately).  I go through the same checkout line.  I have the same cashier.  Zachary (cashier boy) does a double-take.  I'm very flippant when I tell him, "I left without the most important thing."  And there was still no one manning the cigarette counter.  My whole point, and this I made to my mother, is:  We are all going to die.  Like my friend Lisa (who tans) says, "If I'm going, at least I'll be beautiful when I do leave."  So to all of you nay-sayers, I have this to say:  Let me smoke, let me drink, let me act like an adolescent, let me be obsessed by clothes and makeup and shoes and basically act like I'm stuck at 14.  When we die, look who goes out with a bang and a smile on her face!  (And lung cancer and no liver, most likely.  What the hell.)  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      So what if I do put STP on just about every CD I make?  I like Scottie's voice.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with his ass (contrary to what Vicente believes).  But it does help.  Men are the same way.  Do you really think anyone would listen to Britney Spears if she wasn't as hot as she is?  A couple of my loyal, devoted readers (all five of you) have commented on the abundance of the use of the F word in here.  And you sounded  surprised .  Okay, so fair enough, you all said you were laughing at this (which was basically my goal) and that you thoroughly enjoyed the posts.  Just  had  to bring up the F word, though, didn't you?  Actually, none of you did.  I'm only saying (writing) what my mother would ("Carol, do you really have to be so vulgar?").  When I started this post, I wasn't thinking about STP, except that I'm re-burning a CD and I know that even though Vicente will enjoy his copy, he'll make some smart-ass remark about Scottie.  What I was thinking was that I would write a post where all I write is the F word.  Over and over.  And over.  Because I can.  However, that doesn't really make an impact, does it?  In fact, I think it makes much more of an impact that I am purposely NOT writing the F word, but instead I'm writing "the F word."  Does that make sense?  Remember the first time you cussed in front of your parents?  I was nine years old, bored, and trying to get my father's attention.  I think he was watching "Hee Haw" or some such shit, and I decided what a fabulous idea it would be to march back and forth through the living room, directly in between my father and the television, and say, "Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn" over and over until he noticed.  Well, he noticed.  I didn't cuss again for five years (a week without TV is a  lifetime  to a child).  What is wrong with saying the F word every now and then?  When I use it, I don't mean "fornication" or some other sin I've been brainwashed to believe will send me hurtling through all nine circles of hell to burn forever.  Sex is a natural act.  All that aside, though...I just like the way the F word sounds.  It's like Damn or Shit or Hell.  In fact, my father had two unusual sayings:  "It's a hell of a note..." He would say this right before launching into the reason(s) I was pissing him off and causing this outburst of curse words.  Or when he talked about anyone more liberal than he is (which amounts to a large part of the population).  The other one:  "Shit fire and save the matches!"  He usually reserved this one gem for when he was either (a) very excited about something or (2) very sarcastic about something.  Or both.  This phrase made me cringe:  as a child, imagining flames spurting from my ass was not really something I wanted to think about.  One funny and I-swear-to-God-true-story about my father and cussing:  I was 19 years old, in college and living with my parents at the time.  One evening, I walked in the house in the foulest mood.  I hated the world, men were rotten, I felt bloated, I wanted some chocolate, get out of my way.  I was like a Nazi, goose-stepping, with a mantra of “Damn, shit, piss, hell, GD m-f’ing piece of shit!”  (Okay, this was before Prozac)  My father then stops me dead in my tracks with one of those glares from my childhood and says, “God damnit!  I told you to stop cussing so fucking much!”  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I have four dogs surrounding me right now, waiting for a bite of pizza.  One has a lethal tail, wagging and striking just about anything within a one-foot diameter.  Dogs are fabulous.  How much we can learn from them.  While I have trouble enjoying a frozen pizza (God, think of the  carbs  in that meal!!!), the dogs are just relishing a bite of something different, something other than dry dog food and the occasional treat.  There is a book out now, "Dogs Don't Bite When A Growl Will Do."  My brother, Paddy Mac, is such a bullshitter, that when he asked me what I  really  knew about the author, I thought he was just fucking with me.  It seems the co-author of this book resides here in Dallas, teaches at Richland, writes the Bow Wow! newsletter about putting fun back into work (working like a dog), married his friend and his friend's wife, and is the step-father of said friend's wife.  Here are a few chapter selections.  I am not plagarizing, as I give full credit to Matt Weinstein and Luke Barber for writing what seems to be a truly fabulous book:  Dogs Are Happy Dogs Take Praise in Stride Dogs Forgive Easily Dogs Love the One They're With Dogs Rejoice in Small Pleasures Dogs Show Their Love Openly (one of my personal favorites) Dogs Travel Lightly (yes, I do have one suitcase just for my shoes!) Dogs Like Treats Dogs Know Their Limits Dogs Lick Their Problems Dogs Scratch Where It Itches  (Dogs Don't Bite When A Growl Will Do - What Your Dog Can Teach You About Living A Happy Life - by Matt Weinstein and Luke Barber, c 2003)  The best one yet:  Dogs Know When To Let Go   I'm still trying to figure that one out!

      Another weekend at Chicken's coop.  Yes, we drank too much last night, but we were all responsible (I have this thing about drinking and driving, so MADD, if you are reading this, there's plenty of places to crash at the coop).  Yes, we had fun, playing the slot machine with the still-here Japanese coins (thanks V!), watching "Something About Mary" and toasting whatever the hell we could come up with at the time.  (A personal mea culpa to Dianne - the universe was wack last night; normally,  I'm  the one falling asleep early, so slap me for giving you grief about yawning!)  What the hell is this preposterous notion that, if you are hungover, you should drink whatever you did the night before to alleviate the hangover, therefore making yourself feel better?  I have tried this like three times and all it does is get you drunk again!  What the hell?  You know, one of my favorite movie scenes is in "Thelma and Louise," where Thelma is buying all those airplane-sized bottles of Wild Turkey, and the man behind the counter asks her if she would rather have the "economy size"???  "Thelma and Louise" - a totally underrated and overrated movie at the same time.  For anyone who's been married to an asshole like Darryl, do you  really  wonder why she turned to a life of being a fugitive?  I rest my case.  This post goes out to a certain guy named Bill:  let me just say there are absolutely no fucking regrets.  Amen.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

Favorite Drink(s): Champagne...and vodka...and Sugar Free Red Bull...and unsweetened iced tea   If I Could Rename Myself, I'd Choose: Emily Elizabeth. Or Cher.   I'm Sorta Embarrassed To Tell People: Absolutely nothing.   Personal Mantra: It's not me, it's  you   Secret(s) For My New-Found Happiness: Prozac; being honest with Vicente; loving unconditionally; NOT TAKING THINGS PERSONALLY; helping others; switching back to an Pesce Vegetarian diet; saying what I think (why wait until I'm 80?); wearing outrageous outfits;  having the most fabulous, supportive family and friends ; remembering Sparky fondly and, eventually, without tears; praying as often as it strikes me to do so; facing East; yoga; having a cocktail after work (but not too many);  WRITING AGAIN ; saving dogs; knowing  absolutely  that I had the  best parents anyone could hope for ; vine-ripened tomatoes; cheating every now and then and eating sushi;  Sadie & Buzzy ; sharing an adventure with Vicente, Lisa, Dianne, B, DK and my dogs (but not necessarily TOGETHER);  most importantly, knowing that on my deathbed, I will not look back at my life with regret, but with good and bad memories, and that I will be able to embrace them all...knowing that I  did  make a contribution, even if my name never hit the papers...knowing that, in the end, I did not disappoint my parents...knowing that Sparky knew how much I loved him...knowing that I was the best friend I could be to all those wonderful people who surrounded me my entire life...knowing I laughed as much as I could, loved as much as I could, learned as much as I could, and played as much as I could.    With love,  A VERY introspective Chicken     C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Have you ever been friends with someone who intoxicates you?  I mean this literally.  It's like you are drunk but the good-drunk, where you aren't saying stupid things yet and you haven't yet vomited, and you aren't drunk-dialing ex-boyfriends.  Someone who just being around them makes you feel like you drank three shots of vodka in 10 minutes and chased it with a leaded Red Bull?  I have a friend like that.  Actually, I have three if you count Vicente, but I'm going to talk about Lisa right now.  We leave for a late lunch (1:00 is late for me, but after last night and the vomiting, I'm not really hungry today) so she can go tan and I can get my nail fixed that broke when I shoved it into my bedside phone at 10:45 last night after a prank call (you'll get yours, Edgar).  Afterwards (yes, after Ms. High Maintenance had to go back to the nail salon and get a ridge filed down, at which I am certain the two nail techs were cursing me in Vietnamese), Lisa and I drove to Starbuck's for frappucinos.  We're in Texas, winter doesn't apply here (at least not in Dallas, not this year).  I'm going on no sleep, thought an extra dose of caffeine would be a good idea.  2:00 in the afternoon is around the time I start dragging and need a little lift.  So I order an espresso shot and we pulled up to the drive-through window.  I'm sitting with a lap full of frappucinos, I'm tired and just a little cranky about my nail.  I'm contemplating going home early.  Lisa is staring at her receipt, waiting for one last drink, and deadpans, "Leave it to Brenda to add a shot."  One of those you-had-to-be-there situations, but it started us rolling.  Together, we're like teenagers, honking and waving at guys on the side of the road cleaning up trash.  Guys who have no idea what we're saying because they don't speak English.  We're laughing and I guess the caffeine kicks in, because Lisa ends up telling me what she  really  thinks about my new sunglasses.  I liked them - Burberry frames that are kind of reminiscent of Elton John in the 70s.  I said, "Fine, you're being honest.  I'll give them to Dianne.  She liked them."  Lisa replies, "No, I don't want Dianne wearing them, either."  Undaunted, I come back with, "Well, Linda liked them.  Maybe I'll give them to her."  Lisa said, "I don't want you saying, 'Lisa doesn't like these glasses, here, you have them.'"  So I told her I'd tell Linda they hurt my eyes.  "No, tell her they hurt Lisa's eyes."  At least she was honest.  Until December and that cute little guy at the Benefit counter, I had no idea I was walking around looking like a Joan Crawford look-alike.  Lisa is impeccable with her word.  Sometimes more than I want her to be.  But she gave me cute new sunglasses so I guess that makes up for it.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I am really liking this new GF status.  I've had two dates (the wear-cute-shoes-and-stay-out-late-with-long-make-out-session-to-follow kind of dates) in the past week, and another one tomorrow night.  Not tonight, though.  Vicente needs to stay home and play with his arcade game and I need to have cocktails with Fabulous Dianne, as we haven't really had a girlie evening recently.  WAY too much testosterone around my house lately!  Okay, to be fair, it isn't like Vicente and I never went anywhere (we go to all sorts of wonderful places and have many exciting adventures).  It's just that for tomorrow night's event, he called on Tuesday to set it up.  Like back in college and all those dating "rules" that I never abided by.  Now I feel the need to buy an outfit but I'm pretty broke after losing $275 on a plane ticket and I've spent way too much money on cigarettes and Sugar Free Red Bulls (to keep me going through budgets).  Plus, no time.  You need at least two hours for the outfit, one for the shoes (or in some cases, the opposite is true).  I have a funeral tomorrow, work to do in the afternoon, "date night," more work Sunday morning through probably into the evening.  Am I bitching just a little too much?  Pardon.  Maybe it won't take too long to recycle an outfit?  Then I only have to buy new shoes...  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I think it's about time I went back to my old nickname.  No offense to those of you who call me Brendy; I'm just not comfortable with it anymore.  Sounds odd coming from someone who  likes  to call herself Chicken but what the hell?  I'm picking up another Min Pin tonight to add to the menagerie at my house.  This leaves me with my own two Min Pins, Sadie & Buzzy, the dog I'm holding for Allison, and Buddy, the new foster dog.  Lest you think I'm this old lady who has about 30 cats and 15 dogs, I'm not.  I just volunteer with a Min Pin rescue group and I happened to find the Beagle (Baxter) at work, where he was running back and forth across a busy street.  I couldn't just leave him there.  Sadie is a princess.  Let me expand:  Sadie is a bitchy little princess who bosses everyone around.  On good days, it's just a growl.  Her story is that she was found running loose for two weeks in an apartment complex in the DFW area.  I don't want to imagine what Sadie might have encountered in that time, but I'm sure it accounts for her anti-social behavior.  We're working on that but, like her owner, she wants her own damned way all the time.  Buzzy is the good boy.  He is slightly ditzy (probably due to his epilepsy) but the sweetest dog you could ever meet.  The only variance from this is when someone is eating and he wants whatever they have.  I wasn't aware a growl that deep could come from such a little guy.  The babies are spoiled fucking rotten.  I even have a doormat that says, "It's the dogs' house - we just pay the mortgage."  I've been told they are my surrogate children and although they are treated better than some children are (unfortunately), I disagree.  If I had wanted ungrateful little people with my bad traits and funky genes, I'd have popped a few out already.  That's why I like dogs.  I get to pick out the idiosyncrasies I want instead.  (Some would argue, however, that Sadie acts a  lot  like I do.)  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Our company is having executive coaching done for the corporate employees (of which I am one).  How cool was it that upon being given my first reading assignment for the second session, I discovered I had already read the book?  "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz.  It's ancient Toltec wisdom ("Ancient Chinese secret, eh?") and it is one of the most amazing non-fiction books I've read in years.  (Of course, I spent two years reading British Chick Lit books until I became nauseous at the thought of yet another "Jemima J," but I swear, I do sometimes read really deep books.)  Here are the Four Agreements:  1) Be impeccable with your word.   In other words, stop lying, bitch.  Well, actually, don't say things if you don't mean them and do not gossip - it is black magic.   2) Don't take anything personally.   I thought this would be harder to do than just about anything I've ever attempted.  But it gets easier once you do it a few times.  I'm being serious.   3) Don't make assumptions.   Let's not even repeat the ol' "ass out of you and me" mantra, okay?   4) Always do your best.   Even when you're hungover.  Even when you hate every person you see.  Even when your beloved dog has died.  Even when someone decided YOU were the one to practice machete hair-cutting skills on.  Even when you forgot to buy deodorant for three days in a row, had to use your roommate's, bought some natural lichen deodorant and felt like your armpits were Niagara Falls.  Even when you walked around campus with that toilet paper stuck to your shoe and you felt like "Josie Grossie" in "Never Been Kissed."  ALWAYS do your best.   Here is my retort (report) on how I've been doing:  1) BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD.   It's difficult to stop lying to people.  Or gossipping.   Everyone does it.  I've stopped somewhat, and the one confession I made in order to be truthful caused a lot of grief.  Still not gonna lie.  Just not gonna do anything, EVER, anymore that will get me into trouble.  I'm going to think before I speak.  Well, maybe not.  How fun can that be?  Up the dosage, please.   2) DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY.   I actually found this the least difficult of the Four Agreements to embrace.  Goes right along with my Pisces/Year of the Monkey persona.  I really like placing blame elsewhere and this one particular agreement allows me to do so.    [Okay, so it doesn't.  It still makes me feel a lot better when I can tell myself, "It's not me, it's YOU."]   3) DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.   Still working on this one.  I assume it's raining because God thinks I need to be punished, so this one may take some time.  Nothing that a little therapy and drugs won't cure, right?   4)  ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST.   Shit.  Fuck.  I always do.  Well, honestly, it might not be MY best, but it's my hungover best or my tired best or my shut-the-hell-up-I'll-do-it best or my-God-I-just-wanna-get-some-sleep best.  But it is the best of who I am at that moment.   Not bad for a Pisces hopped up on SSRIs, Sugar Free Red Bulls and Marlboro Ultra Lights, eh?  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I think he read one.  The one entry where I signed it with a "Shiny, Happy, Wet Lip Gloss Peck."  But not the rest of them.  So...to make this interesting, I will write about him until he notices these posts and can give me a full book report, double-spaced, eight hundred words minimum.  Session One:  Vicente's Eyes  V got lasik surgery last Christmas season.  We were all very excited about it.  The suction cups slipped off during the procedure and Vicente was left with no whites in his eyes.  Seriously.  His eye whites were BLOOD red.  It went away about a month later.  Vicente looks normal now.   Next, we'll talk about Vicente's legs...   C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      It is 3:30 p.m. and I'm just now catching my breath at work.  I'm cranky, I want to take a nap (even though that is about all I did this weekend, sleep - except for the new tat and watching the boys play Saturday night), I'm PMS-ing and I'm just plain bitchy.  My boyfriend bought me the cutest slot machine this weekend.  Well, honestly, not the cutest one - that would have been the pink one with pickles but   everyone   wanted that one.  My slot machine is from Japan and it uses Japanese coins.  Vicente is going to program it to accept quarters ("Don't go to any trouble, honey").  I really wanted to play with the Japanese coins because the coins are interesting and much cuter than American coins are, but he wants his coins back.  It also has cute jungle animals on it and when you win big, it goes spastic and the ostrich gets a little crazy with the giraffe.  Vicente now has three slot machines and an old arcade game with about 4,000 video games loaded onto it.  These will all go into his media room - along with the SHAG lithos and funky lamps I helped him pick out.  When I grow up, I want to be like Vicente:  not grown up.  And I mean that in the nicest way a snarky little bitch can mean something like that.  This will make my 12th tattoo.  All of my tattoos combined make up about  one  of my brother's.  This one joined two other, smaller stars on my right shoulder - a pink and purple tie-dyed star.  Sort of a tribute to the decade I wish I'd grown up in.  I am serious...this is the  LAST  tattoo I'm getting.  Whatever.  Chicken  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Okay, Lisa - the Fruscheta is pretty damned good.  You know I'm partial to Tony's individual deep dish cheese pizzas, but this is a welcome change.  And we both know I've been eating too damned many of those bean & cheese tacos (extra cheese, lots of salsa) from the Cabana lately.  Here's something to ponder:  Which character would you have choosen to be on "Gilligan's Island"?  Would you be the girl-next-door, Maryanne?  Or the filthy rich Mr. Howell?  Or his poodle of a wife, Lovey?  Just think, if you were the Skipper, you could be fat, eat all you want, wear the same white pants and blue golf shirt every day, and people would still call you jovial.  I would not have chosen Gilligan, simply because he was basically brain-dead.  The Professor was always sexy, in my opinion.  I went to his website (who knew?  I always wondered what happened to him) and he is not bad looking for an older man.  Kinda gave in to the Skipper's eating habits, but shit, when I'm older, I am not going to be heading to the gym three times a week, either (not that I do now, but I'm always meaning to start it up).  As a child, I was extremely influenced by Ginger.  I know that most men, when polled, would rather have done Maryanne, but Ginger was it for me.  Of course, she wore that same damned evening gown all the time (like people take those kinds of clothes on a small boat), but what I really loved was the  mole .  I used to take eyeliner and paint one on my face when I was a teenager.  I'm heading off to see a friend's band play in Fort Worth (Oliver's Army - Elvis Costello cover band) so I better get ready before everyone starts bitching at me for holding them up.  I think I'll paint on a mole tonight...  Shiny, Happy, Wet Lip Gloss Peck, Chicken  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I bribed my brother and Dale to go get me some bean & cheese tacos (extra cheese) from the Cabana, paying them $16 to do so.  They didn't believe me that my blood sugar level was rapidly dropping.  They also didn't believe me that, because of my anti-depressant, alcohol affects me much quicker and more intensely than your average person.  Well, the meds and that I weigh in at about 120 now and sometimes forget to eat.  We had our palms read last night after toasting an absent B's birthday.  I forgot what my reading was...this is how we came about talking of my forgetfulness.  Dale was saying things like I just want to be mysterious and blah blah.  Now I'm really wishing I could remember what she said.  According to my alter ego last night, the woman was right on the money.  Of course, I'd probably agree with anything she said if I was drunk.  30 minutes later and I'm   still   waiting for the fucking tacos.

      I thought the title would be less offensive if it ran all together.  Okay, my first post on this site and I'm at a loss for words.  Well, not really, it's just that I'm running out of clean underwear, I ate way too much at this Mediterranean restaurant with my non-boyfriend-turned-boyfriend and his mother, consumed a bottle of this most fabulous Greek wine, and came home to two Min Pins desperate to play.  And to lick me in the mouth, a habit I've tried long and hard to break.  I'm TIRED.  I've been working 12 hour days.  I have a pile of clean towels on my bed because I've been too busy to fold them.  I think I wore the same outfite twice in the past ten days.  And I really, frightfully fear I am retaining water.  It's just way too much for your average Thursday night.  My fabulous friend B is asleep (or passed out) and then I'm-The-Mary Lisa won't answer the phone.  I'm feeling very needy right now, my fish don't talk and my dogs only want to have their bellies rubbed.  My roommate is asleep and so all I have is you, nongirlfriend.  A thought just occurred to me - why the hell would anyone post their feelings and thoughts and ideas out here for just anyone to see?  Why am I doing it?  (That question is not from me but my father, who now thinks I am insane and is probably correct in that assumption.)  I think it is all about a need to be HEARD.  Or read.  Whatever.  You know what I mean.  Three years from now, some pimply-faced 17 year old in North Sioux City can do a google on "needy" and "fish" and come across this stupid, drunken rambling (Okay, so I'm not really drunk, but it sounds better that way).  Will he be scared of 30-something wanton women on the prowl?  Or will he turn into some cliche and think that, because we've been "at it" for longer than the idiots he's recently been out with, we're better?  (Honey, we ARE better, but by the time you get to be my age, 18 doesn't seem so appealing.  You should have checked with me five years ago.)  And what the fuck do I care about any of it?  "And now for something completely different..."  Let me ask you this, and it is something I've wondered about for years:  How many scents are just too many?  I have, at this moment, 11 different colognes/perfumes in my vanity cabinet.  ELEVEN.  For a normal work week, that's two weeks of smelling completely different every day.  For weekends, minus two work days, unless of course, I have seperate weekend scents.  Then we come up with a slightly different equation.  Let's stop here, since I SUCK at math and don't really want to think about it anymore.  Why would someone buy 11 different fragrances?  Am I that bored?  Am I that ADD?  Am I missing some part of DNA that, when my peers were playing Barbies and had the Malibu Ken doll, I was cutting the hair off Skipper and making her Barbie's lesbian lover?  Was I just fucked up to begin with?  FuckitallI'mgoingtobed.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Who, bless her heart, is trapped in an SUV with three pre-pubescent boys.  She is in a delightfully wicked mood and has been making me laugh throughout the day ("Bueno!").  M/L, run away from home and come watch movies with me today.  The babies are restless and my monkey socks are itching my feet.  I'm upset by what I feel were slightly hostile emails, and V probably won't be coming back by tonight.  We could watch a couple movies together and make fun of people.  It would be the most fun.  I promise I will make the trip to BS when you let me know Dalty's soccer schedule (lest you think I never want to leave my house, since that seems to be the general consensus of everyone who knows me).  We can eat fattening food and drink vodka shots chased with champagne (on second thought, that does sound so not appealing right now).

      Like this wasn't obvious from most of my posts:  Pisces Drinking style: If you're a Pisces, you've probably already heard that you share a sign -- and an addictive personality -- with Liz Taylor, Liza Minelli and Kurt Cobain. Not only do Pisces like to lose themselves in the dreamy, out-there feeling that only hooch can give, but they build up a mighty tolerance fast.  Who needs an expensive date like that? On the other hand, theyre fabulously enchanting partners, whether in conversation or in crime.  With the right Pisces, you can start out sharing a pitcher of margaritas and wind up in bed together for days. The phrase "addictive personality" can be read two ways, you know.     urlLink Alcohoroscopes- what do the stars say about your drinking style     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Damn.

      Thinking I need more "It's Happy Bunny" stickers around here.  I switched to Sprite because water was not staying down.  Retracting earlier statement about Subway lest Jared should show up on my doorstep (I have nightmares about this really happening).  Loved Pisser's latest post - however, I did not know they still allowed you to smoke in LA?  Sat in a hot bath for twenty minutes but I'm still sick.  This sucks, because it's not even from having too good a time.  Looked in the mirror after hot bath and realized that not only do my eyebrows need serious help, I'm fucking  old .  Bday looming around the corner is not helping my mood.  Wondering at what age must I begin acting my age, or is it okay to misbehave when I'm eighty-seven?  One tired, sickly chicken, feeling pretty fowl right now.  Damn.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Slept all day.  Talked to my oldest friend for almost two hours (I've known her since 6th grade).  Feeling slightly nauseated or nauseous (never really sure which word to use), think I'm getting a migraine.  Overdosing on Excedrin Migraine and Sugar Free Red Bulls.  BF is sleeping on one of the sofas with Buzzy on top of him.  Given the amount of sleep I've had today, will be up pretty late.  Not intoxicated, just naturally loopy.  BF (Vicente, as if you didn't know) gave me three things to put on the door tonight.  Am thinking a bubble bath sounds mighty enticing right now.  Excited about my date with my niece to go Build A Bear next Friday.  Really restless, need a Xanax.  VERY excited about the upcoming Prince concert with Tams and Princette.  Still feeling like I'm going to throw up.  Been on the phone for what seems like ten minutes but am sure Vicente thinks the phone is now a part of my body.  Twenty minutes later and V is in bed with my three dogs.  Going to take a bath as stomach is still very upset, even after all the vomiting.  Never eating a Subway sandwich again.  Damn.

      But It Turned Into A Post:   ALL  organized religions are full of it.  That's why I have my own "religion" (seriously).  It's a combo of all the good parts of the world's religions, without all the animosity, bigotry, prejudice and intolerance.  I pray semi-daily (sometimes I forget) and am very conscious of my karma (I believe what goes around, comes around).  I don't believe in heaven or hell, not in the way it's portrayed in the King James Version of the Holy Bible.  I do not believe sex outside of marriage is a sin, I believe it's a biological function (in or out, who cares?).  I really do not believe in marriage, I believe in partnership.  I don't think the man runs the household and has the final word.  I believe a woman can run the household alone, but I think male influences are helpful (yin and yang, and all that).  I believe that goodness reigns over evil most of the time, and that religion does not create a path into "heaven" for you.  I also believe it is too early in the day to be thinking about this.  I think people place too much importance on this.  I believe that, when I die, I'll be okay, and that this "hell-fire and damnation" should be for people who cannot think at a higher level.  I guess it all boils down to this:  Most of my life, I've tried to be impeccable with my word, I've tried to be fair and honest and kind and loving.  Sometimes, I've failed.  I've been "roped" into some impossible situations, and I blame myself, not those who roped me in.  99% of everything I do is in the name or feeling of love.  Sometimes, I just don't get it right - I  am  human, so sue me.  I also believe that, no matter who is standing beside me or with me or is backing me up, it all depends upon me.  Damn.

      To answer you, Paddy Mac, I think about other things besides makeup.  Smartass.  I'm debating about seeing "The Passion of Christ."  I've talked to two people who have seen it and will never see it again.  One quote:  "It's 90% graphic violence," after which she proceeds to describe it, at which point I stop her.  There is nothing at all fascinating to me about watching someone get the total fucking shit beat out of them, or having nails driven through their appendages.  True, I am addicted to reading about serial killers (except, haven't been so lately), but it's  reading , not  watching .  And the more graphic ones, I simply cannot handle.  I know what a crucifixion is; don't need to have it displayed on a big screen for me.  Since crucifixion was a common method of punishment (damned Romans) in those days, many "bad" people suffered the same fate.  I don't want to see them die, either.  My religious background is Missionary Baptist, but I left the church due to rampant hypocrisy and politics, all "in the name of God."  I saw hatefulness, I saw bigotry.  Then the same guilty parties would take the Lord's Supper and say "amen" to everything the pastor said (sorry, can't bring myself to write "preacher").  The next to last time I was in a church (last time, to hear D sing, I was afraid of spontaneous combustion), I was in a Southern Baptist church.  During the sermon, the pastor said (and imagine this in a hick-like, backwoods, sorta redneck accent, which only makes it worse), "Now, I'm not saying that AIDS is God's way of getting rid of the homosexuals and the drug addicts.  It is, but we need to have love and sympathy for them as well."  And people wonder why I don't go back?  Let's end it this way:  I've read the King James Version of The Holy Bible straight through three times.  I know what Jesus Christ went through.  I don't think I need a visual.  Damn.

      Weekend of the 12th/13th, right?  I REALLY need to get out.  I haven't left the Ville in weeks.  (Okay, so I exaggerate.  I leave it every day, I left the weekend of V-day, it's just that it's been one hell of a start to 2004.)  Fab D is in, I may get Lisa in, Paddy Mac will probably go, and if things keep going the way they are with V's situation, he may come along, too.  I'm thinking pub crawl.  I'm also thinking one of my circle  really  needs to drive that night.  Damn.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      (This post's title courtesy of Vicente, who has been picking at me lately, most likely because I suck domestically - by choice - and I finally did laundry last night)  Well, Sephora is not as clever as Amazon, so when I tried to post my wish list for upcoming bday (for you early shoppers), it linked it to where I sign in.  Not good.  So I decided to post it here (  hint, hint  ),  just in case you're wondering :   Benefit  Bathina Sandal Scandal Bathina "Touch  Me Then Try To Leave..."

      FIFTH time I tried to go eat at the new Pappadeaux in D'ville.  It was closed for lunch.  I'm beginning to think it is some kind of omen, like maybe I shouldn't even try to eat there, but God, I love their crawfish bisque and will cheat and eat it.  And I love their Alexander sauce on my snapper (no smart remarks, please).  Their Greek salad is pretty good, too.   So why can't I ever seem to make it inside?    Maybe this is what's been upsetting me lately.  (Ha, if only that were true...sigh)  Overheard at lunch yesterday, at (ick) Red Lobster, although my lunch was pretty good:  "That Jesus Christ was fucking hot!"  It seems that last year, when Lisa and J went to see "The Promise" down in Glen Rose, J was quite taken with our Father's Son.  The diehard Catholics at the table did not see the humor in it.  Unlike me, who is certain that God has a rather good sense of humor.  Now  I  want to go see "The Promise," even though I typically shun all things religious.  (No, I am  not  an atheist - I have my own "religion" which is a blend of several major worldwide beliefs.)  On that note, I have mixed feelings about seeing the Mel Gibson movie this weekend.  I abhor violence - why would I subject myself to that?  I may go.  I may just wait for it on Netflix.  For some reason, I always feel guilty when walking out of a movie, even if I cannot stand it.

      Listening to POE has  not  cheered me up.  I am depressed.  Wish I could go traipsing (is that really a word?) through the streets of London or Paris, having high tea, eating fabulous French cheeses and getting loaded.  It'd be difficult to leave the babies for a week, though.  When V took me to Europe three years ago (God, it's been  that  long?), I called four times to check on the Sparkster.  Of course, he had just been diagnosed with Addison's Disease, but even that is a little excessive.  What the hell was I going to do   if   something had been wrong?  Fly home?  As it was, Sparky did very well, didn't seem to miss me that much, and I had the most fabulous time.  Other than running around with Vicente and Chad all day in Paris that Saturday/Sunday, and of course the "hooky" day, I think my fave parts of the trip were when I was on my own.  I've always wanted to be single-girl-on-her-own-in-big-foreign-city, and I was.  My mother thought I was crazy (so did V) to go walking the streets of London by myself late at night, but it was nothing less than exhilarating.  When can I go back?  Damn.

      There's a lot of butt-sniffing going on this morning.  Since I was the nicest and slept in the den with my pack of wild dogs so V could get some sleep, I took them all into my bedroom this morning to say hello to Vicente.  Here's a sample of what transpired:  Buzzy, the oldest and one of mine, kept going back and forth between V and me, licking our arms.  Sadie (mine too) slept with V because she is the only one who will sleep the entire night straight through.  Sadie always sleeps in between Vicente's legs, making him quite nervous this morning, as she was growling at the invading four dogs.  No damage was done, V's still intact (thank God), but she was a feisty one.  Coco, the foster (female), started feeling at home enough to show us her  true  colors.  She's still a pup and so is Nico (mine), so they play-fought constantly.  Mocha, the male foster, just sat by me, doing absolutely nothing to get involved in the melee.  I wish V had his video camera.  Coco kicks her back legs out behind her like a pissed-off horse.  The entire thing was pretty amusing.  Have to work on some crime reports this afternoon, so I think I'll nap for about an hour to be fresh and rested.  I'm hoping no distractions will arrive (in the form of Fab D or Vicente) until  much  later.  My summary has to be done before work tomorrow, and I don't want to push the envelope right now.  Damn.

      Well,  this sucks .  First of all, here I am trying to get all cute and shit for the BF, who does not tell me he's starving, and who is VERY mad by the time my finally-cute-ass hits the door, mad to the point of no conversation (rare between V and the Chicken), we make the trip to Pappadeaux, too long a wait, then I suggest Luby's since it's right across the street and he's acting like he's having a low-blood-sugar attack, and we decide upon Olive Garden.  (WOW, long sentence)  So we wait at OG for what seems like forever, I forgot my cigs so we walk down the street a half a block, and while I'm being rung up by George (my all time favorite convenience store personality), the goddamn pager goes off for dinner.  Of course, since we weren't RIGHT THERE when it did go off, we have to wait a bit longer.  I am wondering when Vicente is going to start nibbling on Chicken's wings or something, and then we are seated.  Right across from this loud, obnoxious, bratty child.  I paid for the fucking meal because I felt so guilty.  And all I really wanted was for at least one person to tell me I looked cute for my effort.  Fuck it.  Now V's in bed (I promised the dogs and I would sleep elsewhere), in a great king-sized bed, and I am pounding away at the keyboard, wondering where the fuck four feisty dogs and I are going to sleep.  (I know I have five.  Vicente allows that bitch Sadie to sleep with him!  Should I be jealous?)  This  really  sucks.  Not only is my hair fabulous (for once, goddamnit), but I had a cute outfit on and I smell incredible.  Okay, so I'm feeling sorry for myself.  SO FUCKING WHAT???  I need to vent.  March 6th is my bday, V will have his kid for all of March, and I really think this was supposed to be the bday celebration.  And fuck! the wine I'm drinking tastes like  shit  because all I can taste is the goddamned cork.  Maybe I should phone my physician on Monday and ask him to up the dosage?  Or maybe I should just have an ice cream sundae and go the fuck to bed with the four dogs, on the couch?  Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. DAMN.  Damn.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      (this one's for you, Dalty)   Many thank-yous  to Paddy Mac and MP (Pitt), who took the BF hiking so I could recover from a major sinus headache.  Feels more like a lobotomy, but I guess after the 19th dose of aspirin and Sudafed kick in, I'll be okay.  V is taking me to Pappadeaux tonight and after that, I'm going to try to convince him to swing by Blackberries, since the last time we were there (for Lis' bday, last weekend), I made an ass of myself doing the Elaine Dance and falling on the dance floor.  Don't know if he'll go for the idea but it's worth a try to see her shocked that I actually show up.  I  really  want the blackened Snapper Alexander for dinner, but I'm wondering if it would be way UHM to ask them to not include the crawfish in the Alexander sauce since they have legs?  I am also wondering if I am taking this Pesce vegetarianism a little too far?  Please do not comment on this.  I  realize  I have serious food issues.  My mood has become somewhat more, eh, "gracious" since yesterday.  Last night, I was ready to start shooting at people randomly.  Good thing I don't have any guns (nor do I want any, five dogs is enough protection unless you're on a date).  It is atypical of me to be that angry for any length of time.  Maybe that is why my lunch, etc., weren't staying down?  Anger is a poison and I can literally feel it in my stomach when I am that pissed off.  I keep picking up Lucky magazine and thinking, "I really need to get a subscription to this and save some $$$."  (I  do  see dollar signs while thinking to myself, it's weird, I know.)  However, since there is no methadone or antabuse for shopping, or then perhaps repo (and that doesn't always work), I think I'm safer off buying the odd issue here and there for about 3.5 times the price.  Why did I buy this particular one, though?   God, the  spring shoes  issue!   I am  in love  and will be adding kitten heels to my list of crushes over on the side of this blog.  Just wish I had some money to purchase said kitten heels.  I'm not talking Prada or even Nine West.  I'm talking Payless, because I blew my wad in Sephora and on French Kitty t-shirts.  And because I was wearing those fabulous patent leather knee high boots with the stiletto heels while I was shopping, I forgot about shoes.  Damn.  The herd of Min Pins woke me up EARLY (try five) this morning and for some reason, I could not fall back to sleep like I can during the week, when I really don't need to.  So I start watching Netflix's latest shipment, "Thirteen," hoping I didn't make a mistake because teen angst can be  so  annoying if it isn't done properly.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I felt like I was thrust back to my teenage years, yelling at my parents, saying "fuck" a lot and making out with unsuitable guys (wait, I  still  say "fuck" a lot).  Quite disturbing.  Then my mother calls in the middle of the movie with some tragedy and I feel guilty, like I did when she first found out I smoke.  I felt like I should be knitting or fucking gardening or  something , not  enjoying  watching the demise of two teenaged girls.  Not considering myself a Siskel or an Ebert (which one is the dead one?), I don't pretend to be all academic or deep when proclaiming a movie "amazing" or even "good."  This movie was pretty good, but I think a lot of it was due to the fact that (a) it brought back strange memories I'd forgotten, and (b) all the shaky camera shooting.  Somehow, that (and dark filtering at the top of the screen - think "Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her," which I LOVED) really grabs me.  Nikki Reed, who plays the "bad influence" and who co-wrote the screenplay, was gorgeous in the bad-girl way we all envied in high school.  It is easy, as an adult, to see how quickly and deeply someone can be seduced into behaving very differently than they were raised.  It also made me think that deep down in everyone's nature, their true personality and way of thinking/feeling/acting is set, and that it doesn't often change.  Take me, for example.  I was "shy" growing up but wanted to say and do all these outrageous things.  That has always been a part of my mental and emotional make-up.  However, I lacked the confidence to pull it off until YEARS later.  Partially, or maybe even mostly, I was afraid of being called "weird" or "strange," two words that I now use to describe myself.  It's the non-conformity thing, I suppose.  Most people don't like to stick out like sore thumbs.  I'm no different now, though.  I just grew up and put a band-aid on it.  I'm going out on a limb here and showing how not-cool I am - I did not see "Donnie Darko."  In fact, I thought he was a musician until the other day, on the Edge, they were talking about a song on the Donnie Darko soundtrack.  Posts like this are ones that earned me the honor of being called an idiot on  urlLink Idiot Blogs .  I'm a busy girl, I often work 65 - 70 hours a week.  This time of year, even more.  Okay, no excuse for being ignorant, especially since I love the Gyllenhaals.  Both Jake and Maggie are equally sexy, and if you haven't seen "The Secretary," you  must .  Terrific movie, especially for James Spader fans (except the ending was too happy, I wanted her to self-mutilate some more).  Anyway, back to DD.  I go to work and look up Donnie Darko on Netflix and think, what a fucked-up movie,   have   to move it to the top of my queue ("queue" is an odd word - why not just "que"?  is it really necessary to include that second "ue"?).  Somehow, don't think this one will be anything close to "Harvey The Rabbit."  Fuck, I'm rambling again.  Probably should go get ready for the day, being that it  is  4 p.m. and all...or else sneak in a couple Scottie videos before the boys come home.  Damn.

      I need a name for my two new fosters and have run out of them over the past year.  E wants to call the boy, who is a chocolate Min Pin, Cocoa, but I'm thinking that once he gets neutered next Thursday, he may have issues and decide to start singing show tunes while trying on my underwear.  I like Rocco, but that gets confusing with my own Nico.  The girl, who is a red Min Pin, I was going to call Honey, but isn't that sort of ghetto?  I'm at a loss.  And I need help!

      God, I am way dating myself with a reference to that fucking commercial from the 70s.  I want to know if I have permission to pack up my three Min Pins, my two foster Min Pins, a carton of MULs, three vats of wine and run away?  No?  Well, then, do I have to answer my phone all weekend?  I'm just not having a good 48 hours.  Have to go into the office tomorrow because I won't get my work done if I am playing referee to five dogs who aren't used to each other yet.  (Kevin,  PLEASE  come home!!  I have your foster dogs!)  V is nowhere to be found when I  really  need a "HELLO Chicken!" from him.  I started my fucking period, no cramps to warn me, so that means this month's "visit" is really gonna suck.  Need to eat, don't want to eat, been told I need to stop losing weight so now I have the eating disorder police on my back.  Feel sorry for myself (and I  hate  when I feel sorry for myself) because I'd really rather be sucking down massive amounts of alcohol with the DFW bloggers than sitting here bitching to no one in particular.  I am one angry Chicken.  Man, I got fucked yesterday.  BAD.  Bad bad bad bad bad.  If anyone is heading to New Orleans, please pick up one voodoo doll for me.

      This day had "bad karma" written all over it:  No mas Taco Cabana for me.  That was a bad choice for breakfast.  Fab Dianne, my usual Friday Night Partner In Crime, is having Christmas with her friend Pamela (in February??? She's worse than I am!).  Normally, I don't care if I'm by myself  at all ; tonight, I really need a friend.  Can't bring myself to eat my coke float, which usually helps my stomach.  V is unavailable tonight and will tell me I asked for it, anyway (actually, no he wouldn't, that's what I'm telling myself).  I'm freezing and I damn well shouldn't be.  Tom Thumb is out of Freschetta 4-Cheese Pizza, a staple (watch them be out of WINE, too, my luck).  I think it's obvious the Prozac did  not  stay down with the Taco Cabana foodstuff.  Not even listening to my new mix with Scottie on it is cheering me up (perhaps watching my DVD again tonight will?).  It's a beautiful day outside but I'm in a cloudy day mood.  I would like to rewind about three years and correct a couple of errors in judgment.  Is that an option?  Damn.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I couldn't sleep last night.  Sometimes, the insomnia is a good thing.  Colored my hair this morning (actually, it is still processing as I write).  The dogs aren't used to momma even being coherent before seven and are probably thinking, "What the fuck?"  Maybe I will be at work on time for once this year.  Maybe not.  Allergies are a major problem for everyone I know right now.  In fact, everyone I know right now sounds just like me: clearing their throats, sneezing occasionally, complaining about their sinus headaches.  That is why I would like to thank Paddy Mac for telling me this morning, "You know, you have 'smoker's cough.'"  What a truly pleasant thing to wake up to.

      I heard that saying all the time while growing up (not the above line, but this:  If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all).  My mom's favorite one to throw at me was, "If you don't have anything to say, don't speak."  Obviously, neither adage stuck.  In fact, most proverbial warnings/sayings/cliches never did.  I'm like Teflon to good advice and sage wisdom.   Random Thoughts:   One adage I had absolutely no problem with, however, was "Eat, drink and be merry."  I keep thinking about JEB saying, "Well, I'm sure you'll remodel your bathroom soon."  I've had this house for four years, lost my higher-paying job that allowed me the luxury of eating on a regular basis, spent around $3k on vet bills alone last year,  and  I discovered Benefit in the past four months (okay, so I live under a rock, so shoot me).   Yeah, I'm gonna remodel soon.   And soon, too, I'll have monkeys fly out of my ass.  The door is not obsessing me as much as it did.  I think I am afraid to finish it.  Plus, I ran out of krazy glue.  Don't join Oliver's Army.  I did, look what happened to me.  (By the way, guys, I'm plugging you now.  I expect NO COVER CHARGE at the next gig, K?)  Buzzy is an unusual Min Pin:  he minds me, he doesn't bark that much and he never tries to run out the front door.  I'm hoping some Buzz will rub off on the other two.  If you find something you're passionate about, do it.  Fuck whatever everyone else thinks.  Unless, of course, it's dealing drugs.  Or watching The Shopping Channel.  What famous leader am I?  JFK.  Jesus Christ!  (Not the leader, the saying)  Whatever.   I'm obsessed with that song by Phoenix, "Too Young."  MUST buy "Lost in Translation" soundtrack...  Dogs' mouths are allegedly cleaner than humans'.  Maybe we should start licking ourselves and eating shit, too?  I've found that I try to find something funny in everything that happens.  Seems to occur more often when it's inappropriate.  In reference to my blog, someone said to me the other day, "It must be nice, living in that world inside your head."  Not when the voices get too loud, it isn't.  I really wish my parents had named me Lola.  My  whole life  would have been different.  Don't take anything I say or do while under the influence seriously.  In fact, that goes for sober as well.  It is difficult to have three dogs and only two hands/one lap.  Already this year, I've spent almost $500 in vet bills.  (Please God, let this year not be a repeat of 2003.)  The dryer buzzed.  Fuck, I have to go fold clothes.  I'm very blessed - things could be a  lot  worse.  I could have children.  I still feel 21 sometimes (and act it, too).  The Elaine Dance is not something I should attempt after numerous glasses of champagne and a large container of saki.  Quail egg shots are fabulous.  Trust me on this.  Buzzy walks backwards more often than I realized.  I've become quite skilled at opening champagne.  Someone wanted my opinion tonight.  How foolish of him.  It's hard to ignore a barking dog.  Try three.  If they have those DVDs that keep pets entertained while you're out, can't they make them for annoying co-workers who have nothing better to do than to bother you?  Nico seems to be Sparky, Jr.  An equally lovely  and  disconcerting discovery.  I AM working on my book, V.  Promise.  Right after I do this, fold clothes, have a glass of wine, watch a movie and go to bed.  A little bird told me MP is reading my blog.  Again, I ask, please, no cover!  The bars make out quite nicely on my cocktail tab alone.  That last one cost V $120.  ADD seems to run in our family.  Is that a Drake's Coffee Cake?  How do we know the dog food is  really  good?  Don't dogs eat their own vomit?  Never send a link to your blog to a colleague or client.  Trust me on this one, too.  Shae, if you are reading this, I haven't played The Sims in  four weeks !  Unbelievable.  My dog Sadie and I have identical personalities.  I often lunge at strangers, too.  Why, oh why, did they have to put out a magazine on  shopping ?!  No casualties in the tank today.  Think the ick is gone.  I heard the strangest story from an ex-Dallas cop this afternoon:  He was following a Corvette doing about 110 through an intersection near my office, at which it's wise to slow way down because of the dip.  Corvette didn't, flipped, sailed through the air, plowed through the street light on the median and completely killed the car.  Driver gets out, totally polluted, says to the officer, "That's why I buy Corvettes.  They're good cars to have wrecks in."  ( Does  Car & Driver  know this? )  Three weeks later, he and his partner were following another Corvette doing about 90 on I-20.  Officer "Larry" told his partner about following another Corvette that flipped doing 110.  So they start to follow this one.  As the Corvette is  trying  to exit Highway 67, it drives right off the overhead and crashes down to I-20.  Car is completely killed again.  They drive down to investigate, same guy gets out of his car and tells Officer "Larry", "See, I told you why I buy Corvettes."  (Do you think Officer "Larry's"  pulling my leg?)

      Okay, I have a new crush.  (Move over, Scottie...)  This has been brewing since, oh, since the Saturday after Thanksgiving when Vicente and I watched Spike Jonez's DVD with all those shorts on it and the Weezer video, not to mention the fabulous Beastie Boys.  Before I knew it was him, I thought he was cute (but ignorant) in "Three Kings," and that it was terribly sad that he died, but grateful to Ice Cube that he took him to the burial site.  I LOVED "Being John Malkovich."  I LOVED "Adaptation."  I think I loved "Adaptation" more because it was even stranger than BJM.  Then, this weekend, I watched for the THIRD time "Lost In Translation," except this time, while watching with V, we watched the "on the set" bullshit all DVDs seem to have these days.  I never got to see him, but that voice!  And God!  Those dance scenes with "Praise You" and those  really  bad actors!  I haven't laughed that hard since Will Farrell's best on SNL.  It is such fun acting like I am still 15.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      And I'm goddamned proud of it.  In fact, it is like a dream come true for me, this public acknowledgement of my idiocy.  I've suspected it for quite some time and boom, some random stranger reads my blog and turns my world upside down.  Thank you, oh Geo Cities Idiot Blogs Person.  I'm honored.  I'm  fucking  honored.  I'm naming my next rescue dog after you ("Idiot").  I think I'll have "Idiot" tattooed on my ass, in hot pink, that way, anyone who is back there knows what I think of them (save Vicente, who is definitely   not   an idiot, but one of the smartest people I've met).  In fact, I think I'll start calling people "Idiot" at work.  I'm sure it will raise my standing amongst the office crowd.  They'll be talking about it at the water cooler, I'll be so popular.  Because everyone  loves  to be called an idiot.  Don't you know that?  I had three phone calls this evening, all congratulating me on being an idiot.  As Vicente would say, "You're an idiot, but you're a  cute  idiot!"  Since when did "idiot" connote such negative feelings?  I think the world should embrace the idiots, take them into their arms, and let them know it is  okay  to be an idiot...it takes all kinds, right?  And, I think I'll have more friends now that I'm an idiot.  They won't be as frustrated anymore.  They will think, "Aw, isn't she cute?  She's doing the Elaine Dance again and, oh, what's this?  Oh, she's trying to remove her tights once more...good thing she's an idiot.  Wouldn't she be embarrassed if she weren't?"  This is the best day of my life.  Now I know my  true  calling.

      The bad mood from last night is still lingering, something I cannot seem to shake off.  I've been burning CDs to avoid getting ready for work (woke up at 3:43 a.m. again, and drifted in and out of not-so-good sleep for three hours), but now it seems inevitable.  I am not even interested in what I will wear today.  May I please rewind to Friday night again, and then have the "Groundhog Day" effect take place?  With the outside temp at about 70 degrees and no snow?  I  thought  I was asking for too much.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      As I was visiting Fluffy Happy Bunnies' blog today, I read that she received an honor by being listed on a site naming "idiot blogs."  And that Pissed Kitty was listed there as well.  Fuck, have these half-wits not yet seen "Sometimes My Balls Feel Like Tits" or the ubiquitous "Hot Abercrombie Chick"??  Have they not looked at  mine ?  I was not happy that someone was dissing fellow hometown blogger FHB.  I was not happy that I actually thought to use the word "dissing."  So I decided to go on a quest for my own idiot blogs.  Put mine at the top of the list:  1, 2 and 3 -  mentioned above   4 - "Fuck You Too" - Yeah, but he  is  18, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.  Just stop posting Incubus lyrics, hon.  We can get them off the Internet ourselves.  5 - "beandip" - Meet Amanda.  Amanda is in love.  With everything.  And the object of her affection changes on a daily basis.  Amanda should visit her university infirmary and request some medication.  Ah, but at least she turned me on to Rum and Monkey.  6 - ANY BLOGGER THAT PUTS THEIR OWN PEDANTIC POETRY AS A POST - Stop it.  Now.  Or else you will force me to do the same, and that would be scary.  And painful.  7 - "Connect, Relate and Resonate" - Honestly, besides the whole religious thing, the only prob I have with this blog is that someone is posting comments on his site, and they are calling themselves "Chicken."  Oh, and what the fuck is Kaya?  Will someone let me know?  8 - "Thoughts From Cake" - Vivian, please stop using those smileys.  K?  ;)  9 - Any blog about weight loss, with the exception of Poundy, who is a talented and hilarious writer.  I love Poundy.  10 - "duk vs chiken" - I cannot even figure this one out.  At least my blog has a consistent theme, alcoholism.  Oh, and the door.  11 - "Hours" - No wonder this person is a virgin.  Someone, help!  Quickly!  12 - "Group Poop" - Literally, a bunch of shit.  13 - "Jack Rascal" - I love dogs, you all know that, but this is a little too much love.  And I hope to God my dogs don't think of me as their "mistress" - it feels a bit too dominatrix for my comfort.  Now...for the list of great or at least amusing blogs I found while searching for the inane ones (not to include those I read (almost) daily) - please note the list is  much  shorter:   urlLink  Rum and Monkey    and   urlLink  Other Crap    and   urlLink  Biffa's Blog    Hey, feel more than welcome to slam my blog as well.  I'm no Cynthia Heimel.  But at least I know my limitations.  Besides, I crave degradation.  It's something I learned from childhood.   C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      AMAZING V-day, never a better one.  Vicente and his co-conspirator out did themselves.  CC's wife and I were amazed at the planning these two went to.  First of all, V would not tell where we were going on our double-date.  I had the feeling sushi was going to be involved and was not disappointed.  I was surprised, however, when Paddy Mac looked out the front windows and asked, "Who is that??"  I was thinking the limo was for the house across the street, but Vicente said, "Come on, Chicken, let's go."  I won't bore you with the details, except to say it was a seven hour extravaganza with a surprise around every corner.  And V scored many points in my book.  I would have loved to have gone anywhere, even just sushi to go would have been fine - I never expected a date like this, but I loved it.  They had this planned for weeks and went through with it even though Vicente was still sick and I talked them in to keeping the limo four more hours.  I'm sure we were less well-behaved than high school kids on prom night.  (Thanks to Jim, our driver,  the  coolest)  (Thanks V, for my angel and devil Min Pins - my new favorite present ever - and thanks for the rest of my gifts, and for an incredible night!  This is pretty close to London and Paris)  P.S.:  I only flashed people a few times, and no permanent damage was done to anything except for that one contact that got stuck in my eye.  Don't ask if someone hit me; it is  not  a black eye.  And I did not get thrown out of the topless bar, so we're all cool, just a little hungover.

      1) In 40 years, I  will  be Maxine.  2) I hate to clean.  3) Why should  I  cook when you can?  Or better yet, let's go out for dinner!  4) My dogs will  always , repeat   always  , come before you or any other person on the face of this earth.  Don't fuck with them.  5) I can't stand being around the same person for an extended period of time (unless it's Lisa or Dianne).  We'd have to have separate residences.  6) I'll inevitably embarrass you when you least expect it.  7) No, goddamnit, I am  not  going to quit smoking! (At least, not  yet .)  8) You'll never get to see me at night because I'm on the phone with my friends or blogging until all hours, or playing The Sims.  I need my space.  9) I don't want to sell my house and move, and I really don't need another roommate (unless D becomes available, sistah!)  10) I'm more monogamous when I don't  have  to be.  11) Fuck this, "third time's a charm" notion.  Such bullshit.  It's obvious I'm no good at matrimony.  12) I'm too lazy to change my name with the Social Security office, and you'd be offended if I didn't take your name (neanderthal that you are).   P.S.:  This post is not for Vicente, who, like me, does not want to make that terrible trip down the aisle again.  This post is for the rest of you.  Be glad I "got away."

      I stop in Target yesterday morning to buy some Vday and bday cards, and I end up leaving with those, and with wine charms, coasters (well, they came with the charms) and note cards.  My parents do not understand what is so necessary about having 15 different scents to choose from (ah, I've been shopping recently, up from 11!), but Vicente does.  However, Vicente makes much more money than the Chicken, so V can shop the way he does, while C is floating from paycheck to paycheck.  (At least I don't have car payments anymore.)  My slight problem is that I am a sucker for cute packaging.  Jesus, I bought fucking nail polish in a shade I already had just because the bottle was so tiny.  Oh, and if a product has a cute name, I might as well get a second mortgage because that product will haunt my dreams and waking hours, lingering in the back of my mind, slowly driving me crazier, until I break down and go buy the goddamned thing.  (I promise, Mom, the Prozac is helping my depression, but it's making me want to shop like hell!)  Before the Four Agreements, I would worry that others would shake their heads (behind my back, of course, except for my parents, who have absolutely  no  problem at all expressing their discontent with me), sigh and wonder, "What the hell is the matter with that girl?!"  I would worry someone might think, and even be rude enough to flat out say to me, "God, you are such a loser."  But now that I know it is not about me, it's about the other person, I've been able to shop profusely without guilt, without fear of catty remarks and references to my old truck (fuck you, it gets me there, it has a radio and AC/heat).  I have been able to leave shops with purchases I cannot afford and not have a panic attack.  To worry some of you fair readers less, I actually am putting part of the tax refund into savings.  I fucking hate money.  I love having money, but I hate what money does to most people.  And, living in the image-conscious city of Dallas, I've noticed I'm treated differently because of what I drive.  To me, that is so hilarious I don't even get offended anymore.  I valet park my 1993 Ford Ranger because I am lazy and do not want to walk too far, not because I am afraid someone will hit it.  Bang away, can't make it much more dented than it is now.  AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE A CAR PAYMENT OF $650, DRIVING SOME CAR I CANNOT AFFORD JUST SO MY NEIGHBORS AND COLLEAGUES THINK I MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I REALLY DO.  I  like  Ol' Red - she has character and is pretty feisty for such an aging gal.  Why am I off on this tangent?  My mother invited me down for breakfast and since I really don't like to cook for just one person, I accepted.  (For those of you who don't know me, I live up the street from my parents, on purpose, so walking in the snow this morning was quite fun.)  My parents are riding me about not taking care of myself (smoking, drinking, not eating meat, etc.) and I told them, "But I don't want to live to be an old person."  Of course, that set my father right off (I think he was waiting for me to say something, so I didn't want to disappoint the guy), who told me when I am 45 or 50, I  will  care, especially when I start having health problems.  Have they forgotten my mid-20s, when I had ten operations to try and regulate my fucked-up reproductive system?  I  know  what it is like to be ill,  chronically  ill.  That is why I don't want to be an old person because the deterioration of my health  will  happen.  The same thing for money.  Of course, I want to be able to take care of myself when I'm older.  I'm not an idiot, I know I need financial stability.   But it's been so fun without it!   I look at it this way:  In the past, I've always found a way around fiscal obstacles.  I'm smart, I'm creative, and I am   very   persuasive.   I  will  be okay.   Only if I stay out of Sephora.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      [Title of this post courtesy of Lisa, who is the most fabulous because her bday is tomorrow]  The door is coming along fabulously - looking like the inside of a 16-year-old girl's head.  Took to drawing on the door with permanent markers (don't you just  love  Sharpies?).  I think Lisa is the wisest person I know (in regards to relationships).  One day, when I'm 87, I'm going to look back on this and think, "Thank fucking God I didn't listen to those who told me to 'straighten up'."  I love my four dogs (Sparky included) more than anything else I can think of.  Still think  kissing  is the  most  fun out of all sexual activities.  Burned down to 1/4 of my LOLA candle... must  buy perfume...  It is 8:30 and I'm already pissed.  I'm such an Anglophile.  I love anything British.  No one knows this about me until now, not even Lisa/Dianne/Vicente/Sparky:  I don't care to pee in the dark.  I'm afraid spiders will crawl out and bite my ass.  I think to write for a living would be the most  fabulous  career.  But writing for fun, for me, is my most favorite activity.  And I really don't care if anyone else likes it - I  love  reading my blog.  I've recently been checking "Other" on race and, when asked to be specific, type "European-American."  Most men I have met/dated/whatever:  * are homophobic * are ignorant when it comes to  really  good wines * think "dressing up" means putting on a  new  pair of Nikes * feel threatened by a "dominant" (i.e., "assertive") female presence * are clueless about giving head * think flowers excuse anything * are going to cheat (new pussy and all that) * are ones who would love to love a woman who is independent, doesn't need him, is only there because she wants to be * are frightfully afraid of such women described above  Goddamnit.  I don't know how  any  woman stays sane!  Of course, Vicente isn't like this...not much at all.   C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I'm starting this post at 9:01 p.m.  Let's see how long it takes for me to bitch about my fucked-up day...  I do not understand my current state of bitchiness:  should  not  be PMS-ing (if I am, I'm fucked, because it's too soon, and I don't want to go back on hormones again), got enough sleep (too much), Buzzy hurt his leg and ended up spending the entire day at the vet ($267), my truck's rotors went out (what the fuck are rotors anyway? are they important? why do they eat my belts? I HATE AUTOMOBILES!), I spent too much at Pier I and Barnes & Noble last night, I want more perfume from Sephora (Cacherel's "Amor, Amor!"), my head hurts, I think I'm re-catching my cold (sorry that I gave it to you, Vicente), I have a friend in need, sorta hungry but not motivated to cook, I really don't like being an adult (except for the smoking, drinking, sex parts), wish I could find my piano lesson books from 4th grade, want to get slovenly drunk but have to go to work in the a.m., worry about $$$ incessantly, I'm thinking of packing up and moving to a warmer/animal-friendly state, feel  very  misunderstood, think I need a much more creative job, I ate fabulous Mahi-Mahi tacos today who feel the need to spawn up my throat, miss my friend DK terribly, have burned 1/2 of my LOLA candle (that is ten bucks, folks), didn't do the work I was supposed to do tonight (self-imposed masochism), I started thinking about Sparky and got really sad, the weather sucks, it may snow/ice on V-day (and V gives me  the  best V-days ever!), talked to my beautiful Vicente and he is way sick, whoo just checked my bank account balance, want implants but cannot find any venture capitalists to fund, need a haircut, have seven books and 17 magazines to read, ran out of vodka and/or champagne.  Jesus, and people wonder why I chain-smoke???  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      The experience yesterday after having my staple food splattered all over the northeast corner of North Park Mall's parking garage has put me off the Cabana for a few days.  I am not saying it was food poisoning - I simply waited far too long to eat (the blood sugar level thing again) and probably ate too fast.  Then I did it again today.  Couldn't leave for lunch until I finished something, had to pick up one of V's Valentine gifts, drove to the local sushi place, they were closed due to moving to much nicer, brand new facility, drove to Sandwacker's, ordered too much and ate too fast.  Now I feel I must purge again.  I swear to all of you, this is not an on-going thing, and the Prozac does help people like me who think that after we eat, the most natural thing to do is smoke a cigarette and throw up.  I just need to keep crudites and fruit around so I don't get shaky and eat too quickly.  I'm fucking with the level of sugar in my blood and it is making me somewhat cranky.  So...after having said all that, I decided to write this post so as to not run to the bathroom.  I don't want Lisa on my back and I know she reads all of these.  Is it "off the wagon" when one goes back to whatever vice one quit?  Or is it "on the wagon"?  Jesus, you'd think  I  of all people would know this but I'm trying to remember.  "The Red Dot" Seinfeld episode covered this -  I've got all nine seasons on CD,  in order   (thanks to the most wonderful Vicente), and since this is going to bug me until I figure it out, I will have to watch it as soon as I get home.  But for right now, consider me on the wagon.  From food.  If both places made me sick, it must be me.  (W - we can still have lunch tomorrow - picking up more Prylosec (sp?) on the way home tonight)  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Took me two hours to get ready today.  After the HM post last night, you might think I was curling each individual eyelash.  Not so.  I just didn't want to get ready.  I don't want to work today.  This is not a working Sunday where I'm feeling far behind or working on some project with an impending deadline.  This is a "one day this weekend, come into the office and..." working Sunday.  I am debating about packing up all the shit I have to go through and just taking it home so I can smoke, have a drink and do it in peace.  Besides, my office gives me the creeps when I'm there alone.  I swear I hear voices (different from the voices I often hear inside my head)...the office was once a daycare center for the property we are located at, and Banana Pillow said she always thought it was haunted by the ghosts of the children who used to attend daycare there.  I'm not really sure about that since we didn't kill the children or have a fire in which all inside were trapped and died some horrific death.  We just made them all go to another daycare center.  But I  do  hear voices when I'm there by myself.  I think for safety and sanity's sake, I would be better off working on the shit at home.  In my boxer shorts.  Visiting with Fabulous Dianne.  A good time was had by all last night, except possibly for V, who did not get a nap and who is stressed.  Dianne and Lisa (my two favorite babes) had a blast.  We got it all on video since V was there filming the band, even the rather silly and possibly frightening dance I made Dianne do with me.  I think our bar tab was about $120, so Vicente, I'll give you some cash later on this week when you get back from KC.  We drank entirely too much last night.  Or maybe that was just Dianne and me.  Heading out now, looking very unfashionable, to go grab my crap at work and go.  I'm just going to sing loudly to myself while I'm there so I don't notice the voices.  Too bad that doesn't work with the ones in my head.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Vicente came over to take a nap (or try to) before we leave to see Oliver's Army.  Since I have all of my girly things in my half bath adjacent to my bedroom, I started dragging it all to the full bath, which I only use to take baths.  Three trips later, I thought out loud, "Goddamn, I  am  high maintenance."  Three makeup cases of varying sizes, four different hair products (not to include shampoo - that stays in the full bath), four different kinds of moisturizers, and then I realize I left my Benetint in the other bathroom.  What is really amazing is that it only takes me about 35 minutes to get ready (my short hair helps).  Vicente wouldn't call me UHM (ultra high maintenance) about my appearance, just HM.  However, he claims I am OTC UHM when it comes to hydration and blood sugar issues.  Take our trip to Boston in May 2002.  We are running around like we normally do on trips and everywhere else, not really knowing where we are going or what we'll end up doing, just having an adventure.  However, given the fact that we were toe-up drunk the night before and ran out of bottled water in the mini bar (I learned my lesson about drinking tap water in that city), I was severely dehydrated by my standards.  We had to stop twice if not three times to get me something to drink.  I believe Vicente was about ready to toss me into the harbor like some British tea.  Guess I will awaken the sleeping V.  I still have to get dressed and decide on perfume.  He, on the other hand, will be ready in five minutes.  Damn.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I figure it has to be happy hour somewhere, so I poured myself a glass of wine.  Was SUPPOSED to go shopping with B, who bought a red truck this morning, but I guess he's out tooling around the Cliff in it.  [I think B wants to be like me.  Or else he wanted to put Ol' Red to shame with his shiny new truck.  Shame on you, B.  (When are you going to call?  I am  so  wanting to run up your AMEX, purchasing items I really don't need...come on, it'll be  fun .)]  This morning, before eggs and coffee at Owen's, I talked Vicente into recording an audblog for me (I really didn't have to talk him into it, he simply said "okay").  Feel like my ABs are boring (the reason why I have deleted most of them), so I decided to record all misbehavior at the coop (at least the non-incriminating misbehavior).  Which is what I am sure all of you want more of...drunken ramblings (at least the written ones don't sound slurred).  Then again, it may become the  most  fun.  I am trying to figure out what the hell the lyrics to "Other Side" by RHCPs mean.  Not that this is something I normally sit around and contemplate, but it's playing on mix I named in honor of Ms. Jackson and the nipple.  (Hour-long pause)  Sorry, got distracted by my art project.  I found a naked Scott Weiland pic of him playing the piano that  must  be on the door.  Vicente says I am obsessed.  He is one to talk.  (V - what about your arcade games?)  To be fair, I do have more historical evidence of my proclivity to become obsessed:  Chipie, finding absinthe in Paris, those DAK boots, tattoos and body piercings, my blog, "the door", the "Next Stop Wonderland" quest in Boston, pork pie hats, feather boa coats ( has  to be pink), burning unusual CD mixes, that lovely Irish cheddar we found at the now-defunct Marty's after that wine tasting class, chickens, rescuing dogs, Sparky, my new state of pesce vegetarianism (nothing with legs...ok, I cheat every now and then with sushi), Taco Cabana bean and cheese tacos, frozen pizzas, losing weight, my body fat percentage and discovering the best route to finding "God."  Oh, yeah, and cocktails and cigarettes.   C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      1) tolerates my drunk-dials  2) is the best "lover" I've ever had ("two pounds of glistening ham")  3) loves my dogs  4) thinks chickens are fabulous without a doubt, even the crazy ones  5) has this oh-so-cute way of kissing me, especially when he's horny  6) notices when I:  get my hair cut, change perfumes, wear a new outfit, buy new shoes, get my nails done  7) isn't afraid of his "feminine side"  8) will stand up to me and not take my bullshit  9) "steals" my dogs when he spends the night  10) calls me every a.m. and even when he's out of town, just to say hi to the Chicken  I honestly think I'm the luckiest fowl on the earth.  Not many chickens can call a mariachi band member their boyfriend.   C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I'm waiting on Vicente, the Fabulous Dianne, Uncle Fluffy (that would be Dale) and his GF, Candace, while Paddy Mac is watching "Twin Peaks" in the other room.  Had a semi-"fight" with an old "friend" and am not really feeling all that great about it.  Can't find my other krazy glue pen.  Long, weird day...another one.  So if I'm cranky, guests of the coop, shut up.  I just need something bad for me and a few glasses of wine.  Call Domino's - I have the rest covered.  Even though I'm pissy right now without the excuse of PMS (friends have started noting it in their calendars due to my overuse of the excuse), here are some good things, things I like, things that make me happy.  They're just not all "things":  - Sadie watching out the front window for me every evening when I pull in my driveway  - watching STP videos by myself on a Tuesday night  - reading something that really makes me think  - Lisa, Dianne, V, B, Sadie/Buzzy/Nico, Paddy when he has had a few too many, and the rest of my fabulous friends  - my Sparky shrine (which alternatively makes me sad)  - traveling with Vicente (who is the most fun on a trip, or anywhere else for that matter)  - new purse/shoes/outfit/coat/accessory  - discovering other blogs that are so "yes"  - writing in here  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I popped all my nails off at work today.  They were in need of a fresh start, so was I.  The woman next to me had glitter polish on the line where pink meets white, so I thought, "What the hell?" and then decided to go one further.  I had her do that to all of my nails except the right ring finger, where I wear the Claddagh ring V gave me with the heart facing me (shows that I am in a relationship and unavailable, for those of you unfamiliar with the Irish ring and its legends).  On this nail, I had the nail tech paint a red "D" for Vicente, which she outlined in glitter polish.  Yeah, I know it's pretty ghetto, but flashy and bright are synonymous with the Chicken.  Afterwards, I drove right down the shopping strip to the specialty beer and wine shop, Hops and Grapes.  While I was purchasing my three bottles of "inexpensive" (aka cheap) sparkling wine, one of the owners, who was ringing me up, told me, "I like your nails."  (Side note:  every single time I go in this place, one of the guys who works there compliments something I'm wearing or carrying...boots, purse, coat)  I thanked him but he wasn't finished.  He had these intense eyes that seemed to be able to look right into your head, to know what you were thinking by staring at you.  Mr. Eyes said, "You can tell a lot about a person by their nails."  I responded with, "Really?"  He replied, "Think about it.  These are two parts of your body you use more than anything."  (He hasn't spent an evening listening to me go on and on, but I decided against any sarcasm.)  So I  had  to ask, "What can you tell about me?"  "If someone's nails are clean and well manicured, then the rest of their body is clean, too."  I had absolutely nothing to say in response (unusual for me).  Good thing he didn't offer to carry the wine out to my truck for me.  It's like a mobile trash can.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      First, I didn't behave myself last night.  Long story.  Hope I didn't really fuck up.  B says not to worry but he knows I will.  That's it for me - no more happy hours during the week.  Second, I changed contacts this morning.  They haven't yet learned the curvation of my eyes.  Third, I waited too long to eat my other taco this morning, and it was stiff when I tried to bite into it.  Fourth, the transition party I'm attending for Vicente's work tonight will be at a comedy club.  That's great, except that one of the performers is my first husband's brother.  Fifth, I'm hungry, but I'm working through lunch so I can leave at a decent time to go meet V and get humiliated by my ex-brother-in-law.  Finally, I really don't want to be here right now.  I would  really  like to be in Paris.  Am I too old to run away from home?  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I'm working on the door again.  Tried all kinds of glues...now I'm on the krazy glue pen (I absolutely hate it when companies think spelling "crazy" with a "k" is cute).  Not only are my sinuses (still sick) bothering me from the smell, I'm also having a difficult time avoiding gluing my fingers together.  Look at Chicken, trying to be all "artsy" when I still, at 35, can't keep within the lines while coloring with my neice.  (Honestly, I think outside the lines is better, but that's the reason I didn't pass Art in junior high.)  I have to say, the door is looking fabulous.  It's also a very easy way for the layperson to tell that my mind is going in 357 different directions at once, and that I'm not all that normal.  (Thank God.)  If I had a therapist (okay, godammit, I  know  I need one! enough already), I wouldn't show them the door.  It is a little too spastic.  But it's cute.  Ha, like my Happy Bunny sticker, "cute but psycho.  things even out."  Isn't that true?  It's all yin and yang, a dichotomy.  By the way, I received a nice compliment on this blog from someone I was slightly worried about visiting the site.  MB, if you read again, thanks.  Your words meant a lot.  (And I'm curious to know your thoughts on my "Four Agreements" post.)  I thought of looking back over the totally fucked-up year 2003 to determine what I've learned, what I've lost, what I've gained, what doesn't really fucking matter anymore and what really weird things happened to me.  This is what I came up with:   What I've Learned   Love doesn't end when the person/dog you love dies - it grows stronger, in fact, and it truly becomes a part of you, a tattoo on your soul  Money doesn't mean shit unless you haven't got any, or not enough - then most people obsess over it - learn to see it as a means to an end  Don't do anything permanent to your body unless you are comfortable showing it when you are 80 years old (obviously, I have no qualms with this one!)  Love isn't saying, "I love you" - love is driving to north Dallas to buy fish, cutting articles out of the paper that you know would interest me, coming over and just falling asleep with me rubbing your back, staying up all night with me when I am vomiting vital organs, or sending me cute emails just to rile me up  What we are put on earth for is usually undiscovered by us - those few of us who know, we  really  live  Most people you will encounter don't know what the fuck they are doing or talking about - let it lie; IQ tests are a thing of the past, and you know you're smarter anyway  Looking into the eyes of a dog you love, one who depends upon you, and seeing the unconditional love coming back to you - well, that's the closest to God I've ever come   What I've Lost   My best friend ever (Sparky)  A car (but who gives a fuck?)  A lot of $$$ on vet bills (again, who gives a fuck?)  My mind (too late, I found it again!)  Impatience, intolerance and ambiguity   What I've Gained   Strength (I didn't get here on my own - thank you, friends, for standing by me from June until December)  A renewed sense of self-confidence and self-esteem (fuck YOU if you don't like me)  Acting abilities (always there, never called upon, found out I'm really  good )  Being less judgmental (who the hell am I to question you or anyone else?)  A new friend from far away - one who made me feel nostalgic for the Bren I once was, and happy to be the Bren I am now  An intolerance to hard liquor (that's another post altogether)  An appreciation for what I have, without that gnawing longing for what I want  Love - for others, but most importantly, for myself   What Doesn't Really Fucking Matter Anymore   My dress size (although I'm down to a six, I'm working on the eating disorder thing, I promise!)  Money  Any inkling of responsibility for those things that occur outside my direction   Weird Things That Have Happened To Me:   Myself and one of my best friends saw Sparky  twice  in my home after he died  I realized I really  do  want a relationship after all (and found out so did Vicente)  Everything I knew or learned before is 90% useless because the world is changing so fast  My mother and father will eventually die - what the hell will I do then?  I won't be this cute forever  I don't believe in "one true love'  All it takes is one phone call to change your life...seriously  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      This post is dedicated to Dana, one drunk-ass chick, and her husband, Morris, who I think is pretty damn cool...  Okay, so I'm trying to be nicer, not so hateful, with those people I don't really care for.  Let's take "Meredith" for an example.  Meredith is blunt, rough around the edges.  She could stand to go to charm school.  Before, when dealing with Ms. M, I would be just as blunt, kind of snippy, and stand my ground.  Dana says that's why we didn't get along.  I would come back with, "I don't like her, I don't care if we get along."  Then, tonight, I did that old Indian saying of "walking a mile in someone else's shoes" and I thought to myself, I have no fucking idea what Meredith has been through.  Her world and mine are not the same, so how dare I judge her or make assumptions that she means something she might not mean?  So I called her, left a sweet message for her.  I felt really good about that.  Dana said, "Oh, now you'll be able to sleep easier knowing that you made that effort."  I said, "Not really.  I'm feeling so good about myself, I probably won't be able to go to sleep."  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      My boyfriend, the infamous Vicente, called to help with yet another Excel problem I was having.  The man is brilliant!  (I found out he actually reads these posts, so I must be nice.  He really   is   intelligent, though.  And I'm not saying that just because I'm sleeping with him.)  After "repairing" my spreadsheet, V asks me about Candyboots.  He talks about the Weight Watchers recipe cards from the 70s.  I tell him, "I already know about them...I've been a fan of Poundy (Wendy) for a long time."  Ah, but V had me there.  Ms. Wendy's gone and added a couple links I did not know about.  So we're reading about these nauseating, anorexia-inducing cookbooks and laughing our asses off.  Really, you should check these out.  I would go to Poundy, then to Candyboots, then to Weight Watchers cards...at the bottom, you should see two links that are well worth the time I spent reading them.  I also found new pictures for my chicken collage.  Ran out of glue, though.  BIG kiss to Candace, who not only came through with the Happy Bunny sticker, "cute but psycho...things even out," but also provided me with "you suck big time" - this will get a special place on my door.  Didn't work tonight after all (at least, not on work-work).  Seems my computer nerd brother could not get a connection to my office's network...the VPN was set up correctly, but it kept bouncing me back.  So I think I'll have a glass of wine and call Dana back instead.  Is "American Idol" over yet?  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Progress Report:  I now have 16 items on my door collage.  Actually, 17 if you count the Drake's Coffee Cake label, which is in two parts.  There are several stickers, a magazine ad I've had on my fridge for years, a postcard from Vicente of the famous photo, "A Day In Harlem," four wine labels (imagine that!), a photo of the Spark-man when he was four months old (and still Min Pin thin).  Oh, and a picture of POE doing a high kick with the caption, "You can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being."  If I sell the house, the door goes with me.  Actually, that in itself will probably be a selling point.  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Much to the chagrin of (I'm sure) several people, I found my voice again...after several hours of feeling like shit.  I don't think my boss was very happy with me.  And our server was down (actually, the hub died, the server is alive and well, but without the hub, we were useless).  I think I am going to try a humidifier tonight.  If we didn't have to keep going down to the Hill Country for corporate retreats, if they could have it, say, HERE, or in San Antonio, I wouldn't get sick.  I'm allergic to the Hill Country, which is unfortunate because it's a great place, one of the best places in Texas.  There's just some damned weed or tree or pollen there that makes me sick every time I visit.  I'm overdosing on Vicks Vapor Rub...  C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      A potential vendor stopped by today to see me.  What is really strange is that (1) he's a high school buddy of my older brother, (2) he once had a party, years ago, at which I picked up a guy 11 years younger than me (I really wanted the boy's cousin, though) and (c) I was talking about him at lunch today (Blue Fish with Mary/Lisa and Vicente, mmmmm).  Hello, Mrs. Robinson.  I think the boy (not the vendor) proposed or something afterwards.   Scary.   This got me thinking about my older brother and his infamous departure from DHC.  For the 1983 senior prank, the Naughty Nine decided to do something other seniors before them had yet to think of and/or have the balls to do.  They built a three-foot dick out of cement (using basketballs for the gonads, good God) and placed it in the West Campus Commons Area.   And they got caught.   My brother's high school diploma has a slightly different graduation date than his fellow seniors (as did the other Naughty Eight).  He was a legacy and I hated that then (I love it now).  When I was 29 (at the afore-mentioned party, hob-nobbing with 18 year-olds), a certain pre-20-something guy I knew said, "Oh my  GOD , that was  your  brother?"  The infamy lives on, even now.  All I did in high school was get detention for being late to class and then I bottomed out my Aries K car while driving drunk (I did not drink again for four years).  God, how  proud  my parents must have been that summer:  one delinquent doing "time," working on the high school grounds in order to graduate, and their lovely, psychotic ninth-grade daughter, attending summer school in order to make it to the tenth grade.  And in counseling, for her depressive episodes (thank God for Prozac, right?)  [Editor's note:  I whizzed through the World History book, three inches thick, 42 chapters, in two weeks,  and  made a  92  for the year, so  sod off!  mother fuckers!]  Segue to this, on an  entirely  different note:  We are pulling most  hilarious  prank on E tomorrow.  I've already set wheels in motion (LOVE April Fools' Day).  HP on E is underway...and I'm feeling slightly guilty, as E is a pretty good guy.  Yes, delicious young man next door, Bun.  But he has it coming to him as he roped me into previous practical joke that turned out weird.  (I'm sorry, Belinda)  By the way, DFW bloggers, I colored my hair AGAIN and it's like straw.  Straw Head.  Just call me that from now on out, not NG.  It looks good, just don't touch it for a while.  My Buzzy has a licking fixation.  I cannot stay still anywhere without him licking my calves.  That is just disgusting.  I smell like nasty dog breath from the knees down.  Not that  I  think it is nasty (I  love  Buzzy and all my dogs), it's just that if anyone else went sniffing down there, they might wonder what I've been stomping through.  Of course, no one but V should be sniffing anywhere, right?  And I think he's accustomed to Buzzy's shit breath by now.  He should be - Buzzy LOVES to lick Vicente.  And anyone else who ventures into the Coop.  Another phone call from Vicente.  He's working oh-so-hard to get this going.  I keep deleting positive (and negative) posts about V, but he's the best.  Honestly, I cannot imagine what my life would have been like the past four years without V.  That's probably the best "love song" I can sing him.  Goddamn.  Thank you for sending him my way...

      Sorry, but it's been too long since I mentioned things associated with shit, so I had to throw that in.  It's 10:27 p.m. CST as I begin this post.  My night has been like this:  Left work around 6:15.  I've actually started  enjoying  working late here lately.  Sometimes I forget the time.  Oh bliss of doing job not very well suited to me.  Still, my boss is cool and I'm pretty much left to my own devices.  And she did not mention hickey once.  I don't think she saw it, she was pretty stressed today.  Went to Tom Thumb and bought wine, Orajel, Sensodyne and ingredients for my Trailer Park Bean Casserole, the one that always makes me throw up afterwards (think it's the combo of ketchup and chili powder).  Came home, ate the godforsaken mess of crap, got sick, watched "The Secret Lives of Dentists" (odd movie, but pretty good), called Vicente and we bakked for a while, then ran a bubble bath and sat down here.  In reference to a comment, yes, Bun, that was E - the "boy next door."  Ha!  On the opposite end of the spectrum, more like it.  He's "mad" at me because I came in with this ridiculous, high-school  thing  on my neck?  Laughable.  Around the time E popped out, I was losing my virginity.  So there.  Leave it alone, I'm old enough to have given birth to you.  Besides, I like older guys these days.  Believe it or not, more staying power and  much  better in bed.  I found this rather interesting bruise under and on my left tit.  Not from V, I think I pulled something from lifting those weights too much.  And probably in the wrong way.  I bruise far too easily, always have.  And, like Ninsi, I explore and ponder my bruises.  The leg bruises, mid-thigh and down, are easily explainable.  Dogs.  Desks.  Drawers.  I'm a fucking klutz.  And my dogs like to use my thighs for a trampoline.  The rest?  Well, hell, I'm sure they're from some alcohol/disco-related incident.  I'm listening to the last CD mix I made before Sparky died last June.  God, I was ANGRY.  I must have hated work, life, EVERYTHING then.  I don't really remember Father's Day, 2003 on, until late October, when I decided it was either Prozac or Terrell, and the only promising thing about Terrell is that damned outlet mall.  It seems I liked Todd Rundgren a LOT last June.  Okay, it's 10:39 now (posting time because I took time stamps off my blog, so I could post at work and not get caught).  Vicente was in a "zone" earlier and we sat for around five minutes just "hmmm"ing each other:  Me:  Hmmm V:  Hmm. Me:  Hmm  Hmm V: Hm Me:  (Silence) V:  Fine, if you don't want to talk to me... Me:  No, it's just that you're not saying anything... V:  Hmmm Me:  Hmmm V:  Let me call you back later.  FASCINATING conversation, let me tell you.  Must be an off night.  This is a very sad tale of a 36 year-old "girl" who is older in body than she should be:  I have one of those rubber hot water bottles old people use; my parents don't. It's Orajel in one room, maximum strength Theragesic in another. Sat for too long in one position on den floor, watching Dentist movie.  Tried to get up and couldn't put pressure on my right leg at first.  However...  I still get carded for liquor AND cigarettes. Someone told me they thought I was twenty-seven the other day. A while back, while out with a friend, someone asked her if I was her daughter...  Young on the outside, 80 years old and carrying around a hot water bottle and Geritol on the inside.

      Since no one is speaking to Ninsi, I decided to drop everything I was doing (eating leftovers from last night) and make N a list of "Things To Do Before I Leave This Hell-Hole":  * Expose the secret the last day...I'm dying to know what it is * Rearrange the office of someone you don't care for * Switch caffeinated coffee with decaf * Go change the chair heights on all the chairs in the office * Download porn onto your boss' computer while he's at lunch * Begin collecting office supplies * If you have an office kitchen, and someone puts their lunch in the refrigerator, eat it before they can * Send a hate email from someone else's computer to your boss * Stick out your tongue at passers by  If this list isn't long enough, I can come up with a  LOT  more things to keep you occupied, Ninsi.

      That's what it feels like, at least.  I woke up at four.  You think  human  babies are bad?  They outgrow this shit.  So of course, remainder of the morning is only peppered with sleep.  Doesn't help that Vicente is here, looking all sleepy and cute.  Also doesn't help that I have all these tags on the babies, including little sterling silver St. Francis medals.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  Argh.  At some time before seven, I fall back to sleep.  Now I'm running late.  Well, not really late, ON TIME for me, late for the rest of the world.  I still feel intoxicated from last night.  V's off in a flash, looking very dapper in one of the suits I helped him pick out.  I'm looking like death warmed over, still in my VS pajamas, smoking a cigarette and drinking a Coke.  It's the real thing, baby.  And it's downright scary.

      I can't believe I stayed up as late as I did.  No one, NO ONE in the house was awake besides me.  It felt kinda like it did when I was ten and had been sick and had been sleeping all day.  My mom gave me some Nyquil and everyone else sacked out.  Not me, Nyquil makes me hyper.  So I'm up late, watching the shows my parents won't let me watch.  Stretched out in my pajamas on the floor in front of the television.  Sneaking a glance around the corner every now and then, just to make sure they're all still asleep.

      Yeah?  Well, neither do my mom and dad.  So there!  FABULOUS evening.  Vicente came over bearing gifts in the form of hummus, five types of beautiful cheeses, capers drowned in balsamic vinegar, some kind of water crackers I've never encountered before, two bottles of wine and some over-sized garlic croutons.  Oh, and two fine looking green apples with a fancy name.  I kept wanting to play with the double creme cheese; V kept wanting to play with me.  I now have a hickey the size of Fort Hood on my neck.  Attractive.  Can't wait for work tomorrow.  Am I fifteen or what?  (Is HE fifteen or what?)  Vicente is very tired from ten days spent skiing with the kiddo.  I'd be a terrible parent:  "Go skiing, hon, break a leg.  I'm staying here at the lodge."  Okay, so not really.  I'm thinking of sneaking into the other room, while V is fast asleep, and stealing way cute picture of him on skis.  Sorry, paused there to grab afore-mentioned photo.  Do you think he'll notice?  And if so, why the hell isn't he offering it to me first?  Put V right to sleep by watching fucking "Donnie Darko" for like the 800th time.  Please forgive me, blogosphere.  I'm wretchedly attracted to Jake Gyllenhaal.  I'm sure it could be described as a reverse Oedipus complex or something (keep your kids away from  her !) but what the hell.  I also like heroin addicts who ruin their careers, a victim to smack.  Bunny, I still think we ought to consider writing the  un authorized bio of Scottie.  He's in rehab now, who's to stop us?  I just decided I will make world's longest post and talk about nothing for at least five hours.  Actually, this  is  something.  I just BUTCHERED my fucking hair.  Okay, it's not  that  bad.  So I started trimming, then things seemed uneven, then I decided hair behind the ears meant no hair in front of the ears at all, then I started pointillating snipping (is pointillating a word?).  Then all hell broke loose and I thought, better no "sideburns" than really shitty ones.  I really need a chaperone when Vicente brings me two bottles of really good white wine.  Next week, I'll end up BALD.  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Now V's giving me shit about the lunging incident.  He's on his way to Central Market for hummus and cheese but he's only bringing one bottle of wine because he "knows how (I) get."  Too flirty?  Not me.  Too loud?  Well, of course.  Too sleepy?  I'll probably be out before he is.  Too NG-ish?  Hell, he's the one who supposedly coined the phrase (he did not, I did).  I think two weeks of not having me around to ruffle feathers and get all riled up has gotten to him.  So he's picking on my double time.  And no, Vicente, I am not taking claim for fame for coining "Neighbots."  That was your jewel, V.  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Got to talk to Vicente on his way into work this morning, which felt  normal  again.  I really did miss him this month.  Of course, V will do just about anything to ruffle my feathers, so he sided with the goose about two unrelated incidents, the goose incident being last May at Tyler State Park.  This weather is calling to me, so I've suggested a mini road trip to an area park for hiking this Saturday.  No overnight camping shit, I don't deal well with bugs, wasps and geese (obviously, since one chased me through the park, honking and snapping at my ass).  Plus, I set off the truck's alarm at 5:00 a.m. after a night I swear could be compared to the Blair Witch Project.  Vicente thought it was funny to put up sticks in little teepee like bunches out on the trail later.  I didn't think not to wear perfume, hairspray and makeup.  Hell, I haven't been camping since before I ever started wearing all of the above.  Inevitably, a swarm of bees (okay, only one wasp) attacked me, causing me to flail my arms about in a wild manner and spill my vodka.  All over myself.  Vicente always brings along "refreshments" when we go on these road trips.  His remained unspilled as he sat and laughed his ass off at me.  Oh, then there was the tick on my back.  That's another story altogether.  Too much going on at work today to be distracted with this, so I thought I'd post while everyone was in a meeting except me.  When it rains around here, it pours.  This makes my boss in not-so-good a mood.  I'm just going to OD on caffeine and smoke way too many cigarettes.  Shit, seven hours to go.  Damn.  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      What a fucked up weekend.  I'm so glad Vicente is coming home tomorrow.  I'm not glad that his flight arrives at five a.m. but after two weeks of no V, I'm willing to lose a little sleep over it.  He called from downtown Sacramento where it is 70 degrees.  V sounded tired and our conversation got off to a slow start but, as always, we picked up speed after I finished eating a piece of PBJ toast and had my mouth empty enough to speak in an understandable fashion.  Vicente joined a gym and is talking of getting into working out on a regular basis again.  It's too bad he lives in Las Colinas and I'm down in the Ville or we could work out together.  We discussed what's happened this past week.  Vicente sounded very sleepy and his voice made me yawn a few times.  Still don't think I'll get to sleep, though.  Pulled a NG again and deleted several posts, including one about Oompah Loompahs that really just needed to go away.  BUSY week ahead, with V back and the Prince concert this coming Friday night.  Tuesday and Thursday nights will be work out nights with Fab D, who is now over the Ass Illness that was going around (thank God I haven't gotten it).  Seems it's  always  something about bowel movements in here, sorry.  Other nights this week will include: Monday night, catching up with Vicente; Wednesday night, working on project; Friday night - PRINCE!  I still cannot believe Mark Pittman is going to see Prince.  Really enjoyed reading Who Hymn's account of this weekend's food activities.  Really did NOT enjoy hearing about Bunny's horrible weekend.  Wish there was something I could say or do.  Unlike WH, my weekend food activities were downright depressing.  How much frozen pizza can one person eat?  Even though I only end up eating half the Tony's individual deep dish cheese pizza, I still think my thighs are crying out, "No mas, no mas!  Donde esta frijoles y queso tacos?"  Like that's any more glamorous or exotic.  But better for me, since this weekend was pretty much a cheese fest anyway.  Might as well get some beans in with the mix.  Guess that'll be bfast tomorrow, as I have nothing I want to fix here and there's no milk for Special K.  While taking the third of four baths I took today, I pondered something:  What Do Friends Do/Don't Do To Each Other?  This is what I came up with, all pruned out and relaxed in the hot waters of my bathtub:  1) They never judge each other, or at least try to keep it to a minimum since that is sometimes impossible 2) They don't borrow money, or if they do, they pay it back quickly 3) They don't borrow clothes/shoes/purses/accessories/anything and then fail to give it back or return it in worse shape than you gave it to them 4) They don't take advantage of you when you're drunk, even if you are putting yourself in the position to be taken advantage of - friends look out for you,  no matter what  5) They don't steal your boyfriends or girlfriends 6) They tell you that you look pretty when you need to hear it the most, even if you don't 7) They call you when you're going through a bad time and after you get off the phone, you realized they made sure the phone call was all about you and your troubles, or trying to get your mind off of them, or trying to cheer you up 8) They give you funny nicknames that make no sense to other people, but between the two of you, they're hilarious (right Mary?) 9) They encourage and stand behind you - maybe not your choice or decision, maybe they don't believe in that - but they do believe in you 10) They love you even when you're wrong  Revision to this since V called at the end of this, while I was taking that fourth bath.  He's taking a cab home and will come by tomorrow night.  Promised me a delightful evening.  I'll just be glad to get to sleep next to him again.

      Smitty is much nicer than I am.  Thus Smitty gets all involved in area gangsta's life, and I'm thinking I'm missing out on a lot, not helping people who call me but who are wanting to speak to someone else.  One night, Paddy Mac, Double D and I were standing around the kitchen, drinking.  Imagine that.  In the course of two hours, someone from the 713 area code kept calling and asking for me 16 times.  I'm sure it was one of many people who want my money (no, you can't have it) but I wasn't in the mood to explain the many different reasons I was not paying them that particular month.  Mainly because I spent it all on makeup and shoes, but that's another story.  I kept having PM and DD answer the phone.  The seven times 713-person called and actually got to speak to someone, they were told:  1) She's on vacation in Nepal for three months 2) She's dead 3) She's out shopping 4) She doesn't ever want you to call her again, bitch 5) Stop fucking calling here! 6) She's just left to max out her new credit card 7) Bueno?  The Espanol route took care of it.  Who would have known that 713-person had an aversion to Spanish?  I need someone to tell me how to say, "Hey, leave a message" so that I don't have to deal with solicitors and bill collectors via voice mail, either.  Hell, I took Spanish in college and should remember, but I don't remember much of anything anymore.  (No, fellow smartasses, it's not the alcohol, although that doesn't help...it's the Prozac).  Yes, for those of you just now tuning in, I am on medication.  Believe me, you don't want me off it.  Otherwise I'd be wearing black, listening to Nirvana and eyeing my mother's sleeping pills.  And writing really bad poetry.  I give major credit to Princette for telling her son about sex early.  When I was nine, I learned about it.  From my mom.  After seeing my in-heat dog grinding away on a basketball.  She told me the basics and asked me if I had any questions.  My only one:  "How do giraffes manage that?"  I should have asked more questions, as I told the entire neighborhood that my mom told me the man puts his weenie (I think that was the word she actually used) in the woman's butt, and that, my friends, is how babies are made.  I'm sure that went over really well at the next block party.  What I do not understand, Princette, is why you had him tell me?  I know how to have sex.  P's a smart woman, though.  She didn't leave out the most important part.  Chance is gonna be pretty popular with the girls.  His last remark?  "Oh, yeah, and don't forget the foreplay."  Many other mothers would do us all a favor if they were that open with their young men.  My mother is an excellent cook.  This is terrible since she (a) lives down the road from me and (b) has started making vegetarian-friendly meals.  If I had to describe how I eat, I'd compare myself to Buzzy, who doesn't ever really chew his food, he just inhales.  NG herself just inhaled way too much salad and carrots and broccoli and potatoes.  On to more unpleasant topics, is it possible to have too much sleep in one day?  The 12 hours I slept on Saturday have really fucked with my internal clock.  I'm ready to go out dancing and it's only 3:45 on a Sunday afternoon.  By the way, whoever broke my cute new pink lighter can suck my ass because I only had it for two days.  Actually, I think it was me who broke the damned thing.  Sometime after Dianne and I were sitting on my dirty floor looking at cigarette butts in an ashtray.  And then I wonder where all the vodka went.  It's more psycho/angry this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Okay, my apologies to the poker players last night.  But this time, I had good reason for not showing up, as opposed to other times, when I'm just being Flake NG.  Double D has an inflamed liver.  Jesus.  Fuck.  Damn.  If  his  liver is inflamed,  mine  must be the size of a NFL regulation pigskin by now.  I couldn't leave.  DD was visibly upset.  And Bunny, I even had on cute new outfit and glitter, I was ready to GO.  But I've been friends with DD for 22 years.  I couldn't go.  I'm sorry, Bunny, I know I cajoled you earlier in the evening and I should have called but last night was a mess.  We're hoping it's not Hepatitis.  It's better if it is alcohol-induced and he can just dry out.  I'm OD'ing on Milk Thistle and worrying about the state of my own internal organs now.  I'm dropping his name in my prayer vase and rubbing the Buddha's belly and crossing my St. Francis medal if that will help.  Dreams last night consisted of:  kidney transplants, images of Sean Penn and Naomi Watts, my mom making me try liver and onions as a child and dogs being locked up in rooms for days.  I've totally lost my appetite, realizing the reality of my mortality probably seriously for the first time.  I'm not prepared to deal with middle-age issues.  This has totally freaked me out.  Keep DD in your thoughts.  He's a great guy.  And one of my best friends.  Damn.  It's not more fun this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      My momma really didn't mean to shut me inside our room.  She is the best momma in the world.  I am not happy about her going to see Oliver's Army and the poker party, though.  I'd rather she stay home and let me lick the bottom of her feet all night.  Love and licks, Buzzy  It's more  tongue  this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Spent two hours shopping tax credit properties this morning, which I actually really enjoyed, and then more research related to that, then discovered I ran out of cigs, NOT a good thing at all, so I ran to a convenience store, conveniently located far enough away that I could smoke one on the way back, and while I was buying SF Red Bulls and cigs, I see the cutest lighter (will have to show you all tonight, I love this lighter, and yes, I get excited over meaningless things), and the lady behind the counter, she was really pleasant (unusual in retail these days) so I went back in and bought her a purple one, which she thanked me profusely for, and I only did it because she said she didn't make enough to spend $4 on a lighter because she worked for evil fascist convenience store where they don't pay well, so that was my good deed to offset inadvertently shutting Buzzy in my room this morning (luckily he was discovered), and then while driving back, I realized that even if I  did  want to play poker, I cannot, because I am broke and would rather spend my last few $$$ on booze, not gambling, and I also realized that not only should I not have bought one cute new lighter, what the hell was I doing buying two?

      This is a Tipsy Blog.  There is quite a difference.  Call from FHB, whom I just adore, she's so cute, and I made her promise not to divulge said tipsiness, although I am doing so right now.  I'm celebrating.  So sue me.  Paddy Mac is watching V's Seinfeld collection (V's a genius with the Tivo) and I'm thinking I really need to pluck my eyebrows.  Okay, here is where I get all sentimental and hokey and shit...BUT...  * FHB is by far the coolest chick I've met in a long time  * Ninsi looks cute (way cute) with the new hair color  * Princette is my fave for hooking me up with contact for business  * My older brother is fucking king for designing something for me earlier  * PM rocks because, well, because he's PM  * Get better M/L and D - no more of this illness bullshit  * Special thanks to V, who has worked all week on my project...I owe you a blowjob...

      ...has just exploded.  Don't worry, they're only superficial burns.  Okay, we all know Chicken/NG is not that "worldly" in the sense that she eschews current events for fear of becoming even more depressed.  Lately, C/NG has become more sensitive to the need of knowing what the fuck is going on.  So she gets the DMN every day (hey! I've been  reading  it!) and is beginning to rely upon it, not People Magazine, for current events (People is more fun, whatever).  I see that Gwenyth (however the fuck you spell her name) and Chris Martin recently jumped off the cliff with the rest of the lemmings and tied the knot.  And she's fucking  pregnant ?  I myself have never understood the call to maternity, but then, as we have established before,  I am not normal .  I am siding with Bunny - I refuse to live to be old enough to need Medicaid.  People the age of my parents are going to suck us dry and, being the Democrat I am (deep down, sorry Mom and Dad), I was fully intending on living my life out at the expense of the government.  Now I'm going to have to actually THINK about planning for retirement.  Maybe I will just drop dead at 65 and it will all be solved.  But as for the rest of you close to my age, what the fuck?  I truly believe the "glory days" of retirement are dead.  I'll end up as a Wal-Mart greeter instead.  Fuck. Shit. Damn.

      Not that I have anything against it, per se.  I think it should be legalized, in fact.  I just couldn't do it myself, and I find Belle de Jour  much  more interesting when she writes about subjects that are not at all related to her job.  I've read it's a hoax anyway, but wonder why on earth someone would do that and not just write for a living.  Of course, why did anyone ever put up "All your bases are belong to us"?  People are strange.  Thank God.  I'd be bored if they (and I) weren't.  I'm leaving my opinion here for Zero:  why would you even  think  about eating Mexican food while in Maine?  Just a question I had to ask.  By the way, someday we should all go to La Calla Doce in the Cliff.  Their fish tacos are amazing, with a cute little Lincoln Log stack of jicama sitting along side it.  Just don't order the fish, though.  They arrive with their vacant squinty eyes staring up at you.  I can't eat anything that stares back at me.  Pause...dog fight in other room.  I walked next to the oven and stood...fight diverted.  Pisser and Bunny do not like it when I delete my posts.  Sorry girls, but I had to get rid of that one.  It was clearly psycho and, as wack as I am, I do not want a post that conveys that to the entire world.  Not yet.  Let me become famous and then I will blog, blog, blog away in a strange and erratic manner.  Of course, then I'll just be "eccentric."  And people will start emulating my hair.  God forbid.  I'm considering installing a wireless camera in my den.  It's been an idea of mine for a while, but I think Min Pin Cam would be amusing.  It's too bad that I cannot install remote speaker system as well, so when they start acting up, I boom in from out of nowhere, "Enough!"  Or just to say, "Sadie..." sort of softly to watch her freak out.  Buzzy is guarding me from her right now, by the way.  His growl is my favorite.  Speaking of Buzzy, the ass-sock incident turned out okay.  He's doing fine, no more 12" shits, thank you very much.  Special thank you to one who has not checked in on him.  Bowel movements tend to fascinate me, and inevitably, at least once a weekend, Fab D and I will discuss BMs.  I hate my initials, by the way.  So I always initial "BCM."  I went very ghetto tonight when I got my nails done.  Red tips with a white line.  Trashy, but I like it, I like it.  Then, wonder of wonders, I actually signed paperwork at gym!  Yea for me - found out the kickboxing and Pilates instructors are fabulous.  Cannot wait to punch someone.  (Wait, Ninsi, you guys don't actually kick each other, oops.)  A request for all of you in the blogosphere who are much more talented than I am (which would be all of you, except Princette, who is learning like NG is):  Desperately need someone to design a graphic for me.  Please email me if you are interested in helping out a psychotic Chicken.  I'll buy you drinks or something.  It's important.  Although social life is now officially sucking ASS, work life has improved exponentially.  Boss is behind exciting new project 100% and has thrown in contacts  and  attorney to help out.  Announcement later, but this time tomorrow night, I'll REALLY be celebrating (as if I wouldn't be otherwise).  Boycotting any sort of domestic duties tonight (hahahahaha,  tonight ?), including washing dishes.  By the way, it's slightly sad when your own mother is not as excited and supportive about new project as you are.  However, she does have my track record to go on, but at least fake it at first.  Side note to Pisser:  if that photo really was of you, shut  up  about being fat!  My non-boyfriend would love you.  He has this thing about redheads, which is why I was one for one long, terrible year.  Not everyone can pull that off.  My best friend can, you can, but I need to stick to "yellow hair," as Princette's son calls it.  I have just decided Buzzy's growl is not that cute, not when he's jumping and growling for my pizza.  Be quiet already - I didn't have any bread today at all and am going through major withdrawal.  It's more carbs this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      My apologies to the blogosphere.  I was in a very bad mood last night.  Should have gone to bed immediately after work, as was first plan.  Instead, vented and ranted and acted like an ass.  Even if I was by myself, it doesn't matter.  Meeting to reorganize NG went very well, unexpectedly.  However, I had this epiphany that I kept inside until Gilbey's let it out.  It doesn't help when I go day to day in limbo, though.  Still does not excuse rants from last night.  Pardon me.  It's more fun this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Way back, long ago, back before Sparky, and before Vicente, and before me being even  close  to who I am now, I once house-sat for the All American Gay Couple.  I kid you not - they were featured in Life Magazine.  They had these two beautiful but slightly off-balance dogs, one who barked and lunged at shadows on the wall.  I just loved them (the guys  and  the dogs).   Amazing  house in Kessler Park, a swanky section where the homes are just fabulous, plunked down in the midst of trees, right in the middle of Oak Cliff.  Throughout the house, photos were scattered of them with various politicians, celebrities, writers, eccentrics.  Very first time I ever saw a room painted red (and just guess which color I painted my bedroom?).  Just an incredible atmosphere.  I felt love and warmth in every room.  I was given carte blanche during my stay, was told that whatever I found in the refrigerator and liquor cabinet were MINE.  One might think I took advantage of that, but no, I felt guilty, like I was stealing, and only had three Bloody Marys the entire 10 days I stayed there.  Well, and a couple shots of vodka, okay?  While I house/dog-sat, I was supposed to water the grass every day.  And I did, every single evening.  Kinda thought it was  fun , this whole domestic thing.  (That wore thin after only one summer at the Chicken Coop, but whatever.)  I sat outside on their deck in this amazing backyard, all quiet and peaceful, watching the dogs run and swatting away bugs and chain-smoking cigarettes, since I could not smoke inside.  One night, about halfway through my stay while the boys were at P-town, the alarm went off.  Shit!  The dogs and I jumped up, I'm panicked, I'd rather be attacked in my sleep, right?  Not know when it's about to happen.  That sort of thing.  So I'm flipping switches off and on and running around.  Turns out to be a false alarm.  The three of us (me and two dogs) go back to bed.  I really don't sleep easily that night.  The next week seemed to be rather dry.  For all the watering I was doing, things were dying.  And why wasn't I having to dodge the sprinkler each morning?  Not a natural blonde, I had no excuse.  I'm a dumbass.  It seems I turned off sprinkler system when I frantically tried to take care of false alarm situation.  Needless to say, I was not invited to house/dog-sit again.  They did give me fantastic t-shirt from P-town and lovely "thank you" meal.  But they probably wanted to throttle me and snap my head like a chicken for the dead grass.  How was I to know?  I was an apartment dweller...  I often wondered what happened to them.  The dogs and the boys.  That week was weird, sort of not-real, living in someone else's house and being surrounded by photos of people you don't know.  The entire time, I felt as though I wasn't really anyone, just some warm body taking up space and feeding two dogs.  Except for when I sat out on their back deck, swatting away bugs, watching the dogs play, and chain-smoking my cigarettes.  I still smile involuntarily when I recall those September evenings.  It's more fun this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      As if the Buzzy Ass Issue wasn't enough to get me in a fabulous mood and set me off food for a few hours, ten o'clock rolls around and we get this frantic call from one of our properties.  "WE'RE ON FIRE!!!"  Subtlety would have been nice.  My boss is on a conference call, the District Manager is on vacation, so my assistant and I speed over in Ol' Red to gauge seriousness of alleged fire.  Alleged my ass.  Lost one whole unit and flooded another.  First time for me to see something like that up close (I'm sheltered, I grew up in the suburbs), so I'm hanging out, looking over the scene.  Two other DMs drive up to assist, ask, "Have you taken any photos?" and since frantic leasing agent doesn't have a camera, we offer to go buy some.  I'm back, 30 minutes later, snapping photos of the debris the DFD is chunking out the window.  I wanted a closer shot of one particular appliance, start walking by the building, well out of reach of chunked debris (or so I thought), and a whirling, smoldering piece of I-don't-know-the-fuck-what lands right behind me.  I decide to do the safe thing and walk to the office to find maintenance men.  Yeah, right.  I think I had three guys trailing me at one point.  It was too much for me.  Had to drink another SF Red Bull and breathe deeply (and cough, since lung capacity has deteriorated even more after this past weekend).  I prefer being stuck in front of a computer if THIS is the alternative.  There went two and a half hours of my day.  The rest of the day was, well, it was boring by comparison.  How could anything top what happened from 7 a.m. until 12 p.m.?  First, I get to pull a sock out of my dog's ass (gently, mind you, it's not something you just want to YANK) and clean up frenzied mess.  Then I get to work, barely get settled in, and leave to play Lois Lane or some shit.  Tomorrow, I have lovely three hour meeting with our executive coach.  Mind you, I adore her, anyone who met her would not be able to help themselves, she's just wonderful.  Lights up a room.  However, we are getting together, one-on-one, to get Non-Girlfriend organized.  Fuck.  I hate that word sometimes.  I think messy is severely underrated.  I'm actually  nervous , and I don't typically get nervous, not even in job interviews anymore.  (In fact, at one interview, I propped my foot up on the guy's desk.  And I received word on the way back to my office that I had the job if I wanted it, but did  I  like  them ?  Sometimes it helps to throw out a wrench or two.)  If you saw my office, you would be, too.  It's scary.  I don't know where the hell anything is.  And I wasn't always this way.  The older I get, the more distracted I become.  Is it possible this is early Alzheimer's?  MB says she is the same type of person, which is why she is teaching this old chicken new tricks.  Time for a fucking list that will bore everyone to tears (I thought PMS was  last  week???):  1) Eating - was eating a frozen pizza, imagine that - remember kids, starch is our  friend !  2) Drinking - a glass of wine (again, no surprise there)  3) Reading - I'm not reading anything at the present time - I do intend to start "What Your Dog Can Teach You About Living A Happy Life" (co-written by a local author) - I'm guessing that I won't find "Eating Socks" as one of the chapters, right Buzzy?  4) Thinking - Things could be worse, I could be Martha Stewart  5) Doing - Prying off two bad fingernails (don't worry, they had it coming)  It's more fun this way...Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      I was the butt of all alcoholic jokes this weekend, from Vicente to Double D to my father and older brother.  I sat at the dinner table yesterday, looked around, and the only person WITHOUT an alcoholic beverage was...me.  Oh, and my eight year-old niece.  Hypocrites.  Of course, I had cocktails with Dianne later...  My weekend was slow, not too much activity, mostly domestic duties and Dogopoly.  I apologize to the blogosphere in its entirety if I ended up talking to you on Saturday evening.  Whee, I was having lots of fun all by myself, talking to Princette about 1984 Fieros.  This weekend looks about the same...except for Pre-Prince Party at Princette's.  Vicente flies back in at 5 a.m. on Monday morning (I offered to do airport run, thinking it was 5 a.m. on Sunday and I could go back to sleep).  Maybe I will actually finish housecleaning this weekend.  Fiasco at the coop this morning:  Turns out Buzzy ate one of my trouser socks and I had to help him extricate it.  What a fucking mess.  Poor guy was terrified.  Called the vet - he'll be fine.  He just stinks to high heaven now and I didn't have time to do the bath thing this morning.  That'll be tonight.

      That's because their mothers would have slapped them silly if they dared to be rude to a stranger.  Americans seem to have forgotten the importance of manners, and actually seem to revel in rudeness.  It's getting worse by the generation, too.  "Oh, look, how  cute !  Timmy just bit his day care teacher.  Doesn't he have lovely teeth?  Gets it from my side of the family...Let's go, Timmy,  NOW , or we don't go to McDonald's on the way home."  Just one more reason why I choose not to procreate.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Listened to voicemail from Bunny and am concerned as to which traits I share with HN???  Waiting on Fab Dianne and wishing I had not chopped one side of bangs and not the other.  I'm lopsided now, or as Princette puts it, "I think the left one is leaking."  Considering chopping other side but think I need to be inebriated to do so.  Pulled a muscle lifting weights and am now having serious sharp pains in my chest.  NO, not smoking pains.  This feels more like torn muscle tissue crying out for help.  My chest is coated in Extra Strength Theragesic and I smell like an assisted-living home.  I'm bored and cannot start on new project until tomorrow.  Supposed to be talking over said project with Fab D but wonder now if she got lost at Super Target.  I have heard that can happen.  I've also heard that some people have gone in, never to return, and that there are mannequins that look frighteningly similar to their loved ones.  Fuck, ST doesn't even have mannequins.  That sounds like something I'd say to my eight year-old niece.  Bday wish, two weeks too late:  Trip to Hawaii with Vicente.  Will probably end up with Trip to New Orleans with Vicente and 12 other people.  I'll take it, though.  My thighs are not yet ready for Big H.

      Thanks to Mary/Lisa, I have decided we all need to go on a road trip to Shreveport.  Nothing better than drinking and watching other people lose their money, while feasting on a $15.99 all-you-can-eat buffet.  I say, let's leave on a Saturday afternoon, I'll convince Vicente to use some of his Marriott Miles, get two rooms with two beds each, we all can crash wherever or not even crash at all, gamble/drink/eat all night, mock other guests at casino and get thrown out for rowdiness.  It sounds great...and it's the two-year anniversary of our first trip to Mini Sin City, back when my hair was auburn and I weighed about 20 pounds more than I do now.  They won't recognize me, but V will have to go incognito, as he looks the same, which is The Most Cute.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Just finished marathon game of Dogopoly with my niece, who was supposed to help me clean my house.  We did this instead, which was much more fun.  I've never won at Monopoly before, so I take the Chicken-shit route of playing against an eight year-old.  And I kicked her ASS!  Ended up owning everything but three "properties" (in this case, dog breeds) and cashed out at $9,426.  She had about $30 left.  And yes, I  am  gloating.  In front of my niece.  I wanted to show her what the real world is like.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      I want a job where I can take off for four days to another state, WITHOUT asking for someone else's permission.  Princette, why did you tell your mom and dad to read my blog?  I'm still waiting for the guys in the white suits to take me away.  Maybe this will expedite things?  Dear Mr. and Mrs. Princette Parents,  I am not really this crazy.  Most of this is sarcasm.  Don't worry about the drunken comments, either.  At least I'm not drinking and driving.  And please, PLEASE do not tell my parents about this blog.  The last one I let them read, which is now long dead, my father told my mother he was worried about me having "serious mental problems."  (I really don't think that should have come as a surprise to him, but what the hell ever.)  Love and kisses, Chicken  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Interesting evening in the blogosphere.  Don't know what time I crashed but it seems others were up late, posting comments about barnyard animals being intoxicated and wanting to buy cars, etc.  I behaved myself, for the most part.  I just stayed home.  Vicente called yesterday afternoon.  He just needed to cool off, as Bunny predicted.  We had a long conversation about my project and stressed urgency on my part to make a move.  Going to call first thing, V, on Monday a.m., and get it rolling.  Will be needing volunteers, so email me if you are intrigued.

      Princette hit it  right on  with her most recent post about being a mother.  She needs to stop being so hard on herself.  My weekend looks like this, and it's oh-so-sad:   Today...   Going back to bed for a spell.  Then up and at 'em, cleaning my farking house that really really really needs it.  I hate housework.  However, I have lured young niece to my house (she thinks Aunt Bren is the most fabulous) and am putting her to work.  Maybe I should have had children...thinking the backyard needs mowing and wishing I had a nephew.  Seriously, my darling, beautiful niece will probably only follow me around and keep me company during dreaded housecleaning.  Which is all I really need.  Then I am going to get my nails done and have a pedicure.  It's sandal season again, and my toes need the TLC.  One big toe (I won't name which one, it kinda gets embarrassed about this) seems to have a problem with dry skin.  I hope they do not use, as FHB puts it, the illegal scraping device.  It always scares me:  Who the hell was here before me, and what the hell did their feet look like???  Afterwards, Fab D and I are going to the gym.  I still haven't signed paperwork but they debited my bank account, so all is well.  I will not do too much the first day.  Probably just walk and lift weights and (sigh) look at very fit men and women and ask the Lord Our Father, Why not ME?  "Because you are lazy, my child."  Is that one of the Seven Deadly Sins?  If yes, I am SO going to hell.  I suppose I will come back here to fantasy clean house and take a nap.  Fab D and I are supposed to be going out tonight, but where, I do not know.  Missed Oliver's Army last night...I don't think either one of us was really into getting out, and the Barley House has sub-par seating arrangements, so that added to our ambivalence.  Possibly sushi, but I have found I can only do that once a week these days, and I already did it on Friday.   Tomorrow...   Working from home, totally hating it.  Wish I were like Cynthia, who has the opportunity to not work and do what she loves, which is painting.  VERY envious of her.  However, feel like I'd be selling out if I didn't work and the man I am with did.  It is very difficult for me to let go of underlying feminist notions, and I don't really think that is such a bad thing.  What did Kurt say?  "Married...buried"?  I second that.  Making lunch for following day.  Boss is back in town and I will not have time to breathe, let alone eat.  Greek salad and some bean concoction.  Possibly will wake my ass up early enough on Monday to cook eggs so I can get some sort of protein that day.  Will break down and have cocktails in the afternoon.  And watch movies with twisted plots, which seem to be the only movies I like lately.   Side Notes:   Stopped work on the door, as 30% has reference to Vicente and since he isn't speaking to me at the moment, I do not know in which direction I should take remainder of the project, and wondering how the hell I remove permanent marker captions below pic of V and me in London.  FHB - do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT start smoking.  Please tell me your remark the other night was sarcastic.  Or in jest.  Although I have not been addicted for too long, it's very difficult to stop this madness.  Plus, I once knew a couple who were addicted to heroin.  They kicked that habit, but still smoke.  As Paddy Mac says, Nicotine is Satan.  He should know...smoked Camel UNFILTEREDS for eight years before quitting, cold turkey.  Another FHB - yes, my brother  is  that brilliant.  It's frightening, kind of like having Donnie Darko as a sibling.  Without the hallucinations and falling aircraft parts and scary bunny.  My entire family is pretty intelligent but PM is downright scary.  He doesn't show it all the time, only maybe 5% of the time.  As Vicente once said, PM is pretty cool, but every now and then, he just says something so 'out there' that you have to pause."  I don't give a shit about IQ scores (I think they're bullshit, and mine was good) but Paddy's was off the charts.  The Dr. that first treated his ADD said he wondered how the hell Paddy made it out of high school, let alone finished two degrees.  Had to take a quick break to go outside with the babies.  It's spring in Texas, my favorite time of the year.  I cannot walk outside without getting at least 15 buds in my hair.  My trees look beautiful and the dogs are frisky.  I think people get frisky as well.  I wonder if there are more babies born in December due to said friskiness?  I think I am posting now to keep from thinking about what is obviously on my mind.  Forgive me, as this is the longest I've spent with one person, and I need time to adjust.  I have absolutely nothing to say.  Therefore, it is time I went back to bed.

      Why the hell am I up at 7:15 on a Saturday morning?  Because the neighbor next door has his daughter visiting, who has about 20 dogs.  Okay, more like eight.  But it's still an excessive number.  Speaking of dogs...two bit me in the last three days.  Buzzy accidentally nipped my finger while lunging for a treat.  Then one of the two horses, aka yellow labs, my boss owns (who I've been feeding this week), lunged for my face to cover me with stinky, wet, yellow lab kisses.  I turned my head, he caught my eyebrow instead.  Now I have lovely red mark on my eyelid/eyebrow.  I guess it could have been worse.

      Nothing worse than a night full of weird dreams after which you wake up and wonder what the hell happened.  One of them went like this:  I am privy to an email conversation between Bunny and Who Hymn, in which Bunny writes, "NG certainly does use the word "fuck" a lot, doesn't she?" and WH replies, "Yes, and every time, I try to overwrite those words.  It just doesn't work."  I'm yelling, "But it's my favorite cuss word! I don't mean it in a bad way! I just like the way it sounds!"  They cannot hear me.  It's like they're in a bubble and I'm floating overhead.  Or they're dog dreams.  Which are sad, and much, much worse.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      (Haven't yet watched a movie.  Still on that second glass of wine.  Listening to the sound of my dogs running through the house, tags jingling and tails wagging.  Tap dancing on my wooden floors.)  God, I was in such a rotten mood earlier.  I wanted to scream for about ten minutes, kick a couple pillows and cry for an eternity.  Then, I remembered Sparky.  Like I could ever possibly forget?  I will always and forever think of this house as The House That Sparky Built.  Granted, it was around for 41 years before my Sparky was, it's still The House That Sparky Built.  I'll tell you why.  After my (oh my GOD!) SECOND divorce at the tender age of 27, I struck out on my own for the first time.  The years between 27 and 30 were rocky, scary, terrifying at times, but I managed to survive.  And enjoy it.  I hated the feeling of being "tied down."  So I did the wise thing and moved in with my newest boyfriend not even a year later.  Doomed is a word you can use.  JEB, it wasn't you, it wasn't me, it was the TIMING.  After that, FUCK RELATIONSHIPS, I said.  I had the best times and the worst times and often wondered when it would all slow down and I could B R E A T H E again.  Inhale, baby, because you're gonna need some oxygen:  December 1998 - Sparky was born; I was in sick relationship with K, who looked like The Hobbit (don't ask). March 1999 - I broke up with The Hobbit and needed something to nurture. April 1999 - Went to pick up the love of my life, my little man, that little shit! Sparky. January 2000 - Was almost certifiably suicidal; leaving Spark was the only thing that stopped me. February 2000 - Bought first home, mainly because I thought the idea of a backyard would be a GOOD thing. May 2000 - Meet Vicente/Move into FIRST HOME. December 2000 - Decide we are exclusive (me and Vicente, not me and my dog) January 2001 - Sparky comes close to losing his life to Addison's Disease - I spend astronomical amounts of money on his "cure" - only to find there is none, only a treatment; begin countdown to June 17, 2003 March 2001 - V comes as close as he ever did to telling me he loves me (if that's possible) August 2002 - Sparky is pre-diagnosed with Lymphoma, only to turn out to be a really bad infection Thanksgiving 2002 - "Rescued" Sadie, sister and playmate for Sparky - they love each other immediately! February 2003 - "Momma" comes close to talk of permanent brain damage from infection; Sparky sleeps with Momma non-stop for two week recovery period; Sparky doesn't care that Momma's neck is the size of a mutant football. April 2003 - More seizures, Jesus, will he  ever  get better??? May 2003 - Adopt Buzzy, who just seemed to be "right" for my home June 17, 2003 - Sparky lost life-long fight against weakened body, bad genes and shitty luck.  I would have given him one of  my  kidneys, had it fit.  I can survive a lot of things:  divorce (2), death (not that many, and I still have my parents), disappointment (who hasn't??), bankruptcy, illness, chronic pain, loss that is unmitigated to those of us who lead more blessed lives.  The one thing that threw a wrench in all of it, all the strength, all the toughness, all the wisdom and cliches and yeah-I-know-it's-all-for-the-best is this:  what the hell do you do when you lose your soulmate?  Be it a dog, a boy, your son, your mom, a friend, some words, a smile, true love...it hurts the same way for all of us.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Okay, it went down like this (God, I've  always  wanted to say that!)...  I didn't have that much Skyy, just a lot of diet Coke, probably saved my happy ass that the freakin' waitress was so slow.  However, the DC slid right through me and I kept getting up to go tinkle.  At one point, Princette and I got up together, but the fucking line to the "Ladies'" Room was backed up with slutty-looking little 20-something girls, all wearing outfits I wish I could fit my fat ass into.  I tell P, "Hey, let's just use the Mens' Room, since the line is much shorter..."  Sounded like a good idea at the time.  The guys all thought it was funny, except for the two at the urinal, especially when I walked up and asked if Princette and I could use those.  (I hear that's a boy no-no, sorry.)  We both go into the large, comfortable handicap pee pee stall, and I'm just about to squat when BAM! someone kicks the door open.  P is caught with her pants around her feet; I think I may have pissed myself.  All Princette remembers was, "Out and to the left!  Out and to the left!"  I high-tailed it out of there.  She stayed behind to chat with the cop.  ABOUT LAST NIGHT...  I agree with Zero...Phlome's entry takes the cake.  I just wish the tongue picture was gone.  Plus, you needed a wide-angle lens turned sideways to catch my chin in that photo with Zero.  (I think Zero should wear more pink...it's very becoming with his complexion.)  I like the Bunny photo, too.  She should wear boas every day.  It's so Bunny.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      He hates it when his momma is gone for too long.  In fact, they all do.  I have three sleepy Min Pins, waiting to sleep in a bed instead of on one of their couches.  I've been known to make guests get up and move if one of the little ones wanted to sit down.  Except for Vicente; they just pile on top of him.  Fun time tonight.  Stayed out way too late on a school night.  Will be paying for it in the a.m.  Wait, it is in the a.m., isn't it?

      I feel a lawsuit coming on.  However, I will be the bigger person and simply bitch about it here.  Zealots - Less Is More  What is it in some people's makeup that creates monsters out of good intentions?  Zealots of any kind are dangerous, and yes, Mel, I'm including you.  Keep your pumped-up-on-steroids beliefs to yourself.  Since when did we all have to believe the same things?  Just because you (zealot person out there) are insanely obsessed with saving the whales, does not mean that when I, person with a life and other commitments, want to back out of said whale-cause, I am going to hell for not committing my life, finances and sanity to your frappin cause.  And crucifying me in front of an entire state of VOLUNTEERS makes you look, well, it makes you look  insane .  Let it be.  Not everyone wants to be a martyr.  Carry that cross on your own.  And one special note for an extremely bitter person in the Plano area, whom I shall refer to as S (not short for "Satan," but could be), LEARN HOW TO READ.  My niece understood that email better than you did, idiot.  Get back on your hormone therapy, S, or take some Zoloft.  And by the way, IF I were having an incestous relationship with my brother, which I am NOT, I wouldn't be bragging about it to 30+ people.  I'd keep it quiet, like they do where you grew up.

      That's how long it took me to drive out to Ovilla, feed two HUGE Labs, get licked in the eye three times, lock up and alarm the house, and stop by Payless for cheap tennies for Official First Work Out In Two Years.  And I didn't stop for lunch.  So guess what I get to eat?  Carrots and pickles, the only thing I can find in the refrigerator besides hummus, which I had already for mid-morning snackola.

      Weird dreams all night.  And for the record, Roland, the dreams in which I'm dying are not the best I've ever had.  Talked to Paddy Mac for almost an hour (record) and we actually agreed with each other most of the time and did not fight.  Amazing.  Didn't finish Swimming Pool but will later tonight.  AFTER first official workout.  Fell asleep with the three little ones and dreamed of my demise all night.  Hope to God those dreams do not come to fruition.  Guess Bennigan's in Irving it is.  You will all see watered-down version of NG, as I do not drive when I've had something alcoholic to drink.  Will be secretary and record evening's events instead.

      1) Wish I had funny mouse chocolate story to tell.  Only "eating story" I have is that time when Sparky ate the video tape.  It wasn't funny at the time, but when I found out he was all right, and my vet said, "Guess he thought that movie was pretty shitty," I lightened up.  2) Going to watch a movie with the babies (yes, my dogs watch TV).  It's a toss-up between "The Swimming Pool," which I have not seen, and "Heavenly Creatures," which I have.  I'm wondering which one would be the most disturbing.  3) Hoping Paddy Mac is bringing home some more V - tomorrow night is workout night and I must abstain.  4) Didn't want to walk through the door tonight.  I really should post some photos of my lovely, CLEAN house.  I'm also looking for a housekeeper, in case you know anyone.  It's hard to find ones you can trust, and goddamnit, I just  hate  domestic duties.  5) Waiting for word from Bunny about possible St. Paddy's day hookup.  At the same time, I'm trying desparately to convince Fab D to skip choir practice to come drink with a bunch of sinners.  Amen.  6) Furious Jessy's wedding sounded wonderful and probably more fun than the last ten weddings I've been to, combined.  7) Wondering where I can find three foot plaster Buddha for my front yard.  Damn the people who try to kill him like they did my pink flamingos.  8) Envious about both brothers buying new cars.  Sis-in-law works at local dealership and is friends with CFO there (I went to HS with both him and his wife).  Looking for good deal on a used car and a payment plan for people who lose their brand new cars due to layoffs and high vet bills.  9) Can't wait to tell Vicente about absinthe connection.  10) Rash of crimes in neighborHOOD the past few weeks has made me consider a home security system.  I don't care about the shit in my house, no one would want it anyway.  I just don't want anything happening to my dogs.  11) Babies are in the den, pouting, because I am not watching movies with them, but am in home office, blogging away about nothing.  12) Paddy Mac just arrived home with no V.  Grrrrrr  13) Wondering why the fuck I ever started smoking.  14) Decided upon "Heavenly Creatures."  I'll wait for Fab D to watch "The Swimming Pool."

      Fuck Paddy Mac, who thinks he's such the comedian.  Yes, goddamnit, I was frantically searching for my cigarettes, so sue me.  I cannot help it that the tobacco companies put things in the tobacco that make it harder for idiots like myself to quit.  By the way, it's all Russell Crowe's fault anyway.  So there.  PM invited Mark down to watch a movie AFTER I invited R & D (bro and sis-in-law) up to watch Donnie Darko.  Am sooooo excited about upcoming Jake Gyllenhaal movie.  More lusting, please.  Am also very concerned that the guys I am lusting over are becoming younger and younger, thereby making me a letch, or at least a dirty old woman.  HATE IT when I am on Non-Girlfriend status.  Vicente rarely answers the phone and I have no idea if Fab D and I drunk-dialed him last night.  Generally, Paddy Mac tells me IN DETAIL if I've made an ass of myself, but V is not answering cell phone or home phone.  This is what I get for dating a man with children.  I've resigned myself to it, just don't handle it well at first.  PM is lecturing me on the evils of alcohol, all the while downing shots of vodka.  He does not see the irony in this.  This time, I am  really  going to bed.  Waking up this early skews the remainder of my day.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Guess what?  Did not go back to bed...starting reading blogs instead (imagine that!).  That last sentence just rhymed.  Now I  really am  Josie Grossie!  Have no knowledge of events from last night.  Probably pissed Fab D off (I always say this, I'm usually wrong).  Sorry Fab D, for blabbing to a certain person.  I will keep it to myself from now on.   News From Around The Coop:   Paddy Mac bought a new car.  Can see that he's been on the internet, looking at foot pedals and tail lights.  Wonder how much longer before he ghettofies  this  car.  Think PM is right, I  do  have smoker's cough.  That in and of itself is disgusting.  Must quit soon.  Like next week, when I begin workout at DAC with Fab D.  Scottie, the loach, is very hyper this morning.  Most of the time, Scottie sits at the bottom of the tank, out of it.  Much like his human counterpart, whom I still love even though he's a heroin addict.  Nico is the first Min Pin I've met who doesn't lick me.  Perhaps I do not taste that good?  Go ask Buzzy and Sadie.  Nico also makes weird growling noises when he is getting his back scratched.  Puppies can be a pain in the ass but Nico's wonderful!  I'm wondering how Jessy's wedding went, and sending kind regards her way.  I'm thinking my favorite blogs now are:  FHB (of course), Pissed Kitty and Who Hymn's blog, "A Guy and His Blog."  A lot of talent in that group.  WH's latest post made me laugh until I farted.  Am feeling rather Peter Gibbons today, and wish I could get promoted by not really giving a shit and playing Tetris at my desk all day long.  Have a $25 Barnes and Noble gift card that I have yet to spend.  Cannot think of anything I want to buy right now, as I have seven books waiting for me to read them (and 24 magazines to boot).  May purchase three frappucinos and "Lost In Translation" soundtrack instead.  Wonder why the fuck I'm up this early on a Sunday.  Contemplating spending the entire day in PJs and doing nothing (oh, wait, that would be every weekend, lazy git that I am).  Going to watch all three Netflix movies consecutively and mail them back tomorrow.  21 Grams is waiting, and I adore Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.  Experimenting to see how long I can make this post, stating random observations that make no sense and have no interest to anyone but me.  Never, EVER get moisturizer in your eyes.  Mine are still red, 24 hours later.  Remember that scene in Donnie Darko, where Head Over Heels is playing and it segues to all of the characters (high school characters) in the movie?  That is Duncanville High School, circa 1982.  I swear, I used to see guys snort coke by their lockers.  One girl even had coke parties that her  parents  funded.  Insanity.  REALLY want to go out for drinks or coffee with Bun, as she seems undoubtedly too cool for words.  Wonder if that would scare her off (I am NOT a lesbian, just looking for more like-minded girlfriends)?  Am thinking the Eating Disorder Gestapo may be on the right track, as I realize I had breakfast, nothing else, yesterday.  Do the seven baby carrots I ate on the way home from Temple count?  Think Isis is way cooler than fucking Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman.  And we wonder where this body-image problem came from???  I think I'll start saying, "Shazam!" on a regular basis.  FHB's posts are quite amusing, but I'm still trying to figure out who Bebe is.  And Lauren...that is her sister, right?  Mary/Lisa, I have not called because I know I call too early on weekends.  It's the babies...they wake me up early, okay?  I'm calling my doctor next week to up the dosage, so lay off!  Weird how Bun started reading my post (sorry for the long, Faulkner-esque phone call last night).  I say, embrace the NG in all of us!  All three babies are in bed...really  am  going to bed myself now.  "Wasted days and wasted nights."  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      I accidentally deleted two posts while I was inebriated, only worsening condition of my belly.  FINALLY got to speak with Bunny, who seems quite fabulous (and who is very articulate, whereas I was stumbling through sentences thanks to the vodka).  Think I shall follow Stacey's plans, which will be to dry out for a couple weeks.  That plan will last all of 24 hours, until I get back to work and find a shitload of things to do.  Going back to bed with the babies, Sadie, Buzzy and Nico.  Then I am going shopping later because I am depressed.  Non-Girlfriend status again.  Shit.

      Damn it, Tams!  Why the hell must your daughters continue to sell these evil things year after year after year??  I really don't care for sweets, per se, but I could devour an entire box of Thin Mints in less than an hour.  It's horrific.  OKAY, I am going to Greenville Avenue tonight.  D and I were debating parking and DART Rails and drunk stumblings home.  I'm also worried that I might bare certain body parts during the course of the evening, as I feel that EVERYONE wants to see my tits when I am drunk.  I do not want to offend the DFW blogosphere (Dianne's used to it).  So I sit here, planning out my drinking schedule.  Talk about the worst kind of OCD:  Let me see, at 9 I will have a cocktail, followed by water at 9:15, then another shot.  At 9:30, I order another shot with a Diet Coke chaser.  Then I see cool drink down the bar with monkey hanging over the side and order that.  9:50, monkey drink wants to remind me what I just swallowed, so I run to bathroom and practice Lamaze breathing.  10:10, Fab D is saying, hey, let's go here.  I am incoherent and follow like a lamb (suitable anology for this time of year).  FD and I end up somewhere else.  DFW bloggers recognize psychotic Chicken and flee.  I end up on midnight flight to Vegas to marry 18 year-old Pablo, who desperately needs citizenship status.  Sunday morning, I awaken to a husband, three surly dogs (where the fuck  were  you all night???) and a messier house than what I left.  Okay, that does it.  I'm staying home!

      I deleted this morning's post...way too personal, way too many bad memories.  All I can say for the Psycho is: you suck, because on the night before my Sparky died, I was out doing a fucking transport.  Instead of holding him at the hospital.  So sod the fuck off!  On a gentler, happier note:  we are leaving at some ungodly hour tomorrow morning for our monthly (two times this month, since we skipped February due to all the goings-on in the office) corporate meeting.  VERY glad my best friend was invited this time (she's on-site) but am rooming with the other assistants (blow me, I segregated:  assistants/smokers, 1 room; area managers/salsa friends, 1 room; higher up people, like my boss, 2 other rooms.  I'll let you guess who gets the suite.  Oh well, she's earned it.   Christ, I would not want her job!   My assignment for corporate trip to the fabulous metropolitan area known to you and me as Temple, Texas:   pick up the beer .  Some smartass asked why they put ME in charge of the alcohol (thanks Princette, whom I could kiss for saving my tired ass) - because I DON'T DRINK BEER.  I think it tastes a lot like the grass I used to chew on in the backyard as a child.  (That sentence alone explains a lot.)  Made up with Paddy Mac - always good.  Am not one to hold grudges and I hate confrontation.  Would rather live and let live, but PM caught me at a bad time.  To be a little different from my last few posts, here is a barometer of Chicken's Coop at 8:14 p.m.:  Bren - waiting for Fab D and having a MUL with a champagne chaser Buzzy - probably asleep on the couch, having nightmares about not getting enough to eat Sadie - asleep in my lap until just a moment ago, looking all Jean Harlow-ish and pouty Nico Rico - running around and chewing on things he's not supposed to chew on Paddy Mac - doing something to his hair in the bathroom Fish - full, fat and happy My Head - worn the hell out from all that email abuse last night Heart - belongs to Vicente, if you are referring to people; if not, then Sparky/Sadie/Buzzy/Nico have the top spots Fab Dianne - en route, I hope  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      According to one DFW blogger, some might be at Jack's Pub on Yale.  I have not been there, have been to the Green Elephant with Vicente back when he still went to SMU, and all I remember is some disgusting drink and I think V vomited.  Pleasant memories.  Fab Dianne and I will go wherever just to get us out of the Ville and have some fun.  I'm up for it.  I'm hoping Bunny is, too, along with the rest of you who are not getting married.  Don't know what time, just sometime Saturday night.  (Congrats to FJ - I wish you well and the best of luck!)  Now I must run, as I look like a fried egg and I need to do some damage control before driving to V's.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      That is Vicente's current favorite thing to say to me.  Before that, it was "you're a wacko."  So, in honor of my upcoming trip, I am going over to watch "The Wedding Singer" with V and his mom tonight.  Last chance to get any before turning into Non-Girlfriend on Friday.  Must find way to distract M so I can get in a quickie.  It's tough being Non-Girlfriend sometimes.  Here's something to ask yourself:  When you die, would you rather be: (a) buried? (b) cremated? (c) entombed? (d) placed in a dumpster? (e) enshrined?  I've already instructed loved ones that I want what's behind Door Number (e).

      1) I tried unsuccessfully three times this morning to burn a CD (Nero is fucking up lately) and finally ended up reburning on a CD-RW that was entitled "1.22.04 - 2004 Budgets" - hope I didn't need that  2) My assistant convinced me to try Hamburger Helper Chili Macaroni, sans hamburger or any other meat, because she eats it this way and says it's really good - on the stove right now, going to add beans and Mexicorn and cheese - it will be an Anti-Atkins-Diet Fest (and yes, I  do  realize how very white trash this sounds, but I just tasted it and I like it, so sue me and exile my ass to a trailer park)  3) Major rumble with Paddy Mac this evening - always makes me feel like shit when that happens, even when I'm right, like tonight  4) OVERLY productive day at work today, even with my boss out of town - also went shopping at Super Wal-Mart for office kitchen and decided we need a few snacks around the place (I thought I was on hiatus from shopping??? does this work-related shopping count? and why am I craving raw carrots and kosher dill pickle slices?)  5) Composing draft email to VP of unnamed internet company regarding my idea for own internet business (well, mine and Dianne's idea) - Vicente met him in a very serendipitous manner at the aeropuerto last week, struck up a conversation (V will talk to anyone) and told him about me - I'm nervously staring at his business card right now  6) Didn't use the word "fabulous" even once today  7) Someone wants  me  to design their website....hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  8) Realized it  is  a little "different" that I consider my dogs my babies, but do not give a flying fuck  9) Also realized I am bruising much more easily without flesh in my life (but I'm feeling much more energetic)  10) Am starting to think FHB is in the wrong profession and should be writing for a living (although I have no idea what the hell she does now)  11) Am thinking the same exact thing about Pisser  12) Stood up Fab Dianne for workout tonight, as I am broke and want to go for a week on the pass I found on the internet, but didn't make it home in time to do so  13) Wondered why ex-BF thought it interesting to me to mention the Brenda line in "88 lines about 44 women" (and found out he LIED, as Brenda is:  Brenda's strange obsession was for certain vegetables and fruits - NOT the thing about alcohol)  14) Also wondered why I am such a bitch sometimes...blame it on outside influences and take absolutely no responsibility for said bitchiness  15) Contemplated selling all material possessions and becoming a Buddhist (not really)  16) Smoked around 15 cigs (no, I'm not turning into Bridget Jones, God forbid)  17) Folded all clean clothes that had been piled on dining room table for past three days  Bonus Track) Went back to original plan of hiring someone to clean my house every other week, even though I cannot afford it  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Not much, though.  I think I drunk-dialed my BF last night.  Woke up, hit redial, see his number flash up, hang up quickly and think out loud, "Oh shit, I wonder if his mother answered the phone??"  I really must get myself back to my doctor and get some Ambien or something where I can go to sleep.  This isn't even working anymore, not very well, and I'm a crank-ass when I'm undernourished in the sleep department.  What is really strange is that, for the first time in a looooooooooooong, long time, I had a better day at work than I did at home.  Not to say work sucks (it really doesn't anymore) - it's just that my after-hours life always made me feel peaceful and sort of centered, at least on a three-to-four-times-a-week basis.  Not so last night.  Lovely lecture from my mother over the phone (and she lives just down the street).  Thinking I could use a good buffer zone.  Took out my frustrations on Paddy Mac, who got sullen and wouldn't accept my apology (yeah, sod off then).  Did three shots of vodka, drunk-posted, and then possibly drunk-dialed Vicente's house.  Good thing about drunk-posts:  you can delete them.  Well, after almost four years, he's gotta be used to it by now.  At least I didn't break my car.  I'm sorry, Pisser.

      I hate long weekends when they end.  It's like that first day back at school after summer break.  The insomnia didn't help, not at all.  First of all, seems something in the air is invading my sinuses at an alarming rate.  I'm back on Sudafed, which wires me even more than I am naturally.  Second, I woke up every 45 minutes - hour and took about 15 minutes to go back to sleep.  Kept imagining someone was in my bedroom, staring at me, and then would realize the alarm system (aka three Min Pins) would have tipped me off.  It kinda creeped me out a couple of times, pissed me off the remainder.  I knew then I'd be feeling all tired and worn out.  One would think that after 36 years of this, I'd get used to it or something.  Wait, it gets better.  Now I have nothing to look forward to for a few months, nothing major at least, save Vicente landing the San Antonio deal and getting to back to Chicago, since I'll get to spend a weekend here or there with him.  Oh, and joy of joys, I have to go out of town on Friday, spending the night in lovely Temple, Texas for a corporate meeting.  Which means I miss open mic night for Joe and that other guy, and that I won't be attending the St. Paddy's Day parade.  Oh, yeah, and I didn't lift weights yesterday, most likely due to hangover hanging around for the better part of the day - now my upper back is aching and it makes you realize how out of shape you are.  Tonight, I will have drink two glasses of milk.  Take some benadryl.  Knock myself out.  And join the gym at lunch today.

      16 phone calls in 6.5 hours.  All from the same number.  Houston area code - I know no one in Houston.  They keep asking for Brenda.  We have lied and said I was on vacation for six months, Paddy Mac yelled at her, "Stop calling here, you fucking whore!" and Dale answered the phone in Spanish.  Cannot figure out if it is a bill collector or that freakin' Direct TV telemarketer again.  Bill collector can kiss my white Irish ass.  I can only think of one.  Direct TV should give it the hell up, as I do not watch much television at all and plan to start working out two nights a week anyway.  I'd much rather spend my $$$ on Paul Frank watches and makeup/fragrances I do not need.  Oh, and shoes.   Must...buy...shoes.  That damned two-week hiatus!

      Does the same thing go for chickens?  Just got back from a lovely but too filling dinner at Pappadeaux with Vicente and his lovely mother.  Had the Mahi Mahi, blackened, with the Alexander sauce.  SO wanted the crabmeat cocktail but I don't like the way they kill the crabs, so I refrained.  While leaving the restaurant, I turned to the live lobster tank and said, "Sorry guys."  This elicited a strange look from the hostesses (why do they need THREE?), who looked like they were sniffing airplane glue before we came in.  I also received somewhat mean look from Vicente, who thinks I am OTC strange sometimes.  I am.  Deal with it.  I believe I may have to quit smoking, even though I don't wanna.  First of all, I'm having chest pains, which could simply be from the weights I've been surely lifting in the wrong manner.  2, it could be the ciggies, but I do not inhale.  C, I may have back and chest pains from passing out on the den floor during the bday extravaganza.  Last, I don't even smoke the entire ULTRA LIGHT cig anymore.  I think I just light up out of habit and should restrict my smoking to the times I'm drinking.  No smart remarks, please.  It is not all the time.  For two weeks, I am not allowed inside any malls.  We'll check on the progress of this during the coming 14 days.  However, one exception is allowed.  I have to go back to pick up the Paul Frank tennis shoes I ordered.  Or else haul my soon-to-be-firm ass (I'm optimistic) to the Paul Frank store.  I need an oil change but somehow, this seems so much more important.

      One gift from my parents was this vintage cookbook of  Great Dinner Parties .  Circa '72, full of alcohol-related recipes.  I collect old cookbooks and laughed my ass off when I opened the book to page 22, per sticky note from my mother.  This is what I'll be having for dinner tonight..please feel free to drop by and join me:   Sardine Pate    Mmmmm...   2 large pkgs (8 oz each) of cream cheese 3 T lemon juice 2 T grated onion 2 T minced parsley 3 cans (4 oz each) boneless sardines in oil Minced parsley for garnish Radishes  Mash cream cheese with lemon juice, onion, parsley and sardines.  When well blended, vomit.  (Did I just write that?  Please excuse the typo.)  When well blended, form into a mound and sprinkle with minced parsley.  Surround with radishes.  Cover and chill until time to serve.  Makes 10 servings.  (That's nine less friends I'll have later.)  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Birthday Details:  Daytime: Totally boring, slept all day with no-caffeine hangover.  Nightime: Stayed in my PJs while Vicente and Dianne and Dale and Candace and Paddy Mac all did shots of vodka and laughed too loudly and took goofy photos of me and my dogs.  And Vicente, asleep on one of the couches.  We listened to my fucked-up mixes and were supposed to do a drunken audblog but forgot to.  I told everyone at least 13 times how I was going to join a gym today (hahahahaha...I'll do that tomorrow).  Dianne brought a piece of caramel chocolate cheesecake (about the only sweet thing I'll eat is cheesecake).  V and Fab D gave me amazing gifts, both in the tradition Vicente has made, weird and goofy cards and things I would never have bought myself.  Fab D bought me some Clean (that bitch!) and Vicente bought Donnie Darko, which is what I was going to go buy today.  By the way, I've totally lost my mind and renamed Nico "Donnie" -  and he answers to it !  Having the family bday party so I must wash my stinking ass (National Butt Awareness Month and all)  and get to a mall for sis-in-law's bday gift.  I also might pick up some chickens on the way home because my neighborhood is far too quiet.  Didn't try the hangover cure, damn it all.  And I shouldn't have eggs over easy the morning after.  I know better and must be punished for this.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      And I haven't even been drinking.  Well, okay, I had two glasses of champagne earlier, MUCH earlier, but I still feel drunk.  And I really didn't drink that much last night.  (Shit, it's hard to type!)  I woke up feeling this way, even before the champagne.  Intoxicated on your bday...is that any way to spend the day?  Hell yes.

      I found a couple It's Happy Bunny stuffed bunnies at Claire's at The Parks Mall.  Eighteen bucks.  I pressed on one's paw and it told me I suck and that is sad.  By the way, Vicente, I did NOT have a date with a 19 year-old tonight.  I had a double-date with two 33 year-olds, which was almost as fun as having one with you.  By the way, everyone else,  this is not a drunk post .  That will come  much  later, possibly early Sunday morning, as I celebrate 36 years of life (minus last year, which was like living in hell with your ex mother-in-law as your roommate).  And  I  thought I'd never make it to 21.  Besides, drunk posting is not near as fun and entertaining as drunk dialing is.

      Kudos to Fab Dianne, who bought dinner for both myself and Paddy Mac.  PM thinks I'm an idiot - "you won't eat real meat, but you'll devour raw fish?"  Vicente had four shameys (sp?) at the Old Monk and drunk-dialed me from home...couldn't make sushi night.  Much to Mary/Lisa's chagrin, it looks as though I will never have to leave the Ville again, as we now have eight wine shops (well, maybe six), a cigar/cigarette specialty shoppe, a sushi restaurant, a new Super WalMart and a Super Target within 10 minutes driving distance.  Yes, Bunny, I hang around here a lot.  But I actually made it to West Village today!  Am joining the local gym (DAC) tomorrow, forcing them to waive membership fees (they have competition now, he he).  Fab D and I will begin our workout regime next week, three days a week.  Since I have become fucking obsessed with my weight and the circumference of my waist, I feel it a necessary thing to do.  And yes, I realize alcohol is fattening.  This is why we will be working out during the week, rather than chain-smoking and downing shots of vodka chased by champagne.  I also feel workout regime will help me quit smoking (nicotine is the devil, or at least a second cousin).  At one time, not too long ago, I could swim two lengths of an Olympic-sized pool without coming up for air.  At this time, I doubt I'd make it halfway.  And that's a generous guess.  Have found new blog that is very interesting to me (over to the right, above Snarky Malarkey).  I'm still quite involved with the goings-on in Belle de Jour's life.  However, her most recent post left me somewhat depressed and very glad I'm not a prostitute.  Don't know why...it simply made me sad.  Mary/Lisa, who is on vacation with Dalty down in Padre, almost made me piss myself today.  I'm supposed to be off work, took a vacation day, sat around in my pajamas until I was sick of work calling, asking me if I had picked up the laptop yet.  So I dry my hair, slap on three different moisturizers and haul my happy ass up to Oak Lawn to pick up that fucking thing.  Which was sitting on someone's front porch.  What.ever.  I head back to the corporate office to drop it off and run, and while getting out of my car, I'm accosted by two angry residents.  So here I am, makeup-less and wild ass hair, trying to calm them down (and one didn't even speak or understand English), and M/L drives by.  Three times.  With her entire office staff and one maintenance man in the SUV.  They honk.  They wave.  No, that's not true... they do the Miss America wave .  And laugh.  And point at me.  It was classic.  Like I've said before, what goes around comes around.  They had better watch out.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      Dear Evil Co-Workers:  Why did you give me a gift certificate for Express?  After almost three years, have you not yet realized I have an addictive personality whose obsession includes shopping?  Is it necessary to send me further into debt just for a few pairs of Editor capri pants?  Not only that, but did you stop to think I now have to go out and purchase at least four pairs of kitten heel sandals to go with new outfits?  Not to mention new belts, as I now have a waistline that allows belts?   What is wrong with you people?   Am I the only sane person left?    Thanks, you guys...I seriously appreciate it.  I will look FABULOUS on my bday date with Vicente tomorrow night.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      For the record:  "Vicente" is not his real name, it's taken from the famous  urlLink Vicente Fernandez ,  mariachi (or some such shit) star, who I actually happen to like on occasion.  Like right after I've dropped acid.  [Seriously, and in fear of thousand of fans coming after me, he really does have a few good songs, even for a 30-something European-American who listens mostly to 90s+ alternative (whatthefuckever "alternative" means).]  I call him Vicente to protect the guilty.  And so he can show his face at work.  He's the  most fun .  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

What really tantalizes you is that which deviates from societal standards in every way, though you admit that this probably isn't the best and you're not sure what causes this desire. Nonetheless, you've done some pretty nefarious things in your life, and probably gotten caught for them. The names have been changed, but the problems are real. Please stay away from children.

      I swear, the narcissism will subside on Sunday.  I cannot help it that I love to celebrate my bday for days on end.  Someone else made me this way when I was younger and I find it better to embrace my "faults" than to live in denial.  Vicente and Fab Dianne came over last night.  I was slightly well-behaved and only had champagne.  V brought over one of my gifts, which was fucking hilarious.  All these sets of cocktail napkins with old-fashioned photos on them and very unnerving captions.  For example, one set has a photo of two women in ridiculous hats, legs crossed on a couch sitting next to each other and smoking.  Looking very elegant in a rather ho-ish way (what is it about women smoking? and for that matter, maybe I  want  to look cheap, so shut up).  Seated next to them is a sullen little girl with her legs crossed as well (because we all know that  ladies  don't sit with their legs apart).  She's glaring off into the distance.  The caption reads:  monica, dear, that was a precious little story.  now, be a sweetheart and fix mommy another martini.  We watched "Donnie Darko" again (it was Fab D's first time and she wasn't as bowled over as I was).  Or at least tried to, since I got more tipsy as the night wore on.  Vicente was drinking a red wine from Bonny Doon Vineyards (and V rarely drinks these days).  BDV has the most interesting labels (I have several on my door and will be adding this one) and produce good wine that is quite inexpensive.  I say V rarely drinks, because he doesn't, yet he is in the wine-of-the-month club thingie with BDV and receives two bottles each month.  The guy has wine out the wazoo and doesn't drink it.  This is something I don't quite understand, but then again, I'm a FA and I guess I wouldn't.  Took the day off today and really have nothing to do work-related, per my boss, except to pick up a laptop.  So I'm still sitting in my pajamas, it's 8:20, and I feel like eating a frozen pizza for bfast.  I have had NO caffeine, and we're out of Diet Coke and SF Red Bulls, so a mild headache is coming on.  That could also possibly be from the vino, but I'm attributing it to the lack of caffeine (maybe I  am  in denial?).  This afternoon I will take my neice to The Parks mall (closest to me) and we're going to build a bear and eat Chik-Fil-A (well, not me, she will) and go blow my gift cert at Express (this part will bore the hell out of her but I'm dying to spend it!!!).    Tonight, Fab D and Vicente and I will trot down the road to Toshio's, which is the only sushi place here in the Ville and quite tasty, although not my favorite.  They have been around 15 years and just recently moved into the daring new Main Street Station, which offers loft apartments.   Loft  apartments in  Duncanville ?  First, the booze.  Then the fancy apartments.  And then Costco and Pappadeaux.  We're going to hell in a hand basket!  (I still think I need to run for City Council here, since my beloved hometown really needs a bit more shaking up.)  Sorry for this rambling, ADD-ridden, totally-about-me post.  My mother spoiled me incessantly as a child/teenager, so I'm blaming it on her.  (I love you, Mom)  It's more fun this way...C 2004 your-non-girlfriend.com

      This goes out to my office mates, who surprised me (sort of, I kinda guessed) with an early bday party.  Pizza, cake, the movie "Thank God It's Friday" (my boss said the girl with the pink hair reminded her of me, not the hair, her personality).  Thanks to Mary/Lisa, who organized everything even though I told her not to (and was WAY too generous with the Sephora cashola and the Paul Frank flip-flops).  Thanks to my Dalty, who gave me an awesome smelling candle and cool dog poster.  Thanks to the entire crew, who gave me $150 to blow at Express, plus a cut-out Barbie to use for my door.  And thanks to MM, who didn't need to spend  her $$$ on those "Hi, My Name Is High Maintenance" PJs (but I'm glad she did!).  Thanks as well to Park for the adorable stuffed monkey.  Thanks to my boss for letting me take it easy today.  Whew!  I think the Academy would have turned on the music about halfway through that speech.

      The guy at sexwithchickens.com misspelled Bak.  There is no O in Bak.  Take it from me, I know.  I am constantly clucking.  This post is dedicated to:  Mary/Lisa, Bunny and Paddy Mac, who all believe I am homebound and will not drive ten miles away from the coop.  I'm telling you, it was the  tires , k?  I'm hell on wheels these days.  This brings me to:  I'm tearing through Las Colinas to get to V's quaint (ha) cabin-in-the-woods (as opposed to my cabin-in-the-hood) so we can go out to eat with his sister and her children.  V's sis is pretty fucking cool, and I'm not just writing that because she now has a link to this blog.  She one of less than one hundred psych nurses in the AF, she's totally open-minded (even though she probably wouldn't agree with my LOTR Oscar-Sweep Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), plus I can show her my new tats without that look I get from people who remind me of the old women in the church I grew up in.  I just have to watch it in here now because she  is  a psych nurse.  I already admitted to her that I'm insane.  Request for extra drugs was denied.  V agrees with me - in the DMN the other day (I think yesterday), a reader sent a letter to the editor (let's just give up and call it an email to the editor, please) about all the hoopla re: the Mel Gibson movie.  I'm paraphrasing, but basically, they said this:  Okay, now let's see him do a graphic movie about another religious event, perhaps the Spanish Inquisition.  Me:  Great, I want to see Christians torturing people in the name of our Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  This is why I have my own religion (no, you cannot join) and worship the way I know best - by living the way I was meant to live, by being true to myself.  And by practicing good karma and saving dogs and trying to be pleasant.  Most of the time.  And by trying to behave, but failing miserably more often than not.  And there are other things, but I believe your spiritual beliefs are and should be PRIVATE.  God has a special seat for people like me, although some think I will go to hell.  It would help if I believed in hell other than it being just a metaphor for people who had not taken Psych 101 in college.  Speaking of hell,  I've already been there .  I was married to Psycho Boy for 18 months (nickname changed to protect any myself - he's stalked me before).  That pushes me on to the next topic of this  overly verbal post :  J (V's sis) and I are looking up everyone we know at www.allbirthdays.com (or some such shit) and I catch a glimpse of a website called Locate Me.  So I pay the fucking $20 to get a report on my psychotic 2nd husband and learn that he's been using my current address as a place he's lived.  And my parents' address.  And addresses I could not recognize.  And the dates are all wrong.  (I hope to God he finally remarried, the basket case.)  Fuck the privacy act and open records...let me tell you this:   YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM ANYONE.   Which sucks.  Granted, it is helpful in catching the "bad guys," but come on, I'm one of the good guys and I don't want him knowing my address.  Left V's cabin in a distant, reflective mood.  One bad decision and you are marked for life.  Or at least have to keep your number unpublished.  One last less-amusing (as if the above really were so) rant:  Why the fuck does my hair looks so damned cute when it's 11:45 on a Wednesday night, but look sooooo awful when I go out?  Damn.

      I'm driving home from work and I see a vanity plate that reads "Mr Cut."  Is he talking about his dick, or his muscles, or  what ?  The things you see in the hood - sometimes amusing, sometimes scary, always entertaining.  Well, except for the unnecessarily high number of stray dogs.  But that's another post altogether.  Mary/Lisa is in trouble for not telling me that I had my Bad Gal eyeliner all smudged under my eyes (and not in a good way).

      Will have mucho problemo blogging this week, as I have been required to account for every bit of my time.  It is driving me crazy, as our executive coach said it would.  Seems I'm the only "quick start" amongst a bunch of "follow-throughs" and "fact-finders" - and I'm slightly ADD most of the time, which isn't helping.  My boss calls me "organizationally challenged."  I'm wondering if I can get handicap status for this?  It would make parking at the mall much easier.  Damn.

       There shall be some  celebrating  tonight!  And that's all I have to say about  that .   (For once, I'm short-winded.)   Bunny , if you are out and about in the lower Greenville area tonight around 10:00 or so, drop by the  Cavern Club .  It will be me, V, Fab D, Paddy Mac and Jason from Austin.  Jason is an excellent bagpipe player and tours here and in other countries.  I'm drinking champagne cocktails and blogging.   For the time being .  I almost always like to drag out getting ready on the weekends...kind of reminds me of being in high school/college, where I meticulously painted each nail and changed outfits four times.  (I still do that, come to think of it.  I'm such a  girly girl .)  Fortunately for those hauling my happy ass around tonight, I've already decided on the outfit.  I  think .  Sometimes I just love being 16 again, even if it's only in my head.  Right now, PM and Jason are in the other room, looking at photos from the last camping trip in Big Bend.  Jason's a pretty damned good photographer, and his eye for unusual shots is very obvious from this batch of pics.   I don't like to camp.   Car Camping even makes me nervous.  I don't like bugs, I don't like public showers, and ticks seem to gravitate towards me.  I remember one night, when Fab D and I had been drinking with the boys, and she signs us both up for the next trip to BB.  I'm looking at her with one eye all squinted, thinking, "You've got to be  fucking kidding  me."  Ask V about the Thunderbird Motel in Niagara Falls.   THAT  is my idea of roughing it.   Porn set mirrors and all .  I was thinking more about the smell factor I wrote about earlier.  When I was in that ill-fated writing group, "Lush.", one of the pieces I included was called " Noxema and Cigarettes ."  Now, when I open a new compact (Cover Girl is all I've ever used, no matter what, when it comes to compacts, "Creamy Natural"), I remember Addison, and   Sparky  as a puppy , and no sleep, and Psycho Boy calling me at six in the morning after Mary/Lisa and I drunk-dialed him on my bday.  I remember Lifetime Movie Network and cheese pizza and cheap wine and passing out with Sparky running rampant through my apartment.  There are times I wish I could go back to that time, redo all the idiotic things I did (and there were a  LOT ).  Guess those things just make me who I am now, right?  Music does that to me, too.  Not just in a romantic sense, like "oh when I kissed Steven" or anything like that, but more like   periods   of my life, who I was then and who I am now and how those two people really aren't that different.  Come to think of it, I don't want the whole  Eternal Sunshine  thing.  I like remembering too much, even if it brings me to tears.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       I want a nun smoking a cigarette to bring me a cocktail.    Sensory Overload   I know everyone says that your  sense of smell  is the strongest of all five (or six, depending upon how many you have), because it triggers memories so much more strongly than the other four.  Once I read that, years ago, I began to pay attention to smells around me, and found myself going back days or weeks or years and recalling both pleasant and unpleasant memories.  For example, I love what  Cascade Complete  does for my dishes (I can't believe I just wrote  that !).  I hate what it does for my memory.  That damned burnt orange gel with little brown or ick green dots in it smells just like those  St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children .  My problem with this?  As a toddler of only fourteen months, I found a way to turn drawers into stair steps, climbed up to stand on top of the counter, opened the cabinet door and found the bottle of those damned things at the very back of the top shelf (my, what an  enterprising  little girl!).  This was before Child Proof Caps, and I downed the entire bottle.  I must have liked that taste/smell  back then .   Monkey Girl  then walks into the living and stands in front of my mom, seven months pregnant with Paddy Mac.  I'm surprised she didn't give birth right there when she learned of my  naughtiness .  I'm not surprised they didn't pump my stomach, because the first memory I have from my childhood is vomiting spinach all over the hospital emergency room floor.  (Second memory: the moon landing.    I shit you not  .)  ** One would think my parents would have seen  Potential Chemical Dependency  looming around the corner from that one little act, but ah, we were all so  naive  back then! **   Maybe Baby  cologne, by  Benefit  cosmetics, along with their entire  Bathina  product line, smells like my mom did when I was young.  Really young, like six or seven.  Before I realized my parents were not God.  There were also these secretarial hand cleaner moist towelettes I found in a drawer at my first office job (we didn't use computer then...again, I shit you not).  They smelled remarkably similar.  I held onto one package until it disintegrated or someone decided to throw it out (it was unopened, mind you).  For a while, I felt like I had the safety and comfort of youth right there with me,  in case of emergency .  No glass to break.   The smell of  Sparky   lingered long after his death, in bed clothes (yes, I washed them), in the blankets the babies slept on, on pillows.  That was and still is  my favorite smell .  His fur had this outdoorsy scent and his paws reminded me of Fritos.   Actually, all dogs' paws smell like Fritos to me .  Anyway, I love the way my other babies smell, kind of innocent and like childhood, but Sparky's was the best.  I used to just set him in my lap and just  inhale  his back.   Some smells I  hate .   The smell of a cavity being filled at the dentist.  The smells of a hospital of sickness and death and sadness.  The overwhelming smell of flowers remind me of funeral homes and weddings ( I hate both ).  The smell of your skin after tanning.  The smell of an  ashtray  (never thought I'd be one to admit that, eh?).  The smell of vitamins, especially when enriched with iron.  Maybe that's why I keep smoking?  To keep at bay all those smells that remind me.  Of good things, of bad.  So I end up with that  Eternal Sunshine thingie  that drove Jim Carrey crazy.

       to get you through this post    LONG  night ahead of me, I'm afraid.   LONG post ahead of you.   Feel free to skip it, since, as Bunny says,  I'll probably just delete it in the morning .  (No, Bun, those are the drunken posts that have the potential to (a) get me into trouble with Vicente and/or (b) make  no fucking sense  whatsoever, or at least make a lot less sense than the rest of my posts do.)  I had to delete some of my blog links.  This computer is plotting against me.  All sorts of bad things happen when I visit certain sites.  I've had to reboot twice this evening since returning home from my Date Night.  I'm concerned with the  LACK OF POSTING on Bunny's part .  Come on, don't have a life, Bunny,  be like me .  Actually, I   do   have a life, I just cannot yet admit I have an addiction to this.  Like I just   know   what I write is oh-so-interesting.  Who wants to hear about three bratty Min Pins?  Or how much I lurrrve Vicente?  Maybe you do, I don't know.  (How very  sad  for you.)   Should I do another quiz?  Should I, Should I?   Okay, okay, ya talked me into it:   1)  Most disgusting thing you've ever eaten?  Unintentionally - the fly that dive-bombed my open mouth when I was eight (yes, even then, my mouth was typically open) Intentionally - a baked egg, which stayed down all of 45 seconds before I started projectile vomiting in my living room and scared the shit out of my dog, Buffy   2)   Nastiest  habit?  I routinely go to bed with my makeup on (What? You thought I'd say I eat my own  boogers  or something?)   3)  Meanest thing you've ever done?  To myself - gave Ex # 2 ( Psycho Boy ) a second chance   4)  Ever let someone photograph you in the nude?  Of course, haven't you seen the video?   5)  The most important thing for you to do before you die is...  Accept and love my body, just the way it is or else  have  hot monkey sex  with Scott Weiland    Off to more interesting subjects...   ...or maybe not.  I see that  Paris Hilton  may be advising her  very proud parents  on reality television.  I have nothing to say about this except that if  Seinfeld  had stayed on the air, we might not have all this  shit .  I want a reality show that is "real" - like "Saturday Nights In The Chicken Coop" - you wouldn't have to worry about missing an episode since they are all pretty much the same:  drinking, disco dancing, Chicken falling down and getting yet  another bruise , Chicken falling asleep on the couch, her so-called friends pulling evil pranks on her while she ZZZZZs.  Min Pins in the background, ready to pounce on her face and lick the shit out of it because "Momma's just too   dirty  !"  Okay, folks, it's 12:01 a.m.  I am this much closer to falling asleep.  Not really.   Whoever invented insomnia should be forced to read a 50,000 word post by me .  POWs probably had it easier.  I'm slightly upset by the amount of  boobage  I've lost due to recent reduction in my body fat and poundage.  Typically a 36A all my life (my ribs are HUGE), they sprouted on up to a 36B (and then some) after my nips got the jewelry.  I lose weight and now the 36 is falling off me (well, figuratively speaking) and it's on the tightest notch.   Let's not even begin to talk about  cup reduction  .  I am  so  going the route of Bad Mamma Jamma and gettin' me some of those!   Question of the night:   If science is so ahead of itself and we're all reaping the benefits,  why the FUCK has someone yet to come up with the solution to moving all one's fat from one's ass/belly/thighs to their  tits ?   We need to form a PAC on this one, honeys!  Copyright 2004 Non-Chesty-Girlfriend

       and wishing it tasted more like  cheese pizza  .  I think that the time of day (or night) that I go to the symphony helps heighten my enjoyment factor a  GREAT  deal.  For instance, V closed his eyes more than I did tonight (he said that's the way he likes to listen to the music).   Shostakovich totally threw me.   Someone ought to create an animated movie with no words,  just that fucking piece .  I wanted more of that shit!  ( Who's  doing this review,  Betty Ghetto ?)  The Rachmaninoff was better this time, too.  His first concerto, played at the end of the evening, was reportedly not as well received in the U.S. as his other three.  I think they were all smoking  crack .  The first was the best of all that I've heard.  Yes, definitely a good move, Vicente, switching to the Thursday night tickets.  I am most certainly a night owl, and now I'm wired from such an amazing performance.  (Yes, Cap'n Kidd, I'm still wide awake, toots.  I do sleep sometimes, but won't be, not that much, not tonight.)

      I am hoping the Thursday night series will be  kinder  to me, and I won't fall asleep.  However, I just glanced at the April calendar and goddamnit if it isn't more  Rachmaninoff  - Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 4.  They threw this in for good measure:  Shostakovich: Symphony No. 1.   Oh my  God  and they are playing Piano Concerto No. 3 next Thursday.   One day, I'll pull out my lighter, hold it up and yell out "Freebird!"  (Perhaps this music is the cure for my  insomnia ?)  Okay, so I feel a little  guilty  for complaining (especially after I found out how much he spent on season tickets, yikes!).  I'm not  really  complaining, just bloated from all the beans and I don't want to have to get dressed up.  And my house continues to deteriorate, and someone's coming to visit this weekend.  Which means I have to stay up  LATE  tonight and clean as much as humanly possible between 10 or so and 6:30 a.m., when I need to start getting ready for work.  I will finish cleaning on Saturday.  And  yes , it should take me  ALL FUCKING DAY .  Vet visit for both Nico and Buzzy next Saturday.  Not a fun trip (I end up covered in  bloody scratches  from their freshly clipped nails).  Buzzy makes this  horrific moaning  like he's being tortured to death.  Nico won't stand on the table and ends up clawing the shit out of my neck.  Someone always has to go with me because I simply cannot handle the two of them alone.   Weekend is shaping up like this:    Thursday night  - Rachmeofftosleep with Vicente at the DSO  Later on Thursday night  - frantic cleaning of the Coop  Friday night  - early drinks with Dianne, then off to watch Oliver's Army play at the Cavern Club  Saturday  - CLEANING AGAIN ( goddamnit !)  Saturday night  -  no fucking clue , probably falling asleep on the couch again, like I did last Saturday night, and get molested by three Min Pins while everyone else watches and laughs at me  Sunday  - I'm not doing a   fucking   thing except what I want to (and Paddy Mac will   NOT   have control over my remote!)

      First of all, to Vicente:  It will take  more than three dates  to make up for your comment this a.m.:   Last night was the worst night of my life.   Okay, so the Min Pin Circus Ole ( sorry, Smitty, it just fits them ) kept you awake?   Drink , like I do, you won't notice.  Or better yet,  get on some medication .  You certainly weren't too tired to have sex this morning.   Ambien and alcohol, honey .  Besides, I can think of  two other nights  that might have been worse:    The nights you married both of your exes.    So  there .  Oh, yeah, one more thing...if you were serious about Banky setting you up with his "smokin' hot friend," think again.  Remember, I will soon be receiving the company credit card...and I haven't been to  Express  lately.  And  no ,   PMS  was two weeks ago .  This is just  plain old S .  (Besides, I question your definition of "smokin' hot" sometimes.  But not when it pertains to  me .)    On to the rest of you...    I grew bored of the quizzes (I think I can hear a collective "Thank God!" out there).   Now I think I shall simply rant.   Below, a list of things that  really fucking piss me off .

Well, maybe)  19) Domestic duties   20)  Guys who won't give head  21)  Guys who do not realize the importance of   kissing    22)  Assholes, both men and women  23)  Old people that should not be driving anymore  24)  When the girls at my nail salon speak in Vietnamese  25)  Anxiety attacks  26) Hangovers   27)  Guilt imposed by someone who claims to care for me  28)   Guilt in general   29)  Having to answer questions about not eating meat, and the jokes that inevitably arise from me saying I don't  30)  Fast food restaurants that consistently screw up my order (especially when I go by there each morning for my goddamned bean and cheese tacos and they still ask me, " No  meat  ?")  31)  Hypocrisy (see Religious Fanatics)  32)  My hair  33)  The zit on my cheek that has now reached  mammoth proportions   34) Exercise   35)  Age-ists  36)  Fat-ists  37) Any kind of -ists   38)  Having access to  128 television channels   39)  The state of my house  40) Being too poor to afford a housekeeper   41)  My addiction to cheese pizza  42)  ' Haters ' (not even sure what they are, I just think that they should piss me off)  43) Running out of cigarettes 44) Running out of alcohol   45)  Running out of frozen cheese pizza  46)  Forgetting I have nails again, and clawing the fuck out of the  puffy pink triangle  in the corner of my eye that eyeliner seems to grativitate towards  47)  Getting up at seven to get ready for work  48)  Getting up at eight to get ready for work  49) Having to go to work at all   50) Cleaning house  (oh wait, I said that already)  51)  Extremely conservative/liberal people - moderation, guys...

      I really   am   in trouble.  V stays up until 1:30 working on our project; Chicken plunks herself in bed by 10:30.   First  profit  goes to Vicente...no matter what he says.   Here's a farking quiz for ya, in case you haven't had quite enough.

       What am I doing up at 4:22 a.m.?   I woke up from a terrible dream in which Vicente and I broke up (me being the breaker-upper) and proceeded to snuggle with the V.  Then good ol' Buzzy starts his  licking fetish thing  on Vicente's hand and spoils the mood.  So the four of us (myself,  three bad Min Pins ) head out to give V some peace.  (He is the most fabulous, and is working hard on my website, while Chicken and Mary/Lisa go celebrate ng with the tiniest vodka shots imaginable at a local restaurant).  I'm a bad business partner, great (i.e.,  fun ) girlfriend.  Oops, I used the  evil  GF term in here.  I think I may be in trouble.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I've got this  Latte and Biscotti  candle going in my office.  Ummm.  Kinda makes me think of  pancakes  or something.   Let us recap the last four years:   (in  chronological order ,  mind you )  May 2000 - Met Vicente for the first time (sorry, V, was   not   impressed)  July 2000 - Talked dirty to V for the first-of-many times:  almost turned his truck around but alas, SMU kept calling  August 2000 - Took the fool and his two friends to the airport for a "long weekend"  (Same month) - Picked them up, jumped Vicente,  crawled away in shame  (not  really )  January 2001 - Became "somewhat exclusive" (meaning he still got to go out with other people)  January 2004 - Put my foot down on "GF status" and "nongirlfriend" was born    Oh God, the rest is history!

       All the original ideas have already been thought.   Therefore, I give you my own quiz, prompted by  Catnip's  quiz early, early today.   1) Which American President would you bonk, if you had to bonk one of them?   a  Abraham Lincoln  b  George W. Bush  c  Hillary Clinton  d  Ben Franklin (wait, he wasn't a president)  d  Thomas Jefferson  e  Millard Fillmore  f  That short, fat, balding one   2)  Spit or swallow?   a  I don't do BJs  b  Spit, of course  c  Swallow, but only if I really like the guy  d  Gargle   3)  If you were zonked over the head by an evil genie who decided that you should become a dog, but let you pick the breed, which would you choose?   a  Poodle  b  Snoodle  c  Min Pin  d  Min Pin  e  Min Pin   4)  If you could meet just one serial killer from throughout history, who would you meet?   a  Ted Bundy  b  David Berkowitz  c  Harry Connick Jr. in that movie where he has really bad teeth and calls underwear "squirrel britches"  d  Albert Fish  e  That creepy old man who lives across the street from you   5)  What do you think about people who actually take the time to make up these tests?   a  They are fabulous  b  They're demented  c  Huh?  d   Vicente is the nicest   e  My ass is sore from sitting here so long  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I stole that from one of those fabulous napkins my non-BF gave me for my bday.  No one ever wrote that on my report card, though.  Those days were  years later .  My apologies for the   ranting   last night.  Sometimes, dinner with my mom just drives me over the edge.  Found out a  dear friend  of mine has been having anxiety attacks, which freaks her out, understandably.  I've had them for four years now, beginning with that first one back after I first bought my house.  I thought I was dying.  I prayed for a  quick delivery into the afterlife .  Finally, my heart and I both calmed down and I went back to watching cable with Sparky.  Bizarre evening - I will never forget it.  Don't remember being that scared, except for maybe once on the operating table when my esophagus closed up just as I was going under (obviously,  I survived ).  They didn't give my friend Xanax; I found it strange they put her on Lexapro.  Then again, as Mary/Lisa likes to remind me, I am not a medical doctor.  I wonder what causes them.  My friend said she isn't anxious about anything; neither was I when the first one occurred.   Then I became anxious about having another one.   I recall talking to the now-departed  Dan The Man , whose father sat on various boards in Dallas, being an excellent surgeon and all that.  He said the symptoms were so similar to a heart attack, many people (especially women) end up in the emergency room, only to leave with sedatives.  Dan The Man later drunkenly drove into a telephone pole, but that's another story.  It's tragic when the creative and gifted ones leave us in such a manner.  He was one of my best friends at the time of his death.  And I don't think I ever told him.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I figured out my mother's frustrations years ago.   She wants more grandchildren.    Specifically, she wants at least one from me .  I find the need to cope with this less often than I used to, simply because no one mentions it anymore unless I bring it up, and they don't talk about it because they don't want any  drama  on their hands.  Until a family member comes along, or even a family friend, and they're spouting off about some baby or toddler, and all the cuteness that goes along with said baby or toddler.   My mother gets this  gleam in her eye .  I know I am a disappointment .   I do not want kids.   I honestly cannot remember a period of time longer than a day when I did want children.  I don't really like children, the  bratty ones  at least.  And the bratty ones seem to be taking over.   *  I don't  want  to be pregnant.  *  I cannot carry a baby full-term, and bed rest would drive me  more insane  than I already am.  *  I read " The Yellow Wallpaper " at a particularly influential point in my life.  *  I really don't know any man I feel comfortable combining genes with, as I feel I'm pretty doomed to begin with and he cannot be much better.  *  Babies only smell good the first few weeks.  Then they  stink  and  shit  all the time and  urp up on you .  *  Babies turn into  teenagers  eventually.  I   do   realize that God so wants to pay me back for the years of 1983-1985.  My  poor  parents.  *  Dogs are  perfect  substitutes for babies.  And in this "day and age," I can get by with being a little too attached to my "babies" (hell, they make whole stores for people like me!).  *  I'm afraid I'd screw them up.  Being screwed up myself, I don't want to do that to another human being.  So I guess my mother will have to "make do" with her one, lone grandchild.  She already spoils that one enough as it is (I'm still waiting for my dogs to be spoiled but  whatever ).  I wish she could see it as "making do" with her only daughter doing what she wants to do, and that is not this:  Being married, cooking dinner every night (or a great part of the time), being someone's wife, coming home to the same routine over and over and over again, doing homework,  doing housework , doing yardwork, being a soccer/gymnastic/dance mom, just being "suburbia."   It boils down to this:  She feels cheated, I feel fulfilled.   If the roles were reversed (for me), and I gave in to parental/peer pressure (because believe me, I feel it from my "peers" as well), I'd be  miserable .  So instead of hoping for a beautfiul, talented, smart, funny, darling grandchild,  my mother should be thankful that she already has this beautiful, talented, smart, funny, darling daughter who is doing what makes herself happy .   It  has  to be right when I feel this good.   (but still a little bit   pissed off  )  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       Don't ask.   Big Bro tells the story much better.   Pyschotic  dinner with mom, dad, Paddy Mac, Big Bro, D, Niece and Visiting Out-Of-Town-Relative (by marriage only, and I'm certain he's glad about that).  My mother cannot have company without completely losing it, worrying that her children might  embarrass her .  Kind of almost makes me want to do that, but I've grown up and just keep it inside, bitching about it in the car on the way home with Big Bro.  Apparently, we were not allowed inside her home if we smoked a cigarette on the way back from the restaurant.   This, I do not get.   It's not like we lit up in the living room.  It was on the way back to their house.  My mother needs the medication I'm on.  My non-BF needs my sleeping pills.   I just need free prescription drugs because I'm broke and you don't want me off my medication.   And my parents wonder why I drink???  The Relative sat through the  Irish Inquisition  as my mother asked him numerous questions, cut my father off mid-sentence a couple times and gave me the  Evil Eye  once or twice.  The Relative works in the movie industry and seems to be pretty conservative.  Directly across the table from him sits this Chicken,  all wild-hair-up-her-ass and look-at-me!   The Relative spoke of famous people he's met during the course of his career.  Big Bro said he'd rather be   infamous   than famous.  I said I'd have to agree.  (Evil Eye Number One from the maternal parental unit.)  Then Relative told amusing Practical Joke story ( I love a good practical joke ), so I relayed my own PJ from earlier this evening.  (Second Evil Eye from mom.)   After dinner, I decided that two EEs were enough for any given month, I had to be going.  After dinner, I made a hasty exit, feigning "work" (i.e., work on the website).  I came back to the Coop, got into my  comfort clothes  (boxer shorts, tank top), let the babies roam freely in the jungle that is my backyard, and promptly lost my dinner.  It's that damned gas cloud, I tell ya.  I really don't know about  Nico .  He's the youngest (less senior) member of my family, only having lived here about four months or so.  He still seems to be aloof when I go to pet him, then he warms up to me.  Then bites me (play biting, but  still ).  It's been a little difficult, since he was the first permanent addition since the death of  the Sparkster  last June.  Which marked the beginning of my  descent into insanity  (some might say I was there already).  I just had this thought:  it's a really good thing I didn't have a blog back then.   Psycho Chicken.    With three heads .  I'm so predictable.  I watched fucking  Lifetime Movie Network  this Sunday.  It really  is  just a matter of time before I succumb to its evil clutches.  What's even more frightening is the fact that I am not ashamed to admit it.  Of course, I also listen to  Starland Vocal Band  at work at an audible level, so it really isn't a surprise.   Bunny , I'm still trying to figure out when  Velvet Revolver  will be in Big D.  I couldn't find it on Ticketmaster and  The Edge  isn't giving it up.  By the way, Bun, had the chance to be one of three people on  Diva Radio  that got to meet him when they played the Bronco Bowl some years back,  but my boss made me work instead .  I also came  THAT CLOSE  to winning a signed Fender Strat on The Edge but happened to take a swig of Diet Coke right when Jagger asked the final question and I instead won tickets to P.O.D.  (I really should have voted that bitch off the island but hindsight's 20/20, right?)  Yeah, I live in the city that has  Mower World  as its claim to fame.   Pity me .

      I look like a cross between Robert Smith and the Bride of Frankenstein.  Puking is no longer a pasttime; now I absolutely hate it.  ( And just when you thought you would never again have to hear about the  Ass & Belly Disease  ...)  M&M started it.  Or maybe her mother did.  Then I got it about the same time Big Bro did.  I'm not sick, exactly.  I just seem to have some  immovable pocket of gas  somewhere in my small intestine.  This is not a funny-fart-joke posting.  This is  serious .  This  really  hurts.  Okay, maybe one or two fart jokes.   On to more pleasantry...   The Practical Joker People in my office warned me they were plotting.  I'm just an idiot sometimes.  Plus, I was running low on cigs and damn it, if someone put a twenty on your desk,  you'd use it, wouldn't you ?  The Conoco near my house - all the guys there know me.  They have MULs pretty damned cheap there.  So I ask for my cigs and buy a Sugar Free Red Bull as well, hand cute, younger Conoco clerk the twenty.  He hands me my change and I turn to leave.  As I am walking out, it's "Miss, Miss!  Come back!"  I (unknowingly) attempted to pass off a  counterfeit twenty dollar bill .    So I called PJ Person Number One and told her that the money she gave me to pay me back (for some reason, I just  assumed  someone gave me money for lunch the other day) was counterfeit.  I can hear PJPNO and Number Two, along with my boss in the background,   all laughing their asses off  .  "I don't owe you any money!  We thought you'd figure it out, we didn't think you'd use it."  Well, of course I was going to use it.  It was fucking money.  Or so I thought.   They should saint me.   When #1 asked, "Where are you?  Do we need to come bail you out?", I should have given them directions to the Duncanville jail.  They were already looking at a 12 hour day.  What's one more hour when they show up and I'm laughing at home, three blocks away?     Chicken will be avenged.   I am anxiously awaiting input from anyone who can come up with something really mean and funny.  Feel free to comment or email me.   These two will PAY!

      Since Bunny's been having  problemos  with her new computer, I decided to come home at lunch and check to see if I, too, have been hit (I've been to Quizilla a time or two).   Yes.   Grrr... thank God  I'm on DSL, though, since it was a program that uses dial-up access.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      It's not enough that I fell asleep in the first half of the symphony, I had to be late coming back from intermission and get locked out of part two (they were recording).  So I sat outside, smoking, and got to witness several gaseous emissions from a kid (and/or his father) and I also got to meet Red, a Dingo mix ("Maybe the dingo ate your baby?").  From there, it was "Vicente, I'm HUNGRY" in a very whiny voice.  We ended up at West Village, sipping wine (me, gulping) and eating fabulous food at Cru.  I feel bloated and huge and a little tipsy, and now I must go work on Homework (Unrelated).  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I am going over to  Catnip 's side and confessing that I, too, am a   Blog Whore  .  I've 45 minutes to write and watch one of my favorite movies, all diced up for  Lifetime Movie Network  (see? I told ya it wouldn't take long).  For the female persuasion out there, rent/netflix it:   Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her .  Guys won't get it;  boys are stupid .  But  you'll  love it.  May I be honest here and say that  I do not understand spending dinero on symphony tickets ?  Not being a big classical music fan, I tend to  fall asleep .  Okay, lambast me, I don't care.  I just don't like the music all that much.  Vicente, having his undergrad minor in Music,   loves   the symphony.  Yesterday, I tried to persuade him to take his ex-stepson, but was not successful.   Hell, take my  mother .   She likes that shit.  And yes, I know that makes me narrow-minded and sound entirely limited, but  I swear to God, it puts me to sleep !  Maybe I should start listening to classical music at night to fall asleep?  Instead of chemical dependency?   Naw.   There are two  fabulous  elderly ladies who have seats next to us on the balcony ( another gripe:  I'm afraid of heights and prefer his cheaper, 1st floor seats ).  I doubt they're lesbians but wouldn't it be cool if they were a  couple ?  Both husbands in the ground, they attend together every year.  They were also very polite and overlooked my  snoring  the last time.  I have a feeling that if I got them to myself for a few hours, supplied them with wine and tasty nibbles, I'd have   so   many stories to share.  When I'm their age, though, I'll still be going to Aerosmith concerts.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      My "to do" list is interfering with my Lazy Day, which is normally on Saturday, but I was at that damned expo all day, came home, did a couple shots, and fell asleep on the couch.  Now I'm up at seven with the dogs, surveying the mess that is my home and mentally crossing items off the list that are of lesser importance.  Why are you blogging, then? you might ask me.  Well, this is sorta my way of planning my boring day and making you suffer right along with me.   Laundry  - I am officially out of underwear.  This is so not good, and I have to be ready for a "date" with Vicente at 1:45.  Will pause from planning to throw in at least one load.  Well, that's where they all ran off to.   Dining Table  - Still covered in shit.  Not literally (Nico's afraid to jump that high), but I'm sure there are bills underneath the crap that I probably should have paid already.   New Cabinet For My Bathroom  - Again, still lying on top of above referenced table, waiting for someone to come along (not me) and put it together.  Then there is a matter of hanging it on the wall, which will definitely have to be someone else's task.  I can see it now, all my toiletries falling right in the toilet.   Homework  - About four hours' worth.  But I gotta do it or I'll get fired.   Other Unrelated Homework  - This I have to do as well, since Vicente is riding me about it.  I'm trying to find a way to scoot this under the rug until tonight.  I would also like to watch some of my fabulous 128 channels I just got but I doubt that will factor into my day.  Unless I combine it with Homework and putting that damned Cabinet together.  And it's still raining, on top of all that.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Buzzy has this  licking fetish .  Mind you, I am not a pervert who would use this to their own  sick, twisted advantage .  It actually  bugs the fucking shit  out of me.  Right now, he's sitting on my lap, licking on my right knee.  And I want to  PUKE .  (Not from him, from the 3.5 oz. of fish I ate at a certain Pappas Brothers' restaurant, which I will not name... what the fuck  is up with the  Neanderthal-sized  portions??)  Vicente has some stupid poker party to go to tonight.  Fab D may come over.  I've lost my glasses, so in my contacts I have to stay.  Or else run into walls and get even more bruises I will fail to explain.  I'm sparkly right now.  Glittery, shiny, luminous.  I noticed several other sparkly people today, and no, they weren't in drag.  Mary/Lisa has my Donnie Darko DVD, or else I'd watch it again.

       Stole this from Neko, who stole it from Cactushead:   (By the way, Neko, you disappoint me in your choice of Nirvana.  Although they were the best band ever next to the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, STP has   Scottie  , who  FHB  and I are ready to stalk.  Kurt has nothing over Scottie when it comes to the  naked picture .)   First concert?  Adam Ant.   Best show of your damn life?  Stone Temple Pilots at the Bronco Bowl in June of 2000.   What is the most you have ever paid for a show?    $75 for Prince last month.  I usually don't buy, though.  V pays for it (like a good non-boyfriend).   Do you know the names of all the bartenders in town?  Yeah,   Chicken  .  I drink at home where it's cheaper.   Been kicked out of a club?  Now what do  you  think?    Puked in public?  No, but I have pissed in public before.  When you gots to go, you gots to go.    Tipped a stripper?  Of course.   Really spied on someone?  Our next door neighbor when I was 8.   Eaten anything on a dare?  Believe it or not, yes.  Dog food.  I promptly threw up afterwards.   Seen a dead person (not a funeral)?  I saw the  arm  of a dead person, lying on top of a wrecked Jeep Wrangler one night.   Been mugged or jumped?  No.  But Paddy Mac has.   Wooed someone with a mixed tape?  CD mix, yes.    Walked in on your parents?  Yes.  It still makes me laugh.    Do you have a star tattoo?  I have FOUR, Neko.   Wear a denim jacket more than three times a week?  I've NEVER worn a denim jacket.   Know the lyrics to waiting room?  Eh?   Been SXE?  Again...Eh?   Put an andre has a posse sticker on anything?  Who came up with this?   Have more than two band pins of your jacket, shoulder bag?  Eh Eh EH?    Sepultura or Pantera?  None for me, thanks.   East or West coast?  Both.   Vegas or Atlantic City?  Vegas, baby.   Mixed tapes or CD-R?   Please .    Texas chainsaw or Night of the Living Dead?  Both suck.    STP or Nirvana?  Do you really have to ask?   DJ or jukebox?  DJ.  As long as   I'm   the DJ.

      This is what my lovely older sibling told me when he was talking to me about the business expo we're attending tomorrow.   AT SEVEN FUCKING A.M., FOR FUCK'S SAKE!    Ungodly hour , I know.  I'll probably still  reek  (or I would if I drank alcohol that  smelled , which is one of the  many reasons   I love vodka ).  I'm supposed to look cute, be friendly and model my t-shirts (well, one of them).  Because Big Bad Bro designed my logo, I can technically be there without having to pay for a booth.  I just cannot do it all day long because,  damn , I don't want varicose veins.   Get this precious jewel:   Vicente thinks that, as Treasurer/Investor, he needs to be the only signatory on the NG account.   I don't  think so , V.   Just because I have this slight problem with shopping doesn't mean I won't take this seriously.  Even though some Tocca candles would be nice for my NG office.   Arrival from Sephora this afternoon:    Urban Decay eyeshadow in "Grind"  (don't you love it for the name alone???) - light pinky shadow with silver glitters - PERFECT.  I love it.   Tony & Tina Herbal Lip Stain in "Flattering"  - Does  anyone  have success with these lip stains?  Or do I simply lick my lips too often?  By the way,  I'm critiquing pizza now , and fucking Pizza Inn can   suck my fat pizza ass  .  In these parts,  Mr. Jim's Pizza  is the way to go.  I'm parked in Heartburn City and it was from a  WHITE pizza .  Jeez.   Does anyone in the DFW area know of a  reliable  housekeeper?   I'm having serious issues with my house right now.  I hate a dirty house but I hate to clean.   Domestically-challenged , I guess.  Every now and then, I will clean clean clean.  For about 30 minutes.  Then I get bored.  Or distracted (I'm easily distracted, especially by shiny things).  I do laundry, load dishes into the dishwasher, generally keep my bathroom clean.  But nothing else.  Unless someone's coming over and I'm embarrassed.  Which doesn't happen often (the  embarrassed  part, not the  someone coming over  part).  I would like to use Vicente's housekeeper but I don't think she does ghetto houses, only fancy Las Colinas ones.  Besides, what would I do with the dogs???  I now have  fabulous  satellite television.  And have watched it  once .  This is beginning to sound like the health club membership... unused .  Still.   Yes, I know I should go.   I like the  idea  of exercise much more than the  actual act .  Much unlike  sex .  However, I will not be able to maintain current size four if I don't get off my flabby ass (  envy me , I don't care, it took a while to get here and I'm damned proud of it! ).  And it is flabby.   I need a butt lift.   A butt lift, a boob job and liposuction.    Lots   of it.  I keep thinking it will go away on its own (kind of like the cabinet I bought that needs assembly...it's still sitting on my dining room table).  I even talk to it sometimes.  "It's not like I don't  like  you or anything - I've known you forever.  I just want to wear a  bikini ."  Right now, it looks like a tankini is about all I'll get into this summer.  I wonder how Ghandi lost  his  fat?  Or was he skinny to begin with and just got a lot thinner?  Even though I'm the assistant to the president of my company, I no longer get Administrative Professionals Day gifts.  She doesn't consider me "admin" material.  Good, I guess, for my resume and the fact that I hate filing and typing letters and all that shit.  Bad, since I didn't get a free lunch this week.  Actually,  yes, I did.   I took my assistant to lunch (who is awesome, I just love her).  We had the worst service I've ever experienced and of course, being the  bossy ultra high maintenance bitch  that I am, I suggested in a rather  icy  way that my meal needed to be comped.   Ha, even better:   they took 40% off the entire bill.  What should have cost us $70 ended up totaling $41 and some change.  You know, when I order a salad and some fish, I'm probably looking very forward to that damned fish, and when you don't bring it out, I'm a little bit  cranky .  I still tipped him,  sucker  that I am.  I figure they probably took that $30 from him, I don't know.  Copyright 2004  Non -Girlfriend

      I'm one of those  polite smokers  who won't blow smoke in your face (unless you start fake-coughing while you're sitting next to me at a bar, then  watch out, bitch , because you've unleashed the  dragon Chicken !  Yeah, you,  slut  sitting next to me at the bar at Dave and Buster's four years ago, I still remember your  cranky ass !   It's a fucking bar, for Christ's sake! ).   I also try to mind house rules and usually flat out refuse to smoke in someone else's house or car unless they  implore  me to go ahead.  Sometimes, I bring air freshener with me to spray about.  And I don't make Vicente sit in the smoking section at restaurants anymore (not that there  are  any left, but you know what I mean).   SO FOUR HOURS IN A VEHICLE WITHOUT MY CRUTCH PUTS ME IN A FOWL MOOD.   P.S.: I was also craving vodka.  Which seems to be a sign that I should be one of those people at intersections, holding a cardboard sign - not sitting here in my air conditioned home, being totally fucking lazy.  But I digress.  I'm so wanting to motor down to SA this weekend to blatantly market my t-shirt line and see Pisser and get a little tipsy with Bunny.  However, the non-BF thinks a fucking poker game is more important.  And Ol' Red won't make it to Waxahachie (Waco's too far) so I need wheels.  Transport.   Anyone out there willing to drive me to SA?     And let me smoke in your car?     I didn't think so.   Okay,  Rant de Jour  is over.  On to more  interesting  topics.  Or  not .  I  desperately  need to do laundry tonight if I want to wear panties this weekend.  I have never been a fan of not wearing undies unless I have on hot garter belt/silk stocking combo, which hasn't happened in, oh,  fifteen years .   So there.   Yes, I wear underwear.  But not while I'm at home.  At home, I'm  Free Love Hippie Girl Who Likes To Paint Daisies On Her Face And Get Stoned .  Wait, that was two years ago.  I've straightened up and only sought out vodka.   Unless you're buying.   I have a  boner  to pick and it's this:  why on earth do younger guys think they can screw better than older ones?  No, I'm not talking about senile, old farts with lots of money and a bunch of Anna Nicole Smith's running around.  I'm talking  vital, handsome cuties like my V , who is ( yes ) 10 years older than I am but can give any guy from 18 up a  run for their money .  ( No , ladies, he is   not   available.   He's all mine. )  I waited 32 years (when I met him) and struggled through four years of  ambiguity , to get where I am now.    Mind you,   I'll draw blood if you come near.

      V was going to try to work that into the bylaws, too, but with the only other officer being my older brother, I vetoed that  brilliant  idea.   I really must stop smoking.   And  drinking .  If  WH  can give it up, so can I.  I just really don't wanna.  Why the fuck am I up at 5:20 in the morning, you ask?   Because I am an idiot.   And because once I wake up, if I go back to sleep, I oversleep.  And I have to be ready for Erica-the-life-saver (of the ran-out-of-gas incident earlier this week) to pick me up at seven so we can drive two hours to Temple for a corporate meeting.  By God, the Hilton better get the sandwich orders straight this time.   Ms. Ultra High Maintenance  here gave specific orders on her vegetarian delight.  Somehow, every time we meet, even if it is at a different hotel/restaurant/whatever, the wait staff seem to be able to pick me out of the crowd as the one who ordered everything "on the side."  Everyone's wearing jeans.  " Except Queen Bren ," as MF put it.  I'll wear capri pants since my only pair of jeans that fit anymore has a  saggy ass .  Must buy new denim.  Good thing I never wanted a JLo ass since the only place I seem to gain weight these days is in my belly.  It's genetic.  No one in mi familia has an ass; they're all flat.  If I ever convinced Vicente to buy me some  boobs , I'd probably topple over.  New employees at this corporate meeting.  Think I'll wear my "Psycho" t-shirt with a straight face.  Should get ready...will  skip-to-my-Lou  on down to the bath.  Would much prefer to snuggle with Vicente in bed so I'm torn.  Hell, I can put on my makeup in the car.

       That title really has nothing whatsoever to do with my post.   I just saw it on a matchbook Psycho Boy saved from his stint in Germany, and always meant to go to the website.  Get this juicy bit of info:  while I was tethered to PB, I made him smoke outside in his own house.  It seems that before I started chasing the legal dragon, I was allergic to cigarette smoke.  Wish I was now.  Jaden, Sangria may be Satan's Sauce, but he's smoking a Marlboro while he's downing it.   VERY FIRST CORPORATE MEETING TONIGHT.   V said I could write into the bylaws a rule that alcohol MUST be present at all corporate meetings.  He would not let me have it at Pappadeaux, so  cheap-ass  vodka it is.   WATCH OUT PISSER, HERE WE COME!  Yes, Bunny and I are planning the  stalking  of fellow babe,  Pisser , while we still have her here in Texas.  It's basically a free trip, except for gas, food and  alcohol , since we can stay overnight for free.  I just don't remember how the  bonk  to get to the property that has the nice model apartment.   Side note:  Replacing " fuck " with " bonk " for one day as a trial run.  Let the editors know what you think.  Personally, I  hate  it.   Thanks to  Zero , who let me know about new Director's Cut of   Donnie Darko  , being debuted at the Seattle Film Festival in May.  Then released at theatres in Seattle this summer, with the rest of the country to follow.  I was so excited to read that, I pissed my pants!  Just how many times has  Nonnie  seen that movie?  Far too many to count.  In fact, I have renamed my  vibrator  (oops, "personal massage device" here in the fucking buckle of the Bible Belt, Texas) Donnie.  (Former name was "Buzz, My London Boyfriend" as I purchased him in a  sex shop  in London...now that I have a dog named Buzzy, well, that's just a little too  close for comfort .)

      I think someone stuck a pin in a doll or something.  My home computer allows me to post comments on only a few of my favorites.  I noticed on  Jerk Store  a mention of  Tim Delaughter , alumni of DHS, Class of '85.  All the girls were in love with him.  I wasn't "in love" - but I really did want to   bonk him   at least once before he left. What a small world.  It's like what  Jerky Treat  was writing about (another blog it won't let me post comments on, along with  Pisser )...the three degrees of separation of the blogosphere.  It certainly is taking  Dish Boy  a long time to do this install.  I wanted to watch a bit o' telly before I have to haul my happy ass back to work.  The dogs are too quiet.  I don't dare open my bedroom door...  I bet all of you really wish I'd go back to work, doncha?  I've been home for over two hours and the installation is still going on.  Maybe that's why they give you that five-hour window, because that's how long it's going to take.  I bet Dish Boy is wondering when I ever clean up around this place...especially after Nico's deposit in the den.  Waiting on Dish Boy to finish, I decided to read Pisser's archives back before I contaminated the blog world with this crap.  A fight between Pisser and Jerky...I side with Jerky on the dog/cat preference.  However, I am wondering about the biohazard remark.  Certainly other people don't have too much pet hair floating around, do they?  At least with dogs, they shit outside.  Well, except for Nico, who can be in the backyard for 30 minutes but goes right in front of the television to take a dump.  Yea!  It's installed!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      And I worked so hard to build them back up.  I'm at home right now, waiting on the satellite dish people to arrive.  It's been three years since I got rid of cable.  I simply did not watch television.  And the more people bugged me about it, the more adamant I was on not watching the damned thing.  See, I have this  slightly  addictive personality, and I remember all too well the days ( entire weekends , in fact) that I sat watching Lifetime Television For Women.  Or the  Vagina Network , as my then boyfriend called it.  Friday night, I'd run by the liquor store for my vat of wine, order a pizza and sit on my fat ass watching such classics as "Mother, May I Sleep With Danger," back when Tori had her original nose.  Sparky liked Lifetime, too, and he'd sit beside me, watching for hours.  We'd both fall asleep on the couch.  My bed didn't get much sleep action those days (probably not much  sex action , either, come to think of it). I'd have these hilarious conversations over the phone with my mother when commercials came on, both of us slamming the shitty movie we were engrossed in.  Like  Family Circus , you know?  Even though it sucks, you just  have  to watch it.  Now it's vodka and cooking shows.  Of course,  there will always be pizza .  Oh, and A&E.  And Court TV.  I refuse to turn it to Lifetime.   I just won't do it.   Not unless it's a  really  crappy movie.  Then I'll ring up ol' mom again.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      My poor, poor fish.  It was like Donnie Darko, this loud explosion in my living room.  I run in yelling, only to find my babies all over the floor, flopping around.  I found three I missed last night.  Including Scottie, the loach.  This is just too sad.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I haven't been on here long.  I posted, and then after a while, people started commenting.   FHB was one of them.   I remember her first comment.  She's fucking cool.  I kept thinking, some day, I'll meet these people, and I'll  just love  Bunny!  I did.  And I did.   I'm so glad she's back.   It's almost one of those "Lost In Translation" things.  Cool music, smart people, pretty backgrounds.  You ever hear a song that makes you feel resigned and kind of out-of-sorts?  I remember these songs from childhood, and sometimes I dreaded their appearance.  Not so with FHB.  I don't know what's going on, but I love ya, babe.  Let me explain:  Upon meeting her for the first time, I never felt so comfortable with another person.  This lady's remarkable.  I just hope she knows it.

      That first post was for the  luscious Chad  down at UT, studying to become a fucking lawyer  so we all can hate him .   But call him the moment we get in trouble.   It's because of Tera and Chad that I met Vicente, so  that fact alone  makes a special place in my heart for him.  And her.  But actually,  the real love comes from all those happy hours, pre-Vicente .  Remember Truth or Dare, C?  The group broke up, basically.  D moved to Bean Town (I have heard he's on his way back), C left for Tree-Hugging Central, and T had a baby.  A  beautiful  one at that, but it changes everything.  V and I are still together, sparring as usual.  I think some of the old crew take comfort in our togetherness.  How sick and twisted our world would be  if we broke up ?  ( Pretty damned sick and twisted , so no wise ideas there, V!)  Honestly, looking back, those months of drinking-after-AG/FI and showing our tits and teasing C and D were great fun.  Then V enters the picture.  And Sparky gets sick.  And people lose their jobs, or get knocked up, or just have different paths they choose.   Things just change , I'm afraid.  That's what is so difficult about adulthood for me.   The change.   Don't get me wrong,  I love it .  I'd be  bored  without it.  But sometimes, I wonder if change for the greater good means a good change for me.  This is something to think about, and not to comment on, and it's this:  When you were 18, exactly how did you picture yourself at 36?  I look back on old photos, pour through journals, and I wonder  what the  fuck  I was thinking  when I  wasn't even old enough to drink ?  Thank God I never had children.

      Chad, I'm  flattered .  Until this evening, I had no idea you were reading me.  Vicente let the chicken out of the bag.  When are you coming up to visit us?  And  WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU BEEN COMMENTING??   And no, I have not been drinking.  If I had, I would have called you a  fucking bitch .  This is too much.  I feel like you're back in Dallas again, and not off studying law.  (I'm still so sorry for vodka-induced remark about you not yet being a lawyer.)  As for SA trip, you didn't miss much.  A lot of angry OU fans.  NG getting sick and wanting to go home early due to ass & belly disease (I really think it was the crab cakes).  Vicente looking alarmed when I took his AMEX shopping.  Quite a weekend.  As for your marketing advice,   way to go  .  I owe you drinks next time we're all together (or at least another "shotgun kiss" like that time after the Byron, when you were flat out on my bed, staring at the ceiling fan for hours).  I'm thinking a road trip to Austin is in order, and soon.  Rub the Buddha's belly for V tomorrow.  Court day.   You know I  love  you, Chad!   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Okay, I'm "lunching" in today because basically, I'm too lazy and cranky to be bothered to drive three miles for food.  Good thing there's vittles here, or I'd be  really  cranky.  My boss is asking for my opinion on things a lot more than she used to.  It's odd.  Her ideas are terrific, so I'm pretty much saying, "Yeah, you're right" but not in a sycophantic way.  I guess what I mean is that I don't believe in ass-kissing, so I'm hoping it doesn't come across that way.  Who wants a yes-man?   Little Cheer Up To My Day:   Vicente pulled one of his "I just called to talk to the Chicken" phone calls a few minutes ago.  Sometimes, I think he knows when I need that sort of thing, even if I haven't recently talked with him.  Well,  paint me pink and call me  Piglet  , because I just downed a double-cheese sandwich in five minutes.  And I'm still hungry.  And bored.  And boring you, I'm sure, so I'm off now.  In search of more chow.  If I weren't broke, I'd go tan instead.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I am so going to get into trouble with one particular person for last night's post.  However, unlike before, I am not deleting it.  That person will just have to deal with it; they've been told all that happens ends up here.  Bruised the hell out of my left foot on office furniture.  Now I'm limping around and probably won't be able to wear a shoe on that foot.  Also running behind, so no chai tea on the way in to work, damn.   And  I need to make my lunch so I'll even be later than my typical 9:00 late.  Top that baby off with starting my period today and you have one upset crank-ass.

      Okay, to set the record straight  ONCE AND FOR ALL :   I  am  the biggest idiot.   I ran out of gas today for the first time in my driving history (20 years, to be exact).  On 114.  In rush hour traffic.  And I laughed my ass off the entire time.  Running out of gas is quite funny to me.  So  there .  Given this new jewel of information about   Nonnie   (as I've been recently called),  I am Queen Of The Idiots .  Please worship my  stupid  ass.  [Hey  Smartass  Fluffy Happy Bunny -  I never got the email .  Must be because of the server switch last week.  I didn't receive several important emails, yours being the most important.  And I really wanted to be a Bunny for a day.]  Perhaps an office comrade intercepted B's email?  I wouldn't put it past them.  And how I so wanted to guest post on FHB!    Someone I know has a crush on Pisser.    And  no , it's not Vicente, although V thinks you're  smoking hot .  (Those were his words.   How embarrassing .)  Pisser has been deemed a "terrific writer" (we all knew that), cute, Jewish and quoting Frank Zappa ( wtf? ).  I have to have a little chat with my friend.   I want Bun to email me and explain comment posted about shattered lives.  I adore Bunny and hope that  all  is okay.    Chicken got in trouble tonight.   I did  not  do any nongirlfriend homework and was accused of "not being serious" about my new venture.  Oh sod off, V - you were out in Northern Cali  playing  all weekend.   Why on earth would you leave the business plan to be written by a college dropout who Cliff-Noted her way through 3 years of her undergrad Lit degree???   I was catching up on sleep.  All day Saturday and all day Sunday.  Plus I was (and still am) PMSing and you just shouldn't fuck with me when I'm like that.   Here was my assignment:   Business plan (I don't even know where to start), first shirt order (I say 20 of everything, but then again,  it ain't my money ), nongirlfriend quiz and  story of NG .  Story of NG is  borrrrring .  Will have to embellish.  Basically it's this:  it took me 3.5 years to get the guy I've been sleeping with to call me his  significant other .  At which time, I retracted and wanted NG status again.  V's right - labels  can  damage a relationship.   Bring me Ding Dongs.   NOW.    Fabulous Vicente was supposed to come over tonight, but has court case pending and is frazzled.  Fab D isn't talking these days, and I got DD'd by E (or reverse DD'd) on Saturday.   Boys!  Leave me alone !   Except for V, who can bother me  any damn time   he wants to .  You know what H and I used to say when we went out drinking on Monday nights, supposedly coming up with ideas for  Lush ?   Only the professional drinkers were in bars on Monday nights.   Those are the same people who will not drive on New Year's Eve, for fear of being plowed into, head first, by you  amateurs .   I have to sign off with this:   Will you know the  love of your life  when you meet them?  Or will you wait until it's  too late ,   fuck things up   with recriminations and accusations and tearful fights?  Then write  bad poetry  and  drink too much ?  And then wonder how-the-hell-you-got-to-36-being-so-stupid?  I didn't think so.   Goodnight darlings!   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      When I visited Blogorama, not only did I notice that "Hot Abercrombie Chick" is still out there (and is one of the most popular blogs), but there also seems to be a  large number of people who consider themselves idiots .  This I knew, I just didn't realize so many would admit it (or even realize it in the first place).  And they are  proud  to be an idiot.  True, I've called myself an idiot before, but I don't really mean it.  Yes, I've behaved like an idiot on several occasions (typically while under the influence).  I've even made a few idiotic decisions.  My non-boyfriend calls himself an idiot as well, and he is one of the most intelligent people I know.  Does an idiotic action make one an idiot?  So, I'm asking for your opinion on this.  I also would like to know the most idiotic thing you've done.  I'll start off with my own.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Well, guess who forgot to get her sleeping pill Rx filled?  Shit, now it's 1:40 in the morning, I didn't do my "homework" ( shh! don't tell Vicente ) so I'm up doing that now.  Sort of.  And I'm still waiting for the kitchen to clean itself.  God knows Paddy Mac won't do it.  I am   dreading   the late lunch meeting with our executive coach.  Okay, so a free lunch won't be all that bad but I wish I had picked somewhere different than La Madeline.  Not that I dislike LM; I like it a lot.  I just blurted that out before scoping the other eateries in that particular part of town.  For example,  why didn't I say "The Cheesecake Factory" instead ?  Noisier, but with ordering from menus being one of my favorite things to do, that would have been great.  I have not totally incorporated her plan on organizing me due to the lawsuit I've been working on for two weeks.  I haven't done much else, except fend off brokers and try to appease our clients.  I'm unofficially the IT person at our company, which is frightening to my older brother, who happens to be our vendor for IT shit.  Between all of that,  I'm pretty fucking busy most of the time .  Lately, though, I have been doing things during the day to break it up a bit.  Sitting in a windowless office is hell to me, so I make trips outside every 90 minutes or so, just to see some trees and sunshine.  Spring is the most difficult time of year for me, work-wise.  I should have gone into teaching so I could have the summer off.  But I just don't like little kids all that much, so it's probably for the best.   Asinine question (rhetorical, but  still ) of the week:   Mom and Dad, to me - "Did you know that smoking causes lung cancer?"  Thanks, guys.  I'll probably just quit now that I know that.  Ahem.   Comment to voicemail as to why I don't drunk dial anymore:   I've grown up and  matured .   Truth:   I've been trying to stop that.  Never, ever believe anything I say when I'm drunk anyway.  That person is really my evil twin, trying to destroy my life.  Fuck, I really am wide awake right now.  I'll probably fall asleep around 4:45, and I have to get up and get ready 45 minutes later.  I wish I could be like Sadie, who could sleep through an earthquake.  The only thing that will wake her up in the night is Paddy Mac standing outside my bedroom door saying, " Roasted.  Roasted. "  (Don't ask; it's a stupid story, but it always makes Vicente laugh.)  Checked  lovely  bank account balance and I find I am not overdrawn as I had suspected after  SWM  fiesta   on Friday night.  My best bet would have been just to wonder for a few days, because I now have plans to go shopping at lunch (I'll sneak an "errand" run in around 11 so I can buy some sandals I've been eyeing).  Makeup reviews for most recent Sephora purchase will have to wait until this weekend, as I was "frugal" and chose the UPS ground delivery for my Tony & Tina Herbal Lipshine and Urban Decay "Grind" eyeshadow.  I'm still pissed that Hard Candy's  Piglet  was out of stock.   Bright idea:   Maybe I can convince my boss that she really needs to go buy her daughter something at Sephora, since we'll be near Northpark Mall.  I'm debating on those Tocca candles.  My Lola candle is about dead...damn that Fab D again!  She needs to stop pumping up all these products.  Isn't there any holiday coming up where I can finagle some gifts out of someone?  Does Mothers' Day count if your "babies" are your dogs?  Maybe I'll  make it count  this year.   Vicente, if you are reading this (highly unlikely), I'm emailing you my login for Sephora...Bathina Sandal Scandal is much needed.  Thank you.   If I use Smitty's "bloggability" scale, I'm thinking that this particular entry would rate a 1.  The only reason behind it is to put myself to sleep (as well as all of you other insomniacs).  It's having a reverse effect on me, though, since my adrenaline started pumping when I thought of shopping.  Shopping sometimes actually makes me sexually aroused.  The thrill of the chase, perhaps?  Vicente comes home tonight after being in northern California this weekend.  I better stay up all night and put something together to show for him - don't want to piss off my investor.  Off to work...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Those years of anorexia take their toll on you.  At 19, it seems I developed a spastic esophagus.  The cranky thing decides at mostly inopportune times to close, thus hindering my breathing ability.  Like when is an opportune time to choke?  Anyway, this has not happened for about 18 months (except once while I was driving and I managed to shake it away).  Then, this evening, I swallowed coke the wrong way (it's always the sugary drinks that do it to me) and I couldn't breathe.  Paddy Mac tried to do the Heimlic but it didn't help.  I'm gasping, "Bag! Bag!" which came out sounding like, "Bak! Bak!"  Finally, a Wal Mart bag saved the day.  20 minutes later and I am still clearing my throat.  I know that burning to death would be completely and utterly terrible.  But choking to death has to be pretty bad, too.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Obviously, it was an operator error. I lost all my blog links while trying to set up another blog, and now I'm afraid to go back to it. Fear is not always a bad thing, children. Embrace it, learn to love it. Then kick the shit out of it.  Weird evening at the Coop. Stayed up with Fab D until 3:30 this morning, so what the fuck am I doing up at this ungodly hour? I'm eating Candace's ice cream she left here last night, that's what I'm doing. Oh hellish period, please arrive soon, or else I won't be able to fit into any of my clothes. I do not understand the fascination with chocolate this month. I don't even eat the stuff and yet I continue to binge. Right now, it's some kind of mocha ice cream from Braum's with huge chocolate chunks in it.  I'm nervous about the upcoming installation of satellite TV. I haven't watched television in years and now I'm wondering, will I be one of those people addicted to reality TV? I told my parents and friends and non-BF that I'm getting it for the cooking shows, but I think they see through that. I swear to God, if I start watching the Lifetime channel again, will you please shoot me?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I also have a headache I cannot seem to get rid of.  Hey, Smitty, I didn't do SHIT today!  Slept all day after watching part of that K&C documentary.  The only problem with this is that I have low blood sugar and after not eating since midday yesterday, when I woke up at 5:41 p.m (Texas time), I had a raging headache.  No amount of food, caffeine, ibuprofen or water can make this monster leave.  It's eating away at the few remaining brain cells.  Oh well, at least I won't have to worry about Alzheimers, right?  Fab D is coming over again (she was a little upset that I nipped her apple vodka earlier, but there's always Paddy's stash).  So are Double D, his GF, her kid and their dog.  I don't mind that everyone likes to come over and hang out (drink) but I just wish one of them would offer to come over and clean.  Just once.  Not that I'd take them up on it or anything.  Just an offer.  Fab D sometimes gets drunk and begins power-cleaning my kitchen.  She's the only one, though.  Well, I got absolutely NOTHING accomplished today.  Fucking slacker.  But I got a lot of sleep, which is unusual for me.  Good news:  when I went to doc for six month med check-up, he said nothing about weight loss.  Maybe that's bad news.  He said, "You look great."  Jesus, maybe I was fatter than I thought?  It don't matter for shit (I'm practicing using improper English in order to fit in at work), since I got my refill for six months.  Oh, and some sleeping pills.  Just a two week supply since he knows my addictive personality (I was stupid and told him the truth in the initial visit).  Sadie was pissed off at her momma earlier.  I decided it would be fun to paint her toenails with acid grape nail polish this morning.  Most of it ended up on me, my hands and my PJs.  She sulked for about 30 minutes and promptly forgot about it.  I suppose she was offended that I thought she was a poodle or something.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      ( Don't ask about the title.   I wrote that in a comment this past week, and now I can't get it out of my head.  Trying to think up more Dog Emotion Breeds but caffeine has yet to kick in.)   Question:   Is it okay to take Milk Thistle with champagne instead of water?  How about a vodka on the rocks?  Will my liver know the difference?   Saturday...aah.   The day of rest.   Yeah, right.  I'm going to try to color my hair in the next hour (I doubt I could pull off the Gwen Stefani color even though in my heart of hearts, I'm a platinum blonde), then off to work on straightening up my rat's nest of an office.  Go back a couple weeks and you will see that our executive coach   organized me  .  What she failed to mention is that this system  DOES NOT WORK  when you have serious lawsuit going on and five brokers breathing down your neck for due diligence items.  I am now three weeks behind and it only took two work weeks to accomplish that feat.  Who are these people that actually have time to get on ebay at work?  And where do they work?  I can't go in to work in pathetic hangover get-up that I normally would, since people will be working next door and let's face it, I'm vain.  Oh, fuck it, I'll probably just throw on some boxers and slick back my hair.  When have others ever stopped me from looking like shit on the weekend?  Or during the week, for that matter?  After work, I'll come home, look around in disgust because the house I cleaned on Monday looks like a war zone again.  And my home office needs reorganizing.  There is a fine layer of ashes on everything within two feet of my computer.  I'm sure that's really good for the damned thing, but hell, it ain't working too well these days anyway.  I'm looking at a new one.  Next, after fretting over mess, I'll start writing my business plan.   WTF?    Shouldn't non-boyfriend-with-MBA be doing this?   I didn't even graduate with my  undergrad  degree in  literature .  I guess playing this weekend with his son   is   more important, but damn it, I need those t-shirts ready before next Saturday!!!  Plus, he was a  little  condescending when he told me, "Chicken, you're approaching this business like you would approach shopping for your own clothes," and then proceeded to run down a laundry list of things-to-do-this-weekend.   All of which (and more) I had already designated as Saturday/Sunday tasks in my calendar.   Just because the outer trappings are blonde does not mean my brain is (unless vodka is called into question).  The conversation went something like this:   V:   First, you need to write your business plan.  Do you know how to do that?  I emailed an example to you today.   NG:  Uh, I wrote that down alrea...   V:   Then you need to determine how many shirts you'll have printed for your initial run.   NG:  I sent you that spreadsh...   V:   And of course, which sizes...   NG:   It's on that spr...   V:   And Chicken, you need to call R about the order, see if we can have it ready by Friday.   NG:   I talked to him and we can...   V:   Now, what do you need to do?  So I recited   my   original list (made without anyone's help, thank you) and I guess my tone was a little snarky so we changed the subject after brief lecture of seriousness of the above referenced matter.  Okay, so yes, it  is  his money that's funding it.  But it's my idea, my trademark, my company.   He's  the one who pushed this on me anyway.  To be fair, V is normally very sweet to me.  And he lets me get my own way, eventually, after working for it, which is very attractive in a male ( to me, at least ).  However, let this be for the record:   I don't ever want to work for him.   And sleeping with him doesn't help - he's  ruthless .  I thought I was the one to be a bitch with period due shortly?  The rest of the weekend will look like this (and I'm only telling you so you can envy my  dynamic  and  exciting  life):  Clean house  again  Do laundry  Drink with Fab D  Watch a movie or listen to music and dance ridiculously Fall asleep (aka, pass out) Wake up to  three hungry dogs  Follow Nico around to make sure he doesn't shit in the den again Watch movies and read magazines Eat the  third frozen pizza  of this weekend Have grandiose plans of making fabulous lunches to take to work next week, since I am broke after SWM  Fall asleep under three Min Pins and totally botch the entire plan   Then it's " Monday, back from the dead... "  Scottie must have had one of those weekends himself.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I was going to sit down and rewrite my shopping list before Vicente arrived, just so I'd have all the items grouped by type (hygeine, fresh food, frozen pizza, etc.).  Then I realized that I'm a loser if this is all I have to do, so I poured some champagne and read the new Lucky magazine.  Gwen Stefani is hot, goddamnit.  I envy her belly (actually,  lack of  belly).  Let's just assume she does more than 8 Minute Abs.  Back to the list...I worked with a girl once who loved making lists.  She was obsessive about it.  Mary/Lisa can vouch for this.  We'd be on break from horrible government job, drinking wine coolers in the cafeteria at three (I kid you not), and Stinky's wife would be making out lists.  Lowe's List, Home Depot List, Kroger List, Albertsons List (she didn't shop at Tom Thumb, my grocery store of choice), Weekend Gardening and Lawn List, Housecleaning List, Stinky To Do List, Home Office List, Pet List and Must Call This Week List.  Oh, and then she'd make a Master List of all above referenced lists.  What was  really scary  was when they went on vacation.  Ideas For Vacation List, Prices of Ideas For Vacation List, Vacation Budget List, Clothes Stinky And I Will Wear On Vacation List.  You get the idea.  She also had a Man Face and her hair had not changed in style since 1982.  I saw her three years ago...nope, still the same.  Maybe she was waiting for the style to come back?  It doesn't matter...I'm quite sure it didn't look good then, either.  Stinky got his name from something his wife-to-be (at that time) said about him.  I won't repeat it.  Just reinforced my reasons to turn him down when he asked me out three months before meeting Man Face.  I once gave Mary/Lisa a card with some Vikings choosing sides for volleyball on the front, and it said, "We don't want Stinky on our team!"  I think that was the same time that M/L laughed so hard she farted, and then laughed that much more.  I used to like lists when I was younger.  When I didn't really have anything to do.  Lists now infuriate me, since I don't ever typically complete all items on the list.  I think lists are counterproductive - I don't need another symbol of my failure to get anything done at work.  I have constant reminders of that already.  Wonder whatever happened to Stinky and Man Face?  I swear, if she ever got knocked up, she would have a Labor List.  If the doctor and Stinky get lucky, she'll be knocked out with a planned C-section.  Yeah,  list  this  !  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      BDJ, I want to know why?  I've lived in the DFW area (Dallas/Fort Worth to those of you who don't know) most of my life, leaving to live in other states but always coming back.  Perhaps that makes me boring, but I really love my hometown.  Compared to cities I've visited "up north," most of my fellow statespeople are a pretty friendly group.  However, we've been portrayed by fellow Americans (and foreigners as well) as dumb and/or ignorant, lazy, misogynistic (the men), gun-toting, right-wing idiots.  So I can see the fear and reluctance to visit our beautiful state (well,  parts  of it are).  Truth be told, yes, there are a lot of Texas (native or transplanted) who could be described by the first sentence of this paragraph, but there are a lot who are not.  And another truth for you:  the above described asshole-type can be found anywhere, from Dallas to L.A. to San Francisco, to Chicago and New York City, to the very southern tip of Florida (after all, where did Hemingway reside?), even to London.

      Doesn't everything, though?  "What's it taste like, man?  It looks weird."  "Oh, it tastes like, well, it tastes like chicken.   Just eat it , you pussy."   Happy hour is delayed until next Thursday , when I will inevitably have no $$$.  That's okay, I'm shopping at our new Super Wal-Mart after work (the life I lead causes envy in others, I just  know  it).  Today's events will allow me to physically watch my bank balance slide away.  Not sliding as in a gentle tear sliding down one's cheek, but sliding as in those avalanches you never want to get caught in.  Alas!  But I  will  have new fish, a very good thing.  I have 55 minutes to get ready and get my lazy, blogging ass out of here.  My boss decided to work from home, so guess what?  I have to drag my entire office down to Ovilla.  Still, it gets me out of that windowless cave and in the nice sunshine for at least an hour.  And I get to wear shorts and a t-shirt, too (and freeze my ass off).  It's good that I don't have windows in my office, at least it's good for my company.  I'm so easily distracted by all the "cute little squirrels and I got to watch them outside my window," that I'd forget I was at work, stop collating, and turn my CD player up to a less-than-reasonable volume from nine until eleven.  Since Ninsi put up her new, exhausting schedule, I thought I'd do the same for today.  However, my schedule is not exhausting, just involves a lot of driving:  7:15 - get ready for work, take makeup with me in case I don't finish 8:00 - leave to pick up Rx so I don't mow down someone on the way to boss' house 8:15 - Starbuck's (I'm hooked on chai tea) 8:25 - drive to office, gather up all my unorganized crap 8:35 - drive to boss' house 9:05 - she's wondering why I'm not early but should be used to this, as I've been on time three times in three years, and early four times 10:30 - hopefully leave for my own office 10:50 - get distracted by Payless, decide to look for sandals as I cannot afford cute Nine West sandals I've fallen in love with 11:15 - arrive at office facing 100 emails and about 25 voicemails (I'm changing my name, I swear) 12:15 - lunch! 1:30 - work (sigh) 2:45 - smoke break 2:55 - work (ugh) 5:30 - leave for SW & PetsMart 7:30 - arrive home to babies, fed by g'ma and watch a movie 10:00 - haul my happy ass into bed  Tomorrow morning - back to old schedule.  Shit.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I'm growing out my mop.  Right now, more compliments are being flung my way than ever before, and I don't understand it because I HATE MY HAIR.  I cut it myself a couple of times (could be why I loathe it) and it's in that in-between stage where I just mess it up in the A.M. and pretend to others that I really wanted it to look this way.  The color is wack, too.  I really need some champagne blonde in the mix.  Right now, it looks like Vitamin Pee Blonde # 94A instead.   Hair .  What the fuck?  Why are a bunch of dead skin cells so important?   Because it is, damn it .  If my hair looks like shit, then it "colors" the rest of my appearance.  I'm  pissed  when my hair looks bad.  I hate everyone when my hair is not right.  Including you.  Especially you.  My life sucks right now.  Basically because of PMS.  My tits feel like pounded chicken breasts (no pun intended), I'm bloated and I'm thinking injecting liquified Ding Dongs into my blood veins is a  good  idea.  Plus I am out of alcohol.  This makes for a grumpy Chicken even when she isn't expecting her period.  Fuck you.  Sorry, that just slipped out.  Now where was I?  Oh yeah, the  hair .  My hair is baby-fine, wispy hair that WON'T DO WHAT THE FUCK I WANT IT TO DO.  Ahem.  It just does its own thing.  Hairdressers (stylists, salon personnel,  whatever ) just  love  my hair.  "OH!  It's sooo fun to play with!"  Bite me, bitches.  It isn't "fun" when you have to "play" with it every morning.  When, if you use conditioner, it lies there limply, like a sorority girl on roofies (or however the fuck you spell it).  It isn't fun when it takes to color so quickly, Champagne Blonde turns to Translucent Shit in 20 minutes.  Oh, and try having a fucking cowlick.  Who the hell came up with that name, I ask you?  It does not look like a cow licked my head.  It looks as though some beaver with a hair fetish decide to gnaw on the back upper left portion of my skull.  I've considered shaving it all off, a la Sinead, but then I have this  dent  in my skull and I just don't want to fend off questions all day.  Jesus, you could pot a plant in that dent.  Explains a lot, now doesn't it?  I want hair that flows.  And thick eyelashes.  And big tits.  And a flat stomach.  Hell, yes, I wanna be Barbie.  My Barbie would be:  Histrionic Alcoholic Barbie...bags under eyes included.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I have books in stacks on tables and chairs and in baskets beside my bed and I really, really need to buy at least two more bookcases.  Thought I would try this at home (even though they warn you not to, kids), since my library here is a little better than at work.  Pick up the nearest book.  Open it to page 23.  Find the fifth sentence.  Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.  "The Age Of Grief" (Jane Smiley) ** this was made into a rather interesting movie, "The Secret Lives Of Dentists," by the way:  (Another disclaimer - there are short stories that precede the novella, "The Age of Grief," and this selection comes from "The Pleasure Of Her Company")  "'I've got Bryan's car.'"  YAWN.  Maybe this second experiment is a mistake?  "The Stories Of John Cheever":  (This comes from the short story, "The Common Day")  "He lived in a cottage on the place and his wife, who was now dead, had worked in the kitchen."  OKAY.  So this is not "Next Stop Wonderland" and I'm not finding jewels of inspiration in all of my randomly-open-book-and-point-finger-to-page-and-read-aloud-your-selection.  Maybe Patricia Cornwell will be more acquiescent.  From "The Body Farm":  "'Maybe they could do something with my grandson.'"  Never mind.  I FUCKING GIVE UP, part two.  I am thinking the problem lies with the page number.  Maybe 74 would be better.  Or 117.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I got this off a blog (maudnewton.com), who got it from someone else...  Pick up the nearest book.  Open it to page 23.  Find the fifth sentence.  Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.  Disclaimer:  My office is void of anything worth reading, so I went to our "library" and found "Twelve Steps To Self-Improvement":  "Melissa, known in her hospital ward as the "quiet nurse," was influenced by her family and Hispanic culture to be submissive and communicate only on special occasions."  BORING  So I grabbed the TAA's 2002-2003 Redbook, thinking  that  might be more exciting:  "The tenant's notice under Subsection (a) must be in writing only if the tenant's lease is in writing and requires written notice."   We live dangerously here in my office.   I thought, "Third time's a charm, right?" and decided that not only would I eat the tortilla from my taco instead of just eating the filling, I would also scrounge through my boss' personal "library" for reading material.  I found a rather fitting book, since I just started my own company, "The Five Temptations of a CEO" (What? Don't tell me one is " tempted to supply alcohol at your board meetings? "):  There were only two sentences on that page.  I FUCKING GIVE UP.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      It is not a good sign when you are going to pour more coke in your glass and something catches your eye - looks like a little critter of some sort got trapped in an ice cube.  Lovely.  You dump everything out, rinse, rinse, rinse again, and start over from scratch.  With a new glass.  You examine every ice cube, scrutinizing contents.  It's early, you're old, so your eyes are playing tricks on you.  Cautiously filling the glass with coke, you're afraid to take a drink.  Screw it, you'll just grab a chai tea on the way to work.  Okay, so I'm not  that  bad, I am drinking the coke.  But I did check out every cube.  My ice maker doesn't work so I buy ice by the bag (plus I like the smaller cubes better than what my freezer produces).  I've always just assumed the ice was clean; now I'm wary.  I hate being this way.  This is why I don't eat hamburgers and haven't for 20 years...an unfortunate incident involving a bite and then a glance at bitten burger.  Mary/Lisa feels the same way about burgers.  I'm often shunned in social settings when I take a bun, some cheese, add tomatoes, pickles, mustard and mayo, and I don't put a patty on it.  Years I've had to get used to being weird, so it doesn't really bother me anymore.  Now  this .  I wish I could be like other people and just eat whatever, but I'm not, never have been.  Could be a possible explanation for teenage eating disorder.  (You  think ?)  I have all sorts of interesting bruises on my ass and lower back.  It seems that the malade of the past weekend/Monday dehydrated me so that my skin got very, very dry.  And itchy.  Lotion, more lotion, I'm still itching.  And when I itch, I scratch.  I have no self-control.  So if you saw my ass, which you won't (I don't typically flash that pasty white thing out of respect for the unsuspecting), you might think I have leukemia.  God, I can't wait for swimsuit season!  (Insert sarcastic tone of voice here.)  And I was going to wear a bikini without fear this year...now I have the bruises to scare people off.  Last year, it was the fat.  Will I ever win?  No Sephora splurges this month.  Nico is yelping when I pick him up; vet appointment today at 3:30; $100 is my guess, since x-rays will be involved.  Ran out of EVERYTHING...Super Wal-Mart after happy hour on Thursday ($20)...estimated damages from trip to SW, where I will inevitably purchase many things I do not need:  $150.  Then I owe someone some money, have to pay that back ($300).  Plus doctor for me on Friday, after which I will need some Xanax since he will be alarmed at amount of weight lost in the last five months - $30 co-pay, hopefully only $10 for the X.  Dog food ($20), can't leave PetsMart without toys for the babies ($20), and new fish/bottom feeders/snails (I lost a  lot  due to unfortunate Ick episode one month ago) - $30.  I'm wondering where to budget necessities, like cigarettes, alcohol and eating out for lunch.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       GUILT ONLY GOES  SO  FAR   I always think that when I call in sick, the following day, I'll come in and be fired.  What is it about me that I refuse to give myself some time off?  It's a sickness, a mental illness.  V has absolutely no problem taking off.  One would think that after four years, some of this would have rubbed off on me, since I wasn't always this way.  Property management has poisoned my soul.  Every industry  has  to have a down time, and this one just  doesn't .  I have the ass and belly disease, for Chirst's sake!  I remember commercial real estate, and two hour lunches, shopping at North Park Mall.  And drinking jello shots in the parking garage with Stinky.  And two weeks at Christmas when  nothing  happened, except for me and Stinky looking up Twinkie recipes on the internet and pulling up pictures of big dicks by accident.  I remember leaving for three hours one afternoon, just to take Stinky over to the boys at FI (had yet to hook up with V) and doing those same jello shots in D's office.  When I arrived back at work, the guy who worked for my boss (my second in command) called me into his office.  Shit, I thought I was going to get fired.  All he said was this:  "B, I don't often tell you how much I appreciate all the things you do for us."  Damn, I'm taking three hour alcohol breaks more often.   BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY   The babies were unleashed today, naked and free, living a bohemian life with their wanna-be-hippie mama.  Okay, so I took their collars off, that's all, but they were as free as the wind and we might as well have been at Woodstock.  Except for instead of Ravi, it was Norah, and I must have tripped too much, because all I did all day was sleep and eat macaroni and cheese.  Since I felt good enough to work for about two hours, but still worried about being contagious, I was glad to have the chance to be at home, quiet and reflective, during a typical work day, with no one around.  Now I DON'T FUCKING WANNA GO BACK TO WORK.   All play and no work makes for one happy Cheeken.    LET'S HAVE IT EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS   My glass is making Olympic circles of sweat on my desk right now.  They should really come up with Alternative Olympics...you know, Most Hours Wasted Surfing Porn, Most Drinks In One Weekend Without Dying, Most People You've Slept With That You Cannot Name, etc.  I know a few people (myself  excluded ) who could "make the team."  If this idea catches on, remember - you heard it  here  first.   SOMETHING OUT OF PULP FICTION,  OR  KILL BILL   This is  strange :  my non-BF and my ex-BF wanted to hook up for drinks while current non-BF is doing business in Pittsburgh tonight.  I said, NO WAY MUTHAFUCKAHS to both of them.  Okay, so I really told them both, No, are you  crazy ?  I could just see it - they'd actually  like  each other and I'd have no recourse but to kill them both.  Otherwise, it'd be all chit-chat about how fucking grumpy I am in the a.m., how I have "hydration issues," and "dunno, can't she be a bitch when she doesn't get her own way?"   Nothankyousir , I am  not  having any of  that .  It would be like me wanting to have high tea (haha, more like happy hour) with Gwen or Wendy.  Put  that  into your pipes and smoke it, boys!  Turn-about is fair play.  And I doubt either of you would enjoy  that  notion.  Touche.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I wonder if the author of the blog "Embrace Spontaneity" ever goes back and edits their posts?  Chicken must be feeling better.  It's a miracle, but you can actually  see  the surface of my dining room table.  Well, part of it.  It's a work in progress.  I must be sick if I'm  choosing  to clean, rather than being forced to do so because I have company coming over who have yet to witness the laziness that is inherent in me.  At least I'm cleaning and not e-shopping, which is what landed me in the red again.  Grrr, but I just  had  to have that tarte cheek stain.  Simply because I don't have enough fucking beauty products.  Shit, this weekend, I will have to purchase a corner wall cabinet for the unnecessary products lining the walls and counters and any empty space available in my tiny, tiny bathroom.  You know, they say Americans were thinner in the 1950s, that our portion sizes have  tripled , and I can believe it.  My house, circa 1959, was made for very slender folks.  Who didn't own a lot of clothes.  Hey, at least they were still putting hardwood floors under ugly carpet back then.  The deciding factor:  45 year-old hardwood floors in great condition, along with a huge backyard for my fat Sparkster to run in (bless his soul).  I was smoking crack when I made that decision.  I hate house and yard work.  Basically, I'm just waiting on someone else to get tired of the mess and do it for me.  For close to four years, it's worked for the most part.  Knock on wood.  I'm playing this next song, dedicated to Pisser:  "Lukenbach Texas" - feeling homesick?  Yeah, well  neither would I .  I was reading back through some of your archives and there  are  a few men here who don't wear boots and hats.  Ones who aren't gay, even.  I think they're all transplants but what the hell.  And SA is the 7th fattest city in America?  It's all those fucking flour tortillas and chips-and-salsa on every fucking table, even if it isn't a Tex-Mex restaurant.  I always get my bean & rice & cheese and/or fish tacos on corn tortillas, then eat the filling.  Weird, I know.  My parents are probably lying when they say I was born in Dallas.  I just don't get the "fixin", either.  I stopped saying that about 22 years ago.  Still, my absolute favorite meal is my mom's pinto beans, fresh corn on the cob, off-the-vine tomatoes, cornbread, sharp cheddar cheese and cantaloupe plus watermelon plus honeydew melon for dessert.  And  unsweetended  iced tea (another anomaly, I know).  "Country cooking" is what my dad likes to call it, or "real food."   DEPENDS  On Who You Ask  I can't stop peeing.  Yes, I am supposed to be rehydrating my dehydrated body, but Jesus, I'm peeing every ten minutes.  I'm afraid to sneeze, that might cause me to inadvertently piss myself.  Won't the dogs be laughing then?  Pointing and laughing.  I know I would.  I hope Vicente doesn't get my, as he puts it, "malade imaginaire."  Imaginaire, my ass, literally.  Talk to the butt because the hand isn't listening.  At least the damned fever broke.  Finally.  At 2:45 p.m. today.  Sorry, I am sure you are rather sick of ass-talk.   Grouchy   While reading Timmy's blog, I clicked on one of his links and was redirected to a blog that is second in its ability to Pisser's to make me laugh so hard it hurts.  It's the second one.  Who the hell can resist a pirate?  Come to think of it, where did all the pirates go?  I mean, we still have ships.  I think it would be cool if pirates started taking over ships off the Barbary Coast again.  Hell, I don't even know where the fuck the Barbary Coast is, but I read it once in a book.  If you are a pirate, is the automatic pet of choice a parrot?  Could one have a Siamese cat?  Finches?  A meerkat?  How come you never saw  those  animals in pirate movies?  Myself?  I would have a hedgehog.  In fact, I might buy one right now even though my career switch to being a pirate is years off.  Still, I'd probably emasculate the poor thing by naming him Percy or some shit.   Starch Fest '04   sponsored by Jenny Craig   Tickets are long gone, folks, but here's what went down...first of all, a question:  Is it possible to die from eating too many starchy foods in any given 24-hour period?  That is, if you are not diabetic, just ass and belly disabled?  My Grandma Meal this morning started off with an entire pouch of pseudo mashed potatoes.  Not all at once, you git, I  can  show  some  restraint.  It's just that I was  hungry  after not eating for a day (a real Ghandi, I am).  Later on in the day, I had yogurt.  Then I made some mac and cheese.  I ate part of it then, piping hot.  Went back for more an hour later.  Then more yogurt.  Now, how could it be, I just polished off the remainder of the mac?  Surprisingly, I didn't lick the bowl clean (at least not that  you  know of).  Tonight, if ass and belly allow it, I will be eating a frozen cheese pizza.  I feel like a wasted shopping trip lies behind me as I try to squeeze my ever-widening, starchy fat ass into new skinny pants.  Oh well.  (Add to that I had at least 24 oz. of coke and three small glasses of milk.  Pig.)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      is pretty shitty today, according to Vicente.  He's driving through a mountain right now in a four-door Impala.  Now he's crossing the fabulous river, whatever river that is.  Cold, rainy, lots of riverboats.  There are all these people walking around in these huge overcoats (possibly Gortex, since I like saying that word).  Vicente doesn't have an umbrella and brought a light, waterproof jacket since he left his heavy one at my house.  Now he's lost.  V says Pittsburgh reminds him of Cincinnati, Ohio.  He once lived in Ft. Wright, KY, so he had the wonderful opportunity to visit that lovely city a few times.  He finally found the hotel, no time for lunch.  Poor V...but then again, he'll go out to eat tonight and tomorrow night, and I'll be snacking on old-people-foods.  I'm hoping like hell that he gets the account in Chicago, since I've never been and could probably rope him into letting me tag along.  And God, if there's any chance for a NYC or Beantown hookup, I'm so there.  Signing off, as I'm spending the rest of my sick day working...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Why the  hell  do I always feel guilty when I'm not at work due to illness?  Why do I feel the need to go into  detail  about my malade?  Does anyone really care as long as I don't infect them with my funk?  And  no , I do  not  call in sick when I am hungover, I just go in and make everyone else suffer.  What I thought to be food poisoning obviously wasn't so, as I have not been able to have a happy feeling in my abdominal and nether regions since.  I slept all day long today (well, Sunday), couldn't sleep last night (Saturday).  And trust me (like any of you would be  this  stupid), do not eat spaghetti if you are not feeling well.  It certainly has an unpleasant taste coming back up.  My stomach MUSCLES are sore from this insanity.  And I missed seeing my non-BF, who will be in Pittsburgh in seven hours, for two days, then he's off to Cali this weekend to see his son.  And you think I'm bitchy  now ?  Wait until this time next weekend, when I haven't been laid in a while.  Grrr.  I checked for an email from Bunny instructing me on how to post on her site because I am clueless about these things.  And as for clueless, as far as my business is concerned, my non-BF and older bro have sort of taken over and have been having phone calls that don't include me.  Not that it concerns me because I trust them both, but  I'M  the nongirlfriend.  I guess I wouldn't understand what they were talking about anyway (they get off on these programming tangents that I fail to follow but probably could if it interested me in any way at all, which it doesn't).  I'll stick to writing and shopping, two things I am slightly good at.  I decided to do things in a backwards way, since backwards is my favorite direction.  For twenty days following Easter (don't think I can make it for 40), I will giving up the items/lifestyle choices below:   *  alcohol (don't laugh - besides, I don't think my stomach can take it for a while)  *  laziness (I actually cleaned my house somewhat this weekend, in between trips to the toilet)  *  cussing (okay, now you  can  laugh, because I just can't do that)  *  chocolate (easy to do since I don't eat it anyway, and I really wanted three items on my list)  All of you out there who do drink, please take turns binging for me during this time, as I am concerned about the fiscal state of the alcohol industry.  Vodka, you're gonna have to survive without me for a while.  Don't worry Phillip Morris - I'm not abandoning you just yet.  When I'm home sick from work, I typically prolong it by trying to work from home and answering the 15,498,773 calls I receive in a normal day.  Tomorrow (today, whatever), I think I'll be too dizzy to talk.  I actually am pretty dizzy at the moment, but if all you've had for 40 hours is coke and one bowl of pseudo mashed potatoes, you would be, too.  I'm just hoping the faux spuds remain headed in the right direction.  Others before have had the tendency to, ah,  rebel .  I do have about 43 magazines I could catch up on (however, last fall's fashion might be a little tired by the time I get around to looking at it).  Just now, as I got up to get more coke (I know, it's hard on your stomach, but at least it stays down 75% of the time), I felt the stirrings of a revolution below.  Those potatoes are beginning to get feisty and I fear this will be a long, long night.  *****  Vicente Stats  Number of times he said, "You're a  wacko " this weekend - 53 Number of times he told me, "You're going to a mental institution" - 27 (and this was just over the phone)  *****  One last comment before I'm off to take the eighth bath of the day:  I have the most understanding non-BF.  Just now, on the refrigerator, I noticed the employment ad he cut out for me three years ago when I was laid off..."Girls Girls Girls, 18+, up to $500 a day!"  Nice.

      I'd probably spend my last dollar on lipgloss and dog food.  Except that I don't know any dog food that is that cheap, and the lip gloss, well, forget it.  Might as well smear Vasoline on my lips and be done with it.  Ick.  I wanna know what the Pez in Pez Dispenser stands for.  Did anyone ever really  like  those candies that popped out of the mouth?  Do you know that my mother gave me one for Christmas one year?  I'm serious.  But it really was one of my fave gifts.  Along with those Jelly Belly earrings Vicente gave me the same year.  Whoa.  Heh, I was supposed to start laundry (check), fold laundry (hmm), clean kitchen (huh?) and bathrooms (whatever) this morning.  Instead, I decide to wake up half the people I know and, at the same time, piss them off.  If  I  have to be wide awake from 4:30 on, they need to get their lazy asses out of bed, too.  Seriously, I only called two people (one of the two, I called three times, and she finally answered with, "God, you  really  don't want me to sleep late, do you?").  Mary is my BF (best friend, not to be confused with my BF, boyfriend/non-boyfriend); like she said, if she was pissed off about my "early morning phone calls," she wouldn't have answered the phone.  Hey Vicente - Zach Malloy will be at the Guitar Fest or whatever-the-fuck-they-call-it that we went to that one time!  Feel like standing in the rain with eight other people, including that ass "down front" who was clearly pissing off ZM with his hair-band-fist-waving and shouting out the title to the one song of Z's he actually knew?  I felt slightly outnumbered that day - 27 men to every 1 woman.  And about 2% of them datable.  I was with the 1% - could never quite pin down other datable guy.  No need, as V is as good as it gets most of the time.  Plan for Saturday, rainy Saturday in Big D...well, I'm going later this afternoon to look at Mary's house that she wants to buy.  That's about it for excitement until tonight.  I may finish cleaning (don't bet on it) and actually put some makeup on so I don't frighten the neighborhood children.  (I think they already think I'm a witch anyway.)  Do you know what I'd  really  like to do, though?  God, and I haven't done this in  years , but I want to just get in my truck and   drive  .  When I first learned to drive some TWENTY FUCKING YEARS AGO (good God!), I would purposely get "lost" and find my way back home.  This is how I know all the shortcuts and back roads in Dallas now.  Sometimes, my friend T (who accompanied me to the Prince concert last weekend) and I would go; sometimes, I would fly solo.  I stopped doing this for a while in my 20s, while I was married the first time and during the post-first-divorce time, when I was too hungover to think.  I drove a lot when I was married to my bipolar, psycho second husband, only to escape having to be in the same room with him.  Then another post-divorce period, during which I probably drove, but drove drunk.  This Chicken has some pretty interesting stories to tell, believe me.  Now that Ol' Red is back up to par and I'm not afraid of death-by-vehicle anymore, I may start the Sunday night drives again.  Sober, of course.  Seven years ago (give or take), I wrote an essay about this very subject, one that brought one reader "to tears" (Christ, it's about driving around in my car, you fuckwit).  I should publish it here, except it's already copyrighted through my writing-group-at-the-time, Lush (would you have expected any other name???).  I remember Lush's publication party in Austin, back in the day when we were all single and I had my eye on that blonde-haired boy and we all drank far too much.  I passed myself off as Harvey's wife THREE TIMES because I kept losing my room keycard.  I doubt I pronounced his name correctly even  once  that evening.  H and B were playing piano in the lobby bar until they threw us out.  And K&H almost killed someone by knocking their beers off the ledge (we were on the top floor) to the courtyard below.  The next morning, I woke up next to the guy all the girls wanted but could never have, and I thought, "Oh YES!"  Looking down, seeing my body fully clothed, I realized I was not a goddess then, but maybe someday.  Good, good times.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Mary/Lisa and I went to visit Hilda yesterday.  She and her husband are redoing the floors in their new house, and I think the amount of carpet fuzz I inhaled was probably more than one person should.  No wonder she's sick.  I wake up today at 4:00 a.m. with a sore throat and congested sinuses.  H is hyper like I am, cannot sit still.  She's buzzing around the house, talking, apologizing for it not being clean (like  that  sort of thing offends me).  I eyeball her capris, thinking that they look a little too familiar, but I did not yet experience this frosty blue color.  Of course, I inquire where she purchased the pants and she replied, "The Limited."  Well, that makes sense.  They resemble my Editor capris from Express, but where was this fabulous blue when  I  was shopping?  I'm lost now, having this out of body experience, mentally creating outfits at Express (I even know which dressing room at The Parks I'm using), when Mary/Lisa jars me back to the here and now.  "She's our kind of girl, Bren."  Seems that H, sick and not feeling up to laundry, went to the mall and bought enough outfits to get her through the work week until she could do laundry this weekend.  And the pants she was wearing?  They still had the tag on them.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I've always wondered where that phrase came from.  Usually, when I'm waiting for someone to come to my house for a prearranged meeting, I'm  sitting around  waiting, not  standing .  And if they do not show, I'm slightly  down , not  up .  So that phrase just really doesn't make any sense to me.  ANYWAY...  It would be nice if Fab D would call me to let me know why a call at 7:15 this evening from her saying she'd be over in a little while, she just had to drop off her niece and nephew, turned into 10:00 p.m. and no Fab D.  Not that I'm majorly disappointed, mind you.  I ate my mom's Mexican food (which really isn't Mexican food, but a watered-down version of Tex-Mex, but that's what I grew up eating, sans the meat, so I'm used to it, or so I tell myself).  This means only one thing will occur in the following three to four hours:  I will vomit.  No, I'm  not  bulimic; this was projectile vomiting of the worst sort, and it  killed  my throat.  Plus, my stomach is empty again and I'm afraid to put anything on it.  So I really would just rather take a bath and go to bed, but the minute I do that, the doorbell will ring.  I am starting to feel like an Offspring song, thinking I should just turn my porch light out.  Honey, I am  not  Motel 6.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Received most recent Sephora purchase today:  1) tarte cheek stain trio ("tickled", "puttin' on the glitz" and "flush") - makes my cheeks sticky and a little goes a long way...think I will like it better next time (won't apply so much) but I'm sure I'll need to use loose powder (five minutes later and it's finally dry, sort of)  2) Urban Decay Eye Shadow in "Sin" - perfect compliment to...  3) Urban Decay Eye Shadow in "Strip" - both Sin (light pinkish, almost nudey) and Strip (grey with shimmer) are subtle, much more so than "Oil Slick" (black with silver glitter, but goes on almost a midnight blue) but I think all three will work well together  4) Sephora Super Shimmer Lip Gloss in "think pink" - perfect! reminds me of high school lip gloss in regards to the sheen, but with a more "adult" color...wonderful scent  This post is for Pisser, who misses the makeup reviews FHB and I were doing.  P, if it takes a few more trips to Sephora.com to make you happy, I'll gladly go shopping some more.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Hello...this is Jezebel in hell.  Thought I'd start our holy weekend out the right way.  Heh.  Vicente and I were discussing Maundy Thursday and it went right into a religious discussion and a debate about the usage of the word "fungible."  Then we moved on to the business I'm starting and it got all serious and  real  conversation, which I am not used to with V.  Not that we don't talk about serious things, it's just more fun sparring.  (Ask Mary/Lisa about last night...all we did was spar at the bar...and I think they were going to refuse us service there towards the end of the evening.)  Thank you, cute-Justin-who-wants-to-be-a-firefighter, for the free crab cakes with crawfish sauce.  I have today off, yet I am going into the office to fucking work.  One particular property I will not name has caused me to be WAY behind on all other projects.  I just need to go in today to find my desk.  This will have to be after first NG meeting at noon, as I think my bed is beckoning me.  The babies are beckoning me, too, but all they want is the cheese pizza I'm having for bfast.  They have absolutely no loyalty for their momma.  (Actually, they do, as V was spanking me before he left for being a Bad Chicken, and Sadie and Nico became upset about that.)  Aren't days off  great ?  I mean, when they're days you don't  normally  take off (i.e., Saturday and Sunday)?  I turn into the biggest teenager and just do me-me-me stuff, like shoveling cheese pizza in my mouth, sleeping until 11, wearing stupid outfits and watching movies that make no sense.  Then the real world beckons and I have to wash clothes, pay bills, worry about health/money/mortgage payments/etc.  Ick.  For Timmy, my farts stink as badly (or possibly more) than yours do.  I was just making a joke about the Rosebud Salve.  For Pisser, my non-BF loves you.  He has this thing about redheads.  I should have never shown him your picture.  May I please borrow your meerkat?  For Mary/Lisa, it's cool.  Drunk dial my non-BF any time you want to.  He probably will put his hand down his pants for you.  He thinks you're cute!  For Fab D, I don't want anyone to know I was wearing those pants without underwear.  I'm unsettled enough as it is that you saw my Black Forest.  For Bunny, God, what the hell happened to you?    I miss you!!    For myself, go to bed already, you twit.  It's your day off.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      In which Big Bird confesses his true sexual orientation, Cookie Monster goes to OA, Oscar takes Anger Management classes, and we all learn to count to ten.  Do you know how very difficult it is to type when you are drunk?  (I almost typed "frunk" if that tells you anything)  Soooooo happy the non-BF is back.  Major make-out kisses and longing stares.  This is more fun than Monopoly, I tell ya.  And I don't even have to charge admission to get a kick out of it.  Paddy and Vicente are watching "Seinfeld" in the other room.  V thinks I'm insane to give out my phone number to drunk girl at Pappadeaux.  I say, what the fuck?  It's a  GIRL , for Christ's sake!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      BUNNY:  Stop firing people and  POST !  I'm truly sorry about the recent outage of internet access, FHB.  I look forward to yours and Pisser's posts the most, and now I'm only getting 50%.  Pisser  did  catch the slack with an amazingly funny entry today, however.  Is this weird, or am I?  (Don't answer that)  My right big toe seems to get all dried out faster than the left big toe.  What the hell is up with that?  Right now, I'm rubbing Rosebud Salve into my right big toe like I'm chanting for Krishna.  I love Rosebud Salve.  Fab D gave me some months ago for whatever-the-hell-reason (the best reason of all!) and I use it all the time.  It's made with Borax, which kind of frightens me, but hell, I slap it on all the same.  Now my right big toe smells like  roses .  Ah.  My farts smell like roses, too, by the way.  Buzzy is all buzzing about, acting like he has to pee.  Pardon me while I let the dogs out...aren't dogs funny?  Here comes Rainman/Buzzy, who is staring out into space then turning to me to lick my calves.  His sister, Sadie, is buried deep somewhere under some sort of cover, and Nico is watching TV with my brother.  I'm not lying, he  watches  it.  It's weird.  I have been abandoned by friends and boyfriend (non-boyfriend/investor) alike, so you  all  have to suffer.  Pisser, if I could make Buzzy into a man, I'd send him your way,  he won't stop licking !!!  Can I ask you this. PK?  What is your fascination with ass?  Is it the same as mine?  Just curious.  Don't feel the need to explain.  I feel major boredom approaching.  This is not good.  This MB usually leads Chicken down the path of self-destruction.  Someone send me a  People  magazine before I stray...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Just got home and it's eight o'clock already.  Left work at six, drove to see the girls who do my toes and fingers.   Bunny, they used the illegal razor thing on me!   LOVE sitting in that vibrating chair but it makes my double chin wiggle so much that I resemble a turkey.  Toe shade:  silver with glitter.  Finger shade:  solar nails that have grown too far out so I did silver tips and a white line dividing the pink and silver.  Decided the pink with white line look was just not ghetto enough.  I could have been even tackier and requested gold tips.  However funny it might have been at the time, I do have my dignity.  When I'm sober.  V is still in Tulsa.  Which is good, because we had this manager meeting today, and one District Manager decided it would be fun to play Pass The Apple using no hands, only our necks.  It was as if I had several hickies there for a while (V would have loved to have been a spectator).  And we had to do it  outside .  Our residents probably thought it was a lesbian love fest, and the men were probably calling their friends telling them to move in.  I wonder how one says, "Girls making out!" in Spanish?  Thank God (and Jesus) I have Good Friday off.  (Will I go to hell for writing that?  I think God and his gang have a sense of humor.)  Friday will be Housecleaning Day.  For all of two hours, then I'll get distracted and watch a movie in my underwear.  Wish I had the $$$ to hire someone to do it for me.  Unlike some people I know, I do NOT feel guilty if someone is cleaning my house while I am there.  I feel like Carol Brady.  Only I don't have to put up with Sam and a gay husband.  And six fucking brats.  (Hey, could  you  have lived with Marsha Brady?  So cut me some slack.)  Can you imagine what  The Brady Bunch  would have been like if it were conceived today?  Pisser asked me how I got back down to my fighting weight/size (since I don't weigh myself, it's counter-productive and somewhat depressing).  I stopped eating meat.  I do sometimes eat fish, but I'm starting to feel guilty about that.  This was a decision based upon my feelings for the animals, not to lose weight.  That just happened.  And I did not cut out bread or dairy products...I eat frozen pizza all the time, just ask Mary/Lisa and Fab D.  I also started eating several small meals a day and I swear to you,  it works .  Plus, when I'm frustrated, I've stopped going outside to huff and puff my life away (well, not as much); I started eating carrots.  Lots and lots of raw carrots.  My mother had me believing there for a while that if I ate too many, my skin would look jaundiced.  This is not surprising, since I once fell for "'Gullible' isn't in the dictionary," at which time I ran to get mine and said, "Oh, yes it is!"  I'm smart, but I'll believe just about anything you tell me.  (God, I'm opening up a can of worms with that statement.)  As FHB likes to say, I had a recent MACquisition the other day:  Lip Glass.  Mmmmmm.  I got the tinted one, after a co-worker raved about it.  "Greed" and Lovechild" - gave "Greed" to Mary/Lisa as a Happy Tuesday gift.  Still waiting on Sephora shipment to round out my Urban Decay eyeshadow colors.  When is glitter  too much glitter ?  I have yet to find out.  Perhaps when satellites can spot me from outer space, I will tone it down.  Right now, I'm going for the Slut Look.  Hey, remember when ads used to say "kohl" liner?  Do they still?  What the fuck is "kohl" anyway?  Is it the predecessor to Kohl's department stores (what I consider to be an overpriced Target but oh well)?  Is it pseudo-coal, and we're supposed to be so impressed with their play on words?  I am  honestly  asking  someone  out there to explain kohl to me, as it relates to makeup.  I'm far too lazy to Google it.  I read something rather interesting in the December or January issue of  Glamour  while I was getting my feet scraped.  Get this:  a woman who drinks only once a week, but at that one time throws back three or four drinks, ends up with more abdominal fat and a higher risk of heart disease than the fucking LUSH who partakes in one drink every night?  Okay, first of all, where the hell did they find someone who drinks  daily , but only has  one drink ???  In a world called "Wishful Thinking"?  This is how I see it boiling down:  (1) weekend "social" drinkers (they think calling it social makes it not-so-bad) - eight or nine or ten drinks per weekend, ending up sloshed and having sex with some guy they would never give the time of day while sober; (2) teetotalers - eeew, alcohol, I might have  fun !; (3) functional alcoholics - love to drink, never lost job/car/career/family/pets over it, though; and (4) plain ol' garden variety alcoholic - give it up, it's either AA or skid row for ya, babe.  So I don't really know where they came up with this study, and what pods they chose to participate.  "Bartender, pour me another, will ya?"  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Fab D is on her way over right now...we're celebrating.  I did not want to share my weight loss goal with anyone until (IF) I achieved it, and I did.  Whee!  After 11 long years, I'm back.  (Momma never really left you, baby...she was just "visiting" those other sizes)  That in and of itself calls for a celebration.  Hell, for me,  Tuesdays  call for a celebration but what the fuck?

      In San Antonio this weekend, while Vicente was sleeping and I was frustratingly AWAKE, I watched "Rain Man" for the first time (I've seen about 10 minutes, total, before).  It became increasingly apparent that Dustin Hoffman and Buzzy are somewhat similar, but different as well:  They both hold their heads the same way I would imagine that if Buzzy could speak, he would answer questions, "Yeah" Buzzy is not really a K-Mart kind of guy, but neither is Raymond at the end of the movie Buzzy never wears underwear at all, and it never upsets him Loud noises bother Buzzy, too I sometimes catch him staring at the wall like it's the most  fascinating  thing he's ever seen Buzzy doesn't know any of the answers to "Jeapordy" but can give a good growl when you're eating  So now Buzz-Bo's new nickname is Dustin, Rain Main for short.  See?  He's doing it again right now.  He's staring off into space, more so than a "normal" dog.  Buzzy also walks backwards a lot, but I failed to see DH do this.  Perhaps I missed an important part of the movie.  Today was one of those I-wish-I-had-taken-the-day-off-because-the-good-mood-I- was -in-when-I-woke-up-quickly-dissipated days.  (a) I forgot important assignment and had to work all day on just that, (b) my boss was in a fowl mood, and she's not even a Chicken, (c) remnants from the Hellish Weekend of Stomach Despair still lingered, (d) Edgar gave me the finger while on smoke break and (e) I discovered a new obsession - black bean tacos at the Cabana (I eat the filling only, because my life seems to be a carb-fest anymore).  I totally did not want to work, I wanted to play out in the sunshine, go to a park, feed some ducks, get chased by geese, swing on a swing.  Instead, I'm sitting in a window-less office, wondering what the fuck I am doing.  If  I  ran an office, there would be windows  everywhere , and I wouldn't care if for two hours of the day, my employees spent their time gazing outside.  It's good for your soul.  Must be why I don't have one anymore, after three years of a window-less cell.  Don't get me wrong, I like my job.  I just need some more sunshine and much less artificial lighting.  Vicente is off to exciting Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I shouldn't knock Tulsa, since I've never visited.  And never really think I'll want to.  I lived in Oklahoma for all of nine months and honey, that was enough for me.  Right now, I am jealous of Dianarchy - she's moving to one of my all-time favorite places, Boston.  The people aren't that friendly (ask me someday about my sociological experiment during one trip to Boston) but the city is full of history, and God, a highbrow part of town built on a landfill??  It's almost like Hutchins meets Manhattan with the ocean and without that damned prison that scares me every time I drive by.  V is also traveling to fabulous Pittsburgh, PA.  One city I almost moved to, but upon visiting, decided against it.  He keeps threatening to have drinks with my "boyfriend," who is really an ex-boyfriend.  I doubt that would be any type of "happy hour."  I also doubt that will be a business trip he incorporates a visit from me into.  Where is FHB?  I know you are having internet issues, but I miss your posts!!!  Hurry back.  As for the title, well, this is what it means:  Buzzy has it down pat.  His world consists of eating, sleeping, lying in the sun and shitting.  And the world works well for him that way.  Maybe it's time to simply  my  life?

      UNproductive evening, fortunately.  I don't have the wherewithall to do anything, just sit and watch a movie and play with my dogs.  Turned out to be a fabulous evening.  And  no , I did  not  watch "Donnie Darko" again.  Here are the five things (phrases, whatever) I love to hear the most:  1) "Hellllloo,   Chicken  !"  2) "Oh,  gosh !  Did you know this was  on sale !?"  3) My mother and father saying "I love you" to me, or each other  4) The babies barking when I come home from work  5) Have you lost weight??

      Well, not only am I handicapped today (bad thumb, can barely type), so is my niece.  It seems she did not break her arm, she shattered the joint that connects the humerus to the ulna.  Not good.  She's in surgery right now, not sure about mobility, etc., once she's healed.  Like I said earlier, it could be a lot worse.  Poor Caity.  I'm wondering what other starchy foods I can eat today.  So far, I've had mashed potatoes, an ear of corn and some nasty mac and cheese.  I was desperate, no food (at least none that remained in my digestive tract) for 26 hours.  I was beginning to hallucinate that I was actually enjoying working on boring tax financial statements.  I think perhaps a frozen cheese pizza will top the day off well.  Throw in a regular coke and all those black and white M&Ms I just ate, I ought to be well on my way to having an ass again, Vicente.

      We're back from SA...I'm too tired to write so suffice it to say it was a fabulous weekend.  I ate too much and did not drink  nearly  enough.  Okay, so I  will  write.  Of course, it wouldn't be a road trip without V trying to get me to spar with him and going one step too far.  And I, idiot that I am known to be about men, fall for it every time.  Now we're doing the silent thing again.  I shouldn't even write about it here because two days from now, I'll be all Vicente-is-the-most-wonderful, blah, blah, blah.  So let's take this part of the post as a "vent" and not take it seriously, since I always change my mind.  Anyway, the Curse Of Travel has struck me  again .  Goddamnit, what the hell is it about me leaving the DFW area, even if for only one farking day, only to return to a sick dog?  How many times has this happened, and as Donnie Darko asked, "When will this end?"  I have a business trip in May, one that will last abour five days, and I'm wondering which baby will be sick when I get back.  Actually, in all fairness, this has happened only three times.  Sparky was an exception, as he was born ill and it just so happened that he got that bad lymphatic infection while I was in Niagara Falls.  Then there was another trip where I came home to him limping (not a big deal, but you don't know how neurotic I was about that dog, well,  some  of you do).  Now I return from an  overnight  trip this afternoon, for God's sake, and Nico is acting funny.  When I picked him up, he yelped.  I'm hoping that he only scrapped a little too roughly with his sister, but I'll keep an eye on him.  Paddy Mac said he did that last night, too.  My babies...I could  never  have children.  I'd end up with three Woody Allens, I'm so wacked about them.  Did not get to pass out my shirts, as two days is a pretty short turnaround time for anyone, even a pro.  Meant to graffitti SA bathrooms but forgot my Sharpies and, really, we were having too much fun to remember to buy any.  Had dinner with Veronica, Bryce and their three children (very well-behaved, very handsome family).  Charisma kinda took to me and we had the longest conversation at Pappadeaux about the "shiny moon" and which fish on the walls were "mean" and which ones were "nice."  We shopped before dinner and then listened to a jazz band play in the courtyard at P's.  They played one of my all-time faves, "The Wave."  And we all played the Alphabet Game at the table.  God, I love other people's children!  Yes, the moon was shiny, my heart was shiny, and I didn't even have anything mind-altering to make it all that way.  I should have ended it right there.  Folks, here's a warning to all boys who date histrionic types:  Christ, just keep the shit to yourself after two days together.  Or take the meds I'm taking and we'll both be even.  I was really well-behaved this weekend, unfortunately.  On the one hand, I didn't feel like having cocktails last night (the crab cakes were forming a mutinous crew below, and I was fearing vomit).  On the other, I just didn't want to ruin the  fabulous  mood I was in.  At least, not until Sunday afternoon.  God, Vicente was in such a sweet, romantic mood.  He  did  hurt my feelings when he told me I have "no ass," and so I got new clothes out of the deal (his payback for commenting on my flat Mac butt, one that is genetic and, for that, I cannot help it).  I would think he would like the idea of a small ass but no, I guess I need to be JLo or something (urgh).  I'm a white girl.  I have a white girl's ass.  Deal with it.  (The two new pairs of pants, two skirts, two rings and two pairs of earrings he bought me were fab, though.  I'm waiting for more comments on my derriere.  And more clothes.)  FUCKING INSOMNIA.  As usual, I could not sleep well away from the mother land.  I think I got, all together, about three hours of sleep last night.  I kept waking up (and waking V up, as well) by yelling out in my sleep.  Dreams consisted of everyone I know being killed, and Dobermans barking in my ear, and viral epidemics that wipe out entire cities.  It was horrific.  And then  I was one cranky girl this morning.  Probably didn't help that I felt that way when V told me next weekend's Austin trip did not involve me.  I always overreact.  I hope Phlome's bday bash was just that, a bash, a wild wonderful bash.  I want to see photos, especially if anyone was misbehaving.  I hope Bunny is doing better.  I also hope Bunny and Pisser don't chide me about deleting posts, as I am already in enough trouble as it is.  San Antonio, what a town.  I've heard the social life there sucks (from W) and that I'm better off staying in Big D.  Damn, I wish our "leaders" would get their shit together and make downtown Dallas a better place to be.  I doubt that the Trinity River Project is going to help.  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      I feel sorry for the poor guy who works at the dry cleaners behind my house.  Snarky Sadie barks the most shrill, obnoxious bark at him every time he goes outside to smoke a cigarette.  She also has selective hearing and cannot hear me when I call her inside or tell her "no," but let me say "Uncle Vicente is here" and she'll come running.

      Apparently, Mary and I were busy little beavers at Pappadeaux last night.  (That first sentence ought to get some hits on Google.)  I received a snippy phone call from Ex in PGH who should be flattered that we thought of him while doing shots.  Non-BF received a call (booty call), as did E.  Who the hell knows what I said to him.  It is now an unwritten rule that I am not allowed around phones while drinking.  No mas.  Less than four hours until the Prince concert "officially" starts.  I am going to pepper San Antonio with NG cards the entire weekend.  Well, starting tomorrow afternoon, at least.  So I guess I ought to get off of here and write my damned "assignment" from Vicente, who is designing my website.  Don't look at it now, it isn't close to being finished.  I will blog from SA - V can take the laptop and I'll update you on weekend of the Final Four, NG and, of course, drinking.  Vicente is loosening up a little bit about that these days.  Perhaps he just needed a cocktail?  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Ahhh, this goes out to the  very rude  person who hung up on Mary and me when we drunk-dialed him last night from the bar of a very noisy neighborhood cajun restaurant while he had company.  (Was it a  girl ?  I need the scoop.)  One would think that  anyone  in their  right  mind would  welcome  a call from two cute young women,  drunk off their asses and yelling into a cell phone .  Isn't that a call  you'd  like to get, boys?  Vodka, vodka, vodka.  Oh well.  By the way, I am not serious, J.  We were just trashed and thought it'd be fun to call you.  No hard feelings.

      Vicente slammed me three different times.  E wasn't fooled, but he, Carmen, Mary/Lisa and Chonga all got me really good.  Edgar - if you ever  do  go to jail, don't call my ass to come bail you out.  My boss got me first thing in the morning.  I didn't even try to fool Mary.  Mary/Lisa and I went to Pappadeaux for "a couple drinks."  Like anyone believes that.  The cute, too young bartender came over as we were window shopping through the newest issue of Lucky.  I asked him to purchase me shoes and this cute, yellow and white Banana Republic purse, and he agreed.  However, he forgot to bring out Mary's shrimp.  I paid for the whole damned thing, not realizing I am already overdrawn at the bank, and I have to survive on my good looks and charm for the next 13 days (and my non-BF's AMEX, if he'll let me).  Vicente will be the CFO of nongirlfriend, as I suck ass when it comes to handling money.  V says he'll handle it  and me , as much as possible.  We're hitting the road early tomorrow for SA, trying to get my shirts out there and seen.  Wish us luck...I'm gonna be one tired, hungover nongirlfriend tomorrow morning.

      The door was a work in progress.  Now it is just there.  Again, I think I am afraid to finish it, plus I haven't found any good graphics for it lately.  I'm still wondering why the hell I drew a clothes hanger and wrote "mommie dearest" under it?  Mary/Lisa thinks I need a mission statement for my new business.  I quipped, "To get rich off of someone else without having to really do anything."  She loved it.  I wasn't serious but what the hell?  Have you actually read your company's mission statement lately?  It's all feel-good and seriousness.  I think we should have smartass mission statements, both for ourselves and our companies:  "To ruthlessly dominate the world and have everyone hate me."  (Microsoft)  "To capture helpless chickens and make their last days on this earth a living hell."  (KFC)  "To give young girls a reason to want their nails a pasty white."  (Liquid Paper)  "To turn us all into crazed, craftsy people."  (Michael's)  For purposes of covering my ass, I'm only JOKING Microsoft, KFC and Michael's.  Liquid Paper, I'm not.  Because I used several bottles of your stuff in my adolescence and I still get the urge to do a French manicure when I'm whiting out mistakes.  Copyright 2004 nongirlfriend.com

      Well, the crew all left (Paddy, Pitt, Jason, Paige and Joe) to eat Mexican food.  I really didn't want to go (feel bad as Paige is probably overdosing on testosterone as I type) but I did place an order for my requisite bean-and-cheese tacos (corn tortillas, since all they have are gummy flour ones at TC).  Think I'll go watch a movie.  They're toe-up drunk and won't be able to even order for another hour or so.  Jason had  way too much  champagne.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      For some reason, I ALWAYS wake up early on the weekends.  Not on work days, which would absolutely thrill my boss.  Just on the days I don't have to.  I have to go in to work at 7:30 on Tuesday.  That woman is killing me.  Looking back through the blog archives of several favorites, I noticed something.  Most everyone seems to write differently now.  It wasn't as "personal" back then.  Of course, we all seem to have gotten to know one another, that could explain it.  Back then, it was random babbling (myself included, don't think I'm picking on anyone) and now, well now it seems we write for particular people, or we address some blatantly in our posts.  I just found that very interesting.  Oh, and Mary/Lisa thinks it's strange that we don't use our real names.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       What the  hell  do they have to crow about at 6 a.m.???   I looked through the fence to see, and the damned chicken shut up and hid.  My neighbor has many pigeons, though.  Explains the amount of  bird shit  on my truck and backyard patio furniture.  I take it back:   I do not want any chickens as pets .  The one next door to me is enough.  I'll name it Rufus.

      There are times when I hate owning a home.  Like when something breaks, and I have to pay to fix it, and it isn't covered by my homeowner's warranty shit that I pay $40 a month for.  And when I find out the roots of the tree I dearly love are invading my sewer system.  And when I think of how many pairs of shoes I could buy for the same amount of money.  Oh, yes, and when I see my tax/insurance escrow statement every April.  But then there are times when I LOVE being a homeowner.  Like when I sit in my backyard and feel the wind blowing across my face, and know that this little plot of ground is my haven.  As unsightly as it is at times, I own this piece of land.  The wind sounds like the ocean and I sink myself into the thought of Carribean nights and lust and loads of good food and fun.  An imagination goes a long way for people with limited funds.

       Day.   Whatever.   Sincerely .  I really mean that.  The beginning wasn't as   sparkly   - I woke up at 4 a.m. and could not go back to sleep.  So I watched "Donnie Darko" again.  ( How many times is it now, Chicken?   Far too many to keep track of.)   Cult movies  don't become that way by being something you watch only once, you know?  I expect the same for "Big Fish."  Come to Momma, Ewan.  Move over, Jake.  The second part of my morning was good:   went back to bed with the  babies  .  Nico and Sadie (Snarky Bitch) do not have a problemo with this; Buzzy does.  I got, oh, 30 minutes of good REM sleep and then my dad starts laying on the doorbell.  So I go do the low-cost vet clinic thingie at my vet's office.  I figure I have to "bargain shop" for shots when I spend so much on emergency visits to the 24-hour place (knock on wood, those days are   over  ).  Afterwards, gearing myself up to make that oh-so-important phone call, I called  Vicente .  His son answered the phone:  "What do you want, Brenda?"  Twelve year-olds can be   so  charming .   I want three.   In this case, the apple didn't even fall from the tree, they are so much alike.  Cute, sarcastic and quite adept at  pushing my buttons .  This is how  fabulous  my non-boyfriend is...he's helping Joe move, and other than guitar lessons, he doesn't really know him.  I've known Joe for years but I'm not there, sweating and lifting boxes (I might break a nail, that's what movers are for).  So I practice and I practice and then I think, "I need a pedicure.  And my nails done.  And my eyebrows waxed."  The third scenario should have   never   happened.   I AM BALD ABOVE MY EYES.   I am pissed.  Bunny, I am  so  driving to your place in Richardson to be threaded.  It just takes me once to learn my lesson.  About beauty mistakes, not about men.   In case you haven't noticed .  By the way, I'm tired of  plucking .  My eyes water terribly and I'd prefer to be lying down when I receive my torture.  Or conveniently handcuffed to some large object.  (I'm  kidding .)  I'm seriously wondering about my state of mind this morning.  That   spree   at Sephora was totally unnecessary (as Mary/Lisa put it, "Exactly how many eyeshadows do you have now??") and I really don't need a new scent.   But I got one, babies .  And I got a really cool gift for Ms.  Bun Bun .  Oh Bunny - Vicente and I are on for  drinkies  next Saturday!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Fell asleep ( aha ) early, now I'm up with the other  Chickens , working on nongirlfriend.  Actually, I don't think those chickens are up yet.  I also ran out of dog food so my babies are eating  Ramen noodles .  (Not really, I had enough for breakfast, but I'm sure they would if I had any.  Just too much sodium in the Ramen.  And I don't even buy the stuff.)  Ick.  I sat here wondering the other day if I might not end up one of those sad old people who sit on park benches and  talk to the trees .  I'm forgetting a lot lately, and I am attributing it to the aluminum in my deodorant.  I don't think I want to get "old," period.  52 is about all I can stand.  I sold four shirts and two sleep sets just by wearing my t-shirt and walking in and out of our managers' meeting today.  There are more   nongirlfriends   out and about than I previously suspected.  Everyone wanted to know the story, but I am not telling.   Bunny  has a bday coming up.  I feel Sephora calling out to me.  Not just for Bunny (alas!), but I will have to wait on the " gifts for me " until after June Birthday Month (there are a LOT, plus anniversaries).  Bunny shares my cousin's bday (except for year).  At least she wasn't born in '66, like said cousin.  Demon Seed.  Having rid myself of my sweet tooth  years ago , I am wondering why I am eating three brownies in the middle of the night, and swigging down a Diet Coke to chase them.  These are some pretty good brownies, all dark-and-not-too-sweet chocolatey, and the melt-in-your-mouth variety.  At times, I question my relationship with chocolate.  And with  CHEESE .  Especially with  cheese .  It's an abusive relationship...I almost always devour the cheese.  The chocolate?  Well, I'm pretty ambivalent about that.  I can always take it or leave it.  Buzzy got "stuck" in the bathroom and is so happy to see me, I am now covered in dog spit.  It's a typical Saturday morning for me.  More later.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Left work an hour early to go see  Mary/Lisa 's  new house  out in Emhouse, Texas.  Where the fuck is Emhouse, you say?  Well, it's off I-45 and FM 1126, population 159 (about to be 165 when M/L and her friend, Josie, move into their houses).   Beautiful  house, I might add.   SO  jealous of the kitchen, bathroom, garden tub and those fucking walk-in closets.  The only thing I wouldn't trade is my hardwood floors (they're 45 years old and beautiful).  I'm giving Mary/Lisa my set of dishes I never use because they match her kitchen PERFECTLY.  She's also getting a few birdhouses and some tree lanterns, but she doesn't know that yet.  I'm happy she has company this weekend so she won't be reading this.   Now someone else has chickens for neighbors, too.   These are some loud chickens.  They live with the Mexicans across the street.  We grinned like idiots and waved as we drove past,  because that's what people in the country do:  they wave at you .  Even if they don't know you.  Probably  especially  if they don't know you.  There are no stores in Emhouse.  They do have two churches, like that would matter to me, but it does to Mary/Lisa.  There are many, many cows out there.  Some turkeys.  And lots of  chickens .  I think these people eat their chickens.  Ick.  I'm still strongly considering constructing a chicken run in my backyard and keeping a few as pets.  I've already got their names picked out.  But then, I digress (as usual).  I also saw a dog tied up in a yard, which you know I will "investigate" (i.e., "steal") the next time I am out there.  The closest Starbucks/nail salon/Wal-Mart is in Coriscana or Ennis.  There are no malls in the country.  Online shopping would simply have to do.  I'd go  crazy .  Express and Sephora withdrawal.   Scary .  No DSL out in the country, either.  But then, Mary/Lisa is not addicted to her computer like I am.  It's peaceful and quiet out in Emhouse.  I am pretty certain no one locks their doors.  The mayor lives on M/L's street.  She's already met her neighbors (I only know one of mine, besides the little boy across the street who has a crush on me, and I don't care for the neighbor I know).  Don't get me wrong - I am not knocking M/L's new home.  My mother and father would have   simultaneous multiple orgasms   over it.  Myself, I'm a suburban girl.  I like my city close by, just don't care to be in the middle of it.  However, should I become filthy stinking rich, I'll buy a loft downtown with a rooftop garden and haul my happy ass and herd of Min Pins there.  Why not?  The bars are within  stumbling distance , after all.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Roly Polys...whatever.  Where the fuck are they all coming from??  One more day to  crawl  through...I obviously did not win the lottery or become independently wealthy overnight.   Long  day ahead.  One I wanted to take off but too many things already planned.  Do you know of anyone who schedules meetings late in the afternoon on a Friday before a long holiday weekend?  I always thought that was when everyone left at three and stopped off for happy hour before heading home.  Perhaps in a different universe.  I once had this boss who would call me from Tokyo and say, "If Mr. X (his subordinate) doesn't need you to stay, why don't you go home early?  It's a holiday."  Of course, my boss was one of those people you simply  did not fuck with , so Mr. X never needed me to stay.  This is the same guy who didn't like the bonus my company gave me the first year I was there, so he wrote an additional check out of his own account to make up for it.   I could have hit him for moving to Tokyo .  I never would have left that company had he not taken the position overseas.  It was when I was working there that I met  Vicente .  Work - the place we spend the most time at, the people we spend the most time with, and most everyone I know doesn't really love their job.  Maybe this is why so many people are on medication?  Buzzy, everyone's favorite (save Paddy Mac, who prefers the  Snarky Bitch ), is driving me loony right now.  I typically get up early enough to have some "alone time" (okay, " blog time ") and then go back to sleep for another hour or so.  Today, Buzzy will not go back to bed with the other dogs.  He is also the one who wakes you up at five a.m. on a Saturday to be fed.  Hell, even fat dog  Sparky  would go back to sleep after his chow.  And I thought the pheno he is on was a sedative?  Poor Buzzy - he's not altogether there.  Epileptic and sort of  vague , he sometimes stares at nothing and walks backwards.  He is also very clingy, but he is the sweetest dog I've ever met.  Everyone who comes over loves Buzzy, but not all can tolerate his oral fixation with legs.  Damn.  I'm out of Diet Coke, and caffeine is such an important staple in my diet.   God help us  if I run out of cigarettes.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I had to delete a couple posts.  My blog is read by at least two co-workers (I know, I'm an  idiot , why did I show them in the first place, right?) and my level of bitchiness about my job lately could get me into trouble.  You know those street signs that say, Caution - Falling Rocks?  I should have one that says,  Watch Out - Blowing Chunks .  Please someone remind how very bad an idea it is to eat Long John Silvers the next time I think I should go ahead and eat fried food.  I'm still not sure the fish are done spawning in my digestive system.  Is that stuff really even fish anyway?  Oh well, at least I don't have  urlLink spooge in my cereal .  Ahem.  Vicente told me to take out posts that made me appear "wacko" to the wandering reader.  I wouldn't have a fucking blog if I did that.    Men  .  What little they know.  Except for  urlLink WH , who doesn't act like a typical man.  He's either made up or too good to be true.  (No,  I am  not  flirting , Vicente.  I'm merely stating the obvious.)  I caught V on the phone right about the time the  hookers  showed up.  My only remark:   Just wear a condom .  In fact, I used to send him off at the aeropuerto with that quip, back in the old days.  I haven't been this ready for a holiday since, oh, since the last time we had one.  My Chicken To Do List has changed somewhat, as I have an important meeting next week.  Nails and Toes are still on (naturally), vet visit is, too.  I decided, however, to get my hair cut.  I just don't know how I want it to look.  Actually, I take that back, I want it to look like  urlLink "London Chicken"  (you have to scroll down).  I really need to grow it out so I can cut it shorter.  Counter-intuitive, I know.   VODKA AND CIGARETTES - THE BREAKFAST OF  CHAMPIONS    Vicente has taken to reading my blog on a regular basis, so my future posts will be censored.  (whatever)  I'm just flattered he's taken an interest.  And nervous, too.  I'm wondering what ilk lies in the archives...  No WH, Bunny, Pisser, Scorpy, Neko, et al... I will  not  be deleting again .  I just didn't want to get fired,  okay ?  You know, I'm an  organ donor .  I think a lot of people should be, but not me.  Let's break this down and see why:   Eyes  - I'm fucking blind as a bat, and I can cross one eyeball while the other still keeps looking forward   Ears  - going deaf, too - still won't make me turn my stereo down   Lungs  - heh heh heh   Heart  - (see lungs)   Kidneys  - I hate water   Liver  - (please refer to all alcohol-related posts, which would be 367 out of the 370 I've posted)   Brain  - well, if I hadn't killed off so many brain cells, that actually might not be such a bad idea  Okay, moving on...  Just how curious are you all to hear about Vicente's meeting?  Oh,  never mind !  I have to go... I need to feed my Food Baby  and read some more dirt about Courtney Love.

      Vicente is off for a jaunt to the Midwest, then his offspring arrives in town.  Afterwards, he will be traveling, traveling, traveling and I probably won't see him until fucking August.  Actually, I exaggerate.  I will see him next weekend.  V just chimed in, "Yea, I get to be a slut."  He was referring to me.  Bastard.  Anyway, since EVERY SINGLE FUCKING PERSON I KNOW has plans this weekend, so I guess I have to find something to do.  Like...  * Pedicure (my toes look horrific)  * Nails (not as bad as toes)  * Buy a swim suit and lay out in the backyard with the babies  * Clean the fucking house  * Shopping (for groceries, not clothes, damn it)  * Buzzy to the vet  In reality, I will probably...  * Buzzy - vet  * Toes and fingers (it's a priority)  * Buy only necessary groceries (frozen cheese pizza, dog food, CHEESE)  * Watch a few movies  * Have a couple of cocktails  * Lay out in the backyard in last year's suit  * Have a couple more cocktails  Fuck it all, I intend to be lazy this weekend.

Have you ever seen a ghost? Yes  9. Would you rather go to a carnival or circus?

Your favorite fictional animal? The Pushme-Pullme in Dr. Doolittle  12. Have you ever flown first-class? Yes and it ruined flying for me  13. Would you go on a reality show?

      Now I'm in a frenzy.  I was good there for a couple of days.  Then, that bottle of champagne last night.  Ick.  That is what I feel like.  Ick.  Now off to a shiny happy meeting with my boss.  I am really looking forward to this long weekend.  Think I might take Friday off, too.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       Bite me.   It's allowed.  I am, after all, this histrionic creature known to man as WOMAN.  Hear me roar.  Or whimper, at times.   Depends upon my  mood  .  V wouldn't read my blog for fear of a "roast" he wouldn't quite like.  I doubt I ever said that much in here.  Mary/Lisa, Dianne, FHB, all the rest (Princette included),   yeah yeah yeah  , you knew it would all be okay.  Does that make me a sucker?  I will tell you this:  For the first 30 minutes, I was nervous.  I'm   NEVER   nervous.  I'm totally at ease in most situations.  But there I was sweating bullets, drinking wine, trying to calm down.   And this is why .  There have only been a few times where I've been faced with someone worthy as my opponent (well, at least a  male  version).  Vicente is that.  Fighting/sparring/making up with someone else just wouldn't be as much fun.  Yeah, I'm a fucking sucker.  I'm back to where I started.  But it's like passing "Go" and getting that $200 Monopoly money.  It is somehow satisfactory without being real.  At the same time.  By the way, Sistahs, I said what I needed to say and he heard me.  I didn't back down.  Yeah, but neither did he.  That is what makes it so beautiful.  Neither one of us  had to .  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Oh, but as my father said to me earlier tonight (last night, I guess), "You like to live dangerously, don't you?"  And he was serious.  I don't.  In fact, I rarely exceed the speed limit.  Probably because my truck won't go that fast, but anyway.  That's gotta count for something, right?  Now Fab D,  she's another story .  She wanted to ask Nein to meet us for drinks.  Yep, it's me again, Timmy.  I'm having trouble sleeping.  Amanda, you haven't heard anything - my dad's got one of those East Texas, "country" accents.  When he can get a word in edgewise, that is.  Pisser, go ahead and confuse Cranky - start talking like we do back here.  Say (I  hate  this word) "fixin" at least three times tomorrow.  I suppose I can go lie and stare at the ceiling some more.  It's just that I had this dream about feta cheese and had to get up and cook me up some beans.  Jeez, this accent thing is rubbing off on me.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      (sorry, but at least I steal from the  great ones )  I'm coming up on the one year anniversary of Sparky's death.  At times, I think I am prepared for it.  Other times, I realize I am not.  At one time, that damn dog meant  everything in the world  to me.  I tend to be dramatic, bear with me.  I cried like a baby for  DAYS  after his departure.  My non-BF wasn't really there (I still have some resentment for that, but I think he just did not know how to deal with it,  or me ).  Mary/Lisa went with me and Fab D came by to check on me.  My mom couldn't bear to send a card because she started sobbing every time she went to write in it.  I received it a month after the fact.   I saved them all.   Who would have thunk that they made Pet Sympathy cards?  Certain smells get me right in the gut, and I break down.  Even now.  Sparky's toes smelled like Fritos.  I can't eat those anymore.  Especially since they give me indigestion.  I made 25+ CD mixes in honor of him, passed them out at times (I'm not lying).  My Door (work of, ahem, art) has puppy pics of him.  Back before he was sick, when he still looked like a Min Pin.  When he felt good enough to trash my entire apartment and then look up at me like  what-the-hell-was-I-thinking-being-mad-I-didn't-do-anything? .   Loss.   I hate that word.  I cannot imagine what Bunny is going through now.  I have my parents around.  Most people would say alcohol or nicotine were my crutches.  Nope, got ya fooled.  It's my mom and dad.  I love them more than anything (Sparky came in third).  I will be fucking   devastated   when they're no longer around.  Okay, so I lose my BF of four years.  I'm sad, yes, but he's alive and well and it really isn't the same as  really  losing him.  Break-ups are hard, but you have the chance to say "I'm sorry" later on.  Death is not that forgiving.  Isn't it funny and strange that the things that piss us off about someone are the very things we remember and immortalize when they are gone?  Sparky could chew on  anything  in my house today  and I just wouldn't give a fuck .  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I want some  eggs .  Over  easy .  And a short stack of pancakes.  Lots of butter and syrup.  I want a Denny's breakfast.  I think I'll go tomorrow even though I don't have my normal Sunday morning breakfast date (who definitely is  not  normal).  Food is all I've been thinking about tonight (this morning, whatever).  And I've eaten more since 7:30 p.m. than I have in the last three days.   I HAVE INSOMNIA.   But I ain't gonna take them sleeping pills the doctor gave me.  Those things scare me.   Good news :  My boss found her dog.  Some woman returned him.  My flyers helped, I guess.  (I hope she couldn't tell we'd been having coq-tails when she called.)   MENSTRUAL CYCLE...YOU  BLOW   I really should change my Unky Mood to "Bloated"   What the fuck is nongirlfriend doing up at two a.m. when she's usually asleep  (passed out)  at ten?  you might ask.  Not drinking.  Maybe I should start.  I'm tempted to go watch a PPV movie...perhaps  Gothika .  So then I  really  won't be able to sleep.  Edgar has my "Donnie Darko" DVD so I can't watch that.  Bastard.  Insomnia has plagued me my entire life, but my worst bout of it was shortly after I moved into my house, before Paddy Mac came to live with me.  This was Pre-V, although we had already met.  We just weren't  fucking  yet.  Being fascinated with murder (ironic for a non-violent person such as myself, who cannot even kill bugs, I make others do it for me while I'm not looking), I began reading two books by this guy who was the original profiler for the CIA or one of those acronymns.  I read both books in three days (had to go to work at some point) and then spent the next  THREE FUCKING  WEEKS   not being able to go to sleep until four...then having to wake my sorry ass up at five.  Naturally, I was Grumpy Chicken those days.  Come to think of it, I didn't have a nickname (that people would say to my face) at that time.  I was just Bren.  Grumpy Bren.  Sleepless In The Ville.  I'm just not as  perky  as Meg Ryan is.  And I don't have a thing for Tom Hanks.    Anyway  ...  I fucking have to fucking work fucking tomorrow.  Grrr.  I'd actually be content if I never had to work again.  I'm  lazy  that way.  Hey,  go check out my photos .  Please don't hate me because I'm, er, sorta cute.  And yes, that sofa  has  seen better days.  That last photo is one of the very last photos taken of Sparky, about three weeks before he died.  I still pretty much look like London Chicken.  My hair just isn't as snappy (I'm working my way back to that style, baby).  I have a pic of V's butt that I just might post.  It  is  rather hot, after all.   Best Bday Gift:   The trip to Europe, from Vicente.   Most Well-Thought-Out Bday Gift:   The Chick-Can from my brother and sister-in-law (I'm a vegetarian)   Bday Gift I've Overtly Hinted At But Never, EVER Received:   Pale pink fluffy bathrobe (I know, I know, just go BUY myself one - it's not the same)   Strangest Bday Gift:   A jar of olives   Most Lush-ous Bday Gift:   All that wine V gave me last year   Most Practical Bday Gift:   A washer and dryer, from my generous parents (they combo'd it with Christmas)   Most Touching Bday Event:   The bday card I received from Paddy Mac, who was living in Austin at the time, and the phone call that night while I was out with all my friends (he never remembers bdays or doesn't "celebrate" them, but he did when I turned 30) - the card was illustrated (he's pretty good at that stuff) and half in English, half in Russian  My older brother, whom I will refer to as Geek Boy from now on, said to me once that his mind "never rested."  I think mine is napping most of the time during the day.  It wakes up at six and then I'm hyper unless I take something.  How on earth can V expect me to be calm and rational when I don't have a good sleeping pattern?  How can he expect me to be calm and rational, period?  I once had a hotel-roommate yell at me in her sleep to just "go to sleep already, will ya?!"  Yes, it  is  that bad.  I think I will go in the other room and play Strip Solitaire.  I also think someone dropped me on my head as a young child but won't own up to it.  That could really explain a lot.  * * * * *  And now for something completely different...  * * * * *  The  Baby Machine  came to visit my parents with her four children.  Glad my mom doesn't read this, she actually likes Psycho BM.  V, you think I'm  psychotic ?  This woman beats me, hands down (padded cell and all that).  She gives your ex a run for her money.  Baby Machine hates me because I am everything she is not:  single, childless and  free to do what I want .  I remember being at a Bunko (argh!) Party with the whole lot of them and the only woman there who would talk to me was M.  Probably because she didn't see single women as a threat to her relationship like most married women do (I used to, marriage is EVIL).  BM's husband was pouring liquor in an empty Dr. Pepper can because BM wouldn't let him drink.   I slipped him some Jack.   And thanked God I wasn't in a  matrimonial  way.  There is a fucking chicken carcass on my kitchen counter that Paddy didn't seem to get around to throwing away last night.  I'm nauseous.   I think I gained five pounds from all the macaroni and cheese I ate tonight.   And goddamnit, I'm still craving those fucking Ding Dongs.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I'm on  sugar overload  now.  Oh, I see  urlLink Scottie   is committed to staying clean (again).  I'm not one to talk but I'll believe it when it happens.  Gotta love him, though.  He's definitely not in hiding.  And for the record, I'd take Scott over Axil any day of the week.  I'm just hoping SW will get his  nipples pierced  or something.   EVERYONE  has their addiction(s).  Some of ours are just more  obvious  than others'.  I'm supposed to go out tonight but don't know if I will.  I certainly would be a lot of fun after all this sugar.  I'm blaming my period and my mother.  My period, because of the chocolate.  My mother, because she made those goddamned brownies.  Noticeably bitchy today.  Too much sleep.

      Driving by Wendy's this morning, I saw this on the marquee:   New Chicken Temptations - The Taste Just Got Better   Of course I had to post about it.   Damn, as if Chicken can't get much better than it already is .  Mary/Lisa gave me a card today to cheer me up.  On the front was this  interesting -looking woman enjoying a cocktail and puffing away on a ciggie.  It read:  You smoke too much. You drink too much. You have questionable morals.  ( ahem ?)  Inside it read:  You're everything I ever wanted in a friend!    Fucking beautiful!    I'm still Thawing Chicken, no Oven-Roasted Chicken here.  Because I spent the last two days helping my boss try to locate her prodigal Lab.  Now all the work I needed to complete will have to be done this weekend.   But for a dog, it's worth it.   (Side note:  I'd do the same for a cat, even though I'm allergic.)  At least the work isn't rocket science.  However, I do need to be lucid in order to do it.  Which could pose a problem.  So I'm going to be free-range Fried Chicken tomorrow with M/L (none of that KFC bullshit for me, no sir!).  They say it takes you 28 days to break any habit, which is interesting.  If that were the case, no one would need therapy and/or medication.  Except for us   wackos   with chemical imbalances.  And my second husband (Psycho Boy).  In the past, to quit some destructive habits I've had, I've entertained the following methods:   * Behavior Modification  (I learned to like and even  anticipate  the popping of a rubber band against my wrist)   * Hypnotherapy  (MAJOR BULLSHIT - don't waste your money)   * Guilt  (I cannot shame myself into doing  anything )   * Sex  (Wait!  How did  that  get in here?)   * Yoga  ( unh-uh )   * Transcendental Meditation  (not really, just wanted to see if you were paying attention)   * Patches, Gum And Other Disgusting Things You Should Not Put In Your Mouth Or On Your Skin   I've come to the conclusion that you do not quit any habit successfully without  really wanting  to quit said habit.  Explains why Paddy Mac and my Poppy (both former heavy smokers) quit cold-turkey.  They actually had the  desire .   I don't.   I don't want to.  Not right now.  Being that I am a person who can get caught up in the hub-bub of the world and  forget to eat , I probably should go do so.   It will feel that much better in the a.m.   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Some guy said that on the Edge the other morning, when they were talking about the sadness of losing sister station, the Eagle.  I laughed so hard my eyeliner slipped a fraction of an inch.  One of those, you-had-to-be-there things, I guess.  It was all in the way that he said it.  But then, isn't everything?  I was feeling quite sorry for myself last night so I decided to search for articles or interviews with  Cynthia Heimel .  Reading just one of them cheered me  way the fuck up , even more than a pedicure could.  Her book,  urlLink Advanced Sex Tips For Girls - This Time It's Personal  , is hilarious even after the seventh time you've read it.  I have read every single book she's written, including her play.  Don't know what happened to all of them (maybe I loaned them out? if so,  please return ) but I do know I need to start reading them again.  Non-girlfriend has lost her edge.  Oh well, MY world's still good.  At least I didn't lose my radio station.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Okay, I'm sitting in the tub this morning, sudsing, rinsing, shaving, shampooing.  The regular stuff.   It's not unusual  for at least two of my dogs to be in with me.  This time, Buzzy and Sadie (Snarky Bitch).  Buzzy was nuzzling my DUKE cheerleader shorts.  I yelled, "Buzzy, STOP!"  So he begins to try to flip my red nongirlfriend tank, until he gets it on his body.  And his arms are through the correct places.  Poor Buzzy.  I'm sure he never really knew about cross-dressing until now.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       WARNING :  Do not shake or   agitate  ; contents may  explode .  Just a caveat for all of you.  Due to the recent diagnosis of my mental state, I thought I would share with you a less  crazy  Chicken, back before she was Chicken and when she was called PIAB (if you wanna know what that means, you gotta ask).  This was  pre-Sparky-getting-sick , some time ago.  It was also when I made  a LOT more $$$  and could go shopping at North Park Mall at lunch on a regular basis and not have overdraft charges to fret about.   Good times .   urlLink You Won't Find The F-Bomb Here   Okay, so I was  crazy  then, too.  I just didn't cuss as much.  Today, at lunch, Mary/Lisa and I are going to go purposely give ourselves skin cancer.  I figure with the smoking and " occasional  cocktail," I'll achieve my goal of not being one of those  squawky old people  that annoy me on planes.  Seriously, I have to get a   glow   before summer for two reasons:   (1)  I don't want to blind people with so much WHITE FLESH showing when I go to the lake for the first few times, and  (b)  I'm vain and I want to wear my new minis  NOW .  I expect mucho chastising re: tanning, so  let it rip !  According to  urlLink Pisser , getting up early does not mean you will make it to work on time.  In fact, quite the opposite.  I would have to  strongly  agree.  Getting up early for me means  more time to be distracted .  By the squirrels next door, mating, for example.  And by daydreams of being independently wealthy and being able to sleep until nine (yeah, like that's gonna happen with three Min Pins).  And by fantasies involving thin crust cheese pizza that has just the perfect cheese:sauce ratio.  More proof that I am a twisted individual.  Oh, but in a  good  way.

       That's my new drinking motto .   If I ever get back around to that again .  Snarky Bitch is strange.  She's taken to staring at windows for ten, fifteen minutes.  Mind you, the blinds are CLOSED.   There is  nothing  to look at !  Jeez.  My favorite  urlLink Anne Taintor  pic?  "I dreamed the whole house was clean."  Hon, it's not a dream.  It's  reality .  Only after I get off my lazy ass and finish dusting.  It's so much  more fun  to have someone else clean for me.  However, maid + Sephora + shoes + clothes =  very poor  Chicken  .  Sadie is still staring at the window.  Oh wait, now she is staring at the floor.  Like momma, like daughter.  Dazed, confused, and seeing things that  just aren't there .  Oh, and don't forget the  bitchiness .  Actually, Sadie has this voluptuous look about her.  (I don't.)  And she has lots of whiskers.  (Again, I don't.)  Thank God my  vanity  doesn't drift down to the dogs, right?  Pluck, pluck, pluck and I might come away missing an appendage.   Sadie also likes to hump my leg .  In this way, we differ.   I only hump strangers' legs .  Hey!  Guess who got a  raise ?   Not me .  Well, I really have absofuckinglutely nothing to write about tonight, so I'm off to kill a few brain cells and watch TV.

      But at least I'm not   psychotic  .  Well, maybe  every now and then .  Ahem.  Just got back from 1 1/2 hours of driving to various area shelters looking for my boss' dog.   HEY YOU, FUCKING SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS!   God, what is wrong with these people??  And these Owner Give-Ups - "he was destructive" - awww, poor you.  If you would fucking   TRAIN YOUR PETS  , they would behave.  I'm sure your sofa is more important than that dog about to be euthanized (OGUs are put down after 72 hours here, just to make room for the strays).  I personally saw 89 dogs I wanted to make my own "animal companion."  However, the   Snarky Bitch   at home might not like the competition.  At the shelter in Oak Cliff (right behind the zoo, how convenient), I saw a largish black-and-tan Min Pin (who, in true form, growled at me).   Forgiveness  - remember my post about that Monday?  Well, I was a "bigger" person and called the psycho who crucified me a few months back when I wanted to quit volunteering.  Thank God I got her husband.  He seems saner.   It's them  hormones , Jean.  They just  do  something to that girl.   My assistant, who also happens to be my boss' sister (we're all family here, practically), went along with me to help expedite the search.  Driving there, I took a drag off a ciggie and thought to myself that it tasted like  roast beef .  Well, we   can't   have that since I am now a vegetarian.  I almost threw it out the window but hell, they're going up a dollar a pack (thanks Gov!) so I need to conserve.  Anyway...not to deviate from my spiraling-out-of-control path I've been on, I asked a weird question of M&M (assistant).  She, too, has had "  tasty  " cigarettes.  She said something about motor oil (don't wanna know about that) and we talked about our different experiences with our  Willy Wonka Cigarettes .  We also talked about strawberry flavored rolling papers, but that was a different subject entirely.   News at Eleven:   Part Two of Zany Housecleaning Spree, with  photos .

      My boss' yellow Lab opened the gate during last Thursday's thunderstorm and although they've looked everywhere and called vets and shelters, they haven't found him.  His son is depressed, crying, and won't eat.  ANYONE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF DALLAS COUNTY OR ELLIS COUNTY - keep your eyes open.  He goes by Jack, is a beautiful and friendly dog, and has a black birth mark on his face.  Thanks!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Well, something lit a  fire  under our asses last night.  Paddy Mac did a  fabu  job on the den and my floors look a hell of a lot better in the kitchen/dining room.  They're old, so they don't look perfect, but as Mary/Lisa told me this morning,  nothing is .  M/L was a savior last night, letting me cry in her ear for what I'm sure seemed like forever for her.  As I've said before,  the girl should be sainted .  I managed to get a little more sleep last night, but not much.  Up with the chickens (or at least the one next door) this morning.  That being so, today I actually have time to do this in the morning, rather than running late (as is my standard MO).  No word for today, not yet.  But I'm thinking of a really good one right now.

      I walk outside my back door and look to the west.  There is a beautiful  chicken  on top of my neighbor's pigeon coop (he's weird about birds like that) that was crowing his/herself silly.  I got closer to the bird, who was standing on one leg like a flamingo, and I could see little golden spots in its feathers.  My kind of chicken - it went and got highlights.  "Let me understand. You've got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"   And where can  I  sign up ?  Something's missing all right.

      (or lack thereof)  Finally fell asleep at 2:30 this morning, only to wake up at 3:45, 4:41 and 5:30.  I'm thinking several cups of coffee and a few diet Cokes are in order this morning.  I'm also thinking of putting my insomnia to work for me and power-cleaning my house tonight.  However, I may be so tired this evening when I get home that I simply pass out and wake up at ten, only to do a repeat performance of last night.  Quick! a quiz...while my mind is still foggy enough to make it a really stupid one:   1)  Inny or Outty?   2)  Punk or Polka?   3)  Intensity or Apathy?   4)  Great Sex or Great Conversation?   5)  Meerkat or Monkey?

      Only on my first glass of milk, maybe two or three more will render me sleepy.  The insomnia worsened when I started my Prozac seven months ago.  The only thing that can knock me out is  vodka .  However,  I have gone off the vodka  and am now fucking  wide awake .  If I did fall asleep, I'd just keep having to get up to go pee anyway.    Someone please post a  really  boring comment  .  Maybe that will help.   At least my dogs still want to sleep with me .  Truth be told, I doubt they'd even notice if I wasn't in there with them.  I thought I'd try a hot bath to see where that would take me.  So I grab the latest Oprah magazine and strip.  I'm really digging Oprah's funky outfit on the cover, but I wonder why she's posed like she's doing aerobics?  Ooohh, " Man Trouble?  Dr. Phil's got  answers  " - I needed that article yesterday, O.  What's wrong with you,  girlfriend ?   Shit.   I  really  cannot make myself sleepy.  I think I am thinking about it too much.  Already, I'm halfway through my third pack of cigarettes (I don't even make it to two packs these days).  Well, if I don't have a heart attack in the middle of the night, I'll be all scratchy sounding tomorrow.  My  urlLink  tree frog    voice.  I agree with  urlLink Pisser's   "attitude adjustment" in regards to relationships.  Except I would probably opt for a skillet, since that makes a nice clangy sound when it hits your skull.  Plus, I just like saying the word "skillet."  Skillet, skillet, skillet.  I find the iron skillets are the very best.  My mom's got a nice heavy one I can borrow.  Patricia Mitchell has an informative article about  urlLink loving your cast iron skillet  .  Seems I might not need Dr. Phil's advice after all.    Ooh  , I see that Patricia, that  naughty  girl, has not one but  TWO  cast iron skillets...a ten-incher that she uses almost daily, and a "12-inch heavy duty monster" that weighs in at fifteen pounds.  After all, size  does  matter, doesn't it ladies?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      After sitting at home  ALL FUCKING DAY , waiting for a plumber who shows up at 7:10 p.m., I finally have my toilets back.  Well, one of them.  The other has a broken handle from last week and I'll be damned if I have them do it ($120!!!).  I'll repair the fucker myself.   I'm a smart girl.    Most of the time .  You knew I couldn't stay away for too long ("a few  days"  to regroup after my upsetting morning? yeah, right), and now I will be up all night long, it seems.  I've consumed  FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE .  Granted, it's the weak-ass coffee I make, so it's more like two, but still.  At 10 o'clock at night?  And I suffer from insomnia, to make it even more interesting.  Grrr.   I must be insane  (I know at least one person right now who would wholeheartedly agree with me).  I chain smoke when I'm upset.  And have panic attacks (so far, I've had three).  And drink lots of coffee.  It is a   really good thing   that the toilet is working again, because I've been peeing like every ten minutes.  Just  thinking  about it makes me need to go again.  Hold on...  Whew, I could give Curly Top's  urlLink Fountain of Pee   a run for her money.  I couldn't figure out how to turn on my satellie TV earlier (an example of a time I'm not-so-smart), so I sat reading about famous serial killers, which seemed to cheer me up  somewhat .  I know, that is twisted, but I can tell myself that  at least my life is better than theirs ...  The word of the day, kiddos:   FORGIVENESS  which is defined as "the act of forgiving" (duh), meaning  urlLink this  .  This word is much  nicer  than "salacious" and is helpful in daily human interactions.  It's also a very  urlLink  magnanimous    thing to do.    People should try it.

      We all make them.  We can say we are sorry all we want to but it's like Meg Ryan said in "When Harry Met Sally...":  "You can't take it back, it's already out there!"  I think I may have wrecked one of the most important relationships I have yesterday.  I've said I'm sorry, but in reality, all I can do is prove that I am sorry.  It's a lonely feeling knowing that you hurt someone else, especially when it is someone that you love.  I need a few days to come back from this.  Quiet, solitude, introspection - things I try my best to avoid.  The very things I need to embrace.  It's so very easy for me to cry at the mistakes people make in movies because there is usually a happy ending, and even if there isn't, there's an ending you can live with.  I just don't know this time.   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I've been crying for the past 45 minutes and my eyes are almost swollen shut.  And  it's all Vicente's fault .    Damn it , he made me watch that movie !  I don't know if it was Albert Finney or that big ol' catfish or the weirdness in all the stories.  Or if it's because I'm about to start my period.  Or, if it's like Vicente said, the father told the same kind of outlandish tales I concoct.  And have been, since as long as I can remember.  It most certainly could have been  Ewan McGregor .  I don't know.  All I know is that if I could know when and how I would die, I might be a little more fearless, like Edward Bloom.  I would really hate to think I would be more like that guy who dies on the toilet.  Always envious, never satisfied, always looking over my shoulder at someone I think is my nemesis, when I could have made them my friend and have been better off for it.   Mortality .  Jesus.

      I am completely exhausted from traipsing around the Byron today.  Vicente  forced  me to consume several margaritas.  Then I forced him to go shopping at Sephora with me.  Before the shopping adventure, we had  wild hot monkey sex  which left V a bit  dazed .  See, he was "aroused" the entire afternoon and it wasn't necessarily because I was there (I'm not stupid).  Thanks to shamelessly whoring myself, there are now a dozen or so gorgeous girls who are sporting the new nongirlfriend attire.  Oh, and Monica, the Penthouse girl, was   hot   and offered us a dance if we stopped by the club later.  Too bad we're both too tired to troll on out there.  She had on a cute silver belt that read " Naughty " - I am going to have to get me one of those.  Aren't you the  least bit curious  what I bought at Sephora today?   *  Diorskin Pure Light Sheer Skin-Lighting Makeup in "Cameo" (oil free and light as a feather - it feels great!)   *  Benefit Do It Daily Moisturizer (I am running out of the old bottle)   *  Benefit Ooh-La-La Lift (have seen it noted in several magazines as one of the best ways in the morning to make your eyes not look like you've been slamming vodka shots the night before) - I will update you on this tomorrow, after I've had a chance to more closely examine the product (guess that means I'll be drinking tonight, you know, in the name of science and to aid women everywhere)   *  Yves St. Laurent's newest scent, "In Love Again" (V  loved  it on me - Fab D will be jealous when she reads this)   *  Urban Decay Eyeshadow in "Kiss" and "Shotgun"   *  Sephora Super Shimmer Lip Gloss in "Cherry"   *  Smith's Rosebud Salve (great for drying cuticles and extending the life of your pedicure)   *  L'Occitaine Shea Butter Balm (for Vicente)   *  Hard Candy's Stain & Shine in "Stop"   *  Sephora Girls Shimmery Body Gel in "Blueberry"   *  Talika's Lipocils (eyelash conditioning gel with vegetable extracts)  Yeah, Yeah,  YEAH , I know I already have too much makeup according to the two agents who rifled through my purse and carry-on bag at the San Antonio airport.  Those of you who do not understand need to kiss my lily white Irish ass.  Just don't use  my  lip gloss to do it.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      God,  it's an  addiction  .  My non-boyfriend   HATES   it.  Only because he worries what I'll write about him in here.   Get over it, Vicente .  At least I'm not going on Jerry Springer with this shit.  K?  I sat on the airplane with the Senior Citizens' Revue.  Christ, never EVER travel at noon.  Not on Southwest.  I got stuck in the midst of many "ol' sorority sisters" and had to endure their chit-chat.    Why don't people shut the fuck up on airplanes???    I couldn't read my (guilty pleasure) People magazine in peace.  I'm not an age-ist, by the way.  I just wanna sit there in my seat and read some stupid magazine without all the squealing.

       Nein  - We do not speak of dead anythings in here, unless in jest.  Especially not dogs.  Shut the fuck up.   Anonymous  - Be brave.  We won't bite you (not at first, at least).  Come out and tell us who you are.  Don't be a chicken.  That's  my  job.   Who Hymn  - Rest assured, SA is still intact.  I had an awful time down there.   Zero  - I lost them all.  I've had to slowly rebuild them.  Get used to the Pepto Pink, as I am NEVER going through this again.  I'll add you back.  (Besides, I was hurriedly trying to do it at work.)  And no, I never heard from Princette - not since the Prince concert.   JEB  - Many thanks for the enthusiasm.   Bad Mamma Jamma  - I sure the hell don't fucking have a clue.  I think I'm cuter when I have makeup on but who the hell knows what men think.  (I've   REALLY   missed cussing the past two days.)   Pisser  - I don't know why, but that "I needs me some Chicken" comment really got me excited.  And flattered.  Not to worry, my fabulous LA Babe (well, one of them), I'm back, intact, and not missing anything (except for maybe my stomach after that fucked-up landing at Love Field).   Bun-Bun  - It IS Atari-ish, isn't it?  I would so love the BR look.  That was my favorite place as a child (back when I still had a sweet tooth, now it's pizza parlors).  Please do try to meet up with us tonight!   Neko  - I love it when you comment because my puppie's name is Nico, and although they are spelled differently and you certainly are NOT a dog, it just makes me smile to see Neko.  I was in SA, hating every moisture-saturated minute of it.   TIMMY!  - Shanks, my friend.  I don't know about what you wrote, but my ego always appreciates any sort of buoyance you can add.   Everyone Else Who Did Not Comment  - Yeah, now I'll posting again, like once every hour.  You don't like it, move on to another blog.  But at least leave a snarky comment so I can snark right back at you.     Thought for the moment:   I wanna make a cool wave, ride it out for a couple years, then sail off into the distance, leaving my mark behind.  Still waters are not for me.

      My trip to San Antonio was,  eh , less than I bargained for in some ways, much more so in others.  First,  I hate to fly .  And we flew through several lovely thunderstorms on the way down Thursday morning.  Yep, those storms that caused all the flooding.  Second, I felt like I stepped into a fucking  sauna  when I exited the airport.  There went the cute hair.  Third, the first person I had to train was recovering from a migraine and I felt like I was taking up time she could be at home, sleeping it off (I know I would be).  Fourth, the Alexander sauce at Pappadeaux had a funky-tasting crawfish in it, which will put me off that really quickly, and quite possibly  forever .  I just don't have good luck at that Pappadeaux.  Fifth, the other people I trained were in grumpy moods (maybe we were   ALL   PMS'ing?) so that made me grumpier.  Sixth, all I wanted to do was sleep after we finished, but really wished I felt like hanging out at Champps with Ms. V and her crew, watching the Spurs (that last second thing was  BULLSHIT ).  Seventh, my takeout cheese pizza was too cheesy.  I had three shots of Skyy and went to bed.  Oh, after watching Style Court and "How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days."  8th (I'm getting  lazy ), I woke up at five this morning and couldn't go back to sleep.  9th, the Expo was  BORING .  I saved the best for last...  10th,   I got to leave early   because someone forgot to leave the overnight holding Dallas payroll in it and people were screaming for their checks.  Now I am home, in a nongirlfriend tank and Old Navy boxers (cute ones, with little stars all over them), sipping a diet Coke and a Cranberri Stoli.  Plus, I get to go to the Byron tomorrow.  Because  VICENTE IS THE NICEST .  (v, there, I said it.)  I'm tired from this ridiculous week.  I'm going to go watch Lifetime Movie Network and take a nap.

       Damn. Damn.  Damn .   I have on these adorable thongs (for your feet, not your Chicken parts) and the right one is  KILLING  my foot.  Right at the spot my adorable Carls Jr. lookalike star tattoo is.  Shit.  Guess I'm gonna have to give them to someone.  Anyone wear a 7 1/2 and really likes PANK?  Maybe I send them to Pisser.  They have lots of  shiny  jewels on them.   I love shiny things.   Sometimes, I am  shiny  myself.  I won't have "made it" until Who Hymn posts a trivia post about me.  This is not a hint, this is blatant, overt subliminal suggestion (I know, but I  like  contradicting myself).  This is how much I Really Don't Give A Freakin' Shit:  We're leaving in like, 30 minutes, and I haven't put on fresh perfume, haven't fucking brushed my teeth (and I do this about five times a day, it's an  obsession  with me), haven't changed out of the goofy outfit I wore to work today (which I spilled Diet Coke on).  Haven't even LOOKED at what I look like.  I can only imagine.  And you know what?  Tonight's the night more guys will hit on me over other nights when I actually   try   looking fabulous.

        Sexy Jaden  :  I must disagree with you.   urlLink Sangria is    NOT   Satan's Sauce ,  urlLink   VODKA    is.  But Sangria is  much  prettier  .  Why is Blogspot flashing banners at the top of my blog about   alcohol  ???  I'm confused.  It's not like there's any mention of it in here.  Huh.  Vicente is out having cocktails with another female from work.  I was going to join them.  But, since it's raining and I've had like six accidents in rain, I declined.  Mary/Lisa thought I was crazy.  I think I would be crazy if I drove my front-heavy truck in this weather.   urlLink Pisser , you don't  really  miss the rain.    Do  you ?  I wonder if anyone would notice if I just  didn't show up  in San Antonio this week?  Mary/Lisa is already pissed that I'm leaving Friday night.  It's my  Four Year Non-Anniversary of Meeting Vicente  this weekend.  Plus, my friends are playing four times this week...I  have  to be home.  And the Byron.  Besides, I have Thursday night to get rowdy and drunk with the Girls From San Antonio.  See, Pissed Kitty, you should have stayed a bit longer...  Good news:  My man just called (my  shirt  man) and the PJs are in!  Just in time for me to shamelessly whore myself in SA.  How exciting.  Like Bunny, whom I copy constantly and try to emulate my life after, this post is about nothing.  De nada.  A lot of crappish bullshit.  Like just about every other occasion I enter Blogger,  I have  NOTHING  TO SAY .  Except for this:  No one at work believed me when I told them "snarky" was a real word.  Now I've been dubbed The Queen Of The Snarky Bitches and everyone is going to try to use "snarky" in at least one conversation this week.  "irritable or short-tempered" - I can live with this.

      Last night's dream:  I looked in the mirror and there was a huge   bubble   on my right eyeball.  Not quite Donnie Darko but almost.  I pulled at the bubble.  Everyone was saying, "No!  It will get infected" or some such bullshit.  The bubble resisted.  And then, quite suddenly, the bubble slid off into my hand.  It was a contact the size of a silver dollar, the one that went "missing" a couple weeks ago.  The contact had stuck itself on my right eyeball like some barnacle and refused to let go.  But perserverance won out, and the pancake contact was dead.  Now  what the fuck  does  that  dream mean?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      The dogs are slightly psychotic this evening.  Rainman is sitting on my lap after having a frightening bout of acid reflux (at least, that's what it looked like).  He's never  really  okay unless he's right up his momma's ass.  Snarky was nice enough to get down off my lap when Buzzy started hyperventilating or whatever he was doing.  I think he gets to licking too fast and gets choked.  No nasty comments, please.  This is  my dog  you're talking about!  Crotch Dog ran off to no doubt antagonize his bitchy sister.  No wait, she just trolled in.  I think she may be pouting due to losing  Lap Seniority .  I'm curious as to how people will answer this...   1)  Five favorite songs:  Only five?  Okay, "Lithium" (Nirvana), "Closer" (NIN), "Interstate Love Song" (STP), "Le Freak" (Chic) and "Ring of Fire" (Johnny Cash).   2)  Five favorite movies:  "Donnie Darko" (was there any doubt here people?), "Next Stop Wonderland", "Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her", "Sliding Doors" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."   3)  Five favorite foods:  Grilled corn on the cob, fresh tomatoes, my mom's Thanksgiving dressing, my mom's pinto beans and  frozen cheese pizza .   4)  Five favorite people:  (Not in order, so don't go gettin' all   pissy   or anything) Vicente, my mom, Mary/Lisa, Dianne and myself   5)  Five favorite cartoon characters:  Shaggy on Scooby Doo, Daffy Duck, Underdog, Mighty Mouse and those two weird little ravens that walked along and would bob in sync every now and then (some old 30s cartoon)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      The first time I heard this song, I absolutely hated it.  After a couple listens, though, it's got this kind of "Co-stanza!" quality.  It almost reminds me of a song from the 80s.  God, the guys singing that song were probably born around the same time I learned how to drive.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Vicente checked the calendar at Dada.  So did Smokin' Joe.  I guess, though, Club Dada changed their minds at the last minute and decided to nix Open Mike Night and put it off until next weekend.  So Vicente, Fab D and I traipsed down to West Village and ate outside at Paris.  Beautiful night.   Lots of dogs.    Too much cheese.   Vicente was almost convinced to play hooky this morning and stay in bed with me.  Unfortunately, our fucking jobs always seem to get in the way.  He did stay long enough to witness Snarky Bitch's  dementia  concerning feeding time.  Nico (no longer Sparky Jr. but now named Crotch Dog) falls for it every time.  Rainman just sat on my leg staring into space.  I'm really out of things to say (incredible, I know) so for once, I'll end it early.  I would suggest you check out Bun's latest post, and let me know what songs you would have played at your funeral.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Or so says  donniedarkdodotcom .  I must be  insane  (refrain from commenting on this, please) since I am awake at 8:46 on a Sunday morning (the babies wouldn't let me sleep).   Mucho gorgeous Vicente  is slumbering in my bed.  I don't dare go back in there for fear of waking him up (not because he'd be angry, just because he never gets enough sleep).  Symphony today, with the maternal parental unit.  I'm only excited because she absolutely loves that shit.  She can't wait to hear the "favorite" Rachmaninoff concerto.  (I prefer the lesser known # 1)   Dada  tonight, and I'm hard-pressed to find the time to do assigned work since I slept all day long yesterday, and chased the night away with vodka and Fab D.   Why, oh why, does my boss think I have no life ?  I hate the "you're single with no kids, you must not have anything to do on the weekend" concept.   Fuck!   I have mucho more to do than you simply because I-am-single-with-no-kids.  This is why I chose this route in life:  kids = responsibility.  I have enough problemos with responsibilities as it is, without having an actual human being thrown in the mix.  (Sigh)   I love kids , I really do.  Just when they're other people's kids.  So shoot me.  At least I'm not wrecking another life with coat hangers and " go getcher momma a beer " scenarios.  How white trash would  that  be?  Mary/Lisa got a new navel ringie thingie that says, " Okay ."  Much better than Edgar's tongue ring that says, " Let's fuck ."  Subtlety, mi amigos.   Learn it, know it, use it.   I should come with a warning label:   Caution, contents  flammable  .  Yesterday morning, while languishing in bed with  my lovely V , we decided upon new names for the babies:   Sparky, Jr  (Nico, Mr. Aloof Canine),  Snarky Bitch  (my precious Sadie) and  Rainman  (poor,  confused  Buzzy).  Rainman stares at walls when you're speaking to him.  Sadie has some kind of eating disorder in which she saves her food until the others are finished, then guards it like some  demon from hell .  Sparky Jr. is just fabulous...a spitting image of what my  tragic hero  could have been.  He's got the personality and the wherewithall to stand up to  Bitch Momma , and he knows exactly how to pin me down in all the emotional places.  My bebes are   spoiled fucking rotten  .  I had  61 grams of carbs  in  one meal  yesterday.  That is absolutely   terrifying  .  One frozen quick-fix, and I'm over the limit for the next three days.  Weight loss is a constant battle.  Even when you lose what you wanna lose, it's still lurking about, tempting you with fried potatoes and extra sour cream.  I'm off now to watch satellite TV and  destroy some more brain cells  before lunch.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Eggs.  And people speaking Spanish.  And an interview with Vogue.  Those were my dreams last night/this morning.  One dream entirely about ordering five eggs over easy at Denny's (must have been the crack I smoked last night).  Another in which everyone around me was speaking in Spanish, and I didn't understand because I only took one semester of it in college, and that was too many years and too many cocktails ago.   The Vogue interview dream was the best.   I can only remember a little bit, and it was this:  I'm talking to Diane Sawyer, who suddenly works for Vogue, and she wants to interview me.  Por que, I could not tell you.  But I'm on my cell phone in the most fabulous shop I've ever seen (there were items literally hanging from the ceiling, tempting me to buy one of everything) and I'm arguing with Diane, who tells me it's "business casual here at Vogue."  I think that if that bitch wants to interview me, I can wear whatever the hell I want to.  So I buy hot pink capris (who would have guessed, right Bun?) with a flared leg, since that is what Diane told me  not  to wear.  And a pink, feather-covered bustier.  And lots of sparkly makeup.  I show up looking  fabulous .  And quite like a drag queen.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Thank God I don't have the webcam RDM gave me set up yet.  My eyeliner drifted a few centimeters away from my lashes, I'm wearing white Min Pin boxer shorts and a pink tank top, and I have on the only pair of decent (well,  used to be decent ) glasses I have.  Which the three  darling  Min Pins I love ate.  So one arm kinda scratches my head and is slightly shorter in length than the other.  They sit lopsided on my face.   Cute.   I really should take a picture.  DFW bloggers - go see  Polyphonic Spree  at the Richardson Wildflower Festival tomorrow night!  Vicente and I will be there, along with Bunny and Zero and I'm sure lots of others.  How juvenile am I?  When choosing my outfit this morning, like every other morning, I also consider my panties.  So I decided to wear my Felix the Cat underwear.  So now, all day long, when I go to pee, I look down and see not one   pussy  , but  TWO .  Every hetero male's dream, right?  It's just usually they're on two separate bodies.  My boss gave me her Rapid Rewards ticket that is about to expire.  I've left Vicente enough messages on his cell phone that his voicemail is now full.   I WANNA GO TO NEW ORLEANS.   Trouble is, we'd have to take the 9:10 flight back Sunday morning because we're taking my mother to the symphony at two, where I will have a chance to catch up on my lack of sleep from the night before.  His ticket would only be $127 and we could bombard the  Big Easy  with  nongirlfriend !  That's a pretty  scary  thought.  I've decided to postpone blowing off my engagement.  In fact, I do indeed think that I should throw that  engagement party  I was mulling over in my head.  Mary/Lisa thinks I need to.  I am open to suggestions for places to register, but I'm sure it will end up being  Sephora .  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I am becoming a  senior citizen , early on.  I went to bed by eight last night, woke up at three, then again at five.  Maybe I just don't need that much sleep.  I missed two calls from Vicente, who is in lovely Columbus, Ohio until tonight.  And we are heading out to  urlLink Wildflower Festival , Bun.  Around 9.  Call me when you get out there.  I don't wanna go to San Antonio next week.   Four fucking days.   If I were going with friends or something, that might be diff.  But work?   Grrr .  At least I know that I will always get to room with the person I choose (since I played God and divvied out the rooms).  They got a deal where we have happy hour for two hours every night (included in the room charge).  This could end  badly .  Besides that, I'm missing the Byron Nelson.  That's where Vicente and I met, sort of (waiting for a tram for the BN, but close enough).  Four years ago.  Wow.  Sorry, got  lost in thought  there for a sec.  I didn't realize it had been that long ago.  But it was.  I've been in this house for four years, got  Sparky  the year before I bought it.  He would have been six this year.   Forewarning:   I may "disappear" for a few days in June.  It's beginning to dawn on my  clueless mind  that it'll be a year next month, and I'm making necessary plans to prep for the anniversary.  Those of you who wish to judge me or call me a fool for being upset over a dog,  fuck  off  .   I've come a long way in a year.   Last summer, I don't even remember past June 17th.  I know I was a little better in the fall, then crashed and almost-burned in October.  Who  wasn't  worried about me last year?  That was something I felt bad about for a long time.  I kept saying, " 2004 will be a better year ," and it has been, but only because I learned how to deal with it all in a better way.  But on to happier subjects:   Friends  is over, finally.  I watched about three episodes of that show and never really got into it.   Seinfeld  is more my style, at least early Seinfeld is.  That's right, kiddos, the DVDs come out this December.  I already have them on CD (courtesy of The  Nicest , Vicente) but you know I'm gonna have to get me some of that.  I just realized I have an hour to get ready (airport run this a.m.)...

       Would you even care?   I'm really wanting  Velvet Revolver  to come to town, in the guise of   Stone Temple Pilots  .  What the fuck happened?  What happned to  Sublime  when that guy died?  I can understand  Nirvana .   Dave Grohl  did okay ( more than okay,  I love him  ).   Blind Lemon  - only one song that I know of.  Think of what could have happened if the  H  didn't enter the scene.  It's like anything else...Gia, Kurt, my baby (and Bunny's) Scottie, WHOEVER.   HUGS not drugs , kids.  Just drink like the rest of us, k?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I had to go to work so I didn't really get to "get into" my last topic.  This seems to be one of genuine interest to at least three of us, so  what the hell , let's do it.   What do your friends say about you behind your back, if asked to describe you?   You know it won't be the same thing they say to you, so wouldn't it be interesting to somehow find out?  Or would it hurt too much to know the "truth"?  Perception is a strange thing.  And my perception of others' perceptions of me usually ends up wrong.  I'm hardest on and least accepting of myself, that's possibly why.  I should take the advice of that 70s tune, which says "Do your time, pay the price for everything you've done wrong, baby...then come home for good."  (Sloan, I think it is.)  I have trouble with that.   It seems I keep getting stuck on doing time .  Like Fab D once wrote in here about me, "She apologizes too much."  What if you could be a proverbial fly on the wall and follow someone around all day long?  Even with all that you would learn,  you wouldn't be inside their head , so you wouldn't know the full story.  (Be thankful you cannot crawl inside  my  head, as there isn't enough room for any more up there, thank you.)  Myself, I don't want to know the   real   you - I prefer what you care to present to me.  Maybe I just like living in denial.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       Bunny 's comment on  urlLink Zero's blog   about the true "you" behind the blog is quite thought-provoking.  And true.  At least 99% true.  I think some people show their true colors, but just touch them up before posting.  Of course, there's always my "ghost posts" that magically disappear the next morning (typically because I haven't thought about what I was writing and figured I'd really offend someone).  My hyperactive imagination rings clearly in my I-wonder-if-Vicente-is-mad-at-me posts.  I thought about this for a while this morning, as I wondered why the fuck he hasn't called this morning and realized, You pathetic git, he's out of town and busy and don't you have anything better to do than be paranoid?  You might think I've smoked a little too much of the happy grass and it's affected my sensibilities (what little there were to begin with).  Or maybe I'm just constantly hormonal (that would explain a lot).  Or perhaps that I haven't really gotten over my depression stemming from last summer and I'm just band-aiding it by chemical alterations via P and/or V.  I try to portray myself as I am but I fail miserably.  Why is it so important that we "edit" ourselves on here?  Those of you who really know me, and who love me, love my imperfections as part of the entire package.  Or else you just deal with it, quite the same way I deal with yours.  But Bunny's comment made me think about who I really am, and what you cannot see in here.  I don't know.  But damn it, Bunny, now I'll be thinking about it all day.

      I'm sitting at my desk, eating my  Stinky Cheese Salad  (I love feta!) and thinking of  Timmy .  Timmy likes to tease me about posting so often.  Dawnie thinks Timmy's hilarious.  So does Timmy.  (Actually, so do I, but I have to jab right back, you know?)   This entire post is dedicated to  Timmy .   In fact, besides the Stinky Cheese Salad remark, the entire post will be about Timmy, in some respect.  I'm going to start wearing a bracelet that reads "WWTD?"  That will be my new philosophy.  Timmy will also have to approve all future Sephora purchases prior to me clicking that "Place Order" icon.  (" Place Order "  Have you heard more beautiful words?   Except for maybe "Timmy"? )  My non-BF is out of town for three days, so since I'll be lonely with just myself and the three babies, I think I'll take my Timmy Doll to bed with me.  Vicente doesn't like it when I do that, so I have to sneak it in or wait until he's not there.  I often talk to my Timmy Doll.   Occasionally, my Timmy Doll talks back.   I really must run now, blogosphere.  Just the mention of Sephora made me want to Place (my) Order.  Timmy, you will be receiving email with packing list for your approval.   This one's for  you , Timmy!   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

You are both officially off my Christmas list.  Not really.  Anyway, for the   shoes  :   urlLink My precious   Bellow     I also like the Clear Strike sunglasses.  Too bad my bday's gone.  Oh, but   Bunny  's is rapidly approaching!  So buy her the shoes and she and I can share.  7 1/2 wide.  I've got flat, wide feet.  Bunny, is that okay with you?

      After three days of saying I was going to go grocery/etc. shopping at SWM, I broke down and did it last night.  I believe the most effective form of contraception is going to Wal Mart at any given time of day or night.  My ovary cringes and my thighs seem to draw in closer together.  For days afterwards, I have horrific nightmares that the rugrats I saw (heard) on aisle 9B are in reality mine.   And people wonder why I cannot sleep at night .  Well,  $191.87  later, I crawled back home.  Granted, I got a shitload of stuff I really needed, plus the pedicure kit will actually save me money in the long run (if I don't lose a toe or two before I master the foot shaver).  And I found this cool bikini-line electric razor I am somewhat nervous about using (all those tiny teeth near my kitty cat).  Oh, and since it seems that all of my panties have  holes in their crotches  from my dogs   snacking   on them, I got a few pairs of thongs.  Normally, I'm a VS kind of girl, but $$$ is tight with starting my own business and owing my non-BF out the wazoo for funding it.  To begin paying him back, two of the undies were  Felix the Cat thongs  (he loves FTC).  I honestly don't know why I bother - he just yanks those things off me anyway.  I don't like the word, " thong ."  It looks funny in print and feels awkward rolling off my tongue.  Say it to yourself over and over.  Thong, thong, thong, thong, thong.   See what I mean ?  No chance to talk to Dawnie about the incident at the engagement party.  Very curious to see how that turns out.  Stories like that make me glad I am no longer married.   NO, I AM NOT ENGAGED.   It was a joke, an off-handed, smart-ass remark.  But if I were to get engaged, I'd buy myself a nicer ring.  Probably an emerald.  And I'd still wear it on my  Fuck You Finger .   Thank you for all your congratulations, though.   I'm really surprised that no one questioned my sanity regarding that step in the wrong direction.  Perhaps maybe the sanity question has already been answered within your minds anyway, and you just chalk it up to one more fucked-up thing the Chicken has decided to do.    NOT QUITE BLONDE ENOUGH YET  , I am going lighter tonight after work.  One day, I'll process my hair into extinction.  (God, I hope not.)    Maybe I should try getting some more sleep.  Many thanks to my mom and dad (who don't read this, so why bother writing it?) for putting up my new bathroom cabinet (hell,  for putting it together , I certainly wasn't going to do it).    Now I have room for more Sephora acquisitions...    Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      The natives (dogs) are  restless .  Exhausted myself to the point of falling asleep as soon as I hit the bed, I woke up (and woke up poor Vicente, too) about 45 minutes ago.  Well, he's now off to ZZZZ land and I'm still wide awake.  I thought  hot monkey sex  (or sex of any kind) was supposed to make you  sleepy ?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I'm an  idiot , so kill me.   I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO POST A LINK.   I forgot, okay?  The shoes,  oh my God, the shoes, you  have  to see them .  Words cannot express the love that I have for these shoes.  I just can't link the  fucking  things.  I noticed that Timmy, Bunny and Who Hymn did not offer to   save the day  .  Shame on you!   Shame ,  shame !  Vicente (now asleep in my bed) says I post  mean things  about him.  You all know it's pretty much  tongue-in-cheek , but he takes this shit literally.  Thinks the blogosphere hates him.   What.ever.   He puts up with my drama-queen-shit, he's gotta be a good guy.   V has a goddamned guitar lesson on Friday night.   We are so going to go to the  Wildflower Festival , even if it ends up being 10:00 at night when we get there!  Hey, Bun, I purchased  illegal-foot-scraping-thingie  today at Super Wal Mart.  Just about took off my left arm trying to use it.  If you see me hobbling around, with nubby toes and a stump for a foot, just remember:   Kids, don't try this at home .  So I post too often, eh  Timmy ?  I've always wanted to be compared to Robert Downey, Jr. and now,  I've  arrived  .   Non-BF  is headed for the lovely Columbus, Ohio, boil-on-the-arse-of-humanity.  Sorry Ohioans.  It's true.  He's there for three days.  Now one would think I'd be all rowdy and non-GF'ing as much as possible, right?  Not me.  I'm the loyal, devoted non-GF (what an   idiot  ).  I expect some sort of present from recent travels (he's going to Virginia next week, and I want a major supply of tobacco from that excursion).  For those of you who believe some of my posts, let me correct everyone who is misguided here:   I LOVE Vicente .  He pisses me off, he makes me irritated sometimes, I think I ought to jack-slap that bitch, but I love him very much.  I don't wanna know what he says about me, though.  Keep that to yourselves.

      Found out where  Mystery Weekend  was spent...Oakland, CA.  Seems Banky flew them both out to some party and then they went to a baseball game.  Flew home at 12:30 this morning (2:30 our time).  V is on no sleep.  I am skeptical.  Some of the phone numbers programmed into his cell phone are from that area (yes, I looked, a long time ago when I had every reason to).   Men are deceitful , especially when they go out of their way to tell you what a "good boy" they were all weekend.   I'm hosing him down with Lysol the next time I see him .  (Dawnie, no comments here, I know what you're thinking.)  This weekend, I discovered there really  is  such a thing as   too much sleep  .  I'm dizzy right now, and I am sure it is because I spent most of the weekend in a horizontal fashion, and not for a good reason.  If I'm going to spend that much time lying down, shouldn't I be  getting laid  or something?   Day Three Of Engagement  - This is really getting boring.  I'm seriously considering breaking it off.  I have major commitment issues.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      No, I am not  drunk .   I'm high on  life .   And the fact that I slept away about 75% of the day, unless I stay up until two o'clock in the morning.  Bunny's music-memory post brought back high school days and always feeling like an outsider.  I think aural memories are stronger for me, but then, I cannot smell most of the time because  I fucking smoke those goddamned cigarettes !  (Set date to quit.  Just  thinking  about it makes me grumpy.  Can you  tell ?)   Engagement Party  last night was a  smashing success .  No additional bruises, I remained in my PJs, the babies got a lot of loving from everyone (even though Jason is not a  pet person ), Fab D and I made fun of people and laughed our asses off.  Yep, just like high school again.  The thing with this  Engagement  (and yes, I do have to use  Bold Title Case )...well I think I'm opting for a long one.  No need to rush into anything, right?  A few more engagement parties should be held.  And I'm all up for a bridal shower, you know,  just in case anyone wants to  throw me one   (or two).  I'll be registered at  Sephora  and  Express .   Run out and  PURCHASE ME THINGS !   I feel like I forgot to do something and don't even have a clue what that something might be.  The inventory is still pending (I'm thinking about it, k?).  I slept through cleaning and shopping for groceries, but I certainly didn't  forget  them.  My self-pedicure is done.  (I have precious sparkly purple polish on my stubby little toes.)  Need to make lunch for tomorrow, nothing but peanut butter tempts me.  Bought some couscous but I'm afraid to make it.  Need to take a shower and shave my nether regions (too many facts for you?  oh so sorry ).  Had fascinating conversation with my dad, which I started by telling him, "And no, I am not drunk," this time without lying.  Successfully stayed away from  Sephora  this weekend (even though there are a few more hours left).   The classic underachiever:  I accomplished a  whole lotta nothing  in the past 48 hours.   Right in line with me  losing my mind and becoming engaged , I have been officially diagnosed with the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (by Dr. www.webmd.com).  Where was I?  OH YEAH,  Vicente  is still not back from Banky's  Surprise Saturday Night .  I  MUST  be non-girlfriend, since all I'm really worried about is him calling too late and waking up my ever-sleepy-these-days ass.  Or that he's been in some horrific accident and I'll be getting a call from a hospital somewhere. Oh, and that  HE NEVER TOLD ME WHERE HE WAS GOING .  Okay, so it bothers me.  Just don't tell him.  He doesn't read this blog anyway.   "You want the truth?  You can't  handle  the truth!"   Sorry, had to throw a little Jack your way.  I've been pondering this (for about twenty seconds):  Since I have such a close (albeit abusive) relationship with my liver, I really need to  give it a name .  Am open for suggestions but am leaning toward Leroy.  Or Beulah.   PLEASE POST POSSIBLE NAMES FOR MY LIVER.   The winner gets a t-shirt.   Seriously .  I'm losing Mary/Lisa to " the country ."  I better keep working where she does or   I'll never see her again  .  Already I am sad.  That sistah-girrrrlfriend helped me through all sorts of shit.  Anyone who could put up with me for nine years deserves to be  sainted  and have a  national holiday in their name .  God love her, and she's still   sane  .  Amazing.  One day, I fear I will wake up and everyone will be speaking Non-Girlfriend.  You know, like in "Being John Malkovich"?   I so prefer Pisser Speak to NG Speak.   Or  Bunny Speak .  Think of the  fun  you could have speaking Pisser or Bunny.  I'd really hate to see what you'd get if you ordered   Pisser   in a restaurant.  I don't dare even think about the  Bunny Factor .  Oh, here's a tidbit to knock you off your virtual feet:   What the fuck if I'm PREGNANT?   Lately, I've been having dreams about giving birth (okay,  nightmares ) and I've had some really strange cravings.  Now I am wanting to  name my liver ??  Plus all the throwing up I've been doing lately.  (Oh wait, that's  all the time .  Never mind.)  Can you imagine what sort of  Spawn of Satan  I would  pop out ?  That poor bebe will hit the world clutching a Marlboro Ultra Light in one chubby little hand and a dirty vodka martini in the other.  Thank God   my ovary   doesn't want to cooperate with the natural flow of things.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I don't know...it's just a line from some stupid movie I watched on  LMN .  I've officially been booted out of the den and the remote has been taken away from me.  Trouble is, those movies are so  bad , they're   fascinating  .  It's a sickness, I know.   I've got a hole in my condom pocket.   At least, that's what I think the little square pocket on my VS jammies is for.  I don't know what else you would put in there, except maybe lip gloss.  There are some people getting  way too dressed up for sex , let me tell you.  I'd end up rolling over on it during my sleep, and wake up looking like something from a  really bad snuff flick .  We were talking about dreams last night (after I woke up from an entire day of sleeping, brought to you by  miscalculated HOTD experiment ).  I had some really strange dreams yesterday.  Vodka will do that to you.  I slept all day today, too, and then watched that stupid movie and started on another.  I'm turning into a college student, without the studying and early 20s body.  What a sad state.  At least I wasn't  hungover  like  Dawnie .  Guess I need to shuffle my fat ass off to Super Wal Mart for some  Super Shopping .  Had to feed the babies scrambled eggs today since I ran out of dog food.  Not that they're complaining but jeez, I don't want them to get used to that or anything.

      I wonder where all the  pirates  went?  It'd be nice to have a few around these days.  Sans parrots, those sqawky obnoxious  wanna-be s.  I pretty much wasted yesterday, the  Cleaning and What-Not Day .  (I wasn't   wasted  ,  I  wasted  it .)  I won't explain.  And Vicente,  the UPS stores WERE NOT OPEN .  At 10 p.m., Fab D and I power-cleaned the kitchen.  It's much like exercise: if I have a co-conspirator, I will do it religiously.  If left to my own pathetic, no-discipline accords, I'll fail miserably.   Hell, I won't even try .   Fabulous Bunny  had a  Donnie Darko  moment and that's gotta make you love her more than you already do.  She's right: the weather in DFW was atrocious yesterday, and now, to confuse all of God's good creatures (and bad alike), it's back to late-March standards, weather-wise.   I would like to spend the day on my couch , watching cooking shows and bad Lifetime movies ( I knew the goddamned satellite dish was a mistake! ).  Instead, I must do inventory, clean my bathrooms and do a couple loads of laundry.  Smite  John Cheever  for his portrayal of American life in the 30s.  Even though it was  depression ,  cocktails  and  doom-and-gloom Depression Era sadness , there was always a housekeeper and the mothers always made dinner for their young-uns before the adults ate.   I was flammable last night.   After waking up at an hour that most people prepare all evening for, there I was in all my glory and Rod-Stewart-hair, cleaning the fucking kitchen with a beautiful Fab D.  I, on the other hand, had not bothered to even  comb my hair , having had  major caffeine withdrawal  yesterday.  Plus, as Mary/Lisa put it, I was intox (from HOTD), early on in the day.  Don't  ever,  ever   believe your  evil younger brother  when he asks you, "  Hair of the dog?  "   JUST SAY NO.   Make Nancy Reagan happy  for once .  I have this faux solitaire that I like to wear on occasion, and when asked about it last night, I told Fab D I was  engaged to myself .  Simply because I'm the only person I'd ever want to marry.  Again.  So I wear the ring on my   Fuck You Finger   and dodge questions that way.   Cluttered Thoughts Of An  Un-Sunshine Mind     It was so much easier as a child .  This is  really  what I worried about:  Amy and Angela, telling all my secrets (which were BORING); being picked last for volleyball (never happened); looking like an innocent child while all other girls around me were looking "grown up" (this really did happen, and yes, sometimes, I still look like a child); worrying some teacher would single me out when I didn't do my homework (which was quite often, the no-homework, not the singling-out).   Now I worry about:   mortgage payments; cancer; my babies (aka, the dogs); my parents' mortality; my own mortality; my luuurve relationship; my waistline; the wangas under my upper arms; illness; returning to the Dating World; fear of heights; fear of bugs; lack of control re: everything; how am I going to pay this bill?; where did all my money go???;  what the fuck  is this world coming to?, ad nauseum.   You get the picture.   So I say,  let's go back to innocence , and PBJ sandwiches, and kickball, and games of "Mother may I?" and eating glue.  My problem is this:   I want the freedom of adult life combined with the lack of responsibility of childhood.    Yeah, and who  doesn't ?   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       I can tell you this:   mine's sliding  downhill  quickly.  Maybe I can rope Paddy Mac and Jason into buying me some bfast when they go out, and so I don't actually have to leave the house, making them bring it back to me.   Ahem .  Vicente is off on some  fabulous adventure  with Banky.  He didn't have any details except that he needed "a change of clothes and a toothbrush."   Or so he said .  I am suspicious.  And I am also somewhat envious: I would like to be able to travel  that lightly , and suppose I could; however, the rest of civilization would be permanently  scarred for life  so it's best I bring along my  two bags of make-up and hair products .  (In reality, it is only one, but two sounded much more high maintenance.)  Truth be told, I don't look awful without makeup (Mary/Lisa tries to get me to go  la naturel  but I  must  have my eyebrows and lashes!).  I just look sixteen.  Especially with the Mount Vesuvius zit on my cheek.  (Boo Boo Zap is taking its own sweet time about destroying that volcanic emergence.)  Today is  Clean Up and Organization Day  at my house.  I'm off to a  swell  start, rolling out of bed at 10:15, talking on the phone for a half hour, then blogging.  (Isn't it insane that the word 'blog' became a  gerund ?)  I really don't wanna start.  And I'm looking for ways out of it.  Farming out the work to the roommie won't work (he  likes  to live this way).  Also, momma ain't go no money for baby's shoes, let alone a housekeeper.  And with my luck,  Hazel the Second  would show up and I'd have to kill her.  Then dispose of her remains in my backyard.  Without my nosy neighbor noticing.  Then, inevitably, my dogs would smell her, dig her up and feast on the decaying remains.  So I guess I just have to clean the fucking place myself.   Damn.

       FIRST OF ALL:    Thanks to all the support and empathy for those little ones in Tulsa.    DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN   Bunny was stalking me via the telephone today.  It was great fun - I wish I had been home to catch her calls.   HI, MY NAME IS CHICKEN AND I AM A SHOPAHOLIC   I bought two more pairs of shoes today.  I almost bought a watch.  And I don't even wear watches.   ONLY TWENTY-THREE DAYS TO GO   Shit, one would think I was getting the chance to meet Scott Weiland or something.  I've decided that I really like that song "Slither" and might actually purchase a CD for the second time in two years.  Vicente does not care for Velvet Revolver but then again, V doesn't always know what he is talking about.  Sorry, Vicente, but  it is true .  You dragged me to that Sigur Ros concert that time.  Remember?   I fell asleep STANDING UP.   Okay, STP lyrics seemed to always have water and dogs in them.  Note how "Slither" also has water in the lyrics, this time "holy water."  My favorite reference to water, though, is from "Still Remains" (a song I once considered "our" song when I first met Vicente) - "Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave."  Sounds nasty, reading it.  But when Scottie sings it, it's downright romantic.  I just hope whomever he wrote that song for doesn't take a piss when they're taking a bath.  That would be sad for Scottie.  Although I'm sure that isn't the nastiest thing he's had in his mouth.   SPEAKING OF NASTY THINGS...   Why doesn't Courtney Love just do us all a favor and overdose or something?   I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO GET ZERO FOR HIS BDAY SO I'M OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS   (Or  hints , if Zero is reading this)   OH WHAT A NIGHT   My last night with Vicente for a while.  Fellow females, please keep me busy the next month.  I'm poor as hell but I am a lot of fun at parties.  Just ask Bunny.  Or Who Hymn.  Oh, and you can all forget about that 1 a.m. post this morning.  Shhh, our little secret.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

I've got an hour to get my shit together, er, sheets together.   IT'S RAINING MEN   Or dogs.  Personally, I would choose the dogs.  They are much  nicer .

      I always loved that Night Ranger song.  Child of the 80s, so shoot me.   What the fuck  am I doing up at three?  I'd really like to show up to a meeting tipsy sometime.  Wonder what would happen?  Drinking seems to be "encouraged" at my company.  And now you all know why I'm Lush-ous Chicken.  It's kinda like when I worked for the government and we had a bar in our building.   TODAY MY PARENTS WILL HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 42 YEARS   Sounds hellish to me, but yeah, they are still together and still seem to like each other about 60% of the time.  And look at what they produced:  a daughter who has been married twice and doesn't want to do it again, nor does she want rugrats, er, children.  The insanity, I mean, the  sanctity  of marriage is alive and well.  For other people.  I cannot imagine 10 years with the same person but oh well.  My mom and dad are cute together.  Their fights are even cute.  Divorce sucks, and in a big way.  Too many people (myself included) opt for the easy way out.  But then again, had I stayed married that second time, I probably would have been dead in a year.  They should make you take some kind of test to get married.  Like, are you an idiot?  Yes, then here you are...a marriage license.   WHOA, SLOW DOWN GIRL   Guess I need to shut the fuck up about the whole matrimony thing.  And no, I am not bitter.  Just realistic.  In this ADD world we live in, how long can anything last?   I MISS VICENTE   I fucking hate this time of year.  Nonboyfriendless for six weeks sucks.  ABSTINENCE for six weeks sucks.  Don't suggest otherwise 'cause it ain't gonna happen.  You know what?  I take it back.  Four years with the same person hasn't been bad at all.  Vicente embraces (and encourages) the  histrionic narcisstic  side of me.  And the self-destructive side, which can be not-so-good at times.   TWENTY-FIVE DAYS UNTIL THE TANGENT UNIVERSE COLLAPSES  AGAIN    Bunny, I say we have a Donnie Darko party afterwards.  I want to dress up like Elizabeth (I think she's hot) - you can be Samantha.  Sometimes, though, I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.   GRRR   I am oh so tempted to pull an Office Space today.  I will let you know how that turns out.

      I HATE rap music.  So why do I love this song?  Having looked up the lyrics only makes it worse.   But I can't get it out of my head.   So, I survived another fucking Monday.  One-fourth of the day was spent checking on Mama Dog and her herd of puppies.  That helped.  This is why I stress:   SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS , motherfuckers.  This is her second pregnancy in a year.   OFF MY SOAPBOX   I so think we should do a  Girls And Their CHEESE: A Love Story  webring.  Who wants to design the icon?  I'm opting out because I know nothing about that shit.  Boys, any of you wish to donate your services?  (Design services, pervs - I have enough on my hands with Vicente.)   I HATE BREAKFAST MEETINGS   First of all, I always appear to be a pig because I love a big breakfast.  Second, now that I'm really trying to pay attention to where what I eat comes from, how do I know if the eggs are from chickens who have been mistreated?  Oh, kids, I looked up the codes for The Ville and I CAN have chickens.  That would only serve to drive my Min Pins more insane than they are, so I'll just have to envy my neighbor's chickens.  Maybe I could get a peacock?  Then the  Weird Factor  will be complete.  (Bunny, I think I may be able to talk Vicente into meeting us for lunch at the Meridian on Friday.)   MONKEYS, BURROS AND A COUPLE OF GOATS   I had the most disappointing grilled CHEESE sandwich today.  I went to our coffee house (as I am not a critic, I will omit names) and ordered the cacciotta (sp?) grilled CHEESE with that funky-sounding chili pepper thrown in.  Maybe it was the bread.  Maybe it was the chili.  Or the   CHEESE  .  I don't know.  But their iced Chai tea is  amazing .  I tried it for the first time with soy milk instead.  Starbucks, move the fuck   over  .   I NEED A MUSCLE RELAXER AND A MARTINI   Whatever the hell I did to my upper back, it's killing me.  Mary/Lisa had to have X-rays done today because she threw her lower back out.  What the fuck?  Are we all becoming old?  (I've had these probs since I was 14...they're just worse now.)  Well, that is it for me, fellow bloggers.  I'm about to go snuggle up to some Vermont aged white cheddar.

      Come and celebrate with me.  Gifts (makeup, shoes and/or monetary bestowments) are welcome, but more welcome is your presence.  I'm going this week to buy myself a not-wedding ring.  So  come on over , bring your friends.  Let us champion the Bride-Not-To-Be and the fact that I can still fit into my ugly-ass wedding dress from 15 years ago!

      What happens when a lazy surbuban white girl gets satellite TV?  She watches fucked up movies starring Melissa Joan Hart.   WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?   Wait, don't answer that.  I think we all already know.  I am thinking of moving to LA just long enough to get Ol' Red pimped.  If they could fix that yoga girl's piece, just think how great Ol' Red could look.  The possibilities are endless.   NAIR DO WELL   I was happy to discover that many other women are fervent about their pubic hair upkeep.  I became a little too zealous, though, and I'm gonna have to let that grow back out.  Question:  Have any of you ever dyed the nether regions?  Just curious.   MORE TO COME   It actually stopped raining in this humid, hellish Metroplex.  I'm still fucking pissed about not having Monday off, instead of next Friday.  To make matters worse, Paddy Mac has to let me and Fab D know last night that he has six weeks of vacation.  I don't even know if I am even in the black.  But the guy does work his ass off.  He just didn't need to mention he would be off work from this Thursday on through the entire next week.  Bastard.   GRAZING   I don't know why, but I feel as though I've gained 20 pounds over the weekend.  It's probably only 2 or 3, but to a recovered (somewhat) anorexic, that is the same thing.  And I'm craving pizza like hell right now...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I don't  know ...it just sounded like a good title.  Winter seems to be the "lazy" time of year for most people.  They gain a little weight, stop shaving their legs, etc etc etc.  Not me.  I shave away in the cold months.  It's summertime that I become lazy.   DON'T GET ME WRONG   I still shave.  In fact, I'm quite obsessive about shaving.  I don't really gain weight in the summer (or winter).  I just stop worrying about how I look on the weekends.   AND ALL BECAUSE OF A MAN   String me up and call me old-fashioned.  I am NOT.  I just don't go out so much when Vicente is with his son.  And I really don't know why.  Is this crazy?  Should I be out with my girlfriends, terrorizing DFW?  I want some input on this.   TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT   For me to do nothing but lounge around in my pajamas, drink copious amount of vodka and watch "Love Actually" with Fab D.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Was today extra-long or was I just having  flashbacks  from high school days?  (Truth be told, I never really did anything too bad in high school.  In fact, most people thought I was  too  straight.)   ACCORDING TO MARY/LISA, I AM A CAT, I AM A "PUSSY CAT."   No, I am not, you pasty old hag on your deathbed.  I am a Chicken.  And I will peck out your eyes if you fuck with me.   HANGIN' AROUND THE CLIFF   Yep, that's what I did today, for about 2 1/2 hours.  With Bunny and Monketo.  Bun and I had coffee-type drinkies (iced chai tea doesn't really count for coffee but oh well) and they both had these amazing raspberry scones, then we went to Vitto's, where the waitress apparently thought we had all the time in the world to have lunch.  But my boss didn't say anything.  Photos   MUST   come my way and soon, M!  Especially the Cross-Eyed Bandit photo of me, jacking some poor innocent fellow diner.   What fun we have in The Cliff!   I now have a  drawring  of a monkey, courtesy of M.  And garlic-breath to scare away the most tenacious vampire.  That bread was  heaven .   SO CLOSE YOUR EYES, FOR THAT'S A LOVELY WAY TO BE   I wanna see how many people get that song...   I HAFTA GET ME ONE OF THOSE PETER PAN SUITS   I'm off...have a fun evening.

      Or in my case, sprawled out horizontally with one dog's ass in my face.  This is what happens when I have no Benadryl, vodka or Ambien lying around (thanks, V, but you don't need sleep - you're on vacation): I woke up at least  four  times during the night, and rolled out of bed at five a.m.  Given the amount of alcohol I consume during any particular week, don't even think of suggesting Tylenol PM.  Who the fuck gets up at five in the morning?  Not me, not most days.   I FEEL AS THOUGH SOMETHING'S MISSING   And I don't know what it is.  Maybe if I had  urlLink  this  outfit , I would feel better about my life.  Or maybe I'd just take a handful of Ambien with a fifth of Jack and call it a night.    FRIDAY , NOT  CELLAR DOOR , IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE   I don't care what that famous linguist said.  It's finally here.  How fucked up is this?  For the Fourth of July holiday, my day off is next  Friday ?  WTF?  I need the day off to be that following Monday, as I'll be nursing the All-American Hangover From Hell.   BUNNY BETTER FEEL UP FOR COFFEE   Already I am yawning.  This is gonna be one a hell of a long-ass day.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      He called to tell me that he was staring at a model.   I didn't bite.   The  urlLink Bay Model  in San Francisco.  Vicente also told me I   lunge   at everyone.  Well,   shit yes  , that's how we hooked up.  And that is why I limit myself from exposure to  Unsafe Drinking Situations .   VICENTE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO NYC NEXT WEEK!   Which means I get to see him before the offspring arrives.  Yea.  I told him I would model my new shoes for him...naked.  Oh, wait, I'll be wearing the new mascara, too (of COURSE).   IF MY ROOTS WERE FROM A TREE, THERE WOULD BE A FUCKING REDWOOD ON MY HEAD   Bad, people.  Very,   very   bad.  I'm so Trailer Park right now it isn't even funny.  Just throw in a lawn jockey, add my cigarette "garden" out back, toss with a few pink flamingos and we're set.  "Go getcher momma a  beer ...and some  lotto tickets ."   PLEASE, GOD, LET PADDY MAC BRING HOME MORE ALCOHOL   I don't think anything else really needs to be said.   BUNNY, WHERE ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU IGNORING MY PHONE CALLS?

      In fine  Dedication Wednesday  tradition, the title of this post is offered up to Bunny.   PISSER HAS BEEN POSTING MORE OFTEN LATELY   Pisser must be bored at work.  Or just feeling a little more verbose these days.  WHATEVER THE REASON, I am thankful.  No one makes me laugh more than that bitch does.   And she's fucking  HOT  on top of it!    I HAVE A BAG FULL OF SHOES IN THE OTHER ROOM   I discarded all boxes and decided it would be easier to transport new shoes in one bag.  Sometimes, I dream that bags of new shoes and purses fall from the sky, and I know that God loves me, because he sends me SHOES.  SHOES should be in all caps, just like CHEESE.   BOW TO THE CHEESE   Just don't fucking touch any of mine, ya hear?   SHOPPING GALORE!   And the only  fun trip  was for SHOES.  I went to Target today, bought a shitload of cleaning supplies to try and force myself back into  Clean Mode .  That ended about 3.5 years ago, when Paddy Mac moved in.  I'm working on a system.  I'll get back to you on how that (doesn't) work.  Then to Tom Thumb.  I bought all kinds of fresh fruit and veggies that will inevitably rot in my refrigerator and then I'll get this hankering for them and discover I have a shitload of penicillin in my fridge.   Gonorrhea anyone?    YOU DON'T SEE ADS NOWADAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE RECALL, FONDLY, IMPORTANT CIGARETTE MOMENTS IN THEIR LIFE.

      "The floor doesn't make sense."  That was on a voicemail I got last night.  Giggle Chick has me nervous, so I'm revising posts again.  My Urban Decay Skyscraper Mascara in Gotham came in yesterday.  So I got to wear the L'Oreal Lash Architect for all of one day (unless UDSM sucks, but then I have a Dior sample to try, too).  I am going to continue to examine more lash choices until I find the perfect one.  Buzzy's new nickname is Bonky.  This should keep you straight when I am referring to the babies because, no, I did not get another dog.  Not  yet .  I did get a new hutch last night.  My parents found it marked 50% off and now I have one more place to pile shit I don't want to pick up and/or go through.  Good luck to Bunny.  She'll know what I mean.  Well, kids, I'm off to see the Wizard.  Wouldn't it be nice if I were really going to the Land of Oz?  Instead, I am off to work.  (Those flying monkeys always scared me.  They still do.)

      I swear, I heard at least three "Arrrr"s in that last post.  Sadie has stage fright.  Buzzy is just confused.  Nico, however, is my Sparky Jr. - my little hambone.  He'll act up anytime you want.  And even when you don't.   WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH HALOSCAN RIGHT NOW?   Lots of sighs at work this afternoon.  Tried my best to ignore it all, since I'M UP TO MY ASSHOLE AND HIGHER IN PROJECTS.  Synchronized my computer clock with my cell phone clock since my cell phone also serves as my time-piece.  I kept looking at it ( five o'clock, five o'clock, five o'clock  was my mantra since I came in early AGAIN and worked my way through lunch, and since I'm salaried and figure 8.5 hours is enough soul they can steal from me today) but then I didn't freakin' leave work until after six-thirty.  I think I will arm myself with a water pistol tomorrow and squirt people when they piss me off.   I HATE HOUSEWORK   I came up with this plan to break my goal of having a clean house that wasn't cleaned by someone else but by me down into reachable goals (as our executive coach would instruct me to do).  See, I do one room each day, then quit, and soon my house will be  SPARKLE MOTION .  In the year 2077 (in the Tangent Universe, that is).  But I'm working on it.   PISSER IS THE FUNNIEST FEMALE I HAVE YET TO ENCOUNTER (ON-SCREEN AND WELL, OFF-SCREEN, AND THEN ON-SCREEN  HERE )   I'm thinking of turning lesbian after I saw  The Photo  again. (the first one, not the second one - which looks slightly like a Captain Morgan's ad - "Put a little Captain in yeh!")  And Pisser, I do NOT believe that's accurate.  You're too cute to have moles with hairs growing out of them.   SOMEBODY STOP ME   I need to highlight my hair tonight and I've already had a vodka cocktail.  I could either turn out (a) looking lovely or (b) scaring my dogs.   Fuck it!  I'll take my chances!    I JUST SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF MYSELF!   I walked into the bathroom and my hair had this horrific Dairy Queen Head thing going on.  (I think I'll style it this way for work tomorrow.)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      No, not really.  I'm not really down, I'm not really out.  Not out of it yet.  Just a long-ass day and an early one at that.  Then, as I'm paying for Nico's shots at the vet's office, I look down and see a medical history folder.  I'm assuming it's the poor old soul who I missed (thank God) going back to be put down.  His name is Sparky.  Christ, that tore my mother up more than it did me.  I don't know why, except that lately I've been thinking how miserable he must have been that last year.  Just don't let me near a copy of The Rainbow Bridge or I'll have a fucking breakdown.   ALL IS WELL IN THE WORLD OF POULTRY   Got to talk to Vicente today, who had the best Father's Day with his son.  Now he is off to vacation at Yosemite (that bastard) and then back to NYC to misbehave while on business (rat bastard).  I'm stuck here in the hood, wondering what exciting things I can cook up for this weekend.  I might even leave the house again (see, Bun? I do actually get out sometimes)   SPEAKING OF COMMERCIALS, PISSER   I like the United Health Care commercial where people "don't always use common sense."  ESPECIALLY the one where those women go diving for the bridal bouquet and fall into the ocean.  Heh heh.  Serves them right.  I always let it fall to the floor if someone has the audacity to actually make me stand up in that crowd.   MARRIAGE?  NO THANKS, I'D RATHER PUT MY RIGHT HAND IN THIS RUSTY KITCHEN MEAT GRINDER, THANK YOU.   You get married to my second ex, you won't worry about the afterlife.  Hell can't be much worse.   NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,   I'm gonna go watch "Matlock."  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I've always heard it said that alcohol is a truth serum of sorts.  That cannot be said about me.   When I am drunk...   ...I think  everyone  is cute,  especially  me    ...I become more fascinating in my own head than I am in reality  ...I will tell you bold-faced lies and make up stories just to fuck with you (ask Vicente)  ...I'll fall into flower beds and think it's funny  ...I'll kiss you but it won't mean anything (ask a lot of people)  ...I'll confess things that never really happened  ...I'll probably act up, but it won't mean anything, either  Keep this in mind - you can't believe a goddamned thing I say when I am drunk - most certainly "I love you" or "Wanna fuck?"

      Went swimming with Bunny and Monketo last night.  Pouring that Skyy into my mango snowcone was a slight mistake.  Especially after eating that bean dip and those huge M&Ms.  What was I thinking?  I don't think I was.   Giggle Chick  has scared me into deleting several posts from this past week.  Sorry, Bun, but I'm a Chicken shit.   LAUNDRY STILL UNDONE   But I'm doing it now.  Full-blown headache from the Mango Surprise last night still lingering behind my right eye.  I am craving a pizza (now that I am no longer urping - sorry Bunny, about the sick bag incident in your car) and I don't feel like getting dressed so I'm gonna call Mr. Jim's.  If you can't eat pizza from NYC, Mr. Jim's is the next best thing.  They make the best thin crust cheese pizza, period.  At least around here they do.   CHEESE PIZZA   Those two little words that mean so much to this girl.   MYSOGYNISTIC BASTARDS   This is for that shit who followed  urlLink Dianarchy  around, and anyone else out there like him.   Fucking  pigs  .   TO FAB D:  SORRY FOR NOT GOING LAST NIGHT - I JUST REALLY WANTED TO SWIM   I wish you would have joined us.  I didn't even wear a swimsuit.  (No, it was not  that  kind of party.  I wore my cheerleading shorts and a nongirlfriend t-shirt.  Pervs.)   TO DO   I hate fucking "to do" lists.  They are counter-productive since I don't usually end up completing all the items on them, and then I feel like shit for being such a slacker that I watched "Caddyshack" and blogged instead of folding towels and cleaning my bathroom.  1) Buy more Tide 2) Buy more dog treats (again) - and I wonder why my babies are slightly, er, "chunky"? 3) Write long overdue thank you note 4) Eat pizza 5) Try not to throw up pizza 6) Watch another mindless movie 7) Better yet, read a mindless magazine while watching a mindless movie 8) Stay away from Sephora 9) Pay my water bill 10) Make headache go away 11) Play with the babies, who are pouting in the other room 12) Cry, because it feels like someone drove a nail through my head 13) Clean kitchen and fold those goddamned towels 14) Miss Vicente 15) REALLY miss Vicente  Fuckitall, I think I'll just go take a nap.

      Just how many times did  urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick  register herself on  Blog Snob ?  Why is it that  every time I come in here  to  obsessively check for comments , she's there?  Yeah, she's  hot .  She's also like 19 and obsessed with beheading.  I really, truly do NOT want to read about Iraq anymore.  And I don't want to be serious in here, because I have to do that far too often in my "real life."   AND BY THE WAY, DON'T CALL ME "STUPID"   I am not.  Nor am I ignorant (either by accident or on purpose, even though I didn't know what "Chola" was, but I'm not into Street Speak).  I simply do not care to fill my head with horrifying current events.  I prefer the shiny, happy ones where the dog gets rescued, the man wins the lottery before declaring bankruptcy and the long-lost couple are reuinted.  I'm depressed enough as it is with what really happens.  So I'm going to keep my blogging to:  makeup, shoes, clothes, hair, boys, fun, alcohol and my lovely Min Pins.

       THINGS I HAVE NOTICED ABOUT BLOGGERS (Myself Included)    1)  We are addicted to it, often checking for comments several times a day.   2)  We like to see pictures of ourselves up, even bad ones, like Leif's (that fake picture, not the real one - he is actually quite the smokin' one).   3)  We give ourselves nicknames.  I used to believe it was for anonymity, but now I believe they are sort of lovey-dovey pet names for ourselves.  Chicken came from Vicente, though.   4)  We will review anything:  movies, restaurants, makeup, shoes, clothes, bars, shoes, makeup, perfume, shoes, makeup, makeup and makeup.   5)  We seem to start to know each other in a way that is intimate without being physically intimate.   6)  We "hug" and support each other in here.   7)  A lot of us end up with stalkers.  However, mine has been lurking silently lately and that pisses me off.   8)  We cuss a lot.  Don't read if the following words offend you:  fuck, fucking, shit, damn, slut, ho, motherfucker, muthafuckah, hell, goddamn and crap.   9)  Many of us are fascinated with shit.   10)  We seem to develop our own language and when we finally meet in person, we   blogtalk  , which has caused eavesdroppers to pause and stare.   11)  Most of us end up drunk posting or posting about being drunk.  There are a lot of drinkers in here.   12)  We're not shy, at least not in here.  Some of us aren't in "real life" (my hero, Jaden).   13)  We're obsessed with our stat counters.   14)  We use the word "blog" at least twice a day.  In actual conversation.  My friends cannot differentiate now between my friends that I actually visit and speak with, and the ones in here.   15)  Many of us have insomnia.   16)  The words "Donnie Darko" pop up a lot.   17)  I would bet that a whole lot of us blog in our underwear.    What more can  you  add?   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Okay, said I would post about my day earlier, then got caught up in aunt-related duties.   AEROPUERTO RUN   Woke up before five thinking I was way late to pick up Vicente for the airport run.  Turns out I was too early and ended up snoozing at V's for a while.   LATE AS USUAL   Running late due to later departure time, Bunny and I didn't meet up for coffee at the Nodding Dog until eleven.  We were joined by Monketo (a very nice guy) and after he had his coffee, we went to La Calle Doce.  Mmmmm, fish tacos!  I didn't really care for the texture of Bunny's ceviche - it was not at all like what I expected.  I wasn't about to sample Monketo's lunch, as it was not on my list of things I can eat.  At one point, he asked me if he could ask me a question.  I replied, "Yes, I'm very high maintenance."  Monketo just looked at me and then said, "Uh, okay.  But I want to know what non-girlfriend means."  I just assumed he was asking the question I get more than anything else.  Except for "Why are you so sparkly at 10:30 in the morning?"

      Aieeeee!  Okay, what a night.  What a day.  Home prego test failed so I'm thinking the perpetual vomiting is simply nerves.  Why else would someone projectile you-know-what in the middle of the day?  After being called twenty times on their day off and having someone slam into their car (not my car, my brother's) while their niece was in the back seat???  Luby's - that's where she wanted to go.  Not Pappadeaux, and you know why?  Because "Momma hasn't been there yet, and she really wants to go."  What a sweet child.  Then we played Dogopoly until she became bored and started tossing the money into the air.  We watched Caddyshack.  She played on barbie.com and drew me pictures.  I had a cocktail and we went to bed.  Bad Aunt Chicken.  TIRED Aunt Chicken is more like it.  It's those four years I worked in that day care center.  Children wear me out.  They are almost as high maintenance as I am.  Ah, the young one is awake.  I'll be toast in the a.m. for keeping her up.  "This is the best day of my life."  That's what she told me at least five times.  No, honey, except for the accident and the throwing up, it's one of the best days of my life.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      At least, not tonight.  But maybe at 3:12 a.m. on Friday, as it seems to be my habit lately.  I forgot to buy dog treats again.  Well, I didn't really forget, I just wanted to come home, light a candle for the Sparkster and get plastered.   I DON'T HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW   Thank God, as I am sick of it.  Oh, to be independently wealthy.  Then I could be a classy slut like Paris Hilton.   whatever   Aeropuerto run early in the a.m., then off to cafe and fabu pastry delights with Bun.  I'm bringing Buzzy.  He's the only one of the three I can scold into submission.  All he wants to do is  lick your legs  anyway.   "HI, MY NAME IS CHICKEN, AND I'M AN..."   Like you really thought I'd finish  that  sentence.   I AM WAITING FOR THE LAUNDRY FAIRY, AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF CLEAN UNDERWEAR   I'm so terribly lazy that I might go and buy new ones to prolong the time I can wait in between washes.   I'm a clean person.   I just don't believe in  domestic duties .  That's for someone else, someone I pay $75 so my house is clean.  I WOULD GET MARRIED AGAIN IF I COULD HAVE A CLEAN HOUSE EVERY DAY.  Well, no, I wouldn't.  But sometimes I am  tempted .  Remember "Rock and Roll High School"?  If you don't, you're too fucking young and you need to go to another blog.  One that reminisces fondly about the  New Kids On The Block .  "I hate mousework."   THERE ARE THREE FUCKING CHICKENS NEXT DOOR   This ain't Utah, my fair-feathered friends.  That cock is really getting some action.  I'm fonder of the smaller, more colorful fowl.  Or perhaps it is two roosters and a hen?  LIVE:  CHICKEN PORN - HOT! HOT! HOT!  God, I think this is retribution for living in the suburbs.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       This post is dedicated to  Sparky    It has been  one hell of a long year .  I had to work at home last Fathers' Day while my poor little man was in the hospital, recovering from a blood transfusion.  Had I known that I would never bring him home again (alive), I'd have taken off the next day and not have done that fucking transport when I could have had at least one more visitation with him.  The day after he died, I cried so hard I started throwing up.  I remember the evening of his death, sitting on my den floor, doing one shot of vodka after another while my mom kept telling me that this wasn't the way to handle it.  The very next weekend I went out and got my  Sparky tattoo .  It took my mom an entire month to send me a sympathy card.  She kept trying to write in it but couldn't, as every time she was overtaken by tears.  I cried every time I read the cards I received, so I finally put them away in my memory box for the  little fat guy .  Paddy liked to call him "Tubbs."  I once threw a complete stranger out of my house (well, bitched at him until he left) because he made a cruel remark about Sparky's weight.  Sparky would come running when I'd say, "My little man" or "scratchy?"  And he couldn't help it that he was fat.   He ignored me when I called him by his real name.   People didn't know how to handle me there for a while.  I had one potential buyer for a property we owned who made a snide remark about "being upset about a dead dog" and I came this close to chewing his weasely little snarky ass out.  But I needed my job.  I still hate that motherfucker with a  passion .  Sparky's eulogy got forwarded to people across the country, people I didn't even know.  There are so many people out there who understood what I was going through.  And some who didn't.  Those who didn't, I'd swerve to miss a squirrel if they were both in my path.  And I don't really like squirrels all that much.  My makeup is running down my cheeks as I type.  Never a  truer love  have I known, not one so unconditional.  Sparky always knew when I was upset.  Even now, all three dogs I have don't become nearly as upset as my Sparky did when momma was crying.  He tried my patience.  He made me cuss up a blue streak.  I would spend 100 times over what I spent to keep him alive - all VERY MUCH WORTH IT.  He annoyed the hell out of Mark Pittman.  Paddy loved him almost as much as I did.  He was my fucking savior.  And I was his for a very short time.  A piece of my heart and soul was taken from me at 2:25 p.m. on June 17, 2003.  Those of you who cannot understand this can FUCK OFF.  Those of you who do,   I love you  .   God bless My Little Man.   How very much I loved him.  Sparky December 1, 1999 - June 17, 2003  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I absolutely HATE being left alone in this office.  It creeps me out.  Some went to meetings, others to properties, and my assistant went to Farmers' Market with her mom to buy some fruit.  Okay.  The noisy-ass fax machine sounds like someone is trying to break in.  I cannot concentrate.  And I think my office phone is being bugged.  I don't care, I'll still be calling my bookie, my crack dealer and that escort service anyway.   I'M BORED   It took too long at the nail salon between my fingers and toes that I had to stop them mid-pedicure and leave without polish.  At least my feet are soft and smooth.  And very, very slippery.  I walked into Taco Cabana afterwards for (guess what) bean and cheese tacos and appeared as though I was staggering into the place in a drunken fashion.  I wish.   MORE ON THE LOTTERY   One hundred and twenty million dollars.  And Timmy, those aren't my friends, they're my co-workers.  I'm with Vicente - I like to work as little as possible unless it's something I'm passionate about.  nongirlfriend - that's not work.  This blog - it's fun and a release.  My love life?  Well, sometimes it is, but usually on his part.  I'm a lot of fun to put up with sometimes.   IT  IS  WORK-RELATED   I have to send a certified letter out this afternoon.  Might as well go to the Main U.S. Postal Office, right down the street from Siegel's on Industrial.  I'm taking orders...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I'm such a good nongirlfriend.  I wake up at 4:55 to wake Vicente's ass up in New York.  Now I cannot go back to sleep.  My parents are leaving today for my uncle's funeral.  If I hadn't been sick, I would have left early tomorrow to go.  It's just too damned far away.  Plus, then I'd have to see my aunt and her bitchy, weird daughters, and I just don't want that misery.  She's the one who, after having a masectomy, decides I really need to see the scar.  After much pleading to the opposite on my part.  I think living in the country too long affects people in a slightly adverse manner.   ARE YOU A WORKAHOLIC?   Nope?  Me neither.  In fact, we were all having lunch at work the other day and talk of winning the lottery came up.  Everyone said they would still keep working.   FUCK THAT SHIT.   I'd shop and travel and do whatever I wanted to, which (in the tradition of Peter Gibbons) would be NOTHING.  I would also have the  world's largest dressing room .  Look out, Imelda Marcos.  They would keep working?  Please.  I would do some sort of volunteer work, or have my own rescue shelter.  But work for someone else?  I don't think so.  I'd probably also get a few more Min Pins.  I'd really like to have a whole herd.   FUCK IT, I'M GOING BACK TO BED   Who the hell gets up at 5:00 in the morning???  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Try pulling off an entire set of acrylic nails with your  teeth .  Believe me, if I could grow my own nails, I wouldn't put up with such bullshit.  But Vicente likes the feeling of fingernails on his back, and the babies love getting their "scratchy" so I keep it up.   OKAY, I'M BORED. AND INSOMNIATIC.   At least I'm not fucking  shopping .   I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO TO WORK TOMORROW.  I REALLY DON'T WANT TO WORK EVER AGAIN.   Still, I have not found the answer to my dilemma.  My ears hurt.  My eyes are watering.  However, if I want to still take Friday off to spend with my niece, I must go in.  There had better be bean and cheese tacos waiting for me, goddamnit.   MIN PINS IN EVERY ROOM   Apparently, the grass had a  relaxing effect  on Sado's tum (I've heard it's  helpful  that way).  She's now sleeping with Buzzy, and Nico is crashed out in the den.  And Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn (geez, one would hope my childhood wouldn't follow me around this way)   I SWEAR TO GOD, I REALLY  DO  HAVE A LIFE   I'm just addicted to this shit.  And have trouble sleeping.  Not always the best combination.  Hey, but it works for me.   ONE OF MY NAILS COMMITTED SUICIDE   There ain't no way that baby is gonna be ready for powder and fumes and too much acetone.   GOING TO BED   Otherwise, we'll have a mass suicide on our hands from sheer and simple BOREDOM.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       blogtree.com  - an interesting idea for your blog - tracing its genealogy.  I have two sibling blogs, one of whom I do not know.   NOT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BUT   I finally stopped throwing up.  And I was able to eat old-people-food and keep it down.   ANONYMITY   It is funny that some people remain anonymous and visit so often.  I was speaking with  urlLink Bunny  earlier this evening, and that subject came up.  Seems  urlLink Zero  had an anonymous commenter the other day.   And then there's  Nein .    THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS' BLOG   They would probably wash out your mouths with soap if they knew you were reading it.   IT IS ALL BUNNY'S FAULT    urlLink This  is why I could not take a nap and try to rid myself of this horrible cold.  So now I've yet another ecommerce site to go blow my $$$ (what little is left after bills, etc.).  I told Bun that her email with that link was like sending an alcoholic on a beer run.  Oh fuck.  You know I'll end up buying it.  Oh, and if anybody is in the market for  buying me things , I'd like one of  urlLink these  in every color.  However, one will suffice.  I was looking for a pink purse -  urlLink found one .   LOOK WHAT THE CHICKEN DRUG IN   Okay, folks, I was pretty well-behaved and only bought mascara at Sephora.  My Bad Gal Lash is drying up (that sucker lasts a long time, though), so I thought I would try Urban Decay's Skyscraper Mascara in the only available color - Gotham.  What I love about the online thing is that I always get my choice of three samples.  Which is how I end up spending way too much money the next time I visit.  Plus, there's that  little black velvet gift bag  they come in.  I think I have eight or nine by now.   SOMETHING'S FOWL ABOUT THAT   For the record, today was not a hangover.  I'm getting the feeling that most people thought it was.  Believe me, I'd  prefer  a hangover.  Actually, I don't really get them anymore.  Too much practice, I'm sure.  Paddy Mac told me I wasn't sick.  We just won't go into that.  Next time, I will save all the vomit and the sweaty clothes and dump them in his room.  Hangovers don't cause your lymph glands to swell up over night.  Besides that, I wasn't even drinking.  Not Sunday night at least.  Bunny's mom shares my affinity for vodka.  You gotta love her.   SICK AS A DOG   Poor Sadie has a stomach ache and proceeded to graze my lawn like a goat.  She still wants to go outside.  How much grass is too much for a dog to eat?  And why the hell do they eat grass when they're sick?  I would think grass would only serve to make me sicker, but then again,  Chickens eat  rocks  .

       Just when you thought the fun was over...   I had to go to Seven-Eleven to pick up some more coke.  And some ice, since my ice maker hasn't worked in three years and I'm just too goddamned lazy (and ignorant) to repair it.  It's freaking HOT out there.  Then I pull up, haul my purchases out of Ol' Red, and this fucking wasp (not like Pisser's WASPs) wouldn't let me in the house.  My neighbors now have physical evidence of my insanity.   NEEDLESS TO SAY, BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT ANYWAY   All that running around the front yard, swatting at the little bastard and my dogs are barking incessantly inside, watching their psychotic mama do the Frantic Chicken Dance, I come inside and immediately lose the food I managed to keep down for 90 minutes.   TO THE READER WHO ORDERED A SHIRT THIS WEEKEND:   Thanks, and of course, I didn't get to the UPS place because I was so busy vomiting.  It will set sail off to you tomorrow.   BUNNY IS THE DEVIL   Thanks, no  REALLY ,  thanks!!  for sending me that email about that $58 knit top at Anthropologie.  Do you know how long I spent on that website (in between vomit visits, of course)?  Speaking of the v word...excuse me, please.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Why did mashed potatoes with brown gravy seem even the least bit appetizing?  Went in to work, grabbed some shit to work on at home, barely made it back before projectile vomiting those lovely fake mashed potatoes.  I think macaroni and cheese might be a better plan the next time I attempt to eat.   RUBBER DUCKY, YOU'RE THE ONE   So now I am going to take a bath.  Splish splash.   VICENTE INVADES NEW YORK   Good thing I didn't buy those tickets.  Puking on a plane can not be a pleasant activity.   LOOKS LIKE I WON'T BE TAKING THURSDAY OFF   Why do I always feel guilty when I am sick?  It seems since that abscessed tooth last year, I've been sick on a regular basis.  I do believe the infection entered my brain.  Cripey!  I believe the taters are swimming upstream again.   More on vomiting later...   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      This post is completely dedicated to  Pisser , who thinks dogs stink.  They   do  .  They also bark too much.  I don't need an alarm system at my house - Sadie is enough alarm for most anything.  Dogs  eat their own vomit and shit , but still their mouths are cleaner than ours?  (Remind me never to kiss anyone again, k?)  It's been proved (wait, is that an actual word?) that dogs lower humans' capacity for depression.  If so,  why the fuck am I on Prozac if I have three freakin' dogs ???  Pisser, all I can say is  CHEESE .  Or cheese pizza.  My babies are the best.  Right now, Rainman (Buzzy) is growling at me for some cheese pizza.  Nico prances around the backyard in true Min Pin fashion.  And Sadie, that Snarky Bitch, doesn't listen to a goddamned thing I say.   P  - stick with felines.  They're much easier to deal with.  I just like the  frustration .

      I had a friend named Dan once.  Drove himself into a telephone pole and died.  The phone call came as I had always expected it would.  There are just some people you know won't make it in this world.  I have eaten absolutely nothing today.  I hate the weekends - there is no structure and I need a schedule or a plan or something.  12:00 - EAT SOME FOOD  5:00 - EAT SOME MORE FOOD  It really isn't that difficult.   I DON'T DEAL WITH DEATH WELL   It's been almost a year since Sparky left me, and I still get upset.  Then my uncle goes and dies after being in some sort of coma (my mom said he was "skin and bones") and I really, really wish my dad didn't have to see him that way.  I don't know how I would handle my parents' deaths.  Not well is what I'm thinking.   NICKNAMES   Isn't it funny the names we give our "beloved" ones in here.  Vicente?  So far from his real name I might just puke.  Cranky?  I'm sure there's a story behind that name, right Pisser?  Who the fuck would want to be called a chicken?  That's  crazy .  I actually like being called chicken, but I'm strange.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      First, Erica's g-ma.  Then Linda's aunt.  Now my uncle.  At least he had a long life.  And he gave my mom another reason to bitch about me smoking (two emphysema deaths on that side of the family).  I told her I wanted to wear myself out before I was old, forgetful and living through a tube.  Wrong thing to say to her this morning.  But it's true.  I don't want to get old.  I'm already forgetful, so there's no desire to become wrinkly on top of it.   IN MEMORIAM   My dad will chastise me for not knowing, but I am pretty sure my uncle was a war hero.  I can't remember the story, but I know he was there.  My grandfather (dad's dad) was in the first World War.  Once, sitting on his bed at the nursing home, he thought I was another soldier, and told me of escaping captivity.  Eight years old is too young to deal with that.  Too bad I wasn't older...what a story I could have heard.   WE'RE LOSING A GENERATION VERY VALUABLE TO US   The  brats  of my generation and those who follow me are losing an  important part of our history , and  we're not even concerned .  You know what?  I LIKE hearing the old stories, I like hearing about school houses where you can find grades 1-12.  I don't buy the "walking to school in the snow" both ways bullshit, especially here in Texas, but I like it nonetheless.  I remember meeting an aunt about ten times removed who actually dipped chewing tobacco.  Te-backy, as they called it.   C-2 COCA COLA   The low-carb alternative.  Oh fuckitall, just drink the goddamned REAL THING and forget about it.  I swear, the Atkins craze is BULLSHIT.  I survive on carbs (among other things) and I weigh in at 120.  Besides, you don't know what they've done to your meat.   I wouldn't eat it if I were you .   ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER THEATRE IS IN THE OTHER ROOM   My older brother said that to me yesterday.  And he is ADD all the way.  We all are.  I'm easily distracted by shiny things or things that are pink.  I'm also easily seduced by makeup.  Gay men love me but they don't want to fuck me.   I'M WITH THELMA   Remember that in one of my favorite movies, Thelma and Louise, where Susan Sarandon asked Geena Davis if all she was gonna do is "stay drunk all day" - "Gonna try."  Her husband, Darryl, could have been my second ex.  Why do people think that's a lesbian film?  Because they kiss at the end?  Or because they eschew men?  THAT IS WHAT NONGIRLFRIEND IS ALL ABOUT.  I just don't get it.   BOYS ARE AN ACCESSORY   If I ever won an Academy Award, I'd thank the chickens next door.  At least they're "free-range."  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      For some reason, the tangent universe was not in sync last night, and Vicente left my house at 11:45 to  GO HOME .  I think he is on a  no-poultry diet  for a while.  This happens about every six months.  Or every time my head spins around and split pea soup comes flying out of my mouth.  Which  did NOT  happen last night.  I give up.  Men  cannot  be understood.  That's why I'm buying the  Chubby G  the very next opportunity I get.   POOR TIMING   Maybe he is just worried because he has so much to do to get ready for the next six weeks?  Maybe I'm this OCD bitch who cannot just let things lie and has to obsess over a fucking voice mail message?  (I think the latter  AND  the former apply here.)   FREE-RANGE CHICKENS   Pisser opened a can of  bean-eating worms  when she posted about United Poultry Concerns.  I've gone off my eggs-over-easy-with-wheat-toast (unless they are of the free-range variety, which I am almost certain Denny's doesn't carry) and I am having nightmares about molting chickens.  Perhaps I should don a nurse's uniform and shout out " Bok! " ala "The World According To Garp."   DRUNK DIALING   I received  TWO drunk dials  (count them, people, TWO) last night (this morning, whatever).  The fascinating part of this is that I almost always do the DD, but rarely receive it.  Mainly because most people know I'll be DD'ing them later, so they don't bother.  I also got called a  bitch  and a  see-you-next-Tuesday  (those were the  actual words ) for not picking up the phone.  Guys, my ringer's off.  I cannot hear the phone.  Specifically because I do not want to speak to people at two a.m.   No, not even  you .   I might be intoxicated.  However, last night, I was not so, unfortunately.  And the one voicemail I got that was not under the influence didn't use  chicken terminology .  So now I am sad.   BITTER WITH BAGGAGE SEEKS SAME   I have  CHEESE  on my t-shirt.  Last night, I actually ate cheddar-cheese-stuffed-jalapenos.  And I  hate  jalapenos.   Or so I thought .  Why did the chicken  eat  the mountain?   Because it was THERE.   This skinny bitch really can be a PIG sometimes.   IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME...   I would find a way to be 18 years old in physical appearance, 75 years old in wisdom and 100 years old in eccentricity.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      After reading about  urlLink Leif Wright's post  on his and Soko's trip to Austin, I became nostalgic for the days Paddy Mac lived there, both during college and when he moved back afterwards.   And not just because of the pot.   I remember the evenings at Little Mexico, eating myself silly (probably because I was so fucked up, it never took too long).  And Jason, sitting on the couch, singing along to "You Sexy Motherfucker."  (Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)  Or watching "Zulu" for the 129th time.  PM's was the place to be...I could smell the patchouli in the parking lot of his apartment.   SCAVENGER HUNT   I know I had some around here somewhere...   TOPIC DE JOUR   That insane guy who tossed his girlfriend off an overpass on Central Expressway - well, all I can say is that I hope he suffered and she died instantly.  It's like that fuckass who threw his puppy into traffic a few years back:  hell ain't hot enough for people like that.   BITCHES IN HEAT   Would anyone care to adopt  Mama Dog ?  She lives on property at one of our apartment communities.  We are still unsure if the  babies' daddy  is  Boy Toy , her former boyfriend, or  Blanco , the new guy on the scene.   Motherfuckers  at the City of Dallas pound won't come out to pick them up because they "are not aggressive" - they told us to tie up the dogs and they would come get them.  So we just started feeding them instead.  Hell, I'd take all three home if I could afford six vet bills (I can barely afford three and my addiction to sephora.com).  The dogs are so sweet, but no one can catch them.  MM actually felt the babies kicking when we found Mama Dog asleep under a car.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAITY!   My niece has a bday today.  She is still too young to truly appreciate the spankings.  Unlike her Aunt Chicken.   CRAP   Well, folks, it's been too long since I've posted about shit (feces, "baby mice," whatever).  Due to my insomnia, I woke up in the middle of the night and watched "Donnie Darko" AGAIN.  Hey, at least it kept me from buying that Dior moisturizer and "Higher Energy" perfume I've been eyeing.   BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHIT?   Sorry, Jake Gyllenhaal distracted me for a moment.  And then there's  urlLink  makeup  .  I think the lack of bean and cheese tacos in my diet has proven to render me a little "backed up," as Kramer would say.  Then again, not eating all fucking day doesn't help, either.  Or, as  urlLink Pisser  would say,  CHEESE .  [Do not worry, this is not another eating disorder - let's call it a  sleeping disorder , as in I slept all day and forgot to eat until my empty belly gave me the Headache From Hell.]   STALK ME   I really don't have to ask, but Nein won't comment anymore even though I know he/she/it is still out there.  Yesterday, someone from Iraq visited me.  Well, visited Non-Girlfriend but you know what I mean.  I'm sure they enjoyed my  feistiness .  Chicken becomes Iraq's Public Enemy Number Two (there's still Bush).   Osama Bin Laden is one fugly motherfucker.   It's no wonder he's  hiding in caves .   THE DOGS BEGIN TO SMELL HER   The dingos are pestering me to go out in the backyard.  I actually believe they are  POUTING .  Time to go.  Maybe you'll all luck out and I'll do a drunk blog later on.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       Has anyone seen my fee-an-say?  The poor baby.   To answer Vicente's questions, No, I do not want to go out tonight.  I want to be as lazy as humanly possible and watch Saturday Night Live in my underwear.  And order another fucking cheese pizza.  Like all the pizza I had last night wasn't enough.  Ar!  Hey,  don't mess with Texas !  Keep yer butts in the car!  (Mary/Lisa will appreciate that reference, tree-hugger that she is.  She will also hunt you down if you litter, so watch out for a white Mazda whatever-the-hell-it's-called.  Oh wait, it's a Tribute.  Thanks Dalty!)  I've seen that bitch  chase people down  who throw things out of their cars.  Vicente is fed up with the Chicken.  I have no idea why, because I'm one of the most  charming  people you will ever meet.  It can't be the fact that I am lazier than just about anyone living. Or that I hate housework. Or that I'm terrible with money. Or that I drank all that vodka last night. Or that I chain-smoke at times.  No, it couldn't be any of those reasons at all.  Actually, I think he just needed a reason to get off the phone.  Like, "Let me let you go, I'm busy" wasn't available.  Men.  What more can I say?  Except that I feel like puking because I haven't eaten all day, and that seems to be counter-intuitive, you know, to puke up nothing?  Maybe it's just the Red Bull.   THAT'S ENTER TAIN MENT!   Apparently, one can throw up nothing.  And throw it up through their nose.  How exciting.   EVERYTHING'S BETTER WITH BLUEBONNET ON IT   Except pickles.  Or ice cream.  Or watermelon.  Or maybe Chelsea Clinton.   BLAH BLAH  BLAH    I really have nothing to say today, as is evident by 99% of this post.  So I'm going to go soak my head and watch some trashy television.   Cheers to all!   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       I need a cigarette.   It's sunny outside for once in DAYS and I'm trapped inside this windowless office.  ...obviously, I didn't need one too badly.  It's too fucking humid outside to  puff .  I took three of my pseudo-drags (I don't inhale) and threw the fucker away.   Can you tell I'm about to get my period?    ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ   I'm spending my afternoon the  very best way  I think anyone can:  writing escrow adjustment letters to our lenders.  Whee.  Whoo.   ARGH!   I'm literally so bored that I was counting the number of air conditioner vents in the office.  And picking at my fingernails.    Eew  , never, ever look down at your feet when you haven't had a pedicure in a while.  Wouldn't it be great if we could get PAID (paid, not  laid , you pervs!) to sit around and blog all day long?  I'd be a goddamned millionaire by now.  (If you went on the number of posts, including deleted  drunk posts .)   PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT   Don't get pissed off at a co-worker and email them from home when you are upset.  Things usually don't turn out right when you do.   AND NOW, BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAM...   Actually, I haven't posted anything lengthy at work in a while.  My work area (cell) is starting to get more personalized.  On my cabinet door of my computer hutch, I have a photo of a grinning dog sitting in a shopping cart, a homemade thank you note from Mary/Lisa and an It's Happy Bunny sticker (the "cute but psycho" one).  Down below that is my shrine of protection from the evil forces lurking about:  my mini Buddha (facing east), my Tarte candle ("Battery Park" - smells like childhood to me) and my Devil Min Pin.

      The whole point of having a "journal" is to be able to vent.  However, one of my co-workers in San Antonio has this link so not so good an idea at times.  It felt good to get that off my chest.  And I didn't even have to drive a rusty nail through my hand.  Thank God, since I don't think my tetanus shots are up to date.  Paddy Mac wanted to see Sadie at 2:30 in the morning.  Great, so now I'm up.  And the babies think it's time to eat.  Buzzy's so conditioned that if an alarm goes off at say 3:00 in the afternoon, by God, it is TIME TO EAT.  Junebugg, I have no idea what happened to oral sex.  I was drunk.  Maybe I was wanting some?  I really cannot say.  I just wanted to lie down and go to sleep, and wake up with a different job.  Ah, if it were only that easy.  I think three years is enough.  I never used to have all these sleep issues (or drink issues, for what that's worth) or anger issues.  I used to be a Happy Camper (even though I don't care for camping, really).  I guess I ought to go back to bed.  I'm up with the chickens next door and in to work at 7:30 again.  Hey, at least it's fucking Friday.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

A few minutes here, a few minutes there.  I even beat my boss in.  At least there was a sushi buffet with Vicente.  Six and a half  LONG ASS DAYS  until I'm off for the Sparky Weekend.  Shit. Fuck.

      I'm fucking sick of the rain.  I'm also sick of laundry but if I wanna wear panties tomorrow, I guess I better do some.  I'm sick of politics (not the Presidential election, the work variety).  But I'm kinda sick of the Presidential election, too.  I'm sick of anti-smokers (shut UP already, I know it will kill me).  I'm not sick of vodka, but I'm beginning to care more for a margarita.  No salt, please.   YES, BUNNY, 'TIS TRUE   My blogging-during-the-day days are over.  It's not like I spent HOURS on the damned thing anyway.  Besides, I'm trapped at a fucking desk all day long so I need some entertainment and a break from Excel.   BOK. BAK. WHO  CARES ?   Apparently Gregg does.  Please go check out his hilarious website,  urlLink sexwithchickens.com .  I am so gonna buy the babies t-shirts from his website.  I think Crotch Dog (Nico) will look stunning in one as he   shits on my floor again  !  I'm also going to MikWright to buy some more cocktail napkins.  One can never have too many, at least not around this place.   CHICKEN REALITY TV   Thank God the webcam RDM gave me did not work with my computer.  I'm pretty scary right now - eye makeup on my left eye is smeared across my face (I forgot about it when I rubbed my eye).  I also have BAD HAIR.  It just won't work with me when it's raining.  And we're looking at another WEEK of Bad Hair Days.   ONE WEEK TO GO   I took next Thursday and Friday off for the Sparky Anniversary, and to just chill for a few days.  I thought I might go somewhere but I really want to spend time with the babies.  Mary/Lisa said, "Oh SURE...you'll just blog all day long."  No, I will not.  I may have a few cocktails and watch "Donnie Darko" again, too.   IF I AM UNEMPLOYED TOMORROW, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HIRE ME?   I'm cute, I'm fun, and I really don't like to work all that much.  Email me for a resume.  Your company won't be the same afterwards.   CLUCK-N-FUCK    I'm telling you , go see the chickens having sex.  YOU won't be the same afterwards.   CANDY IS DANDY BUT LIQUOR IS QUICKER   Ask Aunt Chicken.  Just don't ask her about last weekend.   Whew .   MISCELLANY    *  I want a day of mourning for my death.  I also want a shrine built in honor of me, but like a Buddhist shrine, only a Platinum Chicken - please, no ghetto gold for me!   *  When the director's cut of "Donnie Darko" comes out, who's going with me?  (Bunny, you know you have no other choice!)   *  Since February 22, 2004, I have seen "Donnie Darko" at least 28 times.  And YES, I have heard of OCD.   *  I used to let Sparky pick out CDs for my parties.  He should have been a DJ.  One night, he pulled out nothing but heroin-overdose-groups and we had a blast!   *  My uncle is dying.  And I really do not know what the fuck to say to my father.   *  Vicente is the nicest.  And has the cutest butt.  I'm going to miss him this summer.   *  I'm going to Cozumel this summer.  But I won't drink the water.  Why bother when the booze is  free ?  I may be dumb but I am NOT stupid.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       The Day From  Hell    ( don't even ask )  Nuthin' but rain, rain,  RAIN  in North Central Texas.  Half of my backyard has washed away.  I cannot make up my mind about what to eat for dinner so of course I'll go to bed without eating.  Like most nights.  I just simply cannot be  bothered .   DON'T FORGET THE  CHEESE    Sorry, but I just wanted  cheese  in this post.   TRYING TO TAKE VACATION   Little Man's anniversary is next Thursday.  Still haven't heard if I can take off that day (and the following).  So I am just assuming I don't have to go in.  Hey Bloggers -  Cozumel  in August!   Crispy Fried Chicken  available in September.   EVENTUALLY, SOMEDAY, I'D LIKE TO OWN A HORSE FARM   No, not really.  But doesn't it sound  cool ?  Mea culpa for the sporadic, all-over-the-place, ADD-blogging.  Had a VERY BAD DAY and I just wanna  NOT THINK .  (As a student of English and Literature, I really think I could have worded that sentence differently.)   Bun-Bun , email me - I'll give you the "beauty blog" info.   AND NOW, FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...   Can you  sue  someone for turning you into an   alcoholic  ???  I'm just wondering.   NG BETTER TAKE OFF - THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY   Well, that's not really ALL, but it's a start.   Can I leave you with a list of things I (ahem) "dislike" (hate)?   1) Idiots  2) Ignorant people  3) People who throw their WEIGHT around  4) Pedicurists who think they know better than you do  5) Ditto with hairdressers  6) Cold coffee (that is  not  supposed to be cold)  7) Nepotism  8) Liars  9) Tail-gaters  10) Gossipers (only in the bad sense of it, not when it's good news)  11) Idiots ( oh, wait, I said that already )  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      (courtesy of  urlLink MikWright )  Yep, it  is  a Monday, and not just at work.  I come home to check orders and my goddamned Outlook isn't working.  After I found out my mom had to take her dog (my former dog, Buffy) to the vet.  Suspiciously absent from dinner when I stopped by to mooch some "home cooking" off my parents, I learned of the malady and drove up to the vet, only to have missed her by about a minute.  At least Buff's in no grave danger.  They found her staring at the toilet and acting scared.  I think she was staring at the toilet because she had to shit, and couldn't because her pancreatitis is acting up.  On to more pleasant subjects...   CHEESE   Yes, cheese.  The reason I cannot shit like a normal person.  Cheese.  My most favorite food.  Cheese.  A reason for living.  Cheese, cheese, cheese-cheese-CHEESE.  A good time to sigh is after saying "cheese," or eating some cheese, or even  thinking  about cheese.  Now   there   you have some appropriate times to sigh.  I've often wondered why no one has ever made cheese-flavored bubble gum.  Where's Willy Wonka when you need him?   MIND-BLOWING SEX!   Why yes,  thank you !   LET'S JUST SUFFICE IT TO SAY I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE EMPANADA   Vicente likes saying the word, though.  I'm just not all about that much dough, you know?  Even so, the Vegetarian Brazilian Breakfast was good; just hold the empanada and gimme some of them black beans, would ya?  I prefer saying "chimichanga."  Chimichanga, chimichanga - what the fuck is a chimichanga?  It's fried, so I've never tried one.  Isn't it like some big-ass burrito all deep-fried and fattening?  Do they make a CHEESE chimichanga?  I just might change my mind.   WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SALLY STRUTHERS?   I wonder what kind of Google searches  that  one will bring up?   LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA   Or in our case, in the time of AIDS, genital herpes, syphilis, chlymadia and that old favorite, gonorrhea.  Since I have been "ensconced" for almost four years, I forget sometimes how honestly frightening it would be to be dating again.  Condoms.  Hosing one's partner down with Lysol.  Taking blood samples prior to agreeing to meet for coffee.  Scary times.  Damn the government, whichever side you might be for.  I really think this shit could have been at least  controlled  by now.  Or maybe I've just been watching far too much HBO?   I GIVE UP.  I'M JUST GONNA GO TO BED.   I really need to make up for the lack of sleep from this weekend.  Still... Eric Clapton ?  I wouldn't have missed it for the world!  (By the way, Vicente is all about learning the blues now.  Seems like I might come in handy for that, don't you think?)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       FABULOUS  day at the  Crossroads Guitar Festival .  Until driving home this morning (out late again!), I didn't realize how truly lucky we were to get to attend this.  Yes, Vicente, this does put you in   THE  Nicest  Category.  My Absolut favorite part was the blues jam session with EC, B.B. King, Jimmie Vaughn (who is  way cute  in a Boz Scaggs sort of way), Buddy Guy and John Mayer.  I cannot wait for the DVD release.  When it comes on PBS, be sure to watch it.   SHAMELESS WHORING   Fox 4 News was there, of course, but the guy was filming a plastic cup full of beer.  I happened to be buying WATER but some drunk guy said, "Chug that down!  Chug that down in one shot and he'll film you for TV!"  I won't end up on the news, I'm certain, but what the hell?  There's a minute possibility I could get some free advertising.  Having gorgeous Veronica walk around in a ng shirt was good advertising in and of itself.  I heard many guys say they liked my shirt as I walked by (tits out, chin up), and a group even   catcalled   me, saying, "nongirlfriend! nongirlfriend! over here!"  I really don't think that I would ever have a problem with fame.   EATING ISSUES   They ran out of food after waiting in line for 45 minutes at The Old (Grist) Mill at Fair Park.  Of course, I'm ultra high maintenance and could not just grab a burger like everyone else (eew).  So we ventured out across the street and found the most fabulous little bar that served food (one where they still let you smoke, as most of their revenue comes from the booze, babies).  Started off with the jalapeno hummus and baked pita wedges.  Not quite as good as Mercy's black bean/roasted red pepper hummus but  quite tasty .  It was Veronica's virgin tasting and she loved it!  We also shared a  CHEESE  and fruit platter (goat cheese, sharp cheddar and dill havarti).  I dipped my  CHEESE  into the hummus and tried to forgo too much of the three breads presented.  I finished my dining experience with a crab cake and freshly steamed green beans.  (There were two crab cakes but due to the  CHEESE  and hummus consumption   extravaganza  , I could only eat one, unfortunately.  Very first crab cakes I've ever eaten that didn't give me indigestion.   AND  we were drinking some  strong-ass margaritas .)  Go to the Meridian Bar and Restaurant on Parry Avenue right across from Fair Park.  Good food, good service and YOU CAN SMOKE!  Two P.S. type thingies:  Check out their three cheese sandwich (have it on a wheat bun) and their bread pudding.  The bread pudding alone would successfully feed a third world nation in its entirety for at least two days.   QUEEN GEE-TAR   Vicente has found the guitar he wants to bid on at the Christie's auction Eric Clapton set up, proceeds benefitting the Crossroads rehab place he set up in Antigua.  I tell you what, when I finally decide to check myself in (or should I say, IF), I'm drying out there.  Okay, is it just me, or do you catch the irony in EC singing "Cocaine" at a benefit concert for drying-out-places???  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       I dedicate my 400th post to you!   Checking my Chicken Email for hate mail (I'm twisted that way), I find that Elizabeth Major wants to know if I want a bigger penis.  Well, Lizzie, nope, V's is perfect, but thank you  so very much  for asking.  In honor of one of my most  endearing  qualities, Vicente gives you this:   The Procrastinator's Creed   I believe that if anything is worth doing, it would have been done already.   I shall never move quickly, except to avoid more work or find excuses.   I will never rush into a job without a lifetime of consideration.   I shall meet all of my deadlines directly in proportion to the amount of bodily injury I could expect to receive from missing them.   I firmly believe that tomorrow holds the possibility for new technologies, astounding discoveries, and a reprieve from my obligations.   I truly believe that all deadlines are unreasonable regardless of the amount of time given.   If at first I don't succeed, there is always next year.   I shall always decide not to decide, unless of course I decide to change my mind.   I shall always begin, start, initiate, take the first step, and/or write the first word, when I get around to it.   I will never put off tomorrow, what I can forget about forever.   (author unknown)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       The  Cows' Ball  (Kravji Bal) in Bohinj is a kitschy weekend of eating, drinking and folk dancing in mid-September to mark the return of the cows to the valleys from their high pastures. It doesn't get any more  Slovenian  than this.   I wonder if they have any Chicken Festivals?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       Not me.   Although I am sure someone, somewhere did.  And they are probably regretting it right as I type this.   Or maybe not .   TOMORROW MAY AS WELL BE FRIDAY AGAIN   I have to work.  Then Mary/Lisa and I are going to get our  hairs  cut together.  Then (she doesn't know this yet), we are going  Power Window Shopping .  Vicente laughed about my "orders" to frequent the malls and shops - he said it was like someone ordering him to  have sex .   Vicente is a virile man.   Thank God I cannot get pregnant.  (Can you really imagine a little Chicken running around?  Isn't one enough?)  The wonderful website my nonboyfriend, Vicente, so lovingly created, was slammed by someone (I love the stat counters, they're  so much fun ).  Well, well, not one to spar with just about anybody, I decided to link her over there on the right side.  But for now, go check out  urlLink Leigh .  And while you are at it,  BUY HER AN SUV FOR HER BIRTHDAY .  Do NOT criticize Vicente.  That is   MY   job.  To answer your unspoken question,   No , I did not  ever  take criticism well .  We  Pisceans  are way too sensitive for  that .   TOSHIO'S FOR LUNCH   Why does sushi always leave me  wanting more  about 45 minutes later?  Oooh, SG, I see I have a visitor from  urlLink Slovenia .  That seems to be the place I need to be.  I love the Mediterranean.  Or at least its food, since I have never, ever been.  SG, I was only sparring.  I feel I may have overstepped my boundaries.  God, this cheese pizza fetish simply  MUST END .  Someone at work today told me I was   shrinking  .  Not always a bad thing.  Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs, this is stream-of-consciousness blogging.  What the fuck does it matter to you?  God, this week sucked.  Let's hope love and warmth and happiness and JOYJOYJOY and an eventful shopping trip grace me this weekend, or I might have to visit  Sephora  again.

      My neighbors' wooden fence is collapsing into my backyard.  They have a chicken, a rooster and about 3,000 pigeons.  I walked next door to "let them know," expecting a feud and civil trials, etc., but Yara was very nice.  Her husband "loves birds" and I shared my nickname with her.   Anyone who loves chickens has my vote.   Funny thing is, I've never talked to her before.  And last weekend marked my fourth anniversary in this house.   They probably think I'm a prostitute .  (There certainly are a lot of men-folk in and out of my house, but I promise, I'm only have sex with  one  of them, the most amazing and fun  Vicente !).   Fabulous Fluffy Bunny  sent me a link to a USA Today article about people-who-watch-Donnie-Darko-over-and-over.  I have the columnist beat:  I've seen it 20 times more than she has.  And seven is an awful lot of times to view one movie.  I simply MUST get my hair cut this weekend:  I'm braiding it again.  Ugh.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Switching to soy milk  as soon as possible .  That was the second chai tea latte over ice that I threw up today.  And I vomited milk this weekend.  Home early because I had a   fabulous   meeting with  RG , whom Vicente met on a plane.  Great information -  really  nice guy (his designer was very kind and helpful, too) - lots of good advice.  We'll just see what happens.  I really, seriously have my work cut out for me.  I was given an assignment I just don't think I can handle, though.  You mean I have to constantly be at the malls and shops, checking things out?  Nope, no way.  You know how very much I   detest   shopping.  It's one of the worst ways one can spend their time.  Oops, that's what my mother and father brainwashed into my head.  Obviously, it did not stick.  I have much to do so short post.  However, I will be back (like you doubted that), most likely in the middle of the night.   ** By the way, I will be out in LA in July, just in case any one of you LA-Bloggers want to buy me a  drink  **   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       VERY  early to rise.  At least I got a lot of sleep.  And had a few strange dreams about co-workers.  ( clears throat )  I won't go into that.  I've been up for an hour, since 5 a.m., which is unusual for me (I typically go back to bed and then oversleep).  I had to stay up this morning...airport run for work and business plan I didn't finish last night.  PRELIM business plan, as my education was in English and Literature, and Vicente does that stuff better than I do, anyway.  Let us put his MBA to work so I can do what I do best:   be creative and  procrastinate  .  Kudos to  urlLink Pushing In The Pin  for ordering some ng-wear.  Yes, folks, this is yet one more attempt to  blatantly whore myself  for my company.  I suppose Bunny won't be surprised if one of her bday gifts is a  t-shirt ...  Oops!  Spilled the beans!  I've never been one known to keep a harmless secret.  The important stuff, I conveniently "forget."  Can I be any more addictive than I am already?  Blogging, cigarettes, vodka, Sugar Free Red Bull, and now - ( drumroll, please )  Chai Tea Latte On Ice .  It is a most   splendiferous   drink.  I could swim in the stuff.  Well, Paddy's been in the shower since before I started this post, and it is now 6:07 a.m.  I have to leave in 90 minutes and if I want to go to work looking bee-you-tuh-full, I need to get kicking.  Oh, hell, I roll out of bed looking gorgeous, what am I worried about?  (The fact that I am delusional and just wrote that last sentence would be a start.)  I want  Food Babies  to come back in popularity.  No matter what I do, what I try or what I eat (or don't eat), mine just won't disappear.  Okay, maybe for a day, then I drink a Diet Coke and the salt just brings the damn thing back to life.  Pisser likes the smallish belly that the Food Baby provides.  Here,  urlLink Pisser , you can have mine.  Just don't get too attached to the brat, it always seems to find its way back home.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I get a hell of a lot of my titles from things  Vicente  says to me.  And from  Donnie Darko  and  Seinfeld .  I only quote the best, babies.  Last night, V went out with vendors and   misbehaved  .  This morning, I call him and he is suffering from a hangover headache.  "Drink some Coke,  real  Coke.  The sugar and caffeine will help."  "Drink some ice water, too.  Take aspirin or ibuprofen."  Vicente deadpans, "  Tips from Chicken  ."  How  sad  is it that I'm handing out anti-hangover tips and cures for the morning after?  Maybe I should take my show on the road?  College campuses everywhere could benefit.  Hell,  junior high schools  these days could benefit.   EXCITING DAY TOMORROW!   I get to meet with someone about  urlLink  nongirlfriend  .  I feel like throwing up from nervousness but I'll be fine.  Besides, when do I ever NOT feel like throwing up?  I just won't eat lunch tomorrow so I won't vomit on the guy.  That might make for an awkward meeting.  This post is dedicated to  urlLink Ninsi , who applauds my multiple-postings, and to  urlLink Bunny , who gets after me when I only post once a day.  Big,   wet  , MAC Lipglass kiss to you both.  Currently, I am wearing Lovechild.  A girl at work lost her grandmother today.  For those of you who pray (I do), say one for her and her family.  Or at least keep her in your thoughts.  She sounded simply terrible.  Her name is Erica.  She also goes by Susan, Sybil and Eria.  But that's another story altogether.   THYME TO CHOP MY HAIRS   The back of my do is getting long enough to braid, which is a nervous habit (among  many ) that I have.  I really don't know how anyone has long hair, unless they're constantly popping Xanax.  I'd have cornrows all over my head if I did.  Right now, there are about seven braids in my short hair.  I look like  Pippi-Longstocking-Meets-Carrot-Top-With-A-Bad-Dye-Job .   GRRRR   The babies are making me insane.  Try three barking Min Pins in a house full of hardwood floors.  The noise can become unbearable.  Perhaps I could write the modern-day version of  The Yellow Wallpaper  and sub those yapping dogs for a baby?  It would certainly be more timely.   FRUGAL SHOULD BE A FOUR-LETTERED WORD   I am not above accepting charity.  There are shoes to be had.  Please, send money.  I do accept PayPal, you know.  Before I sign off to do my ng business plan, I'll leave you with one more  Vicente quotation ...I was defending psychotic behavior with the tried-and-true "I'm a female" excuse, when he retorted and I was speechless.  He asked me a question:  "Didn't your  alien ancestors  tell you this?"  Which one of you   told him  ?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      The property our corporate office is located at makes Kool-Aid, so when I get tired of Diet Coke, I go next door and " borrow " some KA from them.  However, they switched to this funky flavor that is supposed to be Green Apple with some catchy adjective in front of it.   It doesn't taste like any green apples I've ever eaten .  And it leaves you with this slightly minty aftertaste.   Ick.   I'm really sick of it.  Oooh, goody!  I lucked out and found some  CHEESE  in the fridge.  A discovery like that is always a good find.   VICENTE IS PICKING ON ME, STOP HIM!!!   His reply?  Vicente is  the  nicest  .  Some other day, I'll have to tell you all about Vicente's  misadventures  last night...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      "Yes, children, we used to have blogs. We called them diaries, and they got us into almost as much trouble as yours will get you." (Miss Manners' column, Sunday, July 18, 2004)  Miss Manners needs to get out of the 19th century and wake the fuck up.  In earlier times, people were told not to air their dirty laundry, most likely because of the shame it might bring them or their families. People also told their children to be quiet about sexual abuse. Or pregnancy. Or alcoholism. Or whatever.  Today, we live in a different world. Thank God.  Yeah, I chain smoke. Yeah, I drink too much on occasion. Yeah, I like using the word "fuck" a lot. None of this will embarrass me next year, or when I'm 45, or when I'm stumbling around, pissing myself and forgetting to turn off the stove.  By the way, I know which fork to use, how to address someone of a more senior stature than myself, and to say, "Excuse me," when I leave the table. I am happier, however, living in a less structured world. I still say excuse me, but if you are rude to me, I won't think twice about telling you exactly how I feel about that.  Gone are the June Cleaver days and I say, Good riddance. I don't want to live in a society where we simply do not speak of divorce, or suicide, or drug addiction, or children being born out of wedlock. Or incest. Or homosexuality. Or any of the many other things I remember being told as a child that "we just don't discuss those things." Not by my parents, thankfully. But I sure as hell heard it from a number of adults while growing up.  Now I understand Miss Manners is speaking of gossipping about other people. I don't find that in the blogosphere in which I reside. If anything, it seems we're all talking about each other in a flattering way, pumping each other up and doling out encouragement when necessary (and when not so necessary). Maybe I have not crossed over to the Dark Side of Blogging, maybe it exists. That is no reason to condemn an activity that has brought so many people such pleasure, and has provided an outlet for many of us where none previously existed.  I say, Blog on, and blog about what you want to. If you use your blog to criticize others, just remember there may very well be consequences. But I still believe in free speech, no matter how much I may disagree with or dislike what the other person is saying, or writing.  Meaning this:  you are entitled, Miss Manners, to your prehistoric and arcane opinion.  It also means that I, too, am entitled to my own opinion, whether it be criticism of others, of myself or just my wandering thoughts.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I prefer Chicken, but I suppose I should start learning the lingo.  I already know how to lie and to fake that I like people. That's 75% of the job, isn't it?  Plus, my hair is MUCH cuter than either one of theirs. I think a blonde President is long overdue.    THIS WEEK WENT BY IN DOG YEARS    I am so glad to be away from work now. What a fucking long-ass week. By the way, I got out of that Forced Fun Trip to the coast next week because we are simply too busy. Instead, I get to stay behind and fucking work.  I'm stress-eating again and that es no bueno. If I really don't want anything between me and my Calvins, I should start utilizing that gym membership I've had for, oh, five months now. But that would get in the way of sitting here on my ever-widening ass, drinking champagne, eating   CHEESE   pizza and watching Law &amp; Order.    GO CHECK OUT PISSER'S TITS    They look rather enticing in a nongirlfriend t-shirt.    BUNNY WITHDRAWAL    That Fluffy, Happy Bitch high-tails it to North Carolina and won't even post. I need commentary on my campaign, oh Enlightened One. You could be my manager.  Vicente wanted to catch a late movie tonight, after he played around at Banky's house, making some movie (Shit! Is that why the camcorder appeared last weekend?). Ha. I never stay awake past 9:30 these days, only to wake up at two in the morning and not be able to go back to sleep.  According to   Webmiztris  , sleeping helps you lose weight. Just hand me some Ambien and get out of my way! I need to drop about 10 pounds before I go swimming next weekend.  How am I supposed to successfully run for office if I look like I ate seven cheesecakes over the weekend?   I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL   for your grass-roots support of my presidential campaign. I promise to promise you a whole lot of changes and not follow through on about 97.3% of them. Thank you and God bless (even though we aren't supposed to talk about Her).    EARLY TO BED, EARLY TO RISE    Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and well, BORING.    I DUMPED PROZAC IN THE WATER COOLER AT WORK    No kidding. I really did. An entire month's supply. All should be good in August, I think.  Okay, I really didn't, but I need to. Perhaps I can claim that I lost my bottle in a scuba diving incident in the Bahamas and God, you really, REALLY don't want me off my meds?  I have at least four people who can vouch for this.

        "It's not the Left Vote, it's not the Right Vote, it's the ONLY Vote"     I'm voting for myself and you should, too.   Now that I am old enough to run for President, I believe I will.&nbsp; Gonna give Bush and Kerry a run for their money.&nbsp; You heard it here first, kiddos.     Non-Girlfriend For President 2004 - Why NOT?     The first thing I'm going to do is change the red to   pink   in our Red, White and Blue.   Our national anthem will be a Stone Temple Pilots song and   Scottie   will sing at my inauguration.     Snarky Bitch Sadie   will be my running mate.&nbsp; I think she can do&nbsp;not only as good but better than those other two.&nbsp; Combined.&nbsp; Piss the U.S. off and I'll sic her on ya!   Plus, she loves to nap.&nbsp;  I'm bringing back the siesta, babies.    Every Friday, all of Corporate America will shut down at four p.m. and proceed to the nearest bar for National Happy Hour.&nbsp; Bartenders and waitresses will get Mondays off.&nbsp; Pub Crawls will become a national sport and will take up most of ESPN's airtime.   The American Eagle can finally retire - our national symbol will be a   Snarling Min Pin  .   Pro-Choice?&nbsp; You bet.   Gay marriages?&nbsp; Of course.   I'll lobby for stricter punishment against:&nbsp; animal abusers, pedophiles, child abusers, people who scam the elderly and rabid anti-smokers.   I'll follow suit after Leif Wright and legalize marijuana - and tax it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same goes for prostitution.     I will be the Poster Girl for The Immoral Majority.    I will outlaw those damned stretch pants and t-shirts sporting redneck sayings.&nbsp; March will be   Official Chicken History Month  .   And I'll keep a laughing Buddha on my desk in the Oval Office, which I will redesign into an octagon shape.   The pharmaceutical companies will no longer have as much political power as they do now, and neither will the insurance companies.   I'll see to it that Bad Hair Days and PMS are valid reasons for missing:&nbsp; school, personal obligations and work.   It will become a national law to  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS , damn it.   And while we are at it, maybe we should spay and neuter some of the constituents, too.   Hate Crimes will be vindicated.&nbsp; Vodka will become our national beverage.&nbsp; No more sports hero and/or celebrity worship getting you guys off for a crime we all know you committed.

Sorry Bun!&nbsp; I simply cannot handle my cocktails these days.  (And no, the babies did not attack her.&nbsp; Did you really think they would?)  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      My dad had the nerve to tell me that I "need to start eating like white folk" at dinner at my parents' house this evening.&nbsp; Except he calls it "supper."   I am  not  white.&nbsp; I'm European-American and Native-American.&nbsp; But I do have white skin.&nbsp; That's only because I'm sure I already did the damage and will die of melanoma if cirrhosis or lung cancer doesn't get me first.&nbsp; So I keep this pasty white look and long for those younger years when I lived in the tanning beds.&nbsp; Back before I realized mortality will happen to me, too.   That is when I started drinking.&nbsp; And smoking.    "THAT MEANS BEANS AND CORNBREAD"    My mother is a hoot.&nbsp; She told my father, "She eats more beans than anyone I know, including you."   Older Sibling, RD:&nbsp; "Well, that would explain the gas.&nbsp; Have you tried Beano?"   And people wondered why I never introduced boyfriends to my parents as a teenager if I could get away with it.   ** For the record, RD is talking about my post-dining burping that goes on anywhere from two to five minutes after every meal.   It IS necessary, and in some countries, it's a compliment.    CARBS, CARBS AND MORE CARBS    I need to start actually eating vegetables (other than beans) if I'm going to be a vegetarian.&nbsp; I count the tomatoes on&nbsp;CHEESE pizza (via the vehicle of a pizza sauce) as one serving.   Some days, I will eat an entire green bell pepper.&nbsp;  But most days, it's just beans and CHEESE and CHEESE pizza.&nbsp;   CHECK OUT MY NEWEST LINKAGE    I just like saying "linkage" but do go check out Ms. Lunchbox Assassin.&nbsp; Pretty good stuff.    I NEVER DID PREPARE THAT POT ROAST    And now Paddy Mac is on my ass about doing it before the meat goes bad.&nbsp; I tell you what - he is browning that damned thing as I don't want to touch it.    WOULD YOU LIKE TO TOUCH MY MONKEY?    Hey Pisser, I'm curious:&nbsp; who finally "won" the monkey?    WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK    The chickens are restless next door.&nbsp; The hen laid one hell of an egg this morning, going by her bok-bok-bok-bok-boking she was doing.&nbsp; For like TEN MINUTES.   I'm so glad this Chicken has run out of eggs.   The babies are in the den, watching Law & Order.&nbsp; I kid you not.&nbsp; They are.&nbsp; They're in there.&nbsp; Buzzy isn't as interested in the television as he is staring at the blank wall.&nbsp; And blinking rapidly.&nbsp; The little dimwitted tyke is smart enough to tip pillows on my head to wake me up.   Or maybe he's just plotting my demise?   If I don't post again for a really long while, send help.&nbsp; But by the time someone arrives, I'll probably already have half my face gone.&nbsp; Buzzy  does  get quite hungry overnight.    THIS IS GONNA BE ONE HELLUVA&nbsp; LONG-ASS WEEK     Bear with me the next few days.&nbsp; It won't be pretty.&nbsp;   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I hate fucking Mondays.   P.S.:&nbsp; Bunny said this was pretty fucking boring for a post, but Bun, I am at work and my creativity has gone the way of the Dodo, as Pisser would say.   I really, really, really need a vacation and now it's looking like September instead of August.&nbsp; Damn.   There is supposedly going to be NO WORK at our corporate retreat next Thursday, Friday and Saturday.&nbsp; I am taking lots of books and very little alcohol (as I don't like to drink around co-workers).&nbsp; I am doing nothing but lying by the pool all day, taking an afternoon nap, reading and hopefully finding something substantial to eat, as I don't eat any meat at all these days.&nbsp; I've switched back to Lacto-Ovo Vegetarianism.&nbsp; Maybe I cheat with the occasional fish, but not likely these days.   I will be chastised for not hanging out with the group, but I really don't have anything in common with most of them, so I'll consider this a retreat from work as well as co-workers.&nbsp; I might stay in bed and watch Law & Order, who knows?&nbsp; I will NOT go salsa dancing.&nbsp; I will miss Vicente and the babies.

        Best weekend I've had in a long time!      Friday Night    Fab D came over, we had a few cocktails and then Vicente arrived.&nbsp; I fell asleep on the dining room table.&nbsp; Dianne woke up at 6:15 Saturday morning, freaking out because she wasn't sure where she was.&nbsp; Vicente and I went to eat eggs and then he left to run errands.    Saturday    Another Law & Order Marathon.&nbsp; I have a girl crush on Mariska Hargitay.&nbsp; Anyway, that, combined with the Tito's, made for a nap in the afternoon.&nbsp; Vicente wakes me up at 6:30 and shit, we were supposed to be going to my new favorite bar, Lee Harvey's, to watch Oliver's Army play at seven.    Saturday Night    We made it there a little before ten.   This was after V waited on me getting myself all girly, being caught being a Peeping Tom by my neighbor (I was looking at his chickens) and three shots of Tito's so the bar tab wouldn't be so high.   It was anyway.   That last audio post was Oliver's Army, playing Folsom Prison Blues.&nbsp; Lee Harvey's is in the middle of a really bad part of Dallas, but it's so cool and there were several trendy couples there.&nbsp; Myself being half of one.&nbsp; Well, not really.   We sat outside amongst the fucking bonfires they decided to set (only bad part of the evening), listened to Elvis Costello covers, one Johnny Cash song and a part of "Rebel Rebel."&nbsp; The guard dog next door was this pussy of a Pit Bull who gave me kisses and got his back scratched.&nbsp; The rawhide bone (1/2 was left) he was gnawing on was bigger than Buzzy.   Some really hot girl was inside, pole dancing (you could see her through the window), so I went on in and joined her.&nbsp; I think that made Vicente's evening.&nbsp; Our waitress was cool, and we laughed at Vicente and how he was trying to push all my buttons.&nbsp; I went into it with a good attitude and didn't lose it with him, as is usual when alcohol and gigs are involved.   There was some crankhead across the street who stood under&nbsp;the porch light of some seedy little apartments, his nasty bright green t-shirt pulled up to show off his large pot belly.&nbsp; I thought it would be a terrific idea if I crossed the street to talk to him (mind you, this was after the three shots at my house and the three I'd already had at Lee Harvey's), but Vicente vetoed that bright idea.&nbsp; Crankhead walked off through the pseudo parking lot, probably out to score some more.   He reminded me of Chocolate, the guy we met last year at Daytona Beach.&nbsp; Except Chocolate was better looking and funny as hell.    Early Sunday Morning, Around 3:30    Vicente, Paddy Mac and I all agreed it was time to find a better late-night breakfast place.&nbsp; I think my ass-illness today is a combination of all that vodka and the greasy food I got at the Metro Diner.&nbsp; Still, for entertainment value, it rates a ten.&nbsp; I've put on a few really good performances there myself.   This morning, I wasn't the main attraction.   Dreadlock Boys were seated catty-cornered to us, and had just been served while we were on our way out.&nbsp; Walking by, I paused, picked up a tater tot off Dreadlock's plate, dipped it in ketchup and asked, "Do you mind?"&nbsp; Typically, people get a kick out of this.&nbsp; Judging by his pithy remark, I'm surprised he didn't follow me into the parking lot and jack me.&nbsp; I believe he was too stoned to stand up.    Sunday Morning    I did not feel well this a.m. and it wasn't because I drank too much.&nbsp; It was the early breakfast.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; But finally getting a fully-leaded Coke down, and then the vegetable plate at Cheddar's helped.   Ah, but then I faced my greatest fear - the D word in a public restroom.   I was going to opt out of the hike scheduled post-lunch, but got called a pussy by Vicente and Paddy Mac.&nbsp; Two miles in the middle of the afternoon, 70% of it FUCKING UPHILL, I get a little cranky.&nbsp; But I did so much better than the Tyler State Park Camping Incident.&nbsp; Thank God there were no geese around to chase me.   Vicente did keep chunking rocks into the trees, then thinking out loud to Paddy that perhaps we were being followed by a coyote.   Now here I sit, sweaty and stinky and feeling really good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan on hiking every weekend.&nbsp; (Yeah, that'll last about, oh, seven days.)    VODKA CHEESE    My gratis to Who Hymn for the vodka cheese information.&nbsp;   Pisser: &nbsp;  CHEESE, CHEESE, CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!        My thighs are aching, my sinuses are bothering me and I am craving some CHEESE pizza.&nbsp; Other than that, I had the most fabulous time this weekend.   Coming attractions:&nbsp; We decided we will go on the Cozumel cruise after all!    Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I don't have a Dalmatian, though.&nbsp; Just three crazy Min Pins.&nbsp; And a Sephora addiction.    UGH    For some reason (probably because my pot roast is the best you will ever have, if you're lucky enough to have some), Paddy Mac wants me to prepare his Angus beef rump roast tonight.&nbsp; Ick.&nbsp; I really don't have any desire to go through this again but I'm a good big sister, so I will.   Sometimes, I get some pleasure from    patting the rump   .   For those of you carnivores out there,   my rump roast rocks  .&nbsp;  You will want to  swim in my juices .      CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT -&nbsp;GOOD THING I'M A CHICKEN     I started thinking today,  I wonder what all these people who write blogs do for a living? &nbsp; I wonder why some of us are so lucky (Pisser) that they can blog, blog, BLOG at work (and scan pink plastic monkeys) and not get caught.   Whereas I'm lucky to sneak a comment in while people are in the office.   Every job I've had (with the exception of this one and one other), we had   Free Days  .&nbsp; Days where you could   fuck off   all day long and not get fired for it.&nbsp; Once, I left with Stinky to finish off the jello shots my mom and I made for her bday at Vicente's office (pre-Vicente, I didn't even know him then) and three hours later, I strolled back in the office and my boss wanted a word with me.&nbsp; "I just want you to know how happy we are with you and how lucky we feel that you work with us."&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; I'll take more    Dirty Martini Lunches ,    then. &nbsp; Heh!   A lot of people said the determining factor for hiring me (besides the fact that I am   The Most Fabulous  ) was that I could bring a sense of fun to the job.   Now my biggest "fun" is picking at my toenails and wishing I could dye my hair   pink   and pierce my nose.    DELETE    Oh, have I learned the trauma of (a) not deleting something personal on my computer and some co-worker/git finds it and (II) sending a scathing&nbsp;email about someone and accidentally including them on the To: line.   I found a poem written by a co-worker/git today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.&nbsp; And I thought my young angst-ridden love poetry bullshit full-of-shit crap was bad.&nbsp;    I'M GOING TO CATCH A LOT OF FLACK FOR THIS BUT WHAT THE FUCK    STP did a MUCH better job with "Dancing Days" than Zeppelin did.&nbsp; Scottie is my one Star Fucker weakness.     I have a thing for people whose lives are more messed up than mine.      YOU ARE MY  FLOWER , YOU ARE MY  POWER     I'm still so grateful to   Smiley   for telling that story.&nbsp; I think Vicente is jealous of only one other guy and it's a skinny, ex-addict (for now)&nbsp;who could really use some good skincare products.&nbsp; Scottie, what about Botox?&nbsp; "Beer made me what I am today."&nbsp; God, I will always have this immense   crush   on him.    BUT I'M A CREEP, I'M A WEIRDO    Ah, but you all knew  that .&nbsp; I wish I was special.    NO PITHY TITLE    I think this is it until Sunday.&nbsp; Ah, Vicente is back.&nbsp;    Sigh.

      You gotta love Smiley...     Stolen from Ms. Opinionated       FIVE THOUGHTS FOR FRIDAY     Next to getting to spend time with Vicente again, the things I look most forward to this weekend is simply not thinking at all, spending time with the babies, seeing Fab D tonight, wearing no makeup, coloring my hair and    having cocktails   .   I feel bloated.&nbsp; And I have garlic breath.&nbsp; And my angel hair pasta with marinara sauce I had at lunch was disappointing.&nbsp; The tiramisu was good, though, right Bunny?&nbsp; (Hey, don't forget to ask me about&nbsp;  The Boston Tiramisu Incident   I mentioned at lunch today.&nbsp; It involves me, Vicente, some delicious tiramisu and Mary/Lisa never being able to order that dessert again after hearing about it.)   I'm tired.&nbsp; I feel older than I am today.&nbsp; Quite possibly this comes from getting to work at fucking seven o'clock.&nbsp; Note to self:&nbsp; Don't pull that shit again.   I got a ticket this week.&nbsp; And I'm Sephora-broke so I have down to the wire to take care of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whee, I live my life on the edge.&nbsp;   I thought I was supposed to feel this depressed and blah BEFORE my period, not after.&nbsp; Thank God for champagne...

      Yea, Vicente gets back tonight!   He said he wanted a good night's sleep to recover from the Offspring's visit so I told him not to bother trying to get&nbsp;sleep at the Coop.&nbsp; Between my flagrant sexual advances towards him and my three psychotic dogs, good luck with that.   So he's going home, turning off the phone (damn, no drunk dialing!) and "sleeping until (he) wakes up."&nbsp; Then we're off to see Oliver's Army play tomorrow night, and either the pool or Blue Goose on Sunday.   I am craving eggs over medium.&nbsp; But I love BG's fish tacos.&nbsp; What a food dilemma.     LUNCH   WITH   A   BUNCH   OF   ANIMALS     Yep, that's right folks.&nbsp; If you, too, were dining at Gennie's Bishop Grill, you might see a Chicken, a Bunny and a Monkey eating together.&nbsp; Maybe we will audiopost over mashed potatoes and gravy.&nbsp; Thank God for veggie plates at a place that brags about its chicken fried steaks (shudder).

      Vicente called at 6:13 this morning (I had been up since four and felt it wise not to go back to bed) and began harrassing me immediately.&nbsp; I got to work at 7:15.&nbsp; Too bad my boss is on vacation - she would have had a coronary had I strolled in at that hour.   WHEN THE  SHIT  HITS THE FAN   I guess it is a good thing I got in early.&nbsp; It is now 9:47 a.m. and I'm just now getting back to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like this might the&nbsp;only post of the (work) day.

      I want a fully-leaded Coke really badly.&nbsp; Like I jones for a cigarette.&nbsp; I just don't want to have to drive over to the laundry room in this heat to get one from the machine.&nbsp; No one in this office drinks regular sodas.   I have tonight and tomorrow evening to clean my house before Vicente comes back.&nbsp; I will NOT turn on the TV.&nbsp; I will NOT turn on the TV.&nbsp;   Damn Law & Order!    DAMN, COULDN'T YOU AT LEAST HAVE SAVED SOME FOR ME?    Paddy Mac wasn't happy that I drank the last LITTLE bit (like two shots' worth) of his vodka.&nbsp; Which is probably why I fell asleep so early and on the couch, under three dogs.&nbsp; Then I woke at 7:32 (Paddy was probably still pissed so I guess he thought he wouldn't wake my moochy ass up), took a quick bath, didn't have time to do my hair from scratch and left with a headache.  I still have that damned headache.    VACATION, ALL I EVER WANTED    My boss is off for Vegas tonight and won't come back until Monday night.&nbsp; Which means I will be all alone in the office here (my assistant, her sister, is babysitting at my boss' house).&nbsp; I hate being here alone.&nbsp; I swear, this place is haunted.&nbsp; One of our properties is, so they probably hitched a ride with the manager when she brought stuff to corporate.    FUCK IT    I'm going to get that damned Coke.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Yes, Bunny, I'm up again in the middle of the night.

Don't use me as an example.&nbsp; I got started young.   I DON'T THINK I EVER TOLD THIS STORY   One fine Saturday morning earlier this year, I sat watching some really stupid movie, enthralled with its ridiculousness, mesmerized by the television.&nbsp; Paddy Mac walked by, did a double-take and asked, "Why is Nico doing that?"  I looked up right as the little guy lifted his leg and marked me as his territory.  And people wonder why my babies run this house?  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Not only did we drink too much, but we yelled at future ex-convicts, gave police information and drunk-dialed my non-boyfriend a little too much.   Here's to not having your Offspring around and drinking too much at your girlfriend's house.&nbsp; The cops want a written statement.&nbsp; Mary/Lisa lets him in the Coop and&nbsp;I come back inside with a glass of wine and a cigarette.&nbsp; "Nice touch," says Vicente.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm feeling the need to purchase pink flamingos, quickly.&nbsp; Thank God none of my tatoos were showing - that would have completed the picture.  I'd like to sleep all day Wednesday but simply cannot because of Tuesday.   And the last two weeks.   Shit, I have to be at work for a 9:00 a.m. conference call.   The gods of love and war and toothpaste do not smile down upon nongirlfriend.&nbsp; I so need a good housekeeper.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I got the Come To Timmy/Jesus talk today.&nbsp; At least I got a drink beforehand.&nbsp; (One margarita was definitely not enough.)  &nbsp;  So I am better now.&nbsp; For the time being.  &nbsp;   I'M GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO W.T.   &nbsp;  If I don't do my roots/my laundry/my dishes tonight, I may cross over that line.&nbsp; Then that bitch Mary/Lisa offers to pick up a six-pack and head over (no Offspring this week) and I cannot say no, because (a) this rarely happens and (2) she'll soon be moving to The Country, where there are no Starbucks, no DSL and no malls.  &nbsp;   SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS   &nbsp;  It's pretty bad that I call my dogs into the house by simply saying, "  CHEESE  ."&nbsp; It's even more pathetic that I can be called into the house by hearing it said.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  IT'S 3 A.M....DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WEEBLES ARE?  &nbsp; I never had the Easy Bake Oven, either, Pisser.&nbsp; I'm still pissed about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I'm converting to Timmyism.&nbsp; In Timmy's world, hell is a place void of alcohol and laughter, and filled with paper cups.  &nbsp;  I'll be His Disciple of   CHEESE  .&nbsp; And   tomatoes  .&nbsp; I will travel the southwest for Him and spread the word of Timmy.&nbsp; He is proof that God truly  does  have a sense of humor.  &nbsp;   AMEN   &nbsp;  I got booted out of the TV/Dog Room because Paddy Mac was sick of my Law &amp; Order Marathon.&nbsp; Funny, he doesn't pay the sattellite bill but oh well, to be fair, and sense he brought me Cokes and Marlboros, I decided to come in here surf a bit.&nbsp; That's when I learned of  The Second Coming .&nbsp; You see, Timmy/Jesus doesn't have blog diarrhea like I do, so I know it's safe to go a day or so without checking his site.&nbsp; (Timmy, someone asked me that last week, too, about having a case of the Mondays...I don't look so hot in   orange   so I decided not to kill them.&nbsp; Yet.)  &nbsp;   THE BUZZY DANCE   &nbsp;  Whenever Buzzy wants something, or has to pee, he does this circle dance.&nbsp; If it's the Urination Issue, he doesn't growl.&nbsp; However, if it is the   CHEESE   Pizza Issue, he growls in a threatening and downright menacing manner.&nbsp; And snaps my fingers if I give him some crust.  &nbsp;  It's not like the damn dogs are starving or anything.&nbsp; I would guess these babies live better than 75% of our population.&nbsp; And don't chastise me for that.&nbsp; The next time your fucking spoiled-ass rugrat throws a fit in public, remember this:&nbsp; my barking dogs stay at home.  &nbsp;   FUCK IT ALL   &nbsp;  Yes, folks, it's That Time Of The Month again.&nbsp; And I'm in a bad mood.&nbsp; Actually, as Vicente says, That Time Of The Month is no different from the other three weeks but what does he know?&nbsp; He has a penis.&nbsp; (A quite lovely one at that.)  &nbsp;   Here is what I'm pissed off about (like any of you asked, but fuck it, I'm gonna tell you anyway):   &nbsp;  * I'm pissed that I don't like my job more (I'm sick of numbers!) * I'm pissed that Chris Noth is all the way up in NYC and I'm down here  * I'm pissed that I cannot live on wine and cheese and tomatoes alone  * (I actually do live on that, which pisses other people off)  * I'm pissed Sparky got sick and died the way he did  * I'm pissed that the fucking lowlifes who live around my office don't spay and neuter their pets, and let them run freely throughout the property  * I'm pissed that smoking is bad for you  * Ditto on the alcohol  * I'm pissed Leif Wright isn't our President  * I'm pissed that my shopping "problem" doesn't afford me to hire a housekeeper  * I'm pissed that some people I know try to infect me with their lousy moods and get angry when I don't catch it  * I'm pissed that I don't work on The Morning Edge, because they laugh all the time  * I'm pissed that no one at my office except my assistant laughs on a regular basis  * I'm pissed that I don't get paid to blog  * I'm pissed they took "Charlie's Angels" off the air  * I'm pissed that I didn't listen to my parents the last time I bought a car  * I'm pissed that I am about to get my period  * I'm pissed they didn't yank that shit out when they had me open those eight times  * I'm pissed (and fortunate) there isn't a Sephora near me  * I'm pissed I'm not drinking spiked mango snowcones with Bunny by the pool  &nbsp;  Okay, that's enough.&nbsp; People might get confused and think they stumbled over to Pisser's instead.  &nbsp;  Damn it, if I can't watch Law &amp; Order, I might as well visit Crime Library.  &nbsp;  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Can one have a hangover from  too much sleep ?   I just woke up at 2 p.m. and felt like the world's biggest slacker.&nbsp; Okay, so I tried watching "Just Married" earlier and had to turn it off&nbsp;(the dead dog scene was not the clincher - I just hate Ashton Kutcher).&nbsp; I had no more Law &amp; Order to view, and I think I stayed up until about three a.m.    ONLY ONE PACK OF CIGS LEFT AND NO MORE COKE    I'm much more addicted to caffeine than I am nicotine. In fact, ask Mary/Lisa. She will tell you that I never inhale. Okay, I lie, I&nbsp;inhaled this past week and started coughing so hard I thought I might hack up a hairball. 99% of the time, though, the smoke never gets past my teeth. It's an oral fixation. God only knows what I'd do with my mouth and my hands if I didn't have my Marlboros.   No recommendations here, boys. I'd probably just drink more or chew on my fingers.    IPECAC IS OUR FRIEND    I'm so trying not to throw up right now. Bunny, I know about the Cold Vomiting. But what about the Too Much Sleep Vomiting? Suddenly, I feel the need for a nap.   I think I should just go back to bed...    MEMORIES    Paddy Mac dragged out some old photos of himself and of me.&nbsp; Sadly, in 1995, I still had 80s Hair. Then there is the picture of me, RD and Paddy when Paddy was a screaming baby (at least his mouth was wide open), RD was a torturous older brother, and I sat on top of one of those vintage breakfast tables with my curly blonde ringlets, pouting.   I'm still pouting today.   There was also a photo from Christmas 1990, where Paddy looked like the lead singer for some garage band, RD was slightly thinner with a moustache, and I looked like I had just escaped from Auschwitz. I'm thinking the Concentration Camp Look is really not a good  one. Time for more  CHEESE .   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I think I was reading too much Joan Didion at the time.  &nbsp;  And sleeping in the campus library, missing classes.  &nbsp;  I remember being questioned about taking a senior-level Lit class and I was only a Sophomore.&nbsp; Hell, I didn't take Algebra or Biology or anything else for at least a year.  &nbsp;  I wanted to  read .  &nbsp;  I had a class where I had to read 1.75 novels per week to even think about passing.&nbsp; I bullshitted my way through the class, got called on it by the prof, but he liked my essays so much, he gave me a B, "even though I know you didn't read the material."  &nbsp;    I lived for reading.    &nbsp;  When I was a child, my mother had to make me play outside.&nbsp; I would go through two books in one day.&nbsp; In first grade, I was  humiliated .&nbsp; They made me read fifth grade books by myself because I finished the entire year's reading the first six weeks.&nbsp; I started pretending to be dumb.  &nbsp;  But I still kept reading.&nbsp; &nbsp; My older brother used to introduce me to his friends:&nbsp; "She's the good looking one, I'm the smart one."&nbsp; As if the two could never co-exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pfeh!  &nbsp;  Joan figured heavily in the second semester of my Freshman year and I was convinced I was a writer.  &nbsp;  What killed that was getting married.&nbsp;  Twice.   &nbsp;  Then in 1995, I came up with a list late one night, over CHEESE pizza and tequila ( imagine  that!) and I started writing again.&nbsp; Off and on, over the past nine years, writing has been my therapist, my savior, my partner, my way of expressing myself safely.&nbsp;   Lush.   would have never been conceived had I felt the same fear I did pre-1995.  &nbsp;  Thank God for new beginnings, eh?  &nbsp;  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

        urlLink Summer Smith :   Courtesy of  urlLink Bunny , who emailed me about some fellow DFW blogger who "just spied the worst surname (she's) seen in a long time."  Well, Summer,  Smith  is about as common as dirt for a last name, and I happen to prefer the unusual.  Especially since it's my family name.  How on earth can someone criticize someone's last name for NO FUCKING REASON AT ALL?  Unless she knows me and doesn't like me (I find that hard to believe).  I was going to stoop to her level, but no, I'll be the better person.   Please go visit her blog.    Tell her how much you love me.   For some reason, I cannot post a comment on her blog.

      No, I am not.  Not right now, at least.  Give me 14 hours.  I'm gonna need it today.  Fell asleep on my Law & Order date.  S'okay, they understand.  I have all weekend to watch it.  I'm depressed.  My bank LOVES me, however, so I should feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Due to my miscalculation, my bank made $165 off me on overdraft protection fees.  Shit, and it was for small purchases, the largest being $5.39.  I suck at $$$-related things.  I really should give myself a weekly allowance and leave my debit card at home.  But I won't.   SOMEDAY, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR ME   That would be after this weekend, when my brother strips and rebuilds my ill computer.  I've tried to visit my favorite blogs but the damned thing freezes up and porn pops up on my screen.  The only time I can check them is at work, where "down time" is not an option, not even for five minutes.  Next week should be better.  I miss posting and reading - goddamned computer viruses.  Sometimes, it even eats my posts.   PROCRASTINATION   I think my hair has already dried.  Not good.  Could be time to quit and get ready for work, no?

      I'm dedicating this Wednesday to my date with Law & Order later on.  I made a deal with myself this morning:  one good domestic act each evening entitles me to do whatever the FUCK I wanna do for the remainder of the evening.  Tonight, I am cleaning the larger of the two bathrooms.  Then I'm watching back-to-back Law & Order, consuming copious amounts of really, really cheap sparkling wine, and  snuggling with my  babies  .  (I agree with Pisser - they ARE my children and if that bothers you, you can suck their asses.  Wait, you can suck MINE, as theirs are probably much cleaner given the amount of time they spend licking them.)  Then I'm going to post on my blog on my fucked-up computer  THAT MY OLDER BROTHER WON'T FIX, GODDAMNIT!   (Dawnie, if you are reading this, please pass on this  subtle  hint to your husband.)

      Okay, so I copied PETA on that title, but you should see the bumper sticker - it's hilarious!  It's this evil looking chicken holding what appears to be some sort of semi-automatic rifle.  I had no idea that meat producers in the U.S. fed cows, pig and chickens to well, to cows, pigs and chickens.  Cows are herbivores...this makes no sense to me.  I guess because I am one, too.  Well, I'm an Ovo-Lactum vegetarian, but only free-range eggs and organic milk or soy milk.  Still working on the cheese so I don't feel like a hypocrite.   I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY   Culottes (gaucho pants) are back.  For those of you who are too young to remember these, please do not think this is a new and exciting look.  Basically, it is a divided skirt.  Culottes are ugly.  And they are in stores near you.  Scary.   LOOKS LIKE VACATION MIGHT BE MORE LIKE A LONG WEEKEND ROAD TRIP   Fuck the Bahamas, too expensive.  Don't think either one of us will get the time to go on the Mexican cruise.  I guess it's the Texas coast for us.  At least there will be SUN.   I'M REALLY CRAVING CORN ON THE COB   At 10:27 in the morning.  As Vicente tells me, "You're going to a mental institution."  I think I'm already there.

      I tried to get my nails done at lunch today, but my girl was out having surgery on her Adam's Apple???  So I go buy some champagne, dog treats and scoot on back to work.  I heard Jane's Addiction on the way, which brought back memories of the Sparkster.  The first time he heard the dog barking at the beginning of "Been Caught Stealing," he hated Perry Farrell's voice.  It did not matter which JA song came on, he would start growling and lunge at the stereo.  I had to stop leaving the radio on for him while I was at work because, inevitably, I would hear that damned song on the way in.  Funny how you forget things like that and then are suddenly propelled back into your past.  I must have been grinning like an idiot on my drive into work this afternoon.   WORK SUCKS   My NON-boyfriend and I (lest you all get upset again) were talking this morning about how much we don't like to work.  How inconvenient it is that we have to go in the office Monday through Friday.  My best friend and I were talking about it last night.  And a good friend, Banana Pillow, and I spoke this morning.  We are all miserable.   LITTLE PITCHERS HAVE BIG MOUTHS   Apparently my boss' daughter told her our entire conversation last Thursday when I was dropping her off at her mother's meeting about 45 minutes away.  "I didn't know you were a vegetarian.  I've seen you eat meat."  Not since around December but I guess all my talk about complete proteins and forced molting have fallen on deaf ears.   YAWN   Looks like another exciting weekend at the Coop.  Totally spaced about Fab D's trip to the coast and I don't really feel like salsa dancing, so it looks like a hot date with Law & Order again.  No one but Fab D can ever really get me too interested in going out at night, but Bunny can always talk me into coffee and shopping on Fridays.  Bun, you interested?  I won't have to rush back this week or the next...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Normally, I wear some cute little ensemble to work but this morning, I overslept so jeans it was.  I'm putting them on and wondering why the fuck they're tighter than they used to be last week, when I bought them, and then it dawns on my blondeness:  duh, it's that damned 12-pack of fully leaded Coke I drank Saturday and Sunday.  Well, I think Fab D had one of them but please, that many?  What a pig!  The way I figure it, I had over 1,500 empty calories, killed off another little piece of my liver and moved that much closer to adult diabetes.  Not bad for one weekend.  I FEEL NEKKID  My cell phone died overnight and I plugged it in to recharge (I wish I had something I could plug myself into to recharge) and left the damned thing at home.  Heh heh.  It's liberating.  I hate that fucking cell phone (at least for work calls, I do).   I saw someone eating Kool-Aid with a spoon.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

       or Why I Am The Most Boring Person On This Planet    I just spent all day doing this:   watching old reruns of Law & Order, sleeping and not much else.  It's 7 p.m. now and I feel like going back to bed.  In all honesty, I think I came down with something, as I'm running back and forth between the couch and the bathroom (when I'm awake) and I'm parched, like I just went through some Bataan Death March or something.  I have a low-grade fever and the chills.  It doesn't look like a good party night for Chicken.   ROOTS   No, not that television mini series.  My HAIR.  Ugh.  I'm beginning to think my hair is more brown than blonde.  Ick.  Must color hair before leaving house again.  After I throw up one more time.   BRUSH, FLOSS AND VISIT YOUR DENTIST TWICE A YEAR   I swear I was never this sick until that goddamned abscessed tooth last year.  That infection entered my brain and killed my short-term memory.  It also weakened my immune system.  Plus now, instead of brushing five times a day, it's more like eight or nine.  I'm obsessed with my teeth.   FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M GOING BACK TO BED   My boss should be happy.  I wait until the weekend to become ill.  Damn.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Life doesn't get much more exciting than this!   FOF  really bombed, mainly because co-worker who lives to work was there when I brought in the Buzz Man.   I hate workaholics.   Why can't they get a life like the rest of us slackers?  My assistant told me Buzzy sure has gotten fat.  Then she added (lest I become offended, I'm sure) that he looked "really healthy."  My reply?  "No, he doesn't.  He looks like a summer sausage."  I'm quite sure the Min Pin Mafia will be coming after me, but it's not like any of my babies can't walk or something bad like that.  They just have cute little fat rolls on their back.  You can't even pinch an inch.   SOMEBODY STOP ME BEFORE I START WATCHING LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK!   Tiffany Amber Thiesen is on.

      Hey, I spent the first 18 months on this job working until I'm sick and bed-ridden for two weeks.  I ain't about to start that wack shit again.  And I was gonna leave at five but my boss' own mother wouldn't drive her granddaughter out to where my boss was stuck in a meeting.  Guess who did?  Yeah, yeah, nominate me for the Nobel Peace Prize if you get around to it.   TOMORROW IS THE OFFICIAL FIRST EVER FUCK OFF FRIDAY   At least at this job it is.   Things to do on day boss is out of town:   * Blog quite a bit (sorry Timmy!)  * Take Buzzy to work with me for part of the day  * Update insurance schedule (yawn), so it looks like I actually did something  * Take long lunch at Toshio's with Mary/Lisa  * Feel like puking from overeating on the way back in  * Realize I didn't buy liquor for the Cones and Pedicures party; drive into Dallas and pick up VODKA  * Leave work early and go shopping with Mom for party treats (nothing but fattening carbs and CHEESE)  * Go home and frantically clean bathrooms and fold clothes STILL lying on dining room table since I know damn good and well I will not do them tonight!  * Refrain from drinking until Fab D and Bun arrive, as I would like to be awake when they get here (Ninsi, you can come, too - I'll make sure one is a chaperone and monitors my alcoholic intake quite closely)  * Play with the brats, er babies, until company arrives  * Smoke at least fifteen cigarettes by the time they get here  * Convince all party-goers that we must drunken audioblog at least three times  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Was finally organized enough this morning to bring my own lunch and some snacks.  Now I am absolutely full from my tomato bisque, to which I added sun-dried tomato, basil and cracked black pepper feta cheese.  Mmmmm.  Earlier and later, I had/will have more hummus.  I'm being good and dipping celery in it rather than eating it on crackers.  Wow, now I sound like Who Hymn? with all his detailed descriptions of lunches and dinners!   VACATE   I think I may run to the travel agent and check out Nassau packages at lunch.  I've been here since fucking 7:30.  It feels like two o'clock instead of 11:45.  Shit.

If so, please comment.  I never had a bad blind date.  I wanna hear stories!   ALL IS WELL IN THE WORLD OF CHICKEN   Vicente is not so angry with me these days.  To also prove a point (re: interest levels), I called him about 40 times today.  Just to say "hi."  I also had co-workers call him.  One called him and said (in Spanish), "I want to wrap my tongue around your body like a snake."  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I just realized something:  Timmy probably won't notice the post down below, the one about beating my own record.  He'll just think I'm diarrhea-blogging and make another  urlLink Robert Downey Jr.  remark and talk about Mexicans.  Mary/Lisa so needs to meet you, TJ.  She is really quite fond of the  Latin Lovers .  Pedicure Night has been postponed for very obvious reasons.  Nin, Bun, we shall gather together another time.   THANK GOD FOR PADDY MAC   While he and Dale were at the Boat Show a month or so ago, Dale won a free membership to Bally's.  During the hub-bub surrounding that, Paddy took some 1-week-tanning memberships and now I don't have to worry about being the one white girl on the beach at Nassau.  I must remember to ask Vicente if it is a nude beach.  Gotta cut down on those CHEESE pizzas!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      I just ate three and a half slices of some slightly well-done CHEESE pizza.  Okay, they were small pieces, but still.  Oink.   EVEN BETTER THAN COZUMEL   Now Vicente and I are looking at Nassau in late August.  I am looking down at my pasty white legs and thinking, shit.  Not only that, but I’m mainlining CHEESE like a junkie lately.   EYE SPY   I’m taking Bunny’s advice – don’t know why I never thought of doing this via Word.  Guess she has had more practice blogging at work.   SNOWCONE AND PEDICURE PARTY – THIS FRIDAY NIGHT   Bunny will be there, along with Fab D and the three rotten babies.  Ninsi – you are most welcome to come.  THIS IS A GIRLS-ONLY PARTY.  No boys allowed (except Nico and Buzzy).  Hey, maybe we can paint their nails, too?  Bring your fave nail color…I have all the equipment.  And there’s a snowcone shack a mile from The Coop!

      Nico, my youngest of the three babies, has been engaging in a new activity and now has Sadie (snarky middle bitch) doing it as well:   THERE ARE AT LEAST 15 HOLES IN MY BACKYARD!   This just started in the past week.  I don't know if Nico thinks he is a squirrel or what, but it is beginning to irritate me.  A lot.  Had I wanted a beaver for a pet, I would have got one.

      True story.  Three of my co-workers were really stressed on Monday.  Probably because they had to work on a holiday, but that's beside the point.  They decide to take a late lunch.  At lunch, they thought, "Fuck it, let's have a margarita."  One margarita turned into two, and then they proceeded to a few different bars.  You know how they have those annoying bowls of stale popcorn at some bars?  Well, J was nibbling on some, and a piece of it got stuck in her throat.  She's coughing, trying in vain to get rid of the piece of popcorn, to make it go down or cough it back up.  J leaves for the bathroom, where she can try to retrieve the irritating little piece in private.  She vomits all over the bathroom floor.  V heads to the bathroom to help her friend, fearful that she might choke.  She runs into the bathroom, slips on V's vomit, and falls flat on her ass.  Meanwhile, S goes to the bathroom to see what is going on and finds V on the floor with J, sitting in what was left of V's lunch.  Damn, where is a camera phone when you need one?

      I cannot find one that works, damn it!   I WANT A GAY SNOWCONE, DADDY!  I WANT ONE  NOW !   Bunny, you so need to invite me along.  I love gay bars.  I love leaded snowcones.  Just please, PLEASE take away my cell phone so I don't call anyone.  Yikes.   NEWEST ADDICTION   Let's run down the not-so-short list, shall we?  Vicente Min Pins CHEESE Tomatoes Nicotine Vodka Fully Leaded Coca Cola Bean and Cheese Tacos Blogging Checking My Blog For Comments Checking Other People's Blogs For Responses To My Comments Shoes Makeup Perfume Clothes  Now, throw in Watching Reruns Of Law & Order On Dish Network.  And I wonder why my Food Baby won't go away?  Why can't I be addicted to something wholesome, like charity, perhaps, or exercise?   NOT SO SILENT ANYMORE   Things are somewhat better with Vicente.  At least now he is speaking to me.  I'm still not Chicken, though.  Right now, I am So-Called Chicken.  Bok!   TAPEWORMS, LIMA BEANS AND VAN GOGH'S EAR   Someone asked me how I eat nothing but cheese, veggies and CARBS and not gain weight.  It's called Prozac, baby.  (See, Mary/Lisa, I finally admitted it.)  It makes me full pretty quickly.  P is like an appetite supressant.  It's also a Keep Me From Going Off The Deep End And Not Being Able To Leave My Bathtub helper.   I'M SORRY, BUT I AM NOT WATCHING A SHOW ABOUT SEWING ON SOMEONE'S FAKE CLITORIS   Edgy, daring, entertaining as  Nip/Tuck  may be, that's just pushing it a little.  Hey, remember that "Seinfeld" episode?  "Mulva?"  Heh heh.   HACK, HACK   The air quality (lack of) is so bad here in DFW that I might as well quit smoking, move to L.A. and cough up half a lung in three years.   Fuck .  I hate having a sore throat.  Next to liver and Lima beans, there's no worse taste than Chloreseptic.   SHE HAS GOOD VALUES   My mother said this about my second cousin, the one visiting from L.A., trying to find a house/land to buy out here in DFW.  Makes me wonder what she thinks of mine.  The difference between the two of us?   SECOND COUSIN   Married to the same guy for like eight years or something Has triplets and likes being a mom Is a stay-at-home mommy Has had maybe 14 pedicures in her entire life (31 years) Doesn't curse from what I can tell Talks about her children incessantly Looks perfectly beautiful without much makeup Looks like she lives in L.A. (except for the lack of bulbous head) Speaks faster than I could ever hope to speak   ME   Married twice by the age of 25; years spent in Hell (combined): 2.5 Has triplets and likes being a momma to Min Pins, whom she can leave and not worry about damaging their psyche, because dogs have NO concept of time and have no idea what I am saying to them I wish I didn't work - but I certainly wouldn't stay at home - there are shops to conquer! We won't talk about how many pedicures; suffice it to say, it's been a LOT Favorite word is  fuck  Talks about her babies incessantly Looks  perfectly beautiful  without much makeup (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, thought I would try to slip  that  one by ya!) Looks like she lives in Sephora Speaks with a weird, half-baked Texas accent, but has eschewed the non-word "fixin'"   ALWAYS PUT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW WHAT YOU CAN AVOID HAVING TO DO TODAY   Or next week, if you can do so without losing your job.

       First of all , I had to work on a national holiday (well, I got Friday off, but still, I could have gone swimming with Candace and Dale).   Second , still no word from the Increasingly Silent Vicente.  (Chicken is worried.)   Third , my mom made her pot roast and I just wanted to bob for apples in her homemade gravy but restrained myself.   Last , but certainly not  least , I finished on the most incredibly boring project I've probably ever taken on, or at least in several years.  I don't like working with numbers, I don't like analyzing them, either.  I do, however, LOVE making suggestions, so that part was actually fun.  Maybe I should get a job making recommendations to others?  So for all of you slackers who spent the day by the pool, or cooking out, or sleeping in, or just generally fucking off, I hate you.  No, not really.  I'm just insanely jealous.   HERE'S A FAIR  RHETORICAL  QUESTION FOR YA:   Suppose your best friend, or even a close one, asked you if you minded if she went out with your boyfriend from the twelvth grade (supposing also that you are in your late twenties, so it's not like he's a recent memory).  Although you do not want her to, you say yes.  In fact, you encourage it.  You even teasingly call her silly when she expresses concern that it might make you feel bad, or uncomfortable.  Then when she goes out with him, you get mad and stop speaking to her.  Is this fair?  Okay...gotta go finish totally boring project and fold clothes.   Bleah .

      I'm stuffed from lunch again.  Went down to my parents' house to not eat hamburgers and hotdogs with my immediate family, my cousin and her family (her daughter has triplets).   THE POTATO SALAD WAS GOOD   I also ate one really huge tomato.  Some baked beans (vegetarian - at least I hope they were...may have to call mom).  Lots of CHEESE.  Oh and five pickles.  I did not partake in the Fourth of July chocolate cake my mother made because, well, because I just wanted another tomato.   HAD TO LEAVE THE TABLE   Husband of Cousin raises Labs.  "There's no use for a dog for me unless he can retrieve."  I can only hope he was being facetious when he said that it might be dead when he returns to LA.    Ahem .   Then he proceeded to explain just how he trains the puppies to retrieve.  With live pigeons (oh, their wings are clipped, this is just a puppy you know, can't expect him to catch a live bird with fully functional wings now, can you?).  This was after my Second Cousin, mother of aforementioned Triplets, described in GREAT detail what her uncle's melanoma looked like before he succumbed to a horrific death.  While I was  eating .  I guess having babies (especially three at one time) makes your stomach less "unstable."  For the rest of us, there is always Prilosec.  Suddenly, I was overcome with the feeling of pressure to procreate.     Must stay away from childhood home for at least a month, lest I start  ovulating  again.      GET A CLUE:   Please do not share your hunting-and-gathering techniques with a vegetarian.  (And yes, he did know beforehand.)  Other than that, things were great.  Second Cousin seems more laid-back than the last time I visited La-La Land, which seemed counter-intuitive, since she has triplets.  Then my mom told me she is on medication.  Well, hell,  aren't we  all  ?  ( In at least one form or another )  Oh, who the fuck am I to judge?  I drink, chain-smoke and drunk dial my nonboyfriend (and get posts from exes that piss nonBF off... thanks a  lot   - you know who you are).  Plus I'm usually the first one down for the count.   SECOND COUSIN AND LITTER ARE MOVING TO TEXAS   Yes, they are leaving their 1.5 million dollar Huntington Beach home to live in Southlake.  Why don't they do a trial run first?  Come live in my 1,400 square foot, 45-year old, three bedroom house - I have a large yard for the Trips to play in.  I'll stay in your museum-like house (not because it's necessarily huge, it's just one of those houses in which you feel as though you can't touch  anything ) and see how my Min Pins like Los Angeles.  I'll sit in the jacuzzi and drink vodka tonics while making sure I wrinkle up like an old hag by the time I'm 40.  At least I'll have a tan.   BUT WILL I COME BACK TALKING LIKE THAT?   Sorry, but I like my Texas ack-sent.  And that is exactly how I pronounce it.  No, I do NOT use the word "fixin."  Please, I am not  ignorant .  Irony:  After my first divorce, I was seriously thinking of moving out there.  Thank the gods of reason and alcohol I didn't.   SECOND COUSIN TOLD ME I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE I DID SEVEN YEARS AGO, WHEN I LAST SAW HER   Well, now, that certainly was worth having to listen to a couple of the hunting techniques.  God,  I  love  moisturizer  (especially the  No-Age by Dior , but that's another post entirely).   I HAVE TRIPLETS, TOO   They were all just born at different times.  From different mommas.  Sounds kinda ghetto, doesn't it?  And no, I  don't  know my babies' daddies.  My favorite (I don't care if you aren't supposed to have one) is Madison.  She is the fraternal Trip.  The other two are quiet, shy and look exactly alike.  Madison is like a mini version of me.  Kinda of bossy, but really cute so you sorta overlook that.  She has beautiful, naturally curly hair (and knows it), and she told me that my niece said I was her "silly aunt."  I told Cousin about my t-shirts, but not my blog.  Kinda get this feeling their lives are pretty G-rated, or at least PG-13, whereas mine turned up being  NC-17  when I took that quiz.   Naughty  bitch that I am.  Shit, what if they read it?   I GOT THE EVIL EYEBALL TODAY.     I told my mother that I was not a built-in babysitter - this was after I was told to talk to my niece because she was making elaborate plans for the two of us when I told her I was having company over tonight.  That girl is like a fucking Jehovah's Witness until she gets what she wants.  Kind of like her aunt.    The silly one.   FIREWORKS - CAUTION   Kiddos, please use caution when playing with potentially deadly explosives tonight and tomorrow night.  Bear in mind...these things  blow up .  Sometimes they take a finger or two with them.  Or half a face.  A la Buffalo Bill.  Don't aim the Roman Candles at your sister, Johnny.  And Caroline, the sparkler is not intended for internal use, I don't care what you saw at the fair.   KIDS, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME   I'm a sort of cautionary tale, so I think I'll take the Non-Girlfriend Show on the road.  We certainly need many more American versions of the AbFab girls.

      And I'm simply leaving it at  that .   1985...IT'S A SLUMBER PARTY   With nongirlfriend being the First One Down, I became the BUTT of all pranks.   A List Of Things They Did To Me Last Night    *  Wrote really flattering things about me and some enormous green donkey in lipstick on my mirror, my back door and my microwave-that-doesn't-work    *  Hid about 30 pairs of shoes   *  Hid my new clothes in my new cabinet   *  Tried to catch a lizard that was on my kitchen window and put it in bed with me   *  Tapped-danced in my bedroom while Sadie was snarling and yapping at them   *  Left me there and went off to get a tattoo   *  Came back (no luck with the tattoo) and tried to wake me up to go to a graveyard  * Thought about toilet-papering me to the bed but decided that might be a bad idea (they were right)  Let this serve as fair warning for those of you lightweights out there:  get THEM drunk first!

      I think I actually gained seven pounds from lunch today.  Whew!  Oh, and I got the comment, "Oh, so YOU'RE nongirlfriend!"  My reply:  "Yes, that's me.  I'm the one who likes to say " fuck " a lot."   DON'T DRINK, DON'T SMOKE...   That would be someone else's blog.  Now go away, shoo!   BUNNY, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA MAKE IT TONIGHT   I'm feeling slightly ill due to all the CHEESE I ate today.  Pisser, I scooped the CHEESE out of the Four CHEESE Ravioli because I didn't want to fill my stomach with the pasta, I wanted to save room for the CHEESE.

      I'm calling my mortgage company today and finding out about splitting the damned house payment into two per month.  Why is it that everything is due at the same time?  Don't the gods of finance know I cannot hold onto that extra cash I have at the middle of the month, but will instead go out and buy shoes?  Mary/Lisa got on to me about the shoes.  But she did the same thing when she had extra cash.  Now she is waiting for her house to be finished so she can move in.  Now she too knows the joy of owning a home:  no money.  At least I'm getting a new bathroom floor tomorrow.  It only cost me $39 and a carton of cigarettes (bribe money for the maintenance guy to install it).  I have decided against the wainscoting and think now I will just do the textured wallpaper that you can paint, and do some funky paint treatment on that.  And no, you cannot help me paint.  I intend to lock myself up in that tiny shoebox they call a full bath and get high while doing home improvements.  See?  I'm so broke I cannot even afford decent drugs.  Damn.

      I thought better about posting the first part of this entry.   LET'S STICK WITH SAFE SUBJECTS   Bunny and I have plans tomorrow to meet and eat and then Sephora ourselves silly.  Actually, I have set myself a budget of $30 (maybe I'll get some eyeshadow and a lip gloss) because I am broke broke BROKE.  Goddamned mortgage payments!  Feh!  Afterwards, I must clean the Coop because even   I   am beginning to be irritated by the filth and clutter.  Plus, the tile goes in on Saturday.  And then there's the Fourth, and I am quite sure everyone will love to see a clean house, especially if they think I might be cooking (I won't be).   WRONG ANSWER   Thought last night was the last time I'd see V before the offspring arrived.  Not so.  Yea for me, sex again.  That's always a good thing.  Or at least it is with Vicente.   HAPPY BDAY TO ZERO, EARLY   Bunny, when are we going to do my   non birthday ???   BY THE WAY...   I have   THE  BEST  parents.  Someone was watching out for me when I got assigned to them.

      Yes, Virginia, there really   IS   such a thing as too much joy.  (When it comes in the form of eating pizza late at night and doing vodka shots with your nonboyfriend.)  At least I've kept my grilled cheese sandwich down (so far).  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Fabulous night with Vicente.  He decided that instead of "tipsy" he would call me "titsy."  I think I like that better.  Can someone be jealous of a blog?  I think he is.  (He shouldn't be.  I can't have sex with a blog.)   STILL REMAINS   Yes, Bunny, that is the same STP song.  "Our bed we live, our bed we sleep" - that is one of the best fucking songs ever.   I HATE INSOMNIA   At least I am not sleep-golfing like Donnie Darko.   TREE FROGS, STRANGE LITTLE EARRINGS AND CHEESE PIZZA   My gift from the trip to Yosemite:  no, not a shot glass this time (although I ALWAYS welcome those) - I have a darling, tiny sterling silver frog around my neck.  This is a private, inside joke I will not share.  Suffice it to say, the first time I told V the story, he laughed his ass off.  But it only comes across that well in person.   EVICTION   I got threatened with "I'm going home" if I don't get my ass back to bed.  Damn, he must have heard me typing!  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Chicken is flying solo tonight, so I won't frighten the fish with my horrific voice.  Please do not judge Ms. Fab D - she actually has a beautiful voice. It's just when mine overpowers hers, you can't tell.  I'm too tired and too stressed to write about anything right now. Didn't get home from work until 7:15. Now I must go tend to the babies, who are pouting in the other room because I've been on the phone since I got home.  Blah. That's how I feel. Maybe I'll write something interesting later on...

      Blatant ass-kissing to follow.  Vicente is coming over tonight (yea) and so is Fab D.  Supposedly, I am going to receive The Most Fabulous Present that V got me while he was out in Oakland (hopefully, it's not a STD).  First he says I'm The Meanest, then he says he'll just show me a picture and it will be a Christmas gift, then he says he's witholding it completely until the Yuletide season since I don't allow him to accumulate points for gifts given during the year.  I'll weasel it out of him tonight.  I hope it's Jelly Bellys or a picture of a chicken.   SOMETHING'S MISSING ALL RIGHT   Now every time I check out Liz's blog, I feel the need to defecate coming on.  'Scuse while I go shit...   MUCH BETTER NOW, THANKS   I really don't have much to say tonight.  My belly is full of corn and tomatoes and I feel the urge to purge coming on.  By the way, how lovely is this?  They aren't serving anything at our company picnic (on Wednesday) that I can eat, so I'm swinging by a Subway on the way there.  "Oh, you just have to be different..."  I can hear it now.  Think I'll take my pictures of what happens to the cows, pigs and chickens along for lunchtime reading.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Well, Bunny finally called me back after I left a nasty voicemail on her cellphone, telling her to get her lazy ass out of bed, it was nine in the morning, what was she thinking??  Actually, what the fuck was I thinking? I went to bed at ten (fell asleep, passed out, whatever you want to call it). Now there are two people in my den, sleeping, and I really want to watch TV.    Bunny   had some interesting observations about the interactions of the party-goers. The men did seem to only socialize with each other (as she put it, "like a junior high boy-girl party"). I suppose I am just used to it. I was a class act, wearing my "Hello, My Name Is High Maintenance" pajamas, no makeup and wild-ass hair. Then I go look at   Vampy  's blog, and she and   Liz   are all sexed up, looking hot (and Liz looking fabulously drunk), and I think to myself, "Why can't I look like that drunk?" I just look like a teenager on her first binge.  Oh well.   Surveying the damage this morning:  3/4 of a German chocolate cake left; hardly any cheese (those bastards!) - that Havarti was amazing, thanks mom!; half of my vegetarian seven layer dip (my mom brought cocktail weinees up - "boys like to eat meat, Carol!"); the Rotel queso is almost gone; not many people touched the hummus (good, more for me!). Oh, and the vodka - yikes. We went through that entire bottle of Tito's (jug is more accurate), half the green apple Smirnoff and 1/4 of the plain jane Smirnoff. No wonder everyone is still asleep.  Except for   the Chicken  , who is insomniatic. Thanks, "friends," for trying to wake me up from my drunken stupor. I cannot handle my liquor. And don't ask me what happened, because you know I always forget, Vicente.    Speaking of   Vicente   , he  was probably charming the pants off some poor, unsuspecting Oakland babe. I could have warned her.  Damn, we didn't videotape the party. Harvey showed up with his young and beautiful wife, Jenny, who does not drink, so I'm sure a bunch of drunk idiots were  lots  of fun for her.  We had an interesting conversation re: the rest of you bloggers out there, and all of our nicknames. People I never suspected of reading this crap I churn out do, and that really surprised me. (Yeah,   Marky Mark  , I am referring to YOU.)  By the way, please don't refer to me as Carol. That is my middle name and I absolutely HATE it. Given that, I think I am going to change my name to my father's, which I will not reveal in here so as not to embarrass an innocent man, announcing to the world he has a potty-mouth, drunk-ass daughter who loves   CHEESE  . Suffice it to say, it's very unusual and would be so cool for a girl's name.  Forgive me, fellow vegetarians, I love the animals but will never ever give up   CHEESE  . Isn't it enough of a sacrifice that I decided today to give up the fish, too? I'm not a saint, you know. (Like that was ever called into question, heh.)  Today is my buddy Walt's bday. Happy happy, hope your nongirlfriend took you someplace nice last night. Hope you got some, too - everyone should get laid on their birthday. Hell, everyone should get laid every day - we wouldn't have near as much conflict. And a lot less road rage, if you ask me.  My mother was so not happy with her daughter when I told her I offered my neice some hooch. It is my opinion that making drinking seem like one of the    seven deadly sins    serves to make it seem more attractive to a child, since my parents were teetotalers and look what happened to me. By the way, had she said yes, I wouldn't have given it to her. I'm a mean aunt, huh?  I feel a cheese pizza calling my name.  Must. Stay. Away. From. The. Phone.  I already went back up to a size six. It couldn't possibly be that I drank three Cokes this morning and consumed all that alcohol and Coke last night. That cannot be it. I'll just blame it on PMS, like I do everything else. Even though I'm not supposed to have it until next week.  Shh , don't tell Vicente.  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Paddy Mac's bday bash was a successful event.  Old friends showed up, Tito's was flowing, bagpipes were played.  I danced with my neice and Bunny, Dawnie and I lusted after Scottie while watching the Thank You DVD.  My mother told me this morning that she asked my neice if she had a good time.  "Oh, yes, grandma.  It was the best party ever!  Grown-ups are so silly, and the men are the worst of all!"  Learning young...  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Hey,   that   got your attention...  Say Hello to STAN THE MAN, who gets turned on by girls talking about shitting. We love ya, baby!    PAPPABLOWS     Don't ask me why I even risked it, but today now makes the THIRD time I've become ill from eating crab cakes. Perhaps it is getting to the point where I cannot stomach any flesh? No, because I had eggs for breakfast, and besides, Bunny got sick, too. She had the same exact thing I did.  Fucking copycat bitch!  (You know I love you, B!)    WE'RE ALL WINNERS    But suddenly, there's a new contender...    I'M JEALOUS OF PISSER    I'm jealous of Pisser's job, where she gets to stargaze; I'm jealous of Pisser's tits, which are much bigger than mine; I'm jealous of Pisser's red hair, because when I tried to go that route, I resembled Ronald McDonald (including the makeup and the big shoes).  Plus she has that    sexy Meerkat Love thing    going on. All I have are   Three Pink Monkeys  .    ALL MEN ARE IDIOTS AND I MARRIED THEIR KING (AND CROWN PRINCE)    Eew. That just gave me the shivers.    VICENTE, WORLD TRAVELER    Oakland Bloggers, Attention: Watch out for a man who looks like a greyer version of Dubya, who laughs a lot and who is The Most Fun. He is invading your city this weekend for much misbehaving. His sidekick, Banky, will be with him. Banky is this sweet, adorable guy who shaved his head and looks pretty damned good bald.  I'm still pissed he didn't invite me along. I'm suspicious because I think this aforementioned trip involves out-of-town 'tang. V, wear a condom if you do.  Wear TWO.     FINITO    This is it for tonight. I have to clean (ick), watch Law &amp; Order (whee) and entertain Jason, of the The Devil Lives In Carl's Corner Jason.  And I gotta go love on my tap-dancing dogs.  Promise to post some drunken audioblogs tomorrow night. Much embarrassment to come (especially since we're VIDEOTAPING the entire thing!).  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      Vicente's gift - Richard   CHEESE  's CD, "Lounge Against The Machine," arrived today. I can hardly wait to listen to a Lounge Music version of NIN's "Closer."  I wonder how he pulls off "I want to fuck you like an animal" while sounding like Tom Jones?  You gotta love a guy named Dick   CHEESE  , you know?   TWENTY-SEVEN THINGS YOU WILL NOTICE UPON FIRST SETTING FOOT IN MY HOUSE:   1. I'm nowhere near as neat as   Jaden   2. The absence of a leg on an antique table that  used  to hold my fish tank 3. A whole lot of   Min Pin hair   4. I often use my dryer as a dresser 5. The wallpaper in my larger (if you can call it that) bathroom looks like it jumped out of a Charlotte Perkins Gilman short story and attached itself to my walls 6. I have an exercise machine-type thing that I haven't used 7. My den resembles a ski cabin 8. There are two sofas - one was used as a chew toy by the late, great Sparky; the other is a cast-off from my mom's house 9. The air freshener in my bathroom is Paddy Mac's car air freshener (scent: New Car - just what everyone wants the   peepee place   to smell like) 10. One of my bedroom doors is covered in stickers, photos, It's Happy Bunnies, Anne Taintor images and a naked picture of Scott Weiland playing the piano 11.   CHEESE   12. A basket full of about 40 magazines, two of which I've actually sat down and read (most likely while on the toilet) 13. A lot of dust 14. Several ash trays 15. About 15 lighters 16. A not-often-used-enough "peace pipe" 17. Rob Lowe 18. Three yapping Min Pins (you actually notice them  FIRST ) 19. Books and software programs just tossed about 20. Cigarette ashes, and plenty of them 21.  VODKA  22. Thongs with the crotches chewed out 23. A shrine to Sparky 24. An 18-speed bike that I have yet to ride 25. 99 bottles of beer on the wall 26. 99 bottles of beer 27. The gnome that lives under my bed  Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      My new bathroom floor looks pretty good. Now for the walls...   BUNNY, YOU CAN COME OVER TONIGHT AND HELP ME CLEAN   Or not.  I still cannot believe she could hear my side of the conversation with Mary/Lisa when I put her on hold on my cell phone. That could cause problems.   TIJUANA OR SAN FRANCISCO???   For vacation this year, Vicente scored some free tickets anywhere in the Continental U.S. He's thinking San Diego then driving down to Tijuana. I'm thinking San Francisco and lots of Rice-A-Roni. Chicken flavored, of course.  Ooh, that reminds me: I just received my Vegetarian Starter Kit yesterday. Just out of curiosity and for vegetarian protein tips, I signed up for one from PETA. I tried to show my mother what happens to the pigs, chickens and cows but she got upset with me and walked into the other room.  Ain't nobody gonna force-molt  THIS  Chicken!   IS IT FRIDAY YET?      unfortunately, that would happen to be tomorrow    sigh   Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

      It being Dedication Wednesday and all that, above title goes out to that toboggan Scottie wore in the 10 Years Of Sex Type Thing video on STP's Thank You DVD.  More nudity, Scottie. I must see your ass again.  (Actually, Vicente's is much cuter, but it pisses him off when I long for Mr. Weiland, so I keep doing it.)   THAT BEING SAID...   Remember that poor kid who never got chosen for dodgeball? The one that, when it came down to which side would take them, both captains tossed a coin to try and   NOT   have to have them on their team?  Welllllll, that is exactly how I feel right now.   [DELETED FOR POSTERITY]    THE DEVIL LIVES IN CARL'S CORNER   So sayeth Jason, premier bagpipe player.   DON'T HIDE YOUR LIGHT UNDER A BUSHEL   What the fuck is a "bushel" anyway?

       What is my favorite sexual position?  Doggy-style   White meat or dark meat?  No meat. Ick.   If I had only one hour left to live, what would I do?  I'd spend it drinking fabulous (real) champagne and eating Mr. Jim's thin crust cheese pizza, surrounded by: Vicente, Sparky, Sadie, Buzzy and Nico, Mary/Lisa, Fab D, Paddy Mac, the rest of my family and Scott Weiland   Who is my favorite comedian?  Tough. Toss up between Vicente and Pisser. They both make me laugh so hard it's a wonder I haven't yet pissed my pants.   If I had to use only one adjective to describe myself in a nutshell, what would it be?  Psychotic. What else did you think it would be?    HAPPY BDAY PADDY MAC!

      I rewrote the lyrics to "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" in my head today at work. Bono would be so proud.   ARE WE THERE YET?   Wow, it isn't often that I skip an entire day without blogging...  Why do Mondays so suck ass? Everyone I talked to today hated their entire work day. Not even one little moment of happiness was bestowed upon me between the hours of 8:15 a.m. CDT and 5:42 p.m. CDT.  I felt like the girls in "Clockwatchers."   SOMEDAY, EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU   Chut up!  Time for another stupid, fucked up list. I know you have all been going through withdrawal.   RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW     Favorite time of day?   When I am leaving work    Favorite song?    God, what a question. How about a Top Five list? "American Pie," "How Long?", "Still Remains," "Lithium," and "Wrong Way."    Favorite animal?    Vicente  Goddamn, this is  BORING . How about a Jeapordy questionnaire that   YOU   all get to fill out with the answer you think I'd be most likely to give? I will provide the answers when you are finished.    What is my favorite sexual position?      White meat or dark meat?      If I had only one hour left to live, what would I do?      Who is my favorite comedian?      If I had to use only one adjective to describe myself in a nutshell, what would it be?    I look forward to your guesses. Just don't bet the bank on my answers.
