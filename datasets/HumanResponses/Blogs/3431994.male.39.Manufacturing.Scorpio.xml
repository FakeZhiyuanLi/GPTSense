      Sitting there that morning in the dump that I lived in, feeling the effects of last night’s booze and smoking a cigarette, I wondered how my life had gotten so twisted and turned around.  I was in my mid-forties at the time and my life was shit.  As I sat there, dreading having to go to work, it was hard to believe at one time I thought I had the world by the tail and was going places.    A couple of years after I got out of high school, I got a job at one of the local factories.  It was a big-name company that paid pretty decent for the area.  Soon after that, I got married to my high school sweetheart.  By my late twenties, we had two children and I had made supervisor at the factory.  After the first couple of years of marriage, my wife and I graduated from a used trailer to our so-called dream house.    The house was a twenty-year-old ranch style house, with red brick and white trim.  The only thing missing was the picket fence.  In those days, we were concerned with the lawn and how my wife’s flower garden looked.  We were the typical young married couple during that time.  We liked having friends over for a bar-b-que.  My buddies and I liked to get together on Saturday afternoons in the fall and watch college football and drink beer.  Before the children came along, my wife landed a job in another factory in town.  In our early twenties, we made more money than a lot of people who were two decades older than us.  We got to go on a decent vacation every year and for the small southern town where we lived, we had it good.    After almost fifteen years of the good life, it all faded away in a few short months and I never was quite sure what happened.  Our marriage seemed to be rocking along fine one day and the next it was blowing in the wind.  In my mid-thirties, I was on my own for the first time.  I found out loneliness was all it was cracked up to be.  To pass the time, I began to drink more and more.  At first, I just put away the beer.  After a while, I moved up to whiskey.  I’d sit there in that beat-up old trailer and drink and play my guitar.  It wasn’t long before I lost my job because of my drinking.  When I fell behind on my child support, my ex-wife got ugly about it and had me thrown in jail.    My parents were sorely disappointed to see what I had let my life become.  At first, they tried to help me, but they washed their hands of me before it was all said and done.  I remember the chewing out I got when my mother announced I had to want to help myself before they could help me.  It pissed me off to hear it, but she was right about it.    I moved around a lot for several years, for the most part, trying to stay ahead of my rent.  I went through jobs like there was no tomorrow.  Sometimes, even I was surprised that I was able to find so many jobs.  About five years ago, I took a job with a guy finishing concrete after it was poured.  My boss drank about as badly as I did, so we got along pretty well for about a year.  It was long enough for me to learn the ins and outs of the business and strike out on my own.  While I worked for the other guy, both of us stayed drunk a lot of the time, even when we were working.  It was not unusual for us to start the day with a couple of beers and have a six pack at lunch.    It was the kind of job for me because I could work when I wanted to and lay around drunk the rest of the time.  I got paid in cash a lot of the time so my ex-wife’s live-in boyfriend didn’t know exactly how much I made.  When I fell behind on my child support, she would invariably have me thrown in the pokey.  If I didn’t have the money, I had to ride it out in there until they realized I couldn’t pay them while I was in jail.  When I got out, I’d have to work pretty hard for a while and then lapse back in to the same old rut.  Fortunately, I didn’t have to worry about getting fired since I worked for myself.    For a couple of weeks, I noticed a tent preacher had come to town and set up near the edge of town in an empty lot.  It struck me funny that he had an old late 70’s vintage step van parked out beside the tent that he used to carry his gear.  There was an old flashing arrow sign out front stating there would be tent meetings every night at 7:00 p.m.  It said the preacher’s name was Aubrey Stonehill.    I remember shaking my head when I saw it the first time.  My parents always told me about tent meetings they went to as children.  The services would last all day in the hot, humid southern summer.  Some guy would get up there and scream and yell about the evils of the world and the need for repentance.  I wondered of this Stonehill guy did that too.  Both my parents had been very active in the church all their lives.  My mother was the strictest of Baptist women and told people her “oldest boy had gone sour”.    One morning, I was working a job replacing the curbing along the street where the preacher had his tent set up.  I had my usual semi hangover and was unloading my gear right in front of the tent.  I used the driveway to park.  I was going to have to use a jackhammer and bust up the old curbs and a carpentry crew was going to build forms.  Then I would finish the concrete.  I was in a pissed off mood because I had to run the jackhammer.  I usually just finished the concrete, but I agreed to it because I needed the money.    It was about 6:00 a.m. and I wasn’t trying to be the least bit quiet as I was unloading my truck.  I really hadn’t given any thought to anyone being around.  After a couple of loud bangs, I began to hear something coming from the old beat up looking step van with they guy’s name painted on it.  The van itself looked like it was painted with spray paint bought from Wal-Mart.  The noise from the van got louder and the van began to shake hard enough for the shocks and suspension to squeak.  Finally, I could see a figure with no shirt rummaging around the cab and got out of the passenger’s door.    At first, I was puzzled by what I had seen and then I realized what was going on.  I could smell a cigarette burning on the other side of the van and decided to investigate.  As I walked around the van, I saw him standing there with a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, taking a piss beside the van.    It made my day.  All of a sudden, I wasn’t pissed off about having to run a jackhammer later. The good preacher had a worse hangover than I did and I thought it was quite funny.  I said, “Preacher, feelin’ a bit under the weather, are we?”    He just made a long grunt without saying anything.  Finally he mustered, “Yea, yea.  It musta been that spicy cookin’ from some of the congregation.”    “Smells like cheap-ass whiskey to me.”  I said laughing.     “Boy, I feel like shhh…I mean I feel rotten, friend.”  He said still trying to hide the fact that he had been on a bender.  “I’m just kinda…”  “Give it up, Preacher.”  I told him.  “Is there anything I can do for you?”  I asked.  “What’s good for a hangover?”  He asked.  I laughed out loud and said, “You wasn’t bullshittin’ me.  Tell you what, I’ll go to the convenience store across the street and get us a home remedy for the hangover and once you feel great in an hour or so, you can help me run that jackhammer so I can get caught up from takin’ time fuckin’ with you here.”   “Deal.”  He responded.    I went across the street and as I was standing at the counter with two twenty-two ounce Budweisers, some guy in a dress shirt and tie came in to pay for gas and buy chewing gum.  He looked kind of funny at me when he saw I was buying beer before 7:00 a.m.  The clerk looked funny too.    The preacher was surprised to see me return with two big beers and asked, “What’s this?”  I said, “Have a little of the hair of the dog that bit you last night.  Best thing for a hangover there is.  Take it from me, I got a lot of experience.”    “Me too.”  He replied.  “Well, come on in the house.”  He said walking toward the step van.    I thought to myself, “I can’t believe this son-of-a-bitch is a boozer livin’ in this van and preachin’ for money.”    He had a nasty old cot in there where he had been sleeping and a half-empty Jim Beam bottle and a few empty beer cans.  We sat there and drank the beer, only chatting a little.  Feeling much better, I was ready to get to work.  The preacher started to come around.  Sure enough, in about an hour or so, he relieved me on the jackhammer and helped me finish the job.  I finished up the concrete about 2:00 that afternoon and had another job lined up that day.    I wasn’t at all disappointed for it to come a good rain, causing me to postpone the other job I had lined up.  The preacher and I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle and some beer and headed to my place.  I just had to hear his story.  And, since I couldn’t work, I figured I’d get plowed for the rest of the day.    The preacher’s story was very similar to mine.  The marriage went bad, he was down on his luck and he happened up on the guy he presumed was actually Aubrey Stonehill and bought the truck and tent.  He went to a few services and learned the ropes and hit the road preaching and collecting at the offering plate.  It was a pathetic living for someone who was not even religious, but I guessed someone had to do it.  He said he was tired of it and wanted out.  True to form, I was tired of the concrete business.  And, in a drunken stupor, it made perfect sense for us to swap job skills just like the parable in the Bible.  I could teach him to finish concrete and he could teach me to preach.    I was surprised at how organized he was.  He had many passages highlighted and even had a color coding system to tell which sermon went with which passage.  He had two weeks worth of sermons readily available and didn’t usually stay longer than that.  If he did, he would just sort of combine some parts of the sermons together and do a lot more shouting and pounding of the pulpit than usual.    We agreed to swap equipment and I let him crash at my place so we could share the drinking money and he was less likely to get caught by someone attending his services.  I started going to the services and seeing what he did.  I actually thought I could pull it off and was willing to try.  I could always come back and swap back with him.  The rumor was going around that I had found religion and was attending tent meetings every night.  My mother was so proud.  She came to visit and could hardly get into the house for the empty beer cans.  I was drunk when she came and just laughed about the episode when she stormed out mad.  I knew my secret was safe with her because spreading that about her own son would reflect badly on her.  So, she went along with it when someone asked her “if her boy had straightened up.”    When I found out my ex-wife was marrying that preppy smart-ass that was bossing my kids around in my former house, I decided to hit the road.  I searched the map for a good spot to go first and had to be sure the stranger had not been there recently enough for someone to recognize I was not him.

      Writer's Note: This is a fiction story, but it came to mind when I was getting ready to go to my 20 year reunion.  The Phenomenon  For the past several days, Tim Johnson had a funny feeling of dread everytime he thought about the weekend.  Although he still lived close to his hometown, he had drifted away from most of his old friends.  Twenty years had passed in the blink of an eye and many of the old memories of his glory days no longer seemed real – they were more like a dream, viewable through a dirty glass window.  He had gone to the five-year reunion, and had actually looked forward to it for weeks beforehand.  But a strange phenomenon had occurred while he was there.  TJ, as he was called by all his friends, was kind on the cusp of the in-crowd.  Actually, during his school days, he always believed he was in the in-crowd until adulthood took over and hindsight convinced him otherwise.    TJ hung around the in-crowd, and his closest friends were among the in-crowd.  But, he was different in that many of his classmates that weren’t in the in-crowd liked TJ.  He didn’t snub them and was always nice to them.  He hung around with many of non in-crowd from time-to-time, which wasn’t very popular with the in-crowd.    After his school days, the folks whose parents had money, moved away or became prominent, or as prominent as one could become in a small southern rural Mississippi town.  They were bankers, insurance agents, store-owners or the owner of some small sweat-shop of a factory.    TJ’s parents had about as much money as most of the ritzy people, as his dad was a highly-paid union worker, and his mother was a secretary.  Together, they earned a pretty good living and had a nice house, but a blue-collar worker didn’t rank as high on the pecking order as did a banker or store-owner.  At the five-year reunion, all the cliques that existed in high school somehow magically reformed and it was almost like they never left.  The in-crowd was huddled in little groups of in-crowd people.  The middle-class crowd, which consisted of band members, academic club members, were in little groups, and the scumbags were huddled with the scumbags.    One funny side note was some of the non in-crowd people were already pretty successful, and they tried to penetrate the barrier, thinking they’d earned the right.  Strangely, they were just as outcast as they’d been in high school.  The in-crowd was a closed club and they weren’t welcome.    TJ was welcome, but much like high school, he stood on the periphery, only a small part of the conversations.  After it was over, he wasn’t sure what to make of it.  He thought about it intermittently for some time before he figured out that he wasn’t as in-crowd as he’d thought during school.    After he discovered the phenomenon, TJ had no interest in going to another reunion.  When the class president called him to tell him about the 20-year, he tried to politely turn them down.  At the end of a short conversation, he left it open, saying he would come if he could.    A few weeks later, at a local charity function, several of his classmates cornered him and roped him into agreeing to come.  Many times, he thought about standing them up, but his wife insisted he go since he’d promised.    When the day came, TJ thought of a hundred excuses why he wouldn’t have to go, but none were good enough to get past his better half.  In essence, he was angry when he found out that he wasn’t as much in the in-crowd as he had always believed.  After all, he’d gone to great lengths to get to that status.  TJ sweated and toiled long hours on the football field and basketball court and baseball field to get there.    He wasn’t a great athlete, but he was a disciplined athlete, listening to the coaches enough to follow fundamentals.  That and desire were enough to make TJ a starter throughout most of high school.  But, like everything else, he toiled on the low end of the totem pole.  He wasn’t the quarterback or point guard or pitcher.  TJ was a valuable team player, but not one of the headline grabbers; just a solid player that the team could always count on.    When he and his wife arrived at the reunion, he mingled among all divisions of his class, noting that the phenomenon was still alive and well.  TJ was determined to not be a part of it.  At some point, a fairly large group was standing around chatting, asking what each other had been doing for two decades.  Uncharacteristically, it was a mixed class group, with one of the former middle-class classmates named Anthony Baker, who was still trying to penetrate the in-crowd making an overt effort to carry the conversation.  At some point, Anthony turned to TJ and asked, “so TJ, you were in the army, weren’t you?”  “Yes, for eight years,” TJ replied.  “Didn’t you go to the Gulf in ’91?”  “Yep,” TJ replied.  TJ wasn’t too hip on Anthony, nor his demeanor.  He wondered if he just didn’t want Anthony to be admitted to the in-crowd.  After all, although he wasn’t an important member, he was still a member and he still had a say-so.  Snubbing him was a clear vote of no admittance.  “So, did you whack any towel-heads while you were there?” Anthony asked arrogantly, trying to make himself look big, obviously thinking he knew the answer was no.  His question stunned TJ, and for a long moment he stood frozen in time.  Until that point, nobody had been bold enough to ask him that question directly.  Several times, people had hinted that they would like to know, but TJ never obliged them with an answer.    At that split second, his mind raced back twelve years.  He could see the dust blowing all around, smell the diesel fumes from the Bradley fighting vehicle that he was riding atop of.    When it all happened, TJ didn’t have time to think about it.  It was his job, and he wasn’t there out of vengeance or malice, like a murderer or criminal.  He was in the army and his unit was called to war.    Once the ground campaign had commenced, his unit had moved very quickly through the desert.  TJ was in an M-1 Abrams Tank Battalion, where he was the crew chief and gunner of a Bradley.  During the first day or two, all they saw was Iraqi soldiers wanting to surrender.  For the poor slobs left on the front line, they were starved, thirsty and shell-shocked.  All they wanted to do was quit and find some food and water.    As the unit was speeding toward Kuwait City, they ran headlong into an Iraqi unit of Republican Guard that had some fight left in them.  At one point, there was nothing but M-1’s and Bradleys in a line, the next minute it was like the fourth of July.  The desert just lit up.    The Iraqi’s weren’t well trained, and they began firing long before they were in range of the Americans.  Once they gave away their position, it was like a shooting gallery for TJ’s unit.  American tanks were demolishing Iraqi tanks, and the Bradley’s were attacking any other vehicles and foot soldiers.  TJ looked through his thermal scope to acquire targets through all the dust and haze that descended on the battlefield.  When he saw smaller vehicles, he fired them up with his 50-caliber machine gun.    The 50-caliber machine gun was a very powerful and very lethal weapon.  It could disable a vehicle by simply tearing through it and shattering whatever parts it hit.  For the rounds that might have hit any human, their chance of survival was minimal.    During the battle, that seemed to last a lifetime, and it did for many Iraqis, there were several occasions when TJ saw several soldiers hiding behind a dune.  He fired them up and never saw any movement afterwards.    It wasn’t until after the war that TJ actually gave serious thought to having ended the lives of other humans.  He couldn’t actually confirm that he did, but he was reasonably sure he had.  It was inconceivable that he hadn’t with all the targets he hit during the battle.    For the most part, TJ didn’t think about that day, and he rarely allowed himself to think about the targets he engaged, especially the outcome of the engagement.  But, it hit him particularly hard when Anthony questioned him so directly.    Once he asked the question, you could have heard a pin drop.  All the chatter ceased as everyone standing around awaited a response.  When there was no immediate response, everyone knew the answer.  TJ felt especially awkward, even his wife had a funny look on her face, as she looked at him.    Once TJ was able to regain some semblance of composure, it made him angry.  After serving his country, and actually putting his butt on the line, TJ didn’t believe he should be accosted with such a question by someone trying to elevate his status in the crowd class twenty years after graduation.  So, he decided to be just as much of a smart ass as his classmate.  “Well, Anthony, I guess you could say I am the first person in our class with a confirmed kill.  Anything else you’d like to know, but shouldn’t ask?”

      It was a strange time in a strange place with strange people doing strange things.  The clothes were different and everything smelled funny.  People had funny looking haircuts and strange accents.  They came from places I had never heard of and lives I could not have imagined.  They had strange names and ways and listened to strange music.    My first day in the military was the strangest day of my life to date.  I was twenty years old and had never been out on my own.  I spent my last few days at home going to see everyone I knew and saying goodbye.  I knew I would be gone for at least 3 or 4 months, which was by far the longest of my life.  The recruiter was good enough to drive me to the processing station rather than putting me on a bus.  However, he wanted to get me there about the time they started processing at 5:00 a.m.  This meant we left my hometown at 11:00 p.m.  I knew of these plans for several weeks before I left, but the day before leaving, I contacted him to confirm them.  He had forgotten and offered to take me the next day.  I told him I had to go that day and after reviewing my file, he remembered he had to take me.    I arrived at the MEPS (Military Enlistment Processing Station) and was billeted about 4:00 a.m.  I tried to sleep for the hour I had left, but could not.  I knew the life ahead of me would be different than anything I had ever endured.  But, there was no way I could fully envision what was ahead of me.  One of the things that prepared me for the days and weeks ahead was playing sports in school.  The discipline that was instilled in us was invaluable.    The next day would be the beginning of a change that would shape my entire adult life and I could not fully appreciate that until years later.  There was a great deal of processing and a less intense physical than we had during the induction process.  After the processing, we were officially sworn in and sent to the airport.  I had only flown once on an exhibition flight for the boy scouts.  I had never been in an airport waiting to catch a flight.  That day, I was about to have to find my way in one of the biggest airports in the country.  But, for the time being, I had a layover even before I left.  We arrived at the airport in Montgomery, Alabama at midday.  My flight did not leave for four more hours.  There were only two other guys enlisting that day left after the first 45 minutes.  Both of them were going into the Navy and wouldn’t have anything to do with me.  So, there I was, 14 hours away from my parents and hometown and I felt the most alone I had ever felt before.  It was 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon and I had not slept since 8:00 the morning before.  I was doing my best to tag along with the two Navy guys, but managed to fall asleep in the uncomfortable chairs in the airport for a few minutes.  When I awoke, they were not there.  I remember going into the bathroom, with only $14 in my pocket, wondering if I could get home on that amount of money.  I was alone, lonely, depressed and homesick.  I desperately wanted to call home, but was embarrassed to since I had not been gone a whole day yet.  By the time my flight rolled around at about 6:00 p.m., I was extremely sleepy and felt grungy.  I didn’t get to shower at the enlistment center, so I was a day and a half from soap and water.    It was a commercial flight and I was seated next to an Air Force guy.  He was moving from one duty station to another and was the first friendly voice I heard since my recruiter left.  He let me sit by the window even though I was supposed to have an isle seat.  We flew from Montgomery to the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta.  It was one of the largest and busiest airports in the country.  I had to change flights and airlines, which meant I had to go to another part of the airport.  But, I had another long layover to wait out before I left for Dallas/Fort Worth.  I managed to find the right terminal and was sitting out another 2-hour wait.  It was agonizing.  I felt so alone; I had never felt that way before.  I made it through the wait and the flight to Dallas/Fort Worth.  I didn’t have to change flights, but the plane waited there for 30 minutes before leaving for El Paso. Some of the guys I would be in basic training with boarded the flight in Dallas.  They had traveled from their respective enlistment sites and none of them befriended me right away.  I remember when we got to El Paso; we were expecting a ride to the base.  It was about midnight and we found the place we were supposed to be.  There was a staff sergeant waiting for arrivals of trainees for Ft. Bliss.  I remember him saying, “I wonder what I’m gonna do with all these knuckleheads.”  I thought, “knuckleheads, he doesn’t even know me.”  Was I ever in for an awakening.    There was a ride waiting for us.  We went to the base in a car with four doors on each side.  When we arrived at the reception station, we were subjected to a screaming and a search of our luggage.  They made each of us go into a room alone and were instructed to get rid of any “contraband” we had with us.  After they yelled at us some more, they trudged us to the supply room and we drew sheets for our bunks.  By the time they let us go to bed, it was 1:00 a.m.  I had been awake for most of the past 40 hours.  I was exhausted and slept hard for three hours until they woke us up.  At that point, I was in the army.  I was instructed by some of the people who were veterans of the reception station that we were to make our bunks and prepare for formation.  They had been there for all of two days.  I didn’t know the correct procedure for making a bunk to army standards and didn’t know exactly how to line up in formation.  After some getting yelled at, I managed to make it to the point where we were being marched to the place where we would get to eat.    It was still dark and I desperately wanted some sleep.  Those of us that had arrived in the past couple of day still did not have army uniforms.  The people at the mess hall whistled and jeered at us when we marched by.  We still had our long hair too that was popular in the mid 1980’s.  We didn’t know how to march and didn’t know the commands they gave while we did it.  We tried to follow the people who had been there for a couple of days that knew more than we did.    That day was a blur, consisting of yelling, intimidation and harassment of everything we did.  Those of us without uniforms and haircuts were made to feel self-conscious of those who did.  I believed once I got a uniform and a haircut, it would make it difficult for those who were whistling at us to tell how long we had been there.  That evening after chow, as the army called every meal, I was in the wrong place in the formation.  I was picked for a detail to clean a building nearby.  We worked on it until 10:00 p.m.  I thought we would never get it finished to satisfy the sergeants at the reception station.  I had had three hours sleep in the past three days and was exhausted beyond anything I had ever imagined.  It was past “lights out” when we got back to the barracks and I didn’t get to take a shower for the third straight day.  By the time I got to take a shower on the fourth day, my hair was so nasty, it would have broken off by itself.  It was fairly long, which was the style of the mid 1980’s.    We finally got haircuts, uniforms and were assigned to our basic training unit.  The one thing that made it somewhat bearable was we were all in the same boat.  Our main focus in life was to be successful of our tasks of the next eight weeks.  We had to learn a lot during the time to come; everything from how to lace our boots to the regulations on shaving.  We had to learn how to make our bunks and shine our boots.  There was a diagram in our wall lockers, the army’s answer to a closet, on how everything was to be laid out.  In the early days, we spent as much time as we had to get them correct.  But after the first four or five weeks, we noticed the drill sergeants never checked to be sure they were within specification.    By that point, we thought we knew what we had to do to stay out of trouble with the drill sergeants.  The barracks had to be spotless and our bunks made tight enough to bounce a quarter off of.  On the many occasions where we were not up to par, we heard the dreaded command of half left face or open ranks.  Either could be used to put the platoon in the army’s front leaning rest position.    I remember the day I was taught what the front leaning rest position was.  After we left the reception station for our unit, we had to wait for the platoons to fill up.  I got there on day 2 and the platoon was full on day 5.  In the meantime, we had to do mindless details such as pulling weeds and be harassed by the drill sergeants.  At one point, a drill sergeant was not happy with us and told us to bend forward at the waist.  He told us to blow out with our mouths shut.  Then he instructed us to yell “pop”.  He told us we had just blown our heads out of our asses.  Sometime in the same time frame, we were in formation when the drill sergeant told us he was going to teach us a new way to rest.  He told us to bend our knees and touch our hands to the ground.  Then he said we were to kick our legs back.  I was hoping for some rest when I realized I was in the push-up position.    Sometime during the first days in the army, we were told the trainees were to receive seven hours sleep per day.  So, our sleep hours were supposed to be between 8:30 and 3:30.  But, we never seemed to get that amount of time.  They usually didn’t release us to take showers until 9:00 or 9:30.  Then, we had to wait to get a shower and it was at least 10:00 or 10:30 when we got to sleep.  And, there was fire watch.  Someone had to pull an hour of fire watch every night, which took another hours sleep when it was our turn.  And, if we got the next to the first hour or the next to last, you basically lost two hours sleep.    About five or six weeks into basic training at about 8:00 p.m., the drill sergeants announced they were going to inspect wall lockers after the formation and before we went to bed.  They could sense by our reaction that something was wrong.  Finally, we had to admit we did not have them to the diagram.  By that time, when we got into trouble and were punished with push-ups or mountain climbers, we called it getting “dogged out”.  After our confession and a dogging out, we were told we had 10 minutes to get the wall lockers to specification.  That wasn’t even long enough to get everything out and folded properly to put in at the diagram specifications.  Needless to say, we got dogged out after the 10 minutes.  In cases like that, they would make us do push-ups until we thought our arms would fall off.  After they were satisfied we had had enough, they gave us another 10 minutes.  The result was the same.  We needed 10 minutes just to explain that it would take us 2 hours.  We got dogged out again and given 10 more minutes.  By that time, everyone had gotten punchy.  It had become amusing that we would be doing all the push-ups our arms would do in another 10 minutes.  Among ourselves, we decided when the drill sergeants were finished with us the next time that we would ask for more push-ups.  After the dogging, we did it as we planned, even though we didn’t know if we could actually do anymore.  I believe our thinking was that they would not make us and give us time to fix the wall lockers.  The drill sergeant was quite surprised when we asked for more push-ups.  He asked, “You want more push-ups?”    Everyone shouted, “Yes, drill sergeant.”  He put us at half left face and we did 20-25 more and he gave us an hour to get the wall lockers done.  Our ploy worked.  And, it gave the drill sergeant a rock that we asked for more push-ups.  By the time I finished my wall locker and got a shower, it was 11:30, and I would have to get up in four hours.  Some people were up for another hour before they were finished.

      John Thomson was embarrassed when he woke up with a moderate hangover that morning.  After the divorce, he swore to himself he would never let anyone see his true feelings again.  He had not seen the divorce coming.  Jennifer simply came home one day and said she was leaving him.  Although John was just over thirty years old, he was glad they had no children to hurt with the upheaval of a divorce.  Shortly afterwards, John found out that Jennifer had been seeing a well-to-do dentist in a nearby town who could give her much more than he could.    The first few months were the worst.  John did not know what to do with his time.  One evening, he realized he could no longer watch the walls caving in on him, so he set out on a walk.  Two hours later, when John arrived home, he was not only able to sleep, but the exertion somehow made him feel better.  The next evening after work, John took another walk with the same effect.  Before long, he began to look forward to the walk; it was his time.  No work, no stress, no Jennifer, no dentist, just walking and daydreaming about better times.  As time went on, John mixed a little running into his walking and before he knew it, he was running five miles a day several days a week.  The endorphins and getting into good physical condition after a few years’ layoff was just the therapy John needed.    John had always wanted to learn to play the acoustic guitar, and although he was a fan of many types of music, he loved country and rock ballads.  So, he signed up for guitar lessons.  John had plenty of time on his hands, so he practiced his guitar, sometimes for hours each night.  He was a quick learner and seemed to have a true knack for it.    John and his high school buddies had always liked college football, and John managed to get invited to the home of an old high school buddy one Saturday afternoon to watch the game.  They grilled burgers, drank a few beers and everyone had a good.  The weekend games became a ritual that fall, and John always looked forward to them.  Even though he always participated, he rarely drank more than a beer or two.  He wasn’t exactly the life of the party, but more of a wall flower that anyone hardly noticed.    John had been out of the dating scene for over ten years before the divorce.  Someone was constantly trying to fix him up with this girl or that, but John politely declined.  The women at the football parties tried to press the issue, but John cleverly waved them off without having to say he would not allow another woman to hurt him the way Jennifer had.    Monica was one of the high school buddies who attended almost every Saturday afternoon.  She was popular in high school and was still just as beautiful as she had ever been.  After her own divorce about a year ago, Monica had done some dating, but nothing serious.    John liked Monica as a person and he could sense that she was interested in him, but he was having none of it.  Sherry, the hostess of the football parties,  tried to coax John into asking her out, but to no avail.  He did, however, agree to accompany her to a social event where it was expected that each person bring a spouse or date.  Sherry told John that Monica didn’t have a date and asked if he would go as a friend so Monica would not feel out of place.    John went and it wasn’t anything like a date.  It was very plutonic and Monica was busy during much of the event, leaving John to talk to other acquaintances.  She was very appreciative to John for going, but he did not call her afterwards like she hoped he would.  One Saturday, John was feeling particularly down after he heard Jennifer had gotten married to the dentist.  Everyone was surprised when John pulled a third beer out of the cooler.  They were even more surprised when he took the fourth, fifth and sixth.  After the game was over and the grill had cooled off, everyone was gathered on the deck, laughing and joking.  Most were half loaded, including John.  Sherry brought out her son’s guitar, knowing that John had been taking lessons.    John had drank just enough courage to be coaxed into a song.  At first, several people was still talking and laughing when John started playing.  By the end of the first few lines of the sad country ballad, everyone was mesmerized.  They had all known John for many years, but none of them knew that he had such a beautiful singing voice.  After two more songs, John politely excused himself to the bathroom, slipped out of the house and went home without saying anything to anyone.  When Monica pulled into his driveway the next morning, John had gotten up early and was gone for a ten-mile run to get rid of the cobwebs in his head and to chastise himself for allowing his feelings to gush out so clearly in the music he played the night before.  He had broken his vow and had to get back to his resolve.

      Prior to the mid-1950’s, the country store was the hub of the community in rural America.  Although there are a few remnants speckled throughout the country, they are all but gone.    Back in the day, the country store was a very vital part of the community, both from a practical standpoint as well as the social aspects.  People in the rural areas didn’t travel long distances to buy the products they needed, but the store owner could order it for them.  It wasn’t practical for the local residents to travel since cars were much slower, the roads were not nearly as advanced and most importantly, their time was reserved for making a living out in the fields.    Socially, most of the community scuttlebutt and practically all the good gossip passed through the store.  The store owner was one of the first to know about a new baby or an upcoming marriage.  He knew who stayed out drinking on Saturday night and who had been in a fist fight.  And, more likely than not, the store doubled as a post office and had one of the few telephones in the area.    Nearly twenty years after the country store’s usefulness had all but disappeared, my grandfather used to take me to what was left of the one in his town.  The back of the store, which had once held fifty-pound sacks of flour, sugar and grain was practically empty.    As a little boy, the smell of old wood was queer to my nose as was the old style shelves that were quite different from those of a metal variety in the grocery store.  The unpainted boards that covered the floor were uneven and showed decades of age.  Curiously, the outside of the building, also made of old wood planks, was not painted.  Not hardly school age, I didn’t fully appreciate that I was seeing something that would soon fade into the lore of Americana.    Whereas the back of the store was once a bustle of activity, with the men of the community loading heavy sacks out of the big double doors onto wagons and trucks, it had been relegated to a gathering spot for the “old men” of the community to play dominoes.  The big double doors no longer served as a loading and unloading point, but just helped the breeze go all the way through the building, making it somewhat cooler.    I’m guessing that many of the old men were the same ones loading grain sacks decades earlier.  My grandfather, who was about fifty-two was lumped into the same age category with those much older.    The old man who ran the store was called Skeet, no doubt a nickname.  I never knew his real name, and to the best of my recollection, the sign out front read “Skeet’s Grocery.”  He appeared to be about the same age as my grandfather, but my grandfather had told me that Skeet was in his seventies.  He said Skeet had always owned the store and never had to “work hard” so his true age didn’t show.    I always loved to go play dominoes with my grandfather; it was our special time, and I cherish those memories to this day.  Sometimes, I just watched, but other times, I got to play.  Sometimes we would play teams of two against two of the other old men and occasionally I played one-on-one against one of the old men.  Most of them let me win, but I particularly remember one gruff old man who always beat me.  It hurt my feelings to lose, but he always extended a hand to shake after the game.  Sometimes, I had a lump in my throat from losing and his tight handshake grip didn’t help matters.  But, I always tried not to let my hurt feelings and dented pride show through.  Skeet’s store was torn down during the 80’s and sometime along the line Skeet passed away.  My grandparents moved from the town in the late 70’s.  My grandfather is gone now too, but I’ll always remember my time at Skeet’s store.    My own son is old enough to learn to play dominoes, and anytime we play, I am always transported back to my own time of innocence and enjoyment of something that would soon be gone for good.

      The Cummins diesel engine hummed along as it filled the air with its familiar smell. I hoped the engine’s front seal would hold out a while longer until I afford to have it fixed. It had been slightly leaking for a couple of weeks, which might continue for months or it could go out all at once.&nbsp;   I paused to wonder how I ended up hauling logs on a used tractor trailer after putting myself through college and working as an accountant for over a decade. It was almost amusing that I was happier sweating in the summer and freezing in the winter, wrestling a big steering wheel as opposed to pecking computer keys in a climate controlled office, wearing nice clothes and cologne. I took a deep breath, smelling the diesel fumes and said to myself, “yep, it’s great being my own boss. Well, except for the logging companies, my creditors, the Department of Transportation, and the damn truck itself.”  But, looking into the future, I had no plans of laying myself off like my ex-company and my ex-boss had. Having worked my first few years in a major metropolitan area, I finally got the chance to move back home to north central Tennessee. The factory was owned by a major conglomerate and it was one of the biggest employers in town. When things went sour, the plant laid off half of its one thousand employees, including yours truly.  It was decision time. Either move back to Memphis, Nashville, or Little Rock or try to find something closer to home. With my powers of deduction, I observed my surroundings and noticed the number of truck drivers around the area, both eighteen-wheelers and other delivery-type trucks. I saw milk trucks, ice trucks, part store trucks, tire store trucks and everything in between, all of which had to have drivers with Commercial Driver’s License (CDL’s).   Part of my layoff package included a small education fund and I decided to use mine with a local company who trained truck drivers. Part of the training included getting my CDL’s and learning to drive everything from the eighteen-wheeler on down. I certainly didn’t want to be an over-the-road driver and be away from home all the time, but I knew I could make decent money driving locally if I could just get a foot in the door.  After “graduation,” I had trouble actually finding a job – everyone wanted someone with experience, or so it seemed. My uncle Jim has been an over-the-road truck driver for many years. The combination of pills and beer deteriorated his health and he was having difficulty loading and unloading the cars he was hauling. Car-hauling was one of the better paying truck driving gigs, according to Jim.   Over the course of his career, Jim has seen the business explode in size and change the way the drivers operate. He said there were ten times the trucks on the road that there were a decade ago. Much of that may be a result of the increased regulations placed on the trucking industry by the Department of Transportation (DOT). In Jim’s heyday, truckers took pills so they could drive for days at a time, but the DOT now had strict requirements on the amount of hours a driver could drive per day. Part of the new regulations was keeping a strict logbook, detailing where they had been and how many hours they were on the road.   According to Jim, many large trucking companies such as Roadway and Southeast Freight Lines only allowed their drivers to drive ten hours a day and they spent the rest of their time blowing money in truck stops. Jim said they would only make $400 - $500 a week, while he made almost $1,000. The truck stop dwellers poured money in Poker machines, bought fat-laden meals and watched movies in the truck stop lounges. Meanwhile, Jim skirted the DOT regulations while getting paid more per mile than his freight-hauling brethren.   Computers have negatively impacted the poor truck driver trying to make a living. While most truckers got paid by the mile, many padded their pay by not driving the shortest, most direct routes. Part of this may have been because the load weighed too much and they had to dodge scales, and often the most direct route was difficult to maneuver a big rig into. So, many large trucking companies use a computer to generate the amount of miles they pay the truckers rather than the actual miles they drive. If a trucker is over loaded, he or she has to skirt the scales for free while running the risk of getting stopped by a cop with portable scales.  Jim was feeling particularly poor, so he offered to let me come along and help for half the money. We could cover more distance between us than he could by himself. At first, Jim had me driving at night on long lonely stretches of interstate where I was less likely to get myself into trouble. This was helping me because I had mouths to feed and it was giving me the experience I lacked.   Jim was able to give me many pointers that they missed during the school, such as tips on low bridges, turning around when you get lost and actually finding the best route to bring a big rig to drop and pick-up. Even though a computer might tell you that going down a one-way street in downtown Atlanta is the closest route, it might be suicide if you got a truck into a traffic predicament that you couldn’t get out of.   Looking at a big rig and thinking about backing its trailer into a tight location is intimidating, and I wondered if I’d ever be able to do it. But, for the most part, it is a process to be learned like most other things. Of course, some drivers are better than others. There was a certain amount of pride among truckers for being able to put a tractor trailer in places where motorists seemed to have difficulty putting a compact car.  I was surprised that being out on the open road without all the corporate politics had its own form of bent seductiveness. Running down the interstate at eighty miles an hour, sitting well above all the other vehicles, controlling many tons of rolling steel gave you a feeling of power like no other. I could see how people got both addicted to it and fed up with it. It was almost like having an extra-marital affair – getting to see parts of the country that you otherwise wouldn’t, but you felt guilty for missing baseball games and cheerleading practice.  Even though I was gone a lot, the $500 cash I got for Jim each week helped make ends meet at home. After a few trips, I was really getting the hang of the truck and loading and unloading the cars. Jim’s health took a turn for the worse and he asked me to make the next trip alone. I wasn’t able to get across country and back as quickly, but the $1,000 a week sure helped me get caught up on bills.   I filled in for him for about six weeks before he was able to come back in the capacity that we started in. This went on for a couple more months before Jim was ready to go by himself. During that time, I met many of the people Jim knew. I was surprised to find out that he ran into many of the same people along the way. The contacts helped me get some driving gigs and continue to make money. But, I sure missed my family and they me.  During my real education, I found out that a truck was used by a company for three to four years then sold for nearly nothing. A new Freightliner, one of the middle-of-the-road trucks cost about a hundred grand and sold after four years for about ten thousand. Once they had that many miles, many companies wouldn’t allow them to be used because they started to break down more often.   One of Jim’s old buddies drove his own log truck for timber companies around home. Like Jim, he had spent many years on the road and his health was not good. He decided to retire and had his trailer up for sale. The truck was worn out and not really worth buying. Wanting to get off the road before I was totally hooked, I bought the trailer and an four-year-old Peterbuilt truck. He slid me in with his contacts and the next thing I know I’m worrying about paying for a front seal for my truck. But, I get to be home every night with my family. The work is hindered by weather and it has all the worries of owning your own business, but I’m making my payments and not putting up with the cutthroat atmosphere of Corporate America. I guess that’s how you go from accountant to truck driver.

      Sunday afternoons in rural America was a time of rest and relaxation.  Most activities of the communities surrounded the local Baptist Church.  A big afternoon meal followed by the children playing in the yard and horseshoes by the adults were commonplace.  Others preferred a nap under a the big oak tree that gave great shade.  Chuck and Danny talked their parents into letting them go play at the hole in the rock.  Everyone living near the small community knew where you were talking about if you said ‘hole in the rock.’  Simply put, it was a hole in a rock.  The narrow dusty gravel road snaked down the side of the bluff, where part of the way down was an almost perfectly round hole in the rock wall.  It was about fifteen feet up and only accessible by a ladder.    It was a local hangout for teenagers and whoever wanted to find a good Saturday night drinking spot or a place to spark with that special girl.  People camped out and even got married at the famed hole in the rock.  Kids like Chuck and Danny went there to play whenever they could.  After goofing around for a while, Chuck and Danny got the not-so-good idea of venturing into town to see a movie.  At twelve years old, coming from parents who were farmers and didn’t have a lot of discretionary income, the boys never got to go to movies.  Taking in a movie on Sunday was quite frowned upon by the Baptist Church.  Even worse, the town of Brighton was a seven or eight mile walk.  It is somewhat surprising that Chuck and Danny even had the quarter needed to enter the movie theatre in 1950.  But, both boys had hired their services out to other farmers when the opportunity arose.    Brighton was the county seat boasting five thousand people, and even more impressive, two movie houses.  After making one bad decision that would certainly land them in more trouble than they could get out of, the boys decided to go for two.  When the first movie let out, the boys walked the two blocks to the other movie theatre to see a second show.    They were scared when they walked out of the second movie and it was pitch black dark outside.  It was sacrilege in farm country to miss supper, which Chuck and Danny had already done.  Even worse, they had a seven or eight mile hike ahead of them on a dark lonely country road.  But, with youth comes eternal hope.  During that era, the boys knew if they saw a car going in their direction, their chances of getting a ride was pretty good.  This would shorten their journey by two hours, whereby they could make a series of excuses about letting time slip away and only get in minor major trouble.  Luck was not on their side.  The only vehicle they saw after an hour of walking and quite a bit of running was coming toward them.  To make matters worse, Chuck and Danny recognized the truck as that of Chuck’s father.  Chuck’s father had never spanked him before, and he never did again afterwards, but going to the movies on SUNDAY, without permission, not to mention scaring the life out of their parents, a fair spanking was in order.  Over fifty years have passed and those in Chuck’s family that remember that episode still get a laugh out of it.  Chuck doesn’t get much of a laugh out of it, but will grudgingly give a detail or two about it when pressed.
