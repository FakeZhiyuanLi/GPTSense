      Ok, obligatory ' Labyrinth ' movie line. ;) Final in attendance count:  Brad, Jason, Stephy, Katy, Damien, Ricky, my brownies  (that lasted maybe 3 hours at the most at the party), and  I . :D   Last night I attended the Charmer get together at  urlLink Brad's house of Asskickery  . It was alot of fun. Brad came by to pick Katy and I up around 5:45, and we headed to Neil's to pick up Damien. We knocked, well Brad did, and upon receiving no answer, we proceeded through Sabraton towards Brad's apartment. Damien called Brad's cell on route through Sabraton, so we called Ricky (who was already at Brad's waiting to be let in) to go back to Neil's to pick up Damien. Rick was a good sport and agreed. So, we proceeded to our destination. Upon entering the House of Asskickery, we proceeded to play video console games. Marvel vs. Capcom, which I kicked some ass. A little while later we were joined by Ricky and Damien. We proceeded to play some racing games. That Ford sports  car  I used last round was horrible. The handling sucked. I managed to pull into first at one point with my little Mini Cooper, but was left in the dust by Damien (1st) and Katy (2nd). Ricky pulled in at 4. I managed to bang up my Silver Volkswagon Beetle in one round. The car had no headlights, and 1 missing tail light by the end of the 3rd lap on the rainy streets of the Washington, DC metropolis track. *laugh* Good thing I'm not as wreckless in real life when it comes to being behind the wheel. ;)   After that we played another fighting game, in which when you died your soul turned into a pink glowing heart shaped balloon and people could grab it and then you'd remain an 'ankle biter' and just really annoy those who still had souls. MWHAHAHAHAHA   Once everyone had gotten their violent aggressions out of the way, we proceeded to the movie screening of "Labyrinth". That movie, still as good even almost 24(?) years later.   They played the fighting/stealing soul game again while Stephy, Rick and I paruesed Brad's gaming collection looking for our next conquest. We had it narrowed down to Karaoke Revolution and another 4 player Racing game. In the end, Karaoke won the vote. We popped it in, and chose our order. I had seen the game played before (reference, Christmas down at Eddie's dad's) but I had never played. I love singing karaoke at the top of my lungs to Top 40 songs, Jewel, some underground stuff and showtunes like RENT and Chicago, Disney songs, etc. in the privacy of my own room. I had never sang in front of anyone before really, so I was nervous and more than a little petrified by time my turn came along. I was 6th to go, out of 6. Ricky was a party pooper and didn't sing at all. The rest of us did, and after the first few, everyone started loosening up and really getting into it. We had it set on random pick for our 3 song in our competitions.   My first turn came, and like I said..I love doing karaoke in the privacy of my own room, so I was petrified, but I gave it my best. My score reached platinum first go around with over 45000 points on a Michelle Branch's song, I can't remember which one it was..damnit. Either "All You Wanted", or "Everywhere". I kicked the shit out of that song, despite being super nervous (1st place out of 6 in the competition). Next was Avril's "Complicated", I scored second out of 6 on that one. Third song, I idn't know at all and had to wing it. I knew the chorus, not the entire song. I came in 3rd, "Son of a Preacher". Over all, first go around. I took second place. After the first round competition we headed to Eat N Park. We were practicing kicking ass Tae Kwon Do moves in the front lobby while waiting for the Host to seat us. After food was ordered and eaten, it was back to the house of Asskickery. Now it was 3am. We watched a few episodes on Brad's computer (while he burned me a picture cd of all the Charmer photo's thus far, Thanks again Brad! :D )of Red vs. Blue.. or something like that. Then it was return to karaoke competition. I was tired, and my heart wasn't as in it as the first go around. And the judging went to Medium level. I chose "Complicated" as first choice, "The One That I Want" from Grease (took Platinum on that one), and my final choice I had promised to Damien and did J Lo's "Waiting for Tonight". I will do Karaoke Revolution again, second competition was disappointing for me. This time I'll be more awake and more into it. I think that will help it alot.   Finally ended the competition as the sun was coming up after 6 am. Finally got to sleep around 8am. I have a rehersal for Magic Bell, then I have to load the van, pack and get ready for my tour to Snowshoe this weekend. Wish me luck. Last night was fun guys. But then again, we always manage to have fun. ;) This summer has been one of the most busy and most fun..that I can ever remember. That's wonderful. :D   I gotta run now, update when I get back from Snowshoe probably. I love you guys. :D   Love Always,   L  i  v  i  a   R  o  s  e    @    ^)^

      This weekend was  insane ! Seriously!   Friday night everyone met for an evening at Garfield's restaurant. First, we stopped by Hot Topic while waiting for everyone to show up. In attendance:  Drew, Brad, Katy, Taher, Jordan, Dan, Rick, Stephy  and  I . Full house. Awesome. :D We joked around, ordered food, Katy got some kick ass voicemail greetings ( urlLink  Drew voicemail  &  urlLink Dan's vulgar one  ), she should record them and post them for all to hear. Dan's vulgar one is hilarious! :D Chocolatey-goodness was ordered, and then attacked by Drew and Katy. They put up a good fight...but sadly were unable to conquer. Piggy-back rides ensued. Drew was the only one willing to be taken on by me (hense the subject line quote). I won't break people. :p Afterwards, Drew openned up his car's trunk and blasted some tunes. Everyone attempted to break dance it down charmer style (Pic's posted below). Then it was onward to the Mountainlair plaza! We took over U92 on Doug's shift, and while the rest of the charmers engaged in top secret missions, I hopped over to the 'Corner Cafe' after being invited by Robin earlier that day. I got there around 1 am. Chilled with Robin *she made me two iced espressos and I was wired!*, Klara and Pam. Everyone else had left. :( But I had fun chillin with my sisters. :D Afterwards, I got a ride from Jordan and I was introduced to Damien. They were headed to Trudy's party. So, I got home around 2:30 in the morning. I was still wired from the freakin espresso damnit! So I watched some of Season Six of Sex and the City, until my cell rang at a little after 4. Drew was planning on heading back to Pittsburgh dead tired with a headache. That just wouldn't do, so I hopped online and got him a complimentary night on the futon of Brad's at his House of Asskickery. I felt much better, I would've been worried if he would've gone back to PA. Thank you Brad! :D   Next day, went and ran some errands. Bought two size 5 mini skirts for 10$ each at Elder Beerman on sale. Sweet! :D Came home, did some things, got ready for the Fake Eddie concert at Liquid Lounge @ 9:30. Called Robin to let her know about the concert and if she was downtown and interested, told her to stop by. :D Finally got a chance to hop online about 5 minutes till Rick was supposed to be at our door. Got IMed from Eddie who I hadn't heard from in forever and a day, sorry I had to run, you caught me at a really bad time! In attendance:  Neil, Ricky, Morgan, Katy  and  I . So we were chillin, waiting for everyone else to show up. 10:30 rolls around and we decide to walk up to the Den so Morgan can get some smokes. On our way up we run into Taher, who wasn't paying any attention in his car. He left us in the dust for another party. :P Up to the Den and back again. We are later joined by Brad. I see Klara and Robin inside and talk to them for a bit, then they wanted me to head to Elements with them. Sorry, I was already with the charmer's. So I made plans to chill with them in the future. We are then joined by Dan and Jordan. And later Nicole and Matt her fiance. :D We stayed for 4 Fake Eddie songs, Liquid Lounge was crowed and hot. Everyone was hungry, so we headed to Eat N Park for some food. Many jokes and laughs later at EnP, Katy treated everyone (thanks Katy! :D), we head back to Dan's to party and chill. So much fun. Seriously. Many pictures were taken, they were fucking hot, some hilarious, most fucking awesome! I stayed at Dan's until 7 this morning, then went back to Brad's for about an hour, I got to see all the pictures from our past few gatherings, and I am promised a burned picture cd at Tuesday's showing of Labrynth. :D Awesome! But many thanks go to Brad and Dan for last night. Seriously, thank you both. :D   I'm really kinda tired though, I hope that was a pretty accurate run down of the past two nights of Charmer social events. I hope it makes sense to all who happen to read, and hopefully pictures will be posted so you can see how awesome we are. ;D  urlLink Pictures posted! WARNING: ADULT CONTENT! Hot pics & hilarious antics! Consider yourself warned. ;)    Love Always,   Livia Rose    @    ^)^     Breaking it down Charmer style.       Freak out baby!      &nbsp;      Close up of Jordan, Dan and I           Jordan and I groovin'           Katy gives it to Jordan.&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; Looks like it hurts!
