        Here we go...      Mom came back from New York and things are already starting to get moderatly stressfull. She's always telling Dad when he stresses out, which he does do, to stop it. But I'm not sure if she realizes that she too "stresses out" as they put it...      Sometimes when they bicker I'd rather be anywhere but in this house. I'm one of those people who when two people or a group of people that I I know fight I get all upset and will eventually start crying.      Sometimes Mom and Dad's arguments get so out of hand, I'd rather run Nutty-pants (naked) through the street! Wow.. how random was that???               Sometimes when I think about "the bloddy bloke who will remain nameless" I want to call him up a say ,"I'm sorry!! I'm so sorry!!! Whatever I did please forgive me and take me back!!!!"      I know that's afully despret but (and I know this sounds WAY over dramatic but...) I feel almost LOST without him telling me I'm beautiful and that he loves me, and he wil always love me....               About the new kid on the brain:     I don't know a lot about him seeing as we've only really met once.... haha... oh good Lord I'm despret.............................................     But: anywho- he seemed really sweet not to mention he's pretty darn GORGEOUS! I could definatly see myself with him..... It was soooo funny b/c when we say the movie The Village the "monster's" were so scary! But I guess he didn't see them as scary b/c he leans over to me and says,"They look like mutant turkeys!!!!!" hahahahaha!!!! made me laugh out loud (untill the people behind me told me to shut up and kicked the back of my seat.... *cough*cough*)!!!!!!!!!!!      all 4 now

       Since the "break up" with "the bloody bloke whom will remain nameless"... for some odd reson I haven't been able to think of hardly anything else! Well you couldn't really call it a break up... it was more of let's force my bestfriend, who's girlfriend, by the bloody way, broke up with him the same way, to break up with the girl I claim to love, for me! I mean honestly man! How daft can you get? But even though he was horrible about the break up, and hasn't called since then to apollogize or somethin', I can't stop thinking about all the time that was spent with him... Oh Lord in Heaven, help me, I still have feelings for the boy who broke my heart in a million pieces and then stepped on it (and burned it in the burning fires of hell, and shot it down with a bebe, and ran over it with a Monster Truck, and killed it like a kid standding over an ant hill with a magnifying glass, and i guess you get the picture........ ) .       It's been bloody boring the last couple of days... bloody hell! Summer's almost gone! Then I'll have to go back to "the jail cell". Mom says that if I don't get a's and b's the whole entire year she's gonna ship me off to some privet school... ughh... sometimes she is so unethical!! Sometimes it's as if she WANTS to ruin my life...   Well enough complaining.......   On the upside of my life:   - I kinda like this one kid: He's the son of a guy who works for dad. I went to the movies with him and his little brother to see The Village (pretty bloody scary btw) and he's mega cute. AND he's spanish... ahhhhh!! idk... i have this thing 4 guys who can speek spanish fluently... idk its kinda hot when they do lol! well yea........... im gonna go more later when when i get restless and need some thots outty!!      Love always.......   ShortLexa
