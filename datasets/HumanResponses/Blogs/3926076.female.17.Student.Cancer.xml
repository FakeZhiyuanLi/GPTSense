      Jay and I went out to Kreckle’s and ended up going out to the broken bridge! He didn’t seem like he liked it at first, but the most we walked around, the more fascinated he seemed. He took lots of fun pictures. We didn’t stay back there all that long cuz the bugs were eating me alive.   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     After that, we came back and donked around at my house so I could show him pictures of my week with Doug and such and so we could get caught up since it’d be over two weeks since we’d seen one another. Later, we headed over to his house so I could drop him off. I really wanted to see Gretchen and Marty. They weren’t there when I got there, but by 8:30 they had both gotten home from work. I was so glad to see them. And they were glad to see me. I had originally only meant to go over there for a few minutes and it ended up being over an hour and a half. Oops!   =) Lydia

      Well, here I am. I’ve been working on the massive “summary” of our week on and off all day. It’s been pretty quiet all day here. Miranda left for horse camp first thing this morning. I picked her up at 3:15 and took her and her friend Abby over to dance. Kyle had his friend over. He was pretty darned annoying… but not really a bad kid. He didn’t want to help pick up Life after we played and kept like throwing little rubber balls at me and such. He didn’t really do much that could hurt me badly or anything… it was just way obnoxious. Kyle kept standing up for me, though. And that was way cute.   I went to Lincoln yesterday with Leese. Then she came over to “mah crib” and we had a spaghetti picnic and went down to the broken bridge! We took some cute pictures… but I look like a boy cuz I had a big tee on and my hair back in a braid. So we have plans to get somewhat cuter and go back down there tomorrow and get more fun pictures.     urlLink     urlLink       urlLink     urlLink      Jay just called a few minutes ago to see if I’m up for a Kreckle’s run. Yum yum! Of course I’m up for Kreckle’s! How could I not be? And I WAY ready to see jay. It’s been over two weeks since I saw him last. Darn that  urlLink Spoke Folk  stealing him and Gretchen way.   Well, I’ll be wrapping it up so I can continue writing my entry over the week with Doug!   =) Lyd

       When I get older losing my hair  Many years from now  Will you still be sending me a valentine,  Birthday greetings, bottle of wine   If I'd been out till quarter to three  Would you lock the door  Will you still need me, will you still feed me  When I'm sixty-four   You'll be older too  And if you say the word  I could stay with you       I could be handy, mending a fuse  When your lights have gone  You can knit a sweater by the fireside  Sunday mornings go for a ride  Doing the garden, digging the weeds  Who could ask for more  Will you still need me, will you still feed me  When I'm sixty-four   Every summer we can rent a cottage  In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear  We shall scrimp and save  Grandchildren on your knee  Vera Chuck & Dave   Send me a postcard, drop me a line  Stating point of view  Indicate precisely what you mean to say  Yours sincerely, wasting away  Give me your answer, fill in a form  Mine for evermore  Will you still need me, will you still feed me  When I'm sixty-four

      i fell in love with The Perks of Being a Wallflower all over again. i picked up so much more this time, too. so many more details. i rushed it last time. i read it for the basic plotline. and missed so many things. it was so much better this time.   "And in that moment, I swear we were infinite"

      we had an awesome storm a few hours ago. only bummer is, i was supposed to be going over to amber's for a cookout/swimming! but it was gorgeous. like you'd hear on a cd. and then it made the power go out for two hours. so when i wanted to go out, i had to manually open the garage door!   it's weird when the power finally kicks back on. the majority of the electrical items just pick up right where they left off. lights turn back on, the dish washer and washing machine kick back on, the tv, everything. they don't even act like there was ever a problem. it was weird to walk downstairs when my parents werent home. i thought they were. the computer light was on at mom's desk. and the stove top light. and the family room lights and TV. and everything. it's odd. it really is.

      yeah. shopping yesterday. sucked. a lot. really. and now, my legs hurt. a lot. *nod* we walked around  that  much. i suppose you could argue that maybe i'm out of shape, and that even a small amount of walking could make my muscles hurt. ...and with that, i would have to agree.   i'm finally straightening my hair. and realizing just how much karen really chopped off on friday. i'd been wearing it curly since then so i wouldn't have to find out. well, it's not good. at this rate, i'll never get anywhere near donating for locks of love. and gosh, i've only been trying since i was 13. i'm now 17. do the math. in addition, i decided way back when, that i wanted to wait to chop it all off until i went away to college. well, now things are looking like i won't be actually "going away" to college until i'm 19. not 18, as planned. my parents are a bit hesitant to send me out of state to college, but i won't have it any other way. so, it seems we're making a bit of an unofficial compromise. i go to Lincoln Land Community College (where my dad teaches part time, therefore, i get free classes) for a year, and get my free classes, and probably get some of my gen. ed. classes out of the way, and maybe continue with a couple... or three... of my languages. that seems to be the unspoken deal. hopefully it works out. wow. that was tangenting at its best. and didn't deserve to be one large paragraph. but ive never been good at the whole paragraph thing anyway. i really should learn not to post right after i wake up. yes, yes, oh, yay.   my computer is making a really odd, annoying, buzzing, weird, crap noise. doug and i tried to figure out what was causing it and i lost a chunk of my finger. mmm.

      Well, I suppose I should update. We’ll make it somewhat short and start with Sunday. I’ve started this entry four times. And I started it on Tuesday. It’s now Thursday. I’m a bum. Anyway..        Sunday, July 4, 2004      This was probably one of the worst fourth of Julys for me, ever. Things went okay in the morning, but by evening, meh.       I got to sleep in until 8:00ish. Then we headed off to Grandma’s for breakfast. My grandpa makes the best pancakes. Yum. In fact, he makes yummy everything. So we finished up there around 10:30 and headed off to church. We went to church in Beardstown (about an hour away) because they have a high Hispanic population there and offer a mass completely in Spanish! And with me being catholic and having a massive obsession with Spanish, that was insanely exciting.     We got there 25 minutes early because we had allowed time for getting lost and any other delays since we weren’t positive where we were going. The church was completely empty except for the woman making her way up to the altar on her knees like people often do in Mexico City at the Cathedral. My parents must have thought she was nuts but I briefly explained that it’s not insanely abnormal. So, we’ve been sitting there for twenty minutes, it’s now five minutes till mass starts, and there are only about 6 other people there. It was insanely empty. I couldn’t figure out why they’d even offer a mass in Spanish if there was such a low turn out. So, now it’s noon, and time for church to start. And a few more families have shown up, but it’s still almost completely empty. And within the next five minutes, the church was filled and there were at least twenty some people standing in the back, as well. It was insane. So mass starts, and the priest is speaking in English. Turns out, he was standing in for the usual priest. Just my luck. We drive an hour and he speaks English. If I wanted that I could have driving the 4 minutes to Riverton. In short, mass turned out to be very interesting. The priest led everything in English and then they’d all be saying stuff in Spanish. It was a mess.     On top of that, my family and I felt a bit out of place. We were the only non-Hispanic family there. We knew that we would be, but it was still weird. Some of them looked at us like they didn’t want us there, but others were very welcoming. So, I intend to go back on Sunday. I think once they kinda get to know me, they’ll think it’s neat. I’m just so insanely interested in their culture, and on top of that, working on my speaking and listening skills. I had read just fine. I can write pretty well. But when it comes to listening, it’s different. I have no problem listening to Senora, but my gosh, the people at church spoke so quickly! I’d really like to get used to listening at a fast pace.     So, following church, we went by dad’s friend, Leslie’s house to meet her. She was about to leave for an ice cream social and invited us to come along. So we went. It was at this new park they had just finished. It was really nice. The grass was all pretty and they had just put up a boardwalk by the river, and there was a barbershop quartet of women singing. It was pretty neat. Just super duper hot. Well, the quartet came over to sing near our table and Leslie had to embarrass me and tell them that I sing. So then they were trying to talk me into joining this group in Springfield. Not likely. So then, one started to tell me about a barbershop festival in October. Turns out it was the one we went to with Mrs. Finley last year. And it also turned out, she was the one that led my section. Odd.     Well, we had planned on watching a raft race on the boardwalk, but mom and I ended up being big babies and whining that it was too hot out. So we started to head home, but on the way made a stop at a Hispanic grocery store! I didn’t get much. Just a magazine, newspaper, and some Jarritos (this amazing Mexican drink that Wal*Mart stopped carrying).     So, that was about the extent of my excitement for the day. I did practically nothing to celebrate the Fourth. I went to Sam’s with M & D, but that was about it. I sat on the roof, alone, to watch fireworks, but by the time they started, I was being eaten alive by mosquitoes and have 7 or 8 bites already. So I called it quits and moped around feeling lonely. Whenever everyone left Doug’s he called me and cheered me right up, though!        Monday, July 5, 2004      Monday, we didn’t do anything too exciting, as far as I can remember. We went over to Jim and Charla’s for a Fourth party. We ended up playing cards with Charla’s Grandma, Mom, and Stepdad (I think) for like, an hour. It was fun though. A game called Fruit Salad.     I drove separately so that I could go get myself some summer clothes after the party. I DESPISE shopping, but somehow, was in a shopping mood. (Plus, I need a new one piece). It was quite odd. So, I went over to Old Navy, Gordman’s, and Sportsmart. The last two had one pieces, but none under like... the size of 8... and I need a 2 or so? So that worked out well. I got a beach mat and a new purse at old navy though! Then, I headed out to the mall where I spent another two or so hours. Bought lots of stuff, and everything was on sale! If I had gotten everything at its original price, it would have been $140. I got everything for $73.74! Six shirts, a purse, and a beach mat! I’d say I did pretty well!     I think that’s all I did on Monday. *shrug.* I really need to write daily. Oh! I had an appointment in the morning! I knew I did something else! Nothing exciting happened.        Tuesday, July 6, 2004      Back to babysitting. But Tuesday was fun! They got a new kitty and she is absolutely adorable! Her name is Star. The kids were both asleep when I got there… the kitty kept me company. We ended up taking a nap on the couch together for like, a half an hour. She’s too cute.      urlLink        I almost got roped into picking up Miranda and her friends from the mall. She and three other girls wanted to go out and shop. I drive a Taurus. It comfortably seats 4, but it’s possible to seat six. And that’s what we would have been doing. Driving four twelve year olds, Kyle, and me. Not good. Luckily, it fell through.     So, we just kind of hung out all day and played with the kitty. Kyle and I had planned to go to ice deli, but then a friend came over and asked if Kyle would come out and play. And then Kyle forgot about his plans with me. Amanda picked up Miranda at three and then the boys came back home and I watched them swim with the kitten in my lap. It was exciting. No… not at all. Also, I turned my application in at Sam’s Too, a nearby pizza place that the entire population at Williamsville and Sherman works at and I’ve been eating/visiting there several times a week! So after I visit Doug, chances are, I’ll be starting there.     Hm... other than that, nothing too exciting happened Tuesday either. Doug kept me up on the phone really late though! That silly Douggie.        Wednesday, July 7, 2004      Both the kids were asleep when I got there again. Theresa asked if I’d be able to dog/cat sit while over the weekend or so while they were gone to New Orleans(which Kyle keeps calling Los Angeles and Miranda thought was in Pennsylvania). So now I’m doing that. Otherwise, nothing exciting happened. We ate at pizza hut for lunch. Their breadsticks are amazing. The waiter remembered us from last time. He’s a really nice guy. Miranda and I laid out and she put lemon juice in her hair. Every four minutes, she asked if her hair was blonder and if she was tanner. And Kyle was out there with us coloring. But he stormed off cuz he got his picture wet. Like it was our fault. Eh. That sums things up.     Oh! But I did download Firefox! It’s a wonderful little browser than RC introduced me to. And I recommend it. Lots.     I treated my mommy to dinner. Originally, we were going to cracker barrel, but ended up deciding right before the exit to go to cheddars. ‘Twas yummy. Someday I’ll be able to eat everything on my plate.     Um… what else? Oh. Grandma broke both of her legs. Yay. And is probably going to a nursing home. Even bigger yay.        Thursday, July 8, 2004      Today Doug called me a little after 8 on my cell phone. And asked why I wasn’t babysitting. He knew for almost two weeks why I wouldn’t be there. What a silly head. I went back to sleep though. And it was nice to hear a good morning from him. It’s less than a month til I head off to the good ol’ PA. Yeahhhh, Wawa and Genuardis!     I’m way excited about my trip. Not only do I get to see my Doug, but we’re staying in NYC for two days (hopefully with Jaclyn [who finished her zine! Yaaayyy!] or I may die!), possibly beach-ing with Jaclyn, as well. Plus, I’m really excited about hanging out with Brittany and Courtney. It’ll be nice to have some female friends to make me less of a nervous wreck while I’m there! Not quite sure why I’m so intimidated by his parents. Oh, and what’s even better… I’m roast marshmallows with none other than the Ryan Clemens! Woo! He doesn’t know it yet, but we might camp out in their back yard as well! AND Doug is planning a pool party while I’m there. It’s bound to be a good time. Hopefully not as busy as his week here!     So, I’ve not done much today. I went to ice deli and that’s about it. I just wasn’t feeling very productive today… but tomorrow’s another day. Hopefully I’ll get back into the habit of posting daily!        <3 Lydia

      Finally getting around to writing about the whole week Doug was here! We attempted to outline things as the week went along. It’s a five page typed outline, but here we go! Hover over the pictures for a caption and click on it for the full size image.    Saturday, June 19, 2004   Note: See previous entry for events prior to leaving for Saint Louis the second time.   Well, I drove in Saint Louis for the first time. It wasn’t really all that bad. (Other than the fact that it’s six lanes at times.) A lot of times, the right lanes would just kind of turn into exits. And with all the traffic it was hard to get over at times. The signs must not have been the same as they are around here, cuz you’d think I would have noticed it turning into an exit if it had been in the place I’m used to. It was interesting.   Anyway, an hour and forty minutes and two stiff legs later, we got into Springfield ahead of time and went to Best Buy to pick out a  urlLink camera  under the guidance of Doug. We ended up getting me an Olympus Stylus 300 All Weather Digital. I like it a lot. It’s nice to not have share with my parents. You’ll see the fruits of my new camera throughout the entry.   Following our Best Buy outing, my family, Doug and I headed out to Rochester to go to church and to see Rachel sing.    urlLink      (Doug was glad to know that Rachel hasn’t changed a bit and is still ugly!) I don’t usually go to  urlLink RCC  on Saturday nights, but we had my birthday lunch planned for 11:00 at Grandma’s on Sunday, and I usually go to the 10:45 services. I was disappointed that we wouldn’t be able to make it to church on Sunday to visit with Senora, but it turns out that she was also going to be busy on Sunday and came to the Saturday night service too!   So we got to visit with her. I told her about Mrs. Finley resigning. She had no idea. Somehow I thought that teachers know all. Apparently not. She brought up the idea of Miss Vost. I hadn’t thought of her, but she definitely made things look a lot more promising. Miss Vost would be an excellent replacement. She may not be Mrs. Finley but I’m sure she could do an excellent job. Senora also told me she changed around the final test over the painters according to one of my suggestions. Doug was apparently quite impressed by this.   Following church, we went to Sam’s to visit Lisa and eat some dinner. I had a half order of cheese ravioli with marinara sauce and Doug had some kind of pizza bread or something. I had fun visiting with Leese and Doug got to meet her mom.    urlLink        We had then planned on going to the drive-in with my parents but ended up postponing it because Doug and I both got very little sleep and were exhausted by the time. So we ended up just going back to my house and hanging out.   Our “hanging out” involved very little activity. Doug played some new songs he had learned and sang and such. And then he gave me my birthday presents early. (He was as anxious as I was!) My favorite was definitely the card.   urlLink     I LOVED it! He spent three or four hours making it and it shows. In addition to the amazing card, I got a $15 gift card for Wawa. Yaaaay! I also got some favor coupons from Doug such as one free massage, one free ice deli, one free shipment of any Wawa product, one free chore around the Rusciolelli House, etc.! I got Gummi Bears, a t-shirt from one of my favorite games off of orisinal.com, a Care Bears poster, Green Tea bath things from Doug’s parents (which smells awesome!), and a fan for the computer that Doug forgot the power adapter for! Way fun! He had told me he could only afford one present and then had like nine hundred of them! I was really surprised.  We finished up our day by renting Love, Actually. It didn’t really hold our attention and there was quite a bit of profanity, so we ended up just talking and not watching it at all, then conking out and going to bed!    Sunday, June 20, 2004   Doug and I got up nice and early and went to church with my parents at St. Joe’s Catholic Church. There was a baptism so church took a bit longer than it usually does. We headed straight to my Grandparents’ following church.   When we got to my grandparents’ house my grandpa had already made the dumplings we had gone over there to make. We socialized for a half an hour or forty-five minutes or so, then went home for like, a half an hour before returning to my grandparents’ house for lunch. The food was super yummy as was the cake.    urlLink     My grandparents were kinda disappointed that Rachel didn’t come for lunch, but she did stop by to say hello before she went to see her family. Gina left at 11:40 cuz she had to work at noon (where she is now night manager!) After we ate cake and all at Grandma’s we headed over to Lisa’s to diagnose her computer. (I think it has Tuberculosis. It keeps coughing up some really odd error messages. …That was lame.) We ended up spending most of our time just chatting with Lisa with our feet in the pool. Lisa had to leave for camp so we couldn’t stay too long.   Doug and I went over to Wal*Mart to pick up flowers, mulch, and a bench for my Dad’s Father’s Day present. (Yes, it was late but I needed Doug’s help to do it.) My plan was to redo a garden that has been neglected the past few years and has been taken over by weeds.    urlLink     The first Wal*Mart run, we got the majority of the flowers, some mulch, and a bench at a grand total of $150.   As we were about to pull out of the parking lot, Doug heard someone calling his name. Turns out, it was Amber! She had just gotten off work at Schnuks and was trying to change in the parking lot. It was interesting. Doug describes it as “She wore a toga.” I describe it with a picture.     urlLink       After talking to Amber in the parking lot for some twenty minutes of so, we went home to drop the flowers off and hide them in the garden while my parents were still out.   THEN, we hit ice deli! Unfortunately, it was pretty icky and raining outside so we ate or ice deli in my car and when Doug finished we played guitar and sang. It was lots of fun. The rest of the day, as far as I remember, we just lounged around!    Monday, June 21, 2004   Monday was my seventeenth birthday. I started it out pretty pessimistically. I was bummed cuz it seemed like everyone was out of town. Lisa, Kate, Gretchen, and Jay. And to top it all off, we had a board meeting at 7:00 (or as Doug called it… a “bored meeting”) regarding the resignation of Mrs. Finley.   Well, we slept in somewhat late because I didn’t have to babysit the kids. It worked out nicely that I don’t babysit on Mondays! We went to ice deli to eat (obviously) and to play guitar/sing. Unfortunately, after only one song, the G string broke. Bummer! A lady that heard us sing the song said we sang really well though!   So, we decided to go by Strings ‘N’ Things and the bank before we went to dinner. I went to the bank to find out I was $86 overdrawn! I hadn’t overdrawn very much, but apparently they charge you some kind of fee the longer you’re overdrawn, which is somewhat sneaky if you ask me! So I went to cash $225 worth of checks and he reminded me I had a negative balance. I told him to deposit what I needed. (But then later in the week got a thing saying that I’m now like, $17 overdrawn. And I haven’t used my checking account for over a week, so that’s a bit odd.) Strings ‘N’ Things was interesting. Quite a bit trashier than I thought it would be. And also a bit pricier. I got strings for $15 and Doug bought me a capo for $18. That’s expensive if you ask me.   We went to Cheddar’s for my birthday dinner.    urlLink     urlLink     However, we were both already pretty full from having ice deli. But, having eyes bigger than our tummies, we decided we wanted either mozzarella sticks or honey butter croissants. We couldn’t decide between the two on our own so we ended up asking our waitress’s opinion and getting the mozzarella sticks. They were excellent! However, by the time we ate the appetizer, We couldn’t even eat half of our meal. And to top it all off, Doug secretly told the waitress that it was my birthday and we got a free dessert!    urlLink      Well, we figured it wasn’t too big of a deal that we hardly ate any of our meal and that we’d just get a few To-Go boxes. We did so and put all our leftovers in the boxes. Then, left them on the table when we left. Duh!   On the way home from Cheddar’s, we were at the intersection where you can go left to head towards my house or right to go towards Camp Butler National Cemetery and through Riverton. Well, Doug and I decided to go check out the graves of my great grandfather, Paris, and his wife, Lydia, who I'm named after.    urlLink      I tried to use this grave finder thing and print out a little map of the cemetery, simply because I think it’s neat, but the printer was out of paper. While we were there, I also scoped out the bathrooms; they were very clean for being semi-outdoors! I was impressed! Much cleaner than most department store restrooms!    After visiting the cemetery for a bit, we headed home to pick Mom up and go to the board meeting up at the district office. We sat there for an hour and a half and very little of it pertained to the purpose of our being there. However, we did find out who got hired for Mrs. Finley’s position. Her name is Lisa Vost and by the time school begins, she’ll be Lisa Bosworth. (She’s marrying Chuck from the a capella group  urlLink Chapter Six !) In addition, she was taught by Mrs. Finley in high school and student taught under her my eighth grade year.   We left the board meeting at 8:30 and rushed to get to ice deli before it closed. However, while tuning another string broke (not Doug’s fault) and I threw a temper tantrum. I don’t have the faintest idea why I threw such a fit, but I pulled back out of the parking lot and didn’t even get ice deli. What a crab!    Tuesday, June 22, 2004    Tuesday was our first day over at the Freeman’s. Miranda was supposed to be going to dance camp the entire week that Doug was around. However, Miranda wanted to be able to hang out with Doug and she dances every night of the week, so she and her parents decided against going to camp. So, since she cancelled her plans to go to camp, we planned to take the kids out to  urlLink Knight's Action Park . However, Tuesday it was only around 78 degrees outsides, so it wasn’t looking too promising.   When we got over to the Freeman’s at 8:00, a friend of Kyle’s named Rachel was over watching TV. Turns out her parents left for work and were going to leave her at home alone. (She’s nine years old!) So, Rachel said she would hang out over at the Freeman’s and her mom just dropped her off in front of the house as she drove by. She didn’t even come up to the door to talk to Kyle and Miranda’s mom. It was insane. Miranda was over at Heather Hurley’s dad’s house and planned to be home around noon.   Rachel woke up Kyle shortly after his mom left for work and they went out to get the baby bunnies they had found and put their grubby little fingers all over, forcing their mother to abandon them. The kids put them down the slide and insisted to their mom that the bunnies liked it. They also held them in one hand while they rode around the neighborhood on their bikes.   Mark brought Miranda home around noon like she had said. She was glad to finally meet Doug.   Doug drove out to Pizza hut in Sangamon Center to pick up breadsticks for me. When he got there, he realized I had forgotten to give him the money to pay and he didn’t have any cash with him. So, I had to send him across the street to the ATM by Hollywood Video. I felt super bad. He got the cash and the breadsticks and made it home just fine without getting lost at all. The breadsticks were super weird though. I can’t explain. They were like, really crispy and didn’t have very much of the seasoning stuff on them. They were still good, just not as good as Pizza Hut breadsticks usually are.   Here’s the best part of the day. While Doug was out getting me lunch, the kids surprised me with a birthday cake! They put candles in the shape of “17” and sang to me and everything! It was really cute. And later, their mom told me that Kyle (a nine year old) had made the cake on his own and that she only helped him to ice the cake.    urlLink  ' alt='The cake the kids surprised me with!'>     Kyle went out biking and chasing the ice cream truck around the neighborhood for a while then he came back from biking for long enough to ask if he could ride his bike with his friends to Subway. Subway is on a road with four lanes of traffic and is near one of the two traffic lights in Sherman. Heck no, I wouldn’t let him ride his bike there. So I offered to drive him and his friends over there and never really got a definite answer as to whether or not they wanted to. They left and came back fifteen minutes or so later and said that they had gotten a mom to ride with them. So, I figured that would be okay. He left and Miranda, Doug, and I donked around and played Life and such. But then, after two and a half or so hours and he wasn’t back and hadn’t checked in, I started to get worried.   Miranda didn’t help. She said that Kyle was probably lying and that there probably was no parent with them. So, that was the last straw. Doug stayed at home to keep an eye out for Kyle while Miranda and I went to Subway to look for Kyle. There was no sign of him, so we drove around the neighborhood for 20 some minutes. No sign of him or his friends. So, I came back to their house and sat around worrying and being very on edge. Finally, Miranda put two and two together and realized whose house he was at and went down the street to see if he was there. He was. And she yelled at him enough to make him cry (and come home). Turns out he had not only gone to Subway, but to the bank, the gas station, and to get candy (who knows where.)! I was thrilled. Gr!   Shortly after Kyle got home, so did his Dad. We got off at 3 instead of 4:35 because his dad had an appointment. It was nice. We went home and donked around for an hour and then got a head start on the garden project.    urlLink     urlLink     Doug cut off the bottom five or so feet of the tree branches while I dug up the walking stones and got rid of the grass that had covered them. Then I got in the explorer and managed to back it perfectly up to the trailer so we could put the branches in the trailer and take them down to the burning pile in the pasture.   After we dumped the branches, I took off my gloves and picked up a rake. And immediately got a splinter. It was really gross and hurt a bunch. It broke the skin really weird. Like, it scraped the skin and then got stuck. Doug couldn’t pull it out with the tweezers cuz it was in there really weird and kept coming out in little pieces. He put Vaseline and a band-aid on it and we went back out to work. After we reached a stopping point in the garden, Doug finally cut it with the nail clippers and pulled it out the top. He didn’t warn me before he cut the skin open because he was afraid I might freak out and not want him to do it and it was something he had to do.   After we had worked on the garden for an hour or two, dad called us in for dinner. We had spaghetti with my grandpa’s homemade sauce. It was yummy except that there were little bits of steak in the sauce. My grandpa puts steak in the sauce when he cooks it, for flavor. But this time he cooked it too long and it fell apart in the sauce. Dad made garlic bread, green beans, and Mrs. Paul’s Salad. We got the recipe from her last spring when my family and I went out there and my parents fell in love with the salad. We got back to work pulling weeds and tilling up the ground and all and then called it quits before Ice Deli closed.   Doug got a Pina Colada and I got Tear Jerker, as usual! It’s funny how when I go there I don’t have to order. Most of the people that work there know my regular!   When we got home, Doug emailed his mommy. He took forever though. I got frusterated since I have very little patience. He must have taken like 45 minutes to write the email and it really wasn’t very long and detailed. I finally had to set a time for him to finish up by.    Wednesday, June 23, 2004    Wednesday we went to the Freeman’s again. Their mom asked what our plans were for the day and I told her that it was supposed to get up to 85 and asked if it would be okay to go to Knights for the day. She said that would be fine and went to get more money. She only had $18 with her, so she offered to run to the bank but I told her it was no big deal and that I could use my money. So she gave me the 18 that she had and left for work. So around 10:00, Miranda still wasn’t awake yet, so we decided we should get her up so we could get our moneys worth at Knights. We went in there and I didn’t want to say anything or shake her cuz I’d never woken her up before. So, I took a picture of her in hopes of the flash waking her up. She didn’t open her eyes, so Kyle burped really loud. And she sat straight up in bed without opening her eyes and screamed “GET OUT!!!” and laid right back down. It was seriously one of the funniest things I had ever seen.   So, we finally got her up and going and convinced that it wasn’t too chilly out for Knights. When we got there, I paid for mine and the kids’ tickets with my own money so that I wouldn’t get it confused how much she owed me since there wasn’t enough for me to pay with just the money their mom gave me. So I paid, and it came to like $48 for the three of us, or something. Later I used their mom’s money to pay for putt-putting and lunch. To make a long story short, on Thursday when I got paid, I only made $110. I normally make $90 so the $20 was to cover gas and their admission to Knights (which is $18.50 apiece or $16.50 with the coupons I forgot to use).   We had a great time at the park. Miranda didn’t want to get in the water in the beginning because it was a little bit chilly out and it was only 11 or so, so it wasn’t really warm outside yet, either. We got on lazy river to get used to the water, and that seemed to help. Then we headed over to the wave pool. Doug seemed to be pretty impressed by it. After that, we went to the peddle boats on the pond. Luckily Doug was with us and is legally and adult, otherwise I wouldn’t have been old enough to take the kids out on the boat. After peddle-boating for a while, Miranda and I went down the  urlLink new slide  together. The only bummer about the slide is that you have to carry up a heavy-ish, two person tube up lots and lots of stairs. Miranda made me go down backwards, which freaked me out because I couldn’t see how close I was to the edge. I had a lot of fun though!   After Miranda and I scoped out the new slide, we headed for the old, classic slides while Doug and Kyle went on the lazy river (Kyle’s favorite). Doug was VERY helpful on our trip. He made things a lot easier since we didn’t have to fight about where to go. We’d just split up if there was a disagreement. When we girls split from the boys I pecked Doug on the lips (as sort of a “thank you for taking Kyle”), thinking neither of the kids were watching. However, Miranda saw and kept asking us to kiss in front of her the rest of the day. She was so impressed by the fact that we kissed. I forgot that when you’re twelve, kissing is still a VERY big deal.   So Miranda and I went down the old slides several times and went back to meet up with Doug and Kyle. Miranda offered to hang out with Kyle at the bottom of the slides so Doug and I could have a little fun and go down them together. It was really sweet how cooperative both of them were.   Then we headed to get some lunch. We waited in line for 35 minutes and there were only like four people in front of us. It was ridiculous. Kyle, Miranda, and I all got cheese pizza. Except Miranda was convinced that she tasted pepperoni on hers, even though we lifted up the cheese and there was no pepperoni on the pizza. Doug and I thought that was pretty funny.   As everyone finished lunch, Miranda and I went in the bathroom to attempt to do something with our long, luxurious lochs. While I was in there, I noticed a little girl crying with a scraped knee and a mommy trying to wipe it off with a paper towel. I offered a band-aid because I had luckily thought to throw some in my bookbag as I walked out the door. So I brought in my Veggie Tales band-aids and the little girl quit crying and the mom thanked me over and over saying that I “really saved the day.” I love how simple things like that can make you feel so good. Doug and I also gave two of our spare quarters to some girls that had their quarters eaten by one of the rental lockers.   After we finished up eating and putting my sun block on, we let Kyle roam free for a few minutes on lazy river and told him to go around 2 ½ times and to meet us on the other side by the new slide. Doug and I were going to try it out. It was a lot less scary the second time, but I still had to sit backwards, and I still lost my tummy!   When Kyle met back up with us, we decided to go putt-putting and went to buy our balls and putters. However, it took forever for the girl to actually give us some service, and by that time, I realized how outrageous the prices were for as crappy as the course is. So I told the kids I would take them over to Boulder Creek Fun Park instead.    urlLink     urlLink       I’m glad we did end up leaving Knight’s. Not only are the courses much newer and more well-kept, but the owner gave us a discount for leaving Knight’s and going there. Kyle whooped all our butts, but I got second! I’m so bad at putt-putting, but I must say that that was one of my better games.    urlLink     urlLink       By the time we got back from our outing, there was only a half an hour before their dad got home from work. We just sat and talked and had tickle fights and all. I felt really silly when their dad walked in the door when I was on the floor having a tickle fight with everyone.   On the way home, I decided that since we were practically driving right by Rhia’s that we might as well stop. We did. Mertyle answered the door and said the Boo was out. But only a couple minutes after we got there, Rhia and Halley showed up! We hung out in their basement for 45 minutes or so and Rhia gave us yummy nerds! This was the first time Doug and Rhia actually got to talk in person after knowing each other for years. When he was here last June/July, we attempted to meet up with her, but it was only for a couple minutes in the parking lot of Family Video because at the time, Rhia was dating Bobby and Bobby forbid that she hang out with Doug! What a weirdo.   After we got home, we checked the weather and it said that it was supposed to storm on Thursday. Kind of a problem since we really needed to work on the garden some more. So, we decided we should probably not go to Oasis. I regret it now, but I guess I’m glad the garden got done.   Both of us were starving from being so active all day, so Mom treated us to dinner at Cancun. I ordered the same thing I always order. A sopapilla. However, for some odd reason, this time I became unusually addicted to the chips and cheese sauce and didn’t really want my sopapilla. I intended to tear myself away from the chips and eat it anyway, but there was entirely too much cinnamon for my liking, so Doug ended up eating it for me!   When we got home around 7, Doug and I worked on the garden. We worked more or less non-stop except for our break for ice deli and our Wal*Mart run (at 9:30) for four more plants and four more bags of mulch. When we called it quits for the night at 11:00, we had planted all of the plants. Doug dug (teehee). I planted and filled. Mom Watered. Lots of progress was made.    urlLink         Thursday, June 24, 2004    Doug and I both woke up somewhat crabby Thursday morning, but it luckily didn’t make much of a difference on our moods for the rest of the day. We watched the kids again and more or less did nothing. My wrist was really bothering me for some reason. Plus, I had slammed it in the back door, so it hurt to bend a couple fingers.   Doug and I took the kids out to lunch at Subway. Miranda has an obsession with their food but Kyle wasn’t to enthusiastic about it, so Kyle just got a cookie.   After that, Doug went out to Strings ‘N’ Things to pick up a replacement string for my guitar. I wrote out directions how to get there from my house (he had to run home and get his wallet) but he got a little confused as to which road was Dirsken because there was no visible sign. Luckily, he guessed correctly and made it to Strings ‘N’ Things without too much trouble. [Annotation by Doug: I didn't guess! It just took me forever to find a freakin' street sign! Darn construction...]   When he got back, we played and sang but the kids didn’t seem to be too impressed and just turned up the T.V.   Doug and I walked through the cornfield and down the broken bridge after we got off work. I showed Doug how to detassle corn and explained the purpose as we were walking. We had quite the adventure getting there because I didn’t realize that my uncle had a mowed path leading right to it. And when we ran across the path, I failed to use any reasoning and went the total wrong way through thorny weeds that were taller than me. In addition, We took my camera, but it turns out the battery was dead because I had left it plugged into the computer all day. We got enough energy out of it to get the camera open, but then we couldn’t get enough to get it closed and cover the lens, so I had that to worry about the whole time. The banks were pretty muddy and slick but at least I got to show Doug the broken bridge and where mine and my cousins’ names used to be carved clearly into a tree. Then we walked through “The Back” so I could show Doug where I go sledding in the winter and we ran into Robby on his bike. Aunt barb told me later that he thought it was two guys. Yes, I was dressed that unattractively.   When we came home my parents had already eaten dinner but they saved us two hamburgers off the grill, some hash browns, and some corn. Then we got back to work in the garden. We worked on mulching and all and ended up deciding we needed eight more bags of mulch in addition to the eight we already had.   So, we made another 9:30 Wal*Mart run. This time, when we were in the parking lot walking towards the mulch, we heard some guy trying to get our attention. Turns out, it was some guy in his like, late 20’s trying to return a cooler. He said he was from Texas and wanted to return the cooler because he needed gas money but that he was driving on a ticket and that they needed an ID to get him a refund without a receipt. So, we attempted to return the cooler for him. And as we were walking in the door, he asked us if we “smoke the reefer” and that if we did he’d get us a hook up. It was very interesting. They wouldn’t take the cooler back. They said there’s a new policy that they have to have a receipt, but I think they either recognized the cooler or saw the guy talking to us. It was interesting.   When we got home, I got out my dad’s new halogen lamps and we took forever to set them up. But when we did, they did a very nice job of lighting up the garden. So we finished up mulching and all. It ended up being a $200 project but we had fun.    Friday, June 25, 2004    Friday, Doug and I slept in until 10. All the gardening and other activities really wore us out. Once we finally got up and moving we went out to do minor tweaking in the garden. We attempted to mow the grass. Doug helped me get it started and I mowed a pretty large area outside the fence and then handed it over to Doug to mow for a while. While he was mowing I swept mulch off of the walking stones. However, that didn’t last long because the mower started making a really weird noise and a big chunk of metal flew off. We went to turn the mower over to see what had happened and oil started spilling out into the grass. Doug was worried the oil would kill the grass so we put dish soap on the lawn and hosed it down.    urlLink       We called my daddy to let him know what ha happened and he knew what had happened without even looking at the mower. In short, the mower is shot. We’re borrowing my aunt’s old mower until we have the funds for a new one.   Then we headed to ice deli! Doug got cream soda this time and it was excellent. He was astounded by the fact that it was a pretty dark red. Kind of a pinky-red. But still not the color you would expect with a cream soda. We played and sang as usual. And as we were leaving we saw the kids working in the booth clapping for us and then the guy complimented Doug.   We returned from ice deli and by then, my parents were on the way home. So we went upstairs to get started on making the card for my dad. I wanted to make it but I’m awful with Photoshop so I let Doug take over and I just gave him an idea of what I wanted. Well, Doug being Doug… the perfectionist lefty that he is, took like fifteen years to make the card. Mom and I thought it was hysterical how he tried to make the little things too flawless. So when Doug finally finished up, we took Dad out to see his garden and let him open his card. He really liked it. It seems to open up the yard and made it seem bigger.    urlLink       We were supposed to visit Lisa and fix up her computer. We had to download several things and burn them onto a CD since she has dial-up. The download was orginaly supposed to take longer than we had expected…four hours. So we wouldn’t have been able to get to Lisa’s until like 8:45 or after and we had already made plans to go to dinner and the  urlLink Drive-In!  with my parents. So we talked with Lisa and decided to postpone our visit until Saturday.   So we went out to Cheddars with my parents. The food was excellent but Dad was the only one to finish his food. Then, we headed out to the Drive-In. We ended up being an hour early… but strangely enough there were quite a few other people there before us. With an hour to spare, we took tons of pictures of ourselves and just goofed around.    urlLink     We saw Shrek 2. I really liked it and so did my parents!   When we returned from the movie… the download we needed for Lisa still wasn’t finished! In the end, it ended up taking more than eight hours for the download to complete.    Saturday, June 26, 2004    Saturday we got up decently early to meet up with Aunt Sue at the new Panera for my birthday. I got some Yankee Candle air fresheners and El Arbol Generoso (The Giving Tree in Spanish) and the Cat in the hat in both English and Spanish, and breakfast! I had an asiago cheese bagel and a DePeach Mode to drink. Yummy! Doug had a cinnamon crunch bagel and actually used the entire container of cream cheese. He’s goofy.   Then, Doug and I headed out to the mall for some photo booth pictures and ended up running into Aunt Sue there! I desperately wanted to get a new tee and had a gift card from Rach for Hot Topic. So I ignored the fact that Kennedy was working and bought myself a fun tee.    urlLink       Then we hurried home to burn the second CD for Lisa’s incredibly screwed up computer. When that finished, we went over to the Delong’s so Doug could work his magic on their computer. Then, when he reached a good stopping point, then we went out to camp CILCA for a picnic.    urlLink      Lisa’s mommy made us some incredibly yummy fried chicken and potato salad. Then, we met tons of her friends and went out canoeing!    urlLink       Then we went back to Lisa’s so we could finish up with the computer. While we were waiting for windows to reinstall, Doug and I played guitar and sang. Lisa’s aunt and mom had apparently heard us and when her dad and uncle came in, they asked us to play and sing some more. Her aunt came in and told him he did a nice job. It was really cute!   Lisa had to leave for work shortly after that, but we stayed and her sister, Emily, checked in on us to make sure we didn’t need anything. We finally gave up on the computer. It wasn’t’ recognizing her modem, so we couldn’t get the updates for Norton Anti-Virus that we needed to get rid of the viruses plaguing her computer.   We made one last ice deli run since it was Doug’s last day. They were out of cherry so I couldn’t get my usual flavor. I got cream soda instead since I had tried Doug’s. It was excellent. Doug got a different flavor every time we went. This time he tried Apple Kiss. We saw Dylan on his break from IGA and he came and chatted with us! Then, when we were finished, Doug stole my keys and pretended to leave without me. I freaked out because he backed out really fast when a car was pulling in. He wasn’t about to hit it or anything… I just imagine it still freaked out the people pulling in.   Then we headed downtown. We had planned on going to Andiamo for diner. When we got there it was closed. Bummer. So we sorta decided to go to Starbucks. We started walking towards it and the decided to go to Café Brio instead and for some reason continued walking towards Starbucks. We then realized when we were almost to Starbucks when we realized that we needed to turn around!    urlLink        We finally made our way towards Café Brio and as we walked by Z Bistro’s, some girl was checking out Doug. But he just put his arm around me. It was really cute. When we finally got to the restaurant, we both ended up just getting my favorite dessert. And we goofed off and took some really hot pictures.    urlLink     urlLink      We argued forever about how much to tip. Our meal was $12.83 and I said to leave $5 tip and Doug said $4. But the waitress was really nice! And I always tip large.   We then started heading towards the Drive-In. Except we realized that we were going to be an hour and a half early and that we had forgotten hoodies and blankets. So we headed over to Target to kill some time and get something to keep us warm. Doug bought me a WAY cute baby blanket featuring my very favorite carebear… none other than Funshine Bear! We headed back to the Drive-In and ended up being like, 55 minutes early.   I went up to get us some popcorn and while I was up there, I ran into a guy that looked familiar. And he recognized me and was like “Lydia? I’m Tonya’s husband!” and then I put things together and realized it was Mrs. Faloon-Sullivan’s hubby! I thought it was pretty cool that he remembered me!   When Doug and I got back to the car, there were a couple more cars parked next to us. We ended up not needing the blanket very much because we kept the windows up due to some inconsiderate smokers next to us. The girls to our right smoked a cigarette every 10 minutes. And between the two of them, it was a constant thing. Then, on our left, was a creepy couple. I guy that had to be, like, 47 or older with a girl that couldn’t have been much more than like, 22. It was pretty gross. And whenever Doug and I would kiss, He’d stare in our window! It was pretty creepy.   I got to stay for both shows for the first time. I’m finally seventeen and don’t have a legal curfew anymore, so my parents let me see the double feature. We saw The Stepford Wives and Mean Girls. Both the shows were pretty good. Not my favorite movies, but I liked them.   On the way home, I nearly hit a deer, and a drunk driver leaving the bar pulled out in front of me, and then I had to swerve to miss a staggering, drunk cowboy walking along the side of the road at 1:30 in the morning with no reflective gear on. We finally made it home shortly after that. I was pretty exhausted so I fell asleep shortly after I laid down.    Sunday, June 27, 2004    Sunday was the day we’d been dreading all week. Blech. We left around 7:10 for Saint Louis. I slept the entire way there.    urlLink      And we arrived at the airport around 9. We got in line for Doug’s check in. It took forever cuz they only had one desk open. Our plan was to buy my ticket before Doug left. He had to be present to buy them because the voucher was in his name. So I realized that if the line didn’t speed up that Doug would run late and that we wouldn’t be able to buy my ticket. So, my parents went to stand in the line that we needed to be in the buy the tickets.   When we finally got done checking Doug in, we went over to the American Airlines line where my parents were and went to buy my tickets. We gave the lady our $250 voucher and our $13 voucher. But, she wasn’t very familiar with trying to combine two vouchers to buy one ticket, so it took her a while to figure it out. Doug had to leave to catch his flight before the lady finished with the tickets, so I didn’t get to walk him to security or anything. And it turns out, the plane was late and he could have stayed. Bummer.   I ended up having to pay $24 for the ticket because it was $307! Usually the tickets are around $240 so I didn’t think I’d have to pay for any of it with the vouchers. I checked the other prices for flights from STL to PHL when I got home and it was just that flight that was so expensive. It was really weird. Oh well.   After we bought the tickets, we went down to Doug’s terminal to see if we could make it before we left, but we couldn’t go past security so I didn’t really get to say goodbye. Bummer.   And that concludes our week.
