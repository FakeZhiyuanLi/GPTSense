      Okay, so today hasnt been the best day of my life. but anyday with my friends in it is good. ANYWAY, i'm watching FOX Family and the show Family Matters is on. I go through the next 30 minutes watching these "normal" folks go through there everyday lives. Well, there almost normal. The only thing that isnt normal, other then the characters hanging from roofs, saving the day or doing whatever else they do, is that there problems are all solved within the allotted. Wouldnt life be great if we could just have our problems solved by the end of the day? But as I began to think about it, I realize life was not meant to be easy. Our problems and the way we handle those difficult situations mold us into the wonderful people that God has allowed us to become. Everyone always wants to find an easy way out. A route where they wont hurt anyones feelings or wont make anyone uncomfortable, or maybe even themselves uncomfortable. Life is meant to be challenging at times. Thats what makes it exciting and an experience of a "lifetime"!  Wow, i feel better.    Keep it real peeps, Keep it really real!  ~*~Anna

      Tonite me and Jonathan went to Target to waste the summer nite away! We saw our old math teacher Mrs. Cole! We chatted with her for a while. We talked about how bad Jonathan used to act in math class and how I was very studious (lol, yea right)!! After Target we went to Wal-Mart! As we were walking through the fishing section, I proceeded to talk like a hick and acted like I new about bass, the fish not the stereo part!! ;-) These two guys looked at me like I was a stupid redneck, or one of their relatives! It was great fun, mainly because Jonathan was completely and totally embarassed!! After that we went over to walk at the Civic Center! I love summer nites, espcially when you're with cool people!! The ducks were quacking and the mosquitos were biting. But all in all it was a good nite. God has blessed me with incredible people in my life whome I can have fun with and laugh! Nothing could be better then playing on Concord Elem. School's playground at 10 o'clock at nite with a great friend! I LOVE MY LIFE!! Well I hope everyone's summer is going great!!  I love you all very much! :-)  Peace!  ~*~Anna

      Tonite me and the coolest girl ever Amy went running!! Our intentions, as always, was to run a good 3 miles. It may not seem like a lot to some people but for the less inspired (as ourselves) it was quite a load. Well we were running down Boulevard and Amy looks at me and says "I dont feel so well." To make a long story short, Amy got sick and I had to check on her at the H.P. on 81. What a great summer nite! It was the best :).   Later my homies and my peeps!  ~*~Anna

      Hey people, you must like me a lot to be reading this stuff. All of you know I'm not a good writer/thinker. Anyway, I got caught on to Caroline M.'s blog so I wanted to do one. She cant have all the fun!  I just got free stuff in the mail!! Isn't that the best feeling in the world, getting something you didn't expect at all! MMMMM I love it. Well I'll be posting periodically or when something exciting happens (or when im just really bored). Im out for a bit. BYE PEEPS!

      tonite was great! it started off with baptism, wow. talk about god and heat! it was hot as the devil but seeing all those people make a public profession of their faith was awesome! Michelle kept WOOing as one by one people got dunk'd!! then amy and lindsay went to Scholtskzy's. MMMM, great food! then went stood outside AmStar debating on whether to go see The Village, Cindrella Story, or Bourne Supremacy!! I'd already seen Cinderella twice and The Village so we went to see if this time we could make it all the way through The Bourne Supremacy without Lindsay blowing chunks!! We indeed were successful! GREAT MOVIE!! I loved it. I cant wait to go see the next one. I'm seriously gonna read the books. I mean, i probably wont. But i'll try!! Well homies its off to bed. Have a day!!  Love you all,  - anna -

      one and a half thumbs up! i liked most of it. the first 20min were kinda of draggin! this is a movie either you'll like it or hate it. me personally, i liked it alot. it was good! and a good ending! but, my parents didnt like it. jonathan thought it was okay. so you go and tell me what you think of it!! by tha way, it was a little jumpy. Tonite was a lot of fun. After the movies Johnny and I went to Toys R Us. OH WHAT FUN! i love acting like a kid. it brings back great memories. AHHHHHHH. Then we went to have supper with the parental unit at Capri's. that was, for lack of a better word, interesting! we ended the nite going to HollyWood video and walkin up and down all the isle's naming our fav. movie. then we venntured over to Blockbuster and did the same. It was a great nite. Had lots of fun and laughs! Tomorrow nite at baptism should be even more fun!! YAY for God!  love you all!  - anna g -

      Okay! so i'm really excited bc, in approximately 3hrs and 12min i'm going to see The Village! this movie looks really good. and i get excited about paying an over priced amount to go get the movie experience! Scary movies are by far the best movies ever! Especially if you go with someone who hates them (Jonathan). thats exactly why i wanted him to go with me! bc, i can play off of his fear. oh friends, this will be fun. hopefully he wont get sick and have to leave during the middle of it like SOME people!! i'm just playing Lindsay Owens! well people!! this will be a glorious day! and it looks like a storm is a'comin! so i'm off.  peace and chicken!  - anna g -

      So, the finale of gus's rd. show was tonite. WOW, it was the most nastiest, ickyest thing i have ever done. but i give my props to the game masters, they made it a lot of fun!!! Good job boys, very creative! I broke my toe I think. how sad! anyway, back to the good stuff. i think tonite was the first time i ever gagged at church. WAIT, no, mayo-filled do-nuts was the first time i gagged at church. that was just nasty. i saw some kid get nailed in the face was a bag full of chum! that was hilarious! even after a shower I can still smell the clam juice or whatever that rank stuff was.  Oh, another bonus was seeing Dustin run like the wind. that guy has got speed. then after one race he's done for! but i did miss the youth workers who werent there. Especially randy! i know he would have made it a lot more fun!! not that he would have been the only one!!  well people the best of part of the day would have to be gettin my classes for my senoir year! get this 3 days a week i only have two classes!! how great is that. Anderson College classes and early dismissal absolutely rock my sox off!! wow!!! aight, i'm going to bed. tonite wore me out!! time for some shut eye!! have a great day ya'll!   PS- advice for the day- dont throw bark, it'll put someone's eye out. *Rachel West*  PSS- is anyone's hotmail account not letting them log in so they can check their email or is it just mine?

      It's 11:10pm tuesday nite. and i'm listening to Tigeroar on the Windows Media Player. I love Tigeroar, I mean guys who can sing and beat box are just so cool.&nbsp; As I've mentioned before my math teacher was in Tigeroar. Jonathan, wasnt he a cutie patootie lol. He was cool, I mean for a math teacher and all!  To the next random thing, I want an iPod. It doesnt even have to be a mini one. Just an iPod will do. I need something to put all the songs I love into one compact device! I mean, who goes from wanting to listen to Usher to wanting to hear Alison Krauss or however you spell it! I also want a picture phone. I'll pay for it. If someone will give me the money. I mean, I have a job.&nbsp; Not a steady one, but it still pays good. I also want to play the guitar. Maybe thats my problem, I want to many things.&nbsp; Nah, that couldnt be it!! lol.  Now, I start thinking about Isaac. I try not to think about that to much when i'm alone. I get sad. Not all the time, I mean the kid is absolutely wonderfully AWESOME!! I have more fun talking to him then I do with some people my own age. But lately, I just get sad. I started thinking about my moms old high school friend. To say the least she was a partyer. Still is. Has a liver who in her own stupidity destroyed it. And heres Isaac, completely innocent little boy who's born with a liver that isnt the best for him. I dont understand stand sometimes. But we're not suppose to understand all the time. I love that family. They mean a lot to a lot people at NSCC. OKAY, i really have to stop now.  As I conclude my very random post i just want to say, have a great life. Enjoy your friends and family and be nice!! I love you all!   Peace and Chicken  - anna g -

      So, this summer was full of mixed emotions. Saying goodbye to friends and starting new relationships with new friends can always be awkard, but exciting. I've closed a lot of chapters in my life this summer and started tons of new ones!! I met a wonderful new person and re-kindled an old best friend relationship. Cara and Jonathan are two of the coolest people I know. I mean, I know TONS of cool people. But these two people have been big this summer. Cara is an old friend from 1st grade. We were best friends for 7 years. Then all that came to a screeching halt when she went to a different school. We lost touch even though she was 15 min. away. But we always seem to get together during the holidays and summer. This summer was just special for some reason. Now Jonathan is my newest and dearest friend. Yes people, friend. LOL.&nbsp; But we've come to know each other a lot better this summer. Its fun hanging out with an old best friend and a new best friend!!  Well the summers almost over, i'm not going to waste it sitting here writing. I'll post more later. I gotta go talk to the beautiful rachael west!! holla!

Last nite me and amy went over to Lindsay's apartment. We baked cookies and made egg sandwich's!! They were delicious!! Those are two AWESOME ladies.

      its thursday nite, 11:25pm, and im bored. im not tired enough to go to bed. i have nothing else to look up on the net. i've read EVERYONE's blog at least 4 times. all my friends that dont have to work, are on vacation. and i'm sitting here. actually thinking someone is going to read this blog. who am i kidding, i know no one reads mine. i mean, mine isnt as good as Joshua's, LB's, Lee's, Angela's, Caroline's, or Jon's. I cant be as creative as the person who write the BIG TRUTHS. ;-) so i'm just rambling. dont get me wrong, dont think i get sad because people dont post (;-)). and i am i happy child. look at the people i hang out with, susan, amy (we still havnt ran 3miles), jonathan, randy, linds, and all you other great great people. its just at 11:30 theres not to many people to talk to. the ones you want to talk to are in Hilton Head or Hawaii. and the other ones have jobs and have to get up in the morning. but i am entertaining myself watching Footlose. this is the frist time i've seen it. i know i'm a little behind.   i ate mexican tonite. it was quit delectable. then i went to see my g'ma. she's great. quit the wise crack!! now i'm talking to angela about my hot math teacher mr. ramsey. he was in tiger roar...mmm mmmmm good!! LOL JK!  i'm out...HOLLA

      Last nite the entire youth group went bowling. The original plan was to watch movies on an island, but due to the rain the youth workers moved on to plan B. So we're at the bowling alley, i didnt have any socks..along with a lot of other people who wore flops. Well I still had to wear those nasty, but stylish, bowling shoes! By the way, a great b'day present would be bowling shoes..size 11..I know I know BIG feet!!! Anyway back to my story. Caroline Holmes (CH) and Amy Marshall and amanda, and I believe two Chelsea's were in my group. 3 A's and 3 C's. I beat them all I did with my big 76! BOO-YAH :-) ! CH and I put some tunes on the juke box..I picked Nelly's Hot in Herrr and CH picked Mariah Carey some song. Then we got 50 Cent on! It was great fun! I loved every minute of it. Even as I was singing Boston's "More Than A Feeling" to Jamie Beaver. OH YES, what great fun!! But I do think I got some fungus from the nasty bowling shoes!! YUCK!  Bowling, its a way of life!

      OH Yea, i mean there maybe one more out there that is borderline the campus group i go to, but i highly doubt it! Yes, i have the best leaders, Susan, Randy, Jamie, and Blackman (Travis) and the people there are really cool. I mean, i love ALL the youth workers, you get really close to 'em, ya know! ;-) :-D They have to be the coolest people in the world..i mean, i dont know very many people who want to hang out with a bunch on teenagers at least twice a week! those, my friends, are cool people!!  Well, I start my AC class in the morning, im a little nervous, i'll admit, but nothing I cant handle! Maybe i'll see some of you cool youth workers around..I got class Tuesdays and Thursday at 8 at the Sullivan building!  I love Seinfield, so much that im going to leave my blogging now and go watching!   Love you....

      i hate waking up and feeling even more tired than when i went to sleep! those thunderstorms kept me up last nite. i started The Wedding by Nicholas Sparks, wow it was great..sorry Randy, but I think The Bourne Identity is gonna have to wait. Today I'm gonna feel like a real college student, because I have to go to AC and buy my English 101 books, wow, its almost time to graduate and move onto bigger and better things! I'm ready, really I am!   Aight, well, i'm gonna try to sleep a little more,    Love you....

      i read LB's blog and I was thinking the same thing, about myself of course! Its so frustrating sometimes when you feel like everything you do, everything you put your feelings and heart into isnt good enough. Like you're never pretty enough, skinny enough, smart enough, funny enough, Godly enough, or like no one really gives a darn about you. I mean, I know I have friends and family and an amazing God who loves me...but sometimes theres a void. Like, it can be filled one minute and completely empty the next. I guess, you just have to keep truckin' no matter what. God loves me, and that all that matters.  Well, enough venting..im going to go run it out of me!     Love you....

      This past week for me has just been incredible, from finding out good news, to knowing that i got in a class that i really wanted to, to filling out college applications. I mean, life has just been great. I wake up every morning excitied and ready to go school, come home and do whatever!! I mean, i love my church, my friends, my family and im just so incredibly blessed. I dont have to be at school till 10:00am. But if I wake up at 7:40am (like i did this morning) I just get up, I mean I try to go back to sleep I just can't because I know something good is in store for the day!  Okay, sorry for going off like that!!! WOW, but anyway, I gotta go do homework before I go to school. I love this late arrival stuff!  Love ya...

I confessed to my biggest thrill of the nite is getting on to the computer and talking to people. Especially cool people! LOL. Then I annouced I had no friends really outside of church..I do. Just not people I go out with and stuff. See, im secure enough with myself to annouce this to the cyber world! Other than that church was great!! Awesome sermon by Dustin..very moving! I wore my cute tube sox and amy wore her matching ones!! :-) YAYA!!  I got a book from Randy to read,  it was The Bourne Identity. I think the best part of the nite was showing up all the guys on the court, c'mon guys you know i got game!! lol..RIGHT, i couldnt even dunk a donut...WOW, i shouldnt say that out loud!  Well guys hope you're weekend was great...more to come....hopefully!! :-D

Then Amy and I went to the mall. We saw Brielle, Alexia, and Hayley there. Those girls are so crazy..they followed me around Aeropostal and I didnt even see them! Yea, im blind. Then it was onto Books-A-Million. Amy squilled like a little girl in there. She was so happy to find the book, umm...i dont even remember!! It was, needless to say, a kids book!! After the fun conversation there...oh yea it was a good one...we went to target where we picked up some stuff and amy yelled at my spanish student teacher who was half way across the store. WOW, good times good times. Then i started feeling icky again so we left.  Thats about it people. Tomorrow is SUNDAY!! Which is the best day of the week. I see all my cool friends, all 2 of them!! and go to the awesomest youth group in the world, OH YEA!! Life cant get much better..  well friends im out..  l8er sk8er boi's

SPANISH ROCKS! i decided i was gonna help jonny study spanish. i know my verbs and phrases, i got those down! I havnt had spanish for over a year and I still remember them. Mostly because the beautiful and talented Jamie Beaver helped me in my days of learning them. We studied, maybe he remember the hints i gave, i dont know!  Reality tv, i love it. I do, im not going to lie! But i hate Big Brother. I dont know why, it just seems....nasty!  I dont know what to write. Im just rambling. I cant wait till Mudd Bowl, Adam you're going down!! Im going to just go all out and tackle everyone who comes within 5 feet of me! make that 3 feet!! YAY for dirt!  God made dirt, dirt wont hurt!!  Peace out yall!!!

      So as you know I went to Cincinatti this weekend! WOW, it was great. I was so elated to see Sammy, Melissa, and Isaac. We laughed and laughed. I stayed with Melissa when it was her shift with Isaac. He is such a smart, happy, funny little boy! Oh yea and he has the cutest little cheeks!! Saturday my mom, kate, and myself took Melissa to eat lunch at Applebee's on the riverfront. It was so pretty. The river is nasty, but it's definitly a pretty view! Sunday Isaac got discharged to the Ronald McDonald House. He was so excitied. We played outside and just hung around the room. Sammy was making butt noises, but thats okay, he's special!  OPPS, i gotta go get ready for school. I'll post more later! ByE

      So, tomorrow im signing outta school to go see sammy and melissa. im way excitied. im gonna stay with melissa and have some fun in the Ronald McDonald house! fun! tonite, another fun filled chat with Adam. We are the most random people. We can go from talking about, well i forgot what we first talked about, but it was something completely and totally random. Its craziness!! LOL.  So...im watching Fear Factor. They're bull riding...you'll never see me on a bull. no, you wont. not for anything, okay, maybe for a million buck, or 500,000 but thats it!  OH YEA, me and adam talked about mean boys. and how college guys (not all, there are some very Godly and respectable college guys whom I have the priviledge to know) get a thrill off taking advantage of girls who arent stubborn, or something like that!! lol...we both just vented. thats about it.  the most randomiest moment is when we went from relationships to heckling at high school football/basketball games! *NOTE- if you ever come to a basketball game of mine, i better not hear you yellin (Randy, Rachael, Susan, Lindsay, whoever you might be)!!  SO...yall pray that everything goes good this weekend that we have a safe trip. I hope to be back in time for youth sunday nite! But if not i'll see all you wonderful people the following Sunday!!!   Aight, time for bed. i got a long day tomorrow.  PS Adam im looking forward to Dawson's Creek re-enactment!! im so excitied!! :-D

       Outback 'needs to get a life'  Jack. Prissy stuck up little girls running around with everything hangin out, tryin to get a complete stranger to fall in love with them. i mean, HELLO!! just stop looking so much, i mean for all they know "the one" might be right under their stuck up little noses. Ugh, then they cry like they really loved him. Maybe they did, but its just hard to believe! Once again i'm done! Sorry, for all the complaining.       Out like a fat kid in dodge ball!

      tonite me and cara (the craziest person i know) decided my room was a mess and i needed to clean it. so we did. then some how it moved into my closet. i have a 5 foot walk in closet, full of old clothes, new clothes, my moms old clothes, and shoes, bags, and DUST! WOW, so much dust. By time we got done we were sneezing like a crazy mad man! I found GoodWill is gonna have some nice AE clothes. And Cara got a lot too. I'm telling you in about 5 months come to my closet, you might just get yourself a new wardrobe! We finally got done 2 and a 1/2 hours later! I forgot to tell you what happen during the first part of the evening! The coolest rain storm came. A huge 50 year old oak tree fell down in caras drive way. Its a long gravel drive way but none the less this was a huge tree!! It was crazy, we were stuck out there for 2 hours. So much rain caused the grass to by slick and muddy since they live on a hill. But it was fun being entertained by Tanner, Cara's brother!! Well i'm done. I'll talk to yall tomorrow. :-D :-) Arent smilies great, Adam! Yea, they are!!  Peace and Chicken!
