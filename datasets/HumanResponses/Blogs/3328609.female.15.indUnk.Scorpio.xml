 hhmmm...the end of the year...exams...last minute hand-ins...and..heeellloooo stress..hahah..  suprisingly i'm not to stressed about everything..i just want school to freakin end already!! now with all the exams and shna...i'll study..i'll take the exam..if i do bad, i do bad..if i pass it with a shnazzy mark..then...HAZAAA(i dont know why i keep saying that...) yesh..i've just relieved myself from a very stressful time..and i rather not get into it again..especially over school!! iuno... for all those who are getting stressed...study..and Trust! He will provide and if you do your part..then things get a lot easier!!
  
  
 
 i was in my room yesterday thinking about the school year..and how it seemed to fly by but take for ever at the same time...yepp...and it was weird remembering everything from the beginning of the year and looking at where i'm at now.  i was rememberin RevOne and Endurance and then recent Camp Enlighten...i remembered asking my principle if we could start up Highschool based..i remembered goin to the philippines.. just so much has happened..and i guess what i'm trying to say is that i could remember all these things like it was yesterday and now i'm already saying good-bye to grade 10...like wow..it just feels like everything went by so fast..but then there was the occasional days where it seemed like i was in school for 12 hours...yeah..but it's all good..cuz....SUMMER'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER!!  
   
 overall...i have to say i had a pretty good year!!  cant wait for all the shnazzy stuff that's been planned for the summer(conference, secter, folkfest...OooOooOo)!!  good stuff good stuff...

      Love is slow to lose patience
 It looks for a way of being constructive
 It is not possessive
 It is neither anxious to impress
 Nor does it cherish inflated ideas
 of its own importance
 Love has good manners
 And does not pursue selfish advantage.
 It is not touchy.
 It does not keep account of evil
 or gloat over the wickedness of other people.
 On the contrary, 
 It is glad with all good men
 When truth prevails.

 well yesh...it's kinda funny cuz the reason why i went to vancouver is cuz i wanted to spend some time with Richie while lauren attended a camp training...but things changed quite a bit..things got cancelled and i ended up seeing richie for only 3 hours..yyyeah..  i would have been really upset...and i'm not saying that i wasnt disapointed..i'm just saying that i'm not as mad as i prolly would have been cuz i'm so thankful that the Lord let me see him and that He blessed me with the 3 hours that i did get to spend with him.  when i think about it..yeah..i would be a much happier camper if we didnt have to cross a giant puddle to see eachother..but at the same time...having to do that makes me cherish the time that i do get to spend with him...and it makes everything so much more specialer...lol...SPECIALER!  
 
 hehehe...but yesh...i did have quite a good time with the mainlanders that me and lauren got to chillax with!!  from goin around with Richie and Dabz to MacDic's, my very first trip to Metro Town to bother Skwirrel as he showed us his skills at selling treadmils and to get Bubble Tea; to goin to john's house for 5 mins then vanessa's for 10 then to Phoa Hong with Benji, Renee, Jenilee, Mike, John, Vanessa and her nephew, Je...oh...and that thing called Jom; to goin to the CFC partay and jamming in JE's van with Jom; driving around with crazy JE to look for gas then ending up at his house..then goin back to the Partay and busting some dance moves with some CFC and some YFCers like Paul, Kaye, Mary Anne, Rizel...; to goin to Jen's and seeing Beamer and shleeping...  i just wanted thank all of you guys cuz Lauren and i had an oh-some time!! thank you jen for taking us to the terminis so damn early!!  
 
 hahaha...and today had a yard sale at my house for a fundraiser....it was pretty shnazzy!!  
 
 i had a great weekend!! and even tho i didnt really get to do wut i had planned on and i didnt get to spend as much time as i wanted to with my Boon.. i'm thankful for all the good times that the He blessed me with!!

 i opened my eyes to a world
 filled with such radiant beauty
 
 i felt the wind
 cradle me in it's arms
 
 as the sun's golden rays
 gently kissed my cheek
 
 my eyes are filled
 with the luminous colours that surround me
 
 i close my eyes
 and i hear the world singing a song 
 one that i've never heard before
 
 my breath taken
 by the purity of God's creation
 
 my heart smiles
 as i am filled with such happiness
 
 knowing that the Lord has made me a part
 of an everlasting blessing...
