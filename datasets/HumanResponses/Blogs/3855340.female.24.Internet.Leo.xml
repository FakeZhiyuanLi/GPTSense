      I Knew I Loved You (Savage Garden)   Maybe it's intuition But some things you just don't question Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant And there it goes I think I've found my best friend I know that it might sound more than a little crazy But I believe  I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life  There's just no rhyme or reason Only this sense of completion And in your eyes I see the missing pieces I'm searching for I think I've found my way home  I know that it might sound more than a little crazy But I believe  I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life  A thousand angels dance around you I am complete now that I've found you

      Shoulda Woulda Coulda Beverly Knight  People say that together we were both sides of the same coin That we would shine like Venus in a clear night sky We thought our love could overcome the circumstances But my ambition wouldn't allow for compromise  I could see in the distance all the dreams that were clear to me Every choice that I had to make left you on your own Somehow the road we started down had split asunder Too late to realise how far apart we'd grown. How I wish I, wish I'd done a little bit more  Now " Shoulda woulda coulda," means I'm out of time Coz "Shoulda woulda coulda", can't change your mind And I wonder, wonder, wonder what I'm gonna do "Shoulda woulda coulda" are the last words of a fool  People ask how it feels to live the kind of life others dream about I tell them everybody gotta face their highs and their lows And in my life there's a love I put aside, cause I was busy loving something else So for every little thing you hold on to, you've got to let something else go  Chorus  Fool if I would now forsake the opportunities are fate I know I'm right where I belong But sometimes when I'm not so strong I..  Chorus (x2) *********** I like this song a lot...remind me of someone :P

      I thought once, as young as a person is...he/she must plan his/her life. Got a choice..as to whether have a hard life or a good life with full of struggles.Where will you be?hmm..1,2,3 or 6 or 10 years from now?What kind of life will you gonna make?Things are always hard, sometimes it becomes harder coz we want it to be harder. There's always this exotic pleasure...I wonder if one day i'd be lying in bed with full of syringe,dextrose and medicines around me...will i be able to get a good life after?I bet i'd rather die than suffering that kind of dreadful thing.See? Some things lies in our hand, but those things are all unimportant. They are the basics...they go usually as planned.Careful analysis and sometimes experimental.But most of it,arent nice and easy. The more we want our life to be perfect, the more it becomes imperfect. I wonder why its always like that.And no matter how hard we try to have a good lasting life, the more things get so unwell.Is this a punishment? or maybe what some other say...our life is like a gift...we have to fill it with tiny little good things so when nature takes its due course..its loaded with fun filled memories. Memories which all our loved-ones can be treasured.When its unfilled, its like a box with nothing in it.Being alive doesnt last long...it's like a race...it always ends up with a finish line, no matter how long the race is.So when it ends, it ends.No weeping, no blaming coz thats how it works.Pathetic isnt it?Its the way each of us lives...

      I hate you from the bottom of my heart down to my nerves down to the last blood of my body...down to the last veins and arteries..to the small particles that composes me.You know what? you are soo unreasonable,damn,idiot,fucking asshole!!! You are more than a devil!I wanna poke ur face with a stone, i wanna crushed your body,grind your bones, squeeze the jelly from your tiny eyes,i wanna cut ur body into pieces..tiny little pieces where even ur soul cannot recognize it...i wanna put all those tiny little pieces into a sack and grind it..make ashes out of it that even the wind won't know it's you!YOu are nothing but a brutal fucking creature. You dont deserve to live in this world...that even ur carbon dioxide will remain useless to all living things.

      Love always hurts unexpectedly. I wonder why it hurts the same all over and over again. Picking up the pieces is something that is so hard to do. Damn!Why do i always get hurt?hmm..maybe i dont trust him a lot?or maybe i always let this damn jealousy ate the whole of me? or maybe i am too careless?or maybe he doesnt love me?whatever! All i know now is its over...he left me with nothing but tears and depression to which i,myself, created it. It is my fault actually...But can't you see?how much you really mean to me?i may not be the perfect girl in town, but all i can offer you is a love that will last long.Something that is really for keeps.. Now whats wrong? to let you go? I never meant to hurt you but i think why it come too far?Everytime i make some mistakes, All i do is play you that pushed you too far. I want you back here in my arms, i want to start all over again...i want to know if you still care?Coz i need you now...i want you back.I failed you once to make ammends.Things have been so different since you've been gone, but its hard for me to live my life..so come on out baby,coz im waiting for you..Time will come you'll see some changes but i will be a better girl. You know so clear that i still care and i will be with you until the end...I love you boy!Time will change..heal all wounds..heal all souls..heal all hearts that's been hurt by the past...All will leave a mark in our hearts.And everytime i will remember it, It's still be you that i will choose.No matter how far, no matter how painful it is, the love that you once gave and shared with me, will cure it all.

      When i feel what i feel, sometimes its hard to tell you so. You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know. There are times when i find, you wanna keep yourself from me when i dont have the strenght, i am just a mirror of what i see. how hard for me to understand so many things have taken place before this love affair began.Confusion can give way to doubt.For there are times when I fall short of what I say,i am all about.Tell me what it is. There's no need to make believe.Look beyond your own.Try and find another place for me Cause. . .at your best you are loved, you are a positive motivating force within my life. Should u ever feel the need to wonder why...let me know.

      LAst night was a real bummer! Think i slept around 3am heheheehe. I had fun chatting with some PT friends..and hey! my life revolves with my PT friends more than my real friends now hehehe weird noh? Well...slept at 3am and wake up 6:30 am...checked my computer, if there's a beast who courageously leaves a message there even if im sleeping lol. Well, no one's there...only my lexie. Got to talk to him about so many things in a span of hmm..2 hrs i think. And at last, i got to tell him of my little secret ehhehe. hey, everybody has secrets to keep right?sometimes we leave it undisclosed...sometimes we tell them even if they mean hurting them. Anyways, its just a secret you know..not fun enough to ruin one's life lolz..well, keeping a secret is totally different from lying okay? lying is more of intentional stuffy stuffy and so on and so forth...I wont tell my secrets here of course! eheheh find it out for yourself (thats for whoever reads this)...thanks alex..ur making my day!hehehe

"Friendster"! its really a yucky yucky thing hehehe.I love "Fiendster" more its the new way of meeting enemies nyahahaha.  Today, i fall inlove with Tobeey, my hero, hehehe spidey2 is really cool.
