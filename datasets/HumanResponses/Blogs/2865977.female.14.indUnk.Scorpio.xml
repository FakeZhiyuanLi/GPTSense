      I'm sorry but today I will not have jokes I have had the worst days of my life and am not in the mood to laugh but he is something I thought was just right!! One day, a man went to visit a church.  He got there early, parked his car, and got out.  Another car pulled up near and the driver got  out and said,"I always park there!  You took my place!" The visitor went inside for  Sunday School, found an empty seat and sat down.  A young lady from the church  approached him and stated,  "That's my seat! You took my place!"  The visitor was somewhat distressed  by this rude welcome, but said nothing.  After Sunday School, the visitor went  into the sanctuary and sat down.  Another member walked up to him and said,  "That's where I always sit! You took my place!"                   The visitor was even more troubled by this  treatment, but still He said nothing.  Later as the congregation was praying  for Christ to dwell among them,  the visitor stood up, and his appearance began to change.  Horrible scars became visible on  his hands and on his sandaled feet.  Someone from the congregation  noticed him and called out, "What happened to you?"  The visitor replied, as his hat  became a crown of thorns, and a tear fell from his eye,  "I took your place."   He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

Do I really deserve it!! all my life I have been worried about my friends and not myself well I'm tired of helping people and not getting help back!! I just wish I could live my live where I didn't know anyone and didn't have to go through this pain!!!

      Here's something I just thought was cute  Jesus and Satan are having a conversation...    Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who was better on his computer. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all of the bickering.  Finally God said, "Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job."   So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job. But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.   Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.   Satan started searching frantically, screaming "It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!"   Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate.   "Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?"   God shrugged and said, "Jesus saves."    He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

Dick looks at Dubya, chuckles and says, "You know, I could throw a $100.00 bill out the window right now and make one person very happy."      Dubya shrugs his shoulders and says, "Well, I could throw ten $10.00 bills out the window and make 10 people very happy." George Bush Senior says, "Of course then, I could throw one-hundred $1.00 bills out the window and make a hundred people very happy."      The pilot rolls her eyes, looks at all of them and says, "I could throw all of you out the window and make the whole country happy."

And he got his wish.  The rabbit said, "I wish I had a motorcycle to go with that helmet." And he got his wish.

      Here's another joke I just thought it was hiliarious!!! The Clever Lawyer    A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried this creative defense:  "My client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb."  "Well put," the judge replied. "Using your logic, I sentence the defendant's arm to one year's imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses."  The defendant smiled. And, with his lawyer's assistance, he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench and walked out.   He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      Here's todays' joke: Insulting Parrot    A lady was walking past a pet store when a parrot said, ''Hey, lady! You're really ugly!"  The lady was furious and continued on her way.  On the way home, she passed by the petstore again and the parrot once more said "Hey, lady! You're really ugly!"  She was incredibly ticked now, so she went into the store and said that she would sue the store and kill the bird.  The store manager apologized profusely and promised he would make sure the parrot didn't say it again.  The next day, she deliberately passed by the store to test the parrot. "Hey, lady!" it said.  "Yes?"  "You know."   He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!!

      Here's some more jokes to go with the last post Three Nuns    Three nuns decided to quit so they went to the Mother Superior and said, "We don't want to be nuns anymore, how do we quit?" The mother told them, "Do something unholy and come back here in 24 hours." So the nuns left thinking, "What can I do that's unholy?"  The next day they went to the mother one at a time. The mother said tot he first nun, "What unholy thing did you do?" and the nun said "I stole a kid's bike." The mother said, "I guess that will do, go drink some holy water. When the nun did she wasn't a nun anymore and she left the convent.   The second nun walked in and the mother said, "What unholy thing did you do?" The nun replied, "I slept with a married man!" The mother said, "Well, that's sinning. Go drink holy water."   The third nun walked in and the mother said, "What unholy thing did you do?" The third nun said proudly, "I pissed in the holy water!" God forgive me for that one!!! I thought it was funny  Republican Lightbulb Replacement Policy    How many republicans does it take to change a lightbulb?  Three. One to change the bulb, one to call the media to publicize it, and one to blame the electric bill on the democrats.  I LOVE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!(above)  Angelic Love    "My wife is an angel."  "Lucky you. Mine's still alive  HEHEHE!!! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!!

      Well here's today's joke Fun Things to Do at a Drive-Thru    1. Drive through the drive-thru in reverse and let your passenger order.  2. Ask the price of almost everything on the menu and then order something that you didn't ask the price for.  3. Tell the employee that your window is broken. Order and then pay with your door open. When the food comes, roll down the window and snatch your order from their hands.  4. Go to McDonald's and demand a big breakfast at 11:30 at night. Put up a fight.  5. Pay for a large order in pennies and nickels.  6. Order in another language. Be careful what neighborhood you're in.  7. When asked if they can take your order, tell them you are just window-shopping and drive on.  8. Laugh sadistically when asked if you would like ketchup.  9. Ask the cashier how they fit into that little box.  10. If they make you wait, make them wait when they come back on.  11. Demand to speak to the manager. When they come on, complain that you did not like the way the employee said, "May I take your order?"  12. When asked if they can take your order say, "Why, can I take yours?"  13. If they ask you to wait, order anyway and keep doing it till they yell at you.  14. Pretend your car has broken down. Ask for assistance moving it. When they come out, drive away.  15. Tell them you have to use the bathroom.  16. Order a cup of water and two napkins. That's it.  17. Don't order when they come on. Just sit there. If a line forms behind you, get out of the car and cause a scene.  18. When they hand you your food, hand them a bag with all the trash from your car in it.  19. Just stare at them when you pay and get your food. Don't break your stare.  20. Honk your horn the whole way through the line.

      I thought this was so funny I just had to put it on here now!! Sex and class    The wealthy, high-society mother of a 17-year-old girl was concerned that her daughter was having sex. Worried the girl might become pregnant, and adversely impact the family's status, she consulted the family doctor.   The doctor told her that teenagers today were very willful, and any attempt to stop the girl would probably result in rebellion. He then told her to arrange for her daughter to be put on birth control and, until then, talk to her and give her a box of condoms.   Later that evening, as her daughter was preparing for a date, the woman told her about the situation and handed her a box of condoms.   The girl started to laugh and reached over to hug her mother saying, "Oh Mom! You don't have to worry about that! I'm dating a woman!"     He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!!

      Lately God has been doing many things in my life and I'm so glad that he has been getting closer to me because I have asked for this for so many years but the devil always seemed to block him out of my life some how! But finely it happened, God has talked to me and now I'm helping someone else get closer to God one of my friends was struggling with her faith and I don't know where it came from but I got the strength to tell her all about God and something came out of my mouth that I didn't even know about!!! See you guys with Gods help he will get you through any situation weather it is helping your friend getting closer to God or if your just walking to school and want him to help you get there safely he's always there!! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      Todays Joke:                     GOT ANY GRAPES A duck walks into a bar and asks, "Got any grapes?"  The bartender, confused, tells the ducks that no, his bar doesn't serve grapes. The duck thanks him and leaves.   The next day, the duck returns and says, "Got any grapes?"   Again, the bartender tells him that, no, the bar does not serve grapes, has never served grapes, and, furthermore, will never serve grapes. The duck, a little ruffled, thanks him and leaves.   The next day, the duck returns, but before he can say anything, the bartender begins to yell: ''Listen, duck! This is a bar! We do not serve grapes! If you ever ask for grapes again, I will nail your stupid duck beak to the bar!''   The duck is silent for a moment, and then asks, ''Got any nails?''   Confused, the bartender says no.   ''Good!'' says the duck. ''Got any grapes?''  this is hilarious!!!

Suddenly, he feels a pair of hands kneading his shoulders, back, and neck. The lawyer turns around. "What the heck do you think you're doing?" "I'm a chiropractor, and I'm just keeping in practice while I'm waiting in line." "Well, I'm a lawyer, but you don't see me screwing the guy in front of me, do you?"

Bush was out jogging one morning along the parkway when he tripped, fell over the bridge railing, and landed in the creek below. Before the Secret Service guys could get to him, 3 kids who were fishing pulled him out of the water. He was so grateful he offered the kids whatever they wanted.  The first kid said, "I want to go to Disneyland." George W. said, "No problem. I'll take you there on Air Force One".  The second kid said, "I want a new pair of Nike Air Jordan's." George W. said, "I'll get them for you and even have Michael sign them!"  The third kid said, "I want a motorized wheelchair with a built in TV and stereo headset!" George W. was a little perplexed by this and said, "But you don't look like you are handicapped." The kid replied, "I will be, after my dad finds out I saved your butt from drowning!" Best One EVER!! lol He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      I just finished the best book I have ever read last night!!! The Next Door Savior!! It's an amazing book that I would recommend to anyone! My mom is going to read it next and I'm sure she too well say what an amazing book it is. It opened up my eyes to see all the amazing things that God has done for us and some of the things we haven't yet come to appreciate. You know Jesus didn't have to die on the cross for us he could have turned his cheek and just said "they don't deserve it," "All they have in there hearts is sin and nothing else." But did he?? NO!! He took those beatings and he took those nails into his flesh for us so that we could live eternally in the Kingdom of Heaven. When he was getting the beatings he could have made himself go Numb but he took the beating fully and for what?? So he could prove to all that he loved us so much every beating he took he had us in mind when he was getting nailed to the cross our names were running through his mind!! He could call us all by name but he had other plans he was to die and rise again in 3 days did he do it?? You bet he did!!! It's time for us to take a stand for our lord and Savior Jesus Christ just as he did for us! I did it, are you ready for the challenge?? I am already taking it!! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      One thing is certain. We can't ignore him. If these moments are factual, if the claim of Christ is actual, then he was, at once, man and God.  The single most significant person who ever lived. Forget MVP. He is the enitire league. The head of the parade? Hardly. No one else shares the streets. Who comes close? Humanity's best and brightest fade like dime-store rubies next to him.  Dismiss Him? We can't. Resist Him? Equally difficult. Why would we want to?  Don't we need a God-Man Savior? A just-God Jesus could make us, but not understand us. A just-Man Jesus could love us, but never save us. But a God-Jesus?   NEAR ENOUGH TO TOUCH. STRONG ENOUGH TO TRUST. A NEXT DOOR SAVIOR              FROM THE BOOK NEXT DOOR SAVIOR He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      MOM, WHAT'S IT LIKE?  When you felt the foot within your womb,   when the infant cry first filled the room...   to think that you and Heaven just circled the moon... What's it like?  And the day the bus pulled to a stop   and you zipped the jacket up to the top   and placed a kiss on a five-year-olds cheek   and waved good-bye, then saw the trike-   silent and still- What's it like?  The first time you noticed His voice was deep. The first time she asked if you were alseep   and wanted to know when love was real. And you told her. How did it feel?  Then the candles were lit. She came down the aisle. Did you weep? Did you smile? And when your child with child told you the news,   and in the quiet of the corner asked for clues. "Mom" she whispered, "what's it like?"          From the book Next Door Savior  He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      To have my voice, but have him speaking. My steps, but Christ leading. My heart, but his love beating in me, through me, with me. What's it like to have Christ on the inside?  To tap his strenght when mine expires or feel the force of heaven's fires raging, purging wrong desires. Could Christ become myself entire?  So much him, so little me that in my eyes it's him they see. What's it like to a Mary be? No longer I, but Christ in me.             From the book Next Door Savior I recommend it to all!! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! just have faith he will be there!!

I just wish I could go into a room and come out a better person!!! cause right now I feel as if I'm the worst person anyone could ever meet!!! Everyones mad at me all of a sudden!!!! I just don't now what to do  ANYMORE !! I think it's just time that I get new friends new personality new everything!!! I'm tired off all the bull!!!

      reasons people give for ignoring God and His goodness.  A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed. As the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation.They talked about so many things and various subjects.When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber said: "I don't believe that God exists."  "Why do you say that?" asked the customer. "Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God doesn't exist. Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would be neither  suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who would allow all of these things." The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn't want to start an argument. The barber finished his job and the customer left the shop. Just after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the  street with long, stringy, dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked dirty and unkempt. The customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he said to the barber: "You know what?  Barbers do not exist."  "How can you say that?"  asked the surprised barber. "I am here, and I am a barber. And I just worked on you!" "No!" the customer exclaimed. "Barbers don't exist because if they did, there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, like that man outside." "Ah, but barbers DO exist! What happens, is people do not come to me." "Exactly!"- affirmed the customer. "That's the point! God, too, DOES exist! What happens, is, people don't go to Him and do not look for Him. That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."  He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he proposes!! He makes no mistakes!! Just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      Into the Darkness   I wish I could pick up my head and face the world head on. I wish the in these things instead I had somewhere to place my feet on. They want to go foreward but the world is a scary place Compelled to do the right things all under my mask of my happy face. Everywhere I turn it seems to be my fall rocks, pits and perilous things Everything I wanted, purposely ingnoring my call All turning away, past the dark, where I will not go.   The sunshines, yet i see all blankness nothing more dramatic than the queesiness my sickness growing with every second of quickness nothing more saddening than my sadness. Times may come, and Times may go but I can never seen to reach that even persistant goal. More lessons to learn more lessons to teach. A pool of water stands in my way and that one person stands on the other side How I tried to get them to look my way, don't blame me, for theirsake, I tried.   Consistant noises and withering confidence everyone pulling my to and away from where I want to be. I'm everywhere at everyone's dispence Just so I can see the smiles I give happily. I know God enjoys my work, I've felt it on me some Trapped in this machine of wishing wells and superstitious actions along with the crazy things this world tells. although what I wanted isn't in my grasp I continue, for their sake to weep. Although they may be telling some off hand story I still cry while I count my sheep.   Into the Darkness, I venture alongside the slight film of light, trying not to lose my way A distant voice of confidence, helps me everyday Preparing me for the long and lonely ride.   They mean so much to me I only wish they knew Because when I was around them The sky was a different blue. But now, my sky is a turbulent black. And all seems to cover all of me. But I can't get off track Have to watch in front of me. Tried and true applications are no use here, I am only, left with nothingness and there is no possble excuse Venture on, Into the Darkness... Dedicated To Melissa DeJesus - 2/27/2004 Michael J. Mayo  He wrote this after something happened that tore my heart apart He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!!

      Well hey guys today has been going good so far but I just figured something out today the guy that I really like likes one of my friends!!!!! Now I know I have no chance with him but really all I can say is that I hope she likes him back and that they get a chance to get to know each other more and at one point go out!! I know it would tear my heart apart to see them go out but really I'd rather my friends be happy then me. Yes I know weird concept but if you've been through half the things I've been through you'd understand why I do the things I do. To tell you the truth sometimes I just wonder why I was ever put here on this earth. Why did God put me here to suffer? I don't mean it because of what's happening right now with the guy I like it's just that ever since I was little there was not one day that I went in this house with out crying. There were times when I cried myself to sleep wondering why God had put me through all this misery. But now I know why, one night I asked him to talk to me and really it didn't hit me until I had to help a friend get closer to God, The reason he did that to me was so that I can help people get closer to him and show them that he was the way for everything! I'm not going to lie and say that all my saddness is gone or whatever cause it's not but really all I can do is pray to God and ask him to help me through everything and to give me the strength to carry on with my life. Some of you must think I'm crazying right now for hoping that the guy I like and one of my friends get together really I'm not cause I know that the biggest reward to my life is coming soon and only God can give me this reward! I know God is looking down on me right now and smiling and cheering me on for what I'm doing and I know he see's that I wish them not bad but good and I will get rewarded for that. I know that if they're reading this right now I know that there going to see how much I really care about there happiness I hope that one day they too well do this for me and not turn there backs on me when I need there help! Yes I will always love Josiah! But I cheerish my friends and there friendship more than anything in this world! As long as I have them both as my friend, I will be the luckiest person in the world! I'm not going to lie at all on this page so I'm going to tell the truth right now I do hope and wish that it is just rumors that he doesn't like my friend but if he does then God bless you both and that you 2 may be happy together I will never wish you guys harm in any way. I'm glad that God gave me this way of seeing things really I think this is a blessing sent from up above from the person I love the most God! God has given me this way of seeing things so I can show others that's it better to love one another and wish each the best of luck in all they do instead of wishing them hatred or dispair! I remember the first time I saw Josiah sitting with my brother in church I turned around I looked at him and I don't know what caught my eye the way he smiled or just the way he loved God! I really don't know and I probably won't ever know but God put this feeling in my heart for a reason and I will keep praying that one I would know why this feeling is in my heart. Everytime I see him I seem to get something in the pit of stomache as if Butterflies were just set loose in my stomache and playing a little game of catch. I really do hope that one I will get the chance to get to go out with Josiah and that he sees me for who I am! I know I'm the prettiest girl in this world I'm probably not even pretty at all. But I see myself as a unique person and am proud of what I have become. I look back at things I have done in my life yes I do regret somethings but I know that that's what got me here to be the person that I am today. I have gotten many times from people that I care more about others than myself I have come to realize that now but I don't regret it one bit because I don't need to worry about myself cause while I'm helping my friends there's someone up above sending down some blessing to me and watching over me so that I can keep caring about my friends and not worry about myself. Sometimes at school I will give people money so they can eat lunch while I just sit there and smile and see that I put food in someones mouth that day! it's an amazing feeling to see that I helped someone! Really I would give my life for my friends even for people I don't even know! I thank God for this ability that he has given me to love people with an unconditional love!! I love everyone with all my heart and wish everyone the best and many more! Josiah I will never stop loving you and I will also never stop wishing you good luck and May God Bless you and that he helps you to minister to people through the things you love! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! Just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

      Well the end of the school year is almost here and my heart is pounding faster as the days go by. I keep thinking about next year hows it going to be not seeing my friends anymore and on the first day of school I'll be eating lunch alone as if I were a reject. Really no one understands how I feel about the whole situation to you the truth I'm scared to death I don't know what to do. I wanna go to Jefferson but in a sense I don't cause that means starting all over and alone at the same time. Before I even applied to Jefferson I asked God that if there was a reason for me to go to Jefferson then he would let me get accepted and sure enough I was. I pray and hope that I would make friends and may them be just as fun and great as my friends now. I never have really told my friends what they mean to me but now I am. My friends are like the family I get to choose, some of them I love as if they were my own blood. There's not one time that I don't pray for them even if I'm mad at them I still pray for them and I never have wished the bad. I just pray that next year they can find some great friends but in the end that they never forget me. The worst thing that could happen is that I call them and I tell them who I am and that they can't even remember me. I wish everyone the best of luck next year and May God bless you all!!  He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! Just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!
