      Here's how my past two days went. On the same night that I got sick, Crys and I got into a misunderstanding and we both lost sleep over it. Anyway, yesterday, I decided that I wanted to surprise her, so I did with a dozen roses. Seeing her smile yesterday definitely made my week. We wanted to see if they could come over for a while, but Krissy's brother was being a tard, so she got mad and decided not to go. Because Krissy backed out, Crys did too. After that we came home and were all bummed out for a while, I was a bit pissed at first but then I talked to Crys on the phone so my little frown was turned upsidown. Manzie and I were sent to pick up Deryl a little later, and when we got home, we had a huge surprise... they were here! They ended up spending the night, which I am glad they got to. Crys also bought me a stuffed cat, a card, and a balloon, which I thought was really nice of her. The contents of the card brought me to tears I have to admit. Went to work for the first time this week. I won't be bringing home much this week. Oh well, I only have two things I need to get; a phone for my room and two t-shirts for Seth. I have a feeling I may get him another article of clothing instead though, something he actually needs, like pants. That's aboot it.

      The party last night was great, as was Crystal's graduation. Speaking of which, have I mentioned how extremely proud of her I am? Well, I am. After adding Crys to our car we picked up Krissy and went to Rent-a-Center. Walter took forever as usual. After that we went to my house for a bit, where we met up with Manzie. As for the party... got to see a lot of old faces, and Crys got to meet more of my family. Uncle Mark didn't even recognize me, and Barb said I used to be a fat boy, which I took a little offense to, but she had a point. My grandma had to go to the hospital though, she was doing better today, thank God. I ran faster snd hsrder than I had ever thought I could when I heard about that. Too bad I'm not in school anymore, I could've done track... inside joke, if you don't know, don't ask. Krissy left us after a while, which sucked, but she didn't want to feel all third wheelish... I think if she had stayed she would've had a lot of fun with everyone and we would've been there all night. Crys' ears started acting up so we sat in the shed during fireworks. I didn't mind missing them for her. There was a stray one this year that shot into the woods. After that, we had some fun talking to John and Sue, as well as Scott. Seth came down too for a little while. I was a bit irritated that he had waited that long, but at least he was there long enough to say hi. After the party we came home which although I wanted to stay was good because I was getting really cold and tired, and a night in a warm bed with Crys was the perfect remedy for that. Got paid... 74 this week, I think Jess took 10 of it, but I was only half awake when she was here so I'm not sure. Oh well, 74 is good enough I guess. I think I'm going to save up for some new shiznizzy in the computer dept. I feel like total crap. I think it's from the calzone I ate today, I haven't been in very good shape since I ate it... ricotta cheese kills my digestive system. I have a feeling for the next day or two it's going to be a cycle of cramping, bad stomach pain, the runs, fever, and soreness. Earlier when we were at Krissy's I got hit with it really hard, and all at once too. It started off as just a cold chill, but as soon as we got inside and the atmosphere and temperature changed, it started feeling like I was being stabbed. Until we got about halfway home I was having trouble breathing because of it. I haven't had breathing problems since, but the pain in my stomach has only gotten worse. Anyway, I think I have work tomorrow morning, so I'm going to go to sleep now. Goodnight.  Mood: Despite being sick, I still got to see Crys, so that makes one big smile on this face.

      Tomorrow is both Crystal's graduation and the annual Morey 4th of July party. Here's how the day is going to go... First I'm going to go to Crys' graduation. I'm so proud of her, all getting out of school and stuff. Then, it's off to the party. I'm really excited about that because I get to see a lot of people I haven't seen since last year, and Crys gets to meet that side of my family, which is cool too. Can't wait to see the annual events take place; fireworks, a few games off horse shoes, Barb plastered off of her ass, everyone else drunk, etc. Talked to Ryan again tonight. I'm still not Jeff Peek. Just thought I'd let you know. Anyway, I gotta go, so bye.  Mood: Depressed, but excited.  Currently Listening To: Silence.

      Updating this is really a bitch. Monday I finally got to meet the legendary Micah.. he's a cool guy. Him and his cousin Blake(whom I've seen at the school many times) helped me and the G man with hay on Monday, then Monz and I yesterday. We finally made it to the roof of the barn. Crys and I weren't doing great, but it's resolved now I hope. I get to see her today.. I'm more than excited about that. Her and I are going to... :o talk. There's a lot of stuff that I wasn't wanting to tell her a while ago, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to, then the more I needed to. It'll be better to get it all off of my chest. Losing weight... I'm down to about 175. I was 210 at the beginning of the year. My exercise program is working out great. Well that's aboot it, I'll be back later today, or tomorrow even.

      Yesterday I went up to Krissy's house with Manz. I was really glad to see Crys. We went swimming, then Crys had to go. Her and Krissy got into a tiny spat, and she didn't seem too happy after that. I didn't get a hug or anything and I was really depressed. To this very second, I'm still depressed. I put a grin on though for a while, and hung out with Manzie and Krissy. I'll admit I had fun, but I would've rather have had my girlfriend with me. I just like spending time with Crys and find her to be better company than anyone else. No one else even comes close to comparing to her when it comes to people I'd like to spend time with. Even if we're just laying there, I'd still rather be with her than doing anything with anyone else. Even if she was in a bit of a bad mood, that doesn't matter to me. It's a rarity that anyone can truly piss me off, even less often for her. She's only made me really mad once in eight months. I'd rather spend my time with a Crys in a bad mood than to not be spending time Crys at all. That's how important the time I spend with her is, I'd even be willing to do it through her worst moods. Anyway, I talked on the phone to her a little bit ago, and I'm glad I did. I missed her a lot after she left. After she was gone, Krissy, Manz, and I went out for a drive to a store, where I got the citrus kind of Jolt. Yeah, needless to say I was a little more than hyper. If you thought I was a dork normally, you haven't seen anything until you see me on Jolt. Anyway, I'm going to sleep, goodnight.  Mood: Tired Currently Playing: Nothing but z's soon hopefully.

      Yup, I stayed at Crystal's last night. Well, Krissy and I both did. I had a great time. There was a point when I was being an idiot though. Crys kept saying that I didn't love her anymore. We both know it isn't true, and I know she was only kidding, but for some reason I took it personally and turned into a complete ass over it. Anyway, it was resolved, and I got to spend the rest of the night with her in my arms. Oh, I almost forgot... her sister came over when Almanzo was there. Manzie and I had to hide in the closet for almost a half hour for her to leave. Anything for Crys though, including a mildly comical wait in a closet. Yeah, Manz and I were about ready to hop out of the closet and ask for a hug or something as long as she was kicking her shoes off and staying for a while. Earlier, we woke up, which when she is there is always worth mentioning. Then Manz came, and we all went over to Krissy's to go swimming. That was fun too. Was a tad cold though, but it was worth it. After that, Almanzo and I went to McDonalds and then to his house for a bit, before I returned home. When I got here, the G man had a surprise for me... my pay from Butch. I got 95 dollars this week, but since I had to pay Walter 20 and my mom 5, I only have 70 to spend. Well, I'm tired.  Current Mood: Depressed, I miss Crys like there's no tomorrow.

      Yeah, I said I was going to type again after, I lied, big whoop. Work was easy yesterday, and this morning I wasn't hurting when I woke up. We had some heavy ass bails today though. I thought I was gonna die. Russ was helping us today, which was a help; until his ass took a break. After a half hour he looks down from the hay mound and with a dumbfounded look on his face, stares at my half dead body, and asks me if I need help... oi vay. That urked me a little, but I went easy on him and didn't say anything because Butch had verbally torn him a new asshole before. Got to talk to Crys on the phone twice today, I'm feeling like hot shit. Her graduation was good, and whether she wants to admit it or not, she deserved to be up there, and she most definitely deserved the presents we gave her for getting up there. G man didn't go as everyone had thought he wouldn't. I got two hugs, which was good. Crystal's brother got to meet my family, if that is of any importance. Get to see Crys tomorrow, I'm so excited!!! I can't wait to give her a huge hug. Anyway, I'm tired, night night.  Current Mood: Tired with the feeling that I'll be sleeping easy tonight. Currently Playing: Some beat; I was writing.

      Just got back from Wal-Mart. Fun trip. I got a new shirt and some socks out of it, so I'm not complaining. I'm hoping I get paid tonight so that I can buy Crys something for her Votech graduation tonight. The G man is supposed to go too, but I guess he just decided not to. One load today that I know of at work. I have to go at 4:00. I think Manz and I can handle it alone, but some help definitely wouldn't hurt. I think today is going to be my last day there, but I'm not sure yet. My mom said it was, but who knows. I've decided that I'm going to go with Springer for my next rant. Well, I'm going to go now, I'll write again maybe when I get out of work, and if not then, then after Crystal's graduation thing. I get to go up to Fonda to see it. Yay! I don't know what my fascination with that school is, but the memories, both good and bad, all hit me at once when I go there. Anyway, goodbye for now.  Current Mood: Overjoyed, I get to see Crys tonight!!! Maybe tomorrow too. Currently Playing: Pillar - Fireproof

         Got home, ate, showered, and here I am. Work was good today. Still a little tiring, but not nearly as energy draining as yesterday. We only did five loads, one of which was just me and Manzie. The 2nd Butch helped us with, then we got help again for the third and fourth with Butch and another guy(I think his name is Justin, but I'll get back to you on that), and then the G man(I can say his name without saying his name, did somebody say McLoophole?) helped the four of us with the last load, which was by far the heaviest so I'm pretty glad he showed up when he did.    I'm not as much of a fatass as I used to be. I'm only down to about 181 now, as opposed to the 210 I was at the beginning of the year. Fuck Subway, the daily dosage of stupid diet works great, I get it enough from some of the stuff on tv. That reminds me, the G man and I were watching tv today and Jerry Springer comes on. They have some chick bitching about how she cheated on her husband with his best friend because he doesn't know how to kiss and he has teeth missing. Whoopee. It's not like her gargantuan ass could have set her standards higher and got better anyway. I think I'm going to do a rant about Springer soon. He's had one coming for a long time. I don't hate his show; it's highly entertaining, but the guests he has are so stupid they can't be real, can they?    Where'd the time go? It's 10:52 now. I just got done on the phone with Crys not to long ago. I love talking to her. She's at her aunts again, which means that until Wednesday I can talk to her. I'm going to her graduation ceremony for Votech after work tomorrow. We only have one load tomorrow according to Butch, so it shouldn't be long before I'm home so I can get ready.    Well, I'm tired, and I'm missing the last of RAW. Goodnight, people.  Current Mood: Tired, but still happy because I got to talk to Crys. Currently Playing: Nothing, but I was listening to Trik Turner a while ago if that counts for anything.

         Welcome to my blog. From now on this will replace my "my week" section. It's easier, and I'll be able to post in it more often... maybe even every day. I can tell that you're enthused. I'll do the 'mood' and 'currently playing' thing too I suppose in honor of bloggityness. Sounds fun, right? Anyway, have a nice day, I'll probably post again after I get out of work.

      Well, Crys has a pretty good account of what's been happening in our lives lately, so check out her  urlLink last post  to see that... Anyway, I didn't make much money this week, and I'm thinking it's almost time for me to start on my hunt for a less temporary job. As much as I like the flexibility of Butch, I also have the problem of not being needed, which leaves my wallet kind of empty. That sucks major balls. So, I dunno what I'm gonna do about that yet. Going to the Great Escape Wednesday, I'm really excited. I haven't been there in years, but I couldn't have better people to go with really. It's going to be me, Krissy, G, Monz, and Crys(ah, every time I think of that name I do something very dirty... just kidding; it's only sometimes.) Well, Crys is laying down, and she looks lonely, so I'm going to go change that.  Mood: Happy :D> Currently Playing: Some beat.    ..:..:Matt:..:..

      I went up and apologized to Crys today, thankfully she accepted. That's why I love her, no matter how many times I fuck things up, she's always willing to give me another chance. That doesn't mean I can fuck up whenever I want, so I'm going to lay off of that for a while, like forever if I can. On the way home Monz and I stopped to Wal-Mart so I could buy condoms; I was fresh out. Anyway, I go through the self checkout(I have a huge fear of humiliation when it comes to buying things, especially rubbers.), and then walk out when the security thing goes off. The first time it ever goes off for me and THOSE had to be in the bag. My face turned red as the strawberry raincoat inside(they're flavored and scented :-)>, big up for Crys). Hopefully I can get Thursday off so I can go to Great Escape with G, Krissy, Monz, and Crys. If not, then there's still the rest of the summer to go I guess. Well, I gotta wait for G to get home so I can tell him to call the girls, I might write again later.  Mood: Happier than I've been in a long time.

      Today isn't a good day to be me. I said some shit on here last night(which has now been deleted) that made everyone upset. I mean, I can't help it if I feel like I don't belong, I'm just not used to hanging around with people like them, who actually give a crap about me. Like I said in my second post last night, I'm the only one who separated myself from them, and I realize that now. I'm sickly today. It might have come from sitting outside in the rain until 3:30 this morning sulking. At least I didn't hit anything. I will admit that a lot of things I said last night were pretty uncalled for, and my only defense was that I hadn't gotten much sleep the night before, then had to work twice, so I was super cranky.&nbsp;I apologize to anyone offended by something I said now that I have my head out of my ass. Well, Almanzo's here now, so I'm going to go hang out with him for a while, maybe it'll make me feel better, although I deserve what I've got now.

      As I type this I'm explaining to Sarah that everyone is indeed Dutch in the area... I've had too much Mountain Dew again and I'm starting to think weirdly. We went to work twice today, and I got paid. 123, 23 of which is on it's way to the bank. We did a truck today in the afternoon after doing some wet hay in the morning. I am completely burnt out right now. Sarah and I just got to talking about my new job... mattstreet: Hmmmm, I wonder if Stephen Hawking needs to wear adult diapers Sarah 1234567: i think so mattstreet: and if so, who has to change them? Sarah 1234567: hehe Sarah 1234567: his wife ? mattstreet: hmmmm, I'm not thinking so mattstreet: she might not take shit(literally) from that job Sarah 1234567: hehe Sarah 1234567: im thinking he pays someone millions to do it for him Sarah 1234567: would u do that for millions of $'s ? mattstreet: hmmmm mattstreet: without hesitation mattstreet: I'd hire someone else to do it for less Sarah 1234567: hehe mattstreet: so I can keep my millions and not have to be stuck in shitty situations Sarah 1234567: lol Sarah 1234567: but who would u pay to do that ? Sarah 1234567: and dont look at me mattstreet: some immigrant from a latino country fresh off the raft looking for a job Sarah 1234567: hehe Sarah 1234567: u have it all planned out mattstreet: yup Yeah... we're screwed up. Anyway, back to talking about my actual job. The truck we did today was different from the ones we usually do. We stacked six tears high and the truck just barely made it out of the barn we loaded it in. It took over an hour to get the tarps tied on. Also, I found out today that Adam ran a guy over, not cool, and that Blake has a thing with heights too, which made me a little more comfortable with that knowing that I'm not the only one. I miss Crys so much right now. She called for me earlier but I was in the shower, so I think I missed out on talking to her for the night, which blows total ass. Anyway, I think I bored Sarah to death, so I'm going to go and try to liven up our conversation... Stephen Hawking's shit is only interesting for so long, and I think we've pretty much driven the topic as far into the ground as it'll go  Mood: Tired, bored, things would definitely be better if Crys were in my arms.

      I had a good day today. First I got to wake up next to Crys for the second day in a row... how great is that? I was smiling like crazy this morning. Anyway, when G man(who threw his back out, I&nbsp;wish him a speedy recovery)&nbsp;and I got home from doing hay with Monz(who had to pick his mom up and didn't get to see Krissy today, I feel really bad for him), they were about to leave. It sucked, but I was just glad I got to see them today. We were talking about the both of them moving in last night, and the more I think about that idea, the better it seems to me. But, onto the rest of my day. I went to sleep not long after they left, and woke up a little after one. I listened to beats for the next couple hours and had no crative spurs. Then Almanzo walked in and asked me if I wanted to go milk with him... I said I would and the rest is history. I figured out that I have a huge phobia of cows, or at least being kicked. I would say that I did ok for a dopey Fonda kid's first time out. Almanzo was right though, Russ goes right for the shovel when it comes to keeping the bovine in line(rhyming... where was that at 2:30 today?). Anyway, I've had a long day, and I'm tired as hell. Goodnight.  Mood: Happy, I got to see Crys again. Currently Playing: Nothing, Manz is watching a movie in my bedroom though.

      Crys went home&nbsp;a few hours ago and it sucks that she isn't here anymore... she kept my sanity in tact and now Walter has me a bit pissed because all of a sudden his laundry is supposed to be what I revolve my life around. Fuck that. I do my own damn laundry and the only time I ever worry about someone else's is when I need to get mine in, a time in which I move their stuff to the dryer, and the stuff in the dryer to a basket. When they need to use it do they run my shit through the cycle? Of course not. They sit and bitch and moan until my clothes are out of the washer, a task which is done by me. So yeah, while I may not give a rat's ass about anyone else's clothes, at least I make a fucking effort to see to it that things are getting done. Anyway, stupid family quarrels aside, I was glad she came over, but we had a few fights while she was here. Those are starting to occur more often, and that scares me. I hate fighting with her. However, I did have a great time nonetheless. I also got some good news today, but I'm not at liberty to say what that is really. Just know that it made Crystal and I quite relieved. We've been doing straw at work lately... I'm ready to go back to hay. Straw stacks crappy and it's harder to get into the twine. I am STUFFED. First we went to McDonalds when we took Deryl to work and the girls home. Then, Manz and I went to BK and tried the Angus... hella good sandwich, but I feel like I'm going to puke from eating so much.  Anyway, I'm tired, going to sleep. Night.

      Despite it being under crappy circumstances, I actually did have some fun for Gram today. I kept everyone's spirits up with my accents. There was a lot of anti-gay humor, but it was all in good fun. I hung out with Scott a lot today. This was the first time we've really bonded in a while, which is cool. We've gotta do it more often. I also played horse shoes with Scott twice. First we played against John and a guy named Mark(who we nicknamed Lifetime on account of the fact that he watches women's television). We lost. The next game was against Nate and Margaret's boyfriend Casey(who by the way is a very cool guy, good pick on her part). We didn't lose by much. Scott and I also went to Wal-Mart. The funeral however wasn't so happy... I broke down when I got to the coffin again. Saying goodbye for the last time wasn't something I ever wanted to do. It was weird walking into the house later and not finding her sitting in her chair. Not having Grandma around is going to take a lot of getting used to. Crys can't call me, which pisses me off a bit, but I guess it isn't her fault. I want a day to myself with her not long after she gets back. Her and I have only had a few of those days in the nine months we've dated, and I think I want quite a few more in the future. It's weird, but I've managed better than I thought I would without her here. I feel single though, and it sucks. I want her back damnit. Oh well, about three days now. Well, I need to go to sleep, I got work at Butch's in the morning, and I may or may not be milking with Monz.  Mood: Happy for my good time I had today in her honor.

      My day couldn't get any worse. When I walked in the door after work today John told me that my grandmother had stopped breathing and they brought her over to St. Mary's to try to get her breathing again. In other words she's pretty much dead right now. I hope to God that she comes out of this alright. On top of that, Crys pretty much hates me. I can't really blame her, I've been a really big asshole over the past few days. However, G man has plans for just the three of them so I can't see her today, and it was my last chance to make things right in person before she left for Lake George, so I might not be able to make things right with her for over a week, which kills me even more. I need her so badly right now it isn't funny. I can't type anymore. &nbsp; Mood: About ready to end my suffering.

      Tonight Crys showed me exactly how much faith she has in me, and it's pretty disappointing. She sat on the phone tonight throwing it in my face again and again how I was going to hit&nbsp;something again. Maybe if the only person I've ever let give me moral support would actually believe in me for once I'd get shit accomplished, huh? Well, fuck it, I'm not waiting to get her support anymore on this subject, because she's always going to think that I'm going to hit a wall again. I actually thought about doing it out of spite tonight, but I'm not doing it. It's obvious that she may be expecting me to do it, but I'm not going to allow myself. Like the drug situation, I've got to stop depending on other people to prevent me from doing this and actually get off my lazy ass and do something about it myself. Just like drugs, this is one thing that isn't fucking happening again, especially since I'm not just letting it slide again. I'm going to start watching over all my flaws. Crys nor anyone for that matter should have to look after me to make sure I'm not doing stupid shit, and they won't have to now. I don't need a babysitter.  I'm sorry about that last paragraph, it just hurts to know that she thinks I'm going to do it again. I mean, I could sit there and say over and over again when she talks about not getting drunk again, "Until the next time you do it," but I don't. It's discouraging and it would make her feel&nbsp;as if I didn't trust her and/or was waiting for her to do it again,&nbsp;and she'd go off and do it if I kept saying that over and over. Just knowing that I did it is bad enough. I know I did something stupid, and I already feel shitty enough about it. You don't need to rub my face in it again every five seconds. I just need to be alone right now. &nbsp; Mood: Hurt like no tomorrow, physically and mentally.

      Yeah, I've realized that I've been a dumbass as of late. Not just today, but yesterday too. I guess I was just depressed&nbsp;because I know I'm going to miss Crys, and I know that I probably won't see her for a week and a half, which blows chunks. The fact that Walter went batshit on me didn't help. I got to talk to Sarah for the first time since she left for Germany today. She said she had a lot of fun on her trip and got to go to a strip club. That made me laugh, which in turn cheered me up a bit. She passed all of her exams too, which I knew she could do. The only thing still keeping me sad&nbsp;is the fact that I let Crys down. I feel like crap for breaking my promise to her. She expected me to do something and I couldn't do it. Well, I'm done hitting myself. FOR GOOD. Violence isn't the answer to anything. I realized in my thinking that it's stupid, pointless, and I'm not the only person I hurt when I do it. Everyone around me is affected, especially Crys and my mom, and when that happens, it's time to stop. It's pretty weird how I stopped hurting myself today.&nbsp;A simple image made me stop and think about what I was doing to myself. It was one of the prom pictures, and she was looking at the camera when it was taken. I broke down when I saw those eyes staring at me.&nbsp;It hit me like a ton of bricks that I hurt her more than I hurt myself when I hit things. Then I went into the bathroom and looked into my own eyes and saw how dark they were, and that scared me. I remember yesterday morning they were almost a greenish color and I was as happy as could be. But yeah, I'm done. I'm done hurting myself, and even more importantly I'm done hurting Crys. I love her, and it's about time I start proving that. What I've done is not only unethical, it's childish, not to mention self-centered. &nbsp; Well, I've stuff to do, so I'm going to go do it. I'll type again tomorrow after work.

      I sat down and thought for a while this afternoon. I tried to think about everything about myself that I actually like... and you know what? I was left completely thoughtless. Every thing that came to mind was a flaw. There is nothing right with me personality wise. I'm a prick who cares about only himself. It's a rarity that I put anyone else's needs over my own. If the amount of an asshole a person was determined their social status, I'd rule the world. I loathe everything that I am. I can't even keep one simple promise to Crys. I told her I wouldn't hit anything anymore, and I've been beating the shit out of myself all day. Fucking retard I am. I deserve it. Anyway, I'm going to huddle in a corner or play in traffic or something.  Mood: Depressed beyond belief. I make goths look uppity. Currently Playing: Impaled Nazarine - The Endless War

      I hate myself for today. I hate myself for everything I've ever done. I'm ashamed of who I am and what I represent, and am completely insecure about every little thing to the point where it makes me an annoying prick. I seriously don't know what Crys sees in me, or how she can stand being seen with me.   Anyway, here's what happened to put me in the so loving mood that I'm currently in. I went to Schenectady with Crys, Krissy, and Almanzo yesterday. I actually had a great time, despite being hit in the head more times than I could handle. When we got back to Krissy's, I finally called home and Walter completely bitched me out for not calling sooner although I didn't have access to a phone... I was pissed when I got off the phone and started acting like a complete dick. I didn't even give Crys a hug goodbye, and she did nothing to me. I feel so horrible. G man is calling Krissy's house, he said "Git r done!!!" I have no idea why. He just called his mom's too. Funny stuff. Anyway, I've gotta go, I don't know where, but anywhere but here is good.

      It was me, G, Blake, and Micah. G and I were on the wagon and we were done at 11:45. We had three loads and the elevator snapped. Not coolo. I did manage to take a broken link though as a souvenir.  The girls want us to come up today. It kills to know I can't go. I have to take my grandma to Tops tonight. For those who don't know, Tops is a group that centers it's focus on weight loss. I don't think I have work tomorrow, which is good for both me and Butch's wallet. I have a feeling I'm breaking 100 this week. I'll probably keep half to spend and put the rest in savings. I still have $33 from last week and the one before. The Six Flags commercial with the dancing old man is on... I want to adopt him. Old people are just cute. Well, I'm all cold and I can't stop shaking, so I'm going to go hop in the shower.

      I miss her too much already. I have a feeling a trip out there is going to happen tomorrow, but you never know. Work was ok today, but it was tiring. I think we're done in the home barn, and we're over to Kruegers on 30A now. It's a lot easier to work over there, more space. Today we were all saying "Get 'er done!" I don't know why, but we just found it funny I guess. We even had Micah saying it. Speaking of which, he, Almanzo, and I got to work with the Rich I was hearing about. He's a cool guy, and Manz was right, he will get right on the wagon and work with you. Well, I'm gonna go pick up Seth with my mom, I'll type again later.

      There's a hole in my wall. Yeah, last night I was a total turd bomb, that's all I really want to say about that. Went to the reunion today, it was quite boring, but Crys kept me company, so things weren't as bad as they could've been. We played Uno and badminton. Actually, come to think of it, despite the boredom, I still had a good time. Monz informed us that Krissy's stomach hurts, and he thinks she has appendicitis. Having gone through that, I hope it isn't the case, and it's got me pretty worried because if she does, the next few weeks are going to blow like no tomorrow for her. We washed the van last night, and went to Burger King. It was a good time, and Seth has the Spider Man game at BK figured out. For five bucks I could probably share the secret ;). Anyway, I'm tired, and I have work tomorrow, so I'm going to go.  Mood: Happy, got to spend the whole day with Crys :-D Currently Playing: Dope - Now or Never

I'm going to be stuck at Caroga Lake all day by myself with absolutely nothing to do but swim, and I'm not exactly the biggest fan of that. There aren't even going to be any fireworks tonight, what a jip. Maybe I'll have fun, who knows. Anyway, I need to go shower, I'll probably write again when I get home.

      I went to Crystal's graduation party with Manz today, and I had a lot of fun. Got to see my honey, so I'm happy. I played volleyball a few different times today, even if I didn't do much, it was still fun. I got to talk more with some of her relatives, I'm starting to really feel comfortable around them. Also, over the past few days I've found that it's only her aunt, also named Crystal, and her immediate family that work at Amsterdam Printing with my aunt Carrie. I probably shouldn't have taken her so seriously. Got to see baby pictures... she looked just as cute then as she does now. :) After that, the four of us, and Ryan and Phil, two of Crys' Votech friends went to Krissy's house and went swimming. I've learned that after the hay we did yesterday, I am now void of any fear I previously had... those last two loads were some scary shit. I was able to jump over a banister on the side of the pool deck to a ten foot drop, then do a kangaroo hop on one foot which led to a tumble backward in the grass down a hill, get up, and not even be phased. I normally would have come close to shitting myself. Anyway, Ryan and Phil eventually left, those two are nice guys, and Ryan looks quite a bit like my friend Craig to me, but I had forgotten to ask if they were related. Oh well. We went inside after they left, and Krissy's dad had some not so great things to say to Crys, which got me a little mad, but I think I got it through her head that he was wrong. Lately she's been showing a lot more appreciation for my being with her, and I like that. It makes me happy to know that I make her happy. When we got home, I had a pepperoni sub, and a soda from the newer machine outside... I haven't had a soda that cold in a very long time... it cools them to the point where they're just about to freeze. Tomorrow I get to go to the lake... I'm excited about going, but a little disappointed that Crys didn't want to go. I'll get over it when I get there I suppose.  Mood: Depressed; I miss Crys, but thinking back on today definitely brings a smile to my face. Currently Playing: Tenacious D - Tribute

      Krissy, her mom, and Crys all came over to talk to my mom about the ongoing struggle, but I guess she didn't want Jean in the room or something, I dunno, I think everyone is taking the wrong approach to this, and none of the things done have been in the intrest of the happiness of Krissy and Almanzo. It's all about the fact that she's not a whore and someone said she is. I think if that person wants to think that, fine, even if that person is wrong. That's why there's chocolate  and  vanilla; because you like crappy ice cream. Personally I believe that the mothers of the two said persons dating should meet and talk, with their future son and daughter in law in presence. No Crys, no G man, no interruptions, just a talk, so they can learn more about one another. I say forgive, forget, wipe the slate clean and start over. They shouldn't have denied the statement that she was a whore, instead they should've let Jean get to know Krissy better so that she herself would know that the statement wasn't true. Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Anyway, when they came, Crys stayed, and we were originally going to bring her home later, but a thunderstorm hit and it was decided that it'd probably be best for her to spend the night. So, she put on my slacker shirt and we slept downstairs. Spending time with her is just great, and I'm glad I got to see her. She got to see me drive too. Cool beans. I get to go to her graduation party tomorrow, which will be cool. I can't wait to see her again. Went to work today... although I only worked three days this week, I should come close too 100 if I don't break it with the hours I put in. Work was hell today, but we got done pretty quickly for three guys doing 6 loads. We were averaging about two per hour and a half. Well, that's aboot it, I'll be back tomorrow with more stuffs, if not Sunday.  Mood: Happy, I got to see my Crys today! Currently Playing: Thornley - So Far So Good

      The big news of the day I guess is that Crys and Krissy are fighting. Of course G man dragged himself into it, but Almanzo and I for now have decided to stay out, and what happens over the next few days will decide where I stand in all of this... well, I know where I stand in it, but I mean to voice my opinion, and when I drop a verbal bomb, it usually blows any other arguments out of the water, so if I do get involved, positively or negatively, it will most likely be over when I'm finished. But, for now, I'm just going to keep my mouth shut for the moment. No work for the past couple days, oh well, hopefully I'll have another job soon, then I can do hay when everyone else goes back to school and make even more with two jobs. Butch is supposed to be calling me now when he needs me, which is a lot easier than having the uncertainty of not knowing from night to night, which takes a load off of my mind. I wish the stupid black and white cat around here would decide if it's coming or going... it disappears for like three days and comes back for three and it's just annoying I guess. Sarah makes more money than I do... she makes over $300 US dollars a week watching kids, which is good for her. Anyway, I'm hella tired, so goodnight.

      I just put my second show on, and I'm ready to go today. Crys on the other hand, is out cold. Have I ever mentioned how friggin adorable she is when she sleeps? Well, she is. I don't know when, but we have a truck sometime this week, which means I'll be getting paid, which is good. Since Crys didn't have fun when we went the other day, I plan on taking her to the mall sometime in the near furure and I'm saving my money for that trip. I went with her the other day to her grandparents anniversary party, that was fun, and Crys looked so overjoyed to see her family back together for the day. I've realized that her family is really cool, and she bickers with her brother like I do with Seth... it's really funny. I haven't talked to Damien in forever, now I remember why... he's bugging me like crazy right now. Speaking of people I haven't talked to, I'm talking to Sarah right now. Her and I don't talk enough, and I'm starting to miss actual intelligent conversation with people on here. Well, I gotta write my Crys a letter. Bye for now.

      Tonight we're going to Crystal's aunt and uncle's house to spend the night, then we're going to be gone all day tomorrow. I'm actually really excited, but Crys is nervous. I can see why too. Oh well, I'm sure tomorrow will go fine. Didn't go to work today. Scott and I are looking into BJ's for work... but not in a perverted way. It's a wholesale club, and it sells stuff in bulk for cheaper. It's a really cool place, and I really wouldn't have a problem working there. It'd be great, especially working with Scott. He and I have been talking a lot more lately, which has been good. Well, that's about it. Crys looks lonely, so I'm going to go keep her company. Bye for now.

      I personally had a lot of fun. Crys said that she didn't, but I know that she was just as glad as I was to get out of the house. She made my day great yet again, I haven't been really bitchy and grumpy for more than ten minutes in a while now, which is definitely a good thing. Finally went back to work Monday. That was good. Friday Scott and I are going to look into BJ's... even more importantly, Friday is Crys' birthday!!! She said she didn't want anything, but when I mentioned a few possibilities, that seemed to change. I might just buy her more than one gift. I also gotta get something for G man, although I think I know what I'm getting him too. Anyway, back to the Great Escape. It was awesome. It was mine and Crys' first time there together, and there are a lot of memories. She walked off with a sunburn today. We had some of the best chicken I've ever had, and I got to hit the Raging River a bunch of times. I also found out that nothing is free there, and that half of their payroll is fresh off of a boat from Holland. G man hit the Boomerang, and he said it was awesome, so I might just have to try it out next time... pffft! HAHAHA maybe not. If you've been reading Crys' blog, you know that she lives with me now. If not, then you know now. It makes me extremely happy. In fact, she's sleeping right now. I'm staring at her all stalker-like... she's adorable when she sleeps, all drooling and snoring... just kidding. Right now she's not making a sound. Gotta go up to Crys' aunt's house Saturday so we can go to a party the next day. Her mom is going to be there, and I might just need to see the person who created the person that makes me happy. Anyway, I gotta go for now. Bya.  Mood: Tired, yet slightly overjoyed. Currently Playing: Rage Against the Machine - Born of a Broken Man
