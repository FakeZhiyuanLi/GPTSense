      We had a fellowship with our new brothers earlier today held at Dodong's house. The new brothers started to arrive around 10:00 am, leaving little time to buy and prepare our lunch, as a result, we ate past 1:00 o'clock already.  The lunch was so very solemn, nobody talked! hehehe! anyway, it was fun and the food was great, especially the pork sinugba, prepared and cooked by Bro. Baby Rommel, it tasted like  liempo!  (expertly done bro!) After the solemn lunch (hehe), the new bros discussed things about the upcoming commitment night, which was initially agreed to be held on July 10, 2004 (pls see announcements somewhere on this page).  Our new bros is also preparing a very special surprise, so watch out for it and be there.  Here are some pictures during the fellowship:   urlLink     Kusinero de primera - bro jun   urlLink     Lunchtime!   That's it for now, til' the next post.         Kzzzzt...

      Greetings to all my brothers and sisters who are away from home!!!  The OPM was very lively tonight, lead by Bro. Dodong.   After the Praise and Worship, Bro. Opong shared to us his (kind of)sad story delivered in a lively way(what a man!).  Its about his mother diagnosed with cancer. She was treated with chemo therapy, and it was succesful. What striked me was, how they dealt the problem, they did everything they can do and leave the rest to the Lord. I felt the strong trust of her family to the Lord.  Then I came to realize that trust is an important ingredient to any kind of relationship.  Thanks bro Opong for your wonderful sharing tonight, I really got something from it.  I honor you for that bro!  Until the next post my bros & sis, I want to be with my pillow now hehehe!  God bless you all!

      Just arrived home from OPM/fellowship. The OPM was lead by Bro. Naggy.  It was attended by more or less 28 members.  After the Praise and Worship, Sister Mabelle delivered the culture talk about proper speech and Bro Anthony delivered a lively talk about giving and receiving ***** (nakalimot man ko bro! sorry:( tungod tingali ni sa batchoy hehehe!)  A fellowship followed at the city wharf.  We went to see the newly insatalled lights. It was spectacular! The cost of the lights is enough to build a shelter for the homeless! (ooops)  Then we went to Junjun's Restaurant by the Bay:) and there I ate Batchoy matched with Pan de Leche! hmmm! We went home around 11:30 pm.  After that heavy snack, i am very ready to sleep now........ zzzzzzz!

           Last saturday(june 5) we had bonding of my discussion group members with some guest brothers, my groupmate who attended were Bro. Jereme, Bro Ian, Bro Victor and the guest brothers were Bro baby Rommel, Bro msgr Nagy and Bro dondon.       It was a great fellowship with brothers.  The sea was also great because it was highest tide of the month(2.1)and addition to that I saw whales swimming around me hehehe!       Later that night, we went to sister mylene's house at mangga district for the fiesta.  We went there without changing our clothes, we smelled very salty but exotic with matching tan of baby rommel.       We will be scheduling another fellowship next month, just watch for it if you wanna experience the best fellowship!       Lingkod's first, lingkod's best! (ALA BCCTV)

      We definitely need a new microphone...  The OPM held earlier was lead by brother Mark, eventhough the mic was faulty, it was still nice because everyone sang well:) It started a little bit late.  After the OPM, we had a fellowship, first at Shanghai Bay then we proceeded to Sister Malou's House (plenty of food hehehe). A dispededa party was held for Bro. Nikoy, whom will be leaving tommorow for the U.S. Bro. Nikoy is the brother-in-law of Bro. Dodong. There we all had a great time, we were also introduced to former members of Lingkod (they all moved forward). While the older members were reminiscing past memories, we were singing videoke (and lots of burping hehe). We wrapped up at around 1:00 AM.  Till' then... Good Night and God bless!

      The OPM was great, lead by Bro. Dodong.&nbsp; Only a few members attended.  A teaching by Ma'am Ines Mitra followed.&nbsp; When I listened to Ma'am Ines,&nbsp;I felt several years younger because&nbsp;I was thinking I was in high school! Sitting beside me was Bro. Regel, I'm sure he felt the same too! hehehe!&nbsp;The teaching was about their organization in school, the "J.O.Y. Circle". JOY stands for Jesus, Others and You.&nbsp; Its a charity organization aimed&nbsp;to the less fortunate students of HNU.&nbsp; She teaches us about the joy of giving.&nbsp;Eventually, it became&nbsp;their passion, a passion to give love, not just material things.  After the teaching, Bro. Rey shared his very touching near-death experience.&nbsp; It surely moved everybody.&nbsp; At 17, he suffered a stroke that nearly took his life and leaved him a semi-paralyzed body.&nbsp; He told us how he prepared&nbsp;if death will take him, how he talked to God and how he survived his ordeal.&nbsp; His testimony clearly reminds us to maintain a healthy link with God.&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, if you happen to meet Bro. Rey, ask him to tell you this story and surely you will be moved and be inspired.  Til next week for another OPM and another blessing...  See you then... God&nbsp;Bless!!

       WHAT A NIGHT!!!!   After the Commitment Ceremonies, fun-filled activities followed.  Its a night worth remembering. Everyone came well prepared, specially the old servants' wacky presentation. The presentation was a first for me, dancing infront of an audience, hehehe! It was fun! I enjoyed it very much! I hope everyone does.  The games prepared by the new servants was also very nice, I had fun walking on the cartons, it tested my balancing skills, hehe. Its also physically very strenous, it made my stomach churn, hehe...  Talking about stomach, the dinner was very delicious, from Chowking. Finally, I've already eaten what I used to see on tv, Chinese food on cartons, hehe!  VERY DELICIOUS!  There was also empanadas and fried chicken prepared by the sisters, very delicious too!  The only flaw was, not much pictures were taken. Bro. Dodong's camera ran out of battery and Bro. Junjun's camera ran out of film. :-(  May the enthusiasm we felt and showed tonight be also present in the upcoming activities of Lingkod. Till then....  God Bless!

      Hello again Bros and Sis! Sorry, I got no post about last week because I was absent.  Tonight, we had a first friday mass celebrated by Fr. Skelton, and as usual, he delivered a very lively mass.  The homily of fr. Skelton was very beautiful, it was about God's calling to him.  After the OPM, the sisters went to Loay for an overnight at sister Grace's house (i missed what's the activity hehe).   urlLink     Sis Mylene - National Women's Moderator    urlLink     Bro.

      Yes!  It was a very good mass indeed!  The celebrant was Fr. Edwin Semblante ( ? i'm not sure with his family name ).  It was a very unique & special mass because of his homily.  His short hour-long homily was delivered in a very simple way and very often with a humor.  Funny, simple and clear...  He started the homily with a campaign to join his congregation, then followed by the prayer of shepherding, then by the teaching about loving God above all things and finally the teaching about exposing ourselves to the Lord.  We certainly learned new things from Fr. Edwin.  'Till then......  God bless!   zzzzzzzZZZZZZ..... :)
