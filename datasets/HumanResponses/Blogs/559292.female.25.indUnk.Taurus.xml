      i took kai for a walk this evening around 7pm.  as we neared the park, i noticed tiny little flashes of light.  to my surprise, i realized that lightning bugs had come to north florida. ^_^

      i have an hour and a half before i head off to work.   i need to make time to organize and clean out my room.  (not to metion the living room)  i hope to have my web page done soon.  it looks pretty good.  at some point i'm going to have to learn some javascript or php to develope my site properly.    someday...someday

      i've noticed i have an incredibly hard time making decisions on what to name things.  my website, my blog, my characters for RPGs.  choosing a specific name takes time.  there's a wealth of information that comes to you when see or hear a name.  a title is important when you want people to remember it.   it's terribly late and i must be getting to bed.  (even though i don't have work 'til noon tomorrow)  damn...i just realized i missed sunday night's broadcast of nero wolfe.  i really like that show.  it seems to be set in the '40s with fat man who likes to solve mysteries.  not unlike poirot, but better and american. ^_~ anyway...i did see crank yankers on sunday, so it wasn't too bad.  can't wait for it's next episode.

      my 2d design class seems really interesting, but it was so stuffy in class. now i have to buy my book and art supplies and see how much of it i can put on deferment.  *bleh*  i woke up too late to yoga this morning, but i had great sleep. ^_^  i think i'll plan to do it 3 days a week (m, w, f).  that should be enough to capture the full benefits of exercise.  ^_^

      i went to my first class.  it was pretty cool.  now i have to go buy all sorts of art equipment. ^_^  right now i have a 2 hour wait before my art history class. i just know it's going to be like this again tomorrow. -_-  traffic has worsened this semester.  they've cut off most of Woodward and everyone was trying to get into the parking garage this morning.  it was backed up all the way ocala.  on the way to school i nearly had an accident because some impatient driver decided that looking both ways before merging into traffic was a "good thing."  lucky for me there weren't any cars in the next lane so i could swerve out of the way.  *grrr*   but for now i have this interminable wait.  O_o  campus is way to crowded now.  i could barely find a computer to get on.  i had to come down to the basement to find 1 free 'puter.  and the union is just packed and noisy.  it'll probably get better once everyone waiting in line for football coupons leaves.

      [42: answer for the meaning of life or horrible price for cd]  I went to AWA (Anime Weekend Atlanta: www.awa-con.com) on Friday.  OMG! It was incredibly lame.  Most of the viewing rooms were showing licensed stuff.  They're Honk Kong action room was showing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...>_  we wanna try for animazement, but it's the last weekend of may and in north carolina.  i wanna fly but soup doesn't care for planes in general.  driving all the way up there takes a full day we'd have to leave on thursday and come back monday to get the full effect.....grr.  anyway, we went and came back from atlanta friday.  (it was that bad) but i got KOGEPAN! =D kogepan rocks....he's this little burnt bread dude that hangs out in a bakery giving lessons to the kireipan (or pretty bread).  ^_^  i also purchased a new toaster yesterday for $15.  it's a 4-slicer and HUGE.   =P  NOTE:  $42 is a ridiculous price for a cd even if it is imported from Japan.  *bleh*

      at the end of this month i'm heading to [ urlLink AWA ].  i'm not really sure what i want to look for, but i know i want to go to Iwase Books to find some Japanese tv shows.  ^_^    i think anything else would be secondary.   maybe some manga, check out the viewing rooms, and stay as far away as possible from fanboy stench.

      no more funky quizzes for a while  =P  [Waterboys!] A friend sent me this Japanese movie...it was really funny. More people should watch it.  Anyway...i'm still working on my wire project. I'm hoping it'll be done tonight to show tomorrow.  It should've been done last Thursday, but, as usual, I forgot about it. I did finish my found objects piece for today though.  It's just a tree made of beans with a border of chopsticks. I'm not particularly impressed with it, but it's okay.  Currently, my favorite thing to do is check out website designs to see what's possible and maybe learn how to do it.    Ah well...still want lots of manga and anime...it's so pretty.  ^_~

      [My appetite is as big as the universe!]  Started a J-drama yesterday called "Food Fight."   I suppose one would classify it as a romantic comedy.  It's about a guy who helps at the orphan home he used to live at.  He works as a temporary janitor at some company and for extra money he competes in an underground eating contest (kinda like of like underground fighting rings, but instead the challengers have to eat food.  a bit weird, huh?).    As for school, I have a test on Friday in art history.  Other than that, I have a wire sculpture due next week (I think), but my backpack crushed it.  I'm going to have see if I can bend all back into place.  My really big rubber stamp self-portrait is almost done.  I liked it better before putting the little stamps all over it.   My roomie's b-day was yesterday.  We took her out to Road House for dinner after the previous night of "binge" drinking.  ^_^  She was plastered, but I tried to keep my intake down.  ^_~

                                     You've been overdosed         so many times with chocolate and pocky, that hyperactiveness has become         second nature to you. You usually act without thinking, and you trust         people too easily, but everything always has a way of working out for         you in the end. You also adore blonde nicotine-enhanced writers who         think you've got zero talent - but who doesn't?               urlLink Which         Gravitation Character Are You?

      [squee!]  I've been doing a lot of downloading off of mIRC from the digital fansubbers that hang out on irc.enterthegame.com.  The newest I've picked up is "Naruto" from #toriyamaworld.  It's pretty kick-ass with all the ninja action going on.  Plus, I have the first 14 episodes of "Witch Hunter Robin" from #rice-box.  That show is pretty tight as well.  It's just getting in to a deeper plot. ^_^ Enough about my fave animes right now....I've some art projects to work on at home.  I received one today (in drawing 1)  where I have to make stamp out a self-portrait.  In 2-d design class, i have a wire sculpture of buddha-esque figure to work out.  I'm hoping to get some ammonia and copper wire and do some scientific experimentations.  ^_^ I'd also like to get some work started on a new web design, but I'd like to get my own domain and work it out.  I was thinking about purchasing some space from blogger, but it'll have to wait until I've some moolah saved up.  *sigh*  evil^2=$  x_x

      [how to get the b/f to thanksgiving dinner] thanksgiving is next weekend and i'm not sure if i'm going to visit family.  if i do, i have to get my b/f to drive an hour and a half to get to my grandma's place.  i'm not sure if he'd be willing to do so, because the  last time i convinced him do it, other family members didn't come and i wound up sleeping on the couch for a couple hours.  he was quite displeased with me.  :P  oh...it's "cold" here in florida.  i'll have to get out my winter clothes this year, it seems.   went to see harry potter last friday.  wah! it was cute.  ^_~  i had fun watching it.  i just wish the lawn gnomes had been left in.  ah well...i can always read the book again.  ^_^  also...i'll be editing the manga Tokyo Underground some time this week.  Prolly by wednesday.    {new favorite shoujo anime:  princess tutu}  *quack!*  it's so cute.  and it has pretty ballerinas and reminds me a bit of pretear.  :D  ah well...i should get some lunch soon...my tummy says it's time for yummy.  =P

      [winter vacation]  ....to be spent working and meandering about my house without direction. i never did make it to thanksgiving dinner.  :(  the whole time thing wouldn't allow it. anyway, must earn $$$ to buy some 'Peach Girl' manga.    still don't have a car....what else to complain about?....*looks in inventory*  beh...stuffs i don't wanna talk about.  let's move on to 'Star Trek: Nemesis.' ooh...it was so purty. =D  i liked it lots.  eye candy....as star trek movies go, it's one of the good one.  ^_^ next week i'll be seeing LOTR: The Two Towers.   right now i need to go to bed (i have work at 9 am) but i'm not feeling the sleep  bug.  >. i suddenly felt like being all creative and i started playing in photoshop.  thought i might make a background,  but i'm still working on playing with the effects.   i might start reworking my other website to amuse myself over the break.  that and try to clean  my house some so i can have a place to get down and dirty with my artwork.  it sux not having enough space to get my work done  for class.

      [....rain sucks]  well...it's been a while hasn't it.   this morning (tues.) i went to class ready to do...something.  unfortunately, the teacher called a research day and everyone pretty much left to come back later.  i stayed to peruse some 'parakiss' and an artbook for 'jojo's bizarre adventure.'  halfway through i passed out after doodling little heads in my sketchbook. (wow....fascinating)  anyway, when it was time to leave, it had been pouring outside for a while and my car was no where near my class.  i finally reached my car after a long trek through heavy rain.  soaking wet and dressed for work, i had to make my way home to change clothes.  unfortunately, i had been wearing my only pair of work pants. before clocking in, i bought a new pair (along with a shirt) from old navy.         *gah*   >.
