      I never saw myself as part of the beauty in the evolutionary change. I wasn't cultivated like that, unfortunately.  Then, of course, I got sick and ended up feeling forever on the end of the evolutionary change.  I pretend though.  It has helped me talk to those I see as part of ascention.  But, the pretending never helps me clue into whether or not they notice me back...  ...then there is Darwin.  I have to see him.  It is a requirement and his job.  He has to touch me, it is his job.  He has to speak to me, again, his job.  I was so intimidated by him at first, I couldn't speak.  Then, I reminded myself that I am so low on the change that I might as well be myself--I have nothing to loose.  So, I did.  I bantered and giggled, shared opinions and favors; I even brought my snotting, weepy eyed self in with a cold.  That was when I heard it.  I coughed and defended the sound with a pathetic, "sorry, I told you that it wasn't pretty."  "Nope, you are still pretty."  Say what?  Was there some one else in the room?  Next visit.  Laying on my back with his hands on my shoulders, "what is this scar?"  "Oh, part of this one,"  I point down into my cleavage. "Where was that again?" he asks in a smooth tone followed by a chuckled as I pull my shirt down again.  I am not too quick on the up take.  He apologized for being unprofessional, but all I could do is chuckled back and excuse him.  He is what Darwin meant when he outlined what should and will survive.  I can't believe that he would even notice that I was a woman, let alone some one to 'flirt' with.  Either way, it is a nice dream...even if I just made it up in my head...

      Joan Jett bolts out a breathy and commanding queston, "do you wanna touch, do you wanna touch, yay, do you wanna touch me there?"  A pair of black patton-leather, thigh high, spiked heeled boots are straddled on either side of a golden pole in the middle of a broken rectangle shaped stage.  From this angle, I can see the swelt curves of her milky thighs that lead up to her sweetly round ass that is currently being split up the crack and emphasizing the tilt of her hips.    Waist length, chocolate brown hair wisp over her shoulders and bounce off her extra short, plaid and pleated school girl skirt.  Actually, it was more of a waist ornament that laid just below a perfect 'inny' button.  After making the pole beg for more, she throws herself against the mirrored wall and with a saucey flick of her head, she flips her arms up and melts into the floor...one finger dripping off her pouty lower lip.    A sudden burst of wet comes over me.  I can't take my eyes off of every inch of her.  Her white button down shirt that has the sleeves ripped off is tied up between her flawless, handfull sized breasts.  LOLA is printed in shiny gold and hung strategically above her cleavage.  Down her slender arms she is painted with 50's style body art, old school tattoo's.  She is bad and a tease.  Nice.  Her strut is like a hand on the leash of her audience.  The irony is the song because it is an understatement.

      I saw Michael Moore's most recent flick tonight.  I have read his books.  I even teach his media literacy units to my students.  I think that he is brilliant, but not in a conventional way.  It takes the form of perfect matter-of-factness.  And, unfortunately, I am deathly reminded of the things I wish I didn't know--the things I wish I didn't see.  I don't watch the news.  I avoid the news paper.  I tend to bury myself in superficiality, not because I am, but because it is all I can stand.  When I was eleven years old, I saw the movie, "The Color Purple."  I remember seeing the rape in the beginning and getting sick at the sight of such helplessness.  Then, as the movie progressed, I saw the same man flog and verbally abuse the same woman.  I ran out of the movie and my mother had to come out and reassure me.  Of what, I still, to this day, do not know.  That incident marked the beginning of my soul sickness and deep empathy of others.  No, I am not placating the martyr.  I can not subscribe to that so simply.  It is just that things on the outside, society, people, the planet and its evolution is a constant reminder of lack of control.  Now, you may suggest that avoidant behavior is really systemic of a person who doesn't care.  Or, you may even suggest that it is a cop out.  This all my be true.  But, each time I submerge myself in it, I become saturated with the evidence of our world; the ignorance, the poverty the piety and its subsequent disintegration.    Hooray for the brave ones who do not have the burden of the heinous fore fathers.  Congratulations to the those who may be so vocal and achieve a sense of propriety.  I am born of the ugliness that festers with non of the frills of its source message.  Either way, I see it; I am unhappy and tethered; and in the end, I am fucked.  At least Michael can be the last crusader.

       I let you rape me again. At least, that is what I like to tell myself.  I can't really fathom that I am too weak to escape you.  And, I am ashamed.  I want to believe that everything is ok.  I want to take in all of the disappointment as a form of addiction.  I don't want to feel alone.  But, when you are inside of me, biting me, bruising me, choking me and muffling my screams, I am reminded that I am not.  You live wrath like me.  I can't tell you why I am so enamored with the ache you inflict on me.  I lie beneath you and watch your pupils dilalate, I feel your pulse quicken and you become infused with a strength that is only meant for your evils.  Sometimes, when I am alone and I don't have to pretend, I close my eyes and imagine you pinning me down, your legs on my thighs, bruising the tender flesh as it is being forced unwillingly against the bone.  I can feel your hands pinching the blood from my hands as you squeeze effortlessly on my wrists as I writhe beneath you, gasping for breath, because you just released your hand from the base of my throat.  Tears wet my cheek with a sting.  The skin on them still burn from the fervor of your hand.  I should be so enraged by this torture, but when you ask me to tell you to stop, the words become vapor.  Even when you wrench at my nipples and smother my face, my body defies my thoughts and my knowledge of right and wrong.  My clit gets harder and I become drenched.  When you feel this on your swollen cock, it begs to have you fuck me harder.  You tell me that no words can match what my body tells you.  You are right. I should loathe you, but I need you.    Purple, blue and crimson, welt and blister on my neck then trail down and blanket the white of my breasts. With each suck and gnaw, my mind floods with the images of you marking me.  Just thinking of this heightens the heat in my groin and I have to beg you to hurt me, to be in me deeper, harder and faster.  I know that I will look at myself later, blankly staring at the marks and bruises and I will rub and pinch them so that I will be reminded of you.  When my friends notice the discoloration of skin, the sallow green and muted yellow as the wounds begin to heal, they mourn for me and build contemp for you.  But, they don't know and I can never tell them.    I need the temporary scars.  I need the pain.  It smothers everything else that pulses through me and consumes me.  Letting you hurt me encapsulates all the rage that I am fettered to and knowing that it does the same for you, enraptures me. I try to shout at you from deep within.  The helplessness in me clamors to escape but evitably gets stiffled by your pleas of afflection.  I can feel every muscle of your being as your forced intimacy melts into soft reminders of your adoration of me.  My head wavers at the influx of your lips covering my mine and the whispering commands of reciprocal affection.  I ache.  I can't protest through my bewilderment.  You own me.  The quandry begins to fade when you embrace my face with your hand and swoop my lower back towards you and bury your cock deep into me.  With each touch, I relax more and more as if I was part of your own skin.  I wouldn't care if I were cut and bleeding, which often happens.  You bandaid the pain with each heave of your chest.  I can only get wetter and wetter and I am rewarded for being punished when you cum inside me.

      sometimes in the late night i find myself soul searching fiend picking through deep cream shag carpet for crack i don't do this, i know this and i have yet to feel the prick and sting that forces the ecstasy into my veins that can only be from brownsugar but, oh can i understand cause in a beat and a drip do i seek out the bliss and smell sweetest of sweets that only ethyl can effervese so it does as it did to soothe me, move me always using me then later in my travels i journey through the smoke as i choke my way to oblivion denying my abhorrance embracing only the sin i never ask, only beg the shell of me to crack and be free but the casing is too tight too hard to chip chip chip my person just a blip of being and doing and failing to become then i struggle again forgetting to remember or remembering to forget as i soul search deeper in that shag shucked hypocrisy that i am truly not missing glorifying its indulgence and beseeching its  denial--i walk away although i seem to crawl either way i escape to leave not  to be free but only to move on, to the next always turning my head as i walk or move forward seeing what is behind me as it feels like it is ahead...

      What woke me up was the dull throb above my left eye.  I came to, with a sharp sting in my tear duct and then discovered myself lying on something cold.  Linoleum?  I opened my eyes (or attempted to) and I realized that my left one was gooey and my vision was clouded.  It felt like my head I was packed up with cement and I could taste a bitter, metallic substance on my lips.  My head felt like it has just survived a prizefighter’s last round in the boxing ring.  I rolled over from my back to my side and noticed that I was facing the underneath of my bathroom sink.  What happened to the bathroom rug?  I smelt a dank and musty odor, but it was mild because it was difficult to breathe through my clogged nose.  I reached up to scratch away some of the wet away from my eye—a Vaseline like substance clotted up under my fingernails.  Still, I couldn’t really see.  It was dark.  Only the dim orange of my night-light illuminated my surroundings.   I slowly pulled myself up onto my knees and heaved my heavy body on to the sink’s ledge.  There I stayed—leaning on my elbows and somberly peering down into the sink basin.  Just then a wave of nausea and dizziness came over me.  I thrust my hands onto the cool faucet and turned on the water.  I didn’t’ bother to look up at myself.  The nausea and dizziness caused a cascade of numbness to flow over me.  The effort of heaving up to the sink made me feel like my head was going to explode--the pain was so horrid.  I let my finger lye under the falling liquid as it warmed up.  That is when I noticed it.  The water was turning rust.  My hands were covered in rust.  Some of it was wet and sticky and some of it was cakey and dry.   Still, without looking up I reached over and flicked on the light.  I dazedly looked back down to the rust and realized it wasn’t rust at all.  It was blood.  Drying blood.  I winced with pain as I felt this piercing, searing jolt go through my left nostril and shoot to the back of my head.  I looked up. I think I stood there and stared at the reflection for minutes.   What I saw, I don’t think, you will believe.  There was blood all over me.  Stuck to my arms, hands and congealed under my nails and glued to my eyes lashes.  But, the worst part was my head.  My nose, on the left side, was blackened over with dried blood.  My cheek was a dark purple and green color.  The swelling had raised the flesh up so much that I couldn’t make out my own features.  My left eye, the one with the goop, the one I was having difficulty seeing out of, was sheathed in a thin, watery blanket of blood that was still oozing from the front of my forehead.  There, I could see what was the source of the pain that woke me up.  It was coming from my scalp, which been torn or cut away from my scull on my left side and went to somewhere in the back of my head.  The skin and hair were flopping around and jagged pieces of flesh were dangling in random places.  I was hovered there—frozen.

      I need all the things that make me whole The things that tether me to this existence I am pieces scattered and disheveled I am longing that has no redemption I need parts that will fill in the blanks The things that help me pretend that I am I am broken because I walked through fear I am small because I did with no choice I need all the things that are dark in you The things that you give unwittingly too I am a bane and a resentment that bleeds I am caustic since I am parts of you I need what you can not give because The things you can not give is what is I am living without the idea of being I am breathing for you to smother me I need the pain that pulses through you The things you battle and sublimate in I am the pride you strangle and fetter I am the evil that comes from beneath you I need the ache that effuses from inside The things that effervesce and corrode I am the object of your objection and  I am the resistance of your true affection I need to have you as a mirror to reflect The things that hurt in the abyss of me I am screaming for the blood of you I am muted by the death of compromise I need the vision that walked before The things that saw what was taken I am the wise to the trauma and blindness I am ignorant to the benevolence in him I need to seek what is good for me, you The things that surrender and rescue I am the left-over of lost love and  I am the strength that was, is let go   Sunday, February 29, 2004

      The Power of Mother  What if she forgot to love you unconditionally? What if she didn’t remember to provide you with  care? What if she chose to be  selfish, in stead of selfless? What if she chose to scorn instead of listen? What if she never made you feel safe and was surprised at your fear? What if she was incapable of protecting and expected protection? What if she was  smaller than you inside? What if she was your mother? Now it is your turn… Now it is time to love yourself unconditionally. Now it is time to provide yourself with  care. Now it is time to understand the value of selflessness. Now it is time to take pause and  listen. Now it is time to be with those who  make you feel safe. Now it is time  to walk through your fear, grab the hand of god and know how to be protected. God is never smaller than you… You are completely whole. You are completely right. Your awareness completes you. Your spirit is loved and loved perfectly. Remember you have power--  To correct the wrongs of past. Remember that knowledge guides-- and your heart will  heal your past .

      Just looking at him renews my faith in evolution.  His presence brings a visceral rumbling from gut to gums.  The man can make your teeth itch.  It is not an intangible type of attractiveness that he exonerates, but it is unattainable.  Everything on him was put in the right spot.  The breadth of his shoulders elongates down his forearms.  Black hair, almond eyes, cut chin that cradles a smile of pearly whites and command of self that implores you to surrender.  Drool does even begin to cover the leakage he evokes...

      what the fuck is normal? hummm, i wonder.  is normal knowing who you are? where do you come from? what if you don't know?  what if you have been watered down by years and years of other abnormal people forgetting how to be normal?  then, there you are...unfuckingnormal...because no one taught you that normal is having come from somewhere and being proud that you came from normal.  what color is normal?  what gender?  what age?  what is normal's education?  where do i sign up? does normal have a tan?  or is it white like me? does normal have a conscious or does it just go along for the ride?  does normal become normal because it has been done over generation to generation with no one questioning it?  so, then you are abnormal if you go against the grain?  no, no, we can't have that...i see normal...i drown in it and they watch me, pity me, loathe me because i gulp and sputter and spew that i can't understand 'normal' because it is not me...

      Twisting and cycling in and out conscience pretending to be wooed by David Lynch's succubus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the malingering.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish my woe.&nbsp; Even though I am frightened, I tend to lash out at the burdens that have saved me.&nbsp; I am the strength that I have never known.&nbsp;   I am surrounded by possums of precipice.&nbsp; They all whine of robbery and the like, but can never muster the strength survive it without analgestic.&nbsp; Then they judge and ponder the wonder of malaise.&nbsp; Oh how unfair.   But&nbsp;lets think of things more worldly and contemplate how to create change.&nbsp; Still, while they pontificate the remedy they do nothing but revel in what they actually created.&nbsp; I, too, must turn a blind eye.&nbsp; Seize what is and what is now.&nbsp; I whimper and cry and they offer the 'oh, no's' with none a buffer or a sigh.   Just give me time to entertain my demons and I am assured to never be alone.&nbsp; Leave me for a moment so that I am alter the world I live in, bleed myself a bit and remind me of me and of where is home.&nbsp; I need to pick and fester.&nbsp; I need him to rip and shred.&nbsp; My body leaks without luster and my soul is shucked to bone.   Erotic could be the label.&nbsp; Malice must be shown.&nbsp; I only cum when it hurts me and I don't feel when there is sun.&nbsp; The dark places are the lands that feed me and I long to out live where I thought I came from.&nbsp; I don't control the paste of my position, but I am the master of whether I have won.

      I am off the medication.  Currently, it doesn't seem like a good idea.  I crawled out of my  skin today and on to someone elses.  I watched them through eyes that had no light.  They were black from the inside out, like a reflection of me.  Yesterday seemed indifferent, no difference.  Then, today, the difference bit me.  It bit so deep that the cuts are creating new folds in my body.  If I keep folding, I can be folded away.

      I want to play God today.  I don't mean the kind where I channel the enlightenment of a being that I have never met and claim to know what it wants.  I mean the kind of God that comes from the evaporation of guilt and morality.  I want to power through the righteousness of the masses and pluck them from existence.  I want to remove the weak, the indulgent the pious while stilling remaining from the mark of irony.  I want to be empowered by a hand of death that seems to wipe out anger and sadness from where I visit.  As God, today, I am evening out the odds and forgetting to turn the other cheek.  There is no longer a need to find humility and be set free.  Simply, freedom is evolved from the insidious, venomous annihilation of your person.

      Indifference.  It's worse than pain, but not as alarming.  Funny how you can have it and realize that you are viewing yourself from the outside.   That woman is to, to, tooo much .  I think this as I stare at the mirror, but the mirror becomes someone else's imagine.  Am I seeing what is real or am I imagining reality?  I like to let other people cut me so that I can bleed.  I put myself in the way of mutilation, a place that I know that I can control but I don't.  It is almost blashphemy and terribly ironic.  There is so little I can do about the world even when I try, but long ago I was left to my own devices.  Grown peoples with little hearts and feeble souls left me to flop and flail while their lives carried on.  Some of them were marred.  I seek out the marred.  The make much interesting company.  And, their broken parts fit my puzzle...

       I wasn't paying attention. Just grading papers and watching television. Some show about disappearances or something. The plot, this time, had a woman dying of cancer. I have seen this, I know this. I look down, read the lines before my eyes and listen. I hear a character pleading to have their suffering ended. It was a person begging to die because of the pain. Then, it struck me....  It is like a Mac Truck being plummeted off a cliff and into the core of me. Instantaneously, I pause, shudder and a fear grips me so completely that no words could describe in enough detail. It was as if you were forced to watch a bullet fly towards your head, those milliseconds become your world; that knowledge, that wholeness of the inevitable---just you and death. abominable pain. Visceral, incomprehensible agony.  I double over and sob. I don't sense my breath, my skin or my posture. I feel only pit of me, my gut. This isn't crying. It is more than that. It is a realization, that, as a human being I am given no promise, no right, to be here. That there is unbearable sanctions that are part of being flesh and blood. It is not a maybe, but a promise. It is a humility of existence and a parallel fear of not being worthy to keep what you have been given.  And, just as quickly as it came, it ebbs away and ungrips me. The scenes on the screen change to something less familiar, less threatening. Unreal, yet undeniably etched in me.  I tell people in passing that I suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That, as a cancer survivor, it is a latent effect. I say this in a usual, benign manner, until, a flash of the familiar hits me and I am there again. I am alone in my pain. I am thwarted into fear and I am maddened by the powerlessness. The psyche is amazing.

      Some one died today. Yesterday too. I woke up and realized that I didn't know how to appreciate that people pass and leave behind legacies worthy of ritual mourning. If I think about it too much, I will be crippled. They never taught me to respect the idea of longevity being worthy of praise. They usually didn't live long enough. They never taught me that family doesn't mandate adoration, but earns it. They never showed me that people live, love and gather to support and reflect on a life that touched theirs. I only learned that pain, prejudice and death are what you succumb to when no one cares. I watch them through glass lenses and it still remains unclear. I woke up when she died and realized that I fight against things I do not know or can not understand. Rituals are as important as the person. Peace comes to those who are humbled by the situations they do not understand. I am incensed by this--afraid of this and if I think about too much, I may not reundo.

      Spinning around in my white flannel p.j.s with the blue flowers, the Beatles bound out my anthem, you say its your birthday, well happy birthday to you I know they are singing it just for me. I hear this every year and I await it eagerly. My validation. My Dad standing by, smirking as I feverishly attack the brown shag carpet with my bare feet, twisting, turning and feeling the rhythm. Yeah, its my birthday, happy birthday to me.  Years have passed and I have had to spend this ritual alone. I sometimes play it for myself, but it is never the same. The lone Beatle, Paul, broke sanctuary of years by professing, Yeah, we were stoned. It was expected, just would rather have not heard it. It is as lonely as having to dance to it alone. The fantasy gone, the primal dance just a memory.
