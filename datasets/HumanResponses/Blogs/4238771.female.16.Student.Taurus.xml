        Ever wonder why girls learn to love another girl? It is not a sisterly or friendly love, but love as in love! If so, are they both lesbian? I'm from an all girls school, and girl to girl relationship is no surprise or a shocked for me. But its kinda' confusing how they can love each other like that, and I mean head over heels! Some girls I know cry when their special someone wouldn't speak to them or hide something from them. Some wrote endless love letters or kept on smiling when they cherished a special moment with their significant other. Some get tingling all over, even just a sight of their crush or love ones. Hello! What the hell boys are for? One of my teacher said that they haven't feel love yet, and when we do, they will just look at this girl relationship like a funny part of their lives. But if ever a girl liked another girl and vice versa, are they both lesbian? My seatmate keeps on telling me that I'm a lesbian because and don't act like a girl. But I don't get crushes with a girl like her! She said that she was the girl in the relationship, but still, she got into it so what's the difference? Am I, who doesn't act girly, a lesbian or she, who's in a girl to girl relationship, is the lesbian?   How do you actually define a lesbian?

        School, a big place where you can see almost everyone in the world. I mean, you don't have to go out of the country, in school, you can find different kinds of races! There are the Chinese, Filipinos, Americans, Japanese and people who claims that they have multiple races!!!! Whoa! Talk about United Nation!!! Its almost as if school is just one planet, right? And in school, we also have a world leader, George Bush a.k.a. "The Principal"!!! And we also have this wide ocean that acts like a wall. It separtes different kinds of people. The popular kids, the geeks, the losers and everybody else. So you see, School is really a big, big place even though it anly takes like about 1-2 hectare of land! And sometimes, you can feel the dizziness as it spins. It goes too fast then too slow for you to know exactly what you're doing. Even though, differences are among the students, some tried to get along with the "oh so mighty" ones and some, vice versa. Each group of people has their own culture. But in every planet, there are some countries who try to colonize smaller ones! Bullies! But even though these smaller countries are very tmid or not outspoken, you'll never know what they can do!
