      Yay! Finally!!! I woke up at 11.30 AM today. Watched some TV then started playing! Went to play Pandora Tomorrow. At first it hanged cos i was cheating then after I changed the settings back to normal, everything else did so too :D But I still cant belive that my video card (ATI Radeon 9200) is SOOO bad that I have to play PT on 640x480 settings... Of course I changed it to 1024x780 at the expense of some lag but I was using night vision goggles most of the time so there wasnt much of a difference. Then I went to play Condition Zero online...The first time since I bought it in April (or was it may?) Not much of a difference actually. It was the same as 1.6 but you could pick up grenades in this one :D And the maps and weapon models just looked different. Oh and the sound too. Overall, it was THE SAME!!! Played that the whole afternoon. And now (its @ nite now), im talking to roderic. Hes being an ass (as usual) spamming and talking crap. A'well, gnite... Im gonna watch The Simple Life in like 15 minutes.

      My! What a day it has been!&nbsp; Today's aquathlon sure sucked... Even though I just had to swim 2 laps (100 m), I felt completely drained and dizzy after that. I couldn't even get out of the pool to tap my partner. I mean, we didnt even ge to warm up...Minimal strecthing exercises were done and I didn't really have a good breakfast... And I hate swimming in the morning. Im at lot more off form when I swim in the morning... Sheeesh...  That was in the morning... In the afternoon, Canon came over to sign the contract... We got to demonstrate the products and explain all the details (to whoever was listening). Lol, all the teachers were impressed with the direct photo printing (fake or not?) and they were going ga-ga over it! Lol, talk about low tech. It went really well over all (for a change). As usual, Mr Ng n the VP of Canon made their speeches but I bet they were really pissed when the stupid mike started screwing up. Every few minutes or so, the mike would like cut off part of their sentences and it caused quite a stir among the audience. It was really fun showing off the products and I guess the center of attraction had to be the direct photo printers. Heh, then came the 'refreshments'. Why I put the quotation marks? Well, it was more of a buffet than refreshments. And all those greedy pigs (from techno of course) were stuffing their faces like no tomorrow! And the tea and coffee (which tasted really bad)...Man, you should've seen them... They were guzzling like camels... You know what&nbsp;I mean by 'kiausism'... After everything was wrapped up, I went to check out the UYOs and their NDP rehearsals... They had to stand to attention for like 2-3 hrs or so? That must've really sucked. And I was like observing them,&nbsp;enjoying coffee and tea. Lol, they must've been really jealous. John Chao was also criticising the UYOs, talking about how disgraced he was as an EX-NPCC officer, saying that he was ashamed and yada yada yada. Like WHAT-EV-ERRR... Who carez!!!   Its been like 2 or 3 weeks and freddie (the nightmare, for some taf club membes) isnt back. Haha, I bet roderic would like die of a heart attack upon seeing Freddie. Well, the rumours are that 1) He went to beat up some guy and got sacked and 2) The pay was too low and he wouldnt return until the sch paid him more. Both could be very likely 'coz Freddie really had an attitude problem and had a sadistic/moronic/dumb sense of humour. The sch is also kinda poor (thats what they claim) asking us for $$$. The sch must've been too poor to pay poor freddie. Well, as long as he isnt making a comeback, Roderic's (and many others) longevity would be preserved.

      Damn! Stupid teachers are giving us more and more homework. Today, our lit teacher (FCS) told us we had a project on animal farm. We have to create a board game about it. Its a group project work (as usual) and guess how many members we had? Not 4 but twice that. Yep, 8!!! The maximum she allowed was 6 but we managed to bargain with her and ended up with 8 people. So now, our game board size is doubled (it was originally the size of a desk). Lotsa work to be done yo...   Man, tomorrow will be one eventful day... I have to go for the aquathlon and right after that, the Canon signing ceremony... Stupid taf club teacher made us compete in the non-competitive event. 1 person has to run 1 round barker rd n 1 person has 2 swim. Of course, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;the one who will be swimming. Tomorrow, Im also in charge of the canon digicam booth together with some frenz... I'll have to be familiar with the Canon Powershot A8O (the one which im gonna buy) and the pictbridge direct printer Canon CP-220... Bah! At least Im not doing ushering (omg, sooo booorrrring)... Ooooh, gonna have a sleepless nite 2nite... So nervous...   Oh and I didnt broke or fracture my finger after all... Just a stupid sprain...But it did hurt like sh*t... It doesnt hurt so much now :D

      OoooooWwW!!! My ring finger (thats the&nbsp;one beside ur&nbsp;pinky)&nbsp;hurts... :( Was playing basketball today n dis as$ -0!3 went to whack the ball out of my hand and at the same time injure my ring finger!!! So now I cant really bend it all the way or else it will hurt like sh*t and it also looks a bit out of shape... But wth, at least it was my left hand n not my right. Amazingly, I can still type normally! As usual, there's LOADsa homework... Sigh, life is sooo FOS  Oh and I cant wait!!! Canon coming this friday! Tomorrow, we're having the rehearsal and all that stuff.   2 more days to the aquathlon. I hope my injured finger can somehow get me out of it (really hard 2 swim wif a broken finger cos it will keep hitting the water, not very gd at all)

      Ooops, made a mistake... I learnt today that the price list was screwed up with LOADSA discrepancies. It said IXUS I was going at 650 when on their website quoted 550. They're just gonna sell us the products at a special rate depending on the demand of it. But I doubt it would be much. Everything is still unclear. Looks like I haf 2 wait till this friday for the dust to settle. Haiz...

      In case u dunno wad FOS is, it means Full of Shit. Canon n my CCA r signing a deal. They train us and we help em sell their products (u dun haf 2 noe much abt dis part). So naturally, there should be some discount for us special members rite.And I thought like we're gonna get 10% or 20% discount but NOOO... They dun even give us discounts! But guess wad, since I dun haf a digicam, my mum wanted 2 get one.  so we settled on this particular digicam which says its going for 649 bucks (no prizes for guessing wad it is) on the BUHLARDEE website. They're selling it for 649 outside and it even says so on the BUHLARDEE website but on the price list of the products they're selling us, it frickin says 646 and quotes the original price as 699. It even dare quotes the profit we're making!!! They're selling it for 649 OUTSIDE, WITH FREE GIFTS WORTH 300!!! Which would u choose, 646 WITHOUT free gifts (from my CCA) or 649 WITH free gifts... Dont ya think canon is FOS... Any1 hu did their research wud noe dat the canon powershot a80 is 649 bucks outside... sheeesh, buncha dumb asses

      Its been a LOOOOOONG time since I updated this (lol, as if anyway wud read this). After all the confusion and chaos, the dust has finally settled and this is what it is now...  I noe, not very much but at least i managed to sit down and actually learn n find out how 2 do dis sh*t...I've been surfing around, typing around, crapping around and I FINALLY managed to generate this pathetic and horribly plain n boring blog...WTH man...But anyway, im gonna add more stuff (u can bet on it) starting wif the LINKS toolbar. Im gonna link up all my favourite sites and my other friends blogs... most likely gonna change the background too but I kind like black...

      Finally! Its a Saturday!!! I woke up @ 10 today watched some tv then slept @ 12.30 until about 2.30! Lol, then I went out and here I am typing... I bought hair wax just now 'cos my hair was starting to look like crap but it isnt so much of a big deal rite...  With the release of Doom3, I've read 2 reviews about it so far... 1 from PC Gamer and the other from gamespot... PC Gamer rates it 94% while gamespot gives it 8.5 (which is 85% for those who suck at math)... Why the not-so-good review from gamespot? Well, first of all, I belive that Doom3 is a kind of an old school shooter. It was a remake of the original Doom back in the 90s so by now, its pretty old school... Its just run around in the dark, use flashlight, shoot anything that jumps out at you from the dark and repeat the entire process... I mean, if I wanted this kinda gameplay, I would rather go get Painkiller or Farcry, maybe even Halo! Gamespot belives that gameplay is a much more important aspect, as earlier mentioned. And the graphics, even though just as important, is secondary to the gameplay. The gameplay became rather repetitive and most of the time, it was too dark to appreciate the game's graphics anyway... It's kind of ironic actually... I mean, the graphics are for you to check out but its too damn dark and even if you wanted to hang around and ogle at the graphics, you'll soon be attacked by creatures from hell (literally)... Doom3 was overhyped... But PC Gamer seems to contrast gamespot's review... The only bad point that PC Gamer offered was it's bad humour! lol! I mean c'mon, its a game, who cares about humour! Other than that, PC gamer was praising Doom3 about it's graphics and sound and atmosphere and why-you-should-upgrade-and-get-that-new-video-card-and-that-dolby digital 5.1-now... In case you dinnoe what a dolby digital 5.1 is, its a sound system that places speakers all around you to get you fully immersed in the atmosphere, mostly tense and scary... Yup, in case you havent realised until now, Doom3 is scary...  The story goes like this: You're this guy (forgot his name) and its the year 2156 (or something like that)... You're on some Mars spacestation and its your first day on the job... Well, its not long before all hell breaks loose, literally... Some reminiscence-of-half life-catastrophe occurs and the entire station gets plunged into darkness... Everyone else becomes zombies and whatnot and only you and some other guy survives... So for the rest of the game, you go around staying alive and the other guy, some captain, guides you along...  Im defintely not gonna buy Doom3 'cos 1: Its scary... Its dark everywhere and all those monsters from hell... Im gonna get nightmares man! Yep, im a wuss... Go watch the exorcist if you're that brave than play Doom3 with the lights off...  2: My com most likely won't be able to play Doom3 well... I only have a Radeon 9200! It wont be able to generate such graphics or even play it at a high framerate... and lastly, 3: Im a halflife supporter :D  Well, I can only hope that HalfLife2 doesnt turn out to be a flop like Doom3 is with gamespot... But on the average, if you calculate, 94+85 then divide by 2 = 89.5! The average score for D3 is 89.5 which is quite good actually... Halflife2 received an 80+ score from PC Gamer like last year... But due to the HL2 code theft, Sierra/Valve decided to postpone the release... One of the gripes was that it had basically the same guns and secondary uses... I hope that they improve on this and by the time they're done, HL2 scores better than Doom3... *Crosses fingers* Gdluck HL2, for now, I can only wait till September/October

      My, what a LOOOOOOOOOOONG (x1000) day it has been... Instead of going home @ 10 (u guys be thxful!) I had to stay until 5pm+!!! I'd rather be sitting in the hot sun at the tennis courts and watching the parade and the SCDF wadeva-performance thingy than WORK WORK WORK... First of all, we T.Club people had to go and record the entire parade on the Canon MVI700i or something like that (courtesy of Canon)...  We watched the whole boring parade from lvl 3/4 and lvl 5... Then halfway, that was when things started to go wrong... Our camcorder ran out of battery... Daniel and KJ ran all the way down to the D&T studio (4/5 stories) to get the DC adapter, after running all the way back up again, we realised that they grabbed the wrong one lol... Then they ran all the way back down to get the correct one which they did... They connected it to the water cooler socket and we only managed to record bits n pieces of the parade from a weird angle (due to the length of the adapter wire) and even then, from the position which we were recording, people had to limbo past the taut wire to get past us lol... Most of the time, Daniel was recording the parade. But with great luck, I was the one who recorded those who fainted in the parade :D We also had 2 camera crews (clifford n daniel seet) who went around taking pics of the UYOs...  Right after that, we all went back down to the D&T studio. Whee, finally! Aircon!!! Some say that greatest invention!  Back there, we were all wrapping up everything... Charging the horribly pathetic batteries and compiling the pictures. N Mr See was like damn pissed, ticking us off and scolding the others... Somebody woke on the wrong side of bed today... Mr see wanted us to save the pics in the CF Cards to a CD... Leonard went to get the laptop but we could not use it because of the OS (Win98) which needed drivers for it to work... After lotsa crap (connecting the laptop to the internet to download the driver, then downloading the latest windows Service Pack), it didnt work in the end... What a bloody waste of time! Sheesh! We then used the D&T studio's computers (which were windows XP) and we managed to get it done... We=Daniel Lee &amp; Daniel Seet & Me... Haha, 2 Daniels sandwiching me :p  Ok, so after that, we had like 1 and a half hrs to burn... We went to Waffle Town for lunch and we saw Michael See n his wife!!! Haha, what luck!!! Then we bought lunch for leonard and KJ...  After they finished eating, we had to get ready for the Time Capsule thingy... Haha, armed with my A80, I started taking pictures of that gaping hole in the ground where the time capsule was supposed to be placed it... And guess what, the time capsule was SQUARE...A square in a circle -.- sheesh... Then the VIPs and guests started coming in... I was supposed to 'shoot' them signing the guest list and I dinnoe it was upstairs, at the drama theatre... Haiz...  After that, it was damn blardee hectic... I went around shooting pics, then running down to get them printed then back again... Then everyone started to crowd around the time capsule area while the guests and principals were 'checking' out the stuff that they were going to put inside the time capsule... While 'shooting' those guests, my frickin camera ran out of juice!!! Arghhhhh!!! So I ran all the way down to get whatever I shot printed... Since there was no battery, KJ borrowed Clifford's batteries to get mine printed... omg... Did it feel like eternity! We printed and printed and printed... The stupid printer took so damn blardee long to print out each photo! It really felt like some newsroom! Mrs Tan was rushing us to print out the photos that were just taken to put into the time capsule... Since my photos were 'outdated', Mr See made me take more pictures of the blardee event... They were already sealing up the blardee time capsule which I had to snap pics of... So much rushing around... Bah! Im just glad its over... We still had to come to school tomorrow for a debrief(saturday)! Of course im not going! Why should I come to school just for 20 blardee minutes and go home right after that... HELL NO, MAN! And I'm also to go for the 2.4km run retest but of course, im not going... Hey! I mean im so damn tired after today, and its a SATURDAY damit... Saturdays are for sleeping till noon! And now, im like typing all this just for the helluvit...Even tho im so bloody tired... A'well...Good nite guys

      Slept kinda late last night so I was quite sleep the whole day... *yawnz* But anyway, I still managed to keep up the record :D I didn't fall asleep during class ;) Marc Seah gave me this website with some CS movies. They're made from flash and are kinda funny (somewhat). The website is  urlLink www.blackmaze.com  go check it out. And also check out the nintendo DS and the Sony PSP. They're coming out sometime l8r and I bet they're gonna cost more than a nuclear bomb! Last I heard, PSP was gonna retail for abt 600 or 700 US... Nintendo DS, if i remember right, was gonna retail for about 2 or 3 hundred US bucks... You can check out more from  urlLink www.gamespot.com  and  urlLink www.gamespy.com  Whee, cant wait for both of em... So many upcoming titles and hardware... Bah, to hell with N-gage, it can wait but Halflife2 and star wars battlefront cant and did I mention Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory... I cant figure this out, im like so damn tired in the morning, but in the evening, I get less tired and become more energetic... Hmm... I would've put more pics but Im on a tight schedule, my tuition teacher coming in less than 5 minutes... Im finally have tuition!!! lol! I cant belive I just said that! Someone who actually likes tuition! Nah....

      Bah! Duncha just hate mondays... Back to school so damn soon... Haiz... Im like so damn tired, I almost fell alseep during class, but to keep the record, I had to keep myself awake. Then when school ended, there was some trouble. SYY didnt sign the CMR for assembly. She only signed MT but not the one at the TOP.  Heh, Ben and me wanted to forge the signature but thought better of it... So we decided to go to MA Rm5 and tell the prefects on duty (CMR). But guess what, there were NO prefects, they all went for some meeting at the concert hall/drama theatre... Bah, so in the end, we just arrowed the signature from MT to Assembly... Nothing else we could do anyway... Then right after that, we had sci remedial... After waiting for like 30 minutes, then did Eric Loh arrive... And there were only TWO (2) of us in the sci class... Sheesh... Bleaurgh... And here I am ranting about today just for the helluvit...
