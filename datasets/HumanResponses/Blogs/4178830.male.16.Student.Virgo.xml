      well well... should i change the entry's title?.. hmm... well today's the start of the common test.. it's a one a half hour test which means.. i was in school for one hour and a half... the test was exceptionally okay since well at first i saw the essay question was about hero... it was okay... i couldn't believe what i wrote for the application question... it asked which definition of hero do i think is better, [one, for achievement and qualities, second, for having courage and noblity, third, about shaping history and being central figures in certain events.. like hitler].. i chose the first and gave a one page explaination about stuff like the impossiblity of unable to achieve a task without determination and etc.. then came to the part where you are to write about someone who you think is a hero to you... well i had a few people in mind.. like martin luther king [i forgot how to spell his name at that moment therefor i did write about him, if i did.. i might as well turn up an essay about him].. then i thought about grace.. she was one that had determination to run the nationals cross country and got first.... so that was a motivation for me... but then i would be revealing my secret to the teacher right?.. so well came this great man.. that i feel is of great heroicness...  that guy is iverson.. yea!!... he's great man... i want to be like him.. play like him and be like him... he fought his way through to greatness.. he can play so great like there's no tomorrow... man he's great.. the amount of determination he put in was what i wrote down... thanks to the news and interviews i read from the net... i summerised everything to a page full.. after that i felt so great... i had do what the teacher taught me... i think... haha... well now.. i downloaded the game call survival project... man that game is so cool... haha... got addicted.. well quite nice but then there's a limit anyway... i got to study for maths and physics anyway... test is tomorrow... hmm.... well jolene smsed me... which is quite a surprised... coz.. not much people would msg me instead i'm the one msging them... haha..   well in the morning azlin and fina made a deal with me.... i have to ask for grace's no. on my birthday which is like 7 days more... not counting today... go do your maths if you don't know when... haha... well i wonder how in the world am i am to get it... haiz

      hmm... same thing everyday.. got selected for the leadership camp..... donated a packet of blood today though.. nothing much... no pain.. actually i was crapping through out so not really feeling much... night studies... well before the thing start.. noodles asked me why i've not been talking to millie... well... she's that someone that smsed me the msg about sending night wishes to her [refer to the entry before this]... well then noodles tell me that why i get worked up over this.... hmm... it's just that i feel some people are really that unappreciative.... at least i msg good night... even sometimes i'm trying to be nice to people... they just shoot back in my face like.. what the hell... so after that i've been thinking.. and constantly being asked by noodle if i was angry or stuff.... well that brough back a few thoughts.. am i really that a person where they only see me being the all-is-nothing kind of person... am i really seen as one who only knows how to joke, be sarcastic and make people like harder...?.. do i have the look that i would bastard anyone... ?... i have no idea what people see me as... i mean... i can be polite, nice.... but am i not helpful... and all... nice to everyone except occasionally i'm sarcastic and crapping about.... being lame and all.... so well people just don't see that in me do they?... all they see in me a jerk and asshole?... or a bloody guy that is here to talk cock and do fuck off.... i pretty much have no much thoughts to go on.. i've stop sending the night wishes to millie... since i find it useless to wish someone good night when who doesn't appreciate you good thoughts... man.. my life's fucked up.... i reach home... and find that my com is being used by my brother.... i told him to concentrate on his studies.. i told him nicely but then he instead fuck me back in my face telling me not to show my temper.... what the fuck.... i was telling him nicely.... i didn't even bother to move... i just told him that he's just going to suffer when my mom come to intervine... then my dad came... what a big fucking asshole my dad is.... he's one hell of a father that can really pissed you off....  he told me he had enough shit in the office and doesn't need any more at home.... fuck you dead man.... i didn't even start arguing with my brother.... then he looks at me and then tell me this :  "don't give me that fucking look.... i work like fuck in the office for you three fuckers and i've have enough shit... i don't want to bring that back home and show it on you assholes... if you want to try.. i'll make sure i'll killl everyone in the house before i kill myself..."     there you have it... words from that big motherfucker... it's like i just reach home bath and was eating when he just fucked me in my face.... it's like was that needed?... i didn't do anything then i get fucked... so that's why i rather stay in school and study till 9 and come back to bath and sleep... god... i can't stand my dad... fucking asshole... all he knows is that if we don't do anything... he'll be the one making a big motherfucking mess about those shits... so how the fuck do you think i was able to study at home... least should i say my brothers creating noise about.... that's the reason why i'm always with my headphones... they are the most precious things next to my hp and com.... i need the music to push this fucking shit out of my mind....  fuck this life.... i hate this shits.... i've an important test tomorrow.... i just feel so fucking stress... 1, i need to cope with having to bear the fucking insults my dad throws at me... 2, i got to handle my studies.. 3, people either need to know that i'm not that bad of a person.. either that or they'll die thinking that i'm a fucking bastard... 4, time is not waiting for me... neither is grace.... speaking of grace.... she's a god to me.... all this shit i've feeling everyday can be cut temporary when i look at grace... it's like have a faint light being shine into the darkness that i've been hiding in... just looking at her would momentarily stop those negative stuff from further corrupting my heart... but then... i guess some things and people are meant to be untouchable.... haiz.....

      well well... now i'm back online.. it's freaking 10.54.. back from night studies and all... these few days i've been restricted by my dad from using my com since he was downloading something .. well so i've got no chance to get an entry into here.. days has been quite well... i think.. hmm.. things are the usual.. well jimmy is still in school.. not leaving... haha... hmm.. maybe we should like organise a farewell party?.. my life's quite stressed up by a few things... well i sent good night msgs to some of my friends [those who i didn't send.. it's not i don't want... too lazy to sent it].. i didn't know i re-send a msg to them... well  someone  just send me a reply saying that i don't need to send her anymore night msgs.. since it's boring to re-read msgs.... i'm like.. wtf? at least i had the right mind to wish you good night.. so well i think people just don't see the nice and well-mannered part of me... even just talking nicely would cause people to be suspicious... so well now... am i really that bad..? does my image really say that much?.. god knows.. well yesterday night... mr. anders was talking about his theory.. which i find quite interesting since well he had part of what i've thought about... except that he was thinking much in depth... haiz.. grace sprain her left ankle... i think she cut her hair or well tied it differently since she look different but then still pretty.. hahah... haiz... i have sort of make up my mind... i'll try to ask for her no. on my birthday... so i got like 8 days left?.. haiz...

      okay... now it's freaking 10.31.. stupid... i don;t even know if i'm tired or i'm too sick of anything... well days sort of pass infront of me... like watching a movie.. though watching a movie would much more be interesting... haiz... i can't believe i was awake for freaking 45 minutes just to listen to this bugger talking mostly about his prized lantern and man... he took only like 10 minutes to teach how to make a freaking lantern.. and all was like get four carboard fix them together.. then wa la.... a lantern!... fucking stupid... so after school headed over to bartly campus for basketball... coach sick so no training but there was photo taking.. and well photo taking sort of suck... except that i get to see grace take a pic.. haha... it was the same photographer.. and he was like pissed off since there was like so many of us and he wanted us to squeeze.. in chinese ji... but then it would sound like chee bye.... haha... and the worst thing that guy can do is try to shout but then ended up splurting his salivary all over... so after that we played basketball.. duh... so as i was waiting for my team's turn to play.. i saw millie sitting at the bench at one corner... and well she looked kind of pissed .. so i didn't try to talk to her... scary..  then went back to school had night studies till 9 then.. reach home..   hmm... now... each time i see grace... i get a lot of thoughts... so many things just suddenly pop up for me to think about...  to think that life is great.. would mean that having to be able to deal with life's sufferings.... why in the world does god have to create life that it would have people born with disability?... why does it create sufferings?... i can say i'm lucky but then what about those who aren't?i wish i have the power to help this people... but then now.. i can even help myself... i can't even manage my own time... pluck my own courage.. what makes me think i can help others?... i hate myself if i can't even do a little thing to help people... i can't help it...  grace is the second person.. that i admire.. though i have looked at other girls but then.. grace just keeps staying there.... well heard she has a boyfriend... haiz...

      hmm.. today... time sure pass faster than i can count to 10... dang... i never did much... achieve almost to nothing... well.. i went to school for crystal growing.. prepare saturated solution and all.. then left to meet stitich at clementi interchange... hmm.. after that headed for queensway... went there for nothing... couldn't even find the bag i wanted to buy.. so later that went to go meet S.a.m and noodles... ate then head to play pool... time sure fly coz like after 3 to 4 games of pool it was already 5 plus... so head back to city hall.. stitch and me went to the adidas shop at city link where i saw the bag.... took awhile to reconsider the bag before buying it.... then something happen... stitch's atm card cannot cash in... so then he went to personally withdraw... even worse.. account only have like $11... so then i lend him cash.. so after a hectic mathematical calculation... we finally have 34 bucks and $10 from the atm to pay for his bag... haha.. so end up both of us got buy new bag lor... haha...  thoughts..:  hmm.. well what i've thought about now is that... time really is flying past my eyes... so fast.. i can't believe i'm gonna turn 17.. [not a cause for celebration]... i mean... it's like half the time i don't even know what i did just like a week ago... this life... we have not really been attending to time... not fixing our attention to time... though we may plan but did you plan for time to pass so fast?... life can be a good thing... but then.. time is one thing that mankind can never ever stop or freeze... time is one that is second to death... one that slowly picks the life out of our body... time can peel our flesh and reveal an old self.. time would slowly or depending to situation pick your strength off... extracting your soul... do we have time to think about all this.. i don't think so right?... well i have... can we really slow time?..we can... if we have anticipated this... i believe we would be about to save or motality... or.. can we? see this year is coming to an end.. and.. well this is the last year for grace to be in MI.. so how in the world can i get her no. pluck up the courage and waiting for the chance to ask her.. all in like two months time?... that's y... haiz... time is short.. damn... not like games where you can enter cheats for unlimited time... haiz...

Can someone help me too?.. haha... did anyone watch the singapore idol...? so freaking funny... people can zhao sia and all... pitch wrong.. weird performance.. and all.. haha... stupid sia... even got one that acts like william hung.. that's kind of ridiculous... but then he got the guts to do it infront of live television.. hmm.. quite tired... wash, polish and shine my dad's car.. today i had to do extra steps to clean the car.. got to apply another coat of wax on the car... takes alot of skills to do that.. haiz... man tomorrow is a school holiday.. wonder what to do.. though i'll be in school doing crystal growing.. but then i plan to do till like 1pm.. so i've got like 5 hour to play around with... 5 HOURS... what the hell am i gonna do with it..? i might be going to buy that Adidas bag that i just saw.. almost the same bag as josh but then... well it's BIGGER!  damn.. common testes are coming... i've got a whole lot of topics to cover... ahh... sian.. so many things to do..  hmm.. got to work harder.. if one month of studying gets me crappy results then i got to study more than hell in order to get As... shitto..  okay if you're new to reading my blogs here's one thing i always write what i think of... here goes..  in this life... what do we have to achieve?.. am i here to be used?.. to be chanced upon?.. or to be left out?... i feel my life is or has become a cycle.. where i just study.. sleep study sleep...  the advancement of man.. to advance to the futuristic kind.. what if.. what if we advance till the stage where mankind kills itself in the search for better life? hmm... so now.. we may live in the world where things might just not seem what it looks like.. so how can you see things the way you see it if it has something more sinister behind? how can we believe our friends [i'm not indictating i don't believe you guys]... what if their smile hides another meaning other than happiness... what if it means that they have something evil planned for you? can you trust your friend.. the way you trust the bank to take care your cash?.. can you do that?.. i believe you can .. so do i... but then it's not that nice to realise that your trust is being used against you... do you fight back?.. do you serve revenge back cold.... or do you dismiss it?..  finding that in the first place.. your trust was put on the worng person... how can you judge a person not by his/ her looks?.. what if her looks match her character?..
