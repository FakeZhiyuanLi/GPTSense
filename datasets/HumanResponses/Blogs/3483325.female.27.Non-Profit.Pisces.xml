      I am just going to start by saying that today I went to get my first spray on tan. Actually, it is pretty much my first tan of any kind. I don't tan. I burn. People have called me everything from pasty to porcelain-skinned.( i prefer "milky")  I am just friggin' WHITE. In every sense of the word. I have a flat ass, a boring white name and a voice that borders on whiny valley girl. So i am tan now. I also smell funny, kinda like warm olive oil. It's Italian tonight dear! There are parts of me that look bruised and others that are steaky. maybe I didn't do it right. I bet that most folks who do this already have some color, so these imperfections don't show up. It's suppsed to take another 4-6 hours for the color to fully develop. I'll let you know what happens.  I am kind of excited and kind of not. If it works out really well and I love it, then I'll have another way to spend money I don't have. It's like $30 a pop and they say you have to go back every week or so. Maybe I'll just do it once a month and deal with the interim pale-ness.  My pal is responsible for your reading this nonsense. She's a full-on blogger-chick and felt it was necessary to bring me into the Land of Blog.  I am happy about it though a bit nervous.  One reason i am happy about this is my days at my job can be very slow and I have been looking for an outlet to keep me occupied. On the other hand:What if no one reads my blog? Or worse, what if I am just boring?  I bet someone will tell me if that is the case.  I have been keeping a diary since the third grade and I am trying to get all of the diaries in one place so I can begin transcribing them - I have a far-off idea that I might try to publish them someday, if no other reason than it is almost a full account of my entire life.  That's gotta be interesting in some way.  I think I'll have to wait a bit longer to publish my more recent diaries though. I don't know if I want everyone to know everything about my whirl-wind single days - yet. Maybe I'll discuss that here. Plus, I still have a lot of living to do. IF (that's a big if) I did actually get published and went ahead and released all of the diaries and IF I became famous for it, wouldn't that completely change my life in a way? I would not longer be able to write from the standpoint of the regular Joe. I'd be famous and shit would be all fancy and new.  Not only that, but how self-less would it be of me to wait until I died to publish. Then it truly would be a nearly complete life story, lacking only the years prior to the third grade.    Thoughts anyone?  Last, I am now single again. Yup, doing the divorce thing after only 8 months of marriage. In my eyes it's more like only 3 months because we separated January 3rd (married September 7th, 2003) and it was pretty much over then. It sucks. I've been in a vortex between not ever really being married and now not quite yet divorced. And I just found out that i won't have the satisfaction of a court hearing. Apparently only the plaintiff meets with a court clerk who then makes it official. (this is because it is an uncontested divorce - we had nothing to split except the wedding presents)  I guess I just wanted closure and I thought hearing some slightly overbearing divorce judge ask if the marriage is beyond reconciliation and then both of us (I will refer to my ex as CB) would tearfully answer "Yes" and then the judge would say something official-sounding like, "I now pronounce you exhusband and exwife" and it would be done. I feel I must explain that it was actually MY divorce, but CB filed the paperwork and therefore became the plaintiff and I became the defendant. eventhough it's really the other way around. I'm gonna stop for now. See what happens

      Pisces 6/30/04 "You need some serious R and R. You want nothing more than to put up your feet and sip a cool drink while lying on a chaise lounge, but someone prevents you from escaping. Accept that you have a duty to participate in events, as much as you'd like to slip away. Stay involved, but get ready to take a chance to get away from it all, which should be coming up soon. Find quiet ways to amuse yourself."

      I am not doing very well today at all. I am anxiety-ridden and overwhelmed. I don't want to deal with anyone or anything. I am on the verge of just bawling and my boss was just being a total bitch to me over the phone because she fucked up and isn't here right now for a meeting that she fucking scheduled. Fuck

      This weekend and yesterday in particular was weird. Bad weird and weird weird. Saturday I managed to get not one single thing accomplished aside from working out for an hour with roar(notlion). My inner thighs hurt now. Well, JM and I also made an appearance at Atlanta PRIDE. We bought a couple tallboys of beer though it was a somewhat sad experience because apparently Miller Lite was eked out as being THE gay beer. Our only choices were Molson and Silver Bullet. We had one of each. We joined a damp crowd at the stage to listen to folksy Angry Vagina music and then to some dude who plays the violin to techno music. I got the distinct (and slightly ill) feeling that he may just be the Zampfir (you know, the pan flute guy) of the new millennium.  Sunday JM and I met up with my good friend Diane and we all went to Waffle House. I got the usual: Bacon Lovers BLT with a side a scattered and covered hash browns. To the sad sacks who don't have a Waffle House in your part of the country, I pity you. (Huddle House is NOT the same thing and is, in my humble opinion, lame-o) JM and I had thought about going to the shooting range that day, but when Diane suggested we go to Neighbor's and have drinks on the patio, how could we say no?  We wound up at Atkins Park instead due to the rain. We promptly ordered Bloody Marys and got our Darts Game ON. Our fun and games were rudely interrupted when my phone rang: "Tom Calling." Tom is Chris' friend out in Colorado, but instead of assuming that it was Chris calling, I thought it might be Tom himself, so I answered:    "Hello?" "Hey!" It was an inappropriately upbeat Chris. Me: "Hey..?" Him: "Hey I was just calling to see how you're doing." Me: "I'm okay. Uh, how are you?" Him: "I'm doing well. I am going to be moving in with the pastor of the Unity Church here soon. He had a room open so I'm moving in. It's really nice with flowers..." (He said some other stuff at this point, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was busy trying to figure why he was calling me and my brain wasn't functioning because of the state of shock I was in) Me: "Oh, well that's nice." -Pause- "Hey, am I supposed to be expecting these kinds of calls or something?" Him: "If you don't want me to call then say so." Me: "I don't know." It was at this point I snapped out of it and really opened my mouth: "I just don't understand how or why you can call me like this when you had shown up unannounced at my work and given me that mean note. How can you do that? I also really need for you to know that the first line in your note, 'You got what you want [sic]' is NOT true. This is not what I wanted, Chris. I did not want to be divorced. I wanted a happy and healthy marriage, but you didn't make that possible. Not to mention what an awful note that was. It was so mean with all that stuff about being just like my Father." Him: "It wasn't mean, it was the truth. I'm sorry if it hurts." Me: "That is not the truth. Our marriage was dead long before I did anything wrong. All I wanted was to be married and have a husband and you weren't even that. You know that divorce was my only choice. We both agreed that we didn't want to be separated anymore. And I could not be with you any more because you were destroying me, so divorce was my only option." Him: "Oh, so it's all my fault." Me: "No, but I know I did everything I could and tried as hard as I could and you DIDN'T, Chris." (By now my voice was very stern. I wasn't yelling, but I was loud. I was thankful for the little bit of alcohol I had in my system because it made my anger more accessible. Before then, I had always frozen up and had been able to say what I really wanted to say. This time I was going to let him know exactly how I felt.) Him: "I am going to go now. This phone call was a mistake, just like our marriage..."   Hearing that, I just hung up. I wasn't going to let his misplaced anger go any further. Even though I got to say for the most part what I had been wanting to say for some time, I was still all shaken up (shook?). I was physically trembling for another hour while I tried to recuperate. We all agreed that Chris' phone call was his attempt to subdue his guilty feelings as well as move away from being "the bad guy." But these actions only hurt me more.   I just don't know what to do with these feelings that arise when he contacts me. It is so painful it sends me into a very unstable state. I imagine it has been very painful for him, too and that is perhaps why he acts out. It is all just so overwhelming and yet underwhelming because there is nothing I can do about it. I can't fix what happened. I can't fix him. I can't fix the way I feel whenever I am confronted with the sad reality of what was our "marriage." Even the $15,000 that my parents dropped for what was a GORGEOUS wedding stabs me in the heart.  I feel overwrought now. I don’t think I am going to go to the support group tonight. It seems so useless. All we do is sit around and gripe, but I know I am not really getting any work done. I just feel like I am beating a dead horse and when I leave my chest hurts, almost like I’ve just been dry heaving my thoughts and emotions for two hours.

      “Statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.” —Mark Twain, Chronicle of Young Satan

      My co-hort in crime,  urlLink roar(not lion) , made a lovely post today about rebelling against your parents and the inevitably resulting first kiss. Swooshed back to my own first kiss, I had to reply:   Mine was with a boy in Holland named Antje (I think). He is the reason I never visited Amsterdam because the only chance I've had was that day my parents went and I stayed at the hotel on the beach instead because of the strange and necessary pull that my whole body felt towards this beautiful angel of a boy. I was compelled to be around him. He took me deep into the cold sand dunes (Holland ain't so far from the Artic circle) and sat me down on some drift wood. Even though I wanted nothing more than to feel him close to me, when his lips touched mine, I FROZE. He pulled back and said in his sweet dutch accent, "Have you not kiss before?" Indignantly, I retorted, "Yes I have" and then tried to kiss him again, this time forcing myself to relax. But I couldn't stay there. No matter how much my body wanted his warmth, my insides had to run for safety. I was dizzy from the newness and my racing thoughts and maybe also because I had been holding my breath the whole time.

      I am tired and I want to go to sleep. I also do not feel like going to this function I have to attend for work tonight. I may be coming down with something. I know that I am feeling a bit depressed because I have not been doing the things I know I should be doing. The word "should" is a bad, bad word. It doesn't make people feel good. "Should" implies an active lacking of something: productivity, responsibility, goodness, worthiness, intelligence, ability, etc. And this results in feelings of guilt, shame or otherwise unpleasant emotions.  The main reason I am aware of my depressed state is my growing gut. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am getting pudgy for the first time in my scrawny-ass life and I don't like it one bit. I have always been so damn skinny (my nick-name in elementary school was skinnybonetoothpick. in high school I was regularly accused of being anorexic/bulimic.) and so it was the strangest thing yesterday when someone asked me if I was pregnant.  Wha?!   Granted, this person is not the brightest in the way of social graces, but still the question made me realize that something completely new was happening to me: I have gained weight. I know that some folks out there who struggle with their weight may take my statements as being stuck-up or unsympathetic, but please know they're not. I have also had struggles with my weight, only in the opposite way.   For most of my life I have had to fight to make sure I maintain a healthy weight. There have been times when if I didn't make sure I was eating enough I could easily drop 10-15 pounds UNDERweight. Despite "skinny" being "the look" now, a young woman who is 5'7" should not weigh only 110 lbs. According to some medical charts, I am "supposed" to weigh 130lbs. However I do have a small frame (read: small boobies) and so I have usually tried to keep my weight at least above 120lbs. I do not know how much I weigh right now.  But I am seriously digressing...  The point is that I have not been doing the things I should be and this has manifested itself in a number of ways including FLAB. I am so very inactive. I have to work at doing any kind of physical activity. It's not that I don't enjoy it. I actually like to "feel the burn," but I think I am just damn lazy and my demise rests somewhere in that space of just getting my ass away from the t.v. and off the couch. And this is where we come back to my original message of not taking care of the "shoulds" that I have in my life like going to yoga, cooking at home instead of always going out, reading more, getting more work done at work, etc. Side Note: Yes, yoga is the trendy thing these days for the listless white twentysomethings but it has actually been around for thousands of years unlike Tae Bo or worse, the "Gazelle" (BTW, is it just me or is there something terribly wrong with that creepy ponytailed spokes-eunuch?!).  It is here and now when I must take a step back and allow myself to be in the moment and all of the issues of mine that are here with me. Like with the weight gain situation - I should allow myself to live in this new experience. I must admit, I am somewhat fascinated with it. I have been studying the way my flab now spills over the front of my jeans and forms rolls. I am also thrilled with the slight increase in size of my breasts and butt. I have Boobs! Real life breaststs! It's amazing.   But with all this, I still feel the heaviness of my "shoulds." I guess it's a life long process of finding the track, getting on track, falling off track and then working to get back on track again.

      >>>>NEW! I found out this morning that Michael Moore's inspiraction for titling "Fahrenheit 911" comes from a book/movie released in 1966 called "Fahrenheit 451." First you must know that the  urlLink movie's  tagline was, "Aflame with the excitement and emotions of tomorrow!" What a gas! But what is scary and interesting is that the movie is about a frightening future in which the nation finds itself in a police state and most freedoms are stripped of the people. Another twist is that departments and offices are given odd titles. For example the Fire Department CAUSES fires instead of putting them out. They burn books and other means of gathering information that aren't disseminated by the Government. It is apparently a way that the Government sells something to the people as being good, when it really isn't in their best interests. Sound anything like "Patriot Act" or "Freedom to Marry Amendment" to you?  I am so utterly excited that Michael Moore's new film,  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 , is opening tomorrow (6/25/04)! You have to see the  urlLink trailer . I realize that this film is inciting a lot of controversy, angry words and curiosity - and that is just the way I like it. People SHOULD be angry and asking questions. I have such strong feelings about America's lameness in allowing much of what has happened in the past few years without asking the hard questions, without demanding evidence and a greater scope of information from our Government and our media. Of course I realize that I am included in that.   But things had become so  urlLink big  and out of the common person's reach - I think we did everything we could think of, especially when the war started. I know the protests were largely ineffective, but that was what we had always been told would work. That a large group of  urlLink equal-minded  folks gathering to show their numbers and let their voices be heard would be enough for our leaders to sit up and take notice. I really thought for a while there that if we could just get enough people together at one time in one place, then our leaders would say, "Wow. Okay. So the people of America don't agree with this idea. Let's find out what they want and how we can respect the wishes of the people."  Didn't happen though. And many of us were devastated. We even got angry at each other over silly things like choosing the wrong date for the protest or being too splintered into too many groups. I think we did the best we could. I know many people took a step back after that. Hopefully to re-think our strategy. I don't know how other people feel, but I know that when I look at the American Government through my heart and mind, all I see is a huge rock encasing all of the leaders. No exits or entry-ways. I know there are some of "us" on the inside, you can hear their cries for justice occasionally, but for the most part it is this impenetrable force that rolls around a crushes whatever it wishes with no thought or consideration for what's outside of it.   The sick part is, some of the folks that are in there aren’t even elected leaders. They're wealthy business men making it their goal to use the leaders to keep and even increase their wealth. I know that other, probably all, leaders have deceived the people, and perhaps at times it was in our best interest (I am not sure of that - it's just a thought). But while we nearly impeached Clinton for "oral in the Oval," we haven't really done squat to Bush for sending us to a war that many of us (and that includes folks in other countries) did not want. Not to mention all of the other wacko  urlLink stuff  he's pulled.   It infuriates me. I really can't get past this feeling of deep disdain for what has happened here in this country. People turn their heads from the truth, people hurting other people with ignorance and hate, people taking advantage of other people - all while the truly serious issues continue to get swept under the rug. Issues like a consistent and beneficial health care program or substantial education programs. Issues like crack babies and domestic abuse. Where is the love, y'all? What ever happened to that crazy ideology of the 60's that everyone should love one another and be free? Why did that fail?   I know I've basically just gone off on a wild rant. I am sorry and I am not sorry. I guess I just want people - ALL PEOPLE EVRYWHERE - to be happy, safe, healthy and loving to one another. Idealistic? Definitely. Since when is that a bad thing?

      Here is my horoscope for this week according to  urlLink Rob Brezsny :    In his poem "The History of My Life," John Ashbery poignantly refers to the death of his brother as a child. He quickly follows it with self-mocking humor about how fast that sad event forced him to grow up. "Ashbery is always vacillating between the unbearable heaviness and unbearable lightness of being," Fred Moranarco writes in The American Poetry Review, "as if moving between the two make both extremes bearable." I expect this will also be your forte in the coming week, Pisces: the ability to flow gracefully between profundity and frivolity, between penetrating explorations of complex mysteries and sweet celebrations of breezy delight. (P.S.: Unlike Ashbery's experience, your dive into the depths won't involve death.)   Perhaps this makes my recent posts make some sort of sense. Perhaps. I really like what Rob has to say for Pisceans. This is my all-time favorite horoscope from March 8th, 2001:   You taste delicious. The funny faces you make are interesting to look at. Animals understand you. Your importance is unusual. You fight for power in all the right ways. A lost tribe salutes you from the other side of the veil. You have strong feet. It is hard to have sex while cooking dinner, but you can do it well. You remind me of a star. No one can overflow as well as you can. You are famous with God. Gratitude radiates from you. You have a secret life in your dreams. Time is even now changing the way it treats you.  You belong to yourself.     Sigh.

      Two days ago I took a digital stroll down memory lane and went to the website I created for my wedding (you can do it easy and for free on theknot.com). I would link you to it, but it gives way too much info about Chris and his family and I am still attempting to keep some semblance of privacy for him (and myself for that matter).   On the page there is a photo of Chris and I that was taken the night he proposed to me. We were at a cabin on a lake that belongs to his friend's mother and dinner had just ended.  Everyone was sitting around the table, our tummies satisfactorily full with Iranian foods and our heads swimmingly tipsy on wine.  The person who took the photo was sitting across the table from us and snapped it as Chris and I were in mid-kiss. He had not yet proposed, but there was indelible smile on my face already anyway. His arm is reaching out to me, his hand, fingers spread, touching my arm.  You can see his tattoos peeking out from under the sleeve of his T-shirt. I loved those tattoos. They were stunning; of exceptional quality.  Perhaps I should have taken the giant wineglass that was in the forefront of the photo as a warning?  Because it was closer to the photographer, it looked enormous, larger than my upper body. Many people who saw the photo commented on the wine glass and then would go on to say that it was no wonder that he proposed since he was drunk. They were joking, I know, but I always took offense to such comments, perhaps because I was afraid it was true. But I would wipe my fears out of my head and focus on how much I loved him and how much he loved me. Surely he knew what he was doing that night, despite the lack of planning.   Now I am quite sure neither of us knew what we were getting into. Though, I feel that few people know what they are getting into when they decide to marry. There are some things you just can't know about until you do it, go there or have it. Fair enough. Looking at this picture I was taken back to that night and that time with him. The adrenaline rush I would get every time I saw him, the smells that told me he was close-by, the unforgettable feel of his kiss. I will NEVER forget his kiss. Even if all of the supposed love and promises behind his kisses were always false, it was that kiss, those lips that I miss the most.   Upon experiencing this rush of feelings I was deeply saddened at my loss. Real or imagined, my hopes for what my life, OUR life, was to become were so high and so tangible to me. It was like getting lost in a snow globe after looking at it for too long. Everything, though blurry, was beautiful; it was so real to me I could smell the snow. I made snow angels and he wrote I Love You's in the untouched whiteness. The connection we felt to each other was so intense and pleasing; I never wanted it to stop. Not to mention that despite my lack of interest in "wedded bliss" for most of my life, I had begun dreaming of my wedding day and jumped at the chance to have one with this gorgeous man.  The problem was it takes two adults to prepare for a wedding and more importantly, for a marriage, but it was our inner-children that had fallen in love and were running around playing make-believe.  I call my inner-child Seven because that is how old I was when my father left and my world fell apart. Seven is very delicate and still suffers from old wounds, as all of our inner-children do. As the wedding neared and the reality of the commitment and our responsibilities set in, I sent Seven back inside so I could get some work done.  I am tempted to say that Chris' inner-child stayed and even threw temper tantrums when he realized that the games were over, but I can't say what he experiences. It's his reality, not mine. My reality was one where I took the helm and made sure things got done. What I did not see then was that the dream I thought I was steering towards was already dead. Poof. Gone.  It makes me overwhelmingly sad to see and accept this now. I miss him, the way he was when we met, so dearly. I miss the way he made me feel; so very alive and full of hope. He would tell me I was untenably beautiful and even though it didn't make sense, I loved hearing his inventive use of words. Why couldn't he have been well? Why couldn't he have really been the man he made himself out to be (and probably really wanted to be)?   How did I suddenly find myself swimming to an unreachable shore, with him in my arms, almost drowning in my efforts to save him? I had to let him go. I had to. I had to. Now he's floating about somewhere in the big ocean of his reality and I am on the shore too riddled with hurt and shame to even look back. I mourn that which was once known as "us," even if it never really existed. I suppose some dreams should stay that way, out of reach and unreal. But can I say that if I ever find myself swimming in that ocean of dreams and love again that I wouldn't try again to keep afloat? No sir.    Swim on, little dreamer! Swim on.

      Peace Pilgrim is one of the most kick-ass walkers for peace on earth EVER. Here I have copied information about her from the official  urlLink website :   From 1953 to 1981 a silver haired woman calling herself only "Peace Pilgrim" walked more than 25,000 miles on a personal pilgrimage for peace. She vowed to "remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace, walking until given shelter and fasting until given food." In the course of her 28 year pilgrimage she touched the hearts, minds, and lives of thousands of individuals all across North America. Her message was both simple and profound. It continues to inspire people all over the world:  "This is the way of peace: overcome evil with good, and falsehood with truth, and hatred with love."  -Peace Pilgrim    On the website you can go to the  urlLink Quote of the Month .  How fitting then that this is the quote of June:    “If democracy is control by the people, as it is supposed to be, it is the right form of government. I believe in a complete democracy - individual, political, social, economic. If we really had that, which we don't now, it would be in harmony with divine purpose.”   -Peace Pilgrim: Her Life and Works in Her Own Words    You can read her  urlLink book  online and find out more about this amazing woman.  Sadly, she was killed in a car accident (she was on her way to speak at a school) in 1981 at about 80 years of age while on her seventh cross-country walk. But because of the words of wisdom she has left behind, her message of peace, love and hope lives on.

      I just found out that one of my blog's visitors found me by doing a search for: teen undress naked nude.  I was the second freaking website on the results list!    Ew.  It's because of my earlier post titled "my work." But I am also kind of excited because I would like to think that this person may have gone on to become enlightened from my clever banter. Har, har, har. BTW, this person is from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which is by far the most interesting place anyone has visited my blog from.  I also had a hit from someone in Stuttgart, Germany.  That is really neat-o because I lived there for 5 years (1989-1994) between the ages of 12 to 17. While I lived there the Berlin Wall came down, the first War on Iraq happened, I started drinking at age 14 and it was only two years later when I became legal to drink.  If you want, you can see what my blog would look like in  urlLink German .

      God, some of this is serious and some of this is not.  But it's all really important stuff so I really hope you're listening really hard.   First off, what's with all these  urlLink chicks  knitting these days? I feel so utterly out of the loop (get it, loop? there's looping involved in knitting, right?) because I don't knit and I don't know how to knit. I see how cool these chickies are with their mad knitting skillz and, of course, the resulting cool item of apparel that, when asked where they procured such a kick-ass garment, they can coolly reply, "I made it myself." So it makes me want to learn how to knit.  However, if I am to continue to pursue my never-ending dream of being "different" and "non-conformist" and despite how the idea of the different, non-conformist kind of girl taking part in an activity that was once known as something that only boring, mousy girls did (NOTE: this description does NOT include the wannabe awkward types, only the truly and naturally wallflowers!) is in and of itself different and non-conformist, BUT I am already so late to be jumping on the knitting bandwagon and therefore becoming a knitter at this point would be so very conformist and un-different.  It is the same reason I never got a belly-button piercing. The last thing I want, as a different and non-conforming kind of gal, is to be like everyone else. God, what is a kooky girl like me to do?  Perhaps you would like to see me learn how to cross-stitch or quilt instead as a way to fulfill my post as an intentionally awkward and yet irrationally perky girl? Please let me know as soon as you get done with my next request.  Last night in  urlLink church  (Is it a sin to go to church at night instead of the morning? ...I didn't think so.) the wonderful Pastor Kris pulled a story from the book of Acts about Paul and Cornelius (i think those are the right names) and how Paul's experience with the animals that were formerly known as "unclean" by the Jewish faith. The sermon first touched on how these stories are about the birth of "church" as we know it and then Kris went on to point out how Paul had to experience something new, something outside of the boundaries that had been established by his faith, his community and his comfort zone.  Kris then urged that we not shut out those different than ourselves, but instead reach out to them with love (even if not understanding).  I know that you know that my church is not  urlLink normal . It is a christian church of no particular denomination and the crowd that gathers there IS what is usually considered "those different than ourselves."  So instead of telling us to reach out to the street kids, the little druggies, the wackos in Little 5 Points, etc., he was telling us to love and pray for the stuffy, conservative suburbanites.  God, I don't know why I am always amazed at how beautifully you kick me right in the backs of my knees, causing me to drop down, humbled.  Because just the night before you had heard me go off on a verbal tirade about the stinky, creepy, nasty and heartless right wingers of this God-forsaken country.  I was sneering and practically spitting with disgust at all of the evil deeds of such self-righteous jackasses as the  urlLink Christian Coalition .  But then shouldn't I just be pointing the finger right back at myself?  How can I condemn people for condemning people?  What makes my slander more just than theirs?  Through Kris you gently reminded me: Nothing. It is not my job to judge.   And then you also gave me my new tattoo, the words: Fearless Love. I love that pairing of words.  How wonderfully pure and guided are those two words together!  It will serve as my reminder to myself to love and pray for my enemies. I so dearly want to be a beacon of love and acceptance to EVERYONE. Thank you God forever for your grace and guidance.  Thank you for shedding your light on me, even though I am still hesitant to see it sometimes. My request is this: please don't let me slip too far away from this place of loving everyman.  THANK YOU.  PS: please give peace and lightness to RM's heart today. I know he is coming to terms with his decision to go off the kidney therapy and "be done with it" and he needs some extra lifting up of his heavy heart, mind and soul.

      Today has been quite strange. I showed up to work and as usual I got on the 'net to see what had happened since I left work yesterday.  I check my email, check who has been to the blog, check other people's blogs and then I usually begin to type my first (of way too many) post of the day.  But I knew I had to wait today before I started typing. I knew that something else had to take place first. I am not even sure if "it" has happened yet, but so many things have taken place that it may be that upon reflection I will gain a greater sense of completion. I still feel a strong sense of some impending event. But I also have only an hour left before I leave for the weekend and am unable to write again for two days.  (I'll admit I am completely addicted to my blog/blogging.)  I decided that I was going to join group today.  Group is a daily activity we have at our AIDS Service Organization where we have guest speakers come by and share something with the group and then we discuss it.  All kinds of things are shared: personal stories, medical information, "scripture" (from all kinds of faiths from Baptist to Buddhist), music, massage, etc.  Today we had a man, Jerry, who leads meditation. He also "sees" people. Actually, I do not know what he calls what he does, but what I saw him do was that he'd suddenly "look into" a particular person, make observations and ask them questions.   Every observation ha made was confirmed by the person he was observing.  He noted how one person was especially sad, how another had a hard time letting people support him and how another person seemed to be full of relief.  He spoke with these people briefly and gave them advice about how they could work with these states.  He interspersed this with small meditations based on the chakras. During the second meditation he came over to me and placed his hand on my upper chest and his other hand in my hand. Even long after he walked over to help someone else, it felt like there was something in the palm of my hand, like a small ball of energy.  Then, towards the end of the hour, he turned to me.  He looked at me with great intensity, not in a creepy or invasive way, just with a lot of power and love. You have to look away every few seconds, it's so powerful.   Then he said (I am paraphrasing), "You are a great light. It is very bright and very special.  But you give too much of it away and you do not give enough to yourself. Your light is always on and people will take it from you, even if they don't mean to. You have a pure heart. People all around you benefit from it and they are always grateful for it. You need to know that, even if you don't hear it all the time. You need to make sure you are benefiting from it as well."    In reply I uttered,” I need to be reminded to do that."  He continued,” You need to remind yourself.  It is something that does not come naturally to you and making sure you take care of yourself is something you will have to work on for the rest of your life. You are very special and we need for you to take care of yourself so your light doesn't go out."  I let my overwhelmed face fall into my hand, still looking at him and trying to take in what he's said.  He lingered on, looking at me for several more seconds.  I swear he was telling me more with his eyes, but because it was communication without words, I can't and won't even attempt to "translate."  And no, he wasn't flirting with me. He's as gay as a goose (one of our fave phrases over here) and was as sincere with everyone else, even those he didn't directly address. Group ended with a lovely gospel, "Sweet Spirit," sung by the two ladies who HOME COOKED and brought lunch today.  Most everyone had a smile plastered on their face and we all gave each other hugs as we always do after group.  Jerry came over to me and hugged me and said, "We need more people like you. Please let yourself feel what everyone else does from you."  I wanted to come right up and write about it (though writing about it does seem pompous) but JM was on the phone having a panic attack. Luckily I was in a very good space, so I talked him through it as best I could over the phone.  I was happy to do because even just this morning I was thinking about all of the really thoughtful things he's done for me and how I feel like I don't stop and really appreciate it.    He writes me little notes or gives me fun little cards, he brings over little gifts of things I may have said I like in a random conversation (I mentioned randomly once that I have the hardest time finding REAL Hostess Twinkies and the next day he brought over a pack of them. I LOVE the SMALL things, that's what tells me someone cares.) ...and best of all, he really does communicate with me.  Even if it takes him a little while to figure out what he's feeling or thinking, he shares as much as he can when he can.  That is saying a helluva lot for a guy, heck, anyone really.  He shared with me that he feels left out lately.  Partially because I haven't let him see the blog. I had decided to not show it to him because I wanted to have a space to vent if I needed to. And he respects that, so we came up with a compromise and that makes me happy.  I hope it works for him as well. I hung up with him feeling like I actually helped him.   The rest of the day was spent saving participants in crisis. That is my job, after all.  People rarely call me when things are going well (except for P, who is my special friend because he is a paranoid drunk, so I can't place him with a volunteer team, so it's just me and him, which is fine by me.  He called me once just to say that he was writing me a thank you note that he'll probably never send. I don't think he trusts the USPS...). What I' trying to get at is how I felt like I spent the rest of the day shining on other people, which was the opposite of what Jerry suggested I do. All in good time though.  I have decided to work on making my light into a lighthouse light.  That way it can be more focused and swoop around, shining sometimes outside and sometimes in. Have a lovely weekend, friends!

      I have to brag about this little thing we call  urlLink The Fry-a-Thon  (i fixed the link!).  It's an amazingly disgustingly good time where a group of friends come together to fry anything and everything we can think of. Last year the major epiphany was that Fried Spam is gross. Not because it is fried, but because it is SPAM.  We've done it twice now, the last time having yet to be documented (Feb 8th, 2003 and May 15th 2004).  This is a list of what we fried this time around: 1. Funnel Cakes 2. Peaches 3. Strawberries 4. Pineapples 5. Apples 6. Twinkies 7. Pillsbury dough  8. Alligator (Crikey!) 9. Onion Rings 10. Battered Green Onions 11. White Castle Burgers (battered) 12. Steak & Cheese Hot pockets 13. Battered Hot dogs 14. Patio-brand frozen burritos 15. Sweet ghurkens 16. Buffalo Chicken wings 17. Chicken Pot pie 18. PB&J Smuckers brand Crustables 19. Mozarella sticks 20. Totino's Pizza rolls 21. TGIF brand rolled quesadillas 22. Shrimp and mushrooms (battered) 23. Battered Klondike bars. 24. Bananas 25. Boca Burgers 26. Cheese Ravioli 27. Some sort of Chicken Kiev (veggies wrapped in Chicken)   I am proud of my contribution of the White Castle Burgers (much like the Krystal burgers in the south).  They were thoroughly gross.  The meat was dry and the buns had become sponges full of grease. The UnCrustables were the best!  They're PB&J sandwich pockets and the peanut butter got all warm and gooey from the heat of the boiling oil.  YUM! I left at 5pm after having eaten greasy foods of all kinds since noon with only the added benefit of a lot of Miller Lite to soothe my tummy. Needless to say I went right to bed and stayed there like a lump of lard until 10pm when I woke up and ate the biggest salad ever.  The next day my only goal was to drink as much wheatgrass juice and beer as possible. Yet another successful weekend of wasting my life away for the benefit of your enjoyment!  Everybody SING: Fish heads! Fish heads! Roly Poly Fishheads! Fish heads! Fish heads! Eat them up, YUM!

      I just found this page by doing a reverse look-up of what people have put into a search engine and wound up finding me (fag hag codependent was the search) and came across this  urlLink page .  I would really like to know what this yallara chick is up to with all these words.  And I wonder why I assume yallara is a female.

      Yesterday proved to be not so fun. It all started when I found myself outside of that safe haven I call the city.  I was in themiddleoffreakingnowhere, GA (40 minutes out of the city of Atlanta) and was on my way back from visiting two folks in my program (very sweet fellows, I might add) and thinking of how much I was looking forward to an evening of wieners and balls (aka eating corndogs and bowling), when I noticed the cheap gas prices (since when is $1.89 Gal for 87 grade CHEAP?!) and decided to fill up my tank.  I was in the store getting a bottle of water when some dude ran in the back door and yelled, "He's got a gun!"  Yes, you read correctly.  G-U-N.  Everyone looked around frantically because we didn't know where the gun-toting man was.  Then people were yelling, "He's outside in the back!"  So I made a b-line to the front door until another man ran into me saying, "He's on the side of the building!" SO I ran back inside.  At this point the 10 or so people that were inside with me were also running around and running into each other, none of us knowing what was happening or what to do.  BLAM!  The gun was shot. The sound made the reality of the situation sink deep into my heart:  My life was officially in danger.  I ran to the bathroom and locked the flimsy door behind me. Once inside the bathroom, I looked at my options.  There was no window to crawl out of and no stalls to hide in.  I decided that if this guy was on a rampage he might just shoot through the door so I decided to stand beside the door, so the bullets would not necessarily have a direct path into ME.  The light and noisy fan was on, so I couldn't hear what was going on outside.  I stood there for about eternity (=less than 5 minutes), trembling.  By now the reality had sunk to my gut - I swear, if things had escalated any more, I could have crapped my pants. Now I will never make fun of people who piss or crap themselves in a bank robbery ever again. A most humbling realization indeed.  I turned the fan off and could hear that people were talking in normal tones outside, so I poked my head out. People were coming out of the hiding places and so I stepped out of the bathroom.  What was weird was how some folks were walking around like nothing had happened.  I don't know if this was because they are used to this or if they were in shock. I did notice how quickly I wanted to "normalize" the situation internally and externally.    We all turned as the guy now ran out -sans gun- from the side of the building to the front with three men chasing after him with sticks (we in the country now!).  He ran across the divided highway and stayed there until the police showed up.  I scurried over to the cashier and said, "Let me pay so I can get out of here.  I just got out of the city and y'all are crazier than we are!"  I hopped in my car and drove away in disbelief.  The whole ordeal lasted less than 15 minutes.  A weird thing is that I didn't have any thoughts of the end of my life, nor did I experience any strong feelings of how precious life is and that kind of stuff.  I did call my family, but mainly to tell them the crazy story.  I didn't feel the need to call everyone I know to tell them I love them, nor did I have a renewed sense of life.  The biggest realization I had was how frustrated I felt that I didn't know what to do and how helpless that made me feel.  No one banded together or felt any sense of safety in the group.  I was stuck in a convenience store with a bunch of strangers who were all alone in their efforts to survive. I guess if the whole thing had lasted longer, we would have wound up bonding, but in this case everyone splintered off. And hey, I just realized that not one single man took care of the safety of the women.  In fact it was a woman who diffused the situation.  I don't know how I feel about that.  Later I went bowling and I SUCKED.   ...i don't like this game.

      My job is a strange one. I am basically a match-maker between folks who are home-bound due to AIDS and volunteers who wish to help them. It is very rewarding and even more frustrating. There is such joy when I am able to tell one of the folks who are on the waiting list that I have found a volunteer team for them.  It is sad that happens so infrequently.  It is not surprising though.  When I go out and recruit volunteers I am basically asking that they go into the home of a stranger and befriend someone who has AIDS and often other opportunistic illnesses who is also in the last stages of their life. The volunteer must face the harsh reality that the person they are caring for goes through everyday such as weakness, blindness, neuropathy, dementia, mood swings and other common effects of late-stage AIDS. Often these folks have no one else left in the world for them.  Especially if they are gay, they have often already been shunned by their family and have already lost their partner and many friends due to AIDS. I have met people who became infected in the "first wave," that time in the mid 80's when no one knew just yet how you got it, who went through a time in the early 90's when nearly everyone they knew was dropping like flies.  Gay churches began holding mass memorials because there were just too many people dying to do individual ones.  Sometimes I feel like I've been let in on one of the biggest secrets of the gay community by knowing all this.  But then I realize that it wasn't that they were trying to keep it from us (read: white suburban America), but that we just didn't want to hear it. This ugly reality is one that those in the gay community pretty much have carried all by themselves, with little help from the rest of the world.  And now a shift has happened.  The demographics have changed from "gay white boys” to straight black men and women.  And I am afraid that the same vicious cycle will happen all over again: lack of information, lack of acceptance, lack of proper health care = rampant spread of the disease until the numbers are so high that big chunks of that population are gone.   And yet we continue to not give our school children access to proper and REAL sex education. We continue to deny them access to LIFE SAVING condoms.  Instead of making condom use normal and acceptable, we give propel the bad reputation of condoms.   I used to live in Germany and for five years I was inundated with teen magazines that blew my little American mind. They had regular columns about losing your virginity, letters sent in with questions about sex and love to which open and honest answers were given, there was even a section called "Photo Love Story" where a couple would meet, go on a date and then have some serious heavy petting during which they would undress- all shown in photos with little speech bubbles. I just went to the website of the main teen magazine, Bravo. I am including a  urlLink link  to a page called "Body Check" (oh yeah, they use A LOT of English to make the German language seem cooler).  You will see an option to click on an internet connection (Modem, ISDN, DSL) - click on one.    There they are. Totally "normal" German kids NAKED.  Why?  This is a column that allows other kids to see what is normal about their changing bodies.  There are descriptions of other effects of puberty like random erections and sore nipples. Basically it is a strange mix of child porn (?) and encouragement to feel comfortable in your skin.  And they LOVE condoms.  They make all kinds of different condoms available so that instead of being deathly embarrassing to buy and use them, it's FUN!  And the strangest part of all this? The parents are not only NOT against it, they fully SUPPORT it.  Mmmm. An entire population that is comfortable with their bodies, sex and condoms...sounds like it's time to head to the NUDE BEACH!    Seriously though.  What the heck is wrong with America that we can't allow ourselves to be human? I'll tell you what it is: wackos like the Christian Coalition who don't want condoms being distributed, don't want to provide safe abortions, don't want to teach real sex ed and then don't want to pay for the ENORMOUS health care bills of teenage pregnant mothers or those infected with HIV/AIDS, or worse, teenage pregnant mothers with HIV/AIDS who will give birth to a BABY with HIV/AIDS.  Can a public policy get any more freaking ridiculous than that?  No my friend, it cannot.

      Went to the divorce support group last night. I am not supposed to talk about anyone else in the group, but I can talk about what I said, which was nothing new.  Y'all have already heard everything I shared last night with the group. I imagine it will take some time before any of us get down to the meat of our situation.   I also spent last night alone.  I was freaked out at first. I did not want to go to bed all by myself.  The apartment suddenly seemed so dark.  I have two doors (a front door and a back door) and that made me feel even more vulnerable. So I turned on the porch lights and the bathroom light abd shut my bedroom door.  I put my head down on the pillow convinced that I wasn't going to sleep well and fell asleep right away (a feat in and of itself for me).  I woke up at 3am because it was damn hot. I had turned off my A/C earlier because it was damned cold.  But it was comforting to wake and find my kitty, Lily, sleeping at my feet.   I have two cats: Lily and Lorca.  Lorca is all white, has tiny, tiny paws and instead of meowing, she whines. It's annoying and to be honest with you, if she didn't have the strange knack for playing fetch like a dog, I really wouldn't like her at all.  Then there's my Lily-girl.  She's sweet.  She is white with a huge black blotch all over her back and half of her face.  She sleeps most of the time and eats the rest of the time.  Occasionally she feels the need to come over to wherever I may be and rub her face on everything nearby, especially when I am using the bathroom.    Chris and I also had the best cat ever for a short while, Japhy. He was a true rescue kitty, found in a storm drain in a tropical storm clinging for dear life on a tree limb.  He was a Maine Coon cat, which is the official name for "Coolest Cat EVER." He loved cuddling and playing and being damn cool. He had HUGE paws and his big, furry ears looked cute on his little kitten head. Maine Coon cats are kind of rare and can get to be as big as 30lbs. Check the  urlLink Maine Coon Breed   out. Sadly, we had to put him down when he was only a few months old because he developed FIP. I am not sure exactly what it is, but basically he began only retaining fluids in his tummy and lungs and was otherwise completely dehydrated and there was nothing we could do.  It may have even been why he was abondoned in the first place because normally Maine Coons are very expensive.   It was a very, very sad time.  I felt his little head go limp in my hand. We buried him in Chris' mom's backyard with pictures of us and his "sisters," his favorite toy (a Tiger beanie baby that he would drag around), and some treats for the "after life" Egyptian style. Now I am sad.

      I am proud of my cleverness and so must share: Everyone knows that the crisper should really be called the "rotter."  Even my mother's immaculate fridge has been known to suffer from this sad state of affairs. That's why I only keep non-rotting things in there and all of the rot-able things on the top shelf where I can easily see them and be reminded of how yet another day has passed without my having cooked or eaten anything fresh (unless you count Subway sandwiches). PS:I still have yet to own a vacuum. I think I might organize an archeological dig in my carpets soon. I am missing a remote control and a cat.

      "Go easy. You may have to push forward, but you don't have to push so hard. Go in gentleness, go in peace.  Do not be in so much of a hurry. At no day, no hour, no time are you required to do more than you can do in peace.  Frantic behaviors and urgency are not the foundation for our new way of life.  Do not be in too much of a hurry to begin. Begin, but do not force the beginning if it is not time. Beginnings will arrive soon enough.  Enjoy and relish middles, the heart of the matter.  Do not be in too much of a hurry to finish. You may be almost done, but enjoy the final moments. Give yourself fully to those moments so that you may give and get all there is.  Let the pace flow naturally. Move forward. Start. Keep moving forward. Do it gently, though. Do it in peace. Cherish each moment.  Today, God, help me focus on a peaceful pace rather than a harried one. I will keep moving forward gently, not frantically. Help me let go of my need to be anxious, upset, and harried. Help me replace it with a need to be at peace and in harmony."  -From the book, "The Language of Letting Go" by Melody Beattie (can be found at www.Hazelden.org)

      Ok. There's quite a bit to talk about today. I have to start with the worry that's been on my mind since Thursday. I have reason to believe that the link to this website may have fallen into the "wrong" hands. I have been sick to my stomach about this all weekend. Really.  I feel like I could vomit RIGHT NOW.  I am not sure if I want to publicly speculate about who the "wrong" hands belong to, but let's just say that it is someone (or persons) that could take what I have written here the wrong way and maybe even have their feelings hurt. I would like to be able to say in my defense that this person wouldn't know what I went through with Chris, BUT this person probably does know because they've gone through it too, in their own way.  I know I am being very cryptic, but let's just say I have really learned my lesson about who to pass my link on to.  I feel horrible, but I also know that if I went on and tried to defend myself, it would wind up being a case of how I "doth protest too much."  I am sorry that certain information may have come to light that may have created ugly feelings.  However I am not sorry for what I have done.  I know, in my heart of hearts, I did EVERYTHING I possibly could to save my marriage and that when all of my heart had bled out from trying, my decisions all ultimately had to do with what I needed to do for my sake.  Selfish?  Perhaps.  Necessary? YES, for the sake of my sanity, self-preservation and general well-being.  I know there are people out there who can understand, even if not accept or like, what I have done.  I hope we can all move ahead somehow with understanding and peace - though I imagine this will take time. I am deeply sorry that things turned out like this because I know that I would do everything all over again if I thought for one minute that it would have worked out. I did and do love him after all.  I have to steer away from that now because I am not only working on forgiving others, but also myself and so I have to let it go.  My dear friend from college, Anna, was in town all last week. On Thursday we had a girl's night out.   Oh wait- I have to interrupt here- I was at Media Play yesterday and on their front doors they had huge posters announcing they "BUY'S and SELL'S used CDs and DVDs."  DEAR GOD'S!!!  Back to the night out - we went to an open-mic night at "My Sister's Room" (a lesbian bar/club) where I fell in love with Tiffany Shea's  urlLink nose  (she was the lead singer of one of the bands,  urlLink Tiffany Shea Band ). Then we went to Hoedown's and witnessed a league of lesbians line dancing to pop music. Literally! But the thought that kept creeping back into my mind that night had a lot to do with Tiffany's lyrics. Heart wrenching for the most part, it made me wonder why it is so much more "easy" to write about difficult times than good times.  I know that when I am going through a rough period, I write like a banshee, but when things are good, I hardly write at all.   Last but not least - it has been decided, after long discussion and some tears, that JM and I will be giving each other more "room." In other words, more time away from each other.  I need it and he needs it (he just doesn't know it yet). I get tonight off for my divorce support group, he gets tomorrow night off for his grief counseling, on Wednesdays we'll go bowling together (whee!I've really started to like it!), and I am not sure about the rest of the week. But it's two days at least and I am heppy about that (yes, heppy, dernit!).  MUST GET SOME WORK DONE....I know I'll feel really good and productive once I get started...it's the getting started part that sucks. Sigh.

      Chris just called to say that he is flying back today and probably won't be back for a year. He then asked if there was anything else I needed from him or anything else he could do for me. Was this some sort of genuine kindness he was showing me? No. I know that this is.  It is the same thing he always did. He would attack me and then get up on a high horse, almost even taking pity on me. Can you say man-ip-u-la-tive?  We finished the conversation with your basic Karpman's Drama Triangle: he tells me he'll stop reacting this way if I stop acting this way (I'm not even sure what actions he's referring to) and then I gently remind him that I cannot make him feel any particular way; that his reactions are his choice. I wish him a safe flight and good luck and hang up.  It is so unbelievably strange to find myself here in this emotional space, feeling like I do towards a man who I once promised my life to and now hardly know. It hurts in so many ways. My anger and frustration shoot through me like darts. I cannot wait for my support group on Monday.  Again,  at this very moment, I am reminding myself that I have chosen to respond to him with love, instead of sit here and respond negatively. To respond with loving thoughts and prayers for him. I know this is what I must do in order to heal, and hopefully also open up some sort of path of healing for him as well.  I care about what happens to him. I care about how he feels. I care deeply about his wellbeing.    I believe everything happens for a reason. And I believe that my experince with Chris has taught me many things (is it just me, or am I continually sounding like Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid?). The things I have learned have been difficult yet positve. I have a much better handle on my co-dependency and certian quirks. I now know that I don't have to give up my personal identity to be with someone. That I can be an individual and be in a relationship at the same time.  I hope I will not let myself be so manipulated again in the name of love.  My eyes are open.  Of course there are always more mistakes we can learn from and I open myself to that truth as well.  I am looking forward to this weekend. Though it is official that I miss being able to blog on the weekends since I don't have a computer. It forces me to go back to my diary though which is good. I wish everyone a safe and happy weekend and look forward to seeing you again on Monday. Sing it with me!  It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, A beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine? Could you be mine?...  It's a neighborly day in this beauty wood, A neighborly day for a beauty. Would you be mine? Could you be mine?...  I've always wanted to have a neighbor just like you. I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.  So, let's make the most of this beautiful day. Since we're together we might as well say: Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor? Won't you please, Won't you please? Please won't you be my neighbor?   -my inner 7 year old and my outer 27 year old Thank You Mr. Rogers http://pbskids.org/rogers/

      Yuckiness aside, I have to brag about how I have a cool way to track how many people see my blog. It's so detailed that you can even find out who a visitor is/where they are/when they've accessed the page/how many times they've come back, etc. I've had visitors from all over, even the Netherlands, which is totally cool.  (I could tell you how to do this, but I'd have to kill you. >>Insert evil laugh here

      I realize that perhaps my previous post may be a bit much to start out on, so I have devised a clever distraction!  First I'll make an update about JM: after arguing for the nth time last night we finally got to the meat of the problem: 1) he has hit a brick wall about his mother's passing. It's coming up on one year since she died of cancer and it's catching up to him. (more on that, maybe. I think it's actually his thing and its not really my place to share his business) 2) He has also hit a brick wall in that he wants something from me that I cannot give: my heart. I don't have it to give. It's lost somewhere in a land of confusion (I think we all know why). He knew this when we started seeing each other, but I think it's really starting to affect him. And this is a perfect example of why I KNEW I shouldn't get involved with any one in any way for a while (but since when do I pay attention to common sense?) I really didn't want to be in any kind of relationship and I sure as heck wasn't looking (typical) and yet here I am dealing with a man in my life. (yes, I like parenthesis. leave me alone.) But hey, we'll talk about it and deal with it the best we can.  I am doing much better right now than I was doing this morning and that is good.  I am looking forward to a little drinky-drinky tonight and my boss has already said I can come in late to work tomorrow (God bless the lady- she knows about what's happened with Chris and she's so cool about everything).  Ta.

      Fucking motherfucking fucker.   I walked in to work this morning and as I made my way to the stairs I see Chris barreling up the front sidewalk towards me. I freeze in the hallway and just wait for him to come inside. He gives me a cold look as he hands me two papers before he turned around and walked right back out.  One I see right away is the final divorce paper.  The other is a small note that reads: “You got what you want. You’re a fake, a quitter and an adulterer. Just like your father. I forgive you everything but I’ll never forget what you’ve done. I have nothing more to say to you. – Chris” I am so stricken with anger and hurt.  Does that sound like forgiveness to you? What the FUCK. What about what he’s done? What about how he destroyed me? What about how he sabotaged the relationship? What about all of the fucking outrageous things he did that hurt me/us? And to come to my workplace to do this… what the FUCK!!!! I HATE HIM. He ruined my life. He ruined my heart. But you know what, I am stronger now. So I sound like a Christina Aguilera song, but so the fuck what. I have learned to be my own person in a relationship.  That I don’t have to lie down and die for the person I love. PS: yes, this is an infantile rant. I don't care. It's in me and it has to come out.  But you know, I look around me and see what I have in my life and how much better it is without him and his deceitful and destructive ways and I am grateful to have what I have.  I have a wonderful job with wonderful people. I have great friends who stand by me and are there for me. I have my health. I have good food to eat and a great place to lay my head at night. And I have my self. I have a mouth to smile with, arms to hug with, ears to listen and learn with, eyes to see the beauty all around me and a heart to love with. I choose love RIGHT NOW. At this very moment I am choosing to love Chris. He can stab at me with his words and I may hurt, but instead of trying in vain to heal these wounds by wounding him, I choose to heal with love and compassion.  He is clearly already in pain and that is why he is lashing out. So I am going to pray for him, that he can feel better and stronger and see clearly why this has happened and what he can learn from it and move on in love, just as I am.   My God I love writing. I love it dearly. It is my catalyst for catharsis. The page is my tool for change and growth. It is my therapy, my outlet, my friend, my lover. Some people meditate or read or have a hobby to give themselves the space to reflect, to take it all in and let it all out. The page is all of those things to me.  A blank page is beautiful and ugly and comforting and unsettling, but always ultimately good for me. Thank you for letting me share.

      For the past 5 days JM and I have been stumbling all over this damn topic of me and this guy Robert. And my friend Anna and his friend Momorie (MO-Maurie). He thinks I am always in danger of hooking up with these people.  Actually, what it's all about his some fear that is controlling his actions and feelings. Let's talk about FEAR for a moment.  I have been learning a lot about the power of fear in a person's life.  I think that most anything that most people do is out of fear. I KNOW that most everything bad/negative/destructive/unproductive/selfish that a person does is out of fear. Often the cause of the fear is not so very obvious and perhaps at times the fear is not really from anything - it's just FEAR. People react to fear in many ways, though usually with some sort of excess: eating too much, eating too little, drinking too much, working too much, sleeping with lots of people, going to church too often, becoming violent, becoming reclusive, anything where other things/people suffer as a result of the other thing.  People are sometimes so run by fear that they spend most of their existence avoiding it.  My stepmother is a great example.  Her pace in life is so frantic; it's stressful to be around her. She always has to be talking, doing, getting something done. She doesn't like watching movies. Why? Because two hours of not actively running away from fear is hard for her. She can't even escape in the movie (isn't that why most people watch movies?) She doesn't enjoy life because she's not living. Hell, I'm a great example.   I spent much of my single years picking guys up in bars. I was a full-on Samantha (from Sex and the City). Why? Because I was trying to cover up or get away from my fear. In the meantime I became empty.  I had shut off my emotions because they got in the way. My fear led me to not be picky enough about the men I chose to "be with."  Its sickness, but it is so embedded and natural in each and every person that we don't see it. So what can you do? You can take the time to find out where your fear stems from. You can also recognize the harmful things you do as a result of the fear and practice not doing them, actively choosing to not live and act out of fear.  You should live out of LOVE.    LOVE is the true opposite of FEAR.  I know you think the opposite of love is hate, but hate is really just a manifestation of fear. To crudely paraphrase a great quote I heard somewhere: "One cannot simultaneously live out of love and out of fear." You have to choose between the two. It's just that most of us aren't even aware that we are living out of fear, much less that we have a choice. And because living out of fear is so deeply ingrained into our very being, it is difficult to make the choice and even more difficult to stick with it.  But it's worth it. Living out of love means you are no longer driven to take part in destructive behavior, that you are now free to live your life, that you feel more love in yourself, for yourself and for others. You feel compelled to do the right thing, take the high road, and stay away from negative influences.    The next time you feel like you're doing something that is out of control take a moment, step back from the situation and what you're feeling and ask yourself, "Am I doing this/feeling this way out of fear?" Have a little conversation with yourself before you just act/react. Check in with yourself. Validate your feelings, but don't let your feelings take the place of common sense. LOVE is not just a fuzzy warm feeling, but a way of LIFE!  Speaking of fear and love... Tomorrow is D-Day. The divorce should be final as long as Chris doesn't lose his shit and kill me. I actually had nightmares about that last night.   (In other news, I bought a fantastic little handmade vintage apron yesterday! It's from the '50s (I think) and is red and white striped. I am using it as a valance over my kitchen door - it really ties in my use of red as an accent color.)

      I love this post from  urlLink amylovesbooks  about using words like very, a lot and really and I wanted to share the comment I made in response: "I do the same thing, except for me it is because I lack the better word to express what I want. It is likely that my vocabulary is simply too stunted to think of the better word, the word that will make the reader stop breathing for that split second as the word seeps into a deeper part of them. I always wish that I can somehow create a mainline from that deeper part of me to that deeper part of the reader. I know it can be done, because I have been on the receiving end, just as I was now with your post."

      Actually I am less sad than I am annoyed, but that was a really funny quote from The Daily Show last night.  JM is a total jealous freak and it's driving me nuts.  It's so annoying I don't even want to get into it - Let's just say that he's now promised to trust me to take care of the situation with the creepy old guy on my own. The latest is: Robert called me at work yesterday and said he wanted to take me out to lunch at some fancy place on Wednesday. I am normally a pro at kindly turning guys down - don't want to be a bitch about it, but I am also not a pushover - but I am not trained in this kind of advance, so I fell all over myself and wasn't effective in shutting him down. I am used to young guys being all slimy and stupid in their approach but not older, well-versed men. Even if it is still all slimy. He's calling back today and I am READY.  Prepare for termination, pal.  But I am still seething about all of these circular convos with JM. When he gets all jealous and suspicious about everything that I really just want to run away. I am not used to this kind of scrutiny and I am so not in the mood to deal with other people's issues (he had two girlfriends that cheated on him in the past) - shit, I can barely deal with my own issues. Not to mention this whole divorce thing.  Speaking of divorce: I didn't go to the support group yesterday.  I went to the wrong church and by the time I realized it, I was really late.  But I did have all of the pain and anguish anyway: shooting pain in my chest, shortness of breath, and a pounding headache.  Maybe I should get back on my Wellbutrin. But I think I just really need one wonderfully silly night of good pot, good friends and a good laugh.   Okay, now on to something that is possibly actually entertaining: WORD OF THE DAY!  I love new words. They make me happy.  Today's word is LOOP - A person who has acquired enough cocktail knowledge to impress people for an entire party.  However, if you spend more time with them, you come to realize they wind up repeating themselves once they run through their initial set of impressive information, thus becoming like a looped video. Much like the kind you see at the cheesy make-up counter at the mall. These people are shallow and needy and have not realized the importance of developing themselves for their own sake.  (this WOTD was made possible by Ryan and Kyle from LA, CA)  And now I just want to fall up into the sky.

      Chris called a few hours ago to tell me that the divorce should be final sometime Thursday (6/10/04). I thanked him and he just said, "Good bye."  Two words: Relief and sadness. More on that later.  Also, doing some browsing I found  urlLink pinkhairedgirl . She has been blogging since JULY 2001.  Whoa.  An entry reminded me of Omar. I'll have to tell you about him someday. Perhaps the best way to sum up this ex-boyfriend of mine who died in a horrible car wreck (of his making in which no one else was involved or hurt in a Porsche he had stolen) would be with the "porn name" he was given by some porn name website: Lesbian Pimp.    Righteous.

      My sincerest apologies to the original  urlLink notsopinkanymore .I am surprised as well - didn't know it was possible to double-up on website names like that.  Well, at least people will now have a choice when they google the title - they can either read about a boring divorce or flat-hunting.  PS: to e_b and DJ - thank you for your kind words. That's very sweet.  Also: Sorry to bore you midgetcircus. I forgot I was writing just for your entertainment. Silly bugger.  Cheers!

      My mind is actually blank right now.  Or perhaps it is simply too full. Saturday was an interesting day.  My non-profit agency held a fundraiser art auction. I showed up at noon to help unload the art from the truck. There were two young men from the art gallery to help out - one of them was the son of the owner of the art gallery.  The son couldn't have been more than 19 years old, but he was still making eyes at me, which I thought was cute. (come to find out later that he didn't think I was over 20 years old, so I guess that's why he was doing that) I was just nice to him, but tried my best to make sure I wasn't leading him on. (have you ever noticed that sometimes people take someone being simply nice to them as a an "in"...?  I get in trouble with that all the time. Maybe I'm just too nice? But that's a whole other convo for later-)  Fast forward to later that night at the auction itself. By now I've cleaned up and put on my little black dress for the event. That's when the kid's dad showed up and basically took over for his son.  This man was the biggest flirt I'd met in a long time.  It was WEIRD. Getting hit on by a son and his dad in the same day is awkward at best. Not to mention the ages were both all wrong.  19 and 42. But this guy, Robert, was relentless.  He kept making comments about how wholesome I looked (granted, you couldn't see any of my tattoos and I was wearing pearls), but with a wink in his eye as if to say he'd work some of that wholesomeness right out of me.  The flirting officially became nasty when he sat down next to me (I was keeping track of the purchases during the auction) and made a comment about how sloppy his handwriting was and therefore a testament to his not being gay (note: the gay to straight ratio that night was about 5:1).  At this point I was getting pissy and retorted, "Oh, I thought it was the wedding band you're wearing that made that clear."  But he just fired back with, "That and the heavy flirtation." Wink, wink.  Eeeeeewwww. Okay, I must say right now that someone being 42 years old actually doesn't pose a problem to me by itself.  However, back when I was actively dating, I made 35 my cut-off age.  I did this simply and only because it would just be too damn weird to date some one that was closer in age to my stepfather than to me (my stepdad, Holger, is 40-something).  What really topped the night off with this guy was his flat-out admission of being an alcoholic womanizer.  Woo-hoo, hold me back. And I haven't escaped him yet: He's supposedly coming by my office this week to drop off some of the art, so I am working on  not  being here for that.  After I left the auction I met up with JM somewhere out in Alpharetta (a suburb of Atlanta) where he proceeded to get all bent out of shape again about my friend who is coming to visit. Who happens to be a lesbian. And I had a girlfriend (not her) once.  He has been all up in arms about the fact that I am not going to make her sleep on the short sofa and therefore she will be sharing my bed with me. I am not sure if he is more upset about this wacko idea of his that she and I would get it on or that we would get it on without him. So that was Saturday.  Sunday was very lazy and involved only two things: food and bed-time. Very much needed.  In Divorce News: Tonight I have my first meeting at a divorce support group.  I have no idea how this will work out. I hope it is helpful in my dealing with it in that I do not walk away feeling guiltier. Though I also do not expect to walk away feeling less guilty either. The group is hosted by a Presbyterian church, and I hope we touch upon the faith aspect as well. I already looked up what the bible has to say about divorce and the brief version (from what I can tell) is this: It was once said to be not so bad sin-wise, but that was then denounced as false info that was given just because God was just trying to get people to see what the real issues were and didn't want people to get so hung up on stuff like that. So the end result is that it IS a sin and should not be done. As I understand it I am now a shamed woman who would be lucky to be redeemed if a man were to marry me. Sounds harsh, but I think it's just the way people understood things then and also a way to impress upon people now the goodness of trying to work things out and taking marriage seriously.  I know that I HAD to leave so I wouldn't lose my shit. I had been utterly and nearly completely broken.    Speaking of which, I saw a lady at the Laundromat yesterday who clearly had an eating disorder. She truly was skin and bones (she was about 5'6" and could not have weighed more than 85 lbs).  My heart ached to see her walk with such deliberate movement, as if there was nothing to cushion her bones and joints. She was there with a healthy-looking man. I hate to assume that he is to blame, but how can I not? Who could allow someone they're with to deteriorate like that?  I so dearly wanted to help  somehow , but could not. I feared that any words would make her world more dangerous, especially if the man is part of the problem.  I am working on becoming more concise. I have a feeling that my posts are too damn long. But so it is for now. My apologies!

      Before I get into anything - I saw that I had written Chris' name (otherwise referred to as CB). I was trying to offer him some semblance of privacy, despite his photo already being on the page (you can't see him that well).  But I've kind of blown his cover now and really I don't think it matters since I am using my middle name (which hardly anyone knows) on here anyway. This is my formal apology for any and all similar "mistakes" I have and will continue to make.  I guess I'll just not use any last names at least. ok.  I have been wanting to communicate with Chris for some time.  There is nothing stranger about tearing yourself away from someone you are close with than the harsh fact that the one person you would normally go to when you are going through a difficult time is the one person you cannot go to anymore. This morning JM left early for work and so I got ready alone for the first time in a while. I felt very alone. It made me want to call Chris, but I knew I had absolutely nothing to say to him. What do you say after all to the person you are divorcing? And then a song came to mind that Chris had said was how he thought of me: Gerry Rafferty's "Right Down the Line."  It's Gerry singing about how his special lady had stayed by him through all of his ups and downs. It's a very nice song with a lovely message of thanks. The thought of the song makes me very, very sad. I truly wish that I could have hung in there for the long haul with Chris. But that would have required super-human strength.  I truly believe that only God and Jesus could have/will have sustained a relationship with him. As hard as I tried not to take Chris' actions personally, as hard as I tried to not be a critical bitch, as hard as I tried to support him when he would stumble and fall again - I could not.  And I was sick, too.  I had become codependent royale. (who else is thinking of Pulp Fiction right now?)  I had become the very thing I had always vowed never to become: a nagging, screaming, harsh monster of a woman. ( I would like to insert here that I am lucky to say that does not describe my Mother. except when I was really asking for it.) I was out of control. Still to this day it enrages me to think of how he was incapable of doing the damn dishes. It's crazy, but that was one of our major arguments. You see though - it was a sign of his sickness. How else can you explain someone who only works one shift a week and yet does not find time or energy to do the dishes? They would sit there for days on end, just getting more gross and accumulating.   When I noticed that he had a hard time doing this, we actually coverd this as an issue in our couples counseling. It was decided that we would switch days of dish duty. One day me, one day him. (we even defined "day" = one full load of dishes)  NOTE: we did not have a dishwahser, so you did have to actually wash them by hand, but still - we didn't cook that much and when we did it was basic stuff that required two pots at most. The point is that even basic daily duties were beyond him. And what did I do? Pick up the slack and get pissed off about it. I made sure the bills were paid, cleaned the apartment, worked cleaning other people's houses, waited tables, did the grocery shopping, all of those things that normal do as a matter of course. And I got angrier and angrier at him. It was bad all around. Now I've gone off ranting again. I really am trying to stick to sorting through my feelings instead of just blasting Chris.  The thing is, I never wanted to be that angry at him. I'd just promised to spend the rest of my life with him - and I took my vows VERY seriously - and here I was at war with the person I loved and cared about the most. I now see how that was the problem. I certainly wasn't loving and caring to myself and hadn't been for some time. If you asked me how I felt, I'd tell you how he was. Everything I did was tailored around him. What I ate, when I ate, when I went to sleep, what I liked and disliked what I listened to, what I watched and ulitmately how I was as person. I have to run and I probably won't be able to post this weekend (don't cry) since I only have my computer at work.

      I finally figured out how to add links.  I also apparently figured out how to add a link bulletpoint sans a link.  I wasn't even trying to add links in those spaces. As far as I can tell there is no difference in the html between the first few links and the last ones that have the spaces between them. Anyone?

      Good morning.  I am totally wiped out this morning – as usual.  I don’t know why, but I am almost always tired when I wake up these days.  I think it may have to do with how I have been responding to my alarm clock.  I set it for 7:30am and then hit snooze a few (hundred) times before actually dragging myself out of bed at 8:35.  I have to be at work at 9.  Fortunately my office is less than a mile away, so I’m never more than 10 minutes late. (okay, so it’s typically 10 minutes late).  Perhaps it’s all of that kinda-sorta sleeping I do between 7:30 and 8:35 which screws me up.  I know that I often have really wacko dreams in that hour.  Note to self: keep track of dreams for blog. Maybe someone can tell me a bit about them…?  Its 9:24 now and I was still here before most of my co-workers, including my Executive Director.  I have decided to divulge about my “marriage.”  Otherwise I wouldn’t be fulfilling the mission statement of my blog.  Here’s a brief overview: Met my husband, CB, August 10th, 2002 at his prom-theme karaoke birthday party.  I was there to crash it with some girlfriends. CB and I saw each other, felt sparks and three weeks later we were engaged.  He dropped to his knees, I dropped to mine, he asked and I said yes.  He was charming, beautiful, intelligent, fun, exciting, and he loved and saw me like no one else ever had.  Plus he was giving me something no one had given me in a painfully long time: his heart.  So far, everything was just as I had always dreamed.  What I found later is that “dreamed” is the operative word.  Dreamland is not equal to Reality. At all. And you can’t intertwine the two.  One year and one month later on September 7th 2003, we were married in a gorgeous ceremony at my parent’s house on Cape Cod, Mass.  By this time I had seen CB’s charming and exciting façade crack and begin to crumble, but I had refused to notice.  No way was I going to let some “minor” flaws ruin my wedding.  I had done all the reading (The Conscious Bride, Getting the Love You Want, etc.) and we had gone to couples counseling AND marital counseling.  So what if sometimes when he drank too much he would become verbally abusive? It was only three times.  He’s promised to work on it and he said he would never hurt me. So what if we got so desperate for money that I went to work as a maid?  Of course he can’t get a job stocking shelves at the grocery store, because then he’d really be too tired to get out of bed the next day to look for a substantial job. So he’ll just keep his one-shift a week job.  I didn’t mind cleaning other people’s shit (literally) off their toilet seats if it meant that Chris was working on getting a better job.  And hey, when he would go out and spend money we really didn’t have on more climbing gear that has just hung in the closet ever since, he was just getting ready for what he would eventually be doing with his life once things turned around for him/us.  Right? Yech. At this point even writing about it makes me get an ill feeling in my gut.  I almost feel as though I am not even being fair to him by going on like this.  He is a good person, but he is also an irresponsible child who makes really bad decisions.  So it didn’t help when a month and a half after the wedding he was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder (same thing as Manic Depression) by his psychiatrist AND an alcoholic by his therapist. When I heard this news, my heart sank lower than the Titanic.  Who was this man I had married?  WHAT  had I married?  Part of me thinks that sounds selfish, but what I did to respond was not at all.  I worked harder, gave him more allowances, poured everything I had mentally, physically and emotionally into helping him “get better.” I could get into all of the specifics about what I did and what he did and how it was clear that our paths were not going in the same direction (ie, all of the ways he sabotaged my efforts), but I am in the process of trying to forgive him.  And that includes no longer hanging onto my score sheet of how I’ve been done wrong by him. On January 3rd, 2004 we got into our biggest fight that ended with me leaving him.  I couldn’t have told you what was said even five minutes after, but I know we both seared each other’s hearts with our words.  What caused the separation was that he broke his one promise: He hurt me.  When it was all said and done, I had bruises on my arms and a welt on my back.  I had put up with a lot of crap before, but that was it.  The line was crossed.    So that is the background for my marriage and now my divorce. I am hoping to get a lot of “dealing with it” done here.  Not ranting and raving all the time, but hopefully constructive ponderings about where I now find myself, how I got here and where to go from here.  And if in the meantime I find a way to divert myself from my sometimes slow-going job, great

      I like to visit TheOnion.com regularly and this week's edition is particularly good. They often have headlines on the right hand side of the page that are funny by themselves.  For example: "All Else Fails"  What makes me write about this? I'll tell you: I was browsing my friend's blog (http://hipteacher.typepad.com/schoolblog/) and made a comment about the aforementioned headline. I logged off and left my office to run an errand.  On my way to the bank I noticed how I was making every green light. And the moment I noticed this, I hit a red light (natch). I look to my left to see a marquis for a church (you know how some churches love to share a thought of the week on their signs) and it reads: "When All Else Fails, Ask God"  Coincidence?  Who cares?  It's just freaking cool how the Spirit just reaches right out to you sometimes even to knock the cynicism right out of you.

      Work is picking up - we have a semi-major fundraiser this Saturday and our BOD (Board of Directors) is flipping out with  last minute crap.  And that's just because they've slacked.  I know we wouldn't be here without a BOD, but a person's gotta be able to gripe now and then.  I went bowling last night with my pals, Jaime, Tim and JM.  We're actually in a league and I am actually a "sanctioned bowler."  The league's name is The Boys and Girls of Summer and my team's name is The Miller Liteweights.  Very fitting considering that no one has game unless they've had a few brewskis, in my opinion.  I sucked (as usual) in the first and third games, and peaked in the second.  Not so surprising as that is exactly when my beer high was at it's best.  It's quite a riot because most of the other teams are manned by the gay-homosexuals.  I hate how I feel that I have to explain why I may use "funny" terms about some things, including anything to do with the LGBT community, but I must:  I live and work in the heart of Atlanta's LGBT community. Most everyone I see, meet, work with (and so on) is gay.  And it suits me just fine. I have no problem with them and they have no problem with me being one of the rare straight white-bread America females that they deal with. So, if I ever write something that seems offensive, suck it up. I know full well what people can say about me and unless someone takes a hit at my personal character, then I don't give a damn.  If you want to call me stuck-up, spoiled, too-skinny, a dumb blonde, ditzy, goofy, loud...what-have-you...I don't care.  But I am not ignorant and I do not use words as weapons.  And by God, if someone is being a bitchy Queen, then that's what they are...and they damn well know it. Basically I have a PhD in Fag-Hag-ology and I work my ass off for equality for the LGBT community (because I believe whole-heartedly that people are people, period) and that gives me the right to speak freely. Ok- I am done with my disclaimer/rant thing.

      I have been emailing with my long-time friend, "smeghead" today (aka KF) He actually has a blog himself, which I will try to link to sometime soon: http://howling_fantods.blogspot.com (I am not so good with the html stuff yet) In the emails I have made some comments that I think need to be posted here, even if they are somewhat out of context:    "I love Boulder. It’s weird because Omar (remember him?) was in Boulder for a while, too.  Is it maybe the land of Katie’s Ex’s? Anyway, CB went to college at CU, but he never finished. He basically did not go to class his entire senior year and so they flunked him out.  He’s going back to supposedly finish school.  Apparently because he has since been diagnosed with the bipolar disorder, he may be able to cancel out the record of that last year due to his mental illness or something like that.  JM is the new guy. He is an old High School friend..  He contacted me about 3 months after I separated from CB.  We started hanging out and I have found a lot of comfort in him.  He’s a very simple man and it’s nice to be with someone without all of the drama and fuss.  But it is a strain to know that he is much more emotionally attached than I am, so I feel I must be gentle with his feelings all the time, which is hard because I still have some stomping around I’d like to do – you know, anger to get out of my system.   But I can voice nearly all of my feelings to JM about CB, both the good and bad, and he listens. He’s been really good for me in many ways. Very supportive and got me to go back to church, which I had been missing.  Part of me is afraid I am going to break his heart and it sucks."     AND:    "I miss CB in the same way I miss Aaron sometimes: through a very rosy and fuzzy lense with a slight stomach ache."    I felt the need to enter these thoughts because they are how I really feel right now.  I am finding it is hard to write without someone to write to, despite my years of keeping a diary. ...and so it is...

      June 1st.  Back at work (and therefore at a computer). I would really like a computer of my own so I could blog at home, but frankly I don't ever have time at home like I do at work. Spray tan update: Well, it's been interesting. It really was cool the first few days to see my face tan for the first time ever. I was daring and wore a super-short skirt for the first time that I've owned for over a year.  But I have learned there are some tricks to getting the color even all over your body. The spray stuff is pretty drippy when you come out of the sprayer thing. On me it gathered mostly around and between my breasts and on my ankles and feet. Definitely need to pat-dry those areas first next time, otherwise you walk around looking you're really dirty in those areas. And lemme tell ya, having dirty-looking feet automatically makes you look trashy.  I am sad to see that the tan is fading fastest on my legs as the days go by. The whole point was to make my legs look less like reflective tape. But 4 days later, I still have a tan-ish look over most of my body. I also learned that you can't wear the same foundation makeup, since the first few days after the tan I looked more like Lindsay Lohan than Wednesday Addams. The makeup I wore before was "Pale Ivory" and now I am not sure what color I am. On the plus side, when you're tan, you don't see blemishes or dark rings under your eyes, so there's really no need for makeup. I just threw on some mascara and some lipgloss and I looked hot!  'Nuff of that.  I am tired. And itchy. Too of my least favorite emotions. (Sifl & Olly fans will know)  I was up most of the night trying to ignore the 7 bug bites I have on my legs. I haven't even bothered turning on all of my lights in my office yet. Dimly lit space for a dimly lit brain.  I attempted yesterday to write an essay about how I think we, the American people, are in a Codependent relationship with the Bush Administration. This is based on the definition of codependency as set forth by Melody Beattie's book, "Codependent No More." It is a somewhat complex thought to try and put down on paper, especially since I haven't written an essay in years. The basic idea is this: Often codependents are people involved with someone who is and addict of some sort, and addicts are generally the best manipulators and deceivers. Melody Beattie describes in her book how the codependent will actively ignore their intuition which is telling them that they are being lied to by the addict, which makes the codependent feel crazy, and therefore even more dependent on the addict. The codependent thinks, "Clearly I am not of sound mind and this person who I love says that they are, so I am going to trust them and not my own inner voice that is screaming 'something is not right!'" I believe that the American people, especially those who are slapping "Bush '04" stickers on their gas-guzzling SUV's, are just like the codependent: desperate to believe that their leader, though full of lies and deception, has not and will not lead them astray. So they plow ahead, voluntarily blind to how Bush and his henchmen (Rummy, Rice, etc) are manipulating us into war, fear and mass-consumption. I know how this feels because I have been there. Manipulated and deceived to the point where you simply cannot believe that this person, who you love and who says they love you so dearly, is lying right to your face.  And yet I acquiesced.  As I stood there semalling the beer on his breath and listened to him tell me that he had not had anything to drink, I actively told myself that he was telling the truth and that my truth was wrong. But I pushed ahead and even stood up for him to other people, even as he was dragging me down. Gotta go get work done.

      Laura Bush bought her husband a parrot for his birthday, and toldDick Cheney, "The bird is so smart!&nbsp; George has already taught him to pronounce over 200 words!"  "That's impressive, all right," Cheney said.&nbsp; "But yourealize that he just says &nbsp;words, right?&nbsp; He doesn'tunderstand what they mean."  &nbsp; "That's okay," she replied.&nbsp; "Neither does the parrot."

      I don't really have anything specific to write today - just a bunch of random thoughts.    * I am sad that my former mother-in-law feels so negatively about me.  We were on the phone briefly the other day -I was asking for a favor to come by and get some photos of mine that I believe are with Chris' things which he is storing at her house - and her tone of voice and words, while not actively aggressive, were far from friendly. I know I shouldn't be surprised since I divorced her son and all, but it still hurts to find out that someone who you used to be so close with would now, "...be uncomfortable" to have me in her house.  I think I may have sensed feelings of betrayal and fear in her voice (is she afraid I might hurt her or destroy things?) . It makes me so unbelievably sad to think that she may not see that I am the same person she used to like and that the divorce was something I had to do, but it had nothing to do with her. It makes me sad deep in my heart that I have hurt so many people and there is nothing I can do about it. Sorry just doesn't cut it.    * I am having bad Carma. I spelled it like that on purpose. My car got broken in to night before last. Strange thing was, they took some empty cd cases and left the stereo.  huh? I guess the downstairs neighbor's noisy dog started barking and they ran away.  But they did manage to break my driver's side door and now I have to unlock it from the passenger side, climb through to unlatch the driver's door from the inside and go around the car to get in. That kind of thing looks stupid if you're driving a 1984 Ford Escort. It looks just plain ridiculous if you're doing that in a "fancy" Honda Accord. Yet another lesson from God: "Humble yourself, chicka!"    * I thought I had lost my cell phone earlier today. I just about lost my shit. It's my ONLY phone. I don't have a home phone. I don't have internet access at home. I don't have an up-to-date list of phone numbers anywhere except my cell phone. Seriously, I nearly had my shit leaving my body as a result of not knowing where my phone was. But then JM called and said it was in his car. Whew!    * I was thinking yesterday as I zoned out on some kids tv show with puppet penguins, "Who the hell are these people who operate puppets?" Think about it: do YOU know anyone who operates Bear in the Big Blue House or penguins or whatever kids think is cool these days? (Pisser: if you can answer this, I will not be amazed. But if you can tell me how the Bear in the Big Blue House has THREE people operating it *without having to simultaneously be latched onto each other with their genetalia* I will be amazed) Anyway, I bet these people lead sordid lives. They're famous, but nobody knows them. They have to be "high" all the time (take Steve from Blue's Clues...they like arrested him for possesion of coke or crack or something). It's hot in those suits, so at the very least, they must be smelly much of the time. I just wish I were inventive enough to write a screenplay based on this idea. It's SOOOO  Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation...).    * I am getting excited about going to Cape Cod next week to visit my mom and stepdad and little bro, who turns FOURTEEN years old soon. Holy Crap! I was 14 when the little bugger was born. I think of the shit I was pulling when I was that age and then I think of him and my face turns pale. I know I am getting old when I get my panties in a bunch thinking of how young he is and how he should NEVER do the things I did. EVER. Jeez, just thinking about all of the drugs and boyfriends and slightly illegal things I did... I get nervous for him. And I realize how utterly boring I am now. yech.    * I am hungry. I know I shouldn't complain because I get FREE lunch at work every day, but today it was stew. What is this? Medieval England? Last time I checked, this ain't "Oliver!" Bring on the real entrees people! I want chicken tenders and mac 'n cheese (CHEESE - NGF, I stole that not so much b/c I am in love with cheese, but rather because I am fascinated by your fascination with it...go figure) and some salad. At least they brought good homemade desserts today. So I didn't eat much lunch today and I am grumbly in my tumbly. And I still have another hour to waste before I can leave work.    * I was intending to get some actual work done today, but I don'wanna! So instead I've been surfing the web (who made that term up anyway? you can CRAWL on webs, but not surf them. WTF.). I found  urlLink Dave Barry's  weblog (don't look at me -that's what he calls it). It's pretty funny. He says he's glad the terrorists haven't been able to harness the massive power of cleavage. And I am reading about all of the DNC events (becuase bowling ALWAYS supercedes politics) and found out that a 12 year old girl exclaimed how Cheney should be put in time out because he said a "really, really baaaaaad word." How utterly precious and frighteningly true.    * I just saw that people made their way to my blog via searches for:  "lesbian furking videos" and "voice of bob goldwaith"     SWEET!  (do you think they meant to write 'furking'?  I wonder if it's a typo or if there is actually something or some act called 'furking'... But I haven't done it, so there must not be.)    * I wonder what the summer intern, who I have not hidden my obsessive blogging from, thinks of my tremendous slacking abilities? Thing is, when I work, I get some serious shit done. Then I have time to kill. Plus I was in a VERY boring Department of Human Resources meeting all freaking morning. That was enough work for one day.     * I like the word tremendous. Expect to see it much more often for while.

      Actaully, I just don't have time to blog today. Except to say that JM ROCKS.     He knows I have been wanting to start transcribing my diaries and so he got his techie friend to revamp and old laptop of his for me! It'll have all these cool things like OpenOffice, Mozilla and Firefox.  I have to pinch myself sometimes just to make sure this isn't a dream. I have NEVER had a boyfriend that was so thoughtful in my life. I cried when he told me about it.     THANK YOU, SWEETIE!!!

      My life is saturated with political issues. My work is always being affected by what politicians are doing and saying. The people I serve in my work, their lives hang on what these politicians do and say. The majority of people in my agency's programs (I work for an AIDS service organiztion) are homosexual. Half of the staff at my agency is gay. I feel deeply about the rights of gays, as they are essentially HUMAN RIGHTS. What our country is going through right now with this whole marriage amendment is a travesty. It is atrocious that the women's lib movement and the civil rights movement did not already make it clear that PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE.  Your brain is not less smart if it fits into the slightly smaller skull of a woman. You have a soul and can get into heaven if you are a black man. Did you know that is what men used to say? That women can't possibly make intelligent decisions because our brains are smaller and underdeveloped. Did you know that is what white people used to say? That black people don't have souls and so can't go to heaven and so why should they bother going to church... it is that same kind of ludicrous and ignorant thinking that has allowed America to be so foolish to say that two men, who love each other dearly, and have been in a committed relationship for 10 years cannot be legally recognized by the government as married/in union with one another.    What enrages me the most are these conservative fuckers who get up before congress and play the "what about the children?" card. What about them, motherfucker? You get up there, all high and mighty, talking about how "the children" would suffer in homes where there is not a father and a mother. That having two dads would be detrimental and cause the children to become immoral spawns of Satan. Guess what pal: MOST homes don't have a father AND a mother. If you want to make it illegal for kids not to have a mother and a father, then divorce should be illegal, too.  (yeah, I know that opens a whole can of worms, as some of us are glad our parents divorced and then there are other things to take into consideration, but I am just trying to make what I think is a valid point).     I just don't get it: haven't gone through all of this before? Didn't we already establish that there is  a separation of church and state? That no one religion or faction can enforce their beliefs upon others. And:    We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.    It says "We the people...promote the general Welfare...", NOT "We, the white, straight, male, Christian Coalition member...promote ourselves at the cost of others..."      ARRRGGHHH!!!!! I just can't even get all of my anger out on here at the injustice and hatefulness with which we are allowing our country to be governed.

      One year ago today JM's mother died of cancer. I didn't know her, but I know her son is a strong, giving, honest and loving man - a testament to her as a person and Mother. This post is in her memory and dedicated to JM.    JM, I wrote this for you, though I leave it open to your interpretation.  It's no masterpiece, but it's my own truth for you.       When there is nothing left to be said or done,      when everything you can think of has passed through your mind,    when there is nothing left but a lonely, aching feeling -      there is your heart, still beating.         your breath still enters and escapes your body    your arms will still reach out for someone who is no longer there,    your eyes will still open,   and I will be there with you.           I love you.

      I had several great conversations this weekend. One with JM, one with some women I just met. I went over to my friend Diane's house for a little get-together on Sat night and there were 2 young women there, Mel and Jess. I don't pretend to be old and wise (why would I do a thing like that?), but they were just a few years younger than I and asking many of the same questions I was asking then and some that I am still asking now. Why am I alone? Why am I with guys who I know aren't good for/to me? Why is my sex life the way it is?   Jess said she was having a hard time discussing these things openly with her friends. I was glad to be an outlet. I don't know if anything I said was actually helpful, but it was still good to get things out in the open. Sometimes just saying what's on your mind, getting it off your chest, is theraputic - you don't always need an answer, just the freedom to ask the question outloud.&nbsp; In speaking with them I noted how I have changed so much in some ways - learned so much since I was that age/level of maturity. I also noticed how some things are still the same, untouched by time. I am still battling with my separation anxiety/fear of abandonment issues even though I started addressing them over 5 years ago. I imagine I still have a long way to go with that, considering the amount of time in which the damage was being done (my entire life up until 5 years ago, kind of.)  The following m0rning I woke up amazingly early - we hadn't gotten to bed until 3:45 AM - at around 9am. I was stirred up, restless. I woke JM up and he was nice enough to listen to me ramble on for a few minutes before drifting back off to sleep. It was just enough to get me in a space where I could "take over from there" for myself. I got out a pen and paper - a sharpie marker and a legal pad to be precise - and starting scrawling. I thought about putting my complete thoughts down in my post, but now I think I may just copy it down just as I wrote it: splintered, crossed out, out of order, steam of thought.  * "Safety"/ease vs. Growth -> false sense of security * Path is narrow, difficult terrain (rocky, steep grades) ->wind up working harder at maintaining that false...in long run than if you were to face your SELF and LIFE Yes, hard, harrowing at first, but then only really truly ALIVE. Alternative is living in darkness, shame, fear, lies  Is that really living?  Like this, you cannot reach the high and see the utter beauty that one experiences.  Good person = Christian&nbsp; [NOTE: I am  not  equating that to be a good person that you must be a Christian. What I believe is that the path of the good person or of the Christian is a VERY HARD one. If you chose to be a GOOD person, you have higher standards to live up to. You have to take many more things into consideration when making choices. You cannot be selfish. And that is hard.]  Good person -> MUST include being good to yourself (does not mean buying new shoes to temporarily satiate your feelings of emptiness) -> take the time to get to know, accept and love your&nbsp;SELF in the same way (or more than) you would a new boy-/girlfriend. But b/c you already carry so much history, this will take some time & a lot of forgiving.  I still walk around & will suddenly feel the pang of hurt/shame of things that happened when I was 8 years old. Like how I lost a copper bracelett at school that had belonged to my Grandmother. She had gotten it as a child at an Indian Reservation. It KILLS me that I lost something so old &amp; surely had some sentimental meaning for my GM to have given it to my mom. I "borrowed" it from my mother's jewelry drawer and then lost it.  I have to fogive my 8 yr old SELF. I was a child. As a kid you make mistakes & then hopefully learn from them. (same thing goes for adults) But for me to carry around this guilt and not address it openly &amp; honestly with my self (and/or others if you feel that helps) just adds to the mess in my emotional closet. This is one thing I can forgive myself for and then get rid of. If even this "small" thing was still causing me such emotional stress, just think of how the "big" things must be eating away at me.  Some people spend their whole lives actively avoiding the mess that has taken over their emotional closet. Standing with their back desperately pressed against the closet door like Donald Duck trying to keep all of the junk from toppling onto him. That is HARD work. And you're fooling yourself of you think you can keep that door shut forever. Eventually things fall out, like a tennis racket bonking you on the head. Or sometimes it's the whole she-bang that you will find yourself buried under.  So what can you do? Clean out your emotional closet. It's like spring-cleaning for your soul. Dig, sort, organize, THROW AWAY. It is hard as FUCK. Especially at first. I know. And the frustrating part is that you have to do it all over again throughout your life. The first time is the hardest b/c (1) you're new at it (2) you'll have many more years of emotions to sort through. Can anyone do this? I'm not sure. I was lucky when my emotional closet first came crashing out me. That was my "Panic Summer" of 1998. My avoidance of my emotions & behaviors attached to my parents' divorce caught up with me in the form of severe panic attacks &amp; a bad case of fear of abandonment.  If you don't deal with it, it will deal with you.   I hadn't even really known I had been avoiding it all this time. My parents marriage died when I was 7. My "Panic Summer" I was 21. I was lucky that my mom let me quit my summer job, move back in with her and paid for me to go to therapy 2x week.   Sometimes I wish I had never opened that door. I think for a moment of how much easier things would be. But deep down I KNOW that's just a false sense of security. I know there's still work to be done. There always will. Really living life comes with strings attached.

      I was thinking today about how JM has been wanting to take me to IMAX & Martinis at the Fernbank Museum (yeah, yeah - I know it makes you think of SPERMbank...). It's a little shin-dig that the IMAX people put on every Friday where you can go mingle, eat appetizers, drink martinis, listen to live jazz and then watch an IMAX movie. It's like one of those "perfect date" type things because the entire evening is all laid out for you, like your mother used to do with your clothes in the morning. (actually my mother only did that when we were going somewhere fancy, other than that I won the clothes battle early on)  JM's been itching to go for some time but then something always comes up and we don't go. To be honest though, I haven't been as eager. I knew I wasn't gung-ho about it, but I never considered why until just now.     The last time I was at the Fernbank Museum was January 3rd, 2004. It was the last place Chris and I went anywhere together as a married couple (except for the bank to get our divorce papers notarized). We did not intend to go there together because I had actually asked him to "leave" the day before.  On that day (friday) I was paying bills when I found he had spent $200 at an Outdoor Outfitters store. That was $200 we DID NOT have to spend anywhere, especially on climbing gear. When he got home I was LIVID and when he was unable to explain why he had spent this money, I knew that if he did not leave that minute, I would explode and rip him apart. So I asked him to stay with his mother that night so I could have some time to cool off. The idea was that we would be able to discuss it more productively if I weren't angered to the point of becoming The HULK.    But the next day I was still pissed as hell. The problem was that we had been invited to a lesbian wedding at the Fernbank that night (saturday) and we both really wanted to go. His family was going as well. It wound up that Chris and I went together to the wedding instead of in separate cars as we had planned. We get there and immediately Chris put his arm around me like nothing happened. I pulled back and asked him what he was doing. He offered that it would probably be best to act like nothing was wrong so we wouldn't be a downer at this wedding. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea, but I couldn't think of an alternative. So we acted like the happy couple, only occasionally making snide remarks at each other under out breath through a fake smile.    Then the wedding ceremony started and it was beautiful. The sentiment was so lovely and heartfelt, it reminded me of our wedding vows, which hadn't been so long before (Sept.7th '03) and all of the hopes and dreams I had for us. I reached out for his hand and squeezed it, as if to say, "We'll get through this tough time we've been going through. We have each pther and love each other."  When the reception started I was a little high on wishful thinking and wine. We danced and it almost felt like old times, before everything (including him and me) got ugly. Then something happened and we began to fall into a fast and furious downward spiral. I think it was two things that clashed at once. 1) I had that one sip of wine that allowed me to make another snide remark and 2) despite Chris' denial to this day, I am convinced he had been sneaking off and drinking alcoholic beverages and I caught on.    Stupid from the wine, I let Chris come on home with me that night. We got home, I listened to my messages: My sister had given birth to her little girl, Samantha and my friend, Roar, had called. I called Roar back and I made another snide remark to her about Chris. He was right there in the room with me and said, "Don't say things like that." He was right that I shouldn't have made the comment, but his tone of voice was threatening, not pleading. The look on his face was one of such anger that I had only encountered before when he had been in one of his drunken rages: pure, inflamed disdain. When in his drunken rage he would change, like Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, from a sensitive man to an irrational beast. At that moment I blew off his remark though because I was feeling indignant.     It was a different story when I got off the phone. We were both on the edge, just waiting to see who would fire first. I don't remember much of what happened after that. I know we both said some evil and scornful things to each other. We were cutting as low as we could at each other. And then he shoved me into the night stand. I was in shock, but not about to back down. The fight moved into the living room where I suddenly found myself being held up against a bookcase by my neck and then, only a moment later, tossed into (INto, not onto) the sofa and being nearly strangled. (some of this is just coming back to me as I write this) I had been yelling insults and meager attempts at logic at him still the whole time. For no reason he stopped and stepped back. That's when I grabbed the hard-cover (small) suitcase and lobbed it at his head.     Papers and other crap flew out of the suitcase. By the time the papers settled all over the living room floor, Chris was on the phone with the police. "I am being attacked by my wife!" he screamed into the phone. That's when I stopped. I stopped dead in motion and thought. I was now officially in shock. The next thing I knew, Chris' Mom was inspecting the welt on my back and telling me that Chris' sisters' husband was on his way to get me.  Away from here. I stumbled around grabbing my pillow, a toothbrush and the camera.     I saw Chris several times after that, before and since the divorce, but the sight of him was always stained with fear. Especially once he realized the divorce was actually going to happen. He took on a strange and intimidating "bigger" self. He would stand close to me, actively towering over me. I was lucky if I could stand at all, his presence shook me that hard. With all that in mind, I think that's why I don't want to go to the IMAX &amp; Martinis. Sorry, JM.

        When I say to move, it means go someplace else, not switch          positions with each other so there are still two of you in the          way.  The dishes with the paw prints are yours and contain your          food. The other dishes are mine and contain my food. (Please note,          placing a paw print in the middle of my plate & food does not stake          a claim for it becoming your food &amp; dish, nor do I find that          aesthetically pleasing in the slightest.)  The stairway was not          designed by NASCAR and is not a racetrack. Beating me to the bottom is          not the object. Tripping me doesn't help because I fall faster than you          can run.  I cannot buy anything bigger than a king size bed. I am          very sorry about this. Do not think I will continue to sleep on the          couch to ensure your comfort. Look at videos of dogs and cats sleeping.          They can actually curl up in a ball. It is not necessary to sleep          perpendicular to each other stretched out to the fullest extent          possible. (I also know that sticking tails straight out and having          tongues hanging out the other end to maximize space used is nothing but          sarcasm.)  My compact discs are not miniature Frisbees.  For          the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom. If by some          miracle I beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it is not          necessary to claw, whine, meow, try to turn the knob, or get your paw          under the edge and try to pull the door open. I must exit through the          same door I entered. (In addition, I have been using the bathroom for          years, canine or feline attendance is not mandatory.)  The proper          order is kiss me, then go smell the other dogs or cats' butt. I cannot          stress this enough. It would be such a simple change for you.  To          pacify you I have posted the following message on our front door: Rules          for Non-pet owners who visit and like to complain about our pets: 1.          They live here; you don't. 2. If you don't want their hair on your          clothes, stay off the furniture. 3. I like my pet better than I like          most people. 4. To you it's an animal. To me, he and/or she is an          adopted son and/or daughter who is short, hairy, walks on all fours, and          is speech challenged.  Dogs and cats are better than kids. They          eat less, don't ask for money all the time, are easier to train, usually          come when called, never drive your car, don't hang out with drug using          friends, don't drink or smoke, don't worry about buying the latest          fashions, don't wear your clothes, don't need a gazillion dollars for          college, and if they get pregnant, you can sell the results.    Sincerely,   Your completely puppy/pussy-whipped owner

      JM forwarded me this  urlLink link  to a website that concerns itself with comapring the world's religions (the major ones at least:Hinduism, Buddism, Islam and Christianity) and contemplating the notion of whether or not all religions really are just different paths to the same place, if one religion is more "valid" than the others, and similar questions.  I like the author's introduction. It seems to take most points into account and the end of his introductory statement is great:    You are invited to study this topic further, according to your interest in it, knowing that this is neither the first nor the last attempt to discuss the complementary and divergent thought among world religions. The discussions, arguments and debates in comparative religion did not start recently and will certainly not stop until the end of the world, the time when the Truth will reveal itself in fullness.     I like the fact that this person does not in any way assume they know the answer, or that there even is just one answer. Un-assumption is good.

       I see on many other blogs that people tell you who they are in a list. So here's mine, dammit. I don't think I am going to have a specific number of things, or maybe I will. Let's find out, shall we?   1. I am a blonde. Sometimes even my hair is that color.  2. I am also smart. Not so much in the "i read that book and now I understand everything" way, but rather in a "i look around me and notice crap and then connect the dots my own damn self thank you" way.  3. Sometimes I am wrong. Except when it comes to something that has to do with JM. Then I am always right. (right sweetie?)  4. If I were a character on Friends, I'd be a mix of Phoebe and Chandler.  5. If I were a character on Sex and the City, I'd be a reformed Samantha with a touch of Carrie.  6. My boobs are small. 36A. It bothers me. This, and the fact that I have a non-descript ass.  7. Everything else on me is small, stretched over a formidable length. Especially my legs.  8. I like the fact that I have long legs, even though they look too skinny sometimes.  9. My face was somewhat kind to me in High School, ie, not many pimples. Now it is a veritable warzone.  10. I wear an aquamarine ring that makes me look stuck up because it's really big and obnoxious. But I love it because it was my Mother's. She got it from her parents when she turned 21. I got it from her when I turned 21.  11. I have a pair of small diamond earrings that I got from my father when I turned 16. I have never had them out of my ears for more than 5 hours since.  12. I have kept a diary since I was in the third grade. My early entries went like this:    Today was a C-. [I used to grade my days] School was boring. I went rollerskating on Tuesday. It was fun. Shawn looked at me two times. Math is dumb.      When I look back at my old diaries I am reminded of events and emotions I had completely forgotten about. What is strange is that I don't think I ever made any reference to my parent's divorce.  13. I am bad about starting books and never finishing them.  14. I used to love LOVE. Now I fear it. That is sad.  15. I wish I could sing. I am a soprano II. That means I can hit really high notes. But it is only good for filling out a group. I have had several boyfriends who've responded to my singing in the car by turning up the volume. It's their nice way of letting me know my voice sucks.  16. I am a good driver.  17. I have headaches all the time.  18. I sleep on my stomach with my head turned to the left.  19. I have ADD. Ask anyone who has ever engaged in a conversation with me.  20. I love music and have often had a "soundtrack" to go along with any given time in my life. Right now however there hasn't been a particular album that I relate to. I wish I could find one.  21. I have two cats: Lily and Lorca. I don't like Lorca. She is an annoying and whiney&nbsp;bitch.  22. I am very animated. It is not uncommon for someone to compare me to a cartoon character.  23. I love my parents. Flaws and all. It is a comforting and sad love.  24. I love my Stepfather. I hate my Stepmother. I have to work on forgiving her.  25. I have 4 siblings, only one of which is my "whole" sister.&nbsp;There is my&nbsp;older half-sister, and older half-brother, then me, then my sister and then my little half-brother. The first two and the last one are not related at all. But we still all call each other brother and sister. I like that.  26. My dreams are most often about trying to get somewhere, but I don't know where I am or where I'm trying to get to. I just know there is a strong sense of urgency.  27. I like books of quotes.  28. My favorite book as a child was   urlLink  Higglety Pigglety Pop -or- There Must Be More To Life     by Maurice Sendak. I also love Rootabaga Stories, The Diary of Anne Frank and A Swiftly Tilting Planet. It makes me sad that I have not been carried away by a book&nbsp;since I was a child.  29. I procrastinate.  30. Sometimes I feel like I could punch a hole through the wall. Sometimes it's because I am just that angry and other times it's because I think I actually do it.  31. I started smoking, drinking and my period&nbsp;at age 14. I started smoking pot at age 15. I had my first kiss at age 15. I lost my virginity and went to my first rave at age 17. I did ecstasy for the first time at age 20. I kissed my first girl when I was 22. I stopped doing X and going to raves at age 23 when some kid said to me,"I want to be like you when I'm OLD." I got married at age 26 and divorced by 27.&nbsp; I can't believe I am closer to 30 than to 20 now.  32. I like writing.  33. Is this list too long already?  34. I&nbsp;"did&nbsp;a number 2"&nbsp;in the bathtub when I was a little girl and then, as I sat there with my poo floating around me,&nbsp;told my mom a stray dog had done it.  35. See, it was worth reading all the way down here.  36. I have severe pollen allergies.  37. I don't wear make-up every day.  38. I wear jeans as much as I can. But I love an excuse to get really dressed up every once in a while.  39. I think I'm sexy and really dorky.  40. I love watching tv. I love watching movies in a cinema even more.  41. I return my rented videos on time more often than not.  42. I like to make up words.  43. It bothers me when people who have a terrible vocabulary pick one "smart" word and use it all the damn time.  44. I like it when people say "mash the button", "mightcould",&nbsp;"cut on the lights" or "yonder" and mean it.  45.&nbsp;I am secretly convinced that I have some weird disease that no one knows about yet.  46.&nbsp;I speak too loudly sometimes and it embarrasses people I am with.  47. I cry a lot. I have cried&nbsp;over crying too much.  48. I am lucky to have a boyfriend that believes me when I say that I am not usually such a neurotic bitch and that it's a phase I am going through.  49. I wish my Dad knew me. Really knew me, like my Mother does.  50. I am whiney and cranky when I am very tired or very hungry. To be fair, I warn people of this when I first meet them.  51. I do not miss school, but I do miss college. I miss Graduate School and I haven't even been yet. I miss being intellectually stimulated.  52. I get really worked up about politics. Mainly because I hate politics in general. I think Bush is a puppet. He's not evil, just stupid.  53. I have moved more times than I can count. If I had to guess, it'd be like 25 times.  54. I was in a different High School every year.  55. I moved to Stuttgart, Germany in 1989 when I was 12 years old because my Mother married a German. I went to German schools and had German friends. I moved back to the States when I was 17.  56. By then I had been skiing in Switzerland &&nbsp;Austria, camping in Italy and France, windsurfing in Holland, and visited Venice, Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, Strassburg and many other fantastic places. My older self is jealous of my younger self.  57. I have been to 32 of the 50 United States.  58. I drove out to California by myself. In my little Neon car with no cell phone. I am proud of that.  59. If I could have one wish, it would be to be able to have more time to relax, get away, write, think and meditate. Or enough money to buy bigger boobies (just kidding!)  60. Olivia is not my real name.

       I kind of feel like a frontiersman...on the verge of discovering something new. I am sure many peeps know this, but FireFox doesn't even really exist yet. I am using version 0.9, meaning that  version 1, the real , full-on version has yet to come.  There's something exciting about navigating through uncharted territory, but it's also really annoying because I know crap about configuring shit. (Yeah, I know a billion people have probably already posted to their Blogger blog via FireFox, but whateva, it's still cool)      I am having trouble downloading anything (macromedia flash, "blogthis!", etc.). I am supposed to be able to open the application on my desktop, but the "open file in" window isn't offering me that option. It's only allowing me to save it to a disk. It's probably some stupid "safety" option in Windows that doesn't let me download things. Ain't that a bitch.     Also I see that the pink background on my blog doesn't show up on FireFox. Huh?    I would be happy to see any suggestions...

       Yet again, Rob Breszny of FreeWill Astrology is THE man. Here is the Pisces horoscope for this week:      Joan Borysenko is a medical researcher and psychologist who has written several books on how to synergize the efforts of mind and body in cultivating good health. I respect her work, but was appalled at a statement she made recently to an interviewer. "The most sobering discovery," she said, "is that we will never truly heal the wounds of our past." My own experience suggests that some people have suffered some irremediable hurts. But on countless occasions, I've also seen brave, dedicated souls completely fix what had been broken in them. In fact, that precise possibility is now looming for you, Pisces. In the coming weeks, you will have the power to make dramatic progress toward a spectacular cure that will put you in better shape than you were before you were wounded.

       Tuff Muff is the name of a Muffler shop in Fort Wayne, IN. It is now also the name of me, as designated by me. Woo-how! I also must share what my boss said the other day. First you should know that she is from England, so she "talks funny." My fave thing about it is not so much her accent, but the actual phrases she uses. Recently she said of our Board President, who&nbsp;is quite the micro-managing ninny, this: "He's been a naughty boy. He deserves a spank-bottom and sent to bed with no milk and cookies!" So that's what I say all the time now. It's good stuff. I never thought of getting spanked as a noun before. (or would that be some other kind of verb or something? gosh, I'm grammar stupid.)   Last night was my first session with my new group. This one is not a divorce support group, but rather a general therapy group. In a strange way it's kind of like what we are to each other on our blogs, only in person. Obviously I can't&nbsp;write about anything that was said in there, but I can say it was intriguing. Some people have been in that group for 7+ years. The "newest" member has been there for 2 years. I am also the youngest by far. I think the next oldest person is 38. But everyone was extremely welcoming to me. I was a little discouraged by the middle of the session, but things turned around by the end and some good thoughts were shared that really did bring the one person's issue into perspective. 'kay, enough of this vague bs.   I just realized the other day that it is possible that Chris has a bunch of my photos - not pics of me - but my own personal photos, like ones from even before he and I met. It is my guess that the box they were in is at his Mom's house, but I have no idea how to approach this. I guess it'll only be a big deal if I make it a big deal.    THE SUN     urlLink  The&nbsp;Sun    is a magazine I've just recently subscribed to. It's pretty kickass. Actually it's really the shit. In the back of the magazine was a story by the editor, Sy Safransky, about his daughter,Mara, being a in horrible car accident. There were two things in there that really touched me:       My daughter is suffering. The woman across the hall is suffering. Is the suffering in 704 more important than the suffering in 705? Of course not. What would it mean, I wonder, to let everyone's suffering be as important to me as Mara's suffering, to love everyone as much as I love my daughter? Impossible, my mind insists: my heart would be breaking all the time. That's why I often turn away from other people's pain or try to put it in perspective by suggesting (if only to myself) that it's "God's will" or someone's "karma." Yet my heart knows the deeper truth, which is that  there's no way to feel kinship with other living beings unless I let their suffering in .      AND        There are only two or three human stories, Willa Cather once wrote, which go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before.      I love the truth of the first thought. It is dismal and beautiful and honest. I love the knowledge of the second thought. And I LOVE the use of the word  fiercely  to describe how life goes on and on the way it does. I revel in the idea of the energy that is used for life/existence as being fierce. Babies are born fiercely. Your body is still fiercely burning calories even as you die. A constant push and pull that takes place between everything and everything else. Creation, destruction, survival, even the electricity that is running through my brain at this very moment to allow me to string these words together.&nbsp; My banging on the keyboard that makes&nbsp;my desk&nbsp;shake slightly. The truck that rumbles down the street. It's odd that all of this doesn't make for a bumpy ride on our planet.   I'm really tired.   PS: Why does blogger's spell check not recognize "blogs" as a word? That's kinda dumb.

      Um, so can ANYONE explain to me why I am seeing so many "Bush '04" bumperstickers? Please, just give me ONE good reason this wackjob should stay...  &nbsp;  First, check out this  urlLink film  because it is HIL-fucking-ARIOUS.  &nbsp;  Then read this:    Bush gave a big speech last week about how his faith is so "important" to him. In this attempt to convince the American people that we should consider him for president, he announced that his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3. Of course the speech writer meant John 3:16, but nobody in the Bush camp was familiar enough with scripture to catch the error. And do you know what John 16:3 says? John 16:3 says; "And they will do this because they have not known the Father nor Me".    Huh. I guess I don't have to tell you who is gonna burn in hell. BTW, I should share that I think hell is whatever a person would deem the worst possible scenario to spend eternity in. For example, my hell consists of being in a port-a-john in which AC/DC is played constantly. FOR EVER.  I wonder what W's hell would be?

      Wow! Blogger has a new format for their post window.  Now I can change fonts all over the damn place!  I missed you all soooo much   and I am grateful for the comments you left so my little blog    didn't feel so all alone.   &nbsp;   My visit to Indy was pretty interesting.&nbsp; Fort Wayne was, well, um, a place to visit. JM's family was very welcoming and friendly and I had a fine time. I can't say it was great because family reunions are always somewhat stressful and even more so when you aren't even&nbsp;a part of the family. Because you don't know who to avoid. There is nothing worse than being cornered by crazy Aunt Tabby, who isn't even an Aunt, she's just some lady that somehow attached herself to the family and every one else has learned to avoid her.   &nbsp;  Luckily there wasn't really anyone like that, except one guy I saw from afar who had a weird swagger and was clearly stuck in the 80's. Looking at him I had to wonder if maybe he even came out of the womb with tight-rolled jeans and a feathered haircut, even though that would have been sometime in the late 60's. And JM's Grandma, Nonnie, liked to share stories. A LOT. It was really very endearing, but there should be a time limit to how long you, as a complete stranger&nbsp;who is trying to be polite,&nbsp;have to stand there listening to a Grandma and her daughter tell each other what the correct version of the story is. I really can't say anything&nbsp;though because I know my family is probably worse.&nbsp; That's why we call it the Fam-damn-ily in a loving yet honest tone.  &nbsp;  We also&nbsp;had a great visit with my older (half-) sister, Alexis and her husband Bob and their CUUUTE son, Ian. One thing that kicked ass was how much my sis liked JM. She's kick-ass and totally cool, so I was thrilled when she said he was her fave guy I ever dated "because he's the most normal." Which is weird coming from her because she's the&nbsp;other weirdo&nbsp;in the family (me being the other other weirdo).&nbsp;&nbsp; The not-so-kick-ass thing was how my ovaries were SCREAMING at me to have babies. And something else that's weird is how I feel like I have been inundated lately with Baby and Family propaganda. Not from people, but from everywhere. The TV, the people we sit next to at the IHOP, the free subscription offer for magazines like "Child" or "Family Living", etc. Luckily Aunt Flo was in town and so there was no chance&nbsp;for my insane self to go and do something stupid like steal JM's spermies in the middle of the drunken night to "maka-de-bebbies."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The trip itself it was fun. JM is a great fellow-road-tripper because neither of us get worked up about getting to specific places at certain times. When we don't have a time constraint, we'll just bum around to see what we can see. On the way up there we found ourselves to be "creatively misplaced" (aka: on the wrong highway) and in the middle of corn fields. There was a corner store called "Eat Here and Get Gas." We liked that. I will have to figure out how to upload photos, dammit. And then at another juncture of creative misplacement, JM responded to&nbsp; my decision not to give him a hard time for getting lost - again - and sheepishly apologized, "I'm sooooorry; butthole." I know it reads mean, but it was furking hilarious. We also stopped off at "Rock City" and went to a good ribs restaurant (instead of grabbing more fast food), eventhough it set us back 2 hours for our return home.  &nbsp;  JM and I&nbsp;totally bonded on this trip and that was awesome. It also freaked me the fuck out. I find I have become a total commitment-phobe. Every time I try to open my heart up a little more to him, I panic. All in good time, my child. All in good time. Of course it didn't help much when on the trip home last night JM took the exit for Ringgold, GA. This is the closest&nbsp;you can get to a Vegas Wedding in Georgia. It's not open 24hrs, but you can get married, start to finish,&nbsp;in less than an hour for like $50. I was pretty sure the courthouse would be closed since it was 10:30pm, so I challenged him, "If you do it, I will."&nbsp; It was insane.&nbsp;We joked this morning about being an "almost wife" and an "almost husband" to each other. Then I took some more Xanax.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And now for something completely different: I realized that I really don't miss Chris. At all. I am just unbearably sad and angry about what happened. It kind of freaks me out that I don't miss him. How does that work? I mean, there I was, spending the  rest of my life with him  and now I don't even miss him? Is that normal? Maybe it just has something with&nbsp;not being able to think of him at all without deep resentment kicking in...  &nbsp;  Okay. And now for some words that I say that don't make sense:  Mow Lawner  Pooth Tick  Taper Powel  Chicky with my Pili  Broke Stocker  Fresh of breath air&nbsp;

      I am going to Indy for a few days and so I probably won't be able to blog until next Tuesday, July 20th. I'll be taking notes of all of the wacky things that happen way up in the Midwest. (why is it called that, anyway? I know, I know - it was called that when they thought Colorado was the West Coast or whatever, but why didn't the name change? Now we call Colorado the West and California the West Coast. But the same area in the East is just "The East Coast" or "The North." Whatever.)  I would also like to take this time to point out that I have almost had 2,000 hits on my blog. I know some of y'all passed that number long ago, but I am kinda proud. So I say, "Thascool."  In the time that I am gone, go crazy with the comments so my little blog doesn't feel so all alone and neglected. and please don't forget about me...!

      I have seen or met the following famous people: (note: this list will NOT impress people who live in LA)  1) Bobcat Goldwaith - at a grocery store parking lot in LA. He was driving a cherry red classic convertible.  2) Marilyn Manson - twice in one night: 1 at the Bennihanna on Sunset Blvd. He was there with Rose and some other creepily normal looking guy. 2 Later that night at the Hollywood Bowling Lanes. Encouraged by the alcohol in our brains, we decided it was a good idea to let him know that we knew he was following us. He was non-plussed.  3) Arnold Schwarzenegger - he was at that little shoe store in Santa Monica. He was the first famous person I saw in LA that summer of 1999. I thought about speaking German to him, but then remembered that even though Austrians speak German, their dialect skews it so much I can't understand a damn word.   4) Ben Affleck - I never thought much of him until I met him in person. Dude, this guy could charm the pants off the Dalai Lama. This was after Gwen and long before J.Lo, so he still had some cred then. I have his autograph just under where I wrote "Holy Crap! It's Ben Affleck!" on a piece of paper.  5) John Goodman - this was in a completely out of the way crawfish restaurent in New Orleans. He saw that we were gawking and came right over to our table to say hello. Cool as hell.  6) James Hatfield from Metallica - This was YEARS ago when I still lived in Germany. He was going down the escalator and I was going up. Our eyes met and his look begged me not to make a scene. So I didn't. Generally I don't hound famous people when I see them - who the hell am I to bug them while they're just trying to rent a fucking video?  7) Heath Ledger - at the 20/20 Video place on Ventura. This was not long after "10 Things I Hate About You" came out and just before "The Patriot" came out. I couldn't place him at first, even though I had already developed one of my huge yet RARE moviestar crushes on him. He was there with a guy friend and what seemed to be a soon-to-be-exgirlfriend. She was being a whiney bitch and he kept looking at me. His guy friend kept hitting on me, but I SWEAR Heath and I were fixed on each other. I still wonder to this day what would have happened if...  8) John Kerry - my uncle is a bigshot lawyer in Atlanta and a bleeding heart, card carrying democrat. My Aunt arranged a Kerry fundraiser at their house for my Uncle's 50th birthday. Kerry was there. He's much warmer in person. One cool thing my former husband did at this meeting: he quoted Voltaire to Kerry, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." Kerry was pleased to be remided of this great quote. Patriot Act anyone?  9) Whitney Houston & Bobby Brown - this was quite recent. It was at a Japanese grill in a suburb of Atlanta. JM and I got there just before closing time. Then a whole group of people came in and sat at the table in the back. We kept hearing a teenage girl cry and this woman hollering about how life is hard and you just gotta cry and then you gotta take it. It was like a small sermon/testimony. We turned and saw that we were listening to Whitney "tell it like it is." She was weird. And sweaty. She looked cracked out. Bobby was sitting in the bar area, looking sad. I am pretty sure he was on his way back to jail the next day.  10) The chick from "Family Ties", the fat girl from any show on Nickelodeon, Wayne Brady - these people go in a group together because no one really gives a shit about them.  11) Johnathan Kwan - you know, the little Asian guy from Indiana Jones and The Goonies! The same night I saw Marilyn Manson, the group of A/V nerds I was hanging out with included John. We tried all damn night to get him to say "Fitty Dolla Beal" and "That's what I said. Booby trap!" He's like 32 now.  12) Ice Cube - He was one of several people I met while I was doing movie promotions. I had to find out where all of the KFC and Church's Chicken places were in proximity to the Ritz Carlton where he was staying.  13) Mike Epps - he was there with Ice. He seriously needs some Ritalin.  14) Chris Tucker - He is funny as hell. But he does have an entourage that includes his Pastor and an Intern. What the hell does an actor need an intern for? And what on earth could the intern be possibly learning? All I know is I had to track down an extra limo for this brat to go shopping at the mall. That was ACORSS THE STREET from the hotel. WTF.  15) Peter Bogdanovich - He was singing to/wooing me within half an hour of picking him up at the airport. I knew I could have been his next "it girl" if only my work partner hadn't kept an eye on me so much. He really does wear neckercheifs and big round glasses all the time.  16) Edward Burns - HOT. Hotter than fire. need i say more?  17) Wesley Snipes - He was way too self-imporant for someone who had been in so many bad movies.   18) Tara Reid - this is one I would gladly trade. She is a cheap floozy. And annoying.  19) LL Cool J - MMMMMMMMELT. (sorry JM, but its true.)  20) Parker Posey - well, not really. Someone else in my company did her press tour. But I do have her autograph. It reads, "Hey Olivia, Parker Posey." How wonderfully dis-interested of her! Very appropriate.  21) Me.  There's more, I'm sure. I just can't think anymore and lunch is awaiting me...

      I am bored out of my mind. It's 5:12pm and I can't leave work until my boss gets back from a meeting. I have been stuffing envelopes all damn day. My head is about to burst all over my monitor because some jackwad at my work decided to burn incense and now I have a migraine. Doesn't everyone know incense is really bad for you to inhale? It's basically like eating one of those scented trees you hang in your smelly van, all full of chemicals and God-knows-what-else. AND INCENSE DOESN'T EVEN SMELL GOOD!  sorry.  I am also a little excited about going home. Why? Because I have a rental car (since mine is in the body shop for the next week) and it's a Trailblazer (I almost wrote Trailbalzer. he,he.). I have never owned an SUV and generally I despise the gas guzzling tanks, but they told this one was good on gas (WHATEVER! 30 mpg/Hwy is NOT good), but hey, it's not Satan's Ride (aka that obnoxious monster fuck the H2). Long story short: it's kinda cool being up so high and seeing so much more around me. I come from a long line of low cars: 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (it was GOLD colored - I was straight pimpin' y'all), a Toyota Corolla, a Plymouth (not the fancy Dodge) Neon, and now I have a 1996 Honda Accord. My Honda is pretty nice - leather seats, sun roof, cd player - I would LOVE the new Accord.  But anyway, as you can tell by now I am just rambling because otherwise I would be crying from boredom.  BLAH.

      HRC, the nation's largest GLBT civil rights organization just emailed me this:    WE DID IT! Just moments ago, the Federal Marriage Amendment lost in the Senate by a stunning, bipartisan vote of 50-48. We won this historic victory for two reasons: First, because the politics of division don't work, and second: the votes were on our side.   You can find out more at  urlLink HRC.org

      I am generally not a very fearful person. I worry A LOT, but I am not so much afraid of things. I do risky things and trust people I shouldn't without much thought. Sometimes I am afraid of dying, but other times I'm not. I am not afraid to fly and I love roller-coasters.  But I do fear one very specific person, my Grandmother on my Mother's side. I was named after her, but other than that, we share absolutely no similarities. This woman is calculated and moral in everything she does. She's not a bible-beater, but she will bring God into it if it comes to down to it. Mostly its simply a matter of her being right and no one else is allowed an opinion (maybe I am a little like her...?). The main thing is she is very indimidating and overbearing. She frowns at Christmas.  Before my parent's divorce and before I got all of my additional step-grandparents, there were only three grandparental figures: my Grandma F, Gandpa F and my Granny. Granny was my dad's mom and she was the best. She let the kids run around the house still wet in our bathing suits from her pool. When we broke things she'd just say, "Oh, well. It was old anyway." Yeah, it was old - they were friggin' antiques! But she didn't care. She'd just give us another freezer-pop and let us run along. But in Grandma and Grandpa's house, there was no running. I think the place could have been on fire and my Grandma would say, "What's the big fuss? Stop yelling."  One of the most frightening experiences I had with Grandma F came to mind recently. I was even upset from remembering it at all - I had blocked it out of my memory for some time. When I was about 10 years old I found myself on my Grandparent's screened-in porch, somehow cornered by my Grandma and her ill-placed rant about what a bad person my Mother was. It was the strangest thing, even then. At first I was in shock merely because this woman who rarely ever said more than, "Tell your Grandpa dinner's ready" to me, was now going off. At me. She TOLD me, as though she was doing me a favor by informing me, that clearly my Mother was not a good person or wife because otherwise my Father never would have left her for my now Step-bitch (er, step-mother...that's a whole other story).  I think I tried to defend my Mom, but it was futile. I was like an ant trying to reason with Godzilla. She went on to say that my Mother was even worse for taking my sister and I away from our Father by marrying my Stepfather and moving us to Germany. Granted, I didn't want to be that far away from my Dad, either, but the Step-thing he married made it clear that we could not live with them. So there I was listening to this diatribe from my Grandma about my Mother, her own daughter, when I decided that my Grandma's heart must be as cold as ice. I know that "chat" on the porch scarred me in ways I couldn't understand then, but I am beginning to understand now.  I am going up to Indy this weekend for JM's Grandmother's 80th birthday/family reunion and am now confronted with the decision whether or not to visit my Grandma and Grandpa (my sweet Granny passed away last year). I feel like I should see them - Grandma's health is poor and I don't make it up to Indy often. BUT they don't know about MY divorce. And I am scared witless of what she might say to me - how I failed as a wife. If I go I have to tell her about it. I have to tell her anyway because it's not fair to expect my entire family to keep skirting the issue with her.   And while I do stand confident that I made the right decision to divorce Chris, I am in a fragile place emotionally and her words could just break me. Last night I put all of this together while I was on the phone with my Mother, crying. But if I don't see her, I can just send her a letter and that way she can't touch me.  Right now I don't think I can go see her. I should since she isn't feeling well, but I just can't face her and risk possibly being attacked how she attacked my Mom all those years ago.

      NOTE: I took the music off. It was bugging me too much.  Okay, so I found this  urlLink link  thanks to  urlLink Raineydays  to a site that gives you code for songs to play on your blog. It's a bit corny, but when I saw they offered the "It's My Life" song by No Doubt, I had to get it. It was released when I first separated from Chris and since it was utterly overplayed, I had a good and constant reminder of why I left him. Here are the lyrics:   It's funny how I find myself  In love with you   If I could buy my reasoning  I'd pay to lose  One half won't do   I've asked myself  How much do you  Commit yourself?   It's my life  Don't you forget  It's my life  It never ends (It never ends...)   Funny how I blind myself  I never knew  If I was sometimes played upon  Afraid to lose   Oh, I'd tell myself  What good do you do  Convince myself   Oh, It's my life  Don't you forget  Oh, It's my life  It never ends (It never ends...)   And I've asked myself  How much do you  Commit yourself?   Oh, It's my life... (oh its my life)  Don't you forget... (don't you forget)  Caught in the crowd... (caught in the crowd)  It never ends (it never ends...)      It was the question, "How much do you commit yourself?" that did it. Chris is mad/sad that he doesn't have a wife any more. I am mad/sad that I never had a husband.   Plus, Gwen freaking rocks my face. I love her style (all of the variations, except her own fashion line, LAMB, which is sad). My other fave song of theirs is "Simple Life" on the Return of Saturn album. Mmmmm. That's one to think on.

      I was thinking of writing about one of my most embarassing moments, but nixed the idea. I am not sure it is something people should know about.  So instead I write to you about my wacky family. I do not have a family tree, instead I call it my family kudzu. It all starts with my parents' families. Each of them have 3 same-sex siblings. 4 girls on my mother's side (In order, Nancy, Susan, Marilyn and Christine) and 4 boys on my father's side (John, Tom, Charles and Dick). Both of them were the third child in the line-up. No, I don't think the names could have been more classic American 1950's, except Christine, who was born much later. Both families grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana and ALL EIGHT of these kids went to the same High School (Broad Ripple HS). In theory, they all could have dated each other and then it would have been like the Brady Bunch on CRACK.  But they didn't and so it wasn't. My dad and mom knew of each other in HS, but didn't socialize in the same groups. My mom says my dad was a wild ....HOLY CRAP!!!! I just realzized that I AM FOLLOWING IN MY MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS IN THE MOST CREEPY WAY:  * My mother was married for less than a year before she and my dad got together. I was just married for less than a year before JM and I got together.  * My mom KNEW my dad in High School but wasn't close to him and didn't keep in touch. I knew JM in High School and though we hung out (maybe twice in the most platonic way), we weren't close and did not keep in touch.  Now, I can see why this doesn't seem too weird to some people. But those who know me and my mom will probably be just as freaked out as I am. See, my mom and I are born one day (and several years) apart. I am March 4th and she is March 5th. Her sisters (my Aunts, natch) have ALWAYS told me at every stage in my life how much I remind them of my mom. My friends all tell me that they completely understand certain quirks about me once they meet my mom.   whoa.

      Rob's Freewill Astrology for this week:    Here's one of the few universal truths I know: Everyone has a piece of the truth, even those you disagree with. According to my reading of the astrological omens, though, you are now in possession of a giant piece of the truth -- bigger than what you usually have and bigger than everyone else's piece. That's exactly why you should proceed cautiously. Your deep understanding and authoritative knowledge might tempt you to dismiss the tiny slivers of truth that other people are holding, and that would be a mistake.     In the sad event that you are not a Fishy, you can look up your sign at  urlLink FreeWill Astrology.com

      Everyday I get a "Gift" from Hazelden Online. This was Saturday's:    Today's thought is:  Moving Forward  Much as we would like, we cannot bring everyone with us on this journey called recovery. We are not being disloyal by allowing ourselves to move forward. We don't have to wait for those we love to decide to change as well.  Sometimes we need to give ourselves permission to grow, even though the people we love are not ready to change. We may even need to leave people behind in their dysfunction or suffering because we cannot recover for them. We don't need to suffer with them.  It doesn't help.  It doesn't help for us to stay stuck just because someone we love is stuck. The potential for helping others is far greater when we detach, work on ourselves, and stop trying to force others to change with us.  Changing ourselves, allowing ourselves to grow while others seek their own path, is how we have the most beneficial impact on people we love. We're accountable for ourselves. They're accountable for themselves. We let them go, and let ourselves grow.  Today, I will affirm that it is my right to grow and change, even though someone I love may not be growing and changing alongside me.   This came from "The Language of Letting Go" by Melody Beattie  I can not even begin to express how free this makes me feel. I have been walking around still feeling responsible for Chris, eventhough much of the reason for divorcing him was to free myself from his turbulent and unwell behaviors; to allow myself to heal and take care of my own wounds and issues. Why would/should I continue to carry his burden now that he is no longer in my life?  Getting this message is particularly important today in light of something that happened Saturday night. JM and I were out to dinner at a great restaurant, Murphy's, enjoying a wonderful meal (I had the Sole and he had the Filet) and savoring the last glass of wine when that song by Gerry Rafferty came on, "Right Down the Line." (see earlier post for significance) I recognized it right away and froze. I felt I had to make a decision about how I was going to react to the song.  JM saw the bewildered look on my face and asked what was wrong. By now the lyrics had begun and I was struggling to maintain composure. I didn't want to ruin the lovely evening with JM by becoming over-emotional. But right after I explained the situation to him and said that I could handle it, tears started gathering in my eyes and I had to leave the restaurant to escape the song. As I left the table JM gave me an understanding look for which I was/am grateful.  Once outside (Thank GOD they didn't have speakers out there) I tried to regain composure and not to freak out the valet guys, but I think I was mostly in shock from how powerfully I was affected. I do think the fact that I'd had a couple glasses of wine contributed to my emotion, but also that I felt that the song (and somehow therefore Chris) had intruded into my special time with JM. When JM joined me outside, he just opened his arms to hold me and I fell in his embrace; now sobbing.  JM continued to comfort me and we made our way home where I proceeded to get out my photo box. The one with all of the photos from the last two years with Chris. JM was patient as I stumbled through date pics, wedding pics and what-not. I looked up and saw a sad look on his face and I realized what I was doing - so I started stuffing the photos back into the box. He stopped me and asked me to look at one of my engagement photos. I am standing with Chris, my hand on his chest (very traditional except for the mohawk in Chris' hair and my platinum feathered 'do) and I have the biggest smile plastered across my face.  JM gently pointed out that he's never seen me that happy. I soberly replied, "I know. That photo is the embodiment of all of the hopes and dreams that I had for Chris and me. I don't have those hopes and dreams anymore. They've died. I'm sorry." JM lightly sobbed as he replied, "I know. I'm sorry, too."

      One of my all-time favorite movies is Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (1987) it is the story on which the American "City of Angels" was based (and poorly executed, I might add). The original film is a love letter to love itself, beautiful in its raw depiction of life, death and new life, as well as a look at a world beyond the one we can see but can still feel if we try. During shots of children playing and of magnificent sky-views of Berlin, a poem written by Peter Handke is recited in German. Normally an unpleasant language to listen to, this reading is soothing and even a little musical as it strokes the soul. Here is the  urlLink translation . I highly recommend this film to anyone who identifies with any of the following descriptions: -In love with the Old -Dreamer -Photographer -Believes in Angels -Doesn't believe in Angels -In love with love -Like Peter Falk (Colombo) -Liked the film "Waking Life" -Feels the undercurrents of Existence

      * I have felt so overwhelmed lately. When will I be just "whelmed"?  * JM found an ad in the Piedmont Review (ATL's alterna-wannabe yuppie paper) for a lingerie boutique in Buckhead, Oh! Fine Lingerie. They offer private appointments and custom fittings. I also love how the ad lists this: Proprietor- Sandy Thigpen.  Here's where it gets weird: In fine cursive at the bottom is their motto: "Wear it for him before he buys it for her" I don't think I need to extrapolate on how wrong that is. At the very least it has made for some fun word plays on it...   * I have begun to think that Blogland is an actual place. Think about it: blogging is not just something we do; it's a place we go. Somehow it's in my head AND out there in space. It's like we're all crawling into our collective heads and rummaging around like at a garage sale or your granny's attic. There's some cool stuff in there, even if don't always know what it's for and what you're going to do with it. There's also a lot of junk that means something to somebody, or at least did at one time. Overall it's basically mental exhibitionism and voyeurism and we're all taking part. I wonder if there are people out there who only read blogs, but never write one of their own. Me personally, I am too full of myself to not insist that everyone know what I think. So, if you're new (or not) Welcome to Blogland!  * And finally, I went to my "assessment" interview for a therapy group yesterday. I almost didn't go because the woman had been weird to me on the phone. Once I saw her in person though I realized that she is just one of these people that does not get along with modern contraptions. There was no computer in her office (though there rarely are in therapists offices) and all of the paper work was copies of once typed sheets. And by typed I mean with a type-writer. You know, those noisy things we now call antiques that actually press each letter into the page. (Side Note: do you ever think about how the things we now think of as so very modern will someday be regarded as old-fashioned? Think of how we look at things that aren't even that old, like cereal boxes from the 60's, with such astonishment with how much things have changed. Or even the early internet transmissions - they look downright medieval now. I was thinking recently about the turtle program that I used in the 2nd grade - with the black screen and neon green type that practically burned your eyeballs and how you had to tell it how to do what you wanted? We are the generation that ushered in the personal computer! It's comparable to the printing press, the automobile and the man landing on the moon!) Anyway, back to the therapist: She was much warmer in person and I was already turned around towards liking her when I saw in the waiting room two posters that read:    He who is not busy  being born  is busy dying.   AND   No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself -Rabbi Sofer 19th Century    I guess that's all for now. I could write more, but I'd be officially rambling.

      My pal,  urlLink roar(notlion) , wrote about her friend, Alison recently and it made me think about how much I have been thinking about a couple of my old friends that I have lost touch with.  In my early years I didn't have the best luck with friends. It is sad, but I can honestly say that until I went to college, I never really felt I had a real friend of my own, much less a best friend. I always got along with boys better, but I couldn't exactly invite them to my birthday parties or have them over for a slumber party. Come to think of it, I am not even sure if that was because it wasn't allowed or because it just never crossed my mind to ask to have a boy over to play.  Boys were easier to understand and if there was a misunderstanding, they'd just hit you or spit on you and that was how you knew there was a problem. But with girls I was at a loss. When a girl was mad at you, they'd tell everyone BUT you about it. It was like they spoke a foreign language and I could only understand bits and pieces. Even the bubble-like handwriting with a heart to dot every i baffled me. I tried so hard to communicate with them and be involved in whatever they were going on about, but it was all just acting on my part. If they laughed, I laughed. If they whispered, I tried to whisper and so on. For the most part I just tried to look like I was a part of the group.   The truth was, I had no freaking clue what was going on.  So it didn't help that my one friend, Meredith, wound up becoming the most popular girl in school the same year I became the most socially inept. We had been "best friends" our 2nd grade year, but when we started 3rd grade, just like that, she wasn't my friend anymore. She would still invite me to her house to sleep over sometimes and to her birthday parties, but I am sure her mother was behind that because she felt sorry for me. It was with that I became the weirdo in school, cast off to fend for myself in the harsh world of Hunter Elementary school.  It is now years later and I still wonder what happened between Meredith and me. We stayed in touch in a very loose way up through college. The contact was mostly from my end and I think it was my attempt to find out what happened, fix it and get my only friend back. I tried contacting her again when I got married thinking that perhaps now we'd reconnect as adults. Her mother sent a fancy wedding gift from their whole family, but Meredith only replied with an email saying she was too busy to write. I feel like there is a sense of disdain coming from her, like she'd like to be rid of me once and for all. But why? What did I do? I know I was (am) awkward and too hyper most of the time, but sometimes I feel like I actually did something to her. The hurt of losing my only childhood friend still scrapes my heart.   What's worse is my little sister was miss popular in her own right. I cannot describe the sting I felt when I realized the difference between her birthday party and mine. She had to limit her invite list to 20 girls. I only had one girl, who I didn't even like, but she was the only one who came. As time went on and we got older, my friends were only "mine" by default. They were actually my sister's pals and I just tagged along. Looking back I guess they were my friends, too. I think I created a reality in which I assumed I was unworthy of having friends. You can't lose a friend if you never had one. I didn't even know what a friend was and so I didn't see what was right in front of my face.  My work of not having friends was made easy in high school. I was in a different school every year (2 schools in Germany, 1 in Indianapolis and 1 in Atlanta). I excused my lack-of-friendness on the fact that I knew I would be leaving anyway, so why try? I got in with a group by being someone's girlfriend and I pretty sure that was how most people knew me. Not by my name, but as "Matt's Girlfriend." I made up for my lack of girl friends in my excess of boyfriends. Eventually I realized this had to change. I knew I was missing out on something and so I chose to go to a Women's college to force myself to have some female bonding. It worked even though I still didn't know what the heck I was doing.  I am still learning what it means to be and have a friend. I am horrible at reaching out to other people and making plans. Perhaps there's still that fear that no one will come to my party. I am lucky because now I have friends who love organizing get-togethers and so I just have to show up. But I still have to actively convince myself that they are my friends because I still don't believe I am good enough to deserve one. I don't say this to pity myself (or for anyone else to pity me). It's just my strange (?) reality.

      There is a story about this past weekend that I did not want to put into my "Hey Lady" post. But it is very important to me.  On the night of July 4th after my car got hit JM was very angry and it took him a while to regain composure. He didn't scream or yell or beat on things; he was just very quiet. I could tell he was steaming. He expressed concern about how it may have been his fault eventhough it wasn't at all. When we returned to the room we were both silent for bit while we calmed down from the shock of the accident. It was quite a downer to be involved in such negative activity when we'd had such a lovely evening, you know.  At one point I saw JM walk towards the little fridge and I had to have a mental conversation with myself that went something like this:   Red Flag! He's probably going to get a beer... Ek! But wait, before you get all worked up, remember that he is not Chris and he does not have a problem with alcohol. It's normal for a person to want to chill out with a beer. I still wish he wouldn't do it though. It makes me uncomfortable and a little afraid. But I have to remember that I can't control him and I have no reason to fear his having a beer. Don't freak out. Don't say anything. I have to not let myself get all bent out of shape over other people's choices. He has shown how he can be responsible and I should allow myself to trust that...   And with that I turned away and sat on the bed. When I looked up to see him enter the bedroom my eyes flashed with happiness: he was carrying a bottle of WATER! I started crying and hugging him and telling him how happy I was that even in this stressful moment we'd had with the car accident, independent of any outside influence, he'd opted for WATER instead of a beer.   I literally dropped to my knees in thanks to him. I think JM was a bit thrown off by this, but overall understanding of my appreciation. I know that to many people that my relief and happiness at JM's decision won't make any damn sense. But those of us who love an alcoholic, it makes all the sense in the world. See, one of my first tips that Chris had a problem was that he'd go get a drink any time there was stress. Some times he'd be upfront about it, most of the time he wasn't. I found beer caps that he knew nothing about, half-empty vodka bottles ("maybe it came that way?"), etc all at times that were even just somewhat stressful. And then it got to be that our life was always stressful and so him having a drink became a possibility at any time.   Don't get me wrong: It's not like I hate alcohol. I like it and I drink it. And hey, everyone likes to take a vacation from reality with it sometimes. But once you've been in a relationship with someone who has greater loyalty to the drink than to you, it changes your perception of it. I am just thanking my lucky stars that JM does not have a problem with it.

      A bunch of people are posting their cards and I will too, dernit.    You are the Sun card. The light of the Sun reveals all. The Sun is joyful and bright, without fear or reservation. The childish nature of the Sun allows you to play and feel free. Exploration can truly take place in the light of day when nothing is hidden. The Sun's rays fill you with energy so that you may live life to its fullest, milking pleasure out of each day. Such joy and energy can bring wealth and physical pleasure. To shine in the light of day is to have confidence, to soak up its rays is to feel the freedom of a child.

      Hey, lady! Please explain why on God's earth were you wearing a T-shirt that had BOTH the word "Atlanta" AND a row of cheesy-ass drawings of Lighthouses on it?! WTF, dude. There ain't no water 'round here, behotch.   Okay - there's lots to write. JM took me to the lovely city of Charleston, S.C. for the 4th weekend. The weather was great, the hotel was great (JM got us a room with a Jacuzzi for the last night there...RAWR!) and the food was great. We got in late Friday night but we headed right past the hotel to the beach. Jon was insistent that the only was to start the vaca right was to dip our feet in the ocean. Aside from my cranky whining because I was friggin' tired, it was really romantic.  Saturday was spent wandering around downtown 'Chas' and then we went to Folly Beach to work on our tans. Let me rephrase that: JM got tan and I stayed generally pale except for the places where I didn't get sun tan lotion on properly; leaving strange "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" sunburns on me. We went out for dinner at The Trawler, which was underwhelming but okay (the apps were great actually: shrimp cocktail and fresh steamed mussels). I was a total lazy-ass all weekend and did not want to go out at night. I feel sorry for JM because he went from one girlfriend who couldn't go to bars to another that's too old and pooped out to go to bars. Poor guy.  Sunday we headed right for the beach. We were there until the sound of my skin crisping told us to go. We went to some crab shack place for lunch and had enough crab to last us for quite some time. We both agreed that if we were to ever open a restaurant we also put holes in the middle of the tables that opened up to a trash can below. I felt productive by helping with the clean-up! We went back to the room ('nuf said) and eventually went back to Charleston for a FANTASTIC dinner at Sermet's Corner. We missed the fireworks because we were eating, but the meal was so damn good, we didn't care. We started with a cold cucumber, dill, yogurt soup (delish!) and then JM had some special steak that was so good that you could hardly chew from smiling so much. I had a wonderful eggplant and ricotta pasta dish. It was made complete with a flavorful Merlot, L'Orval, and great bread and dipping oil. Looking back I should have gotten desert. Oh well.  We were the last people in the restaurant and we moved our wine glasses to the bar where we wound up having a great conversation with some of the employees about F911. I LOVE HOW THIS FILM HAS GOT PEOPLE TALKING, no matter if the comments are positive or negative. Our 4th of July evening took a turn for the worse when some jackass hit my car and drove on.   We were at an intersection and JM pointed out that this Jeep Cherokee had been riding our ass. I looked behind me and sure enough, I couldn't even see the dude's headlights he was so close to my car. JM was driving and when the light turned green, he proceeded to go. Immediately the Jeep sped around us on the left side and then tried to pull around us on the front to turn right up the on-ramp that was the cross-street. I say "tried" because the dude's tire hit my front quarter panel. He responded by speeding off up the on-ramp. I was so relieved that JM did not follow him, though he admitted that it was hard for him not to. I understand the typical male desire to "get the guy back" when a wrong has been done to you and yours. But in this case the dude was clearly out of control and following may have only made him more aggresive and dangerous.  Aside from suffering from my shock, all I could do was pray for anyone else who may have been in the car and also for other cars that may come into contact with this dude that night. I hope they're all okay. Though, I must admit that I fantasized about finding out which cosmetic part of this dude's car would be the most expensise to replace and taking a baseball bat to it. te, he. Overall it looks like the damage on my car is only cosmetic, but it does now officially qualify as looking ghetto. It may be a blessing in disguise though because now I might be able to get the money from insurance and pay off some debt.  I have been experiencing some new feelings in relation to JM lately. It seems the more I gain a healthy distance from him, the more close I feel to him. But I am still scared out of my wits to feel too attached to him. I don't trust myself to make good decisions about men anymore (not that I ever did much) as a result of the whole Chris fiasco. But there's no rush and time will tell, I'm sure of it.  Last thing of the day: I had a dream last night in which Chris and my therapist, Randy, gave me a booklet that had information to help me through the divorce. In addition to the self-help stuff, there was also a list of the things I needed to work on and the things that Chris needed to work on. My list had two things on it and Chris' was two pages long. Suddenly Chris was there with me and was asking me why I left him. I started to break down and share with him how much it's torn me up inside to go through our divorce but he quickly took on the role of "rescuer" and it pissed me off. I pushed him away from me and said very clearly: "I made the right decsion then and I still know I made the right decsion now." And then I woke up.

      I was thinking about how wonderful it would be if I could travel to many amazing and exotic places and blog about my experiences when it dawned on me that sight seeing is simply a matter of opening your mind's eyes.When I have the time and brainspace, I love to observe the world I live in. Here are some things of which I have taken note lately:  > An older black man dressed in a banquet servers uniform walking in the warm summer rain down the street. He had a swagger, a "pimp strut" that denoted a power that clashed with his clothing of servitude. Wet and proud he walked home from a day of work.  > An old but shiny blue Ford truck with a bumper sticker that read: NO GARBAGE PLEASE. I remembered having seen this truck before in another part of town. The sides are adorned with Magnetic Poetry. I was happy with the thought of any person being able to come along and express themselves, using a stranger's car and some random words that stick. I tried not to be disappointed when instead of some sort of Harold & Maude-like free spirit, there was a lady wearing a scowl and chipped fingernail polish. I forgave her for the discrepancy and thought about how her thick, dark hair was like what you'd see in a Sears & Roebuck catalogue ad selling McTithe's Potent Hair Tonic.  > You know you live in the ATL when your local convenience store carries beverages called  urlLink CRUNK!  and  urlLink ">Pimp Juice . CRUNK! is brought to you by  urlLink Lil' Jon  and Pimp Juice is made possible in part by  urlLink Nelly . Don't worry y'all. I got the  urlLink 411  on the DL up in herrre, fer sheezy.  (BTW, who saw the ad on VH1 about the "passing" of 'Bling Bling?' Holy crap that was funny!)  > Am I the only person who can see a complete stranger and before they've even left your sight, you've already created your life story with this person? It doesn't happen with everyone - just sometimes I look at a person and we have a first kiss, get married, name our kids and are swinging, old and wrinkly, on the front porch glider bench before I even blink twice. What is it in me that creates these miniature and completely unfounded realities? Hm.   I am off to South Carolina for the holiday weekend and probably won't write again until Tuesday. I wish everyone a happy and safe 4th!

      I have been reading a  urlLink blog  written by an Iraqi mother who has learned English and has been writing about her experiences in Baghdad. She writes in English and Iraqi and posts photos of her world: her home, the streets she drives on, grocery stores and Internet Cafes. It is absolutely fascinating.Here is an excerpt of her most recent post...   And now, how is our life?  Death, destruction, ruins, mercenaries from all nationalities, roaming around in our land, raking havoc, killing people…so that every day passes to more victims, and a far away hope of a peaceful, more settled life.  And then I get e-mails from people asking me why I say we miss our past days…didn't Saddam fall? Didn't you find a new opportunity for a happier life???  And I remember in Saddam's days, how I used to be afraid of the taxi driver, if I speak to him about the government, he might belong to the secret intelligence, and I might go to hell, afraid of the telephone operator if I speak about a forbidden subject, they might inform about me, then I might go to hell. I used to fear the newspaper employee who takes orders for greetings to the president, which I refused to participate in, fearing he would speak about me, and then I would go to hell. I feared the door bell, ringing at noon time, my heart would fall then, I would say: these are the intelligence men to take the satellite receiver and put us in jail, because it was forbidden.  Today all that is gone, Saddam Hussein is gone…but evil isn't gone from the world…and my fear took new shapes.  I fear a stray bullet from a brave American soldier, who was sent here to liberate the back-wards Iraq, and its monstrous people, a bullet that could kill me, or one of my boys, or relatives, or neighbors, or friends. I am afraid of artillery missiles, thrown randomly upon civilian areas at night; when they receive a missile by an Iraqi resistant fighter. I fear trapped cars exploding in the streets of Baghdad, any time, taking along tens of innocent people. I fear the night raids and searching campaigns, presumably looking for weapons or resistant fighters in the houses… where they get into rooms, opening closets and drawers, perhaps steeling some money or jewelry, as so many people we know told us, who were unfortunate to have this happen to them, but to whom they would complain??  And I fear a dark future to a country occupied by a foreigner who dose not love us…but deals with us as if we are scum, and he is the superior who wouldn't make a mistake…

      For  urlLink this *, I love you.   Can I post this?  ...don't be creeped out.       I have been taking things too seriously and getting all caught up in the small details. The bad small details. Or maybe I've been too big picture?  Hell, I have no idea. What I do know is I've not been well. Mixed-up and crazy with confusion and anger and sadness and hurt and fright and God knows what else.  JM has done something very brave and has "let me go." We're "committed friends" now. The idea is by not having a boyfriend that I spend all my time with will allow for the mental, emotional and physical freedom to take care of my Self. And while part of me CRAVES time alone to work through my ever-increasing anxiety, my separation anxiety won't let me be. Last night I was in tears at the prospect of going home alone. I put it off for as long as possible, but I had to do it.  How messed up is that? I can't go home without having an emotional breakdown. I can feel it'll get worse before it gets better. I went through this once before in my "Panic Year" of '97/'98. Long story short: I never dealt with my parent's divorce and so there I was, 13 years after the fact, a bawling wreck on the floor of my dormroom (scaring the bejesus out of my roomie and myself - I didn't know what the hell was wrong with me). I now know that if you don't deal with something, it'll deal with you. Fast-forward to now and it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure out that my still-scarred heart is now going through it again with MY divorce.  I didn't think it would be this hard to get away from someone who was harming me. I am a pretty strong chick and I KNOW that staying with Chris was not an option, so why all of this pain and suffering? I don't know really. All I know is what I experience. It's not like most emotions where you can pinpoint the cause of why you feel happy/sad/loving/etc. It's more like a tornado hitting your house: with no rhyme or reason EVERYTHING is wrecked. I am tired, but can't sleep. I am hungry, but have no appetite. I know I need some time alone, but being alone is the worst thing I can think of right now. I am so damn angry I could scream, but instead I cry.   I was flipping through the blogs I read (and some new ones) and I felt so far away from my usual happy-go-lucky (i almost typed "licky") and charmingly cynical self. (as trite as it may sound, i think i could be Chandler and Phoebe's lovechild)   Right now though? If I had to choose an emoticon to describe me right now, it'd be a flat tire with tears and "^%$^%#!"      *refers to "a hand-holding manifesto, part iii" 7/1/04

      I have posted in here before about how I didn't have many friends growing up. It had to do with a combination of things: moving around A LOT, not being very socially inclined/skilled and also because, looking back, I don't think I believed I deserved them. I am still insecure as to whether I am worthy of a friend. Maybe having friends wasn't even that important to me. No, that's not it. I have pages and pages in my diaries which are heavy and sad with friendlessness. There are even entries praying to God for even just a puppy so I could have a friend of my own, instead of the people that hung around because my Mom arranged for it or told my sister to let me hang our with her and her friends. But that personal truth was challenged when I was looking through my old High School year books. And maybe these people were my friends, but I never felt that connection, never had that SURE feeling that I imagined confirmed friendship between two people.  In my Junior year yearbook, I read something a girl named Christine Kennedy left that didn't seem right, like she was writing in the wrong yearbook, "Hey, I will miss you sooo much! I love you! You're such a great friend and it's sad to see you leave..." but, she addresses the message to me. My name. What? How come I didn't know she was my friend before then? Was she lying or just trying to be nice? Maybe that's it. Although, I can't even tell you how many times upon leaving another school people would approach me "admitting" how much they liked me and how they wished they had said something before. You and me both, people. Perhaps it was my fault though. I think I keep people at bay because I know I am just going to leave again anyway. But what I really think it is, what I am really starting "to get" is that I don't think I ever believed that I deserved a friend. I always just believed that these people were still a part of the scheme to make me feel less bad.  This post is also a result of a gathering of people I probably shouldn't have even assumed I'd be a part of. I see that I am not a part of the circle. I want to be. But I am not. Maybe my blog isn't the right kind or something. I don't know. But even as silly it was of me to think I'd be invited, I was still hurt that I wasn't. Maybe I should have taken the first step and asked to be included, but I was so afraid I'd be turned down, or worse, be invited but no one really wants you there. And, you know, some times it's affirming to be reached out to. To find that someone cares. So instead I lashed out and made a mean comment. And that wasn't fair of me. Ach, it just makes me so sad to feel dis-included (making up my own words makes me feel better, dammit).  Even now I am never really SURE that my friends are really my friends. I can have a huge fight with a boyfriend and I KNOW that it doesn't mean we're breaking up. But if I don't hear from a friend for a few weeks, I immediately start worrying about what I said or did for them to leave me. Or I resort to thinking that they probably were never really my friend to begin with. That it was just a fluke and they've grown tired of me. I accept the role of the one that's left out or left behind easily.  Looking at me, people assume I am A #1, top of the list Miss Popularity. I look the part. I do not fit the "I have felt lonely my whole life" look. And in social situations I am quite the entertainer these days. But that's different from when you're all alone and you FEEL all alone in the world. Yeah, I am friendly as hell, but do I have friends? There is a part of me that still believes I don't deserve it. I know that my friends who read this blog may be thinking, "WTF? Of course we're friends. Isn't she my friend?" The answer is Yes. I  know  I do and that we are. But for some wack-job reason, I still don't  believe  I have friends. I see now that it isn't a matter of what they do, but what I feel. What I accept as truth. My old truth was "I don't have any friends."    I must relearn that. I deserve and I DO have friends.

      I know, i know  - I have been slacker royale. There's just too much going on to even begin writing like I know what the hell's going on. I am VERY tired. I am horny (is that tmi?). I am busy at work with busy work (woo-hoo.). And I am an emotional timebomb waiting to a'splode. Oh, and I have a headache per my regular "Hey! A pounding headache is always good after lunch!" schedule. I just love to replace my painfully empty tummy with a skull full of  expanding  cement.  I had expected to get more "work" done while at my mom's. Like a lot of crying and having revelations and other "trying to get on with my life" crap. But instead I went away feeling even more like I can't do it. I can't handle my job and my divorce and a new boyfriend (JM: do not worry: we are NOT breaking up. I will kick you in the shins if you worry, butthole. I  IV  III) and on top of all that, trying to keep my chin up about it all. Luckily I had one of my great Mom-convos today. (Oddly, the day  after  I was near her.) She mentioned that she was sad that we hadn't had more time to talk and I agreed. Generally I really like my convos with my mom. She's a great cheerleader for me. I told her about my disappointment in my lack of accomplishment during my stay with her. That I had wanted and assumed that I would get some serious healing done while at home.  But I hardly even cried the whole time I was there. For example, I had expected to cry myself to sleep the first night. I didn't. I fell right to sleep. I had expected to cry when I looked at my wedding dress. I didn't. Instead I stared at it in shock, almost as though it were made of some foreign substance and was once worn by an alien and I was the first to discover it. I felt bad about my lack 'o healing and crying and what-not. I felt like I had failed at "dealing with it." I came home yesterday exhausted and distraught. But my Mom saved me by reminding me that healing isn't done on a schedule. I can't  expect  myself to be anywhere than where I am in this. And all I know is that I am  here . And I am still standing, though a bit wobbly.  JM was quizzing me last night, out of concern, about what I was feeling and thinking. I have been shrugging him off all week and he felt left out of the loop. I explained that I simply do not know what I am thinking and feeling. All I know is that I feel icky and dark and gloppy inside. It feels heavy on my heart and makes it hard to breathe. There was also the terrifying suggestion from my mom that perhaps I am not cut out for my job, that maybe it is more than I can handle. I have considered this a few times, but never allowed myself to actively accept it as a real possiblity. I have always been encouraged to keep fighting, to not give up. But maybe this is all too much? Work just seems so unbearable. And I have the hardest time leaving my work-self at the office. I walk around with so much guilt and feelings of responsibility for my participants and their needs, despite knowing that no one would be able to help EVERYONE with EVERYTHING.  I just want to melt away into nothing. Or at least my bed.

       I just saw this email I got from one of my volunteers regarding MR:          MR's brother BR called to let her know that MR had apparently gotten up yesterday afternoon, got fully dressed and said he had an appointment. The other news was that MR passed away last night about 9:45pm. I know most of you had been to see him at one time or another. He always talked of how blessed he was to have found us. Or was it the other way around?        I am glad to hear that he was ready. I will miss him dearly, but I am happy that he will be able to see again and now it will be to witness the prefection of Heaven and all who are there to greet him. YOU ARE FREE!

      I am not blogging as much as I thought I would during this vaca.  I am chatting a lot with the Momster, playing a lot with my baby niece and I'm keeping busy going through all my old stuff (yearbooks, diaries, photos, etc).  Also I have just been "digesting" a lot of information in my head and heart. I am VERY angry with myself for having married Chris. My mom said today that she and Holger feel that it's just such a shame.  I have been calling JM and then was short on the phone. I feel like I should be giving an update and there just isn't anything new or specific to tell. My mom gave me her thoughts on my relationship with JM today. She said he sounds like a great guy - very giving, supportive, productive...  But she shared with me the story of how she came to marry my Dad. A story I'd never heard, nor had I ever thought to ask about. She said my Dad was very charming and giving and worshipped the ground she walked on, which, of course, she liked. But in retrospect she says he was not the love of her life and that perhaps she married him because of all of the nice things he did for her, but not so much becuase she loved him deeply. She said her love for him was much more like a close friend than the butterflies in your belly, passionate and deep kind of love.  I told her of how I had compared Chris to Las Vegas and JM is more like sitting in a rocking chair on a porch watching fireworks. I told her that with JM I can BREATHE. With Chris it was like holding your breath because you never knew what was going to happen next. Yes, with Chris I felt more butterflies and "deep," but I was always on the edge of my seat. There was never a moment of calm or peace. Does the calmness that defines my relationship with JM make it less "true"? I don't know. Can't love be comfortable and simple? And not all flashy and dramatic? I think of the people I felt fireworks with before and they were all nutjobs. I don't think I want that. But shouldn't I be excited at the thought of maybe possibly spending the rest of my life with someone, instead of just feeling lulled?  I don't know. BUT I am willing to try and find out. I want something that's good and right for both people. I want something that is healthy and worthwhile and challenging and exciting. Is that possible? Do I have that right now and I just don't see it?

      I have now compiled what I think are all of my diaries that I have been keeping at my mother's house. There's 16 books here and about another 15 that I have in Atlanta. I have been going through them randomly and am consistently surprised by how much I had forgotten.n I have also made a point to get a different looking diary each time. Some are big, some are narrow, some are plain and some are really fancy. It all depends on my mood. I have even been given blank books that I wound up never using because it didn't fit my mood at that time. (I always felt guilty for that) I find that the best diaries if they are about 81/2 x 6", with college rule, and either spiral bound or bound like an old book (in other words sewn, not glued). If they're too big, they're cumbersome. If they're too small, they cramp your hand. A lot of people tell me they tried keeping a diary but didn't like it. My bet is they were just using a second-rate book.  One of the diaries had a lock on it and I had to find one of those generic tiny lock keys to open it. Sure enough, being th good girl scout she is, my mom had one of those keys. I opened the book and found it was from 1994 from March to December. And then I remembered that I had locked it after the "Cape Cod Condom" incident. In 1994 I moved back to the USA from Germany to live with my Aunt and Uncle in Indianapolis. That winter I spent two grueling days in a car with my mom's parents (Grandma and Grandpa F.)  to get to Cape Cod where my parents live for Christmas. Long story short: my Grandpa didn't fully shut the lid to his car trunk and all of my things got wet. I wasn't there for the ordeal and when I heard that they had gone through everything to lay it out to dry, I nearly had a heart attack. One of the items being hung out to dry was my DIARY. It was the one with a ripped condom wrapper taped in it with the words, "I DID IT!!" written next to it. Naturally.  I was sure that if anyone were to open the diary, it would naturally open to the "marked" page, thus making my deflowerment known to my (eek!) Grandparents, who would in turn make a fuss to my mother about my sinful ways. I had to make a difficult decision. It would be another day before I would have my (wet) things returned to me. I had to assume they had seen it, but I couldn't have my mother finding out about this from them. So in a terrifying pre-emptive move, I sat her down and told my mom I had had sex and that Grandma F. probably knew it by now. Oddly, my mom was more pissed off that I had preserved the moment than the fact that the moment had happened. But it was still one of THE most embarrassing moments in my life. I later found out that my cousin Jenny had quickly decended upon my things and saved my diary from the prying eyes of "the adults." Eventhough it was too late to save face to my mom, Thank You.  BTW: i think these posts are sloppy and misspelled. My mother's keyboard is in the least ergonomically friendly position EVER, so too bad.

      Nothing really new here. I just went through a bunch of old photo albums. One was one that I'd made when I was in the second grade (I think). Looking at the pics of my dressed up as Wonder Woman for halloween and of my family -still intact at that time- makes me long to be in my old skin. There was one photo that stood out to me. It is of me, my Mom, my sister and a couple that my Mom is friends with. In the photo we are standing in front of the Mall in D.C. What makes it worth noting is my Mom's friends in the photo are from Iran. It just struck me to see them, with their smiling faces and beautiful dark skin standing in front of such a prominent and "American"location. Why did this strike me so? I can only guess that it has so much do with our political culture these days. Nowadays it is hammered into our heads that folks from Arabic countries and American monuments don't mix. And that sucks.  However, the main thing that came to my mind was how cool it was that my Mom has always been so open and made friends with just about anybody. I know that I am comfortable with all kinds of people now because I was never shown to not be. I never really was taught to fear or judge anyone, unless they had already harmed me in some way. And my Mom never made a big deal about it, either. There was never any "warning" about people or any kind of explanation as to why they were our friends  eventhough  they were different. They were just our friends and that was that.  I am glad that was the case.  I am tempted to go down to the basement to go ahead and start digging out my old diaries and yearbooks eventhough its getting late. But I am also afraid that I might be confronted with my wedding album or wedding dress down there. (I am sitting here hesitating)  I am surprised I haven't really cried yet. I think I may just still be in shock. Or denial. Or something. I have already seen my dried bridal bouquet and one wedding photo of me and my stepfather dancing (its only sorta on display and as my stepfather put it, "It is valuable to me because it cost a lot of money."  I know he's only being partly serious considering he did shell out $15,000 for my now defunct marriage but also because its a really nice photo and I know he loves me).  I have to get my thoughts in order.  I just wish my mother hadn't admitted to me over dinner that she knew all along about Chris being a flake. I think she was referring to his need to appeal to people, his over-the-top plans and simultaneous inability to get a job. It sucks that I didn't stop it before it was too late. I HATE how I wasted my wedding on this. I wish I could just say, "Oh well, you live and learn" but it feels so much bigger than that. It's not like I bought too expensive curtains and then later regretted it. I can't return this. There is no refund for life.   And I really did try, but maybe I shouldn't have (?). It seems quite clear now that I never should have married him. Because it takes two people, who are BOTH involved, to make it work. Because all he ever fed me were lines. He knew what I wanted to hear. And I think he even believed that doing the things he said he would were good, but he never did anything about it. He never did what he said he was going to do. Why should I feel so damn guilty about leaving someone who couldn't even be bothered to get a job? I mean, that's even necesary for an individual to make it, much less a married couple. I HATE FEELING THIS WAY.  Mmmnh. I bet the posts over the next few days are going to be bummers. I apologize in advance.

      I am now sitting at my mother's computer in her office/laundry room. It's actually far from the dismal picture you probably have in your head - it is just off of her "fabu" kitchen and has two huge windows that face the backyard. (roar can attest to this)  It is very upsetting to be here. No. That's not it. I am happy to be here. But I am having a hard time being in the house where I got married (almost one year ago in one month) and seeing the stairs I walked down to reach my future husband who was standing at the alter in the side yard, the spot where I stood opening wedding gifts, etc. This is the problem: I am sad that this place no longer represents safety and comfort, but rather the beginning of a really bad dream.  But everyone here seems happy and healthy. My wonderful Tobi-dog is still running around thinking he's a puppy at age 9, my stepfather is tinkering on his boat, my little bro is still the coolest ever, my young nephew is so very sweet and I got my meet my new niece, who, so far, seems to be the easiest baby ever. She smiles and gurgles and then went right to sleep when we put her down for her nap.  I already called JM twice today. I wonder how I'll feel tonight when I go to sleep - all alone. I am trying to relate to my parents how wonderful he is, but I think it's coming across as me trying too hard, which probably doesn't make me look very good - not seeming to be realistic and all. I am going to join the parentals on the porch now... I'll write more later!

      I think I may lose one of my favorite clients before I return from my vacation. We already lost two men last week. This is fucking hard. He is so sweet and he really kept his chin up so much. He was asking me to visit him, but I kept putting off seeing him. I was too busy to get down to the hospital to visit him. I was often the only one in the office...but still... I am so sorry MR.  I am so sorry.

      Latest keywords to find my blog: "video broke from sadness" "dave barry bear in big blue house"  And three searches for Bobcat Goldwaith.  I feel sorry for Bobcat. If people are landing on my blog, that means there must not be much out there about him. One of the keywords was for his "official webpage."  Wow. I guess I'm the closest thing to his official webpage? That sux.  Can I tell you how much I like these things...? (very much) * Most of the new Wilco album (except for all of the damn distortion - SO overused by the indie-crowd, dudes! and the song with nothing for 10 minutes. I know, artisitic freedom and all that crap, but hey, why not just make a shorter song?) * The first half of the FiveEight album. Can you beat lyrics like, "The lights are like liquor, cuz they're my favorite pill." ? (no.)

      Sorry I've been MIA. Very busy at work.  I had a dream last night that all of my blogging friends (you guys!) were at this summer camp-type thing. And my car wasn't running right and some lady tried to tell me how to do my job and then Justin Timberlake asked me to join him in the middle of the dance circle (much to my fellow bloggers chagrin) and then he started shooting a fake gun and everybody thought he was a looser for waking the neighbors.  I woke up with the realization that my briefcase had been stolen the other day when my car was broken into. WTF, people. Why can't people leave my car (and other belongings) well enough alone? I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I guess I'm lucky: when my car was hit by the drun driver, no one was hurt. When my car was broken into, they didn't take my new stereo, just empty cd cases and my cheap T.J. Maxx briefcase. (althogh there may have been credit card info in there, so I could have my identity stolen! on the other hand, we're talking about someone who stole empty cd cases - it it possible they would not know how to steal "me").  On a much better note: JM has now officially spolied me. I am now a real spolied girl. Last night he "officially" asked me to be his girlfriend by getting down on one knee in Piedmont Park(freaked me out) and presenting me with a diamond necklace and bracelett. These things are, without a doubt, the nicest (read: prettiest and most expensive) gift any guy has ever given me - and that includes my engagement ring and wedding band from what'shisface. I am very much the bling bling, y'all.  And then there's this thing about prayer that I have been wanting to write about. I really want to start praying more often. There was a bunch of introspective thoughts I wanted to share on the subject, but I didn't write them down in my notebook, so I have no idea anymore what they were.  Wow. This is a strange and rather disappointing post for you guys, isn't it? I am leaving first thing tomorrow for my Mom's house. I will be posting from there.  PS: I tried to email my former mother-in-law yesterday about the photos, but apparently she has blocked my email address. She must really be afraid of me. What does she think I am going to do? Spam her to death? This is getting to be absurd.
