						   the chinese have a curse " may you live in interesting times"...its supposed to be BOTH a curse and a blessing. talk about an oxymoron. Lately, it seems I have been 'blessed' by the entire damn state of china in unison. I am living in VERY VERY interesting times....here are a few animals I am trying to pin down before they devour me to my bones :  8239-my nemesis. now the tag line changes to " just when you think it can't get worse, it DOES !!!"  VK-the unstable little bright flame in my day. God bless GCCR!  HR opening - the chinese 'blessing' disguised asa job. results out on friday.  D&L move - embroiled in a lot of dark back room dealings. welcome to CSD on a good day!  $$$$ - can someone show me where this 'money' thing is ... ??? what does it look like ???  ok...gotta scoot...more later...keep tuned....ciao

						   Well well...another milestone passed....another year lost to chain smoking, impecunious living and aimless meandering at work and home.Anybody who has the imbecilic urge to ask me where all this is heading will get this response : my plan for life is as solid as silly putty. Outdoors. On a rainy day.  Let me be honest. I am pretty content at the moment.let's count the blessings children : great friends, peachy job with generous pay (for what value addition I cannot fathom), chilled out pad, I am in great shape inspite of an almost scary addiction to smoking, my family is hale and hearty and 3000 kms separate my dad and me :) and NO debts. At 26 its a good deal I think. I know the sour asses(well meaning) will point out the flip side before you can say "DANGER WILL ROBINSON!" but hey! it could be WORSE people. I have come a long way from my nerdy days of yore and I am proud of the transformation. I know I sound defensive but then you ralise you guys have one ally on your side who indeed does manage to get under my skin with his pricky rants. My Ambition. He hits where it hurts. And it does. I'll tackle him tomorrow :)  Glad i came to the office. Got quite a bountiful bday loot already.books.cap.card.cake.cute ashtray.choclates.the evening is going to one big BONG (weed through water) session with the boys. Moody has released a 'SELL SELL SELL!!!' rating on my lungs. good move guys.  Think I'll top it with some animal sex tomorrow. just to get off to a good start for this year.just got off the assessment at work. ferraried though a 4 hous test in 90 minutes. The grey matter is on full throttle today. would have preferred to spend some quality time with VK but the ice princess won't have the bravura to ask her folks for late night perm.well, c'est la vie. guess its SC,SS or SJ then for the weekend. Maybe 'squeeze' in DA as well .RFOL. DS has been hankering I spend some quality time with her on sunday. i should but i rather chill with the hommies.  The 8 odd of training has been a profligate surfing orgy...i may be mailed some award from the net gatekeepers. That or spammed to death. but yesterday it stuck in in the middle of a case resolution how much this has come to bore me...I want out , GodFather. if HR does not work out I think i am going to try for a TL role....D&L move has taught me like no other episode about how CHANGE actually is beneficial to one's life...i am not moving my cheese now...i am smashing it outta the stadium. part of me wants to ditch 8239VK,AMEX and DELHI for keeps. not becoz its bad(au contraire)but becoz its a little too good. go figure that out.  I am off to some generous lunch. courtesy my ex-Boss.

						   Managed to drag my sorry ass (sorry but oh-so-cute of course :) to Daksh and Convergys to market the white elephant...my cavalier attitude towards the impending 8500 Defcon 2 level crisis is only humbled by my even more non-chalant attitude towards my MBA plan. That one on a priority scale stands right besides the urgent need I have to poke red hot needles into my buttocks. But atleast I have some needles at home. for the MBA i just have a pencil ready. yep, that's pretty much it. Harvard here I come !!!  The games with VK is full on....she's so damn torpid about EVERYTHING >:

						   Update : The cursed trajectory to D&L worked. Gnnnnahhh !!!! Now I have to prove myself all over again.....fuck !  Warcraft 3 >> like Arthas corrupted by Frostmorne, I too have succumbed to the cheat codes...liberally using it and so managed to reach the elves enchanted forest...for the first time i ashamed of my character and his victory...and did someone notice the damn storyline is almost too close to LOTR ???....or is it only me.....i am going mad on this game :) glod bless the land the BLIZZARD designers walk on....although i have to admit, C&C and Half Life still beat this game hollow.  Bday on the 4th...>> the day comes near and so do the questions that inevitably cast a morose shadow after the party .... what are you doing with your life?? where the hell are you heading ???----- wait!! that's my weekly conversation with dad.sorry.  Dilbert does'nt hold a candle to the hilarious dramas at my dept...my boss is as sharp as a racoon with its tail on fire. his boss is as clued in as Johnny Bravo. If the place sold season passes I would buy it !! My buds GD and Bala help me survive the laugh-a-riot here. Ambition here is as welcome as a Jew to the Palastine Beer Party.  ok....gotta go..the energy stick calls.

						   Friday/ June 4 -2004  2000 hrs: the killing frezy on the LAN hits an all time high. Bala is fragged before he can draw his second breath, I am crippled without my right mouse button and Sanwaria and Player ambush all 3 of us in every environment. Frustating but great fun. WebWorld is looking like the new hangout place for me and 'UNREAL 2003' the new definition of pure unadultrated pleasure.  2200 hrs: Gorgeous Bean Bag as gift from buds, we guys are 30 beer bottles down, brains fried out after the BONG and PJ loose motion on. Paritosh,GD,Mohan and Bala listen with the 'this guy's lost it' look. they are dead on! In walks Shruti. Circle is complete. All my close people are in. Package is secured HQ. I feel good about this circle I have. Quality people. Wonder if i deserve it.hmmmmmm............  0100 hrs: lights out. rather my lights are knocked out. Mohan (in a supremely wise move) decides to crash over.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Saturday  0900 hours: wake up,open fridge door. what better was to start your day than Nes-BEER !! the bean bag is heaven itself. plop it in front of the tv and wait for mohan to wake up.he sleeps quite late. that or the bong was more vicious than he anticipated. Café Coffee Day wakes us up.....groggy but sober. decide never to do the bong again. for the 46328 th time. muse over what to do now. call VK. get invited over to her place for lunch. one month late but the bet with bala is closed. 'lost the battle but won the war' is how i put it ;) Read the previous sentence for the a good defination of 'Hubris'.   14:00 : drop into her place, see her albums, nice lunch with beer (again) and then she belts out some songs for me. wow.can the lady sing or what! she's actually damn f*****g good. her mom drops in. sounds chilled but VK warns me otherwise. whatever :p felt good hanging out. pester her for the party tonight but she's all cold on that plan.déja vu.oh well......I have a few tactics up my sleeve.have to when you are dealing with Ms.Taliban Morals 2004.  2100: GD and gang are over. Smirnoff bottle out. Quick slip into Provogue. We are off to THE DECK, VK says she'll be over in an hour.he he. the power of a well placed temper tantrum :) All looks good. Club hitz off 5 minutes after we land up (charisma? bad breadth probably ) then we get the vibe they are closing off at mid-night. Nakul and Tanya are blocked at entrance. so now we HAVE to scoot off from there. still no VK. I am pissed. she skids in just as we are off. WTF?... but its too late so we head off to MIRAGE. TC and GD go crazy in the car over some silly tiff. but we reach Mirage in one shaken piece.  0000: Mirage has 567 people waiting outside to be let in. STUDIO 54 would have died of envy. some of the booty there was unbelievable. Impatient us decide to head to LIZARD LOUNGE. BIG mistake :( 97367456084 chinky stags going beserk. SS and gang land up outside. GD and TC head off to my pad to make out. I decide to hitch my fate with Vikram and Shiv.  0300 : I am at Vikram's place downing shooters and a joint and wonderin what the fuck am i doing there ??? how the hell did i land up with SS and gang. FP makes a complete ass of herself. The whole thing seems so surreal. Cake is living upto her rep. Pity Nikhil.  0630: we are in the lobby of Ambassador belting out songs in our loudest voice, waiting for YBC to open for bfast. the weather is SOOOOO awesome one could cry. and i am with this harrowing motley crowd.  0730: they open for bfast. I don't eat as much as i go a omnivorous orgy. of all that has transpired in the last 10 odd hours, this is the best part. 850 in damages. hustled it off ;)  0900 : crash out.wake up briefly.VK calls. give her the low down on the evening. sure woke HER up i think.  1800: chill out at the book café with mohan and shruti. get dominoes and chow at CCD ! cheeky = me :)  2200 : lights out. end of the bday weekend. Phew!  it was a 3 days rampage of weed,beer,booze,junk food and limited sleep. damn! that felt gooooood. One more like this again and I am going to wind up in the ICU.

						   Many of you keep asking wnat the hell was the raison d'etre for the ridiculous URL for my blog.  Allow me Gentlemen.  CSD is the acronym for my department. It expands gracefully into 'Customer Services Disputes'. Quite a mouthful huh ? I used to work in a 16 member team there , that for some ludicrous reason named itself INXS.After that rock band of the Farriss brothers. The team leader Rahul Singh has been trying for the last 22 odd months to manage this motley bunch. Believe me when I say it, the team is a formidable awe-inspiring bunch of self starters and an astonishingly competitive bunch. It is, in a building of 1500 odd people, one of the BEST. Some say THE best. So good they don't need a leader. y  You know how some people work best when told the goal,time and resources and then the messenger gets the hell outta the way. This team is a living personification of that statement. So no one misses Rahul. No one needs him. No one wants him around. He's pretty harmless too. The CYA types(CYA= Cover Your Ass). and so his image around the team is , he's the proverbial frog in the pond who will dive for cover the moment he percieves any trouble. you are on your own kiddo. that's a pretty sad state of affairs but after 22 months the hardened veterans ahve come to terms with it and now even accept is without too much fuss.     When I started this blog, it was meant to be an snapshot of the office politics and the Dilbertisqe behaviours of the various players in the game. and what better URL that the one named after my clueless boss (now ex).so frogatcsd.blogspot.com.  and in other news....  1# My House VK8239 has becomes the sourspot in this otherwise blissful little paradise here :) It keeps me on edge pretty much ALL the time now. Need to find a permanent solution. Quickly.  2#VK.Blow hot.Blow cold.Watch this space.  3#SS.SHe's back.again.who can resist that booty.like AL Pacino would say "..things are heating up!"  4# Very Imp presentation to AMEX GIO Head on friday. A lot is on the line here. if it clicks, i'll coast on the laurels for a good 6 months. If it flops, its a HUGE setback. Honest opinion : Put the money on me. I'm really good at this kinda stuff.
