                     So on my way to work today my parents start telling  me how I better start getting my thoughts together because if we leave in a  couple of months then I'm going to have to finish school in Chile. Fuck that. I  don't want to go and I can't go back until I'm done with HS here.I got my SAT  results today and I received a 1200, I guess that's good, but I don't really  care. I don't even want to write in this today, but I'm trying to write no  matter what. I guess you can tell that I'm disorganized and just pissed off. I  don't give a fuck right now. And of course, as soon as I reach work I get pissed  off because it is pointless and feel that no one would care if I don't fold that  one Thundercats shirt all messed up and on top of the Superman. who cares. on  the plus we helped out Micah, from Spencer's, Dog fund. His dog is dying of a  tumor and so we decided to have&nbsp;a little donation cup thing to put change  and shit into. He's a good guy. On Katie watch: haven't seen her in three weeks.  Anyways, when my parents came by later to work to talk to my boss, who they're  friends with, and drop off a cinabon, I tried to stay as far away from them as  possible. I don't know why I can't stand them, they're good people and want  nothing but the best for me. But I won't have it.oh, well. Earlier in the day,  before work, I talked to Danielle Mirabal, a friend, who I haven't talked to in  about a month. I haven't really talked to anyone in over a month. I've lost  touch of people. I have a lot of acquaintances, some friends, but no best  friends, or&nbsp;a friend that I would entrust my whole heart to. Danielle for  instance I considered to be one of my best friends, but look at it. I haven't  talked to her in about a month and she hasn't called me and I haven't called  her. why? who knows. I feel shitty. This journal entry is by far the ugliest  thing I have ever written or read...except for basically everything on George W.  Bush's website. that's pure bullshit.

                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up today just in time for  lunch. We had pasta with tomato sauce, it was spaghetti but with a different  pasta if you know what I'm saying. After I finished my scrumptious lunch I went  upstairs and talked on AIM for a little while. I talked to Heather, a friend of  mine from school, about all the lovely affairs that she's having. I kinda had a  thing for her, as in I would if I could, but it's very unattractive when she's  writing me telling me how she's hooking up with her ex-bf's roommate, while  she's talking to this one motherfucker from Oklahoma who she had a one nighter  with when she was staying over there...I don't know, you know?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was done listening to my  slutty friend I listened to Tool's Lateralus CD, It kicked ass!!! Not as if it's  the first time I listen to it or anything but it kicks ass!! that killed an hour  and a half after which I had to go off to work. My Dad took me, and of course as  always a deathly silence was in the air the entire trip. We said two words to  each other, both were by him. I don't know why but my Dad pisses me off, what  pisses me off is I don't know what. He tries to get close to me but I won't have  any of it. Time will hopefully tell.&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley, Erica, and I&nbsp;where  working today. Our boss Carlos was supposed to be working but couldn't because  his car broke down. I don't think I've talked about Erica so to describe her:  she's around 5,3 and 22 pounds, skinny as shit! She's a brunette of Hispanic  decent(even though she doesn't speak Spanish). Now to talk about her skinniness,  when we first saw her the only thing I could think of was Callista Flockhart.  That skinny!! Anyways, all she talked about today, were all the drugs she's done  in the past, how she came to work high, and how she was going to smoke and drink  so much tonight...lovely. I've known this girl for about a week, and she's  acting like we've known each other so long that we need to share our troubled  path...what the fuck!!! It pissed me off, although the drug thing might also  have something to do on why she's so skinny.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started talking to Shelley  about how much it's starting to piss me off working there. I told her how I was  starting to hate the job. It's so fucking pointless!! All we do is fold shirts.  I have no adventure in my life. Just read this fucking journal and you can tell  to what point is my level of excitement. That's one of the main reasons why I  want to go to the Marines, and become a Marine sniper. Reconnaissance would be  the best thing for me, training for impossible missions, and&nbsp;never taking a  step backward and doing things that others don't dare do. I need that in my  life.Nothing else to talk about work.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fahrenheit 9/11 came out today  and I'm hoping I get a chance to see it Sunday, if anyone else decides to go  with me. I need better friends, I don't enjoy my friends right now. I haven't  talked to any of them for around a month. They&nbsp;haven't even called me. I'm  tired and now I'm pissed off so I'm going to go to  bed.

                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a Thursday, so as always my  grandmother comes by the house and her and my mom, my brother, and my sister go  on a shopping trip to Wal-mart or to Kroger like a big happy family...yay!  Anyways, so I had the house all to myself for a couple of hours which I spent on  taking a shower and trying&nbsp;to finish up Dracula. Unfortunately, I had to  put it down one chapter before the end. Around 2 o'clock my mom and grandma, or  Jojo, as I know her came back with some Pizza-hut. I gobbled down a pepperoni  and 2 cheese slices and got ready to go to work. I had to be at work by four but  since I don't have a car I had to hitch a ride with Jojo on her way to her home  in Conroe.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said bye to everyone, and left  with my Grandma for work...that makes me feel so grown up saying that. Anyways,  on my way there we talked about the Da Vinci Code, which I made her get addicted  to, and also talked about the 7 DVD set of WWII films I bought yesterday(  yesterday in an infomercial came up a 2-DVD set of WWII films for the low, low  price of 29.95, so I called TimeLife to buy them, but the Indian guy who was  reading from apparently a booklet or cheatsheet of some sort, told me about a  special of 7 DVD's for 4 EASY, AND CHEAP PAYMENTS OF 24.95 EACH...I loved the  deal and immediately fell in. But come on 7 fucking DVD's of rare wwii  footage!!!ehhh...ehhh.). My step-grandfather was in world war ii, Korea, and  Vietnam so he's a military man himself as he finished up his career as a colonel  and went to work in the Pentagon, so it interested her deeply.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I got to the Woodlands  Mall, I work in a store called Freestyles, I saw that in my watch it said 2:25  so I went to the new Barnes and Noble and sat determined to kill time until 4  o'clock. I drank a Venti Cappuccino and finished off Dracula (so fucking  great!!!!) and finished my time magazine cover issue on Clinton. I was very  impressed with Clinton and in fact so impressed that I felt inclined to pay 25  dollars for his book...yeah I know, but I had to....don't judge me!!!....it was  four so I went upstairs to Beyond Image to see if the&nbsp;Katie, the  girl&nbsp;I had a crush on, was there, she wasn't. It pisses me off  because&nbsp;I haven't seen her in weeks!!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I had finished mourning I  went to work, where Emily invited me to a party on fourth of July to celebrate  her new home. I'm not much of a party person but I think I'll go.then just let  the rest of the day pass by. A girl who has this huge crush on Michael came by,  her name is Rachel, and started a conversation with him. Now I like Rachel (not  in that way), so I pick on her, she's a pretty girl with a great smile ,  pink-highlighted hair, and for some fucked up reason likes the spice girls,  she&nbsp;just graduated high school and is going to move to Austin, making it  the main reason why Michael doesn't want to become involved with her. So as I  said, I pick on her and she got a little frustrated, so I stopped and didn't  move from the place I had been standing for about 5 minutes. Her phone rang and  she took it somewhere so she wouldn't be bothered. When she comes back she  grabbed Michael and started whispering to him 2 feet away from me!! When I  looked at her she yelled at me, "Oscar, why are you always in my fucking  business, seriously you're starting to get on my fucking nerves!" I didn't know  what I did wrong. Apparently she had been called by her mom and had been pissed  off..whatever.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on Rachel(diff. one, she  has short blond hair and is gay) from Beyond Image came by looking for plugs,  while showing her I sneaked in the question, "I haven't seen Katie for a while,  does she still work there?" Katie had found a second job working at the Sonic at  Louetta and Ella, but even Rachel didn't know what was going on with her, for  apparently she hadn't been in for a while...damn it!!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;around&nbsp;7:30&nbsp;Daniel Mendoza came  by, again from Beyond Image, and him and I went to get food from the Food Court.  Oh yeah, Daniel got his nose pierced on the side, and doesn't look that bad. I  was playing around with him and I accidentally hit him on his nose and hurt him.  At the food court we split, he went to Wendy's while I went to Chick-Fil-A. he  finished before me and we started talking to the girls that work at Chick, and  during our conversation one of the girls asked him how big his plugs were and  when Daniel went to grab his ear he accidentally knocked over all the freaking  brownies from their display. They all laughed about it so it was  cool.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately at&nbsp;8:30  these two kids wanted a board and grip tape, I sold them a board and told them  to get it gripped at Beyond Image because it would be cheaper and sent them a  little message to Daniel telling him to grip it. 5 minutes later these kids come  back and give me the board and grip tape and it has a note that says, "Here you  can grip tape it you fag." So I went down there and told him off jokingly and  went back defeated to grip the board.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After work Michael dropped me  off at home and I ate some left over pizza from the day and read Harry Potter  for a bit. I put Harry Potter down after a couple of chapters and began "Angels  and Demons" by Dan Brown, the same guy who wrote the Da Vinci Code, I hear this  one is good so I read a little bit of that. Then I sat down and wrote this for  about half and hour... great, I have nothing better to do. Because of that I  shall retire for the night, so until I write again I bid  you...goodnight!

      So, this is a new idea for me, to write a journal on the internet for all to see, hopefully, anybody that reads this won't know me. I don't have to much to write today, for my life sucks, not in "I want to kill myself" way but as in "i'm so fucking bored" kinda way. I woke up around 11 o'clock where I started reading some Dracula, great book about, you guessed it Dracula(I'm in the part where Mina has been biten, and van helsing and the gang start going to bless all the boxes). It's getting preety damn intense, but anyways, our house is for sale, so a couple of people came by to check it out, didn't even notice how nicely I had cleaned my room 5 minutes before they got here, and then left. After lunch i sat down and started practicing tarot cards. I'm still only learning the Major Arcana's but I'm getting to know the cards much better. Afterwards, I watched the first harry potter and found out that the reason Snape was so freaking familiar in the movie was because he was Hans in Die Hard, I knew i recognized him but i couldn't figure it out. After I released that load of my back I came to the computer where i typed all the shit i had done in the day. Which brings me to now! I have nothing else to say since I have nothing else to do for the day, so until next time...Au Revoir.

                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up at around noon and all  I did all day was read Harry Potter. In fact, I believe that after this I will  be able to finish it.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted originally to go see  Fahrenheit 9/11 but was shot down when no one wanted to go with me. Danielle  said she couldn't and didn't give reason, all the guys where having a poker  tournament, and Michael was hanging out with friends, and Frank Mistretta wasn't  around. So I was stuck.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the day, I watched  "Larry King Live" and Bill Clinton was on the show. I'm very impressed with Bill  and I'm really starting to like him. I still think he didn't know how to go to  war or even aid in international conflicts, kind of like in Somalia, where he  pussied out and brought the troops back. He even defended President George Bush  on a few affairs (no pun intended) such as the ongoing war and 9/11. I also very  much like the fact that he's very supportive on the war against AIDS. Finally,  we see a different side of Clinton.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the dullness of the  day, I have nothing left to write, so adios.
