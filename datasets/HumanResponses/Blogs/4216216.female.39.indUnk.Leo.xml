        empty beer cans in your walk-in closet  waking up naked in your walk-in closet with bbq tongs and an onion still in your hands  a small petrified black object on the grill which at one time was some form of meat and no memory of starting the grill  skid marks in the living room  a video camera, tv and vcr set up in the bathroom  waking up Tuesday with 23 messeges from work which were left on Monday  acute pancreatitis  waking up on the hood of your car in the Nevada desert and wondering why you parked so far from the surf  finding your little dog immobilized wearing a full body duct tape "suit of armor"  answering the door of your apartment to a security guard saying "I just wanted to check on you...as you may or may not know, I helped you up here last night after getting a call about a possible dead body in the bushes."

            Did anyone see that photo of John Kerry on the flight deck of the space shuttle in that little bunny costume? Where were the ears, the pink nose and whiskers? To me he looked like a cross between an Oompa Loompa and Woody Allen in the movie "Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex but . . ." where he was playing a sperm with the exact costume . . .  only in white (of course).         Even funnier is the fact that after it hit the press, his camp got all panicked and embarrassed. They are calling it a "leak" saying that he just happened to be taking a "legitimate" tour  of the flight deck (who wouldn't have time for  that  during a campaign?) and the republicans got ahold of the photo and distributed it with the intention of making him look like a boob. Maybe that's true, but it doesn't take anyone else to make him look like the boob he is. He does just fine on his own. Who does Kerry's camp think they're kidding? They arranged this photo-op and it backfired on them. I know this is trivial but so is he and I'm having fun with it.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always heard how bad things do, or at least seem to, come in threes. I must say that I've noticed that too. I don't give it any credence but it sure seems to turn out that way. So what the hell is going on here now?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My boss is pissed at me, my parents are pissed at me, my 17 year old is on probation and under house-arrest and trying to get out of control again (and thus pissed at me), all three of us have been sick off and on for a week and a half, I have IRS trouble, I got two tickets in one stop last weekend, because of that I'm gonna have major trouble paying them plus the light bill and my ISP bill, my friends dad died, another friend is having child/marital troubles that may not get worked out, there is a case of lice going around my youngest daughters group of friends, my next door neighbor lost his job and now I feel like I need to help them out with groceries, my truck just got out of the shop after an $860.00 brake job which took two days, I needed those two days to get caught up at work, the ex wife is starting rehab on Monday meaning that I won't be given back the child support checks that the state garnishes from my wages (the girls live with me, btw). There may be more but I'm tired of thinking of it all.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would apologize for being so negative but I don't see the need as I'm the only one that reads this. Cheers!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so sick and tired of teenaged girls that I could just spit Napalm. There is no other creature on this planet that is as self-centered, selfish, bitchy or sneaky. They think of no one and nothing else but thier own stupid, shallow-minded selves and thier pathetically shallow, narrow-minded little lives.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just saw "The Hives" on Letterman. I had never heard of them until a few weeks ago when I saw a promo for the show. I understand that the high, tinny sound, the costumes and the haircuts are part of the shtick. And I defy anyone to tell me that the singer is not in love with Mick Jaggar . . . but I thought they were a pretty kick ass band.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got attacked by blackbirds the other day.&nbsp;In Texas we have this ugly,  stupid  bird here called a Grackle. It's commonly called a blackbird. They look like a genetic experiment between a crow and a Myna bird gone awry. The other day I was in the Med Center near downtown walking&nbsp; down a block that had Magnolia trees all along the curb and I heard them squawking. I had never heard them make that sound before but I knew that it meant "bad". Then I noticed that three of them were following me, hopping from tree to tree . . . still making that awful sound that I now&nbsp;knew was directed at me. When I got out of the tree line (mind you this is in the med center) they started dive-bombing me. I dropped everything and just started swinging aimlessly. They got a few pecks in on my head and all I did was make a few blind swipes at them. When it was over I was laughing my ass off and noticed that everyone at the intersection was too (at me).&nbsp;Hopefully with me.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I'm exhausted with no light at the end of the tunnel, I have all the usual financial woes and&nbsp;I'm convinced the girls are plotting my death. I'm on to 'em. They are using those  daughter  powers to&nbsp;shut down most, if not  all  of my vital organs.&nbsp;Meaning,&nbsp;&nbsp;they push me over the edge, I die a "natural"&nbsp; death and they go "scott-free" to live whatever life it is that I'm not letting them live.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send help.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two questions to ask of anyone who may see this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp; In your opinion, &nbsp;did it or did it not appear that Mike Piazza sold out Roger Clemens in that all-star game here last weekend?&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a band&nbsp; called "flipmode"? (what looked like a tour bus today with&nbsp; 'flipmode' logos &nbsp;all over it nearly drove over me before I could get out of the left lane of I-10 to let it by).

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; so damned glad to be back home. In my opinion, San Antonio is not a very fun place to be. My job has had me there &nbsp;once or twice a month (several days each) for nearly 10 years. I'm tired of driving and I'm tired of hotel/motel rooms. &nbsp;I shouldn't bitch though, it used to be Palestine,&nbsp;Round Rock, Austin, Wimberley, Universal city ,&nbsp;San Antonio , then Corpus Christi. The out of town accounts have been whittled&nbsp;down to just San Antonio, and just today I &nbsp;finished training the guy who will be taking care of that for me from now on. &nbsp;So, hopefully, &nbsp;no regular&nbsp;monthly roadtrips anymore. &nbsp;(In all fairness, I should mention what San Antonio  does  offer like no other place: the riverwalk and the&nbsp;carefree mood it puts you in, the undisputably best Tex-Mex in the universe and a dense population of some seriously stunning Mexican cuties).

        It's Wednesday! That's too many days away from Friday! :P The last few weeks have been so hectic, I so need a vacation...It's become apparent to me, that my transfer out-of-town is not going to happen until all of the audits and major pain in the ass work here is done! I suppose it's only fair not to stick a new manager with all of it, but I really didn't want my son to start school here and then have to leave in the middle of it. *sigh* I've spent two years at this complex and I'm so burned out on this place...the people here are driving me over the edge, which seems like a very short drive at this point! But anyhow, I wrote up a nice bitch letter for my tenants and attached the rules and regulations to it...(in hopes that they will actually read it), and had to attach a few information forms as well....so now I get to pass them out and wait for the morons, who can't read simple directions, to ask me what I need....uhg! My old boss told me I can't write big words on my memos, she told me to lower myself to their level and type my memos, to my tenants, in language that they can understand, hahahahaha....I don't know that I can think in redneck hillbilly terms......but I'll give it a shot! So that is my big goal for the day....that and my son gets his eye glasses today...yippee....no more whining about not being able to see! I've been working 3 apartment complexes for the last few weeks. It's actually kind of been nice to be so busy, but I'm tired.           On another note........I was forced to have lunch with a gay guy yesterday....was rather amusing...he told me I make him want to go straight...I suppose that was a compliment, although I about died of embarrassment when he kept telling everyone in the restaurant. Was certainly a different experience....one that I won't be doing again as long as I can help it! :)          Well, I'm off to work I'm evicting 2 people, so I have to find 2 replacement tenants.....that's always fun! One of them will get to live next to me...so I have to find someone who can tolerate me and doesn't get on my nerves...hahaha! Like that will ever happen!          Linda

            Thanks QT for keeping things rolling here. I've been really busy and have not been able to get anything done here. I only have the energy for one more sentence. If only I could explain.

      Ahhh, it's Saturday at last, no work, no school, and the weather is absolutely beautiful!  But, it hasn't started off well.....I'm hoping it gets better......I was awakened by a drunk calling me at 4:00 am....a friend, whom apparently has more in mind than just the friendship he and I have agreed to have.....why me?  So....I talk to the drunk, who is asking me all sorts of personal questions,  for a good half hour or more...then manage to get back to sleep...wake up at 7:30 or so (Ever notice how you wake up early and full of energy on your days off and can hardly muster up the energy to get out of bed on work days?), my son makes me my coffee as usual, and all is going well, then the ex husband calls and wham, the day is ruined...seems he and my son were having a disagreement, my son had told him I wasn't home....so I hear my kid defending me with his dad and I'm like, wtf is that all about, I grab his phone and say why are you threatening me to my kid?  He's telling my kid if I take him back to court again, he's going to burn my ass......HAHAHAHAHAHA......you would have to know me to understand this, but I do absolutely nothing wrong at all!  I don't even go out, I stay home and raise my child, like a good mother should....and his father on the other hand is an alcoholic and pothead....and does both in front of my child...I should probably take him back to court just for the satisfaction of proving him wrong.....but anyhow....we argue for a bit and it's done.  Now, for the rest of the day.....I have to evict 2 single mothers, each with a child today....for not paying their rent...my job really sux sometimes, but ho well, you gotta pay your rent if you want to have an apartment.  Sure hope this day gets better, and I hope others are having a better one! ;) (I know this day is going to get better and that later I'm going to have something wonderful to post!)  Enough whining!

       I've never been the type to "surf" the internet. I have always had something specific to do online. However, when all is done, I sometimes find myself with nothing left to do (exciting life, eh?). So, I thought I would offer some links for those in the same situation. Some of these links I came across by accident and some I actually hunted down. The weird ones were found by accident, the practical ones were actually searched for. I will list the practical links first, then the weird ones.     urlLink http://www.cooltext.com/  For those interested in HTML and web site design, this is a very handy site for getting pre-fab graphics. They have logos, fonts and buttons. Maybe more, I just don't remember. The choices are somewhat limited, but it's extremely easy to use and very fast.    urlLink http://www.findsounds.com/  This is a .wav locater. I understand that "dailywav" has thousands of .wavs, but this site allows you to search for specific sounds unrelated to movies, TV or cartoons although that is available too.    urlLink http://www.howstuffworks.com/  This has to be the best website   ever created  ! It's the finest site I have ever seen. Anything your mind can come up with, this site will tell you all about how it works, and even in greater detail than you may need (or care to know ).  A definite  must-see  site.    urlLink http://www.netsurfing.com/surfcam/index  This is a very helpful site for surfers and fisherman. It provides weather, tide and surf information. It also has a very cool surfing video game you can play. But the best feature on this site, in my opinion, is the surfcam. It shows the surf (surfside beach, my fav) from a camera mounted on a house right on the beach. The image normally reloads every ten minutes. I like it because I can take a look at the surf in the morning right from my desk here and then decide whether or not to go out there.      AND NOW . . . SOME ODDITIES OF THE WEB

       I guess it pays to browse other blogs at 4 or 5 in the morning. I happened to wake up around 4:00 AM and found this:   Some young kook in Florida (kook: meaning, look at the guys profile pic) has a couple of photos of a supposed "ufo" over downtown Houston during the all-star game. It's a fabrication. A lame attempt at a hoax. If there really was something in the sky over downtown Houston that night it was a blimp.   For fun's sake, check out the link.     urlLink http://blogg.somewhiteguy.com/2004/07/ufo-over-houston.html

       Summer is over at the greg household. The kids started school today. They are taking it  way  much better than  I  am. My 17 year old is on probation and under house arrest, so she is thrilled to just get out of the house. My 10 year old is one of those gifted/talented students, so  she's  back in business now . . . Me? I'm pissed that I have to get up and get them to school at an hour that I think even animals are not even yet stirring.    Speaking of G/T students . . . mine is typical. She approached me with what seemed like ream of paper saying that "these needs to be filled out by you tonight" at 10 fucking thirty-something at night! It's either a lack of common sense or that she's just too involved in her projects to remember. I think it's the latter . . . I think. Who knows.   Thank God tomorrow is Friday. Don't forget the Houston/Dallas game on Saturday. (Death to Dallas).

       Wait a minute . . . "Red" is a homeland security level. Scratch that. The point is: QT is now an official contributor to this blog and has full control of the dashboard to post as she feels inclined to do so. Instead of code red, think of it as you would a hurricane warning. I got confirmation this afternoon and I couldn't be happier. She will be a definite improvement to this blog.   Thanks QT !

            If I am lucky,  there may be a new member added to this blog.  I am not very optimistic about her having the time, energy or desire to write here, but at least the invitation was sent. If she  does  decide to write in whenever she has the time, I  promise  that it will be worth reading.         I have known her as QT for several years.  She's smarter, faster, meaner, wittier and tougher than anyone I know, including myself. She is  not  someone you would want to engage in a debate. Her humor and attitude are right-on,  and  it turns out she always seem to be right.         All I can do is wait and see if she writes in. I hope she does.

            That's right. Sunday sucks. Especially Sunday  night . You know how it is. Even though you are off, you can't really indulge in anything because you have to be at work in the morning,  on  the   day of total scrutinization (Monday). If your late, slow, not looking  your best, still wearing a coctail dress . . . it will be decided by all that you were on a drug and alcohol binge all weekend. People . . . pfft.

             I have nothing to say or talk about. Actually, I do, but it's all so negative even I don't want to get into it. I guess all I'm doing now is leaving a current post so this place doesn't look dead.
