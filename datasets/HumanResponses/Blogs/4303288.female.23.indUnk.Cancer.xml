      So I have a new dilemma.  Amanda finally got back into town and called me.  We went to a baseball game, which was fun in itself, but then we ended up at a party with these guys.  Some of them were in a band and I ended up talking to the base guitarist, Johnny, most of the night.  He was this really awesome guy, very intelligent and gentlemanly.  And a badass guitarist as well.  We kissed, and he didnt ask for anything more.  Turns out I really like this guy.  My dilemma is I dont know if Im ready.  I just got out of this horrid relationship with Ethan, and, actually, I know I'm not ready to get involved with someone else, but I really like this guy.  His band has a gig Wednesday night and he asked me to come.  I am going, absolutely, but I dont know what to think.  I really wish I could have met him a few months from now, when Ethan's out of my system.  Its not like Im insisting on getting in another serious relationship or anything; I dont know if Im ready to date again AT ALL.  I'll probably hold out on a decision until Wednesday, see what happens, if he disses me in favor of all those little groupies that wear tight miniskirts and giggle a lot.  If he doesnt, well, thats saying something... but I dont know what it'll mean to me.  Sigh.   Men are a lot of trouble.  Highlight of the day: Meeting Johnny Lowpoint of the day: Indecision  Mood: Confused

      Feeling kinda angry at the unfairness of the world. Here I am with enough guts to dump an abusive boyfriend, and yet I'm the one stuck lonely by myself on a weekend while he's out partying with his friends. He should be the one who's lonely. Every friend I had I shared with Ethan, so when we broke up, I'm left with 2 friends. Rachel cant go out b/c of her kid, and Amanda hasnt been home all weekend. So here I am, again, alone.  Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is lonely. God knows he cant keep friends around for too long. He's already pissed most of them off, mooching them dry like he did me. But I guess that's what I get for letting him do it. Even Amanda admitted he was a mooch, and she's known Ethan her whole life. You'd think I would have learned about users from Jay. Jay used me for nearly two years. I guess I just thought Ethan would be different, even though he and Jay are best friends. But at least Jay was never abusive, not like Ethan. Rachel says I have a bad habit of picking the same type of guy over and over, and I think she's on to something. I gotta watch out for guys like Ethan and Jay in the future.  I've been thinking that maybe our majors in college say a lot about us. I picked Psychology b/c I wanted to help people. Maybe I wanted to help myself, better understand myself. I know I'm not perfect, I know I cant be, but maybe I think I may learn why. Havent yet. Most of the bad things that happen to me, like Ethan, I invite into my life. There's probably something to that.  Its weird. Even though I'm so lonely I'm thinking of calling up people I havent talked to in years, I still feel a million times better than I did when Ethan was here. I am so glad he's gone. Too bad he left some of his stuff, and I'm too nice to burn it.  What an exciting life I lead. Staying at home alone on a weekend with only my cat, cleaning and playing some stupid computer games and watching TV. When I was younger I thought by the time I was 23 I'd have some great, exciting, exotic life. And yet here I am, recovering from an abusive relationship, no job, and I've lost nearly all of my friends.  I gotta quit with this self-pity stuff.  Highlight of the day: It rained! :) Lowpoint of the day: Not being able to get Ethan out of my head on a Saturday night  Mood: angry

      Registered for class yesterday.  First class toward my Masters in Clinical Psychology.  Taking Research Methodology.  Not exactly a fun class OR one I wanted to take but I dont really mind.  Its the first thing I felt excited about since Ethan destroyed my hope and my ambition.  I'm so glad he's gone.  It's like the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders, although my debt is bothering me right now.  Credit card bills are climbing b/c I dont have a job and cant find one to save my life.  My mom and dad are helping me out by giving me some money, but that's for rent and utilities.  Played Star Wars Galaxies a lot of today.  Just finished cleaning.  I'm trying to erase all sign of Ethan.  Why did I let him do what he did to me?  I'm supposed to be smarter than that.  At least, I thought I was.  Rachel suggested I start a journal to help me get past and recover from Ethan.  Sounded like a good idea.  Regretting sleeping with Thomas.  Completely unlike me to have a one night stand.  Ended up feeling more lonely and empty than before we had sex.  Smell of him on my sheets kept me awake last night, so they're in the wash.  Amanda neglected to tell me until after it was over that Thomas is a dealer.  Oh well, too late now.  I just hope I never hear from him again.  I hated the way he talked to me in bed.  Anderson just called.  I have him my number at the club but I'm not ready to start dating again.  I'm still recovering from Ethan.  Patrick called too.  I gotta quit giving out my number if I'm not sure about going out with the guy.  It helps though to have these guys call me.  Ethan had me so convinced I was ugly its nice to know at least someone disagrees.  I really should work on my novel.  I'm about three chapters from finishing it.  I cant believe Ive made it this far without giving up.  Its really turned out better than I thought it would hve.  Highlight of the day: Buying books for my class :) Lowpoint of the day: Being alone on a Friday night :(  Mood: lonely
