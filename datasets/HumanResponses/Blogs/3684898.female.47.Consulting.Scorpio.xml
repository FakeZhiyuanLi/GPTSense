       Maybe I have needed to do this for years.  I thought I was dealing pretty well with Sonya's death, after all it was 12 years ago today.  I got up this morning with a total sense of anxiety and depression.  I haven't been able to concentrate on much this entire week, certainly not on work, which is stupid because if I don't work, I don't get paid (the one downside to having my own business).  Anyway, I didn't realize until I started writing that this is the anniversary of her transition to some other life.  God, I miss that girl.  I miss our friendship.  I miss our Sunday Morning Marathons on the phone.  I miss having someone I can tell anything and everything to without fear of being judged or disliked.  I miss being able to call her up for any stupid reason and not feel that I am taking up her precious time.  She was my touchstone and I know that I was hers.  I still believe that last conversation with her was God's gift to me because we were able to say goodbye without knowing it.  We must have talked for six hours that night...we talked about how lucky we were that we grew up with each other (we were friends from the  first day of first grade until her death at 35) and wondered what kind of people we would have grown into had we not known each other or if we hadn't bonded over the goldfish tank in the first grade classroom.  Who else could we argue with and not have it affect the friendship, especially as adults?    We talked about me wanting to become a mom;  she talked me into adopting a baby and not waiting for that Mr. Right who might not exist;  we talked why we were 35 and still single, since we were such marvelous people (more on that another day!). We talked about the Juneteenth celebrations in Denver, where I was and Milwaukee, where she was and the silly reasons why weren't going. We talked about her escape from her relationship with B. Nathan...and I still think her sudden death was her only way of escaping that ridiculous, toxic affair.  We kept getting back to the fact that we were blessed, lucky, fortunate, to have had each other for so many years through so many things for all the right reasons.  I should have picked up on the flavor of the conversation.  Usually our marathons revolved around me advising her on her life, but this one was different.  She kept moving the conversation back to me and my wants, needs, dreams, ideas...unusual.  When we said goodbye at midnight, fussing at each other that we couldn't pay the phone bills, I remember feeling such a feeling of peace that I hadn't felt before..and haven't since.  At times, I've felt like I am floating through the universe along.  I don't think I have gotten completely "on track" in 12 years.  I haven't lived in a constant state of sadness and despair, but I have just felt like an amputee must feel.  You know you have a limb missing, but you learn to adjust.  You get accustomed to having a prosthetic limb, you learn to use it well, and mostly the rest of the world can't tell you have it...but sometimes, during those Sunday mornings when something in you wants to pick up the phone and be able to make that marathon phone call, the plastic arm can't do it...you're still an amputee.
