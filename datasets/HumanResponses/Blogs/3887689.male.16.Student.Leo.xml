      Might not be posting for a while, as I am heading back to my regular home where computers are not as widely available. I will probably be on hiatus from AIM and the message board as well.  But don't be sad. I will rise again.

      Thanks to  urlLink The Truth About George W.

      Two things of interest today (well, to me; to you, they will probably be totally uninteresting and you'll go back to listening to Hoobastank or whatever trendy homogenized crap you listen to, thereby eliminating me from having to think about you).  I. Minor thing first. My mom gave me her old MP3 player, and it's totally sweet. It holds 10 gigs, which is about 3,000 songs or so. Trying to figure out how the hell it works with no manual was tough, but me being the genius that I am, I did it in about a week. I'm uploading my Bjork albums to it as we speak. Having my entire album collection all in a box about the size of a camera totally kicks ass.  II. My friend Khalina lost her virginity yesterday. It kind of shocked me. You know how parents are always talking about how their kids grow up so fast? I feel the same way towards my friends. It seems only yesterday when me and my friends first learned the meaning of the word "clitoris". Now they're smoking, drinking, fucking. Sometimes I pine for the days of innocence, the days when I found fart jokes amusing. But then I realize that those days...kinda sucked, regardless of what people try to tell you. Your parents never let you do anything, you had to go to bed early, you enjoyed Barney. Yep, don't let anyone tell you that childhood is the best time of your life.  To Khalina: you're my best buddy, and may you enjoy many more fucks in the future.

      Two things provoked thoughts in me today:    I. Some guy made a porno flick. Why is this eventful? Well, apparently he is trying to convince people that porno is not the lowbrow entertainment that many dismiss it as, but rather, it is high art. When asked what his definition of art is, he replied, "Whatever an artist says is art." I didn't really agree with that, but I certainly couldn't come up with a better definition. I knew it was time to look in the online dictionary. And this is what I found:     art   1      urlLink      (  )     Pronunciation Key    (ärt)     n.      Human effort to imitate, supplement, alter, or counteract the work of nature.    My first thought was, as you might imagine, "What the fuck?". But then, thinking about it further, every form of art can fall under one of those categories. Imitation, certainly: paintings of flowers and animals, novels about life in the wild, aural recreations of places. Counteract definitely: there has always been a counter-culture element to art . Alter, maybe: I guess bizarre shit that people try to pass off as art would fall under this category. However, I still don't understand why he chose the word "supplement" among these. Perhaps one of you can help me out. But back to the original point, while I think this defines most art, I don't think it's a good definition.         2. The conscious production or arrangement of sounds, colors, forms, movements, or other elements in a manner that affects the sense of beauty, specifically the production of the beautiful in a graphic or plastic medium.    That seems like a much better definition to me. Only problem here is, I guess porn would fall under this definition, as much as I would hate to consider porn to be art. If you have a better definition for art, please leave a comment.    II. If you had asked me whether I believe in love at first sight a mere twelve hours ago, I would've laughed at you and probably have given you some shit like, "I believe in lust at first sight," or something to that effect. But something extremely bizarre happened to me today. I was at a restaurant, and the waitress came up and introduced herself...and I felt a weird sort of attraction to her. I don't know exactly if it was "love" per se, like the kind of love I feel for my beautiful girlfriend Sam, who I hope is not reading this right now. But it was a sort of feeling towards her where I wanted to meet her, talk to her, get to know her a little bit, become friends, and then screw her. But don't confuse this with lust, friends. I realize I just said I wanted to screw her, but not in a monkey love sort of way. More in a romantic, wine and flowers kind of way (boy, I sure hope Sam isn't reading this). I dunno. I can't really describe what I mean. Words can't really do justice to feelings.

      Today is a day for celebration, friends. You know why, of course. Today is a day for celebration because this is my (*loud horns blare, old man has heart attack due to unexpected blaring of loud horns*) 10TH ENTRY! True, the 10th entry really isn't that important of a milestone, but...well...fuck you! This is my blog, I can do whatever I want! So, in celebration of this, why don't we look back at some of the best moments in Jeff's Blog history. Remember that one where I dissed vegetarians? That was awesome! Oh! And that one where I talked about gay marriage! That was&nbsp;really cool. Oh! And the one where I was all like, "Goths are totally conformist." That ruled! Looking back on all this has brought the predicted salty tears of nostalgia to come forth. I love you guys. Even George Bush, vegetarians, and goths. Hooray for people! No matter how stupid you may seem at times, you surprise me again and again.

      This post is mainly here as a reminder to myself that Yeah Yeah Yeahs will be on Craig Kilbourn on Wednesday. I don't know how they're gonna&nbsp;pull off "Maps" live, because it has three guitar parts, each one integral to&nbsp;the song,&nbsp;and the band only has one guitarist. But if I can remember to watch on Wednesday, my curiosity will be satisfied. On a similar note, Sonic Youth&nbsp;was&nbsp;on there today,&nbsp;and&nbsp;their new song sounded&nbsp;great, which surprised me, as Sonic Youth is one of those bands whose critical acclaim has always bewildered me. Maybe I'll pick up their new album.

      I forgot to mention that I saw two movies yesterday.  The Virgin Suicides , which was pretty good, and  Secret Window , which was not.  Secret Window  was okay actually, but the ending disappointed me immensely. (Spoiler ahead) The whole split personality thing is starting to get really old. It caught me totally off-guard when they did it in  Fight Club , but I've seen it in five movies since that I could name. Of course, the story  Secret Window  was based on came out before  Fight Club,  but regardless. Despite all that, Johnny Depp, truly one of the great actors of this era, turns in a good performance as usual.  The Virgin Suicides  was pretty good, a captivating story wrapped in layers of mystery (ain't no one rockin' these metaphors like I does). I recommend it.

      Some of my friends have alerted me that on this blog, I come off as vicious and spiteful&nbsp;when attacking things that annoy me. And looking back through the entries, I realized that I am fairly mean when it comes to that sort of thing. I'm not like that in person. Really. I swear. I only bring this up because I'm about to do it again. This time, the target will be: my friends! Well, not my friends in particular, but the "clique" my friends (and me by association, I regretfully suppose) belong to: the pseudo-goths. You know the type: the kind that think they're really cool and rebellious because they wear black, when in reality it just makes them look stupid? Those kind. To their credit, my friends aren't so much like that now as they were a year ago or so. But there's a new wave of them coming in to my school every year and  they need to be stopped . Now don't get me wrong, I&nbsp;definitely believe in the expression of individuality. But that's just the thing. The pseudo-goths are not individual in any way. They're just as much a flock of sheep as the "preps" that they try to separate themselves from. They all wear black. They all shop at Hot Topic. They all wear chains. They all listen to the same music (emo and metal). And they all hate the "preps". Why do they hate the preps? They don't have a good reason for it, other than those were the kids that picked on them in middle school. And I hated them too, in middle school. But you know what? We've all grown up. And I've discovered that a lot of the people I dismissed as "preps" are actually pretty cool.&nbsp;Changing the subject (kind of),&nbsp;I just realized that anyone out of high school won't be able to relate to this post. Well, whatever. This post isn't for you. This post is for the people I just described. As heartbreaking as it may be for you to hear, you are not a nonconformist. You are even more of a conformist than the people you label as conformists. Quit dressing like you were struck by a brain hemorrhage while you were picking out your clothes, and quit trying so hard to stand out. If you just act like yourself,  you will stand out.

      Today, in an effort to improve your music taste, which is definitely not as good as mine, I will provide a list of albums that everyone should be required by federal law to own. NOTE: If you want to look into these bands, in most cases the below albums are not the best place to start (I have included those). However, they are what I believe to be each band's best work.     1. Pixies -  Trompe le Monde   Pixies are the greatest band ever in the history of the universe. Nirvana, Radiohead, and Weezer have all admitted to ripping them off. They are the wellspring from whence alternative rock sprung. Catchy pop and headache-inducing noise coexist in beautiful peace, forming one of the greatest albums of all time. Start with  Doolittle , though.     2. Pavement -  Wowee Zowee   This one is a grower. You will definitely not like it the first time you listen to it. It feels messy (with eighteen songs that all sound totally different, it's bound to), fractured (a lot of the songs sound incomplete), and sometimes downright amelodic (mostly because of Stephen Malkmus's voice, which sounds as though he's bored out of his mind). But don't give up.  Keep listening . Soon, the genius of this album will hit you. You will realize the songs' true beauty. And you will love this album every bit as much as I do.  Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain  is a better place to start though.     3. Radiohead -  Kid A   Boy, were people mad when this one came out. It was a total reformation of their sound. Their sound barely even qualified as rock anymore, as they were now almost pure electronica. And it was tough to wrap your mind around, with it's unconventional sounds and song structures. But regardless of all that, the music contained herein possesses an icy sort of beauty that is unmatched by any other band. But get  OK Computer  first.    4. Weezer -  Weezer (Blue Album)   This album blew my fucking mind. I had previously dismissed Weezer as typical rock radio fodder due to their terrible hit single "Hash Pipe". And you know what? At the time I was right.  The Green Album , which contained "Hash Pipe", was pure garbage. But a friend told me I should check out their older stuff. And so, I bought a used copy of  Pinkerton . And I liked it. It was good, catchy pop. But it in no way prepared me for the  Blue Album . Rivers Cuomo has a gift for melody like no one else. This album is sweet pop perfection. Every song on here is stunning, and my only wish is that it could be longer (than its scant ten songs in forty-one minutes).      5. The Roots -  Things Fall Apart   Obviously, this won't appeal to you unless you like hip-hop, but for those of you that do, this album is essential. Black Thought and Malik B. are undefeated in terms of lyrical prowess, and the music, which I can only describe as psychedelic jazz, is great. The Roots are truly innovative here, pushing the boundaries of rap music, which they did even more so on the also-recommended  Phrenology . However, I feel this album is better than  Phrenology  due to it's lack of terrible songs like  Phrenology 's "Break You Off".     Honorable Mentions  ------------------------  Neutral Milk Hotel - In the Aeroplane Over the Sea  Beastie Boys - Hello Nasty  OutKast - Stankonia  Beck - Odelay  The Shins - Chutes Too Narrow  Modest Mouse - The Lonesome Crowded West  Bjork - Homogenic  Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Ween - Chocolate and Cheese  The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots

      Just a quick update: got a message board up and running now. Obviously, no one's posted yet, because I just got it up and running, but hopefully the people reading this blog (both of you) can fix that. So if you have the time, come register for  urlLink my board .

      I hate Bush. I realize it's become trendy to hate Bush and all, but as much as I dislike following trends, I hate Bush. There are a multitude of reasons for why I hate Bush, but I'm just gonna stick with one for this entry, and that's gay marriage. Now, it doesn't bother me so much that Mr. Bush is opposed to gay marriage. Everyone has their opinion on how things should be and I respect his. However, I think he is despicable for trying to make an amendment to ban it. Am I the only person in the world who finds this utterly ridiculous? A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT?! Does this seem kind of un-American to anyone? This is America, the land of the free! Unless you're black, gay, or Indian of course, but that goes without saying. I don't know what kind of ridiculous shit the conservatives are trying to justify this with. Religious values would be my first guess. But then, we have just a teensy problem with that, a little law passed a while back that had something in it about "seperation of church and state". Perhaps you've heard of it. Or maybe, as my stepmother frequently tries to tell me, the argument is "to protect the sanctity of marriage". RIGHT. To protect the sanctity of marriage. Seems like a valid reason. But if we're trying to protect the sanctity of marriage, why stop at gayness? I say we should have a constitutional amendment banning adultery. And anyone who breaks this will receive no less than the death penalty. Because god damn it, this is America, the home of the free! And why even stop there? I say we ban divorce. Hope you like your wife, because she's all you're getting for the rest of your life! Let freedom RING! WOOHOO! Well, that's enough of that. Hope you enjoyed this one. I know you've heard a million times about how much of an asshole Bush is, but here in America we can all throw our two cents in, and that's what I opted to do. Good day to you.

      You know what I don't get? Vegetarians. I mean, maybe I could understand if you don't eat meat for health reasons, or even religious reasons. But if you do it because you think it's wrong to eat animals, then I got three words for ya, pal: "IT'S FUCKING NATURE!". Animals eat other animals to survive. That's how nature worked, works, and always will work. And if you think you're somehow reducing the suffering of animals by not eating meat, you are wrong again, because if you don't eat it, it's just gonna grow old, suffer, and die anyway. Who are you to defy nature, you self-righteous fucks? Think you're so goddamn moral because you don't eat animals. I'll kill you!

      You know what I've been doing all day? Playing games on the internet. And when I say all day, I literally mean all day. As soon as I woke up, I logged onto Uproar and started playing Acrophobia. And from there, I've been hopping to other games on other sites. Hearts, Family Feud, Strike a Match, Password. I can't help it man, this shit is fun! If you've ever played Acrophobia, you know that it possesses addictive qualities similar to heroin. They give you a series of letters, you make an acronym out of them, everybody votes on which one is the best, and the one with the most is the winner of the round. And when you start, there's no stopping, at least for the next few hours. If you would like to play,   urlLink here's the link . As you've no doubt guessed by now, my life is not very interesting.

      My first post on my first blog. I can nearly feel the salty tears of future nostalgia stream down my face and enter my mouth, causing me to spit them out on my wall, which then crumbles because of the moisture. It's been an interesting (by which I mean "not interesting") summer. I am currently at my mom's house in Michigan, several hundred miles away from my home state of North Carolina. But let me assure you folks, nothing is too far away from the hellish pit that some people refer to as my home. Boy, do I hate that place. But enough of my ranting. You probably want to know some stuff about me. First of all, I'm a teenager. I'm a pretty nice guy, if I say so myself. I am, however, fairly pessimistic. I believe that the majority of the human race are morons, with my fellow teenagers being the main culprits.&nbsp;Seriously, the&nbsp;actions and attitudes of my peers disgust me. As far as hobbies go, my main one would be music. I love indie rock and IDM, but most of all, I love to play guitar. I'm a good guitarist, but sadly, I'm not very creative. But as I'm playing more, I find that more and more cool riffs are coming to me. As soon as I can scrape together a song, you guys will be the first to hear it. Well, that's enough for now. Next time I post, I'll try to make it more interesting.
