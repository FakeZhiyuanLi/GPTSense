      This is a very old dream.  I believe I had this dream oh.... back in '92.  So that would make me around 12.  This dream, was disturbing, for me.  Basically, it's about clones... of one of my sister.  In the dream now, my mother was taking me to school along with my eldest sister (still younger than me) when all of the sudden I also saw her walking to school on the side of the road.  I got excited and exclaimed to my mom and sister what I saw, they were baffled.  I hopped out of my car and chased after my other sister, but when I was about to get to her I saw another one coming out of a store from across the street and another further along the street, in fact I saw a clear line of my sisters walking away from some place in the distance...  So I went and followed this odd path with my sister(s) trying to get my attention and distract me, but I was persistent and I found them all coming out of a factory!  I sneaked into the factory and overheard, what appeared to me, a mad scientist shouting about how he is going to rule the world by overpopulating it with clones of my sister!  I woke up then, as you realize, at my age, this was a nightmare and I still remember the dream.  Scarry huh?

      The title almost says it all.  This is a bizarre dream about an innocent gathering of friends to watch a movie.   It starts when my best friends invite me to watch a movie over at a house they are house sitting for, they only are house sitting in the dream not in real life, I have never seen this house before.  They also invite some of their other friends and its a cool gathering, except there is a vital problem with the bathroom at this place.  For some reason the bathroom only functions by urinating in this dirty cooking pot, the pot is unwashed from last being used for some kind of pasta.  Oh, but it gets worst, for some reason my foot is stuck in this pot, and everyone has to use the bathroom!  Between the inconvient "bathroom breaks" we watch a movie about mice.  The movie starts with the mice discovering all "life" from the world is gone and they now rule it.  They build their society until quite unexpectedly it is ended by the return of the previous lifeforms of the world.  At the end of the movie you find out that this is a NIGHTLY occurence during the hours of which the lifeforms (humans) go to bed, and the world is a couple of rooms in a house.   There was also something about Maniac Mansion about this dream, but I don't remember what.. I just get the impression.  The memories of the dream fade me, thank goodness, but I wish I could remember more about the movie!

      I have the ability to remember many dreams a night, or sometimes one long continuous dream.  I think that I should start keeping a dream journal to document all my weird and frightful dreams while they are fresh on my mind.

      This isn't really about a particular dream this time.  This about a certain dream state that I find myself in maybe once every three months.  This is a state where you can only dream about one thing OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  This is probably my least favorite state of all, because usually, like this morning, I force myself to stay awake instead of going back to sleep to have the same dream for the fiftyth time just to wake up a couple minutes later.  Rinse, Dry, Repeat.  This usually happens to me when I do something in excess.  Usually that something is thought intensive like programming, Database design, or a strategy or adventure game.  Then the dream is about some problem that I am having in that area and I can not solve it in my dream, I wake up and when I close my eyes again I am almost instantly greated again with the same, or a variotion of the problem.   The only time I have ever been able to sleep again restfully is if I analyise my dream and find a solution to the problem.  Most of the time though the problem in my dream is abstract I can not think of any answer to the dream that will provide a resolution to the conflict in the dream.  Usually what I have to do is get whatever I have been doing out of my system by finishing it or exhausting myself so much that my nights are dreamless.  I've tried getting up for a while and waking myself up, drinking water, reading, taking my mind off of the matter, but nothing helps.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Does anyone else have a solution that works for them so they can get back to bed in short order?

      All right, this dream wasn't primarily about baseball at all.. like most dreams the events do not make to much sense.  It was more like watching a movie for most of the time.  Basically it started off with this family, a man and his wife and a child (young girl).  The man was a baseball player, for what team I don't know, and I don't know what position he played either.  This man, was a kind man but NO ONE liked him, he was clumsy and could not play baseball well anymore.  His team mates would always play pranks on him and these pranks would often make him delayed in coming home to his family.  So his wife was not to pleased with him either.  His wife was pretty, still young, bright blue eyes and dark blonde hair.  Then there was me, I came in on the seen and I was not unlike this other man, but I was confident and I was very kind and I was very helpful.  I helped the wife get things done that she needed to do, I was supportive to her daughter, and I was a good friend to her husband and helped him out of the pranks that were put forth to him.  One day though three things happened... His wife told me that she fell in love with me, and I told her that the feelings were mutual... the man's work called and told me they were going to fire him and wanted me to take his place.. and on my way to the baseball field I found the man, and another prank was being pulled...  He was buried up to his neck in grungy dirt.  I fought of the guys that were guarding him and went to find a shovel to dig him out, but then another guy came and used a hose to make the guy neck deep in mud.  At the moment I "lost" the shovel and I always found another excuse not to find the shovel or find to did the guy out.  Hmmmmm.... so I am not really going to analyze this until after work.  I'll put it in my comments... I have some interesting ideas about what this dream means to me.  Feel free to comment.

      This dream is another "classic" that I had oh.... in '96 when I was 16. I call it the waking number dream. It happened after the first time I stayed awake for over 24 hours.  As you can imagine I was extremely tired after staying awake so long. I was at home and sitting in the family room on the couch when I just crashed and fell asleep... and then the dream begun.  It wasn't unusual at all except for the small fact everyone in my dream spOKe in numbers. It was ok though, because I could understand and communicate with them with a simple algorithm I could do in my head. It was cool. Except, then my dad woke me up in the waking world.....  I woke up, and I WAS awake I am sure of it. Except one problem, whatever my dad was saying, I could only hear it numbers! The worst part about it was I forgot the algorithm oh that and I was hearing him speak numbers in the first place.... Apparently he wanted me to do something because he started yelling at me when I just kept staring at him trying to figure out if I was awake or not! So I left the family room and went to find something else to do. Fortunately after a couple minutes the numbers started turning into words again and every few words there would only be a few numbers, until everything was back to normal again.  My dream actually crossed over into the waking rule for a substantial period of time!  The mind is amazing isn't it?

      It maybe cliche, but life is just full of changes. Is change good? I like getting change when I pay for something... but can change only come from paying something, exchanging it for something of value.. for something that less? Yes that was a little abstract, but sometimes it feels like that, that you give up to much of yourself to change into something else. The potential of the change could be large though, but it could be a dud and come short and you lose more than you gain.  I have had a recent experience of that sort of nature. It is highly personal, and not something that I want to post publicly, but it has stimulated some random thoughts.  I didn't really think certain... feelings or desires could be changed. However, they have. The change was catalyzed by putting myself back into the situation that invokes certain attitudes and responses that I was sure were unchangeable. I guess not, and I guess it wasn't so much a radical change as an evolution of an understanding of my own motivations for my feelings. The stimuli for my previous motivations were removed, and that stimuli was NEVER in my control. That stimuli, sad but true, was at its basic, was hope. Now do not worry, I am not talking about hope in life or anything like that.. just in one thing that was important.  You know what, it was not so traumatic to lose that hope as I thought. It is.... peaceful. I feel a little empty, but now I can move on from something that was holding me back from evolving into a different direction. Not worst, I don't know if better, but different.. change... is change good?

      Well, can you believe how much of nothing we can say through out a day?  We can convey feelings, dodge questions, inspire confidence by saying a few words... words that don't convey any meaning at all.      What is really amazing that this would not be possible without our own self dilusions and petty assumptions we make.       Sometimes it is nice to "chew the fat", but it amazes how some people can chew it all day.  Of course you know, when you chew the fat, you get a fat head.   It is amazing the amount of useless, unimportant, trival, and other synonyms amount of stuff one can recall and recite and amuse any standard wall with.  There is no room left for cognitive process, it would be a dangerous place if a lot more people had something to think about and were motivated by their thoughts.    Hmmm... I would be scared if I ever was motivated to act upon my thoughts ;)   How about you?

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question, how do you judge yourself?&nbsp; What is your self esteem based on?&nbsp; What could be removed (or added) to your life that would instantly change the image you have for yourself?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me what is important is that I keep changing for the better.&nbsp; Better is defined as what makes me feel more fullfilled in my own life.&nbsp; So when I feel like I am stagnet I feel depressed and have love self worth.&nbsp; When I am accomplishing personal goals I feel good and my selfworth raises.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think that a large part of my selfworth comes from the knowledge that I am important to others.&nbsp; I don't think my life truely has meaning if it doesn't have an impact on other's lives.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is a fault or not, at times it serves and at times it destroys my own self moral.&nbsp; Go figure.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I think the worst thing that could happen to me is that I find myself letting everyone I know down and have no direction in life.&nbsp; That has not happened yet.....&nbsp; Will it?&nbsp; Not while I still care about living.

      Is your computer your best friend, maybe your worst enemy, or maybe just an acquaintance?&nbsp; For me they are my job.&nbsp; Repairing computers can be exhausting.&nbsp; Forgive the personifications, but they are like people in that they each have their own quarks and need different things.&nbsp; Most of them could deal with much more displine, need a change in the way they think (Operating System, Software), and patience as well.&nbsp;   For instance, I'm fixing several computers at the moment at work.... and I'm waiting for them ALL to finish some kind of scan or installation...&nbsp; My patience is running short, I don't like sitting here doing nothing waiting for them to finish.&nbsp; So I blogged this random thought.&nbsp; *Blah*

          "The most depraved type of human being ... (is) the man without a purpose." Ayn Rand in "Atlas Shrugged"   This is a quote from a book I have been reading. I am only a tenth of the way into the book right now (pg 150 /~1300pg) It is a very interesting book. So far it is about a future where man's philosophy is that everything should only be done for the good of those that are not as fortunate. To be more concise it is corrupt to produce for your own gain and value only comes from the sacrifice of your own wealth and ability to benefit those who do not have it. This is not the point of the book, the point of the book as far as I can see so far is to show exactly the opposite.  Now for the quote. I have been thinking on my own for some time along the same lines as the quote above. I do agree with the quote, mostly. However, I think that there is one level higher of depravity. That is: If a man has a purpose but does not take any action toward fulfilling that purpose, then this is the most depraved type of human being.    Perhaps I am splitting hairs and that the original quote implies this. However, just because someone has a purpose does not mean they will choose to attempt to fulfill it. Also, just because someone has a purpose does not meant they know what it is. Purpose needs a clearer definition. The book actually clarifies that definition of purpose partly by this quote:          "There's nothing of any importance except how well you do your work."           This implies that the purpose of man is work, because that it is the most import thing that you (assuming) work and do it well. What type of work, that seems to be up to the individual. The views in this book are extreme of course. I do agree that the definition of purpose must imply that it is not just a goal, but a continues state to be obtained and maintained. However, my point remains that even if you know, in the extreme case, that your only purpose is to do a job (even if it is chosen by you) and do it well, does not mean someone will want to, or will. Someone can simply lack the motivation and drive to accomplish their purpose. THIS I think is the greater problem then finding a purpose. Purpose is easy to find, it is taking action toward the fulfillment of purpose that people find difficult. There is always some action to be take to take toward a purpose. If you cannot find a way to immediately fulfill your purpose you must find out what goals you must meet first so you will have opportunity to fulfill your purpose. The point, there is a constant action, there is momentum that must happen. If someone cannot even find the motivation to define what purpose is important in their life then that lack motivation is the greatest deprivation they can have.  Comments?

      Well, I haven't mentioned it, but I really desire a Gmail account. Why? Just so I can give it a spin, and assure myself of my account name! So, there is this place  urlLink Gmail Swap , that lets you post what you will trade for a gmail invite. Well I've posted SEVERAL times, the first time I offered to help with computer problems(no responses), second a six digit ICQ# I own (some responses no takers), third the ICQ# again just so I can see if I could get someone to bite (nope, just responses again but people are to afraid of being hussled), and lastly.... a promise to send them a copy of The Ultimate Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Dogulas Adams. Gold Dirt! Who can say no to that? So far I have had two offers  Update: I had a total of four takers

      Well, I just got off the phone with my mom. She gave me some rather.. new information to assimilate. First you must know my parents divorced about 15-18 months ago. I am now 24, so my parents divorcing so late in my life came to a real shock, it is like the sky not being blue on a clear sunny day.  Both of my parents now are "involved" with someone else. Both situations have there own fantastic stories, however it is not my place to publish either of those stories, it is their business. However I worry for both of them, there is no way for me to truly understand each situation especially when I am now 3000 miles away from home. However it comes as a shock, it seems like they both are moving quickly in their relationships. For reasons I won't discuss here, I am not sure that is so wise!  But who am I kidding.. I am still single, I don't want to be, I feel like I have most of my life left still and I still have the strong urge to find someone else.. quickly. The worst part is I don't, but my parents are better at the field then I am! How humiliating, don't you think?

       Perhaps it's just me, but have job requirements been highly inflated? I mean, really, there are jobs out there requiring 10 years of experience on like the .NET platform. Give me a break! It has not been out that long.    I feel like when I go apply for a job that I don't even have the credentials for them to take my request serious. They should, I have the skills, I have the degree, just not the "professional" experience. Are there people out there actually applying and putting down just as absurd experience as being demanded? ARGH!
