Then I got on here n Jess Imed me and was like Can I tell you somethin without you getting mad. I was like wat. and she told me that basically Justin was cheating on me and that there was a girl who he had on the sidelines to replace me when we broke up. I started crying. GoD! I never wanna lose this kid I love him so incredibly much. I was really upset so I talked to Blake a lil bit and helped a bit..I love that kid so much. Its like me n him have such a past that hes soo easy to talk to. I couldnt see myself w/o him as a friend. Then Meg called me and shes havin probs w/ Matt.. so we talked bout how much harder love is than we thought it would ever be.. so yeah.. I love her so much. Shes like my best friend ever and helped me a bunch.. and then I got online and Marie was on and she made me realize I shouldnt do anything too dumm. I love her.. she makes me realize a buncha junk..

      My summer so far has been actually been filled with money n much boredom which results n sleep.. lol.   yesterday..  we walked down to the pool n I realized Nathan had left the key on the counter so we hada trek it all the way back n Im talkin like 1/2 mile round trip.. lol.. n it was hott. lol but we got home n I was like screw this whole swimmin thing n then Lyndsey called n shes like NO! ur gonna walk ur ass up here.. so I got Nathan ready again n then we went back up.. so we were there from like 12 - 2.. But OMGSSH!! while we were up there there was a TON of black kids n their moms swimmin n bein loud as most nuggets are n this lady who lives across teh street was like can I see yalls tag.. which u have to have to swim up there so people that dont pay dont swim.. n they started sayin  how it was discrimination n how they get picked on everytime while tehy are down there.. well hm yes. u will wen u have halfa africa down there... so they started yellin at each other n Nathan was like swimmin over there n I was like come back kid. n then he decided he wanted to go.. n me n lyndsey were like hush.. were stayin to listen to this.. so that went on for like 20 min.. but yea.. it was such excitement! So we came back here n cleaned up n I got ready to babysit.. Then at like 6 Wayne showed up and I went up to my moms work n talked to some of the chics up there n her boss was like gosh ashley u make me want a daughter.. n my mom was like shes for rent.. *gasp*.. but yea.. Taras really cool n her kids really like me.. shes got a 2 year old n a 4 year old.. They are one pretty black family.. lol. So we left there at like 645 n drove to where I was sposed to babysit.. n I did till like 1130.. They want me to baby sit their 4 girls for mosta the summer so she can work.. moneys kinda tight for them.. so I said I wouldnt mind.. I mean she said I could take the baby wen the other kids are w/ their dads for the weekend w/ me n go do w/e. n Sophies a really good baby n shes sooo cute.. so I might just do that since me n Justin usually hang out on weekends .. so im not sure.. well see.  Today..  I woke up n did NOTHIN... I have sat here n done NOTHIN! Its been sooo borin... Ive talked to Justin a lil bit but other tahn that its been mainly me n my brother.. cuz he decided to fall asleep wen Michelle was comin over w/ her kids so we couldnt go up to the pool.. oh well.. Im kinda burned from yesterday.. So we decided to just got tomorrow.  Well. Im like listenin to Kenny Chesney. when I think bout Leavin.. yeah.. strikes a lil too close to home. Its like sometimes I wonder wat would happend if I ever left him wen he does somethin stupid that annoys me like loses his licenese.. but then I think bout how much I would be losin.. an awesome guy whos totally in love w/ me.. his family is AWESOME... Gosh. I love his lil sister so much.. shes like my own lil sister.. His moms not bad either.. I kno they have a strong past but I wouldnt mind chillin w/ her a lil more.. she seems really cool... like she got all pumped up bout prom n she likes to make stuff for me.. Its acutally really sweet n Justins like weird round her so Im not sure. I would actually like to see em to be closer cuz it is his mom.. the one who brought him nto the world. I mean sure she might not have been the greatest mom.. sure she mighta been a whore.. but she loved him enough to take care of him wen she was only 18. so who knos.. but Ima go clean up my room.. so Ill catch yall crazy fools later.. mwah!

      The angels sang a whiskey lullaby  GAH.. thats the saddest song...  So now I try to give more than I take n I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say its my way or no way at all n now I cherish love a whole lot more cuz of whats n the back of the bottom drawer  Dawg. That song just makes u member how life has changed you for the way your livin today.. Like in the song talkin bout past relationships.. I just dont wanna make the same mistakes I made w/ all the others cuz Justins definately the best chance I have ever recieved..  It was the summer n time was n a hurry And we couldnt grow up fast enough And n the back seat of ur car I gave u more than just my heart n we swore that it was love  This song makes me doubt everything. Its like this song talks bout movin all fast n thats exactly wat me n Justin did.   I guess theres just a part of me that likes to bring u down just to keep you around, cuz the day u that u realize how amazin u are ure gonna leave me  God. Everyday I fall deeper n love w/ him n Im soo scared that hes gonna find a better girl cuz he could def get better cuz hes like the perfect boyfriend.. sure he has his flaws.. but I dont care.. I love him soo much!!  yea.. dont ask... all those songs were n my profile n I wanted to replace my profile but I didnt wanna lose em..

Hes the most incredible person.. n even tho ppl say he only wants some since hes now outta high skool n I be just a junia! aww.. I love the sounda that.. but I dont care. people are gonna talk.. n from now on they can just talk bout how I love him..    Sure.. I might be known as a whore by some.. bitch by others.. but as long as I have my friends who really kno the real me.. it dont really matter.. cuz I have everything that means anything at all to me.

Im not one to cry durin sex so he knew somethin was up.. n then I was like I wanta change. n hes like are we breakin up.. n basically I hada tell him that I loved him w/ all my heart n junk like that. God I love taht kid more than life itself. I swear him and Megan are like the most important people n my life. They are like my bestest friends EVER! but about her.. she cheated on Matt.. how sads that? I kinda feel bad for that kid but at the same time if he was bein a decent bf she wouldnt have to go out w/ other guys.. so idk. Im just glad she didnt go farther than makin out w/ Josh cuz shes slept w/ that kid PLENTY of times.. so yeah. guess shes lucky nothin more happened. Well I gotz to clean up my room so I can go w/ my baby tonite! mwahz!

      I hada wake up at like 5.45 to go to work w/ my mom cuz she hada work from 7 ~ 6... so yah. so I went up there n played w/ the youngins till bout 9 n then Wayne picked me up n drove me to work.. n so that went on fairly uneventful.. n then after that I went  back to my moms work and played w/ some more kids.. There was this one baby well shes like around a year n shes a really cute n shes a foster kid n shes been n like 6 homes so far.. shes a really cute black baby. I never thought I would ever say that.. lol. but turns out that her foster mom practically gives her no attention so I held her from like 2 till 5.30. I would try n give her to my mom but shed scream so Id just carry her around.. n then when she saw her mom she started screamin.. That was the saddest thing.. to kno that the lil baby was dreadin it. but shes gonna be back tomorrow but the thing is Im not.. cuz I was sposed to go w/ my mom again but Justin wants me to go with him n his sister n the resta the gang  cuz its her b~day.. so yah. But I really hope that baby finds a good home cuz shes an adorable thing! But yah. I needa find my wallet.. lol.. its got like 300 bux in it.. so Ill catchya later. mwah! bye!

But I gotta chill w/ all them.. Its rather funny.. his grandfather was like go ask ur wife for money insteada me.. n his dad is like talkin bout buildin me and Justin a house. His lil sister is set on us gettin married.. and I love the fact that his whole family is talkin that way too. I mean yah its kinda scary n an aspect but in another its like they can see me n the picture for a LONG time ago. so yah.. Then we were drivin home last night and his lil sister hada go to the bathroom so I ran her into the bathroom and his dad was like yah the kids really love you. besides Dana ( this chic who was like almost their step mom ) your like the female they talk about the most.. That itself meant so much. Its like not only do I have Justins love but I got his whole familys. I LOVE THEM SOO MUCH! hell Kasey gave me this ring she won at an arcade n I wear it on my right hand and Justins promise ring on my left.. and like I told him tonite.. my wearing of the rings should show him Im not only dedicated to him but his family as well.. OH well. no sense in ramblin on n on about my love for him.. cuz I love him soo much! but yah.. anyways. hes been my life pretty much for the past week.. but I gotta work tomorrow from like 9-2 and then I gotta babysit from like 6:30 till like 11. But its just the baby so that wont be any problem. Shes like 6 months n goes to sleep at like 7 so yah. But anywho.. I talked to Blake tonight and hes not havin any luck w/ the girls.. which really makes me sad.. I love that kid so much more than hell ever kno.. hes an amazin guy.. hell hes the 1st guy I fell in love w/ and hes made me realize so many more things about myself than anyone else.. oh well.. he was my 1st kiss n 1st love but now Im madly in love w/ Justin. but speakin of Justin Ima call him cuz for the past few minutes Ive been callin myself w/ the 404 area code. lol yeah Im blonde. lol well Justins confusin me n Im tired so good night! mwah!
