      It was a good Halloween. Much better than last year. Much different than last year too but very good.    The first week of work ended uneventfully, the way it should have.  I'm glad the rain is here but it definitely means I needs more winter clothes!  Shopping! Well, not yet but soon.

      Spam mail.  In a big way.  Especially when it is disguised as mail that I might actually want.  For example "Per our chat last night", "Hi", "Job leads", etc.  I got one this afternoon from a site that supposedly someone has information about available.  But I can't find out what the information is unless I pay for it.  Now I ask you, if the information were valid, which I doubt this is, wouldn't I know it already?  If this information were about me and truthful, wouldn't I, being me, know what it says?  Why would I need to pay for it? And to make it more obscure, the information is only listed by an email address I use for resumes.  Not by name, or a more often used email but by one used for job hunting.    Just another example of the many. many scams on the net.  So yeah, I am a tad irked by it.    In other areas, work is still good.  Life is still good.  45 minutes til the weekend starts!

      I like coming back from lunch to find that they all locked themselves out of their accounts.  It gives me phone calls to take that are relatively simple and easy to fix in nature.   Work is good, slow Friday, but good.  Happy Halloween everyone!

      Things here are so slow I almost want to fight over the phone calls!  I can't surf any more sites.  I check my email  all  the time and frankly I have thought about redesigning the company website.  So yeah, there ya have it.  I'm bored.  Oh I love the work, love the group of people I work with, I just wish there was more of a workload.  :)  Its a nice feeling.

      I just realized something this morning.  Since my life has gotten steered back in the right direction, readers have dropped.  Now while I have never really cared about the number of readers, I do find it interesting that when the drama subsides, and I stop whining that people stop reading.    It must be really hard to only want to see the bad things in people's lives instead of wanting to celebrate the good stuff with them too.

      Day 4 and counting.  I am  so  looking forward to sleeping in on Saturday. The phone is gonna be turned off tomorrow night, the drapes drawn and if Freedom wants to stay he is gonna have to snooze with me.  Although I doubt that will be a problem.  I have thrown the poor boy into a tizzy this week with getting up so early.   I'm trying to find that balance between all work and no play and all play and no work.  I'm hoping that once my body settles into the routine, the mind will follow. I've been eating a lot healthier this week and somehow I think that is making it worse.  *sigh*  I know.... its a process.

      *snort*  I just broke my desk.  Well not the whole thing but the lil drawer in the front.  My chair arm caught it and ripped off the front panel.  So I fixed it.  With clear packing tape.  Always the resourceful tech girl am I.

      Work is good.  I am really enjoying being back in the computer field and all of my fears were for nothing.  Once again, those around me were right and I was wrong.  :)  Gee, like that is an uncommon occurrence! Things are good though, I am just having a really hard time getting into this being awake at the butt crack of dawn thing!

      And right now that beholder is me! The call volume is just too low to keep this girl active.  So talk to me!  I can be reached through any variety of chat programs (AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, MSN) Leave me your user name, who you are and why you want to talk and I'll add you!

      Well its 11 somewhere in the world right now.  And there is simply no way I am going to be awake at 11 my time tonight. The day was good.  I am just so not used to getting up so dang early!    I do like the job though.  I like the guys I work with.  Eventually I will like the schedule.  The only thing I don't like is that my loafing time has been seriously cut in to!  :)    Basically though, I'm a happy camper.

      Funny story of the day...  Ju and I went to walk at McKinley Park this evening after work.  Naturally, Freedom came with us.  Well, he was amped up and hyper as all get out when we first set out.  So being the oaf that he is, he can't figure out what side to walk on or which path or even how to walk in a straight line.  There is a raised concrete border around the dirt path, its probably 4- 6 inches tall, maybe 4 inches wide.  My boy, goofball that he is, kept jumping and walking on alternate sides of it.  2 or 3 steps on the right of it, 2 or 3 steps on the left of it.  When that got boring he even managed a few steps on this border like a little kid.  Oh how I wished for a video camera.    That dog is the biggest gift I will ever get in my life.

      So the first day went well.  As usual, I was afraid for nothing.  None of the things I was scared of happened.  I wasn't and am not 100% comfortable there yet but com'on its only been 1 day. My schedule is gonna be 7:30-4:30 M-F.  Its kinda nice its makes it so I miss a lil of the rush hour traffic.  It took almost an hour to get home tonight for what is usually a 20 minute drive.  With going in earlier it'll probably only take a half hour.  I'm taking  urlLink this picture  with me tomorrow to put on my desk.  I am the only female there and the guys are really really nice, its kinda fun to be treated like one of the guys.  And I have the whole 2 stall bathroom to myself!  :D

      I get to go to work tomorrow. Yes, get is the correct word. See, when you have never been laid off, never been too sick to work, never stayed home day after day, you think work is a right. Its like its something you have to do and you are entitled to do it. After being home for so long, after all the lay-offs... I  get  to go to work tomorrow. The day might suck. I might fail 100%. I may even hate what I'm doing. But really... those are the worse things that can happen right? They can't take away my car, my dog, my sobriety, all they can do is fire me. And if those are the worse things that can happen, then I'm ok if they do. I'd really  really   really  rather they didn't but I can survive that stuff, done it before.   So I'm looking forward to it. At least this hour.  I'm sure it will change and I'll get scared again before 8am tomorrow but that's ok.  Freedom is a good smellin' pup again, laundry is done, and I got good healthy stuff from Trader Joe's for lunch so I think I'm set. Not much left to do but sleep! :)

      This year has been such a whirlwind of good and bad.  It started out so horribly bad and looks like it is going to be ending so amazingly good. (These things have been published in this journal as they ahppened as well.)  In the last 2 months alone my life has flipped yet another 180 degrees. It all started after finding out Freedom need surgery.  I set up a website hoping to raise even just $100.  Five days later I had raised almost $800.    Three weeks later I got into a pretty bad car accident, and while I walked away pretty much unharmed, my car didn't.  For 2 weeks I went back and forth with the insurance company and body shop trying to get it fixed. The day I got a call saying it was to be totaled, I got a phone call from M.A. saying it was time to go car shopping and it was his gift to me.  I got a 1994 Explorer the next day.  A vehicle I have wanted for years and never thought I would own.  I was still stressed out about the difference between what I owed on my totaled car and what the insurance company would give me but at least I had wheels now and knew no one could take them from me.  A week later I got the call from the insurance company I had been dreading.  It was time to discuss the figures for my car.  To my amazement, they were paying me $1500 more than the most I thought I would get.  I called the finance company to set up a payment schedule for the balance.  Once again, I was being taken care of.  The difference between what I owed and the pay out from my insurance company was only $134. Not the $2000 I feared.    During that same week I got a call from a recruiter for a job I hadn't even applied for.  He simply saw my resume on  urlLink Monster.com  and called.  3 days and 2 interviews after his initial call, I now have a job back in the technology field.  My only requests were that this job let me have Sunday morning free for church and that it pay at least $12 an hour so I could keep my financial obligations and still move out.  This job is weekends off and well over that rate of pay.  Freedom had his surgery and is doing wonderfully.  He was back to his old self within a couple of days.   I won't go into all the horrible things that happened at the beginning of the year because they don't matter. Sure, they still hurt and I definitely still feel the sting from some of them, but the wonderful ways I have been taken care of this last couple months more than make up for that.  Sometimes you have to walk through the fire to come out alive. The things written about here are just some of the things that have happened, just some of the gifts I have been given.  There isn't enough time this morning to explain the inside changes that have begun to happen.    I haven't done anything to deserve the gifts I have gotten.  I haven't even begun to write about the all the gifts that have come simply by being sober.  The only thing I continued to do was keep on keepin' on and to stay sober.  I cried, I threw temper tantrums, I wailed against fate, people and God, I surrendered and took it back but I kept on going.  That is the only thing I did right.  Everything else wasn't me doing it.  I guess the moral of this story is no matter what happens its going to be ok.... eventually and that God does take care of us but sometimes it takes a bigger smack upside the head for some of us.  A lot of human will was involved in all these things, but I believe it was God using them to help me.  I want to be able to be of that same service some day.

      What an amazing, wonderful day. Went down to SFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) to see the Chagall exhibit. Wow.  Its the only thing I can say.  To try to describe the works I saw today simply lead to sensory overload all over again. So many many many colors and images and sights and sounds of the museum, the smells of the visitors, (not all good) it was just SO intense.  And something I wouldn't trade for the world.    If someone told me a year ago I would be in SF twice in one week, viewing  real  art each time, I would have said they were crazy. While art is still like many subjects in my life, I am sorta kinda starting to get it.  I definitely know what I like, definitely know what I don't like and the millions of works that lie between are eye candy right now.    It was just amazing. The day was so awesome, wonderful sights, wonderful company, wonderful conversation.  Just enjoying life with a couple of friends.  I'm not sure it gets much better than that.    I am so very tired though and that extra hour of sleep tonight is going to be put to good use!

      I went to a potluck tonight with a bunch of women I don't know.  It was fun though.  I dunno... my small talk skills suck in a big way and I never have anything to say.  I know it a matter of learning and stuff but, well, its gonna be a long process.  I am so sick of everything being a process.  What I wouldn't give to have a transformation.

      Its been a long day.  I have been on the run since 9:30 this morning and am finally home.  I'm drained, emotionally, physically and mentally.  My brain is on hyperoverdrive.  I'm overly sensitive now (yes, more so than usual) and I'm hoping sleep tonight takes care of it.  It wasn't a bad day, actually it was pretty good.  Just busy.  Looking forward to hanging out with a friend tomorrow afternon.  Saturday is SF with Ju to see the Chagall exhibit and Sunday is getting ready for Monday.  :)

      I am in a serious state of fear.  Things have gone too good too fast.  I feel like I am walking on that sheet of thin ice in that old board game "Don't Break The Ice". I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and I am terrified of what it will be.    So my choices are fear or anger.  Fear to me, is an emotion of inaction.  Its paralyzing in its grip and it causes me to freeze up.  Anger is an action emotion to me.  I run fast. I drive fast. I talk fast. I react fast. I do fast.  Fear is simply not an option so I'm angry.  It makes no logical sense and this angers me even more.  That I can be so stupid, so illogical.  Knowing that my fears are illogical or at the very least, somewhat improbable.  Its sort of like the notion of winning the lottery.  Oh sure, its a possibility but not a very probable one.  I can intellectually tell myself this stupid all I want, it doesn't make the fear go away.   Yep, I'm a big girl and big girls don't get scared and they don't cry. So what am I so damn afraid of.   I'm scared that I can't do this job.  Scared that I can't adapt to the routine of working again.  Scared that I can't remember how to be a tech support agent. Scared that they won't like me.  Scared that they will find out "who I really am". Scared that everything negative I have ever thought about myself will be confirmed in one day.  Scared that this new way of trying to live is going to collapse and I will be left in a limbo of not being to able to live in the old ways and not able to grasp the new ones.  Just plain scared.  So my option is to freeze entirely or get pissed off about it.    I want to hold everyone at bay for fear if they see me like this they will run. I am tired of needing support and guidance, tired of needing period.  I am getting disgusted with myself and while my life is yes, finally pulling itself in the right direction, that scares me even more. It boils down to this: I don't particularly care for me therefore no one else can and once they realize how inadequate, bad, needy, stupid, incapable I am, they will leave anyway, so I might as well give them that push in the other direction.  Because you see if I push them away its my decision and it won't hurt as bad.

      And the good news still keeps on coming....  I went to the job interview this morning.  It went very well, I liked the interviewer and I think he liked me.  We just clicked and that is always a good feeling.  The job sounds like a wonderful opportunity, more money that I would have asked for and "normal people" hours. I have an interview with the managers tomorrow afternoon and should know sometime tomorrow if I got the job or not.  The only scary thing is that it would start Monday and well frankly, I'm scared. Its been a long time since I have worked and even longer still since I have worked in a call center technical environment. I know I have the skills.... they are just a bit rusty. There is no way to polish them up though without jumping right in.  Its an awesome opportunity and if I am offered it, I'm definitely taking it.  I also spoke to the car insurance company and my finance company, the difference between what I owe on the Honda and what they are paying me for it is a total of about $140.  So that major financial burden is gone.  Once the contributors to Freedom's Fund are paid back, I'll owe very little and I can go back to school.  Hopefully in January.  The idea scares me silly though.    There has been so much good this week that I am looking forward with one eye closed waiting for something really bad to happen.  But ya know what.... I don't think its gonna.  God has taken care of me beyond my expectations and I have people in my life that help when needed.  Its amazing.  I'm starting to feel lucky to be me instead of lucky to just have "stuff".

      I got up and call my insurance company to find out how much I owe them.  Turns out through a snafu on their part, I haven't been insured the last week and a half.  3 hours later it got straightened out but sheesh  its been a while since I have been  that  frustrated. I also talked to M.A. who saw the post on my entry about the painting.  His mother in law is on the arts council and she got him a phone conference with Robert Watson.  I'll have a lithograph of my painting in 7 weeks!  I am way excited.  I can't wait!  That painting did something to me.  And now... I'll get to see it every day!!!!    I also got a call for a job.  I'd be doing tech support for AAA's call center employees.  I go talk to the contract guy tomorrow.  I'm not supposed to go back to work yet but.... in this job market, I can't turn it down if the money is right.  Its temp to perm with a 3 month commitment.  I'll get the work hours and pay scale tomorrow I guess.    All good stuff but definitely not any of what I thought would happen when I opened my eyes this morning!

      While I doubt that it is my lot in life by design, I get the idea I will be part of the eternally frustrated.    I'm frustrated with myself, my thought processes, my direction in life, my lack of... (not material stuff but inside stuff). I know that I have come a long way in sobriety.  I know I have come a long way this year.  Yet I want to be further along.  I want to know more and I can seem to learn it as fast as I want.  I want I want I want seems to be the motto and what is more frustrating is while at times that applies to material things, more often than not lately it is applying to inside stuff.  Stuff that cannot be bought or traded, things that cannot be bartered for.  I know, I have tried making deals and bargains and I don't seem to be getting it through osmosis.  I  know  its a process.  I  know  I have made progress.  I know too though there is still so much  more  progress to be made.   I want it all NOW.  More better more different more now.

      I had the most amazing experiences yesterday.  I saw REAL art.  I saw Dali and Chagall and Rembrandt and Picasso. There was a gallery we walked by with the most amazing picture of a field of sunflowers and by this time I was starting to really like what I was seeing and even understanding the faintest amount so I went in and found a painting I fell in love with.  I can now say I understand when people say "It spoke to me".   urlLink This painting  (Turning Point II by Robert Watson) might as well have been a book from everything I read into it.  There is the person standing there, they have done some growth in life, coming out of a darkness and into the life. They have done footwork by walking up the steps and they are now at a turning point.  They look tired, weary from their walk but they have to decide.  Do they keep going, tired as they are farther into the light?  Or do they keep walking on the plateau they have reached into an abyss of nothingness?  Or there is the decision to turn back and return to the darkness. There is the white flag of surrender they will reach if they keep walking. Yet they have already experienced that light by simply starting to walk up the stairs.  There are also 2 shadows that seem to be in a face off if they walk into the abyss.  Its so amazing.    I might never own the original but someday, I'm going to own a print. I couldn't stop thinking about it after we left the gallery and obviously can't stop thinking about it now.  I want to meet the artist, sit down with him and say "this is what I saw, what did you mean? And what does this signify? And why did you choose these colors? And and and" :)  I know my facial expressions always give me away.  Love, hate, sadness, hurt, etc have never been unreadable in my face through my eyes.  I can't conceal what I feel and I'm sure the excitement and comprehension yesterday was no different.

      More pictures!  The photos from the camping trip were also picked up today.  I haven't scanned them all in yet but  urlLink here's  the cutest of the bunch (all Freedom of course).   Early morning plans tomorrow so I am off to bed.

      I got the photos back from Freedom's surgery.  The pictures can be seen  urlLink here .  Not a bad day all in all, went and had lunch with M.A. Afterward I was supposed to go meet with my sponsee but she cancelled so Freedom and I headed over to the park so he could get a little fresh air and exercise. Went through Sam's Club to get the pictures and now I'm home.  I'm so tired lately, I'm hoping tonight will be a good sleeping night.

      I think people learn how to treat us not by how we treat them, but by how we let them treat us.    Most of my life I have let people make me feel like I am less than them.  That I must be in some constant state of need or crisis for the friendship to continue.  What I am learning though is that the longer I am sober, the less crisis and need I have.  And what has happened is there have been times that I have needed to generate some crisis for fear of losing that friendship.  That doesn't need to happen anymore.  Through events in the last few weeks, the number of friendships I have is dwindling.  When I first realized this I was almost panicked.  "What's wrong with me?" and after more thinking and writing, I realized, maybe the unhealthy friendship have to go so that I can focus on the few healthy ones I have and begin other healthy friendships.    I don't think any relationship can ultimately last when it is based on need.  I think it has to be a relationship built on commonalities, and care and concern for one's well being without having to fill the need to control the other person.  More often than not, I have allowed myself to be controlled and while I didn't like it, fear of rejection or having to stand alone kept me from stopping that control.  Its something I don't want in my life and I guess identifying the problem is the first step.

      The meeting in Coloma was so cool!  We saw 4 or 5 deer on the drive in off Hwy 50, there were coyotes howling during the meeting and the stars we so bright!  I'm really glad I went. It was well worth the drive.

      New layout.... once again. I just want a simplistic way to upload this journal so that I am not fussing and fretting with formatting and HTML scripting.  Hoping this is better.     I went this morning to get my pins out but.... the doctor said they need to stay in for another month. The bone isn't callusing or calcifying or cal-something the way its supposed to. And removing the pins at this point will lead to having to have a plate put in later. So the pins stay. One surgery and one set of metal things in my hand is enough for such a lil finger. I have a new cast though and I'm not going to be able to work for another month.   I also got a call from the woman I was to start house sitting for next month and her deployment date has been moved to December at the earliest. I'll still get to house sit, just not yet. I spent the evening at Ju's last night and had a little of the emotional meltdown that has been building as of late. We relaxed and I ended up falling asleep while watching  urlLink Gilmore Girls . There is just something about the house that makes me feel all safe and sometimes safe can lead to sleepy when the lights are off and the TV is on.   I'm supposed to go to a meeting tonight in Coloma but I am SO sleepy. I don't know if I'll make it. Gonna have to see how I feel in a few hours. Right now is definitely nap time.

      Lately I can't seem to focus. On anything really. I've been compared to a butterfly just flitting from here to there without really landing anywhere and I guess that's about accurate. Its not just the apartment or the job or anything really. I think its a mixture of too much at one time. I just can't concentrate. ADD child at her worst right now. Normally I could deal with that but with all the changes and because of all the stuff I'm not sleeping well, hence the 4 am post. Its make me hypersensitive and I feel like I am on the verge of tears most the time. I hate feeling unfocused and ungrounded. I'm hitting a meeting on my lunch hour today.   I have a bunch of guys coming over Saturday morning to help me move, or rather move me. Friday there is no work which is a mixed blessing. I could have used the money and no work means no pay. At the same time I have so much to do its kind of a good thing. Not sure exactly when this phone number gets turned off only that the new one will be active today I hope. All the utilities go into my name today and cable gets installed Saturday. I pick the keys up for the apartment on my way home tonight from work. Tomorrow is the Race for the Hungry and then I think I am just going to bring stuff to the apartment and veg there afterwards with Freedom. I was invited to dinner at a friend's place and I might run over to eat but I really kind of just want to relish in being *home*.

      Things are good.   The day started out with the "what can go wrong will go wrong" type stuff but it has righted itself enough to turn into a good day.  I'm so excited about moving, it seems to be the only thing I can really focus on these days.   Its going to be so nice to have my space back and to have my own place.

      Its been fairly quiet here today.  This morning was busy but the last hour or so, I've spent looking around online at curtains and towels and just stuff like that.  Made  urlLink wishlist  and looked at deals on ebay.  Its kind of fun imagining all the possibilities.

      Ay vey.  I have spent most this weekend packing, getting boxes and obsessing on how to decorate, trying to get prices on blinds and curtains and the like.  I have a lot of ideas and little money.  And for once, that's ok.  This gets to be an ongoing project and that sort of makes it fun.  My only real have to have item right now is curtains and blinds.  The rest will come together with time.  Ju and I went and looked at it again last night and I still love it.  It just has a warm feeling when I look at it.  I can't wait to move in. Only 3 more days before I have keys and less than a week from now, I'll be moved in.

      Things are good.  Good day at work.  Getting things set up for the apartment.  I have never had such a short notice on moving before and normally I'd be so panicked but given that I am in such a liberal environment, I have gotten everything set up.  Its absolutely wonderful.  I'm happy here and that is the best gift any job could give me.

      I have a new apartment.  Ok its really called a flat but I can't tell the difference.  Its 2 bedrooms, one bathroom, I have a washer and a dryer and a dishwasher and a fridge and I LOVE it!.  I can't wait to move in! I'm getting the keys next Wednesday and think I might just spend Thanksgiving day in my apartment!    I also got the pins out today.  It hurt.  A lot!  But I'm glad they're out and while I still have a cast, at least I know I am on the road to recovery!

      Its good stuff but still a problem nonetheless.  Where I am working now, I am on a 3 month contract. Nothing is guaranteeing that I will become permanent. I like it there though, I have plenty of time to study should I choose to, I love the guys I work with. Financially even if I got that apartment, I could swing it.   It appears though that I might be offered a position with another company. As a database analyst. Something I would have to learn. Major stress there. But its about $5k a year more, permanent and with benefits. Its a longer commute as well. Its also a great opportunity and the money would be nice.   I don't know what to do. I am thinking about talking to my current boss, not as an ultimatum by any means, more though as a help! type thing. If they were to take me on permanent, even at the rate of pay I make now, I would stay there over going to this new job. I'm safe there, comfortable there, happy there and the money just wouldn't be worth it. But I need benefits. I need sick days. I need vacation days. I need to know my job is definitely going to be longer than 3 months. Especially before committing myself to this apartment.  Help.

      I'm here.  I'm sick.  But I'm here.  Its been a busy but good weekend.  I think I found the perfect apartment.  Its a little more, ok a lot more, than I wanted to pay every month but its almost kitty corner to Ju's place, 2 bedrooms and I can have Freedom.  We'll see, I turned in an application because they weren't requiring an app fee sooooo maybe I'll get it.  I can swing it financially, it would just be tighter than I wanted it to be.  But it would be safe and its freshly remodeled and I love it.  So I've done the footwork and if I an supposed to get it, God will provide the rest.

      I picked up the keys yesterday for the house I'm be staying at.  Yay!  The day was incredibly long though and I woke up this morning with the beginnings of a cold.  Gee, Shannon, you thought you would go literally non stop for 2 weeks and NOT get sick? Duh.  I got a call though from a girl in a recovery house.  I spoke there a few months ago and she has a pass this Saturday and has to spend the day with another woman in recovery.  And she called me.  She's a sweetheart and has my name! So we are gonna hang out Saturday afternoon.  We can hit a meeting and then what?  Coffee I guess and then... I dunno.  It will be interesting.

      Sometimes I just want to be held.  That craving for physical human contact becomes overwhelming. Nothing more than simply being held, hugged, unromantic yet compassionately touched. Yet pride, ego and fear get in the way.  So many have ulterior motives, hidden agendas, unspoken feelings.  It becomes not worth it when the cost is considered.  Sometimes I want to disappear.  Not run away, simply disappear for awhile.  No commitments, no responsibilities, just nothingness.    Sometimes I cry at funny movies and laugh at sad ones.  So many scripts and books are written to elicit emotion, yet sometimes they are overdone and simply comical.  Sometimes I wonder if there is truly a way to rewrite the past. Not to change events or their outcomes but to change my perception.  To make it so that lessons were actually learned instead of having to be repeated.    Sometimes I long to be ugly.  While I am no show stopper, people tend to see me but not hear me.  How frustrating it is to know that intelligence has to be proven for someone to see past the outside.  Sometimes I drive fast just because I can.  Something akin to tempting fate.    Sometimes I smile when I only want to cry.  No one wants to be around someone who is always upset.  It pulls people down, its draining and overwhelming to be around all the time.  Sometimes I wish that everything I have done right I did wrong and everything I did wrong I did right.  Sort of a checks and balance system to see what side adds up more.  Sometimes I don't want to know me.  For what I see on he inside you could never fathom when looking from the outside.  Yet what you see on the outside I can never understand from looking within.  Sometimes I long to be ignorant.  To be happy with *less than* or under-achieving.  What I expect from myself, I would never dare to expect from others, yet the expectations rise daily.

      I had dinner last night with a couple friends and all their babies.  It was nice.  They are both exceptional people with quantities of love and acceptance I can only hope to have one day.  I got on of the Jars of Clay CDs yesterday in the mail from a friend on  urlLink LJ  and while I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, I can't wait!  Yesterday M.A. and I had lunch.  I realized as I was driving to meet him, just how much I miss having those weekly lunches!  Work definitely bites in regards to that.    Freedom has a staph infection, nothing major that antibiotics and a sterios shot won't clear up but he was definitely uncomfortable.  $100 my baby is non-itchy, and relatively happily back on his way to recovery.  I am just incredibly tired.  I have plans tonight and tomorrow night but Thursday and Friday are going to be reserved to getting some rest.   A friend and I were talking last night and apparently its time for me to grow up.  This wasn't said meanly or cruelly, nothing like that at all, simply matter of fact.  This is probably very true.  The problem is though that I don't know what the traits of a grown up are.  Does it mean that I do everything by myself and don't lean on people?  Does it mean that I don't talk to anyone about what's going on? That I don't ask anyone for help? I don't know what *grown up* looks like. Its not like I have had a lot of examples to follow.  And I think my fear of growing up stems from the fear of not doing it right, especially when I don't know what *right* is.  Its frustrating.  I just want to do everything right all the time.   And without a way of measuring right, I don't know how to do it.

      It seems that when there is too much going on I shut down.  This has been the case as of late.  Too many plans, too many emotions, too much stuff - too overwhelming for me. Everything is going as it should I guess, its just been too much for me and when I have had the time to sit and write, I have instead just shut down.  Its been necessary.    I saw Jars of Clay last night with Caedmon's Call an they put on an awesome show.  Saturday night was Girls' Movie night and it was nice.  We ended up sitting around and talking instead of actually watching a movie but the conversation was good.  I have the beginnings of a new life falling into place and its good.  I'm scared though and that tempers the excitement. Studying, women friends that want nothing more than friendship, housesitting, new job, new car, new well.... me.  I guess its normal.    It's amazing to me that people actually trust me with things like housekeys and their house.   I start housesitting for 6 months on the 24th.  I'm happy about it, a little scared about it, however I am mostly looking forward to the space it is going to give Freedom and I.  He'll have a huge backyard and I'll have a 3 bedroom house to roam around in.  Its a good thing.

      I am just too busy for my own good.  Its all good stuff but I am getting tired. Plans to be out every night are great however, this girl needs some downtime.  Next week I'm scheduling it.  The flip side though is that I am grateful to have a life back.  After I started seeing M, I gave up a lot of it to sit and wait for him.  I lost touch with a lot of people and stopped making plans I should have made.  When he and I split up, I was left with nothing but a lot of time on my hands.  Moderation though is obviously a lesson I haven't learned yet!  :)

      Things have been somewhat of a whirlwind since Friday.  This working thing has seriously cut into my social life! :) Friday I worked and then went and watched an awesome movie at Ju's.  Chinese food and a good movie and good convo equals a good night. Saturday was a little shopping.  I needed to get new clothes for work.  It was time and while I had enough to get through last week, there was no way I could go through the same 5 outfits again.  So I got a buncha stuff!  Almost everything was 50% off and I got awesome deals all the way around.  Sunday was dinner at an old friend's house.  A few of the pictures have been posted already.  Things are good just seriously busy.  I think I might have to let a couple commitments go.  I admit, I am a wimp.  I like my down time, in fact, my down is essential for me not getting sick.   Life is life though.  Its going really good.  So good that how it looked 6 months ago and how it looks now are two different beasts altogether!  And that my dear, is a good thing.

We had a good time and once again, Freedom was so well behaved I was amazed he was the same dog!  Work was good, same ol, same ol.  And at this point I am exhausted and ready for bed.  Tomorrow is going to be even longer.

      It was a good day.  I went to church this morning and then did a project I have been meaning to do for a while and then off to dinner with a woman I used to work at Apple with.  She even invited Freedom to dinner.  He was so well behaved. Far better than I thought he would.  It was a nice evening and now the rain is pouring and I am lookin forward to cozying up and falling asleep to the sound of it.

      Our society is essentially made of *haves* and *have nots*.  I'm not referring to a *have not* as someone who is driving a beater of a car and working at a lowing paying job.  I am referring to the *have nots* that literally have nothing but what they push in a shopping cart or carry in a bag.  They live on the streets of every city of every state in this country.    While a man in a BMW fiddling with his laptop, talking on a cell phone fights with his wife about what house they should purchase next, the man on the corner wonders when he will get to eat again.  A lot of people ignore them, for blindness is easier than caring.  It is easier to pretend they do not exist, than to admit "that could be me".  We're all guilty of it. Everyone has done it.  More often than not I haven't given to the man or woman holding the sign because I am greedy and cannot police the way they are going to spend my spare change.   What if though, every one of the people in the *have* group made one bag lunch every day and gave it to a *have not*.  Something simple, a sandwich, a juice box, some fruit and some chips.  The kind of lunch we resented getting when we were 13 because they weren't cool.  Its inexpensive to do, takes very little time to make and even less time to give away.  Wouldn't then there be a little less of the *have nots*?  Its hard to make a good impression for a job interview when you haven't eaten in 3 days.  Its hard to not consider shoplifting that sandwich if its the only prospect of food.  Sure, some are homeless by choice.  A lot aren't though. Through any series of decisions they made, they are living on a street with nothing.  I know I could have easily been there.    Last year it was a serious possibility.  It might not have been long term and I am sure any one of my friends and family would have let me stayed with them but not everyone has those options.   No single person can feed everyone.  But every single person can feed just one.

      My journal is going to be changing.  I have never made it a secret that all hits to this page as well as several others on my website are monitored. I don't care too much really about who reads what on here however when I see the same IP address hitting my journal five ten or fifteen times a day, it makes me uncomfortable. I have blocked access from thier IP using an htaccess file, they change their IP, I block the new one, they get a third one.  So I am in effect, going underground with my journal for an unknown time period.  If you wish to be added to the mailing list and have my entries emailed to you, please  urlLink email me  and let me know.  Maybe this seems a bit paranoid or defeating the purpose and to be honest, I don't care.  Its unnerving to have someone checking back so very often during the day to see what is going on in my life.

      I worked yesterday until 1 and then came home, took a nap and B stopped by.  I gave her E's presents and got mine, and then I met Ju for church.  It was a beautiful service, candle lighting at the end and it really brought home the true meaning of Christmas.  We went to dinner at  urlLink Mikuni's , a wonderful Japanese restaurant that opened not too long ago. Oh man was the food good!  Came home and watched   urlLink Evelyn  , a total tearjerker, very, very good though.  I fell asleep during the second movie,   urlLink A Christmas Carol   .  Such a difference from last year's Christmas Eve.  I expected last year to be this big wonderful event and ended up being disappointed.  I expected this year to be uneventful and lonely and it turned out to be absolutely wonderful.  Today I slept in lately, went and saw a friend, her husband and their twins. Then my mom came over, we ate, I played with my  urlLink new video camera .  WOW!  This thing has SO many functions.  I can't wait to start recording stuff! Thank you again Dad.  You have spoiled me rotten!   This evening has been mellow and I am getting ready to head to bed.  Working the opening shift tomorrow and being there at 6:30 AM bites in a big way.  It's ok though, one early day and then a sleep in day.    I hope everyone had as wonderful a Christmas as I did.  Merry Christmas everyone.

      Yesterday more than made up for all the down time we have ever had here.  The call volume was higher than probably a full week of calls all packed into one.  It was crazy.  I'm still trying to catch up from this past weekend.  Christmas is sneaking up on me way too fast.  I got a new camcorder from Dad last night.  I can't wait to start using it!  I'm so excited!  Watch for movies to be posted soon!

      I got my index files back up and running, for full details of what happened, go  urlLink here .    I saw the ortho surgeon Wednesday and it seems like I will eventually need to have another surgery.  My pinkie is *scissoring* over my ring finger and frequently gets stuck.  While its not causing any extra damage, it is painful when it gets stuck and quite embarassing.   I spent last night dealing with the landlord and all his lies.  I don't like the situation and am looking into what options I have available to move to.  I love the apartment, I hate moving, I love the setup of the place as it was promised, I hate the landlord.  Its all a mess.   On a funky note,  urlLink this  looks fun.

      I have a Christmas tree, lights, an entertainment center and a glider rocker, all compliments of Dad. Had a nice talk with the new neighbors.  They had no idea how loud it was.  They are really nice and as usual I prejudged without giving them a chance.  I think things will be ok now on that front.  Or at least workable.  Its a nice feeling, even if it means I was wrong.

      Thanks to my Dad, I have a Christmas tree!  Woohoo!  And the best part is no tree died in the process of me getting into the Christmas spirit.  Its potted so after the holiday I can plant it or re-pot it or something so I can use it again and again and again!  I can't wait to decorate it.

      The bratdog has an eye, ear and skin infection.  No idea what is causing it for sure other than possibly still the thyroid problem.  More ointments and antibiotics.  New neighbors upstairs.  Not liking them all too much as I don't enjoy listening to them hang pictures above my bedroom at 10 at night.  We'll have to see how it goes.  The apartment has been a disappointment in so many ways.  I love the feel it has, I love the inside however we are going on almost 3 weeks with no cable and no sign of it.  I am tired of the landlords excuse and honestly the whole thing is taking on the appearance of a joke.  *sigh*

      I got a concerned comment based on another comment (now deleted).  I have a family like few people I know.  There is only one blood relative in this family, all the rest have been adopted by me or have adopted me themselves.  And I say adopted not in the legal term but in the term of the heart.    It took me 27 years but I now have a Dad. Oh my biological one is somewhere out there.  Actually last I knew he lives about 30 minutes from me.  But neither he nor I have the desire to be a part of each others lives.  He chose not to be in my life as a dad for the first 16 or 17 years and I have chosen not to be in his life on his terms the last 11.  And that's ok.  I don't think he is a bad person, nor even neccessarily a bad father to my half brother, honestly, I don't know the man.  There are no hard feelings on this end and I wish him the best, however he and I both do better I think out of each other's lives.  I have a new dad though.  One that I met some time ago and he has adopted me into his heart as I have adopted him.  Any comments left by Dad are from him.    I appreciate the concern and care especially from someone I have never met, however, please let me assure you, nothing inappropriate has or will happen on that front.  Thank you for the concern.

      All the curtains are up.  Woohoo!  Sponsee is coming over in a bit and then I have to run to the grocery store.  Ironing left to do and then I should be set for another week of work. All in all a decent weekend.  I am so not ready for Christmas.

      Still sick.  It still sucks.  I still have boxes. I am still procrastinating on the whole theory of Christmas.  Freedom still takes up 75% of the bed every night.  I still love the apartment and hate the landlord.  There is still no cable.    Still trying to sit still in it all.

      I have the flu.  It feels like an elephant sitting on my chest.  Darn good thing I am quitting smoking anyway, this would force me to if I wasn't.    I am so not a good sick girl.

      I'm here, not much has changed.  I got new sheets and new towels yesterday, thanks to M.A. I am all unpacked out for now.  I just can't seem to find the motivation to keep unpacking.  Housewarming party will be mid January and I'm sure I can hide most of what is left by then.  :)

      Ok so I have phone at home and I was supposed to be getting cable installed today.  However, the contractor never came back and installed the cabling inside the house that is needed. On Saturday I was told by the landlord and the contractors that it would be done Sunday.  After not seeing any workmen Sunday, I called the contractor and he told me to call the landlord because some guy named Steve needed to be contacted about it.  So I called the landlord and after acting like he's all put out about it, he agrees to call him.  K, hi, not the property manager, this is your shit not mine buddy. I explained to him that if its not going to get done, I need to know so I can cancel the cable provider appointment.   I didn't hear anything back from him, nothing yesterday and nothing this morning.  So Comcast shows up and they aren't happy.  This is their third time coming to this place only to find out nothing is in place.  Twice for me, once for the third floor. So I call the landlord and he tells me that maybe I should wait until the cable is physically installed before making the appointment.  Gee, I'm sorry, I made the mistake of thinking if you said it was taken care of, it was actually taken care of. And then he has the nerve to tell me he is just as frustrated as I am about the situation.  No buddy, you couldn't possibly be.  You have a television that gets more than 2 staticy black and white channels.  The 3 bedroom windows, still painted shut, his remedy:  I  should scrape the panes to fix it.  Ummmm yeah, no.  Not unless we are talking about deducting more from the rent.  I took 10 days for him to get someone out to fix the telephone and the leaking sink and dishwasher, god only knows how long before the horrid patch job in the bedrooms on the ceiling gets fixed and yet I am supposed to fix windows too?  And pay top dollar for this place?  Oh I so don't think so!  So still no cable.  And no idea when.    Then B called and said they are talking about me and my position at my homegroup because I didn't show up to the business meeting this past Sunday.  Well, I didn't go because I didn't know about it.  Had I known I definitely would have been there but no one contacted me via phone, email or any other way to tell me.  Including B, who came by the new apartment this past Wednesday.    So I give up.  It is apparently one of those days.

      Sort of.  I must say though, it feels dang good to have the laundry done, work clothes ironed, the floors mopped and vacuumed, Christmas lights hung and boxes thrown away and the dishwasher running.  Especially when its all by 8 PM.  All the essentials are pretty much unpacked.  I still need to hang the curtains in my bedroom but its not too big of a deal.  I feel quite accomplished although very tired.  Its time to go snuggle up with the mutt and watch a movie before bed.

      Wow!  There is nothing better than sleeping in a bed with brand new sheets, a brand new dust ruffle and a brand new duvet all at the same time!  And even better to get out of the shower into big fluffy new towels!    This weekend I am hanging curtains and curtain rods, getting an alarm installed in my truck and unpacking.  Uneventful to some but fun to me. Hopefully I'll even get a working phone line.  Doubtful but I haven't given up hope yet!

      The phone contractor came last night.  I am still phone less.  We did have a good talk though and it sounds like it will be a few weeks before I get cable.  Something has to be torn up and replaced and reseated and installed and a dohickey is needed in someplace and well, yeah.  Its got a long ways to go.  Hopefully I can get my phone up by Saturday night though.  Trying to unpack at least one box a night so far has been working but I am running out of easy boxes to unpack!  How tempting to just take them out and donate them!  :)  I got to have a long talk last night with my upstairs neighbor and she is a sweetie.  With him being a chef and her being so nice, we'll have fun.  Especially since I have the Freedo mutt to seal the deal.

      So I just found out I am going to be a flower girl.  A bit old you might say? Well, sort of but not really.  I met this group of people in November of 1997.  It was a very eclectic group, all of having little to nothing in common other than sobriety.  Or in my case,  the desire to get some sobriety.  I didn't know then but 3 of the people in that group would later save my life.  I ended up staying with 2 of them, living with a third for a bit until I took care of her house when she moved.  At one point I could picture each and every one of these people as if they were people I had met in person. We were and I suppose still are, the Richard Cranium family.  We even made a family tree. I was, of course, the baby of the family and at 21 was by far the youngest.  Well 2 of them are getting married. Its a marriage we all have been waiting for and I am so happy for them.  And they have asked me to be the flower girl.  *dances in a circle*    It will be interesting but I can guarantee one thing for sure...  I ain't wearin' pink.

      Last night was nice, took Freedom for a nice long walk with Ju.  Got home and made dinner.  Yes, I actually cooked.  And it was yummy.  At least to me!  I got all kinds of stuff from M.A. too!  Curtains and sheets and towels and silverware and and and...  :)   Muchly loved stuff.    I have been doing a lot of thinking as I am a bit burnt on the radio and well, I don't know.  That's it I guess.  I don't know what I don't know and I don't understand what I don't know.    Very tired.  Tonight is gonna be an early one.

      So with having no phone and no tv, I get a lot done in the evenings.  I went home last night, let Freedom out and then headed to the grocery store.  For being single and not buying anything for the animals, I still don't get how I spent as much as I did.  However I have a ton of food in the house now and many many many meals I can fix.  Spoke with the landlord today and the General Contractor is supposed to come over Thursday to fix the short in the walls for the phone and finish off making the entire building cable ready.  Things are settling in, last night I got my electric blanket on the bed and between the featherbed, the electric blanket, the down comforter and 3 cats and a dog, I was toasty last night.  I love having the house cold and the bed all warm snuggly.  It does make it so hard to get out of bed in the morning though!  Things are good, I'm just blue I guess.  I don't know how to describe.  Everything is wonderful with my life and I have nothing to want or need for and really not a thing to complain about, yet I still feel vaguely down.  I can't explain it.  Maybe its just the time of year it is.    Freedom and I went for a walk last night sort of late and before I realized it I was in an area largely populated with homeless people and I felt a twinge of fear at first.  No one had done anything to me or even given me a reason to be scared.  But Freedom and I kept on and got to say hi to people we had never met.  Next thing I knew I was back home and we were safe and sound.  I think I like it there.  Maybe it'll keep me humble.

      Sometimes its the little things in life that bring me the most happiness  Waking up to a passed out pooch that is snuggled up next to me  Watching that same pooch sleep in the way other women watch their children  Having the luxury of playing my music, the tv and mp3's on the computer all at the same time  Knowing that my house will look the same when I return as it did when I left it in the morning  Going to bed knowing that the laundry is clean and ironed, boxes have been unpacked and I am ready for work  Waking up and not having to rush to get ready  Sitting on the front porch, no traffic or people sounds, talking to God  Waking up with a kitten *fixing* my hair for me  Putting together a bookcase all by myself.... and it not crashing down  Driving an Explorer in the rain with brand new tires  The knowledge that I have everything I need and then some

      I'm here.  Sort of.  I only have internet access at work right now.  No phone and no cable at the new apartment.  The landlord screwed some things up and it might be a few weeks before those things can be installed.  I got moved in on Saturday and things went well.  I spent most of yesterday unpacking boxes and moving things around and getting things put away. Amazing how much more gets done when I can't plop in front of the tv or stay online all day!   Freedom and the girls are adjusting, I'm adjusting and while Saturday was hard, I am back to loving living alone.  The first night there was weird.  I think I forgot how to be alone like that but last night was great.  I have a long list of things that need to be fixed but I think everything is going to turn out ok.  I met my new neighbors and they seem really nice so I think that's going to be fun.  He's a chef and invited me to come to dinner with him and his girlfriend one night.  They seem really nice and we're together in the whole no communication problems with the landlord.    So I am here, I'm just not real available right now.  If you have my cell phone and need me, call that.  I check the new phone message center now and then but not with any regularity.

Things in the new apartment are slowly getting unpacked but I am just overwhelmed and tired and on the verge of meltdown most days lately.  So I am alive, I'm back and I'll update more later.

      New job started today.  Not a good first day, just feeling very overwhelmed.  I moved over the weekend and have no internet access for about a week.  Things are just basically biting right now.  I can check my email at Julie's but between Saturday night and tonight, over 800 emails came in.  Will be back on when I get back up at home, until then no emails please.    Thanks!

      This is my friggin website.  Just because there are crazy people out there that have no life and refuse to get one does not mean I should have to change my website.  I am tired of other people dictating what will and will not happen in my life.  I worked way too hard on this site to keep it and maintain only to let some asshole run me off from it. If they want to be neurotic about it, so be it.  That's on them. I have a life and if the only thing they can get out of their is to peer into mine well, they are someone to be pitied.  That being said....  This journal is back.    So here's the update:  I got the job at Intel.  I start in a week or so.  I had given the current employer the standard 2 weeks and last night I got a call saying they were ending my contract early.  My boss never said a word when I left yesterday.  Needless to say, my feelings are hurt, I am disappointed in him and I am confused.  I have been told it was a financial decision and I did nothing wrong but then my question becomes, what was the harm in letting me finish out that one week.  Let me retain my dignity and take my things home and say good-bye to the people I worked with. It makes no sense but the notion of going to work for a real company again is ten times more appealing than it was yesterday morning.   I am excited about the opportunity and scared about the financial loss for this coming week.    I'm moving again because nothing with the landlord has been easy.  In the 7 weeks I have been here, nothing has been repaired yet.  I still can't even open the windows here.  I found a place that is a little cheaper every month, a little smaller but right down the block and the 2nd floor renters here are moving to the same place.  They rented the 2nd floor there, I rented the 1st floor.  We do well as neighbors together and I think a friendship is starting up there.  I just wish there was a magic spell I could cast to move all the stuff here to the new place.  *sigh*  How I hate moving.  So that's the latest.  For the most part things are well, the job thing though sure has thrown me for a loop.

      I get to play mom in the morning to a 11 (almost 12) year old.  I kinda like it.  Oh its not much more than getting him up and dropping him off at school but I like the morning interaction and I love the kid.  Je's middle son and I get along great and I think I am going to enjoy the one on one time with him.    Had lunch with Dad on Monday and he is going to subject himself to my cooking Thursday for dinner.  Work is going well, things are just status quo as of now.  :)

      Today was a good day.  I might be Valentine-less but I have good friends and a wonderful surrogate Dad.  Today is also my 3 year sobriety birthday so it made the day more special.  I've never had this much time before!  Ju had a little mini birthday party/ movie night for me.  I got HUGE a print of Matisse's   urlLink Icarus  (my favorite of the  Jazz  series) and beautiful planted purple flowers and my chip came from Je, it was originally her 3 year chip.  Dad sent me flowers this morning and they came with a little teddy bear and a box of chocolate.   Needless to say, I am feeling quite the spoiled princess tonight and am off to sleep as a very happy girl.  A year ago, I never though I would have the people in my life that I do now, and I never thought the people that wouldn't be in my life would leave.  Through the seemingly good and the seemingly bad, change always happens and its up to me whether I fight it or accept it.

      So, today being Feb 13.... I have 3 years  of sobriety tomorrow! Its funny, I still have the old mantras in my head that people said, "You'll never make it to 1 year".  I did it.  I proved them wrong and I proved myself wrong.  One foot in front of the other, I have managed to survve this last year and not only grow from it, but stay mostly sane as well.  This weekend will be a big weekend of reflection for me.... a year ago I thought I couldn't stand to live even one more.  Now, I made it and lived to tell about it.

Of course my competitiveness has kicked in full bore and I want to be the best on the team. ;o)  While the chances are slim of that happening this week, maybe someday it will!  The new apartment is still wonderful, Freedom and I are adjusting pretty well I think to all the new noises.   Life is just well, life right now.  Some good days, some bad days and a whole lot of ok days.

Other than a new job and a new apartment, things are status quo.  I love the new apartment, it safer and has a much homier feel to it.  I am quite happy with how things are shaping up in the work and home arenas.

      Ok so its been a while since I have done much of an update.  Things are going well.   Work is good, I survived my first corporate virus crisis, thank you  urlLink Bagle  virus.  It was crazy and some days were better than others, but I survived.  I am making new friends at working, getting closer to my new friends at home, just in general, doing life.  I am starting to find out that I am likeable, maybe even to the point that people seek me out to spend time with me rather than simply tolerating my presence.  Its an odd thing to learn this late in life. To think that people think I am optimistic and perky is just very strange for me.  It seems the person I was is fading and the person I am becoming is shining.

      Ok so here goes for the real update....  Work: Going quite well I have managed to get my stats high enough to place in the top 5 most weeks on my team. I wrote and had published 2 articles for the self help web site for our employees. And for as stressed out as I was at the beginning of the job, I am already bored. I am hoping to get involved in some projects to learn some new skills and if nothing else, to have some to put on my review.  Home: Ju and I are still hanging out quite a bit and I have been hanging with my upstairs neighbors also.  We have been working on a vegetable garden in Ju's back yard. Today was tilling and a little planting. I am dog tired and finally clean but it feels good to have stuff that is gonna grow this summer.  Freedom: Is doing well, all the tests have been inconclusive or good results so.... no idea what is wrong with him. Perhaps his is just high maintenance. :)   I think that is everything. Things are just crazy busy and I have decided its time to cut back a little on the things I am involved in. I feel too pulled in far too many directions and like I don't have enough time for anything or anyone so its time to cut back some.

      The vet called today.  Freedom's biopsy results are inconclusive.  She left a message and I didn't get a chance to talk to her.  I don't know if this rules anything out.  The only thing I know is that he'll need to have another biopsy done from a fresh sample site.  They'll take the biopsy from an area that has the lesions and healthy tissue side by side.  More info when I get it.  Just keep him in your prayers.

      Things have been status quo for the most part.  Yesterday we noticed that Freedom's pads were literally coming off of his feet.  Took him into the vet, she is running a biopsy on the tissue.  We should get the results Tuesday or Wednesday.  She thinks its either his allergies in really heightened form or Systemic Lupus.  Say prayers for the silly mutt please.

      Sometimes....  I get overwhelmed by the amount of choices I have.  I get frustrated by my lack of drive, focus, determination, stamina.   I want to give up, hide under the covers, run away from you all.  I want to stop feeling like I am always *on*, unable to break, not allowed to be down.  I think of living as a chore, a way to kill time, a form of entertainment for God.  I think that death is gift, a vacation from the montony, a freedom from feeling.  I can understand why you run, silently screaming, so far far away from me.   I want to fade away, quietly, invisibly

      There just isn't much to update on.  Things are calm.  Things are good.  Work is good, I'm bored already but its still good.  Freedom is good, the 2 mile walks every morning are helping take some of the weight off of him (too bad the same can't be said for me).  I'm working on a few different freelance web design projects and as much as I try, the flow of creativity seems a little stifled.  My mom is going to Utah for a month next week to help my aunt after she has surgery.  The garden is growing very well.  This summer will be fun with all the homegrown veggies.  I honestly, just like knowing that something I bought in a little packet is growing and sprouting because of the work I put into it.    In other words....  My life is boringly wonderful.  :)

      I got into my truck today to leave for work.  Started it up and heard POP and then smoke came out.   Its at the shop. It had issues a few months ago and I had to have the transmission modulator, hoses and the radiator replaced.  It is doing all the same stuff as it did then.  Needless to say, I am not thrilled with the repair shop but because they did the original work, thats where my truck is.    Then as I am waiting for mom to show up, I stood up from the brick ledge I was sitting on and hit my head on their sign.    Yeah, not going to work today.  Gonna deal with the truck and keep praying that everything that is wrong they don't charge me for.   On the flip side, I have an awesome boss and he was WAY cool about me not coming in.

      Not much is new....  work is good.  I am doing well within my department and I still enjoy what I do.  How things are so different from my first call center experience. Freedom is still doing good and life is just in general well, boringly wonderful. I have settled back into the corporate world without issue.   My latest review reads:   Shannon,  What can I say? Awesome performance! Your AHT  (average handle time)  is really low, which would normally worry me because it might mean that you're not giving the customer enough service to be thorough. However, I see that your ACW  (after call work)  time is also REALLY low (it's included in AHT), which means that you're talking and typing and this contributes to your low AHT. Also, in call monitoring, I haven't noticed you giving customers poor, or rushed service. Just be sure not to over-focus on indicators, so that you don't burn yourself out.  I'm so glad you're on the team!    Hope everyone is well!

      Things are mostly good.  Work is good, home is good.  Missing MA a lot, he moved and while I know the intent was there, he hasn't kept in touch.    Mid-year reviews at work are going on, its hard to believe I have been here almost 6 months.  Seems like forever and only a short time all at the same time.  Praying a raise comes my way.  I love my mutt but he is too expensive.

      So since the whole break up lat year, I have been hesitant to really want to get involved with anyone.  My heart had been broken and well, my and Freedom do just fine on our own.  And then I met a new guy.  I like him, quite a bit actually.  Lately I have been missing the relationship I had.  Not the man I had it with per se, but the relationship itself. I miss loving someone in that *awe inspiring, tummy flutters, light up my life* kinda way.  Not to mention I miss being loved that way.  aside from all the BS and deciet, that relationship was great in that area. If only for that reason alone I cannot regret that relaitonship.  It taught me a lot about being loved and loving someone else.  I don't know what's gonna happen or even anything will happen with this guy.  I'm just glad that I finally feel ready to move on from the last one.

      Back then... So when I was around 12 or 13 I started babysitting for the Ab family, M and K (the kids age 3 and 4), S and Ka, their parents were in Amway with my mom.  It was an easy $10 a week to baby sit for a few hours on Friday nights.  I did this until I was around 18 or so.  Every Friday night I would get there around 7, play games and do origami and crafts with the kids til they went to bed and I watched tv.  S and Ka were the parents I wanted.  They listened when I talked, they were interested and they wanted their kids to have every advantage in life.  For high school graduation, S built my first computer.  A 386, which at the time was the best of the best.  I broke that thing and had it fixed so many times I lost count.  That's what got me started in computers.  Bought a DOS book and thought things like fdisk and dblspace would be fun to try.  I got into the Grateful Dead, they got less active with Amway, the babysitting became less and less and I moved and we lost touch.   Presently... When I started at Intel I remembered S had worked there and looked him up.  He was still there so I shot him a "Hi, Remember me..." e-mail.  I never got a response and never really thought about it again.  Thursday I was walking into work and saw someone that looked somewhat familiar although I couldn't place the face exactly.  Then he started talking to someone else and I recognized the voice.  It was S. I said his name quietly enough that if it wasn't him, I wouldn't be humiliated.  He turned around and I did the "Hi, 'member me".  We talked and it turned out M was graduating that night from High School.  He invited me to the party yesterday as a *surprise guest*.  We had lunch Friday and got all caught up and made the plans for yesterday.  I showed up yesterday, completely nervous, second guessing if the kids would even remember me.  M opened the door, no recognition at all.  I asked for his dad and he went and got him.  As I was walking out in the backyard, Ka saw me and instantly recognized me, BIG hugs all around.  Then K saw me and did the same.  It was so good to be there yesterday.  Ka and the kids reminded me how much a part of my life they were and I theirs.  They have a third child, Pa, who is 7 that I got to meet. I was reminded of what an integral part of my upbringing they were.  It was Ka I told about my first kiss,  I confided in about the abusive boyfriend and the kids that kept me sane through it all.  We promised to keep in touch and I have no doubt that it is a promise that will be kept.  It was total God thing in each and every way.    As for the lake..... Well, J from work (not my other Ju) and her boyfriend R, invited me to the lake today to hang out and enjoy the sun.  Freedom and I got there and we were all enjoying his enthusiasm, and being that they are also both sober, the soda and water.  There were 2 single guys next to us with jet skis and then on the other side, a group of 18 or 19 year old.  About 4 guys and 3 or 4 girls and their bulldog.  Well yeah, there is a leash law in place but neither Freedom nor their dog was on a leash.  Freedom goes out to the water and back to me and that's about it.  He listens and comes when called and has never gone through anyone else's area.  Well, I wish I could have said the same for the bulldog.  He came tromping through our stuff, leaving water and sand on our towels and we ignored him.  I must say though when he lifted his leg on R's truck, we were all irritated and angry.  R told the guys to get their dog out of our area and back on a leash.  They did... for a short time.  Then the dog came back, this time to lift his dog on R's trailer.  So R picked up a handful of pebbles, tiny stones really and threw them near the dog to try to get him to leave.  Well the jerks next to us start yelling about Rick throwing things at their dog and this asshole picks up a rock the size of my hand and throws it at Freedom.  I yelled at him to knock it the f--- off and he picked up a larger one and did it again.  I lost it at that point, I jumped up and ran over without even stopping to think.  OK, I am a girly girl.  I don't know how to fight, I don't even know how to throw a punch other than what me and Billy Blanks practice with Tae Bo.  But it was Freedom and there was no way I could let anything happen to him.  The kid shoves me, knocking himself over in the process, R comes over to grab me and go after the kid and then the single guys came running over.  They were yelling at the kids, R was yelling at them, J had Freedom by the collar because he was coming to protect momma.  It ended about there other than smart remarks, dirty looks and the like.  I'm not really proud of my reaction, yet... its Freedom and my reaction was far from thought out or planned.  It was a knee jerk reaction.  One that if it ever happens again, I hope I am better prepared for!   Work...  Is going awesome. I got a review last week and all are pleased with me, my performance and my skills.  I pretty much have a world of doors open and I just need to figure out which ones I want to go through.  I got a lot of compliments and it was nice to be able to talk about some of the issues we deal with just in the working environment, not necessarily about the work itself.  I think that if I stay on the track I am on right now, I have a very good future there.  And best of all, tuition reimbursement kicks in next month so I'm goin back to school.  For what yet, I dunno but somethin!  :)

      Good weekend if not a bit quiet.  Hung around the house, did laundry, played with the mutt, the usual.  Went to a birthday party yesterday for 2 year old twin boys.  Lots of laughs and kisses there!  Worked in the garden a bit and just in general kept to myself. My feelings have been hurt by a couple people and I know when it is more than one person, there is something wrong with me.  Regardless, they are still hurt and I am licking my wounds and trying to analyze myself.    Yeah... Shannon wrapped up in her own head is a muchly scary thought.

      My new phrase of the week. Hey, its better than Oy Vey.  Well, let's see here.&nbsp; Work has been good.&nbsp; Boring, but good I suppose. I wrote another script for our department, I'm ranked 10th out of the department and my peers like me.&nbsp; Imagine that.&nbsp; And what's more, we have a person on our team that is well, perhaps lacking in social skills.&nbsp; Or maybe its a matter of not wanting them.&nbsp; Regardless, when they moved him behind me, I decided I would make friends with him specifically because I did not like him.&nbsp; And we made friends and I found out he is a cool person.&nbsp; Well, his social skills or lack thereof, have gotten him into some manure with management.&nbsp; Oh how I remember the days.&nbsp; The conferences and meetings being told&nbsp;I was inappropriate, out of line, unacceptable, etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; It wasn't so long ago that I had an awesome manager that told me these things.&nbsp; I remember too the feeling that even if I did improve, all anyone would see was who I used to be.&nbsp; And that was the case and may be the case for him here,&nbsp; thankfully I don't know.&nbsp; My conferences have been nothing short of praise for my attitude, my willingness to help and my overall *perkiness*.&nbsp; Gag me.&nbsp; I am   NOT   perky. Well, maybe a little I guess.&nbsp; So the problem child on our team has now asked me for coaching on when he is out of line, sarcastic or inappropriate.&nbsp; Me? Really?&nbsp; Wow, a few years ago, no one asked me for anything like that.&nbsp;   Its amazing what a little recovery, a lot of God and fresh chance will do for someone like me.&nbsp; I am actually well liked here, not out of fear but because... they really like me.   So bizarre how things change.

      The last few weeks have been so busy and yet so just, well, ordinary.&nbsp; It's been nice.&nbsp; Work is good, I am rated 10th in our department (out of 62) for my stats (call time, volume, resolution, etc) and I am rated first on my team (14 of us).&nbsp; Not bad for only being there 6 months!&nbsp; Mid-year reviews are coming up.&nbsp; I've been told by my supervisor that I have nothing to worry yet of course I am still anxious to hear what he has to say. And while I am not first in our department, of course my head tells me I should be.&nbsp; One of the things about working in a call center is that so much of my performance is based on concrete numbers.&nbsp; Number that while I may not agree with the formula for calculation, because everyone is based on the same formula, there is no denying the good or bad in them.&nbsp; Numbers of course aren't the only measurement of success there but they do play a hefty part.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My reputation at work is such a far cry from what it used to be at Apple.&nbsp; Same work, same environment (in a sense) so its easy to compare the two.&nbsp; Apple was my first corporate experience.&nbsp; I must say I was pretty hard headed about learning how to work and play nicely in that type of a setting.&nbsp; I had an awesome supervisor though and when I got out of line (which was often) she told me.&nbsp; As much as I hated to hear it, she was always right and because of those lessons, I am where I am today.&nbsp; The supervisor I have now is a gift from God.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; He used to be a pastor so its nothing for me to ask him to pray for me if I am having a bad day.&nbsp; He *gets* that a long with a ton of other stuff.&nbsp; He can read people and their reactions and know where they are coming from.&nbsp; He understand my need for perfection even while disagreeing that I should be perfect.&nbsp; He understand that all of us are human, subject to all the stuff humans go through.&nbsp; Its been a great experience there.&nbsp; And I seem to be on track for a good career there should I keep my current actions.  &nbsp;  I have requested information to go back to school.&nbsp; My company will pay for it, I need it and I want it.&nbsp; Of course, I am scared to death to think of it but I think it will be good.  &nbsp;  Freedom is still Freedom.&nbsp; Ever wondermous and my best friend.&nbsp; His allergies are in full swing but other than that, he's healthy again.&nbsp; He's losing the weight we need to get off of him and each pound we lose, I get another couple minutes added on to his life.  &nbsp;  Home is good.&nbsp; Our garden is flourishing.&nbsp; We have all kinds of tomatoes (at least 3 different types), squash, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, corn, Chinese eggplant, green beans and bell peppers.&nbsp; Some we started from starter plants, some we planted from seeds.&nbsp; Its just amazing though.&nbsp; Its so cool to go out to the garden and harvest stuff and then eat it knowing that it was something we grew.  &nbsp;  So.... work is good, Freedom is good, home is good.&nbsp; Not a whole lot to complain about these days.  &nbsp;  And that feel great.

      It funny how you can be going through life and then WHAM! someone from your past comes back to the present and everything gets all topsy turvy.  Anything emotional relating to them all comes floating to the surface.  Somewhat like an Exxon oil spill in the heart of the Alaskan waters.  Oily, dirty, smelly and foul.  Nothing good can survive in water like that.   I have lots of people in my life that I don't keep in regular contact with but are still in my heart.  Some going back to before I was a teenager.  The relationships survive, without a problem, us not talking for months and months.  When we get together, its like no time has past, quite comfy with the relationship.  I have others that for whatever reason (usually bad) are no longer in my life and contact from them is unexpected, scary and foreign.  I don't  like  being caught off guard.  I don't  like  being surprised.  I don't  like  the unknown.  And I  despise  being conflicted over how I feel about someone as far as like vs. dislike. I like knowing what is gonna happen next, I like consistency, I like stability.  Mostly though I like knowing where people stand in my heart at all times.   If someone rips something away from me, be it a dream, a fantasy, something material or nonmaterial... I fight to keep it.  I fight until my knuckles are bloody from hanging on to that thing for so long.  And then once I am worn out, tired of fighting, I accept the loss.  Usually not gracefully, usually not without a whole lotta tears.  But I do get to the acceptance part.  I can't unaccept that defeat just because someone wants to return what they took away.  At that point I all the fear of losing it again come flying back up.  Flying up like a blender with the top off on full speed blending tomatoes juice and milk.  It's just not pretty and its truly gross and way too messy.   I'm at the point of fear and hurt and anger and sadness.  What could have been, never really was and what I lost, I never really had.  Wouldn't taking it back then mean that I was backing to holding on to something that wasn't mine and wasn't real?  Sort of like trying to hold on to air.  I've looked over this ledge before, I think I need more than just air to stand on.

      Got up went to church, came home, took a nap. Naps alone make it a good day.   I invited my mom to the church picnic/ 4th celebration last week. Dunno why I did but I think it was a God thing. We had a great time. I was in charge of the Bounce House *wicked evil grin* for the first couple hours, managed to go on *big kid* Slip-n-Slide twice. I quit after hitting my face on the ground. Ouch! We had a BBQ, great worship music, Ju and her friend La and her kids and well, basically a bunch of kids I know and love were there. Had a great time with everyone. TONS of fireworks at the end.   Basically a mmmmmmmmm yes, good day. :)  Happy 4th Everyone!

      I have a case of the "F--- it" syndrome.  Lyrics that haven't appealed to me in quite some time are appealing.  My birthday is coming up and while I can usually rattle off a list of things I want, this year I had a hard time figuring out what to put on an Amazon wishlist.  I feel bad, my mom has been asking me for weeks what she can get me, but at the same time *f--- it*. Its just a birthday. Another year gone by to signal the fact that I have down little to nothing with my life. I dunno.  I care. Yet, I don't.  Screw it.  And screw them. I would say I am apathetic towards my life but I'm not.  Its not a case of apathy, more like a case of ambivalence.  I'm tired of it.  I want to run far far away where no one knows me, the problem though is not my surroundings but rather the problem is me. I burnt out on being me.  I just don't wanna be me anymore.  I would be perfectly content to not exist tomorrow.  I know this isn't a healthy feeling.  So I beat myself up for it.  Then I beat myself up for beating myself up. Which leads to a desperation of wanting to not be me.  So you see, my life is not the problem.  I am.   Its difficult to live in the skin of someone you don't like.  I try to be perfect and good.  The perfect friend, coworker, employee, daughter, pet owner... it just doesn't work. Yet, knowing the issue doesn't seem to fix the issue.  Talking about it grants me frustration from friends, rather than understanding.  It grants me weird looks, wide berth and pats on the head with the words *That's normal*.  F--- it.  I don't want to be normal.  I don't want to be me. I don't even like me.  Work is good.  I have a new project administering the log in ID's for our call consultants.  I am assisting in developing the training for a website our department will use and I am on the  Great Place to Work  team. They like me.  I do well there.  The structure, the distraction, the focus.  What do they see that I don't?  I just don't get it.  So I dunno.  Anyone have a brain they want to trade?

      Saturday morning I went and picked up K.  (I've known K since she was 8 months old, she's now 15.  She came back to my place, watched Uptown Girls while I picked up the apartment and then she, Ju and Ju's nephew E (age 10) and I walked down to Old Sac, ate caramel apples (a first for the kids) and wandered around.  Came back, BBQed and then the kids came back to my place to watch Dickie Roberts.  Ok, that movie was so funny.  I normally don't care for David Spade but it was way funny.  Walked E back to Ju's around midnight and then crashed.  Got up this morning around 8, made breakfast for K, and then we headed to church.  They were doing the water baptism today at Goethe park and it was way cool. While at church, we picked up V (age 19), the daughter of one of Ju's friends and she and I got baptized.  Her reaffirmation, the first time for me.  After that we ate lunch and headed back here.  K had to be home by 4:30 so V, K and I drove out to Antelope, dropped K off and then V came back with me and we watched In America.  Weird but good movie.  Very strange though. I dropped V off around 8:30 and I am headed to bed shortly.    I'm beat, Freedom is worn out.  Off to bed we go.
