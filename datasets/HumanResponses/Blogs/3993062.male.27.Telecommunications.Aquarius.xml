       &nbsp; We, quite often, in the midst of a busy life ignore or rather do not pay much attention to certain simple facts of life. This is about one of such things.........DISTANCE , Yes DISTANCE - A simple term (or a physical atttribute) that I am sure, we deal with everyday, either directly or indirectly.  Ever wondered why we MISS people when they are separated by DISTANCE. Even though the LOVE is still the same, the feelings for the person are still the same, we still miss the person. We await for the distance to be reduced to the minimum possible and that person to be in your arms. Your heart longs for the distance to be eliminated. Even when you know that the person is going to be back you still are feel the distance, feel the separation, feel the isolation. Is distance such a powerful force.&nbsp; Even with such great advances in science and technology ( I know I am kinda sounding like our physics teacher in school pleading with students to take part in a scince fair)  I thought looking at how Distance affects other physical attributes in life might give me an answer to this self-created (as well as experienced) puzzle. I started asking questions to myself. Well .....not many.....so bear with me :-)  How does distance effect something as powerful as Fire?&nbsp; Well..The farther you are from the fire, the less effect of fire and less warmer it is.. Hmm...well Distance does effect FIRE.  How does distance effect Sound?As we all know..the farther you are from a horn (or even better to understand, a shouting partner :-)) the better it is for your ears. In other words yes it does effect Sound.  How does distance effect light?Again, the larger the distance, the more difficult it is to sight an object. Even the all powerful force of light has to kneel down in front of the MIGHTY DISTANCE.   So does distance decrease the actual/absolute intensity of these physical forces/energies? Ofcourse NOT!&nbsp; the intensity (at the source) is still the same but we DO NOT FEEL the same intensity bcoz of the DISTANCE.&nbsp; Applying the same logic to LOVE (for a person) and distance.........Eventhough the intensity of LOVE is still the same for the person who is far away from you, you miss that person bcoz of the very nature of DISTANCE - THE DEMON. May be, we do not "feel" the same LOVE and warmth when the person is far away from you and our body percieves that change as MISSING SOMEONE. Interesting right :-) Well may be not to everyone reading this but to me........ It is (Remember.. I live in the rainbow ;-).    "If you cannot avoid boredom, enjoy it, analyse it"  &nbsp; I believe in this statement&nbsp; and&nbsp; Life is boring without&nbsp;HER around! I tried analysing it. Now I have nothing else to do. I MISS&nbsp;HER more! &nbsp;

        &nbsp;   Just came across this   Quote   ( A collection of words, uttered by a Mr.Nobody, forming a meaningful sentence (sometimes NOT so meaningful too :-) that become popular more often than NOT after Mr.Nobody's death, there by turning him into Mr.Somebody) while browsing away in one of those KKB (kaam ke beechme ke) breaks. This one&nbsp;is about CHARACTER.

       "Aquarius is the eleventh Sign of the Zodiac, and Aquarians are the perfect representatives for the Age of Aquarius. Those born under this Sign have the social conscience needed to carry us into the new millennium" &nbsp;-  urlLink www.astrology.com      &nbsp;   If I come across as a person obsessed with sunsigns, I would blame it on sheer coincidence. I have never really dwelled into these rather amazing, interesting and mysterious sunsigns ever (the exception being my&nbsp;college&nbsp;&nbsp;days wherein every&nbsp;other guy, me being no exception, &nbsp;would loiter around the junior sections pretending to be the "know-all proxy linda goodman" guy :-). Well coming back to the point.....I never realised that I had such a BIG responsibility being an aquarian....     "Carrying the Humanity into the next millenium"...Can u beat that?   &nbsp;  Well, if NOT anything else, this statement did make me run a self-reality check in order to figure out what in the world I ( read aquarians ) possess that will help me achieve this. Well.... My Reality check bounced ;-) (Yes Chots it did). I know I am gooood ..But that goooood..hmmmm..even&nbsp;at my self-obsessed best&nbsp;I guess the answer would be in the neagtive. I decided to find out more about&nbsp; Moi- The aquarian .

       Sisters  are always there for you, and no matter what they always care. Sisters are there through thick and thin, and everything in between. Sisters protect you from the darkness, and make the world full of happiness. If you are sad and you feel like crying,sisters are there with a hug to lend. They are there to gossip with and laugh with, and you may even utter the word 'sis' Sisters are your strength when you are too weak, they are your voice when you can't speak, they are your crutch when you can't walk, they are your shoulder when you need to cry, they are your ear when you need a friend. Sisters share a love with you that no other could compare to Sisters are your link to life, they are the ones who stand beside you through the hurt and the pain, through the tears and the rain. I now know one thing,  Because of you, I will never be the same.     - Unknown  Chots you are the best Sis. Happy Sisters day!!  A very happy friendship day to everyone out there!
