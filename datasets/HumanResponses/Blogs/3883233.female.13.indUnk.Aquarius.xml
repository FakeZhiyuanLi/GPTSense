         Well &nbsp;Angie is over and my mom comes in and says there wont be a rec soccer team. Now you are like big deal a rec soccer team what is "rec" ne ways. rec is where oyu dont have to try out for a team any one who wants to be on one is on one.&nbsp;but if there arent enough players then there is NO team. adn if there is no rec team then i dont get to play soccer this season. for the simple reason of windy being a bitch. i seriously love soccer its like one of my every things. its always been there for me and now its not. ive played since i was 4 w. ashley. people always ask you what sport you play well i always answer soccer and track (but i didnt start track until 7th grade) now what do i say..? my mom wants me to do cross country but i cant even run a mile, ok i can run it but its not fun and i would rather not run like 5 miles at 5 in the morning. but seriously i thought i was gonna just cry when she was like there isint gonna be a soccer team&nbsp;b.c i serioously cant find any thing that im good at that goes year round. track is just like 4 track meets at the end of the school year. but w.e screw it.

       So today angie comes over, ive told you about her, and so she has this guy pal she met on the internet named jared, and so of course i talk to him.&nbsp; well eventually we call him and talk to him. i just ask him&nbsp;a bunch of stupid questions so i could auctually carry on a conversation w. him. but of ocurse he thinks im "a lil weird' him and his lil albama accent, w.e he thinks im a freak, and you know something i bet alotta people think that, especially their first impressions of me. but w.e screq him. so also tosay as i was on the phone w. buster makin a date for tommrrow we just start talking about what ever and i decide to tell him every thing about me that no one else knows. its not bad stuff but just minor details that i dont tell people, like my left boob&nbsp;is bigger than my right, i even have some hairs on my nipples, i dont think i have a G spot (and if i do i cant find it) i some times sleep w. no underwear on, i love walking around naked (except for my small chest size), that i reall ydo use crest white strips.&nbsp;just stuff like that. but ne ways i think i should be more real, more myself.

       so for the last two weeks i have been at a camp, FUN FUN!! and i come back and i have this V-ball camp to go to. well i suck a volley ball so i wasnt having fun with all the preps seeing how much i stink so i come home and tell my mom i dont wanna go for the rest of the week and she can get a refund. she doesnt really care about the money, just the fact that later on peopl ewill think of me as a quitter (i dont think they will even rember, but w.e) and so she makes this whole big deal outta this lil thing and i think its b.c she knows it makes me feel guilty. but w.e i didnt give in. so then she wants me to clean the living room, so she will take me to the mall tommrow. even though practically everything in there is camerons. but other than that my last few weeks have been good. except i bet you i gained like 10 pounds at camp. my friend there calle dme annexeric and so then i started stuffing my face at every meal. and im not the type of person who throws up (ive tried but i just cant). i am getting fatter and fatter. well i bet you hate hearing about me being fat. i know i hate it when my skinny (or fat) friends say how fat they are and when fat girls say there fat you cant just agree with them&nbsp;and your just stuck and dont know what to say. but my friend ashley cox&nbsp;is really skinny but she always&nbsp;complains that she is fat, when&nbsp;she is a healthy looking skinny. gosh she just gets on my nerves&nbsp;when she says stuff like that. &nbsp;so i go to my hair person today. not only do i hate my hair when its straightened b.c it never stays and it looks bad b.c its so short i dont like it curly b.c its so thick. so today i get the usual highlights a small trim and i ask her about thinning my hair but all she does is just chop off some of the end hairs. so next time ill REALLY get it thinned. today at the store i decided that i had yellow teeth so i got a pack of crest white strips. omg i hate them they are really gross feeling and just eww... so i advise you all to just brush your teeth good and NOT get them. but if it floats your boat ten do it. So i was reading this guy taylors profile today and it had a page in for ashley (the one who thinks she is fat) saying how he thought he loved her and how she dissed other people and how she thought she was perfectwhen she really wasnt. all that an di thoguht it was weird b.c true she did put people down but to me it seemed she thought she was the opposite of perfect who was fat and had a big nose.&nbsp;but then it said she wasnt the person he thought she was. and i was thinking how perfectly i could relate to that. i thought i loved spencer but turns out i must have had a mask ove rme b.c he was not the person i thought he was and i only thought i loved him, though i wanna make out with him just to know he kisses. thats just b.c we went out 8 times and i told him alotta stuff that i would have rather told gregg of jimmer. an domg jessic ais the biggest bitchy liar ever she has my capris and i want them back so i called her and asked if sh ewanted to spend the night and she said she couldnt b.c she had been out for the last five nights. and she has just&nbsp; been totally annoying me lately. well as it turns out last weekend my old soccer team went to this tournment (windy the biggest bitch b.c she said 3 outta six would get a spot but then every one BUT me got a spot so w.e) and at the tourny they lost EVERY single game they played, and me and my mom were talking about it and she goes "part of that was your fault for gettin your self kicked off the team b.c you showed your ass" and i was like w.e she is a bitch for not putting me on the teram and you know it after all she put me through last year and i still wanna play for her an di bet im better than alotta the girls on that soccer team an dits not my fault that she got her self a sucky team. o0o and good news last year in the camp play (lion King) i was scar (the evil guy) and this year s play (Allidian) i was Jafar (again the bad guy) so yeah that pretty cool i like playing the evil people.

      Well i have (for the zillionth time) come to the conclusion that EVERYTHING is just plain (putting it nicley) FUCKIN SCREWED UP.. ok now that i have that outta my system.. so jessica calls and says that i wasnt her and she never called me. i say what ever i dont think it was you i think it was you lauren and some one else she starts tellin me her call log bla bla bla.. on she goes.. "i have to take a shower. call you back." and i hang up. then as eric is talking to me on IM he is just being his normal sexy self.. just kidding eric if your readin this ;-) well any ways i have this camp tommrow and my family wants to have break fast together (thats a first, wait MAYBE a second)and if you eat breakfast together they expect you to eat and if you dont enjoy eating then what do you do..? im at a loss for what to do.. EXCEPT i can stay up late tomnight and sleep in! im a genius! well i bet youre wondering why every thing is so screwed up.. me too becasue all of the sudden im in a GREAT mood!! so i take it back if you just read this well you probaly waste dlike 5 minutes of your time b/c there is NO point in it. but do you know that thing where you change moods in like 3 seconds..? and you are liek crying. well i think that i have a minor case of that. but any ways so i went camping with jessica and lauren for spring break and this girl named shebly (idk her very well) and so on IM she goes do you like me..? and i dont really wanna be her friend or any thing but she is not mean so i say yea and then when i say that i rember the time when we (jess lauren shleby adn me) were sopposed to be sleeping but we were playing truth or dare instead and we said some thing that made lauren REALLY mad (we were at lauren house when this happened) and so she grabs a pool stick (that i was pole dancing on for a dare) and slappes shelby adn starts chasing jessica with the pool stick. we were freakin out and she was cussing all three of us out an dthen she is threating to go down and tell her parents and blah de blad bla.. doesnt that show what a NICE and good friend she is..?

      So today i go to check my voice messages and there is one from a no number. i expected it to be a prank call from lauren and jordan. but instead it was jessica and some one else. and the person sounded as if they were trying to be a boy and they were just saying the GAYEST stuff (you couldnt really understand them) and you could hear jessica in the back ground tellin the person what to say. then at the end of the message jordan (i think) says fuckin retard. and so i decided i wouldnt get mad or prank her back. i just called up jessica and in a boys voice i say hey jessica its taylor. then in my regular voice i just say ok jessica what ever im not gonna be your friend ne more ill go find a new BFF. or wait a new "good friend" as you told lauren we were only good friends. besides i screw up your life and your clothes so BYE. and i just hung up. NOT expecting her to call back (which she hasnt) the reason i said the part about screwing up her life and her skirt is because we had this fight adn she was like you make my life more screwed up than it already is and then we had this other fight b/c she has this jean skirt and it has lil strings hanging off it and one time i was wearing it and she was like talyor go cut off those strings they make it look bad and i was like i think they look good but then i went and cut off the strings. so about a month later she calls and was like Why DID YOU CUT OFF THE STRINGS FROM MY SKIRT and i was like umm becasue you told me to.. rember? so she goes OHH YEAH THATS WHY YOU TOLD ME YOU CUT THEM OFF WHEN YOU WORE IT TO SCHOOL and i was liek what ever you told me to and you were at my house when i did it. but as we are talkign about her life being screwed up i would like to ponit out that im the one who has divorced parents but that live together and i didnt even know they were divorced until about 3 years ago and im the one who doesnt eat and cuts her wrists. but what ever jessica.. i just wanted to write out on the internet how we were hardly BFF b/c we NEVER told each other REAL stuff. we just tell who we have a crush on and that stuff but when i need a shoulder to cry on i go to one of my guy BFF they know me for who i am

      As I saw my cousins last week my younger cousin (kelsey) showed me this website. as always i go tinterested in what she was doing and i asked her how to get one of my own. as anyone would she showed me how to get an account adn all that. so that brings us to today. but whats the point of reading any thing that i have to say if you know ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING about me..? first off im going in 8th grade (WOW) i have a few best friends.. Cody and Cody, Jimmer, Spencer, Gregg(ory), Sara, Samantha, HAiley, and Jessica. Tho me n jessica's friend ship is a bit Unstable.. about two months ago jess adn i got in the HUGE fight with my ex best friend lauren adn jordan. me jess adn lauren were together EVERY single weekend for about 4 months. we knew lots of stuff about eachother that could easily be used as black mail to oneanother. and lauren was also friends with jordan even tho she ALWAYS talked about he behind her back.. so then this one night jess is over adn jordan is at lauren house and me and jess call them adn ask them why abotu a week ago they called me and told me that jess hated me. they denyed ever saying that she hated me(even tho they really did). so OF COURSE that started the whole BIG fight we were comming up with the MEANEST come backs ever thought of. Lauren and Jordan both looked liek thery were annexeric adn had the FLATTEST chest in the school and so we were showing that in there faces. but jessica isint skinny but she isint fat she is short adn she has a LIL extra stomach so they were calling her fat and me a slut even tho im NOT a slut cuz the farthest ive gone with a guy is making out(how is that slutty..?) Laurens SN is BlondeFLirter29 so we were making up things like: BlondeFaker29 and LesbianFlirter29 b/c she died her hair blonde and she has NEVER had a BF so we call her a lesbian. adn it just went on and on forever adn then my mom came in and saw the WHOLE thing an dso we told them my mom knew about all of this and she was abotu to call laurens mom adn when we told them that she were BEGGING for forgiveness. it was great. we were just like WHATEVER and then jessica decided that she would be friends with both of them agian (im NOT EVER gonna be there friend agian) so now they ALWAYS tell me stuff about jessica saying stuff abotu me and so there fore me and jessica are HARDLY friends any more cuz about 2 weeks after the lauren and jordan thing we had a fight adn she was saying how her life is screwed up adn mine isint when really mine is MORE screwed up than hers.. she gets every thing she wants a horse a cell phone they get a new house is she would just be nice to her mom maybe she wouldnt think her life is SO screwed up. she ALWAYS yell sat her mom adn i knew that if i tried that (i have) then in in HUGE truoble. i mean its SO much eaiser to just sit and not listen to my mom yell at me. well any ways off that topic b/c every thime i think about that i seriously wanna go kill them.. even jessica my SO CALLED BFFL
