      ~This is a note by the author, Lesley Richards.  An odd setting for a story, I'm sure, on Blogger.com, but I figured what the hell. This will be a story written by a fifteen year old sophmore about her life in general. It's like this entire blog was written by her, except for this - and this is me. The real me. My main character, Ginny, is only a snipet of me, who I'm going to agonize and dote over in this story. Called Orion. You'll see why.  Do read. I'll post soon.~

      Ug. Just woke up. They watched Spirited Away, thank GOD, but I fell asleep like within the first fifteen minutes. No offense to the movie, of course, I was just really sleepy. Turns out everyone else was too, so I didn’t get pranked. My party anyway. Well, not completely. Emily and me’s birthdays are like a week apart so we always just have this big one at her house (check that, actual house, not apartment. Rare for Houston, but Emily’s filthy rich. I mean, this is River Oaks. I feel afraid to touch the carpet, really.) and this year was no different. She gave me a diary - you! I don’t know, nor do I really care, what Orion actually looks like, because that’s what I’m naming you anway. It’s because you’re black and velvety and very soft, with little fake crystals on you spread about in random order, but at your bottom right corner the little crystals spell out the word “Diary.” You are a diary, my diary, but you’re also Orion, because I want to call you that, and because I will. Tomorrow, I swear, I’ll go to Hobby Lobby and buy some of those little fake crystals and form the word “Orion” in your velvet sky out of diamond stars. And you know what? There’s nothing you can do about it.  I’m Virginia Elanor Kirby, but you must call me Ginny or you shall die. Nice to meet you too.  Breakfast is served, it seems. More like brunch, but whatever - it’s nourishment.  12:40 pm  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Just showered. Happiness is warm water, shampoo, and coconut conditioner.  Mum says hi. Accosted me about my presents. Says I must make a list so I can send thank-you notes. Sure. Can do.  Emily - Orion; light-up pen (v. cool); Barnes and Noble gift certificate ($30! Score!); black t-shirt that says “6 x 9 = 42” (I’ll explain later); and a gel-pen pack Yvonne - $25 g.c. to Hastings (Score again) and 2 Happy Bunny stickers (‘your anger makes me happy’ and ‘cute but kind of strange’ - so me) Clair - very cute p.j.s ; blue slippers with floofy yellow star; and black nail polish. Wench (Becky Sue; but call her that and she becomes dragon-like) - Evanescence cd (they are too cool) and two pairs of socks (I love socks) Katy - black cloak from Ren. fest (awesome beyond belief) Vanessa - $25 g.c. to Barnes and Noble and a beautiful black rock that has rainbows in it under the light  There. Done already. Now have to write notes. Bleh.

      ~this is the beginning of the story. odd, I know, but work with me.~     Am too freaked to write right now. Typical. I finally get a diary and I’m too scared to form coherent sentences. WHAT WAS THAT? Oh. God. Going to kill Emily. We just watched The Ring, see. I’m the type of person who can’t watch Jurassic Park  without seriously freaking out. They’re saying we’re about to watch South Park. Never seen it. Mum totally objects.  3:16 am  South Park was very good. Very funny. Very, very, VERY rated R. Must remind friends NOT TO MENTION the movie in front of mum. The Ring, too, ‘cause it was definelty rated R also.  No way. I just looked at the case. Rated PG-13. The ratings board were on crack when they watched this. The Ring is so incredibly R that it’s not even funny.  Extremely sleepy. But they want to watch Spirited Away. Either that or Gothika. Must convince them to watch Spirited Away. I don’t think I could handle any more horror.
