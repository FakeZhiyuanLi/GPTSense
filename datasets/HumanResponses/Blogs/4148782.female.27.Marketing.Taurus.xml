       They say that lack of sleep contributes to an unstable metabolism, therefore causing it to slow down...I don't know how true that is - all I know is that I find it increasingly harder to function on lack of sleep.  Sign of old age, maybe?  I don't know - in college I could stay up all night and just be a bit batty the next day - now I'm practically incapacitated.  *shrug*      Anyway, the past few days have been miserable - I wanted to lob off everyone's heads.  But after an awesome prayer service at church on Sunday night, I finally feel like I'm going to be okay.  I was able to get up this morning and spend time with God, but because I didn't walk, I was REALLY groggy.  That could have something to do with going to bed at 1:00 am, though.      I'm heading to Hampton University tomorrow and Wednesday for a grant workshop.  I'll be staying iwth my friends Costa and Victoira Gerousis in their new house in Williamsburg.  I'm excited to see it because their family told me the house is gorgeous.  I'm excited :).      Okay...have to do some more work...just a short update :D

       Hey guys - just a short update to let you know that I'm going to be bumbling my way through the news today and tonight, probably.  So tune in to WHSV TV 3 and watch me explain what we've been doing WHILE I'm exhausted, tired and grumpy :).      Isn't there anything good to eat anywhere...I'm getting hungry...

       Okay, it's 10:45 pm and it's quitting time.  I have everything set up for tomorrow and I'm heading home, only to come back at about 8:00 am.  So, hope you're enjoying this!  I'm going to keep it up so everyone can see what's going on in my life...have a great evening and as one of my students used to tell me, "Peace Out..."

      For those of you familiar with Reddish Knob, here's pictures of the beautiful town of Bridgewater and Harrisonburg from atop Reddish Knob, the tallest peak in the area at about 4500 feet.  There's not much up there, but it's beautiful on a clear day or night - we used to go up and watch meteor showers, sunrises, sunsets...and sing...that was fun.  I went up there this past Sunday because it was so beautiful - I'm a nature chick and love to be outside as much as possible!!  Anyway, hope you enjoy...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Okay!  It's been a bit since I've gotten the chance to post, but finally I'm sitting down long enough to do it.  Today has been extremely hectic - I had to travel to Roanoke for a meeting and was planning on visiting and eating with a few friends/family, etc.  But that was dashed when I had to rush back to Harrisonburg and take care of some things for this big event we're having Saturday adn the book bag stuffing we're having at work tomorrow.  Yeehaw - TV station will be there and everything.      You should currently see my office...as a matter of fact, I'm going to post a picture of it later.  It's covered in school supplies...as most who know me can figure, my office is a comlete wreck in the first place - adding about $8400 worth of school supplies in here does NOT help the decor.      Anyway, got back and ran around picking up the donated supplies and have spent the last 3 to 4 hours inventorying (is that a word??) everything to know what we've received.  I will then have to set up all the supplies for tomorrow's packing day. But I can't until everyone from the other side of this job leaves or THEY'LL try to take the supplies. (There's a church and then there's a social services side to this place...I work for the social services side).      And as I type a mountain of book bags just slid to the floor.  I hope those notebooks don't fall or I may not live to tell about it...it's currently taller than me :).      Next I'm going to talk about the struggle I went through today and learned from.  This will be interesting.  While I was in Roanoke, I had a slight emergency that needed to take care of.  No one here where I work knows how to use a computer except for the limited knowledge that my assistant has.  She was not in, she had a baby appointment.  So, I didn't want to try and walk someone through it over the phone because I knew it would take forever.  I asked a friend if they could do the task for me - no, they didn't have time but if I couldn't find anyone else, then they would do it.      I don't like to inconvenience anyone, so I said no, I'll find someone else.  But inside I was frustrated, because I know my tendancy to drop everythign I'm doing to try and help this person.  My pride started bullying up and I was getting upset because I would have done it for them.      But I  KNEW  this was wrong - this person usually tries to help me whenever they can and I was just looking for a reason to get upset - I have NO CLUE why.  I prayed and cried out to God to help me with the emotions I was dealing with, because they were irrational.  I told Satan to leave me alone and Voila! - I was later able to call this person back when they had called and asked if I had gotten the job done, and tell them YES, I got it done.      But here's the coolest thing.  God knew this person would not be able to do what I had asked because it ended up taken a person who worked here with me to straighten out a problem that came up.  Yes, it took me a whole hour to explain to someone how to get the document onto a disk and take it where it needed to be, BUT the problems that arose were easily solved WHILE I was still in Roanoke because my assistant came in and took care of the rest.      God is awesome in His workings, and my brain knows that, but my heart never wants to trust it.  You see, immediately after I praised God for helping me with that situation, knowing that he wants me to rely on HIM and not on the people I ask for help, I began to think, " Well, God only cared about this person's time and that's the reason He worked it out the way He did. He knew it would take up all of this person's time with the problem and so He didn't let Him say yes.  "  Isn't that awful?  Satan is TRYING to keep me convinced that God doesn't love me and He won't take care of me.  So I just have to keep fighting these thoughts and Satan.  But it's NOT easy.       I am REEEAAALLLYYYY tired - so I'm going to go out and get some fresh air and then come back here and get everything ready for tomorrow.  Please feel free to comment with your own experiences, because I'd LOVE to know I'm not the only one that struggles with being petty and imature at times :).  If I  AM  the only one, then oh well...

        Another picture of Santa Ward - Had to share this one with you all! He's on a bike in an old empty Wal-Mart Building. I work for a local private social service organization and we hand out toys at Christmas time and this is the toy shop we set up...Ward is delivering one of the gifts *grin*...     urlLink     urlLink

       Yeehaw...today has been an interesting day so far. I woke up and went walking, and SO enjoyed the weather. We have a cold front moving through thanks to hurricane Alex, and it was in the 50's or 60's this morning. I love this weather - it makes me want to skip directly to fall, which is my FAVORITE time of year.      We're out putting "Tools For School - School Supply Distribution" Posters up all over the city of Harrisonburg. My co-worker can't find a babysitter and to help him out, we've been taking his 4 year old daughter with us (in a car seat of course). She keeps getting confused because Sarah Deavers is the Volutneer Coordinator/my assistant and is driving me to put up the posters...so it's Sarah and Sarah. It confuses everyone, really, because we're in the same office. But she's married and pregnant. BIG DIFFERENCE.      Anyway, her name is Arianna and she is ADORABLE. I can't wait until I have children :)...      okay, time for lunch...

       JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING - I HATE ASTROLOGY AND PROTEST LOUDLY THAT MY SIGN IS SHOWN - I think it's ridiculous to try to set your future on the creation instead of the one who CREATED it...had to get that out there - I feel much better now.      Oh, and did you check out that cool picture of me on the side - the smaller one? I look like I'm foaming at the mouth *laugh*. For some reason the small picture wants to make my teeth look funny...if you look further down, my teeth actually look pretty normal...ALTHOUGH...      I'll let you in on a secret...I whitened my teeth in photoshop essentials - I drink a lot of moutain dew (I'm trying to quit as always) and my teeth bothered me in the picture...so I photo whitened them ;). He he he...aren't computers handy?? >:D

       Okay, so it's time to give a bit more of an explanation.  You see, I'm one of those unfortunate people who can't leave things alone and simply analyzes things TO DEATH.  I think through situations and come at them at all possible angles to figure out what could possibly happen so I'll know exactly how to react.  Rantings of a control freak, right?      Well, I'm finding that in the things I participate in my life, they either lead to life or death.  Physically, I can go out and drive my car at insane speeds and ram it into a tree (don't you ever feel like doing that some days?).  That leads to death.      Other days, I go outside and take a walk to excercise, or I decide to eat vegetables from my garden or something silly like that.  That ultimately leads to life.  Healthy life.      Well, I'm finding that it's the same thing in my spiritual life.  I can do things that bring me spiritual life or spiritual death.  And sadly enough, I find myself choosing the spiritual death more often.  Like the Apostle Paul of the Bible mentioned, I do the things I don't want to do and I don't do the things I want to.      Take tonight for instance - I don't want to talk about any of my friends business because I don't want them talking about my failures and pains - a common courtesy thing, you konw?  Don't kick a dog while it's done kind of thing.  And yet I saw someone and started talking about the latest failed marriage.  I don't want to spread those people's misfortune around to others - they have enough to deal with right now without me going on about it.  But I did it anyway.  I still can't quite figure out my motivation other than it was my evil twin.  *sigh*      So what remedies that?  That's what I've been trying to figure out.  I know spending time in God's presence will change that - I can't change anything on my own - only He can.  But that still doesn't make it any easier,  you know?      That's where the title comes from.  I'm spotting life, so to speak, and sharing it with everyone else.  If you see life in what I'm saying, tell me.  If you see death, tell me.  I need all the help I can get! :)

       Hello! This spot is under construction. It was created in a mindless effort while at work. Yes, I should have been doing the growing list of things to do, but something about the rain and the chocoloate/peanut butter brownies I brought in today caused me to stray from the ultimate task...that and the attraction of a DSL line compared to my Dial-Up at home :). So sit back and join me - I'll have things in order soon enough!

       Now, this of course, is a test, also - it will be easier to email from home because I don't have a DSL connection there, which I already posted before.  So bare with me until I get myself up and running.    THANKS!
