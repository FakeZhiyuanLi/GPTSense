      (click title for pictures) Well, that was quite a cool way to spend the morning, a little trip out through galatea, te teko, past a couple of hydro dams and back to Rotorua.. along the way we came across an interesting sight, in lower Galatea there was a group of around 20 horses with riders, all dressed up in ridiculous red coats , out for a hunt, complete with poochies, so if thats vaguely interesting for ya, head off and have a look at the pictures. One of the dams had a huge crane called 'goliath' that was on rails the length of the dam, giving it the ability to completely lift a gate for repairs etc.. quite impressive to round a windy corner and be confronted with this monolith of creation.. a big spider of girders and bolts, quite a feat of engineering. Caused me to think a bit about NZ, and iraq and the inevitible running out of resources... not a lot of NZ realise that a good chunk of our electricity comes from renewable resources, mainly geothermal and hydroelectric - this puts us in good stead when you consider that the USA has a little over a days use of petrol/coal in its own reserves, and relies so much on external sources that -will- dry up... unless they keep declaring war and claiming oil reserves - but thats a different rant alltogether. We should marvel in the good decisions our predecessors made to invest in Hydro. We rock. and we'll be enjoying microwave meals long after america has hit apocolyptic energy crisis - hoorah! but then, its america - so who cares! right? Beautiful evening settling in upon us, and the extremely 'small town' takeaways we had in te teko for lunch didnt quite hit the spot, so I'm going to cut some nice big slabs of corned beef, batter them, and call it dinner. Allblacks versus Argentina tonight, watch the scrumming and backline passing. Might post again before bed. Ka Kite Ano, ake ake aue.

       Current song playing   [ Eurythmics Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) ]  Well, it's a nice clear day, and we all know Rotorua is of er.. limited entertainment value, so smokey and I are off on a road trip, up through the backroads in the as yet unnamed lil blue mini. I feel the urge to name it something smurfy, but I think he'll kill me - bahaha. Ahh well, whenst I return I will posteth pictures of aforementioned trippage. Then you can all 'ooooh' and 'aaaaah' about just how swanky my photography is, a'aight? ..And I'll also tell you the tragic tail of cornedbeef gone badÂ©  That's all for now sportsfans.      www.happytreefriends.com  - Todays link.

      As is the tradition on a Friday night, when I'm in Rotorua, me, the old man smokey, and my Grandmother get together for dinner.. it's quite cool, because my gran is kinda like granny off the Tweety n Sylvester cartoons.. just the same, little bit slower, whole heap more hard of hearing, just as sweet tho. I'm cooking a lump of corned silverside (corned beef/brisket) slowly, in the crockpot.. crock pots are great like that, bung it in in the morning, whenever you feel like eating that night, its ready, hot, and tender as. But it did occur to me, a conversation I once had with charlotte about how my corned beef was better than her mums.. in that she at least -liked- mine, now.. she could've just been being nice, but she actually -ate- it, so I'm guessing she was being honest. I cant remember what I added to the meat that time, but I do remember ringing 'mum' and effectively getting her recipe, even then, it didnt quite turn out 'like mum used to make' which made me wonder what it is that give women of that generation a knack to make good solid food - other than being chained to the oven, I mean, my mum worked fulltime most of her life, so she was hardly the 'athomebitch'. As society pushes forward and we strive to squeeze what we can out of the little time we have left after working, things like good traditional home cooked meals are slowly dissapearing, My freezer now has a greater proportion of mass produced patties and fillets and things, rather than good old fashioned butcher meat. These new things cook well straight from frozen, take about 20 minutes, and end up costing about $2 a lump. That's pretty hard to argue with. My train of thought about this, caught me the other day, and sent me to a butcher, a good one, in rotorua, and I got a rolled chicken roast, stuffed with honey and macadamia nuts. mmm gorgeous... well should've been. I tried to roast some potatoes up all crispy to go with it.. and ask someone who knows, I'm a pretty good cook, but everything went wrong.. slicing the cooked chicken it completely fell apart. no real worries still tastes the same.. the thing shrunk like a motherfucker, again, still enough, no worries. The electric frypan I was crisping up the potatoes in kept tripping the power cut out, unbeknown to me, so I'd set them sizzling, tend to something else, turn back.. oil cold. FUCK. reset it, seet them sizling.. etc etc What a pain in the arse. Slightly flowery potatoes, chicken that needed reheating, and soggy vege. Dont -ever- waste time doing things the long 'old fashioned' way, My point for the day is that, if the old fashioned way was worth it, we'd still all be doing it the old fashioned way, new things, might not taste quite so good, but are a decent substitute considering the lack of effort needed, and relative cost. That said, I'm ignoring that, and soldiering on, trying to make corned silverside just like mum used to make.. I'll let you know tomorrow, or later tonight, just how I fucked it up. Wish me luck :D Ciao

      A moment of your time, if you'd be so kind. I'd like to rant about something. Take a seat, and get comfortable. I'd like to have a whinge about optometrists... in particular kiwi optometrists. Until recently there was no legislation in New Zealand that said you had to be an optometrist to dispense contact lenses, only to diagnose vision deficiancies etc. This meant pretty much any Tom, Dick or RajaMo Sahd Fahtgna could sell them,  The advantage to the seller was pretty much cost price contact lenses. Woohoo! This meant contacts with an optometrist RRP of $140 per 3 pairs, were available at less than half that, $60 for 3 pairs. So we're getting -quite- screwed on price, because somehow they dont make enough charging $53 odd dollars for an eye exam they -demand- we have every 6 months or they wont dispense to us.. like trying to get medicine without seeing a doctor. Which brings me to my second point, if I want to change to different, cheaper contact lenses, I supposedly 'need' an exam, to test the new lenses on my eye, which negates wanting the cheaper lenses because the $53 exam is more than the difference between the cheap lenses ($90) and the ones I get now ($140)*angst* On top of that.. the same lenses I wear, are rated in NZ as 'monthly disposables' That means, after a month, I should throw them away 'for the sake of my eyes' and use a brand new pair... except, the exact same lenses in a less afluent country, are rated  bi-monthly disposables... perfectly safe for two months, says my optometrist... so why encourage the majority of us, to flick perfectly good stuff prematurely - oh wait.. I think I know this one.. PROFIT. So in conclusion, dear optometrists .. ROT IN HELL YOU FESTERING MONEY HUNGRY STINKMONGERS!! I BITE MY THUMB AT YOU! -sigh- Donations gratefully accepted 06-0266-0080503-00 (National Bank) Current balance $3.60

      Bah. It's cold as hell out there.  I love grocery shopping - I'm not afraid to admit it, I guess I love any form of spending money - but yeah, theres' always been a strange appeal to grocery shopping. There are conditions to this claim, however. Read on...  Busy supermarkets are horrible. I hate crowds of people at the best of times when I'm trying to -do- something, shopping etc.. like st lukes at xmas time - absolute shit. Supermarkets are the same, but worse, because stupid 'left it to the last minute' people, are so erratic with their trolleys.. either erratic or just plain stupid. It shouldnt take a lot of thought to be able to navigate a trolley around a supermarket, it really shouldnt.. but in the defense of people that cant, trolleys do sometimes play up, and the grocery store does stick silly display stands up in the most congested places just to fuck with your mind. Assholes. Ram that fucker down - how happy are they with their placement now Dr Ropata? Exactly! revenge is yours... which brings me to comment on things that ammuse me while I'm shopping. My favourite is Yoink n Sploink. Huh? Yoink n Sploink my good friend is a game you too can play next time you're at the grocery store. It is a game broken up into two parts, we'll start with Sploink... To score a point, you merely 'sploink' or put an item of undesiredness ie sardines in tomato sauce, or pickled trotters into an unsuspecting persons trolley, without them noticing. This scores you one point, if you can do it, without them noticing. You get a bonus point if theres a comedic value to what you've done, such as weight watchers items in a fat persons trolley, or tampons in the trolley of a guy that looks like he'd never met a real life female face to face. Trust me, this is more fun in groups, at a 24hr supermarket. Maybe if you've got a digital camera and are brave enough, you could document your game, if you do I'll put it online for ya - maybe we can make it a competition. Hmm I'll work out a prize. Ok.. the other part of Yoink n Sploink, is 'Yoink'.. as the name implies, it is very similiar to sploink, except you take something random -out- of the unsuspecting persons trolley.. the more vital, the better a yoink it is. Things such as toilet paper are my favourite.. imagine Mr Husband getting home after being all stressed from his wife - sure he'll forget something, and an argument ensues about 'did you remember xyz?' he swears he did, but just cant find it. That'd get you bonus points. Anyway.. I look forward to hearing any stories of things you manage to think up - there are probably a hundred variations I havent thought of.  And the post title? express lane? well.. I wanna know why express lanes always go slower because of some mental retard infront of me, than a standard line? is that just murphies law? Motherfucks.  Peace out.

      Well gather around children, and I'll tell you the story.. A long time ago in a place far far..oh wait, I moved back.. hmm.. try again A long time ago, in a place, uh.. here. A long time ago. Back when I was in highschool.. this 'internet' thing started getting quite popular, in Rotorua we didnt have many local BBS's to call , so our modems were relagated to $5 weekend calling people around the country to play modem to modem games. Nerds. But I digress, I started using the internet sometime during my 6th form year, when wave internet launched in Rotorua, and shortly before Voyager started offering internet in rotorua. Back then, 36k dialup was the same price as 256k dsl. Madness. There was a glitch in the voyager sign-up cd, where you could link out of it to browse the web without having an account.. that was leet.. but anyway... IRC.. I started on irc after my still good friend john showed me it.. back then you could list the people online, and it'd take like 10-15 minutes to list EVERYONE on IRC, and back then there werent a thousand different servers.. new zealand had its own server.. and I think it was all dalnet. There werent many kiwis online, and if there were, they were probably pencil-neck geeks.. and quick as a flash I learnt that spading american and dutch chicks was largely a waste of time, unless they had the money to come visit me. My first nickname on the internet was Kermit_ with the underscore because someone already had kermit. Ahh well.. the underscore came to represent all sorts of deeper philosophical enhancements to the name.. I used to hang out in a channel called #nz.. everybody did.. it was the done thing. The first person I met from IRC was a good looking blonde teenage girl called Kate, who lived in tauranga.. about an hours drive from rotorua.. they turned up (her and her friend) to meet me on new years eve.. and sadly I'd already committed to going away to stay with a couple of my female friends in a caravan, at a beach. Nevermind. The second IRC people I met, werent untill later, till I'd moved to auckland, to st heliers to be specific. The first Auckland IRCr I met was ..a cute blonde teenage girl... are we sensing a trend here yet? by the name of becky, who lived just around the corner. Her friend amberleigh, was also hot.. I'm getting off the track here.. um.. MyOldSock... at school in 7th form some of the guys were being dicks and phonetically sounding out their names with other words.. like Kyle Spiers became My Old Pliers.. when I came to pick a new nickname, that stuck in my head so I went 'hmm, cant use -his- that'd be unoriginal, so I changed pliers to sock and tada.. boring huh? since then I've had all sorts of deep philosophical reasons that I've told people, to either hook up with them, or impress them. It's great.. now I'm world famous on irc, cant possibly change it aye? cept to maybe SlookyDMC - which is the letters reorganised.. courtesy of MiJiT, from #auckland on the undernet.  Chur.

      Anyway, I wake up at the unusual time of half past midday (gah.. what a lazy bum.. thats 12 hrs sleep.. nutz) And I decide to go across to the dairy and get some bread n crap to make myself lunch/breakfast, and to get some more diet coke with lime (wtf? well if you haven't tried it, its a far cry from the obnoxious liquid that is lemon coke - try it, its quite nice.. almost as nice as my diet drink of choice - peppymacks) where was I? oh yeh.. so I get half way across the road, and the parking outside the shops is swarming with cops, like 4 cop cars, and about 8 dudes.. all like manhandling teenage guys in school uniforms (interesting because the school uniforms were also dark blue/light blue) so it really looked like cops hassling cops with school bags.. interestingly too  (but maybe less so for rotorua) the school kids were bigger than the cops. Anyway.. I couldnt make out what they were saying, and its a bit obvious to stroll into the middle of it all and go 'whats happening?' so I went and got my supplies and had a chuckle to good ol' Jai my indian homie that runs the 4square. I came out and walked along the front of the shops to..er..go to the..laundromat that isnt open yet? yeah thats it.. and inadvertantly walk right past the cops talking.. they're just radioing in the car as being stolen. No big deal, no big drama.. why the fuck did they need 4 units and 8 cops to recover a stolen car, and book the occupants? judging by the smell and fuckedness (yes thats a word) of the car, I'd say it had been evading the cops.. and as the uniforms make the kids from the school over the other side of town.. they'd chased them a fair way. Damn that I didnt see them pull up.. come to think of it I didnt hear them either.. ahh well. Blame winamp. That's the story. Anyway, this is where rotorua differs to auckland.. the car these guys stole (assumption) was a 92 facelift subaru sedan, non-turbo.. white. Rusty as fuck. Probably worth about $1500, and get this.. it had a set of chromies on it, probably from some nice Auckland car, worth about $5000. I think Rotorua is where all aucklands' stolen stuff comes to be sold off, and redistributed - on that note, let me know if you're after anything - I'll hook you up nig-GUH! peace out.

      I'm hard on Rotorua, possibly too hard a lot of the time because it really is a beautiful place.. so long as the sun is shining and you're surrounded by good people (because the people already here are CRAP! get away from me you backwater hicks!) Without being too specific, I live at the base of the gondola hills.. if you've ever been to Rotorua you'll know roughly where I mean.. if you haven't and you don't know what the Gondolas are, and the word 'luge' makes you lift an eyebrow in a kinda 'huh?!?!' wtfmate? kinda way - well, then you're stupid. Go away. I grew up in Rotorua, but on the -other- side of Rotorua, the 'remuera' part of Rotorua, called Lynmore.. nestled between farmland and the expansive forest, and on the way to some of Rotoruas' most well-known lakes. Got the mental image? right. That was then... ... now I live in the 'Manurewa' part of Rotorua, where rent is cheaper, and a huge double garage is almost a property pre-requisite. Choice.. somewhere to work on the car. In a lot of ways, aside from being a shitty area, its a good place to live, for me, who is currently confined to 'walking' or public transport (more on public transport later I'm sure)  Across the road , and we're talking maybe 50 metres tops, there is a good 4 Square dairy, a decent enough fish and chip shop, an extremely dissapointing bakery, a hairdressers that seems constantly booked out(?) a pub, and soon to open, a laundromat. Within walking distance, I've got macdonalds, kfc, and about 3 service stations - two of which are 24/7 (even if it is only through a piddly 'we dont trust you big scary man' hole in the wall) The bus into town, stops almost on my doorstep - yet I can still miss it. Wow..sounds pretty good huh? well you'd think that, and I guess it is, except for two times of the day, its a nice place to live.  Between 7-9 in the morning, and between 3-4 in the afternoons, it becomes a very silly idea to try and go to the dairy. You -will- be forced to wait while a 7yr old spends $15 on lollies, picking them 2 at a time, from the kazillion different types they have on offer. Fond memories tho.. uh oh.. heres a 'when I was your age' story - cant help but feel old now.

      Right, so like, it was put to me that occassionally what I say might cause a chuckle a smile or an all out 'milk-comes-out-of-your-nose' kinda laugh, and that I should have a weblog to reflect the absolutely stupid situations I get myself into, so that I can share them with potentially millions of people , who in turn, will laugh at ...me...for being.. a clumsy.. hey! Jojo - are you sure this is a good idea? *frowny face* Ahh well.. I'll stop this 'introduction' entry here, and add todays wee story :) Ciao pandafeatures.

      No doubt a question we've all asked ourselves of many different things - as a race I think we like nothing more than to speculate about how things could've or should've or would've been - All extensions of dreaming, to an extent - nightmares or pleasant daydreaming. What if I won lotto? and what if I hadnt done xyz? Tonight I watched again, a movie that I've loved since seeing it the first time, The Time Machine, staring Guy Pearce.. Basically a late 1800 to early 1900's professor builds a time machine to go back and try and rewrite the events that lead to his fiancee's demise.. This wasn't of so much interest, but the movie as a whole does tackle a few interesting ethical questions, and does follow reasonably closely to a lot of the 'ideas' I have about how life, and time and all those big questions actually 'are'. I say ideas, because that is what I have - lots of people say beliefs.. but beliefs are unchanging, set in stone.. what I have are a collection of what I think are the best ideas that I've heard or thought of, at any given time. These ideas raised in the movie are about the cyclical nature of 'life' that inhabbits this planet that we call home. During the vast travel into the future, we get a great computer generated glimpse at what a hugely accellerated time-lapse film of the world coming to an 'end' so far as civillisation is concerned, before all life is wiped out, or most of, then an ice age, then the birth of a new landscape.. slowly populated by more and more diverse species.. coming to where he stops his journey, and the movie continues. In a nutshell he encounters a variety of human that have devided into castes or sectors of people that are specifcally evolved for the tasks they're required to perform.. strong agile ones for carrying out the hunting through to skinny goth looking ones that talk with an uncanny jeremy irons voice, but are exceptionally brilliant and able to control the minds of the lesser mentally developed creatures.  This movie reminds me that everything is cyclical.. everything.. on a karma level, in that we get back what we give, and also on a global and universal level. I dont think we can alter what is supposed to happen, I believe in the existence of some sort of pre-determined course of events or 'fate', and I believe that everything is worthwhile. Except maybe NZ Idol and reality TV - but I'm getting off the track... There is a quote, toward the end of the movie, that I'd like to stuff up, and get out of context, in an effort to share it with you all, inform those that havent heard it yet, and remind those that have.  "We all have our time machines. ... travelling back in our memories.. and forward in our dreams"  What more do we really need?  Keep dreaming, Keep smiling.. oh and PS. Friends that go to Bali and come back stressing about how their 'tan is fading' are poopoo heads. Yeah you heard me! *pokes tongue out* My feet are cold. G'night.

      NZ Idol, and for that matter, any IDOL 'generated popstars' show irritates me. It's effectively the record companies laughing at the consumer, proving that they can dictate what we listen to, and that they do indeed, for popular music, control the strings. What do I mean? well, on the surface you might think that out of a talent quest type show, a person sang well, that song became popular, so people bought the albums.. that is of course what you're supposed to think, it really goes something more like this: In NZ #1 hits are determined by record sales, that should be a pretty accurate gauge of how many people like the song - right? coz people have to fork out for the cd.. right? Wrong.. in NZ albums going 'platinum' etc, and therefor number 1 hits are determined from album pre-sales. Huh? well, the record company, says to a cd outlet, for example.. planet jack.. 'hey, we'll sell you 50,000 of this ben lame-as cd for $10 a pop, or if you buy 100,000 we'll sell them to you at $5 a pop' - (very simplified concept and figures) and its based on those pre-sales figures that the popularity is gauged. So if a record company wants to, they push the album hard, and it becomes 'number 1' because its number one it gets played on the radio lots, because its on the radio lots, people start humming it, singign it, or attaching signifigance to it because they fucked someone while it was playing, or had a picnic, or their dog got run over while they were listening to it, so they buy the cd. Sucker. The record company wins.. the cd's sell through.. and the snowball effect starts. AHAHA thats all very well and good, everyone thinks idol sucks anyway, so no harm done. Right? well no.. this is how normal bands etc work too.. but the fact that idol comes along and does its bit, seriously undermines any other band genuinely trying to cut the mustard -without- the support of a large corporation. The sollution? MP3s. More often than not, if cost is removed from the equation, it all comes back to music you appreciate for the right reasons. MP3's put new talent and new music freshly at the door of the people wanting to listen to it.. it's the closest thing to an emerging band being able to make their music as available as a legend like say metallica, that has ever happened. Fucken marvellous. Download a song, save musics soul. Watch 'School of Rock' (Jack Black)and when idol comes to your city or town, stone the bastards to the ground, especially ben. I hate him with a vengence, he's a girly white black man, with faggy hair. That's about all I've got to say, tho I am reminded of something else someone said on the subject.. or rather , i feel compelled to relay the story they relayed...  Jo Cotton, of 'True Bliss' *cough* fame (I use the term loosely) was on the Havoc show, where ex rocker Mikey Havoc was interviewing her about True Bliss.. Jo had obviously thought herself quite smart for having come up with this comment, that takes a dig at Mr Havocs' past , and his old band PushPush - who had a hit with 'trippin' in the late 90's.  "I dont want True Bliss to end up being a one-hit wonder like PushPush"  Bad move big lady. Mikey responded with...  "You wont be anything like PushPush till you've written your -own- song, produced your -own- record, directed your -own- music video, and made it onto the charts without any corporate help"  nicely put Mikey.  Mikey vs Jo Cotton, Mikey wins *fatality*  ttfn Sports Fans.

      Today differs from the one advertised and I am unhappy with my purchase, could I please return it, and get a refund on today, so that I may have today, again, at a later date, with altogether more favourable results? I wake up this morning, with a migraine - I've been having a few lately, I think it is a combination of caffiene and wearing glasses instead of my contact lenses. Not to worry, today I pick up my new contact lenses, and everything will be back to -2.0 clarity. Hurrah. I log in to online banking, and transfer $10 across to a broke friend, and leave myself with $133.. hmm it'll be a tight day. Tasks to achieve today: print out document at a cyber cafe (our printer out of ink) mail document to client, pick up contact lenses, ring up and enquire about stoppage on our fuel card, hassle xtra about hugely unwarranted upload meterage. Relax. IRC, and maybe listen to some music. Having no cash on me, I toddle across to the dairy and get a V (sugarfree) and $10 cash for the bus in/out of town. The bus doesnt come. The second bus doesnt come.. it's starting to get cold sitting in the only shadow for miles, the bus stop. I give up and catch a taxi into town, for the princely sum of $8 I withdraw $120 from my account, leaving about 80 cents, I go to a cybercafe and print off the document and get stung for $8.. apparently accessing a USB memory stick is somehow more hazardous than a floppy disk _b nice one cyberdork. *mutters under breath* So now I have a little over a hundred bucks, I can either buy my contacts, and have no money to get me to next thursday, or put $80 on my contacts and have a fresh crisp $20 note. I chose the later (second mistake) I go to catch the bus home and realise that the new bus company has taken over, and that there are 5 busses of a variety of sizes waiting at the bus stop (normally a max of two) all very fancy, and what seems to be something in the vacinity of 10 bus drivers. Despite this, my bus leaves late, driven by a lady who has sworn 5 times before she sat down... I can sympathise with her day at least. We start off, make 3 wrong turns, and she switches on the wipers every time she tries to indicate.. much tooting ensues from the public confused by her driving.. nto suprisingly. I'll point out that we're in a tour coach size bus too.. not the normal innercity size.. not bad, nice comfort, I make a remark to that effect, and she tells me the new fleet are small glorified vans, and that this is a temporary measure. Ahh well. The fare will also go up a dollar, from $1.60 to $2.60. Thanks CityBus - you fucks. we continue, taking what I'll describe as a picturesque route home.. not the new route that my pamphlet tells me we'll be taking, but one of the drivers own choosing, down some roads really not designed for tour busses, much to the entertainment of the locals, scared we're going to hit their holdens parked on the narrow road. I point out as we drive past my road, that the route is supposed to go down it, she snaps at me, something to the effect of her instructions saying turn RIGHT into that road.. I rolled my eyes, hit the bell, and hopped off - very little extra walking for me.. and a lot of extra driving for her.. you see, you cant turn right from the road she was on, onto my road, bummer.. it'll take her 15 minutes up that road before she realises this, and at that point, good luck to her trying to turn a tour coach around.. its a single lane wide at best. Nice one, bitch. Rot in hell :D I get to my house, most of you will know, some wont, that theres a bus stop right at my gate, three little old ladies waiting for the bus, that at best will be half an hour late. I shout myself my one indulgence to wash away the days hassles, a can of dew.. sit down, fire up MSN and proceed to spill dew -into- my $200 logitech cordless keyboard. Nice! It takes a good 20 minutes to take this puppy apart.. compared to cheap $17 keyboards that you can either throw away and get a new one, or basically take the IC (integrated circuit) off, and wash the whole thing easily. Currently the washable parts are soaking in the tub, and the unwashable have been meticulously cleaned by cotton bud. It wont work when I put it back together, this is a forgone conclusion. I'll sell it on trademe when it doesnt. You have been warned. I rang the fuel card company, no real explanation, thanks guys, that was a good 40 minutes on hold for nothing. Xtra tell me I've got lots of spyware, and thats why I've uploaded 800megs in 4 days.. thats a LOT of user feedback from spyware.. that'd be the same as the spyware doing a live video feed with audio in cd quality, of all the time that I'm awake. Nice going Xtra. Two friends of mine have also noted ridiculous upload statistics.. Roll on the 4th, where I become flatrate. Now I'm listening to angsty bitch music, I've finished the rest of my dew, I've had some lunch, and I'm relatively calm. I dont have contact lenses, I've got less than a $20 to last me a week, and my only pair of non-dress pants, covered in dew, have been washed and are on the line.. thankfully its a fine day - tho, I wouldnt put it past my day, for it to start raining... and as I type this, amanda marshall starts singing 'oh let it rain' - fucken bitch, she's against me too!!@#!@#!@  Still love you guys tho aye *hugs* Where's my A class drugs at? Pz out.

      I got told today by a lovely young lady that I have a unique appreciation for life. I cant disagree, I've always felt like my eyes are 'open' and if you know me you're thinking 'mm the heart thing, the cancer thing.. near death experience.. appreciate life' but the truth is I appreciated being here long before that, actually from around about the time I first fell in love. I learn who I was as a person, and I like myself, I like what I stand for, I like my strengths, and I dont beat up on myself about my weaknesses.. this means I dont wake up wondering what the point is, I seldom get bored, and I have maybe 2-3 'down' days in a typical year. Woohoo! arent I just fucken spectacular!!! ahahha pfft.. it shouldnt be anything out of the ordinary - we should all be in the same situation, because we all make the choice every day, as to wether we're going to be happy or wether we're not. Time is your most valuable resource, asset.. hell, time is what you've really got, thats it.. you cant ever get any more.. Sure, some of what I do with my time some people would consider wasteful,  but I enjoy pretty much everything I do, if I dont enjoy it, chances are you wont find me doing it. If I spend time talking to you, it means I appreciate you etc etc. Life is good. Friends are good, and family is good. I've got all three, so I'm a happy little munchkin. I cant wait to fall in love again, then I'll be just plain irritatingly smiley... and you all, can deal with it, or join me. I hope this aint sounding too Christian.. bahaha.. I think I might spend a bit more time off the computer, and get some of the other things I've been putting off done. I'll keep doing this nightly tho, and I'll reply to emails. Ka Kite Ano.

      I guess helping anyone with anything, as much as I love helping people, is a bit like teaching a kid to ride a bike. At some stage you'll actually need to let go and let them balance, and sort it out themselves... they'll probably fall down, actually - its almost gauranteed, but we all do, and we need to, to an extent, to realise that we dont want to fall down. Down = ouch, ouch = bad, mental note = dont fall down. It's not easy, to set someone up for that fall tho, and it gets harder the more you care about them, but equally, it gets more important that you do. Sometimes, the easiest thing on the person that you care about in the long term, is the thing that seems hardest to do , right now. And so it is, that we learn to let go, first hand lessons are, after all, the best ones to learn - regardless of how many times we 'fall' to work it out.  As someone a lot more philosophical than me once said:  "Our greatest strength, is not that we do not fall, but that we find the strength to rise every time we do fall"  Training wheels off, bandaids at the ready. It's going to be a bumpy ride.  Peace Out.

      We're about due a decent party up in here. I'm not talking quiet drinkies, I'm talking a spewin' laughin drinkfest like the geek parties of old. I miss them.. maybe I just miss the drinking? anyway - speculate about that later. We're about due one. The last party of any decent 'worth' that I remember that was mainstrean #auckland, was the Halloween party @ GIR-s place, at times when I looked up from my frothy beverage I noticed wall to wall people, thick, right up to the gate... this is how it should be. The 20th we threw mag-enta, at Stages on K'Rd was also noteworthy, mainly for the pool and spacey games, but also for the turn out of decent quality people. In short, ima come up to auckland, and have my 21st party I think... the ones of you that know me better will realise I'm way past 21.. but who the fuck cares? I didnt have a 21st party, so Ima do it soon. Value your thoughts on this.  Ka kite.

      Political correctness is absolute horseshit. Not only is political correctness horseshit, it also manages to be simultaneously immensely fucken stupid. PC crap is long past its use by date. We live in a world where we cant call jobless bums and bludgers, bums and bludgers, fags arent fags, homos or dykes, cripples are now 'differently abled' and stupid people arent 'morons' anymore they're some other righteous crap. Fuck it. Ima stick to calling things as I see them. What pisses me off is people that are against one form of prejudice or segregation while blatantly contradicting their point of view on another.. it's fine if you wanna be all high and mighty and say that all people should be created equal, but it wont change the fact that people -arent- all created equal. They never will be either, give or take genome cloning.. but thats a different matter alltogether, right, back to my point.. If you want to treat people indifferently because of 'race' then you also have to be prepared to treat people indifferently regardless of their varying levels of comprehension or intelligence because it'd be just as bad not to, right? Now we also cant treat people differently because of religion, sexual preference , body odour, social habbits (or lack thereof), sexual fetishes, personal hygeine, anything.. absolutely anything.. this ideal politically correct world, would have as all walking around treating everybody the same, regardless of EVERYTHING. It's not possible. if we were being completely politically correct, we'd not treat wheelchair dudes differently to able-legged normal people, so out go the ramps - you can haul your scrawny wasted away carcass up those fricken stairs and act like the rest of us, mr differently abled! or is the solution, that the rest of us should all get wheel chairs, and meet him on his level that way?  Rah. The whole thing makes me angry. I'm wildly intollerant, and unjustly so, I unnecessarily persecute people for being stupid. I admit it. For some reason I think people are more in control of not being a doofus, than they are to say.. not be cripple. I'm ok with my fault. I wont treat a guy in a wheelchair any differently to a guy standing, I might be wrong in doing that, but I figure, its either that or spend my life wrapping everyone in cotton wool. This isnt the deep meaningful rant I was indending on writing, but its at least a vent.. I'll write a more reasoned thought out version later, if I get around to it, for now, I'll cook dinner. Gnight.

       [10:38]   so all the lonely geeks out there can drink out of their favourite irc slappa    Right, so now there's a blog and we all know you love the galleries.. but what else do you all wanna see here? There's a few things I want to add when I get around to it... I've got a few pictures I've 'fiddled' in photoshop that might make you smile, I'll set up links to the homepages I host for other people here on the-g33k.com, probably put some other sock-worthy links to things like strongbad and happytreefriends. There's some girls on irc trying to track down pictures of peoples 'bits' to catalogue and judge, or something, so that sounds mildy amusing, however.. I'm not sure what winning would do to ones self esteem - to be sexually revered amongst geeks.. you'd just kill yourself, wouldnt you? It goes something like this, IRC is infinately better, at most times, than TV. TV, in rotorua is infinately better than going out... unless I can find my swandri, work boots and black nugget. It's not a bad way to spend a cold evening. I could hook up a webcam, but I'm pretty boring to watch, I think I'll put more of a focus on media too.. there's shitloads out there.. someone needs to coordinate it so that we all get illegal copies of what is rightfully,well, not ours, but that we want. And that makes it ok! meh.. till tonight, ttfn

      I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually.. I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, I'd like very much that they'd hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No I'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... but I'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so I think its fair to persecute the inanely stupid. Lets see if I can keep this particular rant to a few particular types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? great.  1) I hate people that chime in after not following a conversation, or listening properly, only to say something ridiculously stupid and / or disrelated. Shut up. Fuck off. Mind your own business. Contrary to popular belief, I do not talk just to hear the sound of my own voice (nb. sometimes I do - just not all the time ;) )  2) you know that saying 'theres no such thing as a stupid question' ? It's wrong. I've heard some very fucken stupid questions, and some ridiculously stupid statements... and people some how confusing one as the other. Gah. DIE DIE DDDDDDDDIE! *breathes* Stupid questions are questions like "are we there yet?"  well, has the car stopped? are we sitting -on- the beach? no? chances are then that WE'RE NOT FUCKING THERE YET! Stupid answers are horrible too... "would you like a tea or coffee?"  "oh yes please" *mumbles* GET IT YOURSELF CUNT.  I guess I take for granted that peoples' minds work like mine, and as such credit them with some intelligence, but fuck man, google , yahoo and altavista arent rocket science, wises.co.nz is a piece of cake - why is it , I feel I can safely say 'you've done it wrong' when someone whinges their house/street/friends house isnt on it. Fuckwits. It isnt rocket science, honest. Maybe if it was tho, you'd blow your fucken self up - now *that* I'd applaud.  I cant understand how some people can continuously be clumsy beyond normal limits like ALWAYS get food on themselves and others, always be the one to get shat on by a bird, ALWAYS the one to get the shaken up can, ALWAYS the one to step in dog turd.. then they get this helpless look on their face sorta 'duh what I do now mummy?' oh for fucks sake.. *beats you with a newspaper*  We all make mistakes, SOMETIMES. We all fuck up, OCCASSIONALLY. Why do certain people always seem to be on their ass, covered in food and saying stupid things? I think I've got it worked out to one nice concise statement...  They are smacktards.  That is all. Goodnight.

      Well, tonight I finished reading The Davinci Code, by Dan Brown, I give it 8/10. The underlying message/theme/symbolism I get out of the book is one of 'balance' something I've long believed myself. And something I've rambled here about before too.. A positive for every negative, and a negative for every positive. Males are not complete by themselves, and females are also, not complete by themselves. It is through our differences with the opposite sex, and through others, that our greatest strengths come. Through gaining the key attributes of both parents, our offspring stand to have the potential to be greater as an indivdual than either parent by themselves was. This process continues, and our species gets stronger, faster, smarter and better looking. It's a pretty cool system.. shame I had to be around when there will still so many goddamn stupid ugly skanky smelly horrible.. sorry I'm getting off track :D balance. I love that someone is stupid, because it is through their stupidity, that my intelligence has value. I thank the powers that be that I'm not -too- hideously deformed.. the balance being, that some poor fuck actually is. Sorry cuz, but it was either you or me, and the better man won. I thank the powers that be, that I'm sitting inside, relatively warm, infront of a computer, with no real 'needs' that arent being met.. the balance of course being that someone else -isnt-. The upside? This poor bastard, the 'balance' to my own existence, actually, its probably a chick.. to keep the 'opposites' going.. on that note probably a black chick. Probably well underweight, to a dangerous degree, thick as pigshit, ugly as a motherfucker, homeless, and really not smooth at all. She probably has never seen a computer.. probably lives in Suddam. I feel sorry for her.. but there is one thing that lets me sleep at night.. in my double bed, all to myself, with all I could ever hope to eat and drink, and more.. while she starves and farts cobwebs.. and that is.. ..that to keep the balance right, she's too stupid to realise how teh_sux she is. Bravo.  It's a good book, read it. Aight? Ciao.

      Well you wont've seen much of me online today, I've decided that my Athlon 2400+ with 256mb Ram will better serve friends of mine, and have 'upgraded' their pc by swapping with them, When you do see me back online it'll be at a blinding 900mhz. I can imagine the blinding effects of that speed already :D woohoo!  John and Barb have been good to me, John as a mechanic has always dropped everything to help us with niggly little problems, I guess this is my way of giving something back... or Paying it forward, depending on how you look at it. If you havent seen the movie 'Pay it Forward' - you should, it's really worthwhile. I walked to town to do todays banking, and walked home, such a gorgeous day in Rotorua - sun shining and barely a cloud in the sky - the wind with just a hint of crisp winterness doing its best to make my badly-in-need-of-a-haircut mop just look worse :D I feel great. Today has been an awesome day. Ka kite ano.

      I've made a few new friends in the last week or so, some particularly cool people - I'd name them, but hey, why pump up -other- peoples' egos - this is about me :D I've come to the conclusion that we gravitate towards those that we consider like-minded, the people that we see a piece of ourselves in (yes ok ok so we also gravitate towards the people we'd like to see a piece of ourselves in.. if you can read between *those* lines) I'm wondering if getting along well with people that we feel we have a lot in common with, is a form of self gratification. Is it odd, that I come across people that I have a lot in common with, in one way or another, on such a regular basis? I guess it isnt if we consider that like-minded people are bound to congregate in similiar appealing environments. Everything in life needs balance, relationships and indeed friendships (being a relationship themselves) are no different.. we must have enough in common with a person that we can find a level to communicate with them on.. you probably have friends yourself that are particular to one or two aspects of your life, and different friends to satiate the whole spectrum of your interests.. you might have online friends that you can bitch about your day with, work mates you can bitch about the online people with, and flatmates that you can bitch AT for not doing the dishes... whatever. The problem, if we can call it that, is when we come across people that are -too- alike, sparks fly, and not 'attraction' sparks, but more the *want to stab them in an eye with a fork* kinda sparks. I met someone online a few months back, that I hit it off with immediately, and the more I found out about her, the more we had in common, almost to the point of saturation. While our minds worked in different ways, everything else was almost identical.. as it transpires through the passage of time, there werent enough differences in the right places.. this can be true of friendships too, I certainly have my share of friends that are strictly 'enjoy in moderation' hell, I'm probably enjoyed in 'moderation' by some of you, but thats how it works. Give. Take. Balance. Sometimes the people that I most want to pitchfork in the head as much as I hate to admit it, are the people I think are too much like me.. or at least that we clash on the wrong levels because we both try to dominate at the same points. Thankfully a couple of these new friends have the same smart ass sense of humour as I do, so while I might still want to poke them in the eye, i'll probably still be smiling when I do. On a more humourous note.. my friend Fuzzy and I have devised a new product that we think will be infinately useful (I say 'we' it's his idea, I'm ripping it off) Basically its a 9v battery, a horn speaker, an LDR (light dependant resistor) and an eprom, wrapped up in a protective casing.  Huh? Well, basically when the LDR senses 'dark' or nighttime, it starts a program on the eprom that randomly picks a delay (0-4 hrs say) and then emits an annoyingly loud and obnoxious noise for a random duration, say 2-25 seconds, then stops, and this process endlessly loops. Fuzzy tells me on good authority, that a 9v battery used in this manner will last a good number of months. The whole unit would be about the size of a packet of cigarettes. Why? Lob one onto your neighbour/enemy/friends roof. How fucken annoying. 4am *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* not long enough to work out where its coming from. 7am *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* 7:45 *BEEEP*    every night.. for 2-3 months.  Well, the idea made -me- smile :D So watch out you fuckers.  Ciao

      There are some things that I think the average person has a 'quota' for, that must be fulfilled.. these are the embarassing things that we all do. Some people more than others, but it is the existence of these things that keep us human. Things like falling over, stubbing toes, spilling things, dropping things.. and getting things wrong... today I was amazed that I'd uploaded 44.5gig via my 256k dsl connection... it transpired to be 44.5mb  yes, I did feel pretty damned silly right about the time that was pointed out.. and yes, I had egg on my face.. BUT I stopped moments before asking a group of people that would've laughed eternally AND stopped before I rang xtra to bitch about it.. this sort of 'save' is a damned good thing. I revell in the chance to do something monumentally stupid, while no one is around. It's like you used up part of your quota, without losing face. I love it. I recall one time, immediately after setting up a webcam in the lounge of our balmoral flat that such a thing happened... I'll retell the story now.. for your ammusement. I have a big old armchair, its horrid, the fabric .. or the fabric that is left, is tatty, dated and generally non existent, exposing the wood and springs that make the chair.. if you've seen What Becomes of the Broken Hearted - its the same as jake heke's furniture in his flat.. anyway, I digress.. its a gorgeously comfortable chair and I keep talking about reducing it to pieces, to copy it, and make other furniture that is just as comfortable.. this chair is gorgeous it has arms that are wide enough to comfortably sit on, or put a plate on without it being balanced precariously etc. Anyway.. in an effort to make it look a bit tidier, I had a black sheet over it, so that it matched the other black furniture in the flat at the time. Awesome. anyway, this one day I decide to straighten up the sheet, and put my coke on the arm of the chair, then sat down, which pulled the sheet in toward the middle, launching the coke into my lap and my god, coke from the freezer is very bloody cold now, I dont want to get the chair wet, because foam etc take a long time to dry, so I lift up my crotch, carefully so as to not spill the contents of my groin  *invisage groin thrust* and lifting with my arms, I spider out of the chair, to the lounge floor and dribble onto the landlords carpet. All the while giggling because everyone is watching live on webcam. Except, they werent.. I was out of frame for the whole fucken thing. Gutted! Even tho I retold this at the time, its not the same without the video footage. Oooh incidently my keyboard is back together, all 1001 bits of it, and as a BONUS I have spare parts left over.. they cant've been important. I havent plugged the transmitter back in yet, to see if it still works, but I'm kinda putting it off on account of I dont think it will. I'll keep you posted. Have fun, and enjoy falling down in private, each time you do remember youve' used it up, so that it is less likely to get you in public. Woohoo. Life is good :D

      It's important in life to look back on the past and gain at the very least lessons, but hopefully fond memories. I was thinking last night.. or into the wee hours of this morning, about something that I thought might enrich your lives a little, that you may learn, from where I have stepped, and choose your own steps more confidently because of that. Read that as 'learn from the old man' :D  A few years back, when I was dressed all in black,  my hair cut long my chin shaved short,  and still at uni, being taught, I met a girl, we got on well, lots of blushing - both shy as hell.  We met online, and talked each night, Then moved to telephone, when the time was right, She had an accent, and had a tan (and a tidy figure - hey! I'm still a man) She was smart and witty, undeniably cute, We got along well, and she liked me to boot.  We started to meet, together in town, We'd go shopping for toys. Weeks with no frown. Things were all smiley, so I asked her out, She finally said yes when I started to pout.  Valentines day started to near, But a friend had a 21st that I wanted to share, They say love is blind, so following that, I left the party early, like a right fucken prat. Got back to auckland, to meet up with her, heart bracelet in hand, to add to alure  Hand made a picnic, to later have on the sand, rollerblading in mission bay, I pictured us hand in hand. dinner at a restaurant, to view setting sun All efforts made, because she was the one.  About to depart, the phone calls to me, I answer, we talk, but she couldnt see, Why cancelling was a big thing, a big thing for me. The busses she said, meant we'd have little time, so was there much point? I simply said 'fine' I hung up the phone, and sat still for a while. No tears. no warmth. no date. no smile.  -end-  The moral of the story? well folks.. before you go putting a lot of time and effort into organising something for someone, make sure they're worth it.. the person that comes across as being a little selfish - probably is. And to this day I think I'd have better spent my time, with my oldest and dearest friend, at his 21st, than chasing skirt. Bro's before Hoes nig-GUH!  cu :D

      In keepign with yesterdays rant about cyclical things, I'd like to reflect on my day a little... I believe whatever good you put into your life you get back tenfold.. and likewise for bad things. Today I shouted the old man lunch, nothing major we both just were in town, and there's this place that does the best fried onion rings.. mmm.. gorgeous... I bought a copy of the Davinci Code by Dan Brown, and a copy of my favourite magazine, and we headed home, after talking to a friend online and lamenting on how Mizone Tangerine had been taken off the market, I go across the road to notice as I'm making my purchase, three bottles of.. you guessed it.. tangerine mizone, hidden on the bottom shelf behind the counter.. turns out its the dairy owners secret stash, so I haggle, and leave with three bottles, destined for my friend. It makes me genuinely happy, to know that I've made someone else smile, or that something I'm doing will eventually make someone smile.. and in that sense I guess I'm doing it all for selfish reasons - because I get as much out of it as they probably do. The other nights apricot and cream-cheese stuffed chicken breasts with a chicken curry pasta was such a success I decided to encore it tonight, with the added bonus of blueberry danish, the last of which I'm about to go and raid as a midnight snack. Awesome stuff.. loving it. My life is simple, but I love it. Good friends, good family, good times. Smiles. And to top it all off, the sun shone. Ka Kite folks.

      I'm a bit late on updating the blog today, er, yesterday *puzzled look* aaaaanyway, I've been happily re-discovering the art of being a dork. Some would argue I'd never lost it, but hey! Mike, a friend of mine has come round for the weekend, we're totally overloaded on sugar, laughing at everything, singing along to bad songs, making up our own words - you know.. being ...well.. being dorks :) and its great fun. I think there really is some truth to being as old as you feel. Anyway, you can just make do with a short update tonight, er, today :D ttfn &nbsp;

      Nyeh of course 'diet' as in, having a diet, diet being a selection of stuff you eat is a good thing, but I'm not talking about that, am I! Diet, as in reduced calorie intake, is a good thing... for me specifically but theres probably a few of you that are nodding patting your bellies and going 'hmmm' First thing I want to talk about is the 'hah, I'm the shit' diet... on this diet, I do what -I- think is best, and what -I- think will be most effective in regards to losing weight. The key? eat less, and make sure what I do eat minimises muscle wastage. Results? 9 days, 5 kg. "but thats unsafe!" oh fuck off.. no more unsafe than being MORBIDLY OBESE.. sheesh.. I'm sure me forcing my body to feed off its stored fat (which incidently is exactly why your body stores fat ANYWAY) is no harder on my system than say, drinking a 40oz, smoking a fiddy bag, and jogging a fricking marathon through snow and ice. In the whole scheme of things starvation is a very bad idea. Why? because your metabolic rate slows, as your body goes into self preservation mode.. also the first thing your body feeds on isnt fat.. its muscle.. oh fuck.. yeah thats right - you kinda need those, unless you wanna be a girly man for ever. Also, some of your internal organs? yeah.. they need the muscle they have to be able to work.. your heart.. yeah it wouldnt work too good if it was too weak. Bugger. Death. So dont starve yourself, this is bad. Sure, you'll lose weight quick, but like, what are you fucken stupid? so keep your protein levels up, to stave off any muscle wastage, keep your electrolyte, vitamin and mineral count high, keep your fluids high to float the toxins from your system, and it wont kill you, try walking instead of driving. That said, I think tomorrow Ima have a pizza, 4 bags of chips, a 1.5 of mountain dew, and lots of chocolate.. ok I'm pulling your leg, but I'll let myself have some reward, otherwise, I'll get pissed off at myself for being a hard task master and beat myself to within an inch of my life. Dont believe me? you bluddy try me!!@#!@ dont think I wont do it! Diet is good. Diet bundaberg gingerbeer, is infact god. This is possibly the diet drink to slay all other diet drinks. This brings my favourite diet drink selection to include: 1) Pepsi Max - caffiene, need I say more. 2) Diet Coke with Lime - oh shoosh, go try it, its actually good. 3) Bundaberg diet ginger beer - It's just plain nice.  I'm eating more fish, egg and chicken, virtually no carb rich foods, ok I stole a chip right outta the newspaper, but hey - yum.  I walk in and outta town, cept for when its raining because I'm a wussy girly man and my shoes leak. I've scored a new phone, due to arrive sometime.. actually I have no idea.. soon I hope - tomorrow would rock, but I'd almost put money on it NOT arriving tomorrow. It's the new telecom 027 flip phone with camera that they're advertising a 'buy one get the other for 99' thing for? yeah.. how much did I get mine for? 699? nah. 99? nah.. free nig-GUH. so like 500 texts a month, game on.  I'm still keepin my vodaphone coz screw getting seen with a flip phone in public.. but this'll mean I've got 3 digital cameras, coz the phone has one.. so I'm like 'hmmm'. My current vodafone is coo' its a nokia 5100, its got a rubber jumpsuit, and is about as close to indestructible as I've seen a phone... hell, I throw it at brent.. hit him occassionally too - yeah, I rock. I thought it was Friday today, rocked up infront of the TV to watch The OC - ahh crap was gunna claim to have intended to watch something else cooler, but like, I dont know what else is on at that time coz I only watch the OC if I'm watching tv on a friday. Gay. And yeah, I pretty much only watch TV on a friday night, on account of my friends all being in auckland, and me not liking the locals - they smell and wear swandris. >_ Tadpole rocks. Listening to 'allright' at the moment, and yeah, its allright. Duh. Oh, yeah where was I - its *NOT* friday. gay. But, on the upside, I got to see this american tv show (mtv funnily enough) where they took a clapped out piece of shit car that wouldnt get a warrant in NZ, and poured literally 20k USD into 'tricking' it up. It was called some shit like 'pimp my ride' - anyway, it did, on tv, what I mock most of the rotorua boy racer fraternity for doing, which is putting several grand worth of kit, rims, and sound system on the equivellent of a rolling hunk of shit. It cracks me up, so like dont -stop- doing it, I need stuff to laugh at , but nigga please.. get some sense. Till then, I'll go get some shut eye and dream about more automatic cars with blow off valves, and my new phone OH JOY! K thx, bye.

      Well as the weekend steadfastly approaches just exactly what I'll be doing remains a point of some contention. All of my Auckland mates that I've bothered to ask are either too broke-ass to come visit, or are otherwise detained ('sif work is a real reason - wimps!) But fate (generous smokey) has bestowed upon me, ample means for whatever I choose to partake of/in. After pricing up printer cartridges, he's left me $200 to re-ink his printer, a photo quality epson, I've since discovered that dicksmith sell the ink cheaper than where he priced it, and low and behold the change that he's told me I can spend, is something in the vacinity of $80 (this is a big deal when you're a sickness beneficiary)  On top of that, because he's undergoing a financial upturn, he has suggested as he will be absent this weekend, that I dont pay rent, and instead have that money as a 'fallback' if I need something during the weekend. Excellent, $180 for the weekend... Sounds pitiful but this is the most money I've had to spend on me without considering anyone else in .. well, a little while :D The downside? I'm in Rotorua where I know next to no one.. other than a few geeks that usually travel across to tauranga for the weekends anyway. Brill. Nevermind, I suspect after all the junkfood I can carry/eat, several dvds and more caffiene than a person should ever consume by themselves without strict medical supervision , that I will care very little :D UNLESS.. that is , unless I decide that I can make headroad into a computer that isnt this 900mhz under-ram'd ..over glorified typewriter.. I admit, I was cruel in that I installed XP on it, it is something much better suited to say.. 'nix, and that xp is akin to making a poor donkey walk up a hill with an army tank on its back. I just wonder tho, if I can stretch my budget far enough to obtain some decent ..as KIT the car would say 'turbo boOst' - hmm. There are two or three pcs here at the moment, a cel 2500mhz 256mb ram, this 900/128, a 666/128 oh, and a 300/128.. ahh what to do. Who knows.. I'm almost tempted to buy fancy bits, then do the mobo/cpu later.. toys are always more fun than just a jump in speed etc. Maybe a new hdd? gah. I might by 180,000 1c lollies. Ka Kite

       An essay I wrote to help a friend   The burden that I bare, I bare alone. Five years. Five long years. Three hundred and sixty five days a year. A third of my life. A third. A third. Every day, the exact same scene, unfolding with an eerie repetition. Every day the exact same movie playing over and over in my head. Every day, wishing that I wasnât part of that movie. Every day wishing that it wasnât my movie. Every day wishing that it wasnât my life. My life. Mine. That was a joke.   What part of it was mine? It was his. His life. Not mine. Every day it was his. Every day.   Every day, I manage to forget somehow, for a while, the hold he has on my lifeâ¦ precious minutes where my mind is free. Where I am free. Free. Free that is, until I round that final corner, and realize once more, that in no time at all I will be there, that just like every other day I will have to put up with it. It never seemed fair. As I life my key to the door, and turn slowly, the fleeting hope that today might be different is carried away by the thick scent of strong spices. He was cooking again. He always did. Always. To me that simple act of turning the key didnât just open my door, every day. To me, turning the key was like the beginning, because every day, this is how it started.  Through the widening gap in the door, as I enter, I see him, the same as always, tall.. lanky.. standing in the kitchen, the weak afternoon sun making him seem like a shadow. I thought to myself, that he was a shadow. Just a shadow. A shadow on my life. Maybe I could walk quickly to my room, and find salvation, find escape on the end the telephone. Everyday I hope for that escape. Every day I am denied it.  "I'm so glad your home, come wash your hands and sit down. I made your favourite dish today."  Sighing didnât help, but was part of the routine. Part of my routine.. no, part of his routine. It was all him. Like always, there was no escape. Like always I would mask it with a smile. Endure. Always. Forever. With an oblivious smile there was now, like there always was, every day, an offer to feed me. Feed me. Me! I certainly wasnât a baby, I didnât need to be fed. It made me resent the whole thing more. Resent him more.   "I'm a big girl now grandpa, I know how to feed myself."  Sometimes I wondered if he just said it to annoy me. Belittle me. Giving me a little smile after he offered. It could never be over soon enough, I always ate as quickly as I could, Iâd learnt that. Eat quickly, leave quickly. It just made sense. Every day. Eat quickly, leave quickly. Today was no different. Today was never any different. Ever. The small talk always slowed me down. He always asked. I always gave the shortest answer possible. He never got the hint. The next day heâd ask again anyway. It all seemed so pointless. A waste of effort. Every day. Every day, except for the weekend. The weekend was my bastion of salvation, my calm between storms. The closest thing I had to âmy- time. But even then, as if he didnât get the hint. He would be there. Whenever he could. As close as he could. Always asking me questions, trying to make conversation. Every day. Always. Inescapable. I didnât want to talk to him. I never wanted to talk to him. I wanted time alone. Space. Space and time to myself. Freedom. He was always there.. a choking presence, an awkward obligation. Always.  It was bad enough around the house, but whenever we needed to go out, to go shopping, it was worse. Humiliating. He would always try and hold my hand, no matter how many times I would try to avoid it. Every time. Always the same. Repetition. Never a break. He would never let it rest.  Something woke me. I sat up, it wasnât even two thirty in the morning. I heard loud noises. Sirens. I got up and turned the lights on. I walked out of my bedroom, and saw people in my house. People dressed in white. Almost like ghosts. Beyond them, my Grandfather   on a horrible narrow bed, being wheeled out of the lounge. Who were they? Where were they taking him? I screamed out. I pleaded. Tell me! Where are you taking him? I found myself being wrapped in a blanket as I followed Grandpa, amongst all these people, out to a white van. An Ambulance. The realisation started to sink in.  Everything is so plain, so cold, so.. numb inside an ambulance. I shook him and tried talking to him, but he wouldn't answer, his eyes were only half open. Mine were half closed, and filled with tears. He couldnât hear me. He didnât hear me, he wouldnât hear me. Grandpa, why wonât you listen to me? Why wont you wake up? Wake up and be ok Grandpa. Please. Please.  He had had a massive heart attack. The nurse told me it would be ok, and tried to hug me. I wanted him to hug me. How was everything going to be ok? Everything wasnât ok. Nothing was ok. Nothing.  Few hours later, I was in a room with him. He was sleeping. I heard the doctor and nurse said he doesn't have long. I knew what they were talking about. I reached my hand out, and held my grandpa's hand. "I'm hungry grandpa.. Please don't leave me." he didn't listen to me, just like I never listened to him, and he left. He left me. Just like Iâd always wished he would. I regretted it. How could I have ever wanted him to leave? I didnât want him to leave. Grandpa, stay. You have to. He didnât. He wasnât. He left.  No one cooks me fresh food anymore. No one asks to feed me. No one shows me off anymore. It's all gone.  Those precious moments in my life have are all I have left of Grandpa. The shadow that hangs over me now, isnât his, it is my shadow, my realisation that the smiles meant he loved me. The cooking meant he loved me. Everything he ever did, meant he loved me. Everything. Every day. For me.  Five years. Five short years. A fraction of my life that I can never get back.  I try to replay the days, as they used to be, over and over in my mind as I realise that the burden I bare, is that I never realised, that it was never a burden at all. Ever.

      They say in life we're seperated from one another by a few mere degrees, that is to say that if you dont directly know someone, that someone you know of, will know them. It's a fascinating concept, and one that confronts me daily, reminding me just how small the world is. They say that it isn't so much -what- you know, but who you know, and I think this is quite valid, we all know of people that have been put in jobs, flats and even met there current Signifigant Other, because of who else they knew... I'm pondering at the moment, what sort of party could be arranged if all the people that I know, first hand, and all the people -they- know first hand, were to fan out and pool resources. The last time I put any such effort into a party, complete with planning ahead, was a pretty good success, pool table, arcade machines and a good time was had by all. I'm thinking more of the -human- component at the moment however.. I suspect NZ being the size it is, that it probably wouldnt be too much effort to rustle up some decent celebrities (at least by nz standards) although if someone fronts with Ben Lumis, I will kick them, repeatedly, untill they die. I love parties.. what better way to celebrate life than having fun with your friends, all together with a common goal of approaching alcohol poisoning! Some of you will remember the geek parties of old.. the flat 31 parties and the like. Most of us have gotten a bit older now, so the parties are bound to be a little less incestuous and shocking, but as GIR's halloween party showed, the spirit is still alive and well. I vow here, that once I'm back in Auckland, I'll do my bit to stir up some of the spirit that seems a bit thin on the ground at the moment. I say regular dennys meets, pool meets, waiwera and parties. Road trips, video nights... why not? how many lives do you get. Besides, I'll have one heck of a lot of catching up to do, seeing as I've been trapped down here in rotorua for so long by then :D I'm committing myself to do some webstuff tomorrow, so I'll probably get the 'links' and 'contact' button working on here, and might look at some other bits and pieces too.. that means if you think you know of any things worth linking to, that you should let me know in irc, or via [ comment ] on here. Cheers Ears.. now back to my hackslashbleeddiedie movie, that thankfully has no pies or gooonies in it. Kia Kaha

      No, its not a soap opera.. I dont use soap... you know that guy that 'air dries' on jerry mcguire? well I 'air bathe'. ok, I dont, I'm just bullshitting... but at least you knew, deep down, that I was. I'm wondering at what point peoples tangled webs catch up on them, I'm wondering how many of you have really snowballed a little white lie into something spectacular. Tonight I met a guy, that apparently owned a company a friend of mine owns. Hmm.. thats odd. I was talking to him because a laptop I had expressed interest in buying off him kept changing spec. Thats odd. Now he worked for a different company . Odd again. Then he's self employed and contracing. Odd odd odd!. Then he subcontracts to major companies to do things that they have whole divisions of people to do. Very odd. Then I make a reference to two people that used to run ihug as being 'the brotheres grim' (a fairytale reference, their last names were not grim) and he produces a tracert of 'sirgrim' a fabricated report nodoubt, to let me know taht he indeed knew whoever I could think up to mention. I should've asked him to get me a /dcc chat with god, but alas, I didnt think to ask. This did start me thinking tho, the internet is obviously the perfect place to pretend to be something that you're not, hell a lot of people even use it for this very reason - either subconciously or not, as an outlet to be who they would be if they had fewer inhibitions.. a bit like we do when we're drunk. More outgoing, far less shy, and not afraid to say what we feel. With the exception of ABSOLUTE STARK RAVING MAD PSYCHOPATHS - which will remain nameless, this is fairly harmless.. but when you're going to tell little white lies folks.. at least think about how easy they are to prove or disprove.. do some background.. something, anything rather than just making wild unsubstantiated claims. This reminds me of a story... I was living in Grafton at the time, and happily talking away in #auckland, I think it was probably early-mid 2000. The subject of 'cars' came up, as it so often does and people started talking about which cars they had/wanted etc. This one cunt, soon as I said I wanted a subaru sti was all 'ooh I've got one of those' sure you do buddy, every 20 yr old can afford a performance tuned  last year subaru. Good going!. Then I said 'but for long trips I think I'd go with a mitsi gto twinturbo' same guy 'ooh I've got one of those!' OMFG! grow a brain people! so I decide to ask him a few specifics.. hah! people always get tricked on the details. 'Much room in the back seats of the gto?' I ask.. baiting him.. 'no, fuck all' he responds.. HA! I had him.. gto's dont have back seats! ahahah I was almost upset that it was over so easily. I invited him to come pick me up and take me for a drive in his STI.. funnily enough it was in the 'shop' getting some work done. Sure it was buddy. SSSSUUUUUREE it was. Jackass. Anyway, after about another 15 minutes of taunting, I tell him, he should come pick me up in his GTO, and if he does, I'll shout him a feed. We set a time, he organised someone else to pick up (further proving that he didnt have one - no back seats you see, so where would I sit?!? aye aye!) and he went off line. Everyone had a laugh, then about 30 minutes later, I hear a toot outside, so I got up to see what sort of piece of shit he had, hey - if he fronted up in a car, I'd buy him a feed.. I didnt care.. I was bored and hungry anyway. Well fuck me. It was exactly as he'd said, Mitsi, twin turbo, gto. I had humble pie for dinner right there on the road side.. but we all laughed about it on the way to dennys.. I had to laugh loudly, from the back seat.. which was really uncomfortable..fuck all room. He had the STI as well, the dude wrote BPFTP a program that sold really well overseas, and with a residual return from his company of a couple hundred thousand a year, well yeah.. he turned out to be a good cunt too. hell of a laugh. smart... but dont tell him I said that, he's arrogant too :D almost as much as me. Linux.. I'll be a linux n00b soon as I get a hard drive .. I've got a cute wee computer destined to be the smallest linux box you've probably ever seen. Had some gorgeous Dory fillets for dinner, cooked in a reaaaaaally hot oven, a light crumb baked to perfection. I'm a legend. I think that covers everything? Ka kite ano.

      So I'm still hanging out to know if I managed to hit my goal this morning, when I wake up, its like my very first thought, so I'm plagued, and screwed for thinking about anything else till I rectify this bitchass sollution. Right. Haul ass to the lotto shop, check last weeks tickets, get this weeks, and hardware stores sell sets of scales, w00t. Buy a set, weigh my ass, celebrate having reached goal. Thats was the plan. So I catch a ride with the old man who wants to check his lotto tickets too, we haul into town he mentions once we've left that he's got this other shopping list of shit we have to do too.. ahh well, still beats the fricken bus or walking.. so be it. So we hit hammer hardware first, this stupid-ass rotorua one supposedly the first 'drive through' lotto outlet - like HUH? WTF? yeah, anyway that idea lasted a week, now its just roped off. Good going rotorua. The imbecile that thought that one up had better of committed sideways. Anyway, I'm checking out the scales, which most of only go to 120kg.. now any measuring device that is analogue in nature -generally- starts to get a bit inaccurate as you get toward the top end.. figuring scales are the same and that I'm damn near the top end.. I'm in a bit of a pickle.. so dad comes over all smiley faced - 'the tickets won $54' well thats nice, but like was it mine or his? I'll never know, but have to trust in the old fucker not ripping me off - haha.. he wouldnt anyway.. he pays for the scales.. nice of him, and we head off home. I pop on the jug - as I'd started coming down with a migraine and wanted some more caffiene incase that re-adjusted my balance and let me soldier on pain free.. and I unwrapped the scales and went to weigh myself. Tune in next week when kermit the frog says... Ahh like I'd do that to you pricks.  Keeping in mind I had my jumper on, heavier pants than at last weigh in and my shoes on (anyone smell excuses?) I clocked in at 115kg on the nose. Well, I'm happy :) and that was a week that wasnt without its odd splurges.. as m00kle will testify, I was hardly saint-like with my eating last weekend, and, because I'm proud as hell, I wont be saint-like this weekend. Not that its likely to sustain this rate of weightloss, but, supposing I pull it off being a tinarse, I'll be under a hundred kg by my birthday. All I can say to that is.. Halle-fucken-luyah! The weight is over ;)

      Well, with all the anticipation and buildup wondering if I'd reached my weightloss target for the week, I realise when given the opportunity to check, that the set of scales I was counting on using produce inconsistent results at best. Poos. So no progress in that department.. but I can note that my belt, on its smallest setting, is now too loose. Gotta be a good thing eh? cept that I've gotta buy a new belt. Poos. Wrigleys Extra Sugarfree Drops - Wildberry, are quite nice, just walked to the 24hr service station to get them, freez0red my hand hooves off. But hey. That and some sugar free redbull, I'm starting to think with all this engineered sweetness that my chat-up lines might start getting a little more synthetically sweet, and a little less genuinely sweet.. but cares, because I'll be closer to looking F.I.N.E - right? :D bahaha I'm about a hundred lightyears away from Peter Andre Abs, or Vin Diesel upper body. On the To-Do list tomorrow, I've got to get me some bloody scales, because I refuse to let myself have a few food splurges till I know I've earnt them.. I cant see how eating what I have that I will've done anything else -but- lose weight, but ya never know, the body is a fickle beasty. Oh yes. Mike is off to the snow with his gf tomorrow, and my cheap shitty digicam, hopefully it'll come back with some hillarious pictures of them near-killing themselves in makeshift tobogghans. I'm all for people proving Darwins theory, by taking themselves out in ridiculous ways. I'm thinking seriously about starting the davinci sleep patterns, of 4 hrs awake, 20 minutes sleep, 4 hrs awake, 20 mins sleeping.. etc etc.. cuts your overall sleep time to 2hrs, and productivity goes -way- up.. mostly out of mild interest, to see what happens, if it works etc. I estimate getting very bored, and quite cranky, but I cant imagine it being worse than if I was 'on the rag' ;) My cousin Allan is in town, staying with us, makes me want to write a rant about 'family obligation' but I think it'd roll on into a full 'omg dads side of the family are so small-town' kinda thing, and really they're lovely people, just a little... lost? maybe. I dunno. Not auckland material at least. Allan used to make model planes, he's very christian, has a little asian fiancee, aviator shape slightly tinted eye glasses, lots of facial hair.. always seems to be smiling. I guess you'd have to. Or something. Here's a first for me, I'm looking forward to the rugby tomorrow night.. odd.. but there ya go. Couple of months to sort my car out, for the mini nationals, so I better get sanding :/ I hate sanding.  *whinge* Ka Kite.

       Currently playing:  Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit (crap, but I'm too lazy to change it)  Eaten today:  Peach extra. No sugar added and a foul aftertaste that REALLY lasts  Drinking:  Diet coke -with- lime. Tis good, try it.  Age seems to matter less, the older I get. Time seems to go quicker, the older I get. This stands to reason tho, and niether make me wonder anymore, I've sussed it out. I'm so brilliant, listen to my reasoned explanations, and be awestruck.  Age seems to matter less, the older I get.  As human beings with a lifespan in the vacinity of 100 odd years, give or take, we do the majority of our development both mentally and phsyically, but also emotionally and also the development of our character, in the first 15-20 years of our life. After that period of time, people dont -really- grow a lot, change a lot etc.. because from then on, its' pretty much a case of 'living' with what you've become.. its true, its even harder to alter yourself physically from then on, in regards to weightloss etc.. scientifically proven n stuff. I guess thats why, at 25, I'll happily in a day converse with people that are nearly 10 years younger than me, nearly 30 years older than me, and consider them all my peers.  I dont see someone 5 years younger as being naive because of their age, but instead reserve my judgement of naivity, for those that demonstrate themselves to be that way inclined. Likewise with respect, and judgements on intelligence. Older is not necessarily wiser, and nothing in fact, can be assumed about being older, except that you're...well.. older. Experience? well, no not really, I know some old people that have done sweet fuck all with their lives, and I know younger people, myself included, that have probably experienced a multitude of things that other people never will. In my case, some intentional, some not.  This is more evident on the internet, than possibly anywhere else, on line age truely has become largely irrelevent, I told someone today, that on text based chat, you come as close as you possibly can, to talking, spirit to spirit. Meh, thats a bit metaphysical, but hey. I hope you get the jist.  Time seems to go quicker, the older I get.  Well, this is far more logical , and far less deep, so far as explanations go... and indeed many of you would've long ago worked this out for yourself, but here goes: You have been alive for X years. The older you get, the smaller percentage of your time, a day/week/month becomes. For example, when you were 10 yrs old, a year was 10% of your life. And as such, seemed almost an eternity. When you're 30, the same period of time, a year, is 1/30th of your life, or 0.3% so of course its going to seem like a lot less time. 1 year at age 10, is about the same as 3 years, at age 30. Right. That was easy.  Religion.. it's the biggest business on the planet, a little less-so now than it used to be, but still a very major and very real percentage of people adhere to some religion or another. I've long said, that religion offers a direction, and something to believe in, for those that have not yet learnt to direct themselves, and believe in themselves, and while this is still true, I think religion these days is becomming more and more commercial.  One of the Tamaki brothers, the same family that have enjoyed roaring success in the tourism industry, is the figurehead for Destiny Church.. which, is becomming or has become, a political party.. So? well.. most churches take a collection, or fixed percentage of what each member earns, to keep the church running, churches financially are extremely wealthy, substantial swags of property across New Zealand are still owned by churches and church groups, now with churches having tv shows, radio shows, and things like tshirts, bumper stickers etc for sale, and indeed running for parliment, I just have to wonder where it will all stop - or if it will, ever? I guess it probably wont.. maybe I'm just jealous, it'd be extremely lucrative to start a cult... maybe thats something I'll think about a bit more. Which of you can chant loudly? ;) Most people I've seen that work within the church, drive late model european cars, wear really nice suits, and have an abundance of jewellery.. religion, it seems , pays very well. Who wouldnt love to work half a day, and have a house and car paid for, by the church? I say we all move to our own 'craggy islands' and become priests. The bonuses don't stop there folks! there's also as many alter boys as you could ever want :) j/k Religions aside, I remember a guy from World Vision coming to my primary school to show us a video about starving kids, to promote the famine. He arrived in a mercedes, and had a nice projector, and a professionally edited sales-pitch video. Where'd that money come from? and how much of my famine money actually got to the kids? Sometimes ignorance is bliss.  Innovation. I'm looking at constructing for the purpose of reselling, a small computer that will run in a car, power up instantly, house the biggest of mp3 collections, play dvd's, divx and all your silly little animations, have mapping software, facility for gps navigation, engine management, hell - the possibilities are limitless.. 7" lcd touchscreen, with a fancy 'flash' based website interface, lots of fancy pictures, colour, and graphics galore. You'll love it. A top of the line headunit for a car is over a grand.. actually for around a grand you'll get a fairly decent one, if you want one that has a big screen and plays dvds etc, you can kiss the best part of $1500 goodbye. Mine? mine will be under a grand. More interested now? What if you could irc from it? ahhh now you're interested! geeks. I'll keep you posted, gotta go cook the bacon cabonara to go with tonights sausage casserole. Ka Kite.

        Currently Listening to : RedHotChilliPeppers - Airplane  Current Mood : Fantabulous  Eaten today : Scrummy savoury mince ala Chris  Drinking : Pepsi Max   urlLink http://www.the-g33k.com/phpgallery/Public/fromsanyo8100   Photo fresh off the press..er.. cellphone o_O or something.  Just finished putting dinner on, there's a distinct lack of selection in regards to meat at the dairy across the road, 5 variaties of sausage, 4 of bacon, 3 of ham... nothing much else. I ended up grabbing a bag of Aria Farms Beef Chips.. well, they're solid freeflow beef, and get the healthy heart tick, I grabbed some mushrooms, an onion, and some tomato paste.. and tada we have all the makings of a scrummy beef Goulash.. normally I'd prefer it to slow-cook all day in the magical crockpot of tenderness, but the quality of the beef, and the fact I've slapped that baby into 'high' should mean we're 'sweet as' for target time of 6pm. Dinner must be at 6, on the dot, or smokey does a naanaa. Creature of habbit. He'll appreciate the meal tho, he's a fan of anything even vaguely reminiscent of 'farm food' that is to say, anything 'comforty'. I cubed up a potato or three, chucked that in, and diced the onion and as I was peeling the spuds it occured to me, that the simple design that is a swiss potato peeler, is soo much better than the standard 'kiwi' potato peeler... there's something about the swiss peeler, the angle.. it almost makes peeling potatos not a hassle at all. Almost. In typical 'Chris' fashion, I've managed to make good money in the first part of the week, and am set to 'kick back' for the rest of the week, instead of knuckling down and making -more- money.. finding the balance here is crucial.. I see time being more important than money, but as one of my favourite tracks at the moment goes "money cant buy me happiness, but I'm the happiest when I can buy, whatever I want, whenever I want" I think there's a lot of truth to it. I think money is a magnifier, if you were a good person, with money you'll be able to do more good things, if you were a bad person, you'll still suck arse. Nothing set in concrete for this weekend yet, but this is good, as my washing that was still on the line from yesterday (*groan*) is still sopping wet, and anything social lined up would mean having to get that stuff laundromatted.. although as I say that, to contradict me the sun comes out.. There is hint of a couple of people who might or might not drop in, which is always cool.  I love having guests, even if the house is a mess. My expected visitor this afternoon cancelled, so I found myself with a distinct lack of things to do. Headed off to town and priced up some new toys that I cant decide if I need.. especially as I should be spending the money on doing up my poor wee car.. so that I can tikitour all over the place and come and visit you people. Hurrah. On that note, I thought about doing a pilgrimage tour, just me, and muh lil car once he's up n running, and toddle around nz, staying at backpackers, g33ks places, and the occassional roadside.. I think it'll wait till summer tho, as I'm a hella wuss, and the cold is... well.. cold. It seems this bloggywoggy has spurred some people to inject life back into their blogs, and I've seen at least one or two new ones spring up, that I'm going to take credit for inspiring, even if I had nothing to do with it. Why? Because I can.   Thought for the day:

      Well low and behold my Sanyo8100 arrived today, the interface and everything about it just scream 'telecom sux, cdma is vodafones bitch' but aside from that, its a new toy, and its shiney and as we all know, the shinyness is what -really- counts. It's a flip fone, I'm not a big fan of flip phones... it retails for $699, they're pushing it bigtime on tv at the moment. It's alltogether overly non-spectacular. Why the hell have I got it then? Because the price was right..  This phone cost me precisely -dick- , as in, nothing, and it affords me 500 texts for $10 - which is still a bloody good deal, and 100 free offpeak minutes, so I can call people, and recite blog entries , without it costing me a dime. Sweet. My nokia 5100 still pwns, as the virtually indestructable little bundle of neatness that it is, it has a torch, a radio, a thermometer, calorie counter and db meter. Weird? yes. Cool? yes. I have 200 gigs of storage space now, and am already sick of the piddling speed at which 900mhz and 128mb of ram propells a person, or rather, DOESNT propell a person. Photoshop owns my ram, and I think will eventually thrash my hard drive into an early grave, so I'm off tomorrow to price up some new kit. That is todays entry, ka kite ano. &nbsp;

      The earthquakes killed a family friends' new gf. I didnt know her, so it doesnt directly sadden me, but the fact that he was driving the car, and watched her die does. That to me would be one of the worst things in the world, to sit by and see someone you care about or love, be taken from you. I find it hard watching people go through painful emotional things on tv.. I'm a hella emotive wuss... for some reason its always been easy for me to feel where people are coming from, its a blessing and a curse, all in one. I worry when my friends are sad, lonely or depressed, and usually suprise them by having been the only one to notice, or first to notice. Rah. Anyway, my thoughts go out to him at the moment. My day filled up so quickly with nothing in particular, yet I could've achieved so much more... I still found myself marvelling at how beautiful the sky was, so clear, and that perfect shade of blue that hits about 4:30-5pm... I love life, I'm not afraid of dying, and I'm not afraid of having not lived. Sometimes I forget how fortunate I am. I've set myself a goal to reach, in regards to weight, for friday night, I'll let you guys know how I go, but its to get down to 115kg. Thats all for tonight, something lighter next time, promise. Ka Kite. &nbsp;

      My god, what a depressing episode of.. what was that show called again? oh.. yeah.. the news. Floods in the bay of plenty, earthquakes, fires, war.. Sounds like apocolypse is here folks, did you pack your 8 litres of water? have you got your fire extinguishers - and most importantly, have you worked out how to irc without a phoneline or electricity? We had some madd cool undulating earthy-type quakes today, that lasted for several seconds, and sent all the doggies and birdies in an uproar, and trees and powerlines all swayin n shit.. I like nature, and I respect her ability to pummle me into dust if she so desires. The rocking earth reminded me of how hard my sister and I laughed when we watched from a moving car, oblivious to why it was happening, but frightened people running about madly, and a gentleman fall off his bike like he'd suddenly got a case of 'sux to much to stay upright' I think I was about 7, so she would've been 9 - to us it was just funny... but this has got me thinking, theres a lot of predictions out there about just when and where and how the world will eventually decide enough is enough and erradicate this plague that we know as..well.. us, humans.. people.  I watched a documentary called Walking with Cavemen, it was pretty cool, went through the supposed evolution of man from jibbering ape through to what apparently makes us 'different' and 'better' and special, which is our ability to imagine, or think about things that dont actually exist. After thinking about it for a while I realised that yes, it makes sense that that was a huge thinking paradigm shift, and that it probably is what has enabled us to fuck up the planet like no other species would've ever managed. Way to go us! hoorah. Nature will cane our collective ass, and most likely with cataclysmic resource or atmospheric change.. even tho alien invasion or something else would be totally cooler. Nevermind. I love the scene in The Time Machine, that depicts how this would happen, or at least, how I percieve it to happen, and seeing as this is -my- blog, what I say goes. Right?. Good. Basically we've all noticed the seasons slipping around so that winter starts later, summer goes on longer, and it doesnt take a huge imagination to forecast that if that keeps happening we will inevitibly be summering in what is now our winter, and wintering in what is now our summer.  Understandably this will screw with the animals, the poor unsuspecting bystanding animals, and plants that will all be 'wtf mate?' as they emerge expecting warm tropical weather, and freeze a grizzly cold death. too bad, how sad, never mind. I'm not quite sure how the trickle down effect will go exactly, but I suspect that this seasonal shifting we'll survive just fine, for now... we'll cope, in that it wont wipe us out...&nbsp; I see us having far more of a hand in our own destruction than all that malarky. A swift extinction, by comparison. I suspect the oil reserves in the world will run out. America, being by far the biggest consumer of all things oily, will then have to either, curl up and die, or declare war on somewhere else to get their oil - which is far more likely. Eventually someone will fire the first big warhead, boom, then it will be avenged boom... and before you know it, there's nuclear missiles flying around all over the place, decimating the majority of life... then we end up in a sort of world-wide post-chernobyl apocolyptic ickyness.. barren harsh scorched land, polluted water sources, dead rotting food sources, and well.. mass deadness. Killed dead, even. I often thought, when I was a kid that it'd be 'super cool gee willickers neatoriffic' to have a whole house, underground, n shit.. well, in these circumstances that'd pretty much be gauranteed.. the fall out from the bombs would probably result in a big cloud of fucked up smokey shit artificially blocking out the sun, causing madd snowing and extreme cold... and we'd have an ice age.. thats all good, pockets of people will band together and survive, hell theres probably whacked americans already stocking their bunkers in preparation. Countries landscapes will change dramatically, the waterlevels will change, some land will dissapear, earthquakes will create more islands, NZ was created like this eons ago, a couple of techtonic plates smackin' together and jutting up outta the sea.. hey presto the mountain range that runs down our countries backbone. Neat. Not so neat when it happens in reverse tho, and we're all plunged soggily to our doom. Doom de doooom doom dooom dooom *snaps out of invader zim mode* Yes the world will end, but much like my own life, I realise I can live in fear of it suddenly not being there one day, and spend my time best trying to plan for that time, or I can carry on and enjoy myself and not bare the burden of that stress, which is what I choose to do... you might be different, and if you are, I'll probably be the first person to rack up and offer to join you in your subterranian shelter, humour, after all, will keep you sane. mmm. Anyway, I think TopGear is on prime soon, so toodleoo! &nbsp;

      Normal tradition for a weeknight, at about knock-off time, smokey and bob return home, have a cold one, and a bit of a yarn, and thus concludes the day.  Friday, was such a day, and as I often do I toddled out to wag the chin, have a brew and shoot the shit.. We started talking about the fight for life.. and drifted across to talking about Tawera Nikau and his fight, well maybe that should be 'fight', dont get me wrong I'm supportive of the good this fulla is doing, fronting up and helping those less fortunate in and around his home town of huntly - and lets face it, huntly is more sux than even rotorua, so there's bound to be lots of unfortunates. The fight was referred to several times as an 'exhibition match' well no, I disagree - exhibition means something to watch, this was two friends patting each other on the padded head gear before hugging and walking off. Honestly, it was that 'viscious'... ahh well.. this didnt get us laughing... we started talking about prosthetic or fake limbs.. and there's a new zealand chick that 0wns at the special olympics with her special springy replacement leg (it might be legs, I forget) but the thing doesnt look like a leg, its designed specifically for running, and is made of spring steel, in the shape of a.. well I guess as StrongBad would say, consumate Vee... interestingly, this chick runs as quickly, if not more quickly than a 'normally' abled person. What other personal modifications are acceptable or allowed at the special olympics? and ok, with I Robot freshly in my mind, I'm wondering, how long before biomechanical limbs start emerging onto special olympic start lines? Imagine if you will, special olympic athletes with hydraulic motorized legs, out sprinting the normal athletes by way of bio-enhancement. It's an interesting train of thought.. but we didnt stop there, the mind soon wandered in typical 'having a beer fashion' to swimming.. what if bio-lung boy didnt need to breath for the 20 minute overarm race? that'd be interesting to watch.. how long before mechanical legs for swimming become , like their springed counterpart, more of an aid than a hinderance.. and we have jet propelled freaks sconning all the records under the sun, with the help of their part-robotness. Ph33r. But did we stop there with our postulation? oh no! of course not. I suggested maybe Squash player with arm missing, has a detachable arm for normal use, that he switches in true 'hot swappable' fashion, for an actual racket, hard mounted into his arm. Bob liked this idea, and we contemplated decathletes with an accessory backpack that'd make computer game characters blush, with different attachments for each of the ten sports or things they will encounter. How long before we have what is effectively a half cyborg rugby team literally crushing a 'natural' team, or tearing them limb from limb when some synaptic controller malfunctions or gets the latest blaster worm? Disturbing? maybe.. funny? definately.. In all honesty tho, athletes are getting faster, fitter, stronger and as such, are hurting each other more.. its not that modern rugby players are 'soft' so much as, the fact that the hits are harder, the opponents stronger, and the impact that much more damaging. That said, Robinson should harden the fuck up, because without him, who in the all blacks is gunna start the 'biffo' that I so love to see in a match? Gah. I'm gutted. Wuss! *shakes fist* Tail end of being sick and I'm eating like a motherfucker, I wouldnt be at all suprised if this weekend costs me 5kg of progress.. but hey.. I know I can do it now, and I start the gym on monday, we'll have a lean mean fighting machine in no time at all. Maybe you should all start fearing the speedo pr0n already :) Peace out, nig-GAZ!

      I'm sure some of you will disagree, but I spend a lot of my time doing things for other people, because I like making other people happy - to me if I can make someone smile, then I'm having a good day - if I can make them laugh, I'm having a great day. I never do these things, expecting anything in return.. I mean if I did then I'd be doing them for the wrong reasons, but i cant help feeling like I'm being taken for granted if I'm doing as many nice little things as I can think of, to make someone elses life a little more filled with smiles, a little brighter.. a little... better in some way, and the most I get back in return is a thankyou. I guess what I'm saying is, that even tho I dont expect it, it would be nice, and make me feel a whole lot better about doing nice things for people, if occassionally some of them, would reciprocate, and do something really thoughtful and nice for me. This is the sort of thing, that when it builds up and you dont talk about it can end, or at least put a lot of stress on a relationship, and I'm not about to lay the blame fully on the other person here.. but rather, I do accept that a large part of this feeling stems from what we all do, which is expect other people , on some level, to respond, react, and interact with us, in the same way and on the same level as we do, to them. This is unreasonable, as we're all different people, but at the same time it's human nature. Hmm. Conundrum. Any thoughts? am I a selfish prick? I had someone, a dear friend, complain about feeling the same way, to me, and I did what I could to try and cheer this friend up, and ironically, it wasnt appreciated :D I guess maybe it's harder to see what others do for us, all the time, if we become complacent, or used to them being there, doing it.. I'm saying we take people for granted. On a lighter note... I headed off to buy a motherboard for the next computer trickle-down effect, the one I really wanted was an 18g pro version 2 (ooOOoer fancy sounding huh?) but budget didnt quite stretch that far, and I decided the 18g version 1 would have to do, so off I went to friendly computer store, where I attempted to haggle the price of $204 down to something a little less 'in a town with only one computer store'ish.. a bit closer to the online/auckland pricing. Mumbling under my breath about ripoff artists, I begrudgingly left with motherboard box under my arm, having talked her down a whopping $4 :/ I guess I'm not quite the charming negotiator that I thought I was - ahh well. Mike and I stopped briefly a little way down the road, to realise the dizzy bitch had bagged an 18GProII instead of the version 1 I'd paid for! bwahaha! Now this, is quite cool, I get what I ideally wanted, other than world peace, and got it for exactly the price I could afford.. saving something close to a hundred bucks. Brilliant. Also bought some trackpants for the gym.. I'm used to shopping in Farmers, where one department goes from xxl -> 6xl, but today I grabbed a pair of xl trackpants, and headed off. They fit. They fit possibly a smidgen closer than I'm used to, but they're comfortable, and dont illustrate the curves of my frank'n'beans, so they'll do nicely. $20. Excellent. I didnt cave in and get the token 'rotorua' hoodie this time, but I'm sure it wont be long till I do. I spent what little change I had left on a couple of Pork steaks for dinner, because ol' smokey eyed up the pork at the supermarket the other night, but I think declined due to cost.. he loves pork.. so I thought it might put a smile on his dial. Pork steaks, bacon cabonara, and butterbeans.. he's in quite the jovial mood. Excellent. And on that note, I'm gunna go watch some celebs bash each others brains out, in the name of charity. Neet neet folks!

      I was reminded today that it is a good thing to be rid of any grudges , hatred or spiteful feelings that we may harbour toward another, regardless of the reason we feel justified in doing so. Anger, as they say, is a hot coal, let go, it fades away, held closely - it burns. Someone wronged me a while back, bit the hand that fed, so to speak.. but the person in question , I'm convinced, had no idea that what they were doing was hurtful or decietful.. I believe at the core of every person there is goodness.. and that in there own way, every person does whatever they do because in their mind, there is justification for doing so. If we feel wronged, it may be just that we dont understand them, and their reasoning, rather than that they were intentionally hurtful toward us. I'm a happy person, I have a fortunate, and good life, I dont know of any god, to thank for this.. I think to some degree we're the creators of our own destiny.. but I do believe in fate, and that things happen for a reason. Every day the people around me, remind me, just how lucky I am. Those people make me smile when I'm sick, angry, upset and tired. Those people are why I am here, that I might spend my life, trying to return the favour. Gracias. ttfn.

      Sleep.. well, I started into the davinci thing and had to bail, then last night at the extremely early time of ..well, pre midnight, I went to bed and slept till nearly 1pm today.. I've certainly flipped the sleep ratio around - but with the hope of it stopping this chesty cough shizzle. Being sick, sucks,&nbsp; but I'm still smiling from ear to ear. So many special people in my life. Hopefully some friends from auckland might pop in this afternoon, that'll be cool.. havent seen either of them for probably over a year. I'll give them the low-down on the tourist activities :D Grocery Shopping tonight, all out of healthy foods... either grocery shopping or pizza ordering. hmm.. pizza :D nah, I'm kidding, I wanna hit my targets. Short entry for now, as not much has happened in my awake hours today yet. Omelette on for lunch, yo. Peace.

      Well, after braving a hideous sore throat and on the advice of a dear friend I decided I'd put off the davinci sleeping patterns untill I'm over whatever it is flu-wise that has me right now. So at 4am I went to sleep, solidly, blissfully till midday. Excellent :D I've discovered my phone can take about 35 photos, before it is 'full', horrible rainy poo day anyway.. and needless to say I wasnt about to aggrivate my throat and chest with a brisk morning 2 degree rainy run. Not a lot else has really happened today :) omelette for lunch..  Sausages for dinner.. not sure what I'll do with them, casserole? maybe. Anyway, peace out :D

      Absolutely -no- adverse affects to my days activities bar a small blister on my little toe.. to be expected with new shoes. I had a brilliant day, I felt like I was wired on caffiene or something stronger the whole day.. bursting with energy, people even commented.. I was acting like a nut. I think maybe I was high on life. I decided to stop waiting for my friend Jon to start doing the davinci sleep patterns, and to just do it.. hell I'd started jogging today, why not do the sleep pattern thing too.. and I've picked my 4hrly schedule to be 8am midday 4pm 8pm midnight&nbsp; , picked because it most closely fits in with what a normal work day would be, and seems logical to me at least. By 8am I'd alread accomplised all the computer work I had to do today, so I climbed into bed for my first 20 minute nap, fully expecting as per the experiences of others, to be unable to sleep.. apparently it takes a couple of weeks before your body adjusts. Within minutes I was out like a light, only to wake up not at all groggy, 20 minutes later. Brilliant, beginners luck! I talked briefly to Jon online about my experiences , and we reasoned I'm probably not getting the quality REM sleep that I later will get... seems logical, although I havent ruled out my body being particularly tuned to this sort of sleep behaviour yet.. I can sleep at the stock cars, and in the weirdest places. Anyway, between 8:20 and midday, I find several funny movies on the net including a star wars rap, and george bush and kerry singing 'this land is our land' before heading off to the Gym 4-5 km down the road, on foot, to inquire about prices. I return by 11pm having already signed up membership starts next week. Bugger. Now I need trackpants and other fitness accessories. Ahh well. What price is too much for my own wellbeing? Anyway. Sorted. Davinici sleep patterns, saving 6hrs a day, over the average life span of 100 odd years, will add up to 25years of 'bonus' time, that I wouldnt have otherwise had... that's a lot of time... hard to look at those figures and go 'meh, not worth it' Gradually over the last few weeks a hint of a cough/cold/sore throat has sneaked in.. tonight its noticeably hard to swallow, maybe its off to the Doc for mr Chris. Anyway.. 8pm nap coming up. TTFN

      At 5am in rotorua, it was approximately 1 degree celcius this morning, so I of course went outside without a jacket on, and did something seemingly inane, something that I've mocked other people for doing countless times - because it just makes very little sense. Jog to servo up the road: 13 odd minutes. Jog back from the servo: 13 odd minutes. Distance.. I guess about 800metres? round trip might be 1.5k? certainly not -more- Result: coughing and wheezing like a 90 yr old asthmatic biznatch. when I got -to- the servo, my hands were totally frozen, my face red and chillblaney, so I bought two cans of sugar-free redbull, and holding one in each hand, straight out of the freezer, jogged back, but by the time I got close to home, I was warm, hands were warm, and now I feel fine.  I do however still maintain that running only ever was, and only ever should be considered a -survival- technique. It is ok to run away from something bigger/faster/hungrier than you, it is not ok to jog for 'fun'. I'm jogging to get away from something bigger , fatter, and hungrier than me&nbsp; - the old me. A couple months of jogging, and he'll be long gone. Fucker.  Reminds me of a story, about these two guys who are going for a jog through a forrest, somewhere in africa, they're walking into the forrest to the track they normally run on, carrying their running gear with them. They were just about to the track they normally run, when a terrible crash causes them to spin around to see something right behind them, big, noisy and ferocious, land right on the track. A tiger. A hungry looking tiger at that, with a distinctly viscious look in his eyes. There's a moment of silence as the two friends look at one another in disbelief, then they look at the tiger again. One runner, crouches down and takes off his walking shoes and starts to put on his running shoes, an action that puzzles his friend, who comments "what are you doing? there's -no- way you're gunna outrun a tiger!?!" the guy continues putting on his running shoes before standing up and replying "I dont have to outrun the -tiger-, I only have to outrun -you- "  Something to think about.

      I was given cause tonight to look back at where I've come from, and reminded once again of just how greatful I am for my life, and all the things that have happened in it. Prompted by a friend saying 'you have been quite the unlucky one, havent you :/ ' When I tend to think of myself has having been extremely lucky, at least with my life, so far. I'm certain too, that the future will give me more reasons to be greatful - hopefully many more. On the surface, having had two open heart surgeries, one planned at age 3 and one spontaneously after my aorta exploded, and cancer probably does seem 'unlucky' to most. The heart surgery in 1999 was by far the single most physically taxxing thing I have ever and probably will ever undergo, it's a weird sensation to labour on every breath - it really makes you confront head on, your reasons for being -here- , your reasons for being alive... because right there, you could just as easily give up. I nearly did, but while I too and fro'd the deciscion&nbsp;people turned up to visit me.. friends.. a couple at first, then in groups.. I was too weak to really even acknowledge their presence.. but come they did, more and more, dozens.. to give up would be selfish.. easy on me, hard on all them. My friends, my family. Within my power, to not bring them that hurt. And so I found the strength to fight. I'm glad that it was me, that was in that position, and not someone younger, weaker, more vulnerable, and not someone older, weaker, and less surrounded by good people.. surrounded by love. I love my life, and it loves me back. The cancer thing, in 2001.. well that was a whole heap different, and much more emotionally taxxing.. for a start I was in Rotorua, a whole new ballgame when all my friends were in auckland, and merely visiting would've been a mission and a half. My mother, recently in Australia, made the judgement call to not return to give me support while I was in hospital.. my&nbsp;dad - visibly pained by being there, I sent home at least a dozen times. My elderly deaf grandmother, would sit and smile, sympathetically. And visitors the few that came, I&nbsp;didnt have the heart to tell them, at the time, just how much I felt&nbsp;like dying. This time from somewhere deep inside I found my own strength, my own reasons to live, and chose to be here. I'm a better person for it. I'm a greatful person for it. I'm a strong person for it. And yeah, I know pain now, I know&nbsp;depression now, and I know loneliness now, but I feel like I've beaten them all. I'm in the process of beating weight loss now, I've been rediscovering myself.. I got scared for a while, as my last relationship broke up, that I'd defined myself and my life -by- my relationship, it had come to be who I was, I'd lost the definition of who I was.. I've rediscovered that now, and I'm not in a relationship, and I'm happy.. truely happy.. and life rocks. Every day is good, the air is fresh, and I smile at stupid things .. and stupid people ;) You need to, in life, I think be able to look deep inside yourself, and look at who you are, and what you do, and how you act.. your strengths, your weaknesses... you need to look at it all, and you need to be able to smile, and say to yourself, that you are a good person, that you like yourself, and I can do that. I'm a lucky person, -you- are part of why I'm lucky, as a friend, and I thank you, now, because I probably dont do it enough in person. Whoah.. this is getting long :> Thoughts before I go to bed.. ima haffta up the 'anti' or put in more effort, to maintain a 5kg a week weightloss.. so my new cheapy warehouse shoesies will be helping me walk walk walk my way to a higher calorie consumption. Sorted. Thanks, for listening. TTFN&nbsp;

      When you're at the top of your game you've really got nowhere else to go but down. Allblacks - you didnt play hard enough. merts' should've been in from the begining and byron, but hey - what would I know. And where's my mate that starts the fights? robinson is it? bah. Nevermind :D I rediscovered soft jubes today, yummo. My mate mike seems to be missing.. his tauranga mates are asking me if I know where he is - little disturbing, but I'm sure he'll turn up. I got a parcel from mum, across the ditch, which was nice, took over a month to get here air mail tho.. thats a bit ..odd. I've lost my scrabble buddie, she's lost her internet connection, gay as, beating yourself at scrabble just aint the same. Set my webcam up again but no one wants to see my ugly mug anyway, so meebles bleh! *pout* Great new series I'm downloading, a reality tv show I actually approve of, they've taken 6 amish people and 8 normal people, and popped them together. It's quite cool, and the amish chicks are quite hot ;) I wonder if I can pass for an Izekial? prolly not huh. Ahh well. Nite nite

      So I'm on the bus, coming back from town, listening to 80's music and realising I'm probably the only person on the bus that knows the words.. all the words.. I'm a child of the 80's.. I dont see this as being a bad thing, but it gives a bit of insight into a few things. When I grew up, the friday night activity was rollerskating, not roller blading, I used to watch MacGyver,  Knight Rider, Automan, and HappyDays was on at dinner time. I think the 80s were the mature 70's.. like maybe the 70s were societies teenage years , carefree happy-go-lucky, the 80s had everyone realising that family is important, but so is individuality.. I'm thinking the 80's are kinda like being 21, time to start owning up to stuff, and now? beyond 2000? old age.. everything is doom and gloom :) Doom.. doom 3 is out, a run around and shoot everyone computer game, and a damned nice one, at that, unbelievably atmospheric, something a lot of dime a dozen fps'rs lack. Cool. The original doom I guess is something many of you dont remember.. I remember trying to get doom to connect modem to modem, directly, which was largely not done, way back then. So ph33r, and ph33r me lots. I'm more g33k than you ;) A stunning blonde tourist looked me straight in the eye, smiled and said hi today, I tripped on my words, then on my feet muttered something resembling 'hi' and blushed off into the distance.. Nice one don juan. Great. The chick on the seat infront of me kept preening her hair in an indicitive way, and kept sneaking looks at me, I dont know, and probably never will, if it was because I had a booger hanging out of my nose, of if she thought I was hot. Hah! hot, I got called hot the other day, I expressed my disbelief to a trusted friend, who reiterated, instead of sharing my dumbfoundedness. Gutted. The last thing mr ego needs, is to think he's hot. Ahh well, must be the MacGyver hair ;) go the 80's. These days are ours, all summer long. xoxo

      Theres a tasty fruityness to the candyfloss clouds, that you get on a brillig day such as hence. Wherein, despire thwartings from all sides, and betwixt the middle bit, one manages to find a ray of sunshine, or.. moonshine, to afix thine hopes to. And despite these adversities (not to be confuzzled with universities) one continufies the smileage, because .. ahh and this is the key.. BECAUSE they haft inspiration with meer mmmmm. Like mercona for life, yeah baby. yeah. I'm launch0ring into a line from 'dancing in the moonlight' now, in my mind, theres an odd rastarustyfoofarfeefifarian in there, saying 'yeh mon' after every line the lil 'thinks hes gangstah' south auckland boy says, about having no money and wanting to spraypaint his name on the wall. It's all a quiescent cacaphony of illustrious rapture, inspired by.. the moonlight. Why dancing in the moonlight? because dancing in the sunlight, would be, well, washing up liquid, and that aint no fun, son. A'aight? There's a deeper reasoning a meaning, some symbolism behind the moon, and my recent admiration henceforth of this worldly glowing orb.. and probably a kazillion layers of hidden meaning about reflecting ones happiness back to thine self, and so on and so forth.. but we wont get into that. INstead focus on the nubility. It is the moon. She's my moon, and while all is inspired by her, all seems accomplishable, and therefore, a muse, motivation, and purpose.. not really sure, being the moon, that she understands that. She should tho. She glows. it makes me glow, back and forth, like a double mirror.. not one of those bendy ones what makes you look fat or skinny or like a muppet. I'm Idaho. But she's the moon.

      So I set off bright and early for my 7am gym appointment, weigh in on the gym scales at 119.3kg - with a resounding DOUBLE YOU TEE EFF MATE?!?! and feel like I've been solidly kicked in the guts.. to add insult to injury the nancy pants guy at the gym reckons my blood pressure is too high to excercise, so sends me packing. Fuck that Nancy with a cherry on top. Of course this means I'm too early to catch Super Cheap Autos, so I trudge home and wait till 8:30 so I can book an appointment with the doctor to get the A-OK for excercising. Cunts. Anyway the doctor can only see me if I can make it there in about 20 minutes, so I scrape the bottom of the barrel and taxi in with nothing bigger than a 50c piece, see the doctor, weigh in at exactly what the home scales say -phew- and blood pressure checks out fine, she signs the form, and off I go.. oh wait I've got 70c .. bugger.. its about 5km home, Arse. Or about an hour if you want to put it in them there terms :D So I get home at about 12:30 wanting to grab some change for the bus, and get back into town for my business meeting at 1pm.. hmm.. nope, that aint gunna happen, so I ring and bail, and commiserate with some hot chips. Nearly stand in dog poop getting the laundry in, cant get Doom3 to write to cd's because I've never come across .cue files before, and sometime during dinner prep I get another, stonking migraine. Thanks :D That said, it was a gorgeous day, and within seconds of starting to talk to ol' shorty I'm a bag of smiles, o/~ I get by with a little help from my friends o/~ Adios :D

       urlLink http://the-g33k.com/phpgallery/jakeheke   No, it's not a freakin' cooking lesson, it's what I'm doing, because people keep asking, what I'm doing to lose weight. It's not rocket science *energy consumed*   After a stunning migraine, and 4 hrs sleep I bailed on the 6:15am gym appointment, rescheduled it for 7am tomorrow, I've also got my business meeting tomorrow at 1pm, so all in all it should be a productive day, I'm also going to look at prepping the body of my car, doing some more laundry, and possibly redesigning a webpage. Then in the afternoon... hahaha.. yeah ok. I'd better keep some level of 'achievability' here. I'm thinking about taking secret 'me nekkid' pix at various stages of my weight loss, and body sculpting, as a gloat tool, later, when I hit my goals. Ahh yes but the downside is leaked flabby-sock pix.. hmm. Would I actually care? rah. I'll ask the moon, the moon knows all. What do I mean? well, I just went for a walk, and its a brilliantly clear night, I often look at the moon and ponder things. It usually helps me sort them out. It's great like that, our moon. I was debating the pro's and cons of caring about people, and things, and peoples things. Conclusion? I think it's more of an advantage than a hinderance to care more, rather than less. Anyway, time to sleep, prepare for morning. Wish me luck. Ka Kite

      I'm wondering why I have a 6:15 appointment tomorrow morning at the gym, if its raining there is no bus at that time, to get me there. Gutted. What sort of an idiot am I? ahahah I guess I was caught up in the whole 'commitment and dedication' thing. Gah. Beat me with something solid, so I make these errors less frequently.  *bangs head on desk* Nevermind. It will be fine, I will be fine, -thinks postively- Business meeting on Tuesday, that I'm ill-prepared for, somehow Tuesday seemed further away on Thursday.. yeah, I'm sure that makes sense to someone other than me. Dad hoisted the tipper deck of the truck into the spouting on the house today, made me chuckle, but in his defence, it was close to not hitting. The Rotorua style fence that runs down the side of the driveway is getting steadily more toward the otara-side of its contruction attributes..  theres a very nice 4-5 metres, of dressed treated timber, then just the supports for that timber, then the last section is corrugated iron, the kiwi staple of construction, in various states of rusting/falling down... Saw a guy in town putting up some rustic sorta 'olde wooden' gates for the entrance to this Maoritanga gallery, and I had to chuckle to myself, he'd hinged the wrong side for the gates to open toward the street, leaving only the option of them opening inwards, which in itself isnt a problem, but the length of the gates was greater than the distance between the gates and the doors to the shop, so even opening them inwards wouldnt work terribly well, and as the construction of them, leaves them to be about 20cm thick, it will at best, make a very narrow entrance, ridiculously narrow.. especially considering the width of your average rotoruaian. Classic. Rotorua is a bit like that, lots of people with big-town ideas and small town follow-through... I remember after a year in auckland, coming back to have breads and dips at a rotorua cafe, now the people running the cafe had obviously -read- about or been told about breads and dips.. but hadnt grasped the concept, what we got was some white sliced normal kinda toast bread, and the same, in brown, and a few spoons of your chips and dip kinda dip. Fantastic. Nice one rotorua. hmm.. migrain.. I best be off. TTFN

      Imagine if you will, a datsun stationwagon, baby blue. Prestinely restored, with meticulous black flames painted on the bonnet and down the sides... now imagine these flames edged with gold paint... now imagine the whole car bobbing in the water, at the end of a jetty,  20m from shore, in a rotorua lake. Brilliant. Rotorua homies score again.    Current music playing:  Rhombus - Bass Player Album  Currently drinking:  Bundaberg Diet Ginger Beer  Dinner:  Ham & Egg Toasted Sammy, and a hotdog.  I've just finished baking a cake. Yeah, I know, but everyone kinda didnt make a big fuss about a friend of mines birthday, and she's coming to visit tomorrow, so I thought I'd bake a cake, put childish little candles in it, and make a big fuss.    I think it'll be fun, and hey - if it gets a smile, then its all good. Today I got told, that I was amazing, by text, that I'd made someones day.. that their huge smile was because of me.. I'll tell ya, there's no better feeling than that. It really makes me warm from the inside out.  Have a great night, even if you're getting shitfaced on Jaggermeister and RedBull. Ka Kite Ano folks.

      Today I'm reminded how annoying it is, for me, to deal with people who -dont- plan in advance, it really throws me off.. I like to know rough times people plan on arriving, so I can leave things to the last minute, even a commitment like 'before lunch' is great compared to 'maybe friday night, possibly saturday morning, real early' Who knows what 'real early' really means? I sure as hell done. Nevermind. I'll stick by planning, it saves me much stress, and makes my life simple. Y'all like flying by the seat of your pants, fine.. just keep it to yourselves :D

      Expectactions are a lot like junk food really.. a lot of things, yet to pass, have a habbit of seeming flawless or a lot better than they will probably turn out to be.. just like junkfood. I dont know about the rest of you, but for me the smell of KFC is particularly alluring, the kfc however, hasn't for a long time, lived up to the hype. I usually end up feeling bloated and let down , by the greasy after-taste, of not just kfc, but by most of the major 'junk food' brands. It's weird. Did KFC ever taste how I remember it? or am I remembering the 'ideal' of what kfc should be? Who knows. But the junkfood least likely to dissappoint is pizza... unless you live in rotorua and order pizza hutt pizza.. then if it actually arrives, it'll be stone cold, and dissappoint - not that cold pizza is by any means bad, but cold garlic bread, cold chips, and luke warm beverage -are-. I think expectations are a lot like this. Birthdays are one thing a lot of people seem to get anxious about, myself excluded - I've never seen the point, but recently one friend has lamented the passing of a perfectly good opportunity to party hard, and another is dreading -missing- the opportunity but assures me that while planning meticulously, that she's not getting her hopes up, yeah right. Planning is something I love, and I think by and large things I plan go well... I've had plethora of feedback from various parties and 'do's that I've put on, commending the effort. I offered to plan the party of the lamenting friend, but she had something to prove to me, by doing it herself.. I guess she did prove something :D Just not what she wanted to. Another thing that fails to live up to expectations, generally speaking, geek upgrades. I recently trudged into town to confront in person, the store that should've already rung me to let me know the cpu I wanted was in, but they hadnt rung, surely an oversight. Alas, they tell me that it had come in, but that they used it for something else. That'll serve me right for giving my business to locals, I could've ordered it from auckland for less, and had it quicker. I told the manager in no uncertain terms, that it simply wasnt good enough. He promised to have me one by Thursday morning. Again, not good enough. Poor effort guys. Ahh well, I was not as disheartened as I could've been - because Cpu or not, the ram hadnt arrived yet, so I wasnt going to be doing anything with it -anyway-, reluctantly I trudge away from the store. I check my bank balance to find out that not only had the cancelled gym subs -still- come out, but that they'd bounced, and the admin fee also bounced, not a big deal for the actual subs and admin fee, only $15 a piece, but the bouncing fees were $25 each.. $50. Bugger. Because of that, no spare cash. Gutted. So I walk off to where I think my meeting with my business advisor is, only to realise I have to walk a km and a half, to the -actual- location.. ahh well. At least it wasnt...and then it did.. yep.. it rained on me. All dressed up, smart gears, walking for 1.5k, in the rain, with paper work. I arrive, cant find the office in the building, finally do, and have a laugh with the business advisor lady, about how much days can suck.. she repeatedly tries to coerce me into having a coffee - even after I pointed out that I'm trying to cut down. The meeting goes well, and as I leave, it starts to rain again. ahh well, at least when I get to town, I've got $1.50 for the bus. Score. Everything was finally coming up millhouse! just as the bus arrived at my stop, my cellphone rang, it was the lady from the computer store that I just used my last $1.50 to be away from, telling me the chip had arrived. RAAAH!!! ahh well, calm down Christopher, your ram isnt here, so as I start down the driveway of my house, I notice a courier packet, in the letterbox. The ram. Gutted. So I get home, peel off my wet clothes, make a coffee that I'd been turning down all afternoon, and started playing sad music, when mike and his gf turn up and offer to take me into town after hearing my plight, I agree, we head off, and return triumphant, 3000mhz faster :D so I fix the ladies computer I was working on, she turns up to claim it, gives me $10 cash, after hearing the story of my day, the rest to be deposited on pay day, into my now overdrawn account. Hurrah! the roast I put on, topside, slow cooked in red wine, smells gorgeous, mike stays for dinner, the new computer re-install goes almost flawlessly, and I roll, once more, smiling, into bed. I should've had a shit day.. but fuck that =D what a waste.

      There seems to be an air of change to a lot of the lives of people around me.. a reasonable need for support, companionship and reassuring support. It's nice to be able to be there for you guys, whichever of you need help, because you're all there for me. I'd gotten used to having something in my days, which is no longer there, and for a moment or two today, I was at a bit of a loss, for what to do with the time, but I'm stumbling through. A good friend of mine has come to the party and I'm told a stick of ram is en route , and its arrival should coincide with the arrival of my new cpu.. and the arrival of my new gfx card.. all up, pretty much a whole new computer. Fantastic. Which coincides with Doom3, but is completely unrelated, its just an interesting coincidence. Nothing much interesting to say today, but I've gotten shit before for not updating, so far be it from me to do -that- again. I've been forced to add to foreigners to 'block' on msn, I'm not sure what it is about not being from nz that seems to make people annoying,  but strangely, it seems more often the case than not. ahh well. That'll do, time for toast and milo and open fires. More tomorrow, I promise?

      I'll be the firs to admit it, I'm the worst hypocrit when it comes to driving. I'm so very critical of other peoples driving/parking/backing abilities, and I'm not legally entitled to drive myself. I admit that, but it doesnt mean that Im wrong, just that I'm a cheeky monkey. So deal with it.  Rotorua driving is so totally different to auckland driving... and this goes for parking, backing and well..cars in general if you read my other entries about pimped out rides. I live across from a nice wee set of shops, on a short road, between two larger roads, one side of the road is shopping, the other side is houses, choice. There is ample parking within the parking area of the shops, but apparently for HUGELY OBESE or HUGELY FUCKEN LAZY natives, it's far easier or more convenient, to park on the road, and waddle over to have a korero with aunty hemi and roll a smoke, leaving their big-ass piece of shit car parked badly, in a bad place. Fuck I wish I had a bulldozer, or a hummer with a snow plow, or something. Grr. Right, you come around a 90' corner from a straight road into our wee street, before your car has finished the turn , the nose of it will come to meet an idiot, parked a car length at most, from the corner. So you swerve, to avoid it, realising that the other car, parked opposite, means that if someone was coming the other way, you would've just died. Brilliant. The store keeper Jai - my indian nigga, has had painted, some yellow diagonals, immediately out front of his shop, to stop the 'oh I just gotta get smokes for rangi' kinda stops, that end up in a half our shop, or visit to the fish and chip shop/pokie machines or hairdresser - fuck knows... but needless to say it doesnt work, if anything its like flypaper. Piece of shit over-engined holdens and fords, stuck to it, 24/7. The town planners in rotorua did a bad job. A pretty job, but a bad job. The city street angle parking is such that if you get two 4x4's opposite one another, you wont get a third through the middle.. hell, the mini barely fits... er not that I'm driving it, that'd be illegal - even if you'd never get caught much less pulled over in rotorua, hey look over there its something distracting! *phew* People in their piece of shit pimped out rides will either boost in every 100m gap they find/make or forecourt they come across, OR they'll drive at 15km/hr, while their Lightning Audio subs shake all the remaining original body paint off their car. Asians. Rotorua has a lot of asian drivers.. that always seem to be the size of a small monkey and about as 'awake' to the world.. they look straight ahead, chuck it in reverse (eventually - it seems to take longer if you're waiting for their park) then slowly back out, regardless of what is coming.. ok a late model SLK cant have the best rear view.. but I'm damned sure if it has a problem, it has backing cameras or something to compensate? but hell, they dont evne use their mirrors, its the same as when they're walking.. this is where I'm going, and what I'm doing, to hell with you if you get in my way, if I dont own your country now, I will by the time it gets to court YO STOOPPPEH ROUN' EYE MUDDA FUH' ER! *breathes* Tourists. Bless their wee hearts, or sweet sweet asses.. mm swedish hiking babes..reow.. sorry.. off on a tangent there.. tourists driving.. thankfully you can spot the huge white camper vans a mile off.. but its still frightening to see them drive down the wrong side of the road. And if I see the universal symbol for 'Im sorry' one more time, I think I'm going to start hitchhiker killing sprees. DIE DIE DIE. Couple more peeves' and I'm off to bed.. hang in there! Distracted drivers... this covers mothers with unrestrained children, people with pets running free in the car, driving texters, driving eating a whole big mac combo with supersized drink people, and the 'I'll look at you while I'm talking and look everywhere but where we're going' people. YOU ALL SUCK. In my short time on this earth, I've been in two vehicles as they've been written off, driving neither of them, and in many more that nearly got written off, everything from late model Aristos' to 1967 minis.. vans, utes and trucks. My knees have gone through dashboards, and I have spat out windscreen glass. I've had stressed drivers take me through down town auckland red lights without stopping, I've had people drive into rocks, plainly obvious, that were bigger than the vehicle. I've learnt, even tho it'll piss people off, that I cant live with myself if I assume someone has seen something, and they havent. I'm paranoid. It's a rational fear. I dont trust other peoples driving. Me? I'm perfect. Shut up. I am too. Ask... him, or her, or them.. they know ;) Ka kite ano folks :D  Quote for the day: "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"

       This is cool, I love having dreams,Last night, my oldest mate, Scott and I were running through a shopping centre trying to get to a carpark, where Charlotte in her mini picked us up.That was it. Loved it tho. Weird.Had a migrain that I should've gotten yesterday because of the nuts amount of coffee's I had.. I guess it was lag or something - ahh well, mondays traditionally suck for most people anyway - right? So nothing wasted.Sadly a mate of mine has written off his car, his work car at that, but there is a slight irony that I feel obliged to point out. His personalised plate reads 'WARDRV' - meaning 'war drive'...Makes you wonder if the insurance company will be lenient with him. Fingers crossed dude.I overclocked my computer today, with standard cooling, and non-exceptional results, but oh well, at least I didnt melt anything including my self esteem.Then I had to talk to Scabaret, who informs me his substantially cheaper CPU is overclocked further.. which irks me. On the upside, his new haircut sucks. BAHAHAHARight, that's all folks.

       Listening to:  Moby - South Side Remix  Dinner:  Butter Chicken on Rice, Hokey Pokey Icecream for desert.  Drinking:  Coffee, lots of it.  I had a dream last night, and like most dreams that we remember (which are only the ones we wake up, or stir from our sleep during) it didn't make a fuckload of sense.  It started with me and some (presumably) friends, sitting on some grass with back packs.. maybe school-esque, having lunch or morning break, but it turns out where on someones verge / front lawn.. but the section we're on is one of those ones you can only get to the back yard of, if you go through the house, now me and the people I'm with, sneak through this old ladies house, to get to her back yard, where the two kids boy twins from 'everybody loves raymond' are playing in a cubby house, and I'm all of a sudden walking on top of the fences that separate all the properties in the vacinity.. much to the dismay of the people around me. Weird. About then, my friend charlotte wakes me up with a coffee. I love dreams, they intrigue me. I think the random items in any given dream, can be sorted out.. but I think the dream is the association and cross-linking between seemingly random items in our mind.. I think when we dream, our mind is building this 'database' if you will, of what we remember, and how it relates to other things we remember. That's my theory. Choice.  What a cool weekend, it's always nice to have someone visit, and after being so rudely let down on the thursday night, by one person, it was nice to have someone come through with what they said they'd do. Charlotte loved her birthday cake, which ended up a 3 layer chocolate cake with blackberry jam and cream between each layer, frosted with chocolate frosting, and a crumpled flake over top, with 21 candles.. her 21st having past a week or two ago. Spent the weekend doing some of the 'us' things in rotorua, like indulging in our favourite onion rings (yes they're good enough to talk about) and making videos of racing around the city in the minis. Charlotte didnt expect the cake, at all, which was nice, nor did she expect the presents, which was also cool - suprises are great, especially when you get to see a persons face light up. What I didnt expect, was how much I enjoyed the visit.  Need For Speed Underground has pointed out to me just why some people buy steering-wheel setups for their pc's. It's very very sexy.. and plays so nicely. Makes the X-Box version look like a crudely carved piece of bison-board. I should get paid tomorrow, for the computer I fixed 3-4 days ago, this is a good thing, as I'm stoney broke. Ahh well... the cupboards are full, and I'm content :D  I must restart my strict eating plan, the sock-knows-best diet, and the jogging/walking.. Plus, now I've got a business plan to put together. Kia Kaha, e noho ra.
