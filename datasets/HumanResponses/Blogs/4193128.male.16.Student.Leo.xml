      The rest of my vacation was not that exciting we went to places like the aquarium and shopping places in Charleston one time though that was pretty funny was when this one restaurant that we were looking for was on this one street and we must have went on this street going all the way to the other side of town turning around going the other side of town like five times you have to remember that Charleston is like one 15th of Chicago so it only took like 15 minutes to go across town but we must have went 3 times passing this place it was so funny after thinking about it my parents were not very happy about it though. We also went to some really boring museums and fort sumptner where the most hilarious thing happened on this vacation there was this tuor guy of this confederate army official he was one of those guys that took his job way to seriously he was clad all in this army uniform and had that funny cowboy slash army hat and he yelled instead of talked and had that funny mustache and when he was yelling he would actually spit sometimes but the most funny thing was the way he talked he talked in a southern forest Gump voice it was so funny so me being you know the obnoxious guy I am walk up to him and ask him hey can you say for me life is like a box of chocolates I kid you not he goes all red in the face leans forward and goes DO YAH THIN THAT’S FUNNY YAN KEEE with that forest Gump pause in the middle sounding just like forest Gump he like yelled really loud and spit in my face as he talked of course and I was like yep as I like jogged slashed power walked away really fast cracking up

        Today I woke up at 6:15 to finally go on my trip waking up my right check is swollen and I have this horrible taste in my mouth.  I felt like I just got slugged by a hammer or Sean Denz or Mike Ospina somehow landed all of their weight on my cheek and jumped up and down.  I had just got my wisdom teeth taken out and something was wrong.  Finally at 6 in the fin morning I knew   right away this trip was not going to be the pleasant trip I expected finally waking up we reach o hare grab a McDonalds sandwich I got a mcgriddle and sausage with two breakfast burritos mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm its so good but so bad than picking at my right cheek I figured something was so swollen way in the back by my right molar that I started picking at it with my super sharp index middle finger nail the longest one missing my tooth totally hit my swelled up check puncturing it and squishing out the most awful tasting puss I’ve ever tasted but after getting all of the puss out the swelling went down and I finally didn’t feel like Sean denz sat on my face anymore yes this is how my vacation started out I was like oh boy  I cant wait till this     vacation gets even better.  Finally getting out of the mini size airport like 1 to 1000000th the size of O’Hare air port we go and get our rented car on the way over there I noticed a newspaper with hurricane Charlie on hitting Florida and I am like oh that sucks not thinking for a minute that the hurricane would soon be going straight for us finally we get our rental car and we our pinned behind two scvs we wait for like 55 minutes just to get out of the parking lot because the two cars behind us they lost the keys too and now it is absolutely pouring down pour.  And were like great. Finally we get out of there and we get directions to our hotel supposedly on the river front. We of course get lost and have a navigational fight go left no go straight no go right go up errrrrrrrrrrrr finally getting to our hotel we walk past the swimming pool which I’ve seen Jacuzzis bigger than and we go to our room which is on the opposite side of the river facing the most ugly parking lot in the world and were all like grreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaat finally we just passed out after watching the Olympics and went to bed .

      I am so screwed this is my first blog and I don't know if I can remember the password to it lmao thats just lioke me if your a friend of mine you probably are remembering some stupid asinine thing ive done I will never drink grape juice again so this may be my last blog I am such a retard sometimes it was like 15 seconds a go to wtf was it  whateva ill probably have to create another one so anyway i would like to thank two good buddies for getting me started David rief and dylan calewarts who i love dearly as good friends of course. Jennifer might get jealous if i say that i love you guys shes my girlfriend i am so not telling her about this log so i can get all my stress by talkin shit about everything i love so i so do not blow up on them. i so hope they do not find this blog anyway lot of my good friends dont know me that well (my swim team peeps) and the people i do know me way to well (backstabbing best friend) so ill try to fill you in on a big part of my life that is extremely depressing  last year I so met this girl you know this is gonna be depressing when i start like this who i deeply fell in love with at this time i had a good friend for about 8 years we were great buddies and we were like sychic the only problem with this good friend was he has this habit of stealing girls that i liked so you cold say that he really isnt that great of a friend but I have known him for so long and were like brothers so to be cautious i specifically told him to stay away from this girl i said i like this girl about twice a day for like two weeks this was at like the end of the year so i so was sheepishly talkin to her you know the little wave hi and running away fast cuz your so nervous the hey how was your day and than acting like your a retard by tripping and hitting her with the biggest book (bio honars that book was a bitch) and feeling so god damn embaressed  so i finally was getting the nerve up to ask her out when we were talkin one day and says omg anthony i am so hoappy oh and dont be mad at joey he just asked me out as the world crumbles at my feet pigs start to fly jori turns out not to be gay mrs warfield is actually nice to scott chou luaren apologizes to david for beinga bitch mr myren comes out of retirement it seems all these odd things could happen if my best friend could once aain betray me like that I just didnt get how my best friend could do this to me. his response it just kind of happened errr that pissed me off i was like my fist pummeling your face is just gonna happen but he was my best friend and i promised myself that i would never let a girl get in between our good relationship as a friend i just couldnt believe that he could do this to me im over heather now and of course joey and heather are still going out strong it just evertime i c them kiss i remeber all the times i told joey about how much i cared for her and he just ignored it like whateva i say means nothing to him.  I hear so end my first journal and i just just remembered my password so all is good please post on what i should have done tommorow i so will tell you how i handle it and more deprressing notes on my life
