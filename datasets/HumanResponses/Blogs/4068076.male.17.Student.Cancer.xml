       Although I am rarely bothered my individuals in my life constantly telling me to find a job, I am beginning to question myself and ponder the idea of actually giving up my fine streak of unemployment. However, I am reluctant to just surrender to the nine-to-five work force as I am having way too much fun without a job. Let's review the pro's and con's of each concept:     &nbsp;   Employment Pro's/Con's:    1) The most significant aspect of holding a job is being able to earn money and spend it as you wish instead of constantly asking the parents for twenty dollars for whatnot. In addition, I could buy myself some much-desired items and buy the girlfriend some very nice presents on those dreaded Hallmark holidays.    2) During those boring days when my friends are all working or whatnot, it would be a shame to waste it not working as well as there is rarely anything exciting happening around Lake County. Thus, what would normally be a wasted day, could just as well be transformed into a productive day of money-earning.    3) I suppose you could claim that having a certain type of job could equip you for the real world with the much-needed skills and education that is in demand these days.    4)&nbsp;Work can really suck at times, since you most likely have a high-ranked individual&nbsp;controlling your actions. As far as I am concerned, I do not plan on having&nbsp;balding, middle-aged men telling me how to live my life.    5) As desirable as money sounds and smells, wasting my life away at roughly $7.00 an hour is really unacceptable in my book. I would probably be more succesful and delighted asking seven different people for $1.00 every hour rather than asnwering to some power-tripping chump.    6) Waking up at early hours on my summer vacation really sounds great, but I do not think I'm the man for the job.     Unemployment Pro's/Con's  :    1) Being a fine member of the unemployed community, I can easily vouch that it is a very easy lifestyle. It rarely requires doing anything unwanted and I do everything according to my own schedule.    2) I often see my friends either complaining about how early they have to wake up the next morning or worrying about what time they have to show up at work. Well, I like to productively begin my day with a nice, slow awakening at the crack of noon. I then browse the internet, call up my other unemployed partner in crime, and plan out my day according to what needs to get done. Today for example, BD came over to play his guitar while I carefully waxed a car I have not driven in two weeks and probably will not drive until school begins again on the 24th of August. After that, SG came over from work and I washed her car while BD managed to catch up on some hard-earned sleeping. After the necessary washing and drying, the three of us sat in the car listening to some musical tunes. Then, at about 7:00 PM, I finally showered and came outside to find BD, JG, and FR in my driveway. We sat on the North end of my house. While they smoked, I began to attempt handstands. Then, I browsed the internet some more and came across this tool. Neverthless, I considered today a very productive day besides my failure to do a successful handstand.    3) To having money seems to be a good reason not to spend it, thus, worries regarding how much money I have wasted on certain items have been eliminated.    4) I enjoy not having to go to sleep at a certain time so that I may be rested by the next morning. Life should be lived mostly by the moment, but sometimes through planning. Significant aspects of life should be planned out prior, but smaller events should be taken as they arrive.     &nbsp;   Therefore, I am debating the two topics at hand. I apologize for the jumble between positive and negatives aspects of both ideas but I hate separating things at 1:44 AM. The biggest positive trait of employment is obviously money, which happens to be the biggest negative characteristic of not having a job; not having money.

       I recently read an article regarding a friend's perspective towards the world of smoking and the outsiders reactions towards those individuals. Instead of creating an anonymous comment, I decided to create a new account to counter his  radical  opinions and flash my ego at the same time. Nevertheless, with this, hopefully I'll burn two down...    &nbsp;  As much as I agree with his points regarding one's personal choices throughout life, I have some comments to make about his literary creation. Primarily, I believe that the reason someone bothers another about their smoking habit depicts that the non-smoker cares about the smoker's newly-acquired tobacco tastes. I do not believe that individual's  bothersome  suggestions should be outright ignored. Thinking about it from the oppostive point of view, do you honestly believe that someone wants to nag about a smoker stopping day in, day out? Clearly, there is some reason they are so bothersome. However, I have rethought my approach to others and will not fiddle with their strings any longer. My new  foreign  policy plays out as follows:    &nbsp;  I am going to go about my non-smoking ways as I have always gone about them, simply to not smoke. My new, fresh hobby will clearly make me stronger, faster, and more tolerant to much more than smoke. Therefore, smoke away with happiness tobacco consumers. I more so enjoy the smell of money than  filtered  smoke. My smoke-free life is just as relaxing, just as happy, just as enjoyable.    &nbsp;  However, I'll post some positive feedback to his poesy. I respect his ability to make mends to non-smokers by offering his suggestions.    &nbsp;  "If&nbsp;a does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he has arrived at an obstacle."
