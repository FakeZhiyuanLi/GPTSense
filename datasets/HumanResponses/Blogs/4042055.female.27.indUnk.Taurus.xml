       I try to be close to you, but just far enough out of range.&nbsp; I find myself missing every move you make but I can't have you and&nbsp;communicate with any others.&nbsp; It's either you and no one else or anybody else but you.&nbsp; You set these standards for me but you're free to lie, leave out, avoid the conversations, hide things, manipulate my words, play around with others, etc.&nbsp; Stop already!&nbsp;   I've asked you for nothing in return.&nbsp; My feelings are hurt and it kills me when your rage is directed at me.&nbsp; Going into this 'situation'&nbsp;I knew it was my decision to just be 'happy to hang around'.&nbsp;   It's never been easy to let you go or forget our times together.&nbsp; Nothing about you is easy, that's why all this is so hard.&nbsp; We made the rules up as we went along and now we've come to a dead end.&nbsp;   You tell me you love me but I know in my heart this isn't how you love someone.&nbsp; I've tried to distance myself but your prying eyes allow you to assume too much.&nbsp; You don't know and you never will.&nbsp;   May you find health and happiness with your new adventure.&nbsp;  The sun has set.

       I'm hearing different stories from different men in my life.&nbsp; Some say I hung the moon, others wish I'd never been born.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words they tell me sound so rehearsed it hurts.&nbsp; Doesn't anyone speak from the heart anymore?   I can't remember my mom and dad doing anything endearing with each other (I was too young when they separated).&nbsp; My father has remarried and his wife of 10 years he still brings her coffee in bed,&nbsp;prepares dinner, and (attempts to) paint her toe nails.&nbsp; Those are sweet ways to show you care and he does much more, but that's what stands out most.&nbsp;   I'm not looking for a man anything like my father (we have such a distant relationship).&nbsp; The relationships I've been in all seem to be so bittersweet.&nbsp; I don't like to share.&nbsp; I'm jealous.&nbsp; I hate mean people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me&nbsp;one man that wants me just as much as I want him.&nbsp;   Today I was brought breakfast and coffee, I guess I just need to enjoy the simple things in life and quit focusing on what I don't have.&nbsp; Thanks K!    &nbsp;

       ...the fine print.&nbsp; Make sure you read the label first.&nbsp; Why can't relationships come with some kind of contents label.&nbsp; I guess with all the web&nbsp;dating services and people trying to describe themselves in one paragraph we're getting what we've asked for.&nbsp; I'm not feeling too positive about my future at this&nbsp;point.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  If i took all&nbsp;this pain away right now i'm not sure i'd have anything inside.&nbsp; This is what fills my up right now.&nbsp; I hope this&nbsp;chapter in my life is something i look back on&nbsp;and i'm able to find a smile.    &nbsp;  I've gotten yet another job offer in the Tyler area and that's not where i'd like to&nbsp;start a new chapter.&nbsp; Much more money but the same small town.&nbsp;    &nbsp;

        Friday  night I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2 and The Exorcist. I started the latter around 12 am. NOT A GOOD THING!! I figured since it was Friday the 13th that I should watch something scary and I should have thought that through a bit more.  Sat.  was shopping with Dawn for her wedding. We ventured to Arnes Warehouse for reception junk. While there Lynn (Matron of Honor) and I found some items we plan to use for the bachelorette party coming up too soon. Lynn's husband rented us a limo for that night. Now we can get our drink on and not have to worry. We have it till 11 am the next morning. He's the best man ever!!!    Ventured to The Woodlands that night to watch the Texans kick the Cowboy's ASS with some friends!! They grilled a filet mignon for me and mixed up Mojitos (haven't had one of those since South Beach). The weather has been beautiful the past few day so we spent most of our time outside. Got to see Jeffery's new BMW and new house. I advised him that a coupe would be a pain in the ass placing a car seat in/out of. He remains positive or he'll buy something else (him and Stephanie are still trying to conceive).  Sun.  was scuba with the Public Safety Dive Team. The scenario was to retrieve a baby that the mom had dumped in because she just couldn't take it anymore. Spent 4 hours on that task. Had a great time and met tons of new people.

       $$Got a raise on 8/10/04! This should help me save a bit more. Hoping to buy a house one day!! Tired of renting and tired of growing out of my living space. I hate clutter!    Drove down to Pearland and Bonnie called me in her office.  Handed me a letter and told me 'You deserve this and thank you for the past 3 years'.         ~Loves It~

      7/29/04: Ventured to Galveston around 3 pm. Met up with Merry Jo and had some drinks at Gaido's Seafood Restaurant. Loved the Chi-Chi's!! So pink and so good! Topped with a cherry (of course). 7/30/04: Finished with seminar around 12 and ventured to The Strand. Shopped and looked for a while. Met up with Tracie and Steve around 4 pm to go sailing. They introduced me to a guy named Jeff. He has a house in Clear Lake but currently lives in The Netherlands. He was quiet and seemed very polite. He's PADI certified also!! Met George and his wife Annette that night too. They went out with us too and let me see their boat when we returned. This was my first night sail. With the full moon and the smooth surf, it was amazing. Kema looked beautiful! We got in around 3:30 a.m., showered and went straight to bed. 7/31/04: Got dolled up for the wedding. Brene Charles Addison and Kristy Lynn Choate married at St. Patrick's Church. Father Flajole (Rev. LoveJoy) was super boring so I couldn't wait for the reception. Headed to The Balinese Room for wine/food/fun!! I hung with Beth most of the time. We walked down a long wooden pier with our gifts. Made our way in, to find huge pics of Frank Sanatra and the Mob gambling and drinking. Huge newspaper articles from the Golden Era lined the walls. Articles stated that the Margarita was invented there! The Balinese sits over the water and it's windows showed a beautiful full moon. The bride looked amazing and so happy. Merlot was okay, food wasn't that great, but the view was amazing. Met lots of people and shared numbers. Had a great night. Drove up to downtown Houston to meet Steve, Rob and Tracie for some drinks. They had been to the Angelica watching The Village. We watched some salsa dancing and ventured back to the house. 8/1/04: Woke-up to the smell of coffee. Steve uses a French Press and he's spoiled me every morning (afternoon) with a hot cup. I love the flavor it provides. This is a must have.... Went sailing again...met up with another Kelly, her husband Patrick Devlin is the front man of the Blaggards. Their children Conner and Tara were amazing. Super good children!!  urlLink http://www.blaggards.com/  Patrick is Scottish and I loved the language! He invited me to some gigs so I'll share my opinion then. Headed back to shore and tied the boat down. Pat and family left. Johnny (went on his sailboat before; reminds me of the Gorton's Fisherman) asked us if we'd join him for dinner. We ate at Gilhooney's (famous for oysters) had them and seafood gumbo. Later, we drove back to Pearland and showered. I finally arrived home about 12:30, super tired. Busy weekend but tons of fun!!
