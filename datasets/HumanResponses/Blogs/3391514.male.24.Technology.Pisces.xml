      Didn't sleep well at all last night... could be the heat, could be the fact I was asleep earlier in the night.  I do remember an interesting dream involving a global plague and having to steal a car at gunpoint.  I shan't mention  whose  car I was stealing... thats far too obscure.  I went out and bought  Black Hawk Down  and  Hulk  this afternoon.  I already owned Black Hawk Down on VHS, but its nice to have it on DVD as well.  Hulk is another matter.  As a testament to its reported poorness, the box self-destructed as I removed it from the plastic wrapping, much to my disgust.    Also got  The Forever War  by Joe Haldeman.  I've read that its a story in a similar vein to Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  I hope its even half as good.  I completed Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour today.  The game with the worst taste ever lives up to the C&C name in terms of presentation, but it is utterly without a soul.  You really don't care whether you win or lose.  At least the previous incarnations had one thing going for them - kick-ass FMV.  This new incarnation doesn't even have that... virtually everything is done using the engine.  Pah.  Roleplaying is looking as poor as ever.  As soon as a game comes along that looks half-decent, it is stopped for one reason or another.  I try to start games and finish them, even if I have to rush an ending.

      Friends ended on terretrial TV tonight.  It seems everything decent is ending at the moment... Farscape, Voyager and Buffy.  Angel has been apparently axed, as has Andromeda... and it seems little is taking its place.  I hope I'm wrong!  I did comparitively little today as I've been more than a little tired.  After storming through another five chapters of Transformers: Fusion and going to sleep, I was first awoken by the cat, and then someone wanting a lift.  Obviously the 4am mornings of earlier in the week had caught up with me.  Roleplaying is looking a bit dicey this weekend... one GM is making his usual excuse and the other has alternate arrangements.  Is nothing sacred?!

      So I went on my weekly visit to a nearby city today.  Said city is much the same as my own, only it has more roleplaying opportunity, if you catch my drift.  The only chance encounter was a cheap copy of the second book in the Resident Evil novel series.  Its written by Perry, who has done some good work in the Aliens line, so I have high hopes.    If only I could get through my other books first...  I  almost  bought the Visionaries DVD, but decided against it for now.  I'll get i eventually, get all nostalgic and then wonder why I liked it in the first place.  I'm doing that with re-runs of Ulysses 31, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors and M.A.S.K on Toonami...

      ER is great.  I just thought I'd mention that.  I'm probably behind, 'cause I only have terrestrial TV, but the show brings about true emotions.  However, there is one tiny problem.  As it is about all sorts of medical disasters, and I have an appointment with one, it tends to make one jumpy.  Speaking of which, browser hijack paranoia has me more than a little on edge now.  I don't understand why people write these things.  Someone should write some kind of recursive anti-virus virus, that invades the server of said perpetrator and erases the software.  That'd make net surfing so much easier...  Back to TV - the Andromeda re-run of Season 1 concluded yesterday.  Season 1 was better than Season 2 IMO... I hope Season 3 is better.  What makes things worse is the scourge that is Big Brother is coming back to our screens.  Why is 21st century TV so unbelievably bad?!

      I'm back from a short hiatus of non-Internet usage, thanks to the evils of Spyware.  Thanks to the good graces of a well-known anti-spyware device things are returning to normal, but my usual paranoia has been catapulted through the roof.  In other news, the WoD game ran, from 10pm till 3.30am.  It was amusing and more than a little insane... but really showed holes in my GMing and knowledge of the system while running it.  It seems when I'm a player I can easily remember the rules, but as a GM I don't and thus resort to winging it.  It seems my home game is not going ahead as one of my players is unwell.  A pity, as he makes up 50% of the group.  Finally, my current monetary difficulties may be solved.  With the impending operation I may be able to get some kind of income support.  Which is nice.

       The World of Darkness , not the moronic pop group.  My short campaign set there is going ahead in leaps and bounds, and will be starting on Monday.  Its interesting as the players only have to construct a concept, rather than a fully fledged character.  It should be interesting.  Its my first actual foray into running a game there.

      So, just went to see Van Helsing, after many days of delay.  Combined with the intensified headache I now possess, I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have bothered.  Its not that its a bad film... just very VERY underwhelming.  The action is formulaic, the music is formaulaic (and odd in places... imagine the music from The Mummy interspersed with bizarre guitars) and the acting is typical of the action movie genre.  At least it had Zombie-Dalek-Ewoks.  In other news, there were some results from the opticians... looks like my  visit  is to be going ahead soon... wonderful news.  Sarcasm does not translate well into text.  Remember!  Life is great!

      Inspired by the blog of a friend of mine, I thought I'd write one of my own.  To ensure a certain degree of anonymity, I've used a pseudonym.  Of course, anyone who knows me in real life might guess who I am.  For those people, you are wrong, I'm the  other  one.  To anyone else... I am an unemployed ex-student (with a degree in Computing) living in the frozen north of England.  My exciting hobbies include computer games, films, roleplaying, summoning the effort to look for a job and dreading an eye operation later in the year.  Hopefully my hobbies have now been expanded to include "writing a blog".  Damn, this all sounds depressing.  Enjoy life!  Its great!

      My WoD game came to a conclusion on Monday, with a 10-hour session lasting between 4pm and 2am.  It was amusing, and for a channge, the characters survived.  In a sense.  They died for a cause, but were all brought back to live "happily ever after" as it were... a change from my usual apocalyptic style.  Not much else has happened... I'm now on antibiotics to try and get rid of this damned cough, and my sleeping patterns have been disrupted by the damn pillows and cats.

      So, my cat  is  alright, which is a good thing.  Apparently, most are drowsy following an anesthetic, but mine wanted food, and lots of it.  Good to see him back on his paws so quickly...  I also got some antibiotics to help with this damn cough... don't know what it'll do about next weeks operation.  Today has therefore been spent tired and worried, and lately, utterly paranoid.  Mainly regarding this new virus doing the rounds, but Pc use in general.  I need a better Os, or something.  I got round to watching the rest of the first  Visionaries  DVD.  I have to say I'm impressed.  The series had a reasonable storyline with a tiny bit of continuity, and interesting characters.  Well, the bad guys were interesting, as they possessed personality traits... the good guys are all alike.  I also watched a documentary about bionic limbs.  Freaky, but the science is evolving.  I only hope they can develop it more in my lifetime.  The "bionic eye" was truely freaky... as it necessitated implants in the brain.  Ouch!

       Freespace 2  is the best spaceflight game out there bar none.  Wing Commander, X-Wing et al, Starlancer, Freelancer - none come close.  It is one of my favourite games of all time.  I just completed it again, but this time on Medium.  The game is damn hard.  I've started it again on Insane... and it lives up to its title.   Ballerburg  continues to amuse once you figure on the quick way to win...  (1) Build up economy (2) Disable enemy economy and firepower (3) Bombard  Pretty obvious really.  Got round to watching  Macross - Clash of the Bionoids  this afternoon.  The translation was a little stilted, and the quality was not fantastic.  The story was a little confusing - it seems there was a lot of unexplained backstory.  Also, owing to the content, I'm surprised it made a PG.  Macross II is better by comparison, and Macross Plus trumps them all.  They're all Manga by the way, and are invariably love stories set against a backdrop of war between aliens and humans using giant transforming mechs.  Today's events didn't disappoint... my long suffering GURPS campaign didn't run  again , as the players were no-show  again .  Some days I don't know why I bother.  My cat is off to the vet early tomorrow morning... I pray he makes it through his operation.

      Damn, I'm using up all of my good "nothing" related words.  Recently it seems like I truly have done very little... which is largely true.  Where does the time go?  Today I purchased a game called  Ballerburg  - its kinda like Tanks but with base building as well.  It is amusing, and has good music.  It also cost a mere £1.  Gotta love Poundland.  Annoying, another game I bought not so long ago,  Project: Nomads  was also there, for exactly the same price, which was between a fifth and a tenth of what I paid.  The  Commando V3  write-up, as it is currently known, is coming along well.  It also reminded me of how good  GURPS Special Ops  is compared to  GURPS Covert Ops .  The former has lots of descriptions of special forces units, missions and tactics and a reasonable amount of gear.  The latter has loads of gear mainly covered by other books and surprisingly little else.  Both books have roughly the same page count.  Back to CV3.  FTL travel has now been finalised... for example, it takes about 90 (subjective) years to get from Sol to Altair.  The crew would experience about 9 of those, and probably less if they are in suspended animation.  I also expanded the timeline a little, but the whole thing is very "rough" at the moment and needs a lot of polishing.  My cat seems better today... I only hope he makes it through Monday's ordeal.

      My already complicated and generally annoying life has recently got more complicated and more annoying.  Yesterday I said my cat was ill.  This morning one of them passed blood.  Now both of them have been to the vets, and one of them has to have an operation... he is quite old and it requires a general anesthetic, so its not a good thing.  I also have to have an operation.  I am not old, but paranoid and terrified of death.  It also requires a general anesthetic.  Spooky, huh?  Both occurrences have me worried.  In addition, the cough I have been experiencing for the last 4-5 weeks is still with me, and that is beginning to worry me a great deal as well.  And I think my filling is starting to give up the ghost after about two years or so.  Roleplaying has gone a bit odd again.  As in, its not really happening.  It seems to be not happening more often than not these days.  Even my home game has been in brief hiatus as one of the players has decided to be useless again.  Also, my PC is still terrifying.  Or rather, the spyware and occasional failures that scare the shit out of me are terrifying.  At the very least my PBeM worries are out of the way.  I've also started work on the write-up for my revised "Future Commando" based  GURPS  game that I'd like to run but will never get the chance or indeed the right players.  I'm also getting money now.   Brood War  is going quite well also.  I've reached Protoss Mission 6 again.  Maybe this time I'll try and kill the proto-Overmind.  The Khalis crystal can wait.

      Incredibly, I did nothing today.  Must've been the weather... it was very drab and uninspiring.  I spent the day watching TV, reading, writing my PBeM and playing  Brood War .  One of my cats does not appear to be well, so it's causing concern.  He is apparently eating less and is definitely more lethargic than usual.

       Frasier  ended on terrestrial today, yet another casualty of this ongoing trend to axe every TV show I want to watch.  I can only hope someone comes up with something else, as shows like  Will & Grace  appear to have lost their edge (based on last weeks episode... the laughter seemed canned).  The pre-op assessment went well, with no needles involved.  Sadly, and predictably, they will be necessary for the actual operation.  Damn.   Armor  is looking up.  The style has become a little more sedate, and the mystery that is the chapter has been introduced.  Not so lucky for my  Lone Wolf  hunt... I thought I'd found one of the books nearby (relatively speaking), but alas, it has been sold.  The search continues...

       "And still very dangerous..."   Gotta love  Visionaries .  The quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired though.  Also, a new series of  Lexx  began last night, which is good, as it is usually highly amusing, and the episode did not disappoint in that regard.  How can the adventures of a spineless coward, a love slave, a dead man and a robotic head piloting a giant insect that can blow up planets be not good?  My pre-op assessment is less than 24 hours away... it probably involves needles and tests, so I'm not best pleased.  I have recently come to a realisation of something, however, I'm not going to post it here as this Blog is not totally anonymous.  Let's just say its not a good thing, and has built up over a number of days / years.  In other news, my acquisition of the  Lone Wolf  RPG has reignited my interest in the series.  I have decided to look for the last two books needed to complete my collection of the novels... it seems they are very hard to come by.  I even tried playing the first game book this afternoon... and met my end at the claws of Doomwolves on the road to Holmgard.  There's always next time.

      Had my own freak weather occurence today - fortunately, it didn't result in my being washed away... though it might have had it kept up.  So, I was out on my usual excursion to a local city, and was making my way back to the car as dark clouds loomed overhead.  I made it back and started for home as it started raining...  Then there was a "thunk" as something impacted with the windscreen.  And another.  It was hail.  And in the middle of summer here!  Hence it was an odd experience, driving in the summer, with the car heaters on to prevent condensation and the windows wound up... most unpleasant.  More pleasant was the continuation of  Armor .  After a shaky start I realised that the non-stop writing style conveyed the madness of the story very eloquently.  And it does have chapters... just 70+ page ones.  More out of curiosity, I picked up the  Lone Wolf Roleplaying Game  today, along with a second hand copy of  GURPS Fantasy Adventures .  The LWRPG seems interesting enough, and the authors have at least made the effort to separate it from d20 a little... I can't remember how much of the info is accurate though.  Its been a while since I read the Lone Wolf books.  The other book was cheaper, but the previous owner had seen fit to scrawl notes over some parts of the original text, which I found incredibly annoying.  I also got Forever Peace and Forever Free, so today has been quite an expensive one.  In other news, my other campaign didn't run... so the previous week was not a good week for roleplaying :(

      More roleplaying worries today.  After managing to have some half decent sleep, I have to drag myself up and out for a game thats supposed to run on the afternoon.  And I get there and find it has been cancelled, as half the players are missing.  So my afternoon was spent playing  UFO  (the original).  This evening was not much better... I did very little indeed.  However, in positive roleplaying news, I have revised an old  GURPS  campaign.  Back in my earlier RPG days, I ran what I now consider "probably the second worst game ever".  Second only to the travesty of Fighting Fantasy.  This game was known as TL10 Commando.  It was an excuse for the players to blast aliens with little sign of a plot.  It was hurried into production, and thus had no impact.  Although one of the players was originally going to play a robot that was essentially a walking mouth on legs.  A few years back I had some ideas of revising it but they didn't get very far.  And then, on Friday morning, I had many ideas.  Some have been scribbled down, and they might even make it to Word this time!  Not that I expect anyone will want to play it of course...   Frasier  ends this week... leaving me with very little to watch on TV.  I only have DVD's to keep me from going insane.

      I'm presently uncomfortable.  My throat is sore from hours of coughing, every cough makes my headache worse and I'm tired from lack of sleep.  To round it off,  Rifts  wa cancelled as 2/3 of the players would rather watch the football, relegating me to playing  UFO: Aftermath .  It has been a depressing day.  Not to mention starting to read  Armor  at last.  My initial thoughts:  (1) Compared with  The Forever War  and  Starship Troopers , Armor is written in a very frantic style at an almost breakneck pace.  While it might suit some people, it only serves to annoy me.  I prefer a more relaxed pace, that allows me to absorb the information I'm reading, not having it all thrown in my face at once. (2) The chapters are either insanely long or there aren't any chapters.  I skipped ahead 50 pages to see if there was one (I prefer reading by chapters) and found no evidence of such. (3) The page formatting is annoying, as the left page appears to disappear into the spine of the book, making it tricky for me to read.  It appears I have the 1984 printing, and I'm wondering if it has been reprinted at all?  The story itself is adequate... perhaps my expectations are too high or I'm simply coming down from the high of The Forever War.  At least I have 3 out of 4 replies for my  PBeM , and I completed  Starcraft  again today, after two and a half hours of struggle against the Overmind.  I dropped a nuke on the bastard, and four others next to its Hives... lots of fun.  This is my first 'legitimate' completion of the game... when I first got it, as I was close to the end, I bought  Brood War  (Starcraft's expansion) and wanted to play it.  I got more than a little frustrated with Protoss Mission 9 (" Shadow Hunters ") so I... err... skipped it, and completed Mission 10 (the last one, which was actually easier by comparison).  Since then, I've gone back and completed the game properly, including not skipping Protoss Mission 9.  I think I'll give Brood War another go... although the final few Zerg missions are nigh-on impossible...  Either that or its back to  Homeworld: Cataclysm .

      So, I visited my GP for the first time in years today.  It seems he isn't the "ogre" I remember him being... which was a good sign.  He also told me that my cholesterol level was "excellent", which was encouraging.  Nothing to be done about that damn cough, but its not as bad at the moment... I hope its getting better.  I also watched some of  Transformers  Season 2.  It seems I've been overtaken by nostalgia as its largely awful!  The scripts are appalling and the animation is often terrible.  Makes me wonder why I used to like it at all...  Didn't get round to starting  Armor .  Ah well.

       UNICRON   Well,  Armor , and not  Armour  after all.  It was more expensive than I imagined, which was odd.  Still, I hope Forever Peace and Forever Free aren't the same price.  As per usual, I'm lagging behind, and I only caught up with the end of  Dawsons Creek .  Although the final season strayed away from the place and concentrated more on the characters exploits around Boston.  I think.  The scriptwriters did some  interesting  things with the last two episodes... if you're a fan, you simply need to watch it.  Hell, if you're a fan, you've already watched it, and I'm rabbiting on for nothing.  So...  Rifts .  About 90% of the roleplayers I know hate it.  And why?  The rules.  They bleat on about the rules.  In my opinion, so long as the rules encompass more than combat (i.e. not  d20 ) and are at least readable and not trying to take the piss (i.e not  HoL ) then there shouldn't be any major problems.  Its the background that makes the difference.  The rules problems are of course multitudinous:  (1) Attributes are meaningless unless higher than 16 (2) The character and race selection is horribly spread out and by and large, massively duplicated (e.g. Headhunter, Headhunter Techno-Warrior, Headhunter Techno-Hound, Headhunter Assassin are all basically the same type of class - a fighter with bionic parts) (3) the books suffer from incredible power creep (in laymans terms, one book introduces one item, the next introduces something similar but more powerful, and so on) (4) Magic and Psionic powers are quite poor (5) The rules in general don't make a lot of sense and contradict themselves (6) Everything is Americanised (e.g. in America, the language is called "American" instead of English)  And thats just a small sampling!  However, the background is rich and varied, and there is plenty of scope for interesting campaigns.  What really annoys me is that, despite the fact that most of the above problems can be fixed by the GM, roleplayers I know still whine on about it.  Bastards.

      Finished  The Forever War  the other day.  In general, a very good book.  I think I'll be looking into getting its sequel and quasi-sequel, Forever Free and Forever Peace.  I can only hope they'll be as good.  It transpires that my  Armour  (or Armor) novel has turned up, but no-one was around to answer the phone call from Ottakars.  So I'll be getting it tomorrow.  Or today, depending on your time zone.  Did I mention I got the soundtrack from  The Day After Tomorrow ?  Well, if not, its excellent.  Very nice, although the order of the songs is a little strange.  Did I also mention I have a persistent cough?  It only really affects me on nights, so it stops me from going to sleep, and when I eventually drift off, I wake up late the next day.  Its really irritating.  My beard has also gone, and I can feel air on my chin again... which is simply odd.  This is in response to upcoming pre-ops and my finally getting a haircut.  I'm also very cross.  It seems  Mongoose Publishing , a group of OGL whores, have released  Lone Wolf  (by Joe Dever) as a roleplying game.  This is a bad thing, as this means it's  d20 .  For the uneducated, d20 is a system of roleplaying rules that promotes fighting, min-maxing and not roleplaying at all.  It works for  Dungeons & Dragons  excellently, but not for anything else.  I have some respect for Mongoose, as they are UK-based, which is a good thing, as the UK is not well known for roleplaying games anymore.  However, they do tend to convert everything I love from books and media to the godawful d20 system.  Like  Babylon 5 .  Why can't they make up their own system, or use a better one?  Like  GURPS ?  For the uneducated, GURPS is not a popular system.  I love it, as it encompasses everything I want from a system, character generation is detailed, has lots of rules covering everything, and its also mildly realistic.  Everyone else says it's too complicated to play, too difficult to make characters for, and even combat-centric!  I can accept the third point.  Next time...  Rifts .

      So I finally got to see  The Day After Tomorrow .  Despite the awkward seating position, it was well worth the wait.  The special effects were generally excellent, the soundtrack was typical but listenable, and the plot was believable enough.  I don't have any major gripes about it, so it rates 8.5 / 10.  I reckon I'll be off to get the soundtrack soon enough.  I also managed to finish the latest edition of my PBeM and send it on its merry way.  I'm interested to see what the players reactions will be...  Watched  "Half-Life in an Hour"  this morning... some of the tricks have to be seen to be believed.  Truly awesome stuff.

      It must have been a busy past few days, as I haven't posted anything.  Friday saw the continuation of  Rifts .  After some protracted running around, my beloved character was killed in a most unfair manner.  This prompted the creation of a new character.  Using a small portion of my knowledge of the system, I crafted a significantly effective character... and then was introduced to the other PC's.  Or more accurately, not.    The entire session was spent running around, trying to find the others, or being spied upon by them.  All in a days work for a Psi-Tech.  I also got the redesigned  PC Gamer .  It looks like they're back to using a font circa 1995, and the content, while slightly prettier, was altogether lacking.  I'm a minimalist when it comes to design.  A  GURPS  game started today.  It hasn't had the opportunity to get going yet, but I'm sure it has the potential to be good.  Still playing  UFO: Aftermath .  The human weapons show no signs of getting worse, while the alien ones are generally disappointing.  I even  dislike  the alien-human armour, as it looks too  icky .   WoD  has been moved to Tuesday next week, as the bloody football is on.  There are two things in this life I most definitely detest.  One thing is Collective Card Games.  The other is football.  Damn it.  Hopefully, tomorrow I'm off to see  The Day After Tomorrow , assuming I can wrangle the use of the car.  Fingers crossed...

      A week after the event, I have caught up with this seasons  ER  finale... typically insane as per usual.  But not as crazy as the episode with the tank!  Alas, I'll have to wait until next year to find out what happens.  I think the only series I'm watching now is  Frasier , and this season has slipped quite considerably.  Thank God for  Dead Ringers .  Ah, forgot about  Angel , about the only series I'm watching at the moment that has a hint of sci-fi about it.  Bring back  Babylon 5 !  Just watched  Jurassic Park III .  It was alright, and had some great references to the previous movies, but the effects looked very "tired".  The plane bit at the start looked positively wooden... on par with the helicopter crash in  DNA !  Tried to get my hair cut today, only to find the damn place was closed.  Also chanced walking through not one but two of my local parks... and was not accosted once.    Makes a change from December 1994.

       GURPS  ran for the second time in as many weeks this evening.  It may not sound impressive but based on the groups track record, it is.  My descriptions were somewhat dry, but the session itself was reasonable.   WoD  also ran yesterday, and a better session than the second as well.  The AWOL player returned, another disappeared, and another was childish as ever.  The core players did well as per usual.  Three problems with my GMing have been highlighted of late:  (1) My descriptions tend to suck, IMO.  I can picture events in my head, but getting them across to others is often tricky. (2) My campaign style is very similar from game to game - often involving the players in hopeless situations but usually winning through. (3) I usually critically underestimate how long it will take players to do things... something I envisage will last a single session can last four or more.  In other news,  The Forever War  is a very interesting book.  For anyone interested in "future war" style novels, I highly recommend it.

      Really.  Nothing happened today.  I was finally able to get some replies for my PBeM game, which is nice.  Not 100%, but close.  I've been having some new ideas for my potentially upcoming  Mage: The Ascension  game... my original idea was too similar to my older  GURPS: Supers  game.  The new idea has a workable backstory, but nothing to really go on.  I also need to do some more work on the  World of Darkness  game... it's slated to end in a few weeks and the ending(s) aren't actually finalised...  Whoops.  Have I ever mentioned  urlLink Amiga Remix ?  It's a marvellous site that contains remixes of great Amiga tunes.  I recommend most of the  Turrican  ones... they're ace.

      Another day where I didn't go online... in case anyone cares, I tend to post blogs relating to the previous day, e.g.  "Overkill"  was in relation to Friday, but posted on Saturday morning.  Almost nothing happened on Saturday anyway... Dawsons Creek ended, but I'm behind so I had to tape it.  As mentioned previously, it seems like all decent terrestrial TV is coming to an end, but thats the curse of summertime TV scheduling.  Only  Angel  and  Will and Grace  strive to keep me sane.  Made a character for a friends attempt at a dicelss roleplaying game.  Looks interesting enough, hopefully it will be.  Also discovered that I have a tendency to play suspicious and untrustworthy characters in particular cicles.  Quite true.  Played a little more  UFO: Aftermath .  Just got my hands on an FN-P90, so I'm somewhat pleased.  It appears human weapons are far more entertaining than the alien tech, as previously mentioned.  The only advantage alien guns have is range... they beat just about everything bar sniper rifles.  Finally, I got the forms relating to my financial worries, and appear to have been sent the wrong ones.  Thus it gets dragged on another week.  Ho hum.

      Rifts switched to a Friday this week... not a good thing as it happens.  The gaming area was the last word in discomfort, and the game... well.  The GM's interesting idea was to set the game solely within a city.  Those of you not familiar with Rifts will know it lends itself to travelling.  However, this isn't necessarily a problem.  The group consists of a mechanic, spy, mercenary and mage... the spy rarely involves himself with the group and the mercenary is far too busy chasing skirt to help anyone... so the mechanic tries a little affirative action, with the mage in support.  And they promptly get hit  VERY HARD  with GM Power.  The pair travelled to a nearby cave to hunt for the big bad guy, and found him.  Of course, said bad guy immediately used his ultra-spell, and virtually annihilated the two.  And then proceeded to kill the mage  after  the player went home.  Not a good state of affairs.  A word of warning... don't roleplay if the GM appears to have had a bad day.  I also visited the Doctors for a Health Check.  Yes, I'm overweight, I knew this already.  The pleasant surprise was the fact my blood pressure isn't sky-high.  I still feel awful after having blood drawn and the pressure check... I fear it is my rampant hyperchondria rearing its head.  Still playing  UFO: Aftermath  - its beginning to get difficult, which is annoying.  The missions usually wandering around with nothing to see, before blundering into a number of aliens who kick your ass.  Or occasionally, you wander around, see an alien, kill it, and the mission ends.  Odd.  The technology doesn't have as much "oomph" as its predecessor.  In UFO, when you got lasers or plasma guns you  knew  they were going to hurt - they were big, chunky and sounded nice.  The alien weapons in Aftermath are weedy.  The lasers actually look as if your soldier is launching a stream of piss at hir or her target... most uninspiring.    Even played a little UFO after I found a machine to make it work on... my "devil-may-care" attitude to troop mortality wasn't going down very well.  Its not my usual tactic, but I was in a hurry.  My second word of warning... should there be a nightmare future where I am a general, then you're probably safer defecting.

      Well,  Armor  is ordered now... although Ottakars tell me it could be "several weeks".  I guess we'll see.  Started reading  The Forever War .  At the moment its very similar to Starship Troopers... I don't like the idea of armour-mounted lasers though.  The amusing thing is the date... 1997.  The authour admits its a bit fantastic, considering it was written in the seventies.  Picked up  UFO: Aftermath  today, but haven't tried it yet.  Also got a Robert Rankin novel and the 6th in the Resident Evil series.  In a bizarre switch from Monday, I actually slept until 12.35pm... I don't do that often either.  I reckon its nerves.

      It was a vague Warcraft III reference, before you ask.  At long last my delayed  GURPS  game gets off the ground... again.  It has been delayed as the players are  somewhat unreliable .  Actually, thats a gross understatement.   Ninety Percent Unreliable  is a better way or putting it.  The game was good, as it has been for the past 10 years, with one player screwing up his charcters life in an amusing fashion, and the other trying to pick up the pieces.  Sadly, the first player always begins to "feel tired" and "has to be up early" the next morning, and thus the game invariably ends abruptly.  Today hasn't been very exciting really... I caught up with a few people I haven't talked to in a while, and also took another step toward securing additional finances.  I'm in the process of trying to order  "Armour"  by Jon Steakley.  Ottakars have been surprisingly inept at doing this, especially considering the speed at which they got a copy of  Starship Troopers  and one of the Warcraft novels in for me.  The book itself is apparently in the mold of Heinlein's classic... I can only hope it is true.  Yesterday morning, I finished reading  Transformers: Fusion .  It looks like  The Forever War  is going to be the 'reading successor'.  I'm really interested in the whole "future war with battlesuits" concept at the moment.  Oddly enough, the above GURPS game is kinda like that... coincidence?    Nah.

      Not very exciting events lead to a short Internet hiatus.  The problem began with Sunday, as I promptly forgot to update this.  Then the "Night of Terror II" began.  I'll explain.  About two weeks ago the first "Night of Terror" began, where my PC suffered all kinds of horrible mishaps and I was up until 3am fixing it.  This recent one wasn't as terrifying, merely extremely annoying.  Essentially, sleep was denied me until about 7am, which is a first for me I believe.  Add to this my WoD game on Monday night coupled with multiplayer Diablo II, this lead to me arriving home too late and too knackered to look at anything computer related.  At least I've found out the Necromancer rocks...    The WoD game was amusing, but the arrival of two new players and unexpected departure of one (no doubt due to third-paty meddling or sheer laziness) threw the existing group dynamic into chaos.  Sadly, one player is stroppy and petulant, and another simply "doesn't get it", and it simply doesn't make for a good experience.  In other roleplaying news, my online PBeM is not going very well.  Following a suggestion to have "floating returns" the entire system has broken down.  It seems structure needs to be enforced for things to work.  Also, my home GURPS game is going very badly... when one player can make it, the other manifests an excuse not to attend.  I'm sure they're in cahoots to drive me mad, the bastards.  It celebrates its 10th year in the next 3 months...  In short, at the moment, everything is a bit crap.

      That was today... still hot, and still I stopped in.  I managed to get the preliminary draft of  Heroland  completed, which was nice.  A lot of the text needs revision though, as it is not particularly well-written.  Additionally, I got a blast from the past - well, two actually, as I spent some time playing  Disposable Hero  and  Project X .  For those who don't remember, they are venerable Amiga shooters in the vein of  R-Type .  Great fun, but the Amiga emulator has an awkward key configuration leading to hand ache.  It also seems like  Do Over  on Channel 4 has entered a second season or something, as the title sequence has changed.  Wow, that was exciting.  Can we do it again?

      The other oft-delayed game ran yesterday, with a mere two players.  That's 40% of the original group, as one player has dropped out and the other two were unavailable.  Incredibly, the other player actually co-operated with someone (namely me).  This was the first time I've seen them do that, in any RPG they've been in.  Spooky.  I picked up  The Fifth Element  Special Edition and  Starship Troopers 2  today.  The latter is... interesting.  Imagine, if you will, Starship Troopers crossed with something like The Hole.  Very odd.  The weather has been uncharacteristically decent today... though there was the rumble of thunder and some rain earlier.   Heroland  is coming along well - they "final" version is presently under construction.

      On my fortnightly visit to that local city, I was lucky enough to find  Babylon 5  series 2 in the HMV sale... now that I have the first three seasons on DVD I can begin to watch the great series again.  I also picked up a number of  GURPS  books, along with a miscellaneous  d20  product entitled "Vigilance" (to assist with the development of  Heroland  if necessary).  Almost got the  Transformers  PS2 game, as it was in a  "Buy anything else and get this cheap"  offer, but I couldn't find anything else worth getting.  Ah well, where there's one GAME, there are two others nearby...

       I'm a bit pissed off...  Mage  was cancelled as one of the players decided to be lazy and not get her arse out of her house, despite being able to get a lift from the damn place, BY SOMEONE WHO LIVES THERE.  I decided, as it was only the second session, to cancel it until next week, and if she doesn't bother then, she is ejected from the game and I'll have to struggle on regardless.  Additionally, the return of the oft-delayed game was not as exciting as anticipated.  I can only hope it gets better.  And not much else has happened.   Aliens  is on tonight, which is a good thing... interesting to see the non-special edition again.

      Today was actually interesting for a change...  The oft-delayed  GURPS -esque game actually ran, although at a glacial pace, so we didn't really get anywhere.  I watched  Shrek  again... it was just as funny the second time around, if not more so.  And then I went to see  Shrek 2 .  It was fantastic, and slightly edged out the original.  Obviously, it wasn't as novel, but the story was good, the graphics slightly improved, and there were many more references and in-jokes.  Additionally, following yesterdays RPG discovery, I came up with a game I probably could have written in 24 hours, if I had 24 hours to myself.  The game is provisionally titled " Heroland ", and allows players to create and play super heroes (or villains) of any type.  The main draw to the system is simplicity - a character can be created in a short space of time, and powers are easy to figure so long as the player has an idea what they want to do.  I bet I'll get bored quickly.

      Today's game didn't run, as only two players showed up / were able to play.  At least we got some XP for our troubles.  I found an interesting site today on RPG's -  24Hour RPG .  The premise is simply to generate an entire roleplaying game, system, setting and all, in the space of 24 hours.  I only had a quick look, so I'm not sure if you're supposed to run it immediately afterward... I guess you'd have to, otherwise there'd be no point, would there?  I think I'd like to try that some time.   Fallout 2  is progressing well, but I fear I may have messed up one of the quests big time, which is not good, as its the main quest of the game.  Oops.   UFO  is also going quite well, although those damn Ethereals are annoying me constantly.  And the Snakemen.  Damn them.  Just got actually useful psionics, which is handy.  Haven't tried them out though.  And finally, an apology to anyone reading yesterdays post... I went off on a tangent about "Boobah" and wasn't able to stop... sorry.

      Well, what could I have been doing for the past two days?!  Your guess is as good as mine.   Fallout 2  saw a lot more progression... its beginning to get to 'depression level' again.  This hapens occasionally with games that I play.  Let me explain.  Some games are very in-depth and detailed.  And if I play them enough, I suddenly realise I have an awful lot of stuff to do in the game, and this leads to my inherent laziness, and not actually wanting to do those tasks.  Fallout 2 managed to do this before.  The worst offender was  Planescape: Torment .  I got about 10 screens in, and then suddenly realised  everything  had an individual description.  Every item.  Every NPC>  realising just how much I had missed, I turned it off, uninstalled it and never played it again.  In other news, a RPG that has been delayed for months might actually begin this weekend.  I'll believe it when I see it.  Speaking of RPG's, my ideas for  Exalted  continue, but actually finding people to play is proving more tricky.  It seems my GMing appeals to a "selected" crowd, and others have no time / interest.  Hrrmph.  Watched some more  Transformers ... and I saw the episode "Kremzeek".  After the first 10 minutes, I was praying that it would end.  But it didn't... it seemd to go on forever.  It was the worst episode of a cartoon series I have ever seen... I wish it to be stricken from my memory.  Like Boobah.  WHAT THE F**K IS BOOBAH?  I mean, what are they?  Another odd RPG idea sprang into to my head, relating to this, based on an off-hand comment by my Mam.  What if the Teletubbies were the sole survivors of a nuclear war, locked away in their bunker, and then those Boobah things invaded?  It could make for a really odd RPG.  I should stop having ideas.

       Mage  ran on Monday night, and thus there was no update... it went quite well.&nbsp; Hopefully its running at a far more suitable location next week, which would be nice.  &nbsp;  Played some  Fallout 2  recently, and I managed to advance the plot quite considerably.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't exactly know what to make of it all, as theres an awful lot to take in.  &nbsp;  Managed to catch up on Angel, and even a bit of  Armor , which I have been reading (very slowly) for the last month or two.&nbsp; Reading is really quite difficult at the moment, and its really beginning to annoy me.  &nbsp;  Caught half of two episodes of  Without a Trace  - it seems a lot better than I credited for.&nbsp; A lot like CSI, but I think they're both made by the same production company.  &nbsp;  Bought the  Lord of the Rings  movie soundtrack trilogy set (its been in the HMV sale for some time now).&nbsp; Generally adequate music, but the little ridge / teeth things inside  all  of the cases were broken or damaged.&nbsp; The 'best' one is  Return of the King , which has only one tooth remaining.&nbsp; A bit like Gollum I suppose.  &nbsp;  In other news, I have some plans for an  Exalted  game, but I really need to read the book, which, of course, I can't.&nbsp; Exalted is White Wolf's new cash cow, and is a sort of heroic fantasy type game, with all sorts of backstory, intrigue and so on.  &nbsp;  Only problem is that no-one runs it that way anymore.  &nbsp;  I aim to change that.

      Not much to say... opticians appointment has me going back in 3 weeks... it would've been 2 but the place is fully booked.  So I'll not be driving / reading properly until at least August.  And on 8 drops a day until then.  More  Fallout 2  fun... it seems one can get a lot further with a high Intelligence and Speech skill... still having trouble with a particular quest though.  Also went to the town, and my watch works again, which is nice.  It's not been an exciting day really.

      Not in the common sense but... today I managed to visit that local city that does roleplaying.   But wait?  Didn't you just have an eye operation that probably prevents you from driving?  I hear you cry.  Correct.  Fortunately, I have a friend who drives.  And likes roleplaying.  I picked up  Rifts: Dinosaur Swamp  - it doesn't look *too* good but I'm an obsessive completist.  I also got seasons 1 and 3 of  Babylon 5  on DVD, as they were in the HMV sale.  Still looking for Season 2 on the cheap, and waiting for Season 4 to come down in price.  And for Season 5 to be released...  Got round to watching  Star Trek: Nemesis  again... a reasonable film, but they could have done a lot more with it.  Also a pity so many scenes were cut.  Not much else happening... I have another opticians appointment tomorrow.

      Well, not really.  Another day, another game.  Today was that diceless RPG with a conspiracy theme... isn't going well thanks to one of the players being and arse and another playing one.  Additionally, there was more Fallout 2.  Or more accurately, a repeat of such.  I decided my leveling up and Perk selection was a poor choice... so I went back to my closest save and did it all again... of which there was a lot.  The crowning achievement was killing the Rat God in a single aimed headshot with a shotgun... not an easy feat when you're a close combat expert.  I've also become far more averse to my god-damn eyedrops.  Its now beginning to really piss me off.

      I returned to GMing, albeit briefly, today.  My  DSR  roleplaying system needed a final test for particular area - combat.  The test campaign was my old Alien Powers game from quite some time ago - a space game with incompetent captains, ships that don't work and bizarre alien races.  Combat was difficult.  For one, my presently poor eyesight made reading the rules I had written tricky.  This was compounded by the poor lighting conditions of the roleplaying area.  Further hampered by PC incompetence, the test served to highlight two things:  (1) Combat is very slow if you don't know the rules (2) There are two states if you get hit - intact or dead  Some revision needs to made, methinks.  In addition, some more  Fallout 2  was played... I'm beginning to like the game, although I constantly wish I'd made slightly different character choices... like CHA 7 and END 6 instead of CHA 8 and END 5, no 'Finesse' and 'Scout' Perks, and so on.  I've also discovered a better way of taking my eyedrops that minimises discomfort.  Note "minimises" - its still bloody uncomfortable.  No updates on the PBeM either.

      First, Blogspot appears to be acting up, for me at least, and refusing to post submissions, no matter how much I hit "Refresh".  Odd that.  The last few days have been uneventful.  My sight continues to improve, although the drops and stickiness of the eye on mornings is irritating.  I finally saw some of my associates, although few of them actually bothered to find out how I was, which was most disappointing.  Also disappointing is the response to my PBeM, which has not been great.  I got to play some more  Fallout 2  today, which was nice.  I also got  UFO  working again... I think the main executable must've been corrupted.  Work continues, "up here" ( points to head ) on my forthcoming  Mage  campaign, and the other games haven't been running of late.  I've also been watching some season 2  Transformers , and for the most part, its awful.  Makes me wonder why I bought the boxed sets at all...

      At the moment anyway.  Well, I can see enough to type this, but I have no idea as to what I'm actually typing.  to further enhance the fun, I weon't use tje spell checker.  It'll make an interesting read for later on I reckon.  My days are now spent doing very little, 'cause I can barely see.  Thus no reading, no sustained Pc use, no TV... only music and sleep.  The pain isn't helping.  The throat pain is now accompained with the eyedrops running down there (did you know that the tear ducts, nasal passages and throat are all connected?  No?  Now you do), my hand still aches and the eye... don't get me start3d on the damn eye.  Not much else to report... I hspoke to some people, and wasa ctually called by a friends to see how I was doing... ha first, believe it or not.  Going to see my optician tomorrow... hopefully some things will be sorted.  Then its a struggle to see whether I make it to Fridays roleplaying game or not...  Joy.

       "I live... again."   Today's quote sponsored by Cain, from the  Blood  series.  The operation was a success, but now the hard work begins.  You have no idea how much impact such an event can have on your life until it happens.  There's the constant pain and irritation, the inconvenience of not being able to wash that area properly, and of course the difficulty of not being to see properly because of it.  I type now with considerable difficulty thanks to three layers of protection between my eye and the outside world...  The actual event was terrifying... and it took quite a while for things to happen as well.  The operation was delayed for an hour, as was my discharge, so in total I was in hospital for about 11 hours.  Not groovy.  And then came the problem with sleep, and much, much leaking, which contributed to the lack of sleep, and so on... in a vicious cycle.  And don't get me started on the damn drops...  However, I made it, and am now alive to go on and sample the delights of the new editions of  World of Darkness  and  GURPS .  Rejoice!

      Well, my hour approaches... in less than 24 hours, my operation will commence.  I'm not kidding when I say I have a lot of apprehension about this... I can only hope it goes well.  I spent my time today doing very little of anything.  The cat went to the vet for a checkup following his operation, and he was alright.  So, if he was emulating me by having an operation, then I should, by extension, be alright as well.  If anyone has been following this, thanks for reading.  I should return soon to post more exciting events.  If not, then I shall leave with the end of a quote.    "...the rest, is silence."

      Well, seems like I haven't posted for a while... quite true.  For one reason or another I simply haven't been online to post, or have simply forgotten.  Thursday saw the acquisition of the 'new' RPG  A/State .  Its an interesting percentile based cyberpunk game, set in a decaying city containing a myriad of mixed technologies.  The poor use gas lamps and flintlocks, the rich have hovercars and gauss cannons.  Also got was the  Black Hawk Down  soundtrack and  Gone in Sixty Seconds  on DVD... which I found £2 cheaper an hour later.  Additionally, I saw a friend I rarely see, and did very little but talk.  He all but reinforced my dislike of everyone who likes to run "exclusive" games... which accounts for several people I know.  It's a great source of frustration for me.  Friday saw a new RPG begin - a friends diceless system.  I don't see why it needs a playtest when there are no rules and only the skeleton of character generation.  The game itself was alright, but slow and mired by annoying "roleplaying".  Saturday saw several hours of  Red Alert 2  being played... I haven't played it on "Normal" before, and its surprisingly easy.  I also  nearly  completed the second mission of Freespace 2 on Insane difficulty... not as easy as you'd think.  Those Loki's are damn fast.  Sunday included a rare visit to my Uncle's house and also many hours of  Fallout 2 .  After a recent article in PC Zone ("Games that changed the world") I thought I'd give the game another go.  So far I can kill Gecko's, but actual human enemies cause a problem, and despite having a gun, my character can't shoot for toffee.    Best stick with the spear then.  The operation looms ever closer... there is likely to be one more post before it happens, and then... who knows?

      ...of the situation.  At least I have plenty of time to watch films these days.  I watched  Minority Report  yesterday... it was a decent film, with some interesting twists and plot developments.  The special effects were nicely done... the technology was also interesting... for someone who plays  GURPS  anyway.  This afternoon I watched  AI .  That was a far better film, at least in terms of emotional involvement.  It painted a very interesting picture of psychological development and sociological interaction, and was riveting from start to finish.  Although the end was more than a little far-fetched.  At last I got to watch an entire episode of  Without a Trace , as a new series has started on terrestrial.  I was most impressed, and am somewhat pleased to have found something new to watch.   Lexx  is getting a little... depressing, but  Angel  is as gripping as ever.  How could it have been cancelled?  The weekend RPG ran as usual, though it was, once again, a little lacking.  Plus it doesn't have many sessions left, and lots of new players are being introduced.    AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Started reading  Forever Peace  by Joe Haldeman.  Although not a true sequel to  The Forever War , it "examines the same issues".  It's looking interesting at the moment.  The story is about a man who pilots remotely operated combat robots via some kind of neural link, and his interaction with others.  At the moment.  Today saw a climatic change, from warm and sunny to warm and raining.  There was even some thunder this morning, so it heralds in the Autumn.  Well, at least I won't have to put up with this damn heat.

      An interesting day today, as I managed to drive for the first time since my operation.  Driving was probably about as easy as before the operation... maybe a little improved.  The reason?  I went to see  Thunderbirds .  It wasn't particularly bad, but obviously not up to the calibre of the likes of  The Day After Tomorrow ,  Shrek 2  or  Spiderman 2 .  The CG was reasonable, the plot acceptable if a little hackneyed, the acting unnoticeable.  The main thing that ruined it was the annoying child sitting behind me asking his parents every two seconds what was going on.  I suppose that's the drawback of going to see what is essentially a kids film.  Also went back to  Fallout 2 .  I'm a bit worried about the plot.. it seems to be getting progressively more and more worrying / depressing.  Plus it crashed on me at least twice, and these were game killing crashes.   That  RPG is running tomorrow... I do hope it picks up.

      Not a great deal was done today... argued a lot, watched some TV, and also had some time with which to play  Enter The Matrix  and  Final Fantasy X .    Did I mention I hate Blitzball?

      I wonder if anyone noticed?  I find it hard to believe, as I doubt many people read this blog... never mind.  Otherwise, answers on a postcard to some random email address.  Visited a new bookshop in town today... a very depressing place.  Still, there were three of the Lensman series there - a series I recently became interested in following the acquisition of  GURPS Lensman .  And at only £1 a book I couldn't refuse.  Of course, the books were #3, #4 and #6.  Not much use, but a decent start anyway.  In case you hadn't guessed, I like to start at the beginning and work my way through.  that's why I'll only re-read the Lone Wolf series once I have the final two missing books.  I think its going to take me a while.  I also watched  The 13th Warrior  for the first time today.  I reckoned it was OK, and a decent example of what films can achieve without flashy CG effects.  It was interesting in that a friend once based a one-off RPG based on the movie.  In case anyone has seen the film and knows what on earth I'm talking about, my character surfed the river bit on the back of a whale.  Don't ask.  Finally, I've been having some ideas for renovation of my long-running GURPS campaign.  I tend to come up with new ideas every few months, and each revision keeps getting better and more refined.  Its been a "work-in-progress" for a decade now, so I'm very proud of what has been achieved.  Now, if only I could get the actual game to run!

      Well, some better news for me...  (a) my eyedrops are down to 3 a day from 8 (b) I can get a new prescription for glasses  Additionally, the balance changes for  Heroland  worked, for the most part.  I still need to work on how much powers cost to use, and how much power a player has available to use them.  Managed to get some time on  UFO: Aftermath , and saw the crazy "Collapsible Railgun" in action.  Basically, its a mobile fire support weapon of hideous range and power... BUT... the trooper assigned to it is reduced to a crawl.  Not the best of situations if you're on the receiving end of an alien acid missile.  Also managed to kill  Incubation  by installing the mission pack.  Fixed it by deleting the whole lot and reinstalling.  Sadly, after the first few missions, it becomes veeerrrrrrry boring.  In the long term, things are looking grim.  For me, anyway.  Not a good sign.

      A veeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyy slow day today... spent most of it in bed, as it happens.  Highlights of the day involved Andromeda re-runs and later on,  Reign of Fire .  I saw it at the cinema, and have owned it for about a year on DVD, but never got round to watching it.  I was surprised at how much CG technology has progressed in the few years since its release.  Or maybe money is a factor...   The Bourne Identity  comes next methinks... just in time for its sequel which is due out soon.  Now  that  is something I've got round to watching.

      I'm pissed off with everything and everyone at the moment.   Mage  was a disaster.  I'm was missed out for an outing AGAIN.  Games will be delayed this week thanks to certain individuals.  At least I got round to watching  The Fifth Element .   Heroland  saw some revisions, but I haven't had the time or personnel to test them out yet.  It'll probably be a few months, like  DSR .  Otherwise, life is a bit shit at the moment.

      Its been a pretty normal weekend.  I went to see  Spiderman 2  a few hours ago.  I was most impressed... it had a good plot, to which the special effect were actually secondary, the acting was reasonable and the script believable.  8.5 / 10, and better than the first.   Heroland  v1.1 was finished this afternoon, and I got a friend of mine to test it.  As expected, there are problems.  Powers are too expensive and weak, and Super Stats are far too good for their cost... I intend to make some tweaks for whenever I get a new test going.  The oft-delayed RPG got a second run in as many weeks... it was alright but nothing exciting.  I'm having difficulty adjusting to my character, and it all seems a bit slow.  I wonder if the second group got to do more?  The game involves time travel, and presently, the disappearance of an entire city.  Given the groups inherent paranoia (spilling over from the previous game), I suggested that we may be the ones responsible - saving the city... from us?  I managed to get a short game on  UFO: Aftermath , and met the feared "Alien Rocket Launcher" and even more feared "Microslug Accelerator".  Basically, they're advanced alien weapons that blow the hell out of your troops.  The tech boys are hard at work developing new and more deadly versions though.  And mind control works!  Speaking of mind control,  UFO  is going much better, and my psionic task force is becoming one to be feared.  Floaters, Reapers, Snakemen and Mutons fall to my mind powers easily!  The best event was the "Mexican standoff" between three Sectoids.
