      Hey guyz.. well sorry i havent been posting.. yeah ive either been away or too lazy to post.. well yesterday was great haha yeahh soooooo kool i think it was the best day of my life hahahha wellz yesterday I went to the mall with my babaez.. haha and her friends.. and bobby, and seth. yeah i had lots of fun.. we "saw" a movie hahaha and i barely knoe anything about it.. but i can tell the story!! hahahaha wellz i got nothin else love you  babez !!    LATER    ~OliveR~    Thinking of her to me is like a dream you never want to end. Thinking of me to me is a nightmare that wont end. Thinking of the two of us together to me is wonderful and even more I hope to be on the neverending side but when you do wake up your heart feels like it ran into walls all night long with the lights off in a daycare room full of obtacles.....that is what how I feel about her...  As I look at the stars at night and dream of what is to be... My heart begins to smile for it is you I see. Knowing that you're close but yet so far away. I dream of you at night and think about you every day. For every moment without you seems like an eternity. I dream of the day we kiss and I can hold you close to me. So until that day comes you'll always be on my mind. And I will love you till the end till the end of time.  love you  babez !!     LATER     ~OliveR~

Today Today i woke up at 9:00 a.m. RUNNING LATE!!! so i got up, changed, then watched some t.v and then i saw chainsaw massacre.. but it was really more bloody and gorry than it is scarry.. haha so i went to watch a documentary on killer bees haha. then we checked out of the hotel and went to go eat lunch at a chinese restaurant. DIM SUM BAABY!! took us an hour to eat. and then we stopped by auto zone because my uncle's mirror broke off and he had to glue it back on.. so me, my brother, my sister, and my dad went to 7-Eleven across the street and got slurpees for the road.. and there was traffic but it cleared out.. but while my dad was driving he got sleepy so we had to go to a rest stop and then we were back on the road.. for like 2 hours then we stopped again at a gas station at victorville then we took an hour to get straight to church and we were like 10 mins. late yeah and i saw ppl at church like kat, yvette, rachel. ect.ect. yeah. well thats the end of my story!!
