      Welcome to the Summer Theatre Conservatory's very first blog!  Anyone in our class can post here, and you're all encouraged to do so often.  There are two primary things to post here:  Actor Journals:  Every day, I'd like you to write a bit about what you noticed, felt, learned, or failed to learn in class. Write however much you feel you should.  Some days you may have a brilliant insight and write five pages of dazzling rhetoric, some days you might not be able to summon up more than "blech, try back tomorrow."  But do put some thought into your journals.  I used to despise journal writing with a volcanic passion, until I started looking back on the old journals I was forced to keep during actor training and realized how much valuable insight was in there that I'd forgotten over the years.  Trust me, you'll want to have a record of this time in the future, and the blog will be archived and available whenever you want it.  Also, for those of you who aren't as comfortable sharing your experiences, go ahead and just keep a personal journal on paper, that works too, but do keep the record.  Random banter:  Use this blog to keep other members of the ensemble informed about what's going on in your life and in the theatre world.  Do you have a recital coming up you'd like us to see?  Post it here.  Did you read a review of a play that made your blood boil? Post it here.    As always, remember the one essential rule of theatre: We are an ensemble.  We support and respect one another.  That is as true with what we write on here as with what we do on stage.  But you knew that already.  So, we now begin a noble experiment, a venture to the shores of digital communication, a grand voyage through... blah, blah, blah.  Go blog.  Ian

      The group skits we did today were very interesting, and I enjoyed them all.  It was a challenge to portray an emmotional Greek scene (from Euripides), but it was a good experience to work with something non-traditional, classic, and ancient!  I liked how our guest, Jan gave each group a play from a different time period.  Also, I feel like everyone is making great progress in Twelfth Night.  It's only our third day, and yet many people have lines memorized and our blocking is almost complete!  I think it's awesome that we've accomplished as much as we have in just our third day- so I'm sure the good work will continue.  Go us! haha  Oh yeah, and for the record, I loooove the question game and the "which/what" game!

      Hi, ya Well I loved improv on Tuesday, I liked the "emotion party" game because unlike its brother the "party game."  This was based on interactions between the two characters rather than displaying a certain character or feature. On Wednesday I like being able to portray a character and the shoes did help me get a greater  grasp of his character.

      First and foremost, I want to tell you all how excited I am to be part of this program and how impressed I've been with your talent and your enthusiasm for Twelfth Night.  I've had a lot of fun going through the text with you all these past two days and I've definitely learned a few new things about the play from your insightful comments.  Second, I invite you all to browse over the notes I've written thus far for our text.  They're arranged by page number, and include everything from the meaning (and pronunciation) of "grize" to an untangling of some of the canny language Viola uses in Olivia's court.  I decided to put the notes on a separate message board so that they don't take over this blog (they're a little long).  Here's the address:    textstc.blogspot.com   Until tomorrow!

      Hey guys. This whole blog thing seems like a great idea. *claps for Ian* I loved working with words today. It's always hard to remember that there are infinite ways to say any line and that you should experiment with how you say your lines. I find it hard to make sure that an audiance understands what's going on in a shakespeare play because the launguage is so different from what we hear everyday, and emphasizing different words with different feeling behind them can really help people understand what you're trying to say. And working on breathing from your diaphram was also really helpful in figuring out how to project.   This whole experiance so far has been a blast and let's hope it continues to be.

       First off, I'd like to say that Ian Finley is the worst director I've ever worked with. And if you're still reading this post you'll find that I'm actually not serious about the previous sentence. I was just throwing a few of those "word daggers". I really enjoyed the breathing/relaxation exercise today. It's great to get all that tension out of the body before working. To quote Verbal Kint: "That guy's tense. Tension is a killer." We should do that exercise at the start of rehearsal every day. Well, toodles.

      I'm very excited by the level of talent in STC this year.  You guys rock!  I haven't seen much yet, but what I have seen is very exciting.  I know you are going to love the remaining workshops and I'm pretty certain we're going to have a TWELFTH NIGHT for the ages.  Congrats to all and thanks to Long Tall Ian for doing so a great job.

      Ok, so it goes a little like this:  I ask a question, then you comment on the post asking a question, and then someone comments and asks another question, but HERE'S THE CATCH: It has to make sense.  I mean, come on, we're sitting at home, there's plenty of time to think.  So every question has to in some way respond to the question before (like "What are you wearing?" "Do you like it?" "Do I have to?").  So, first question:  Has Anybody Seen My Duck?

      It is amazing how much I learned from Preston today. Acting as a career was always been a bit intimidating because of how little I knew about it, especially the whole part about going to NYC to work, and whether or not that's a good decision.  He was hilarious to listen to and so informative as well. I just spent an hour completely re-doing my resume, taking out all the dates, adding directors, and putting everything in columns (which took 75% of that hour). What he said about the casting director wanting you to be good has been told to me several times before, but i never believed it because everyone who told me that could never explain it, and Preston could.  And everything he said about auditioning and monologues seems so obvious now that I think about it.  Doing a upbeat monolgue is such a brilliantly obvious idea, I can understand why it doesn't occur to about 99% of the acting population.   But anyway, this week rocked completely. I've learned so much and had a blast. Let's top it with next week!  Annie  PS- I think it would be a good idea to make a list of good plays and playwrites that the cast should read sometime- for both the knowledge of the play and a good audition monologue. If you have someone or something you think the cast should read, please put it in a comment

      Heya guys.  I loved everything Preston Lane had to say today, he has some really great insight into the world of theatre.  A couple things I wanted to add to what he'd mentioned about auditions:    Definetely do wear clothes that are appropriate for the character you're auditioning for, but don't "costume" for the part.  I was watching people audition for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest back in Utah and this woman came in, dressed in a nurse's uniform, with the little hat and everything.  It was all the director could do to keep from laughing hysterically at her.  She didn't get the part.  It's definetely best to do a monologue that's directed at another person, but please, please, don't set an empty chair in front of you and pretend the person is in that chair and play your scene to the chair.  Maybe this is just me, but it makes me feel the character is insane, talking to an empty chair.  Instead, put your imaginary scene partner standing downstage left or downstage right or somewhere beyond the auditioner's table, but don't play to a chair.  And I'd suggest only doing monologues you wrote yourself if you're completely confident they're good, that they sound like a monologue from a published play, and I'd say to make up some author's name and say he wrote it.  I've auditioned with pieces I've written before, but only after I've run the monologue by a couple of my painfully honest friends and they've agreed that it's good material, and then I always say the monologue is from "Tempus Fugit" by Anatoly Domokov.  No, Anatoly Domokov doesn't exist.  Why do this?  Well, as soon as a director hears its an original piece part of his brain is going to start trying to judge the quality of the piece, as well as your skill as an actor.  I think it's a psychological thing, it's just going to happen, and you want all their attention focused on You the Actor (that's the part that'll get you a job) and not You the Writer (which is a distraction).  So only use original material when you know it'll help make your audition easier, not provide another obstacle.  Again these are only my opinions, but they go along with what Mr. Lane was saying, and I thought they were worth bringing up.  Now go memorize :)  Ian

      I'd have to say that Preston Lane was probably my favorite part of this week. It's such a relief to know that casting directors are not inhuman monsters. Unfortunately, most of the monologues I know are from dark and depressing(but never the less awesome) plays. I'll just have to look around some more. I appreciate Preston's honesty about breaking into the business and the way he didn't try to sugar coat things. The part about what casting directors *don't* want to see in a monologue was hilarious.   The more I look at the character of Orsino, the more interesting he becomes. He, like Olivia, is a victim of the virus unrequitedloveous. He is selfish, but develops a bond with Cesario, that goes beyond just man to man, that I am not sure he is fully aware of until Viola reveals herself. He is moody, stewing in melancholy one moment, and exploding in a murderous rage the next. Olivia brings out the vulnerable side in him, as he only gets up the courage to face her directly at the end of the play. He is a complex multilayered character that I am not sure I am entirely sympathetic to. That being said, I look forward to perfecting the last scene, as it's all about the timing and the relationships with people on stage.

      Yo guys, i wish you all could have been there. The student run (a showing just for students and teachers with valid id) of The King and I with Lou Diamnon Phillips was absolutely awesome. I thought it especially ironic that the only people who had to call for a line were Anna and the King. I was absolutely marveled by the fact that even as they asked for line, they stayed in character. I honestly think that the student performance was another way of saying "lets make money on the dress rehearsal". It was still awesome though. My favorite moment in the whole production is when Tuptim (the girl who tries to run away)is caught and returned to the king. It goes from this extreme high in "Shall we Dance" to this intensely dark moment where the king is infurated and ready to whip Tuptim, all the while arguing with Anna, which only adds to his anger. I also was given a chance, in the Q&A session after the play, to ask Mr. Phillips a question that I meant to ask during the S.A.G. conversations, which was this: "If you could choose any one of your favorite books to be made into a movie that you could act in, what book would that be?" Lou hemmed and hawed, and listed a few books I didn't know at all and can't remember to save my life, but his final answer was The Davinci Code. He then commmented that they would give that role to Hanks, or Denzel. Oh well, Lou, keep up the good work anyway.

      Ciao tutti!  I have now posted all my notes for both acts.  Please try to peruse these notes when you get a chance, I think everyone could learn at least a thing or two (I certainly did when I looked many of the definitions and references up).  And if you have any further questions about the text, please don't hesitate to ask!  For the notes, go to:  http://textstc.blogspot.com/   Erin

      I was going to keep my journal on paper, but I rethought it and here I am, so.... Today was fun.  I liked working on different postures.  Even more though, I liked making our characters "more complex" by interacting with others and noticing how different music will effect our character.  Ian keeps telling us to go with our natural instinct.  I'm still working on that.  My brain has a tendency to get in the way of letting my natural impulses just go, but it'll improve.  I also liked working with the words and experimenting with different ways to say our lines.  I'm excited about tomorrow and can't wait to experiment and perfect the scenes.  Hasta.

      I loved the View Points work today.  It was so interesting to figure out how to move my body in space, and work with tempo and levels and relationships. It's really interesting to think about the different stories that pop up just from reactions between people.  I think it might have been good to work a little bit more with different parts of the body leading, because you can lead with any part of the body-from the tip of the nose to the back of the left knee joint. But it was still interesting to think about the different personalities that goes along with leading parts. I think we should also work more on touch and how it can be used in acting.  I've noticed young actors have trouble touching and when you're in plays that involve two people kissing, those two people end up feeling horrible because they are made fun of, and they're already in an uncomfortable position. Just some thoughts.. Annie

      Not much to say, but that I enjoyed learning some of the complexities of Shakespeare's language and I look forward to looking into the text in more depth.  I also look forward to continuing the blocking for Act I because I had so much fun just watching everyone try new things with their characters.  Very funny stuff.

      I'd have to agree with Annie in saying I was blown away with info today. What can I say, were both the same person. Anyways, there was so much to take in about the meaning of all the vowels and remembering that the last word of each line is the most important and tempo and volume...maybe I'm just slow...i'll have a cup of tea.  Still, I was again amazed with all that Shakespeare put into his writing, no wonder they have classes just on his writing. Oh, speaking of Shakespeare being amazing, I remembered reading about some people thinking he was actually a woman. I found it on a website too so check it out: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5250890/site/newsweek/   Since I've missed writing for the past week, I'll go ahead and say some stuff about earlier days. I'd have to say my favorite day was last Tuesday with Greg Hohn. I had a blast with improv. I gotta admit I wasn't looking forward to it. In middle school we overdid improv and everyone was trying so hard to be funny, oh it was just a disaster. Until that day, I dreaded doing improv, but now I love it! I also really enjoyed listening to Preston last Thursday. I learned soooo much, back and front page of notes. I was really happy to get tips about auditioning. I've taken an audition class before, but learned triple the info from Preston. He was a real joy to listen to. Last Friday I really loved loosening up on stage. I felt very odd at first and felt that everyone was watching me but soon enough I lost those feelings and just went with my impulses. I didn't get what Ian said about becoming a shape, but I did enjoy experimenting with tempos and using all parts of my body in acting. I think Friday really helped with becoming Toby in the play, so Thanks Ian! Great ideas! Till next time...

      The Shakespeare work today was completely over-whelming. It's so mindboogling to think of exactly how complex each line of shakespeare is and the hundreds of mulipule levels and ways you can interpret it. It makes one want to run screaming in the other direction. You have to take so much into account when reading it, let alone speaking it. not only do you have tempo and volume and inflection and all that-you've got to factor in the language and the hints he gives in the text, and what he's actually saying and what the text is saying and character and it's just scary.  But it was extremely helpful and informative. Ian should teach english. Blocking was so much fun today. I don't know how we do it but this cast seems to have a great time no matter what its doing. Blocking can be the most boring thing in the world besides music theory class and so how this cast turns it into a fun thing to do. With everyone's ideas and jokes, it goes by so fast and it's kind of sad when the day ends.  I hope we continue to laugh through out the rest of the two weeks. Annie

      Wow, what can I say. Today was fantastic. I really lost myself today in the Viewpoints Exercise especially when the music was added. I was not self-conscious at all; and I don't mean the "people might think I'm a bad actor" kind of a self -conscious but the "is what I'm doing right for the character" self-conscious. I now feel much more comfortable moving around the stage when acting with others, I sort of felt nailed to the floor earlier in the week. I would also like to add that Rachel is doing an awesome job of working on Sir Toby. He(she?) was much less inhibited both physically and vocally today.   I know that people take Shakespeare different ways, but I always pictured Malvolio saying the line "I'll be revenged on the pack of you!" like an melodrama villain. You see, my theory is he runs off and changes his identity to Iago(so *that's* why he's so diabolical)!

      First off, playin with statuses (how do you spell that??) was a lot of fun! especially those skits, hillarious!! About those animals...very tough! I had a lot of trouble with those activities but I liked Annie's idea of Toby being a crab so perhaps next time it'll be more fun. It was interesting to learn that everything we say has a motive and most of the time we don't even know it, but it's so true! I enjoyed the activities we did trying to move people. I had some difficulties figuring out how to get Claire to think greatly of me, how do you do that? But by watching other people I learned a lot about what works and doesn't. Even though I was a bit restless during rehersal, I liked watching the first act. It's good to watch your twin and see how they play the charachter. Can't wait till act 2 rehersal without scripts!! Rachel

      It's interesting to think about the different power levels and status levels people put themselves and others into with out even thinking about it, and how there are ten thousands different status lines that go off of any one person that have nothing to do with each other. it was fun working with stauts today 'cause one realises exactly what one looked like the first hour of 12th Night.  And those weird skits we did involving staus and objective were hilarious. especially Rachel, sneaking around with the chairs and still being so timid. It's so intimidating play the first poart of her role, because she's so imaginative and can do so many different things. I also loved the idea of verb and into. I really want that book, and ian owes us that chapter copy until we all get it. And we should do the preshow too. rehersal today was awesome-expecially finding the BOXES AND BOXES of those tacky tacky hawaian shirts. Hope we find some cool stuff tomarrow too! Annie

      I enjoyed doing the class/status activities and watching the 2's interact with the 7's, the 9's interact with the 4's, etc.  It was also quite interesting seeing Malvolio as a 7 in the "line-up," just to fall to the very end of the line, even below Antonia.  Even more interesting, was when Ian was talking about the motivation of each line and how we, as human beings have motivation behind everything we say or we wouldn't waste the breath.  When first said, I was skeptical, but oh, how true it is.    On a side note: If you're interested in how some of the major media slants the news and/or have nothing better to do Sunday night, come watch "Outfoxed."  Here's the weblink to get more info on the movie and to sign up to attend.   P.S. there's a conference call with Al Franken afterward.  http://action.moveon.org/outfoxed/   Here's the one I'm going to: Helios  Coffee Company 413 Glenwood Avenue Raleigh, NC 27603 Sunday, July 18, 07:00 PM

       Lessons I've learned today:  A.Reading a Shakespearean monologue is so much better after you've read it throughly enough beforehand to understand what you're saying.  B.It's even better after you figure out the rhythm of the speech C.The best Shakespeare is performed holding one's tongue to eliminate those pesky consonants D. Muses of Light Fixtures can be brought down from the heavens through the prose of Will.(and I don't mean Willy Shakes)

       I loved the press conferences, it was great responding to people as the character, although I've never heard of a press conference that got that personal. The yellow pants are painful on my eyes. Oh and by the way Ian, you've commited your second delving into method-acting. The incoherent mumbling exercise can not help but bring to mind a certain late method actor.

      I had a lot of fun today.  It was so relaxing to lay down and talk to myself and then, switch to Malvolio and create his life story.  To quickly sum it up, Malvolio was the middle child of 3 kids,his mom and dad were partiers and never home, mom was a drunk, and dad didn't pay any attention to him.  The interviews were really funny, too.  I think everyone who got in the "hot seat" did very well.  Today's rehearsal was a blast.  Being Malvolio is so much easier without that pesty script in hand.  Hopefully, I will be able to get through Act I tomorrow without calling line.

      I came late today...everyone was lying on the floor mumbling to themselves. i'll never forget that sight. Once I joined in, I enjoyed answering those questions. It actually didnt feel that odd turning into Toby and makin up a whole life story for him. Rehersal was a blast today. It was a whole lot more fun without scripts, we could actually get really into it. I'm really excited about this show, it's going to be great!!

      I agree with the dukes. Thesis/antithesis is so helpful in reading shakespeare. It is kinda hard for me to spot all of the time, but it is there and it does help SO much. It's just another thing to add into the category of "Why Shakespeare Is A Demi-God".  And Motivation is a huge part of what a character is and knowing every motivation is so toally helpful. I've figured out my motivations for certain lines i was having trouble with and I UNDERSTAND NOW!!  Laying on the floor and talking as the character was so amazingly informative. i had to think up in 1/2 a second what my character would say, and most of the time the answer was out of my mouth before my mind thought it, and then i just went with it. It was so cool. I'd already had a whole, rounded character in my mind and just didn't know it. And Chip was so funny with his interview. Congrads on being so amazingly witty Chip! Annie

      Today I had the most fun with my scene where Antonia is tring to be my lover and hiting on me.  And all I was doing was saying I don't love you it round-a-bout ways.  It really allowed me to exsplore very diffrent sides of the same text.

      I found that the whole thesis and antithesis thing was incredibly handy. It's just one of the many facets of Shakespearean language that is staring you in the face, and you have no idea it's there until someone points it out. Beyond it being just cool and nifty how there are all these conflicting thoughts and stuff, there's that focus in the words that lets you, as the character, know exactly what you're saying and how you're feeling. I LOVE IT! When I teach this stuff, I'm going to make my students recite famous monologues using nothing but the thesis/antithesis words. That is all, good morrow friends.

      Motivation..eheh heh heh. MOTIVATION ah HA HA HA HAHA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAA! WAAAAA HAAAAA HA- okay now that I've got that out. I truly do believe that motivation is the soul of a character. You can really discover things about a character after you figure out what his goal is in the scene. Why does he/she want to do this? What will happen as a result of this action? Does the character believe that he/she will be succesful in this action..Oh I love it! That said, today was awesome. It is extremely difficult to be in control of three people on the stage when they are unified in a common goal and outnumber you, even if you are an 8. On the plus side you get to say really nasty things to them that you would never say as yourself. That's what I like about acting, it gives you a chance to, if only for a moment, live another person's life.

      I have always tried to stop thinking about acting whenever I perform and just react, Meisner seems to be the key for this. I realized today that I am completely lost in my only scene in the play. I can't seem to make Orsino's mood swings and motivations realistic. I am conducting a poll/survey, is there anything that I am doing as Orsino that does not work, or something that should be doing that would. I would really appreciate your answers, and you can answer as honestly as you like. Thanks a lot.

      Today I learned a lot from both guests. I was surprised when the first one told us that Shakespeare was supposed to be fast. I remember Ian telling me to slow down, but I guess that was because you couldnt understand me so going fast just didn't work. It was really interesting to learn more about how Shakespeare put stage directions in his writing.&nbsp;I'm still&nbsp;amazing by how much he puts into it all.  The second guest was so much fun. I loved watching Sam and Erica not acting...i guess thats what youd call it. It was hillarious, especially how it seemed to fit Erica's life story. hahahaha! I didn't really understand how not acting in the beginning can lead to better acting in the end, but I loved watching everyone. Maybe once I try it, I'll get it. If only we had more time. Rehersal today...well I really really need to work on my lines!&nbsp;It was our first day off script in those scenes though, but I so sorry Ian. I had them down pretty well when I went over them, but once I got up there, it was a jumble of words or just blank! I will work on them TONS TONS TONS this weekend. I promise!!

        I liked being a 10, it was nice to know your untouchable baby!      Being a 1 was sad, I couldn't muster up the guts to do anything, not even look at a&nbsp;person. I enjoyed being a 9 and a 8 I felt social and friendly.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   see you tomorrow!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)

        today act 1 and I did a exercise with erin,but I forgot the name of it. It was kind of difficult having to keep your arms up while saying lines. At first I drew a blank but I started to get a hang of it. It was hard to stay focused today,maybe because its Friday.I think&nbsp;we&nbsp;all had some trouble. my memorization is getting better.&nbsp;I dont want to draw blanks onstage, thats not fun at all. chat, chat, chat, FOCUS its fun doing that motion sometimes.  &nbsp;    THATS ALL FOR NOW   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Desteny

        I thought answering iens questions as viola was challenging and funny. It was difficult to make up everything about her parents and her personality. Its been hard for me to find mannerisms for viola. I think her personality is still cloudy for me. Everytime I study I find a little part.It was relaxing laying on the floor but after a while it starts to hurt being on that hard stage. Im excited with act 1,I think me and&nbsp;"olivias"scene is going great!Bethany has those lines down! YOU ARE NOW OUT OF YOUR TEXT,nice attitude girrrrlllllll.ha ha love ya      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desteny  &nbsp;

       hey,   today was cool. I found the two guests very interesting. I learned a lot from them. "what your doing is what your doing" thats true. I will not&nbsp;forget that onstage. if i pretend, the audience sees me pretending.&nbsp;To be belivable you&nbsp;must believe it.Its hard to clear your mind before a scene and just go with it and believe yourself but thats what I try to do.I think everyones doing good and I hope were all off script by monday. I am&nbsp;going to study so I can feel confident in my lines.Thats all of my journal for now,     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desteny   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well I had fun studying the text today R.R. I never knew how movement could be dependent upon the punctuation marks.  And with John G. I learned the importance of acting, which is reACTING like you normally, would in that character's situation.

      Great things ladies and gents!&nbsp; I've been consistently impressed with your work all this week, keep it up.&nbsp; Here's those bits of info I promised I'd post:&nbsp;&nbsp; To reserve seats for the show, leave a message at 919.931.2196 letting me know how many seats and under what name I should put them.&nbsp; I'd love it so much if you could each keep it to five people or less each.&nbsp; I'll definetely make sure the production is videotaped and find a way to get copies to y'all, so if you have a ton of people who want to see it, you can tell them they can see the video instead, how does that sound? &nbsp; And here are My Personal Favourite Plays that you'd asked about: On the Verge, by Eric Overmeyer; Arcadia, by Tom Stoppard; Ring Round the Moon, by Jean Anouilh; Copenhagen, by Michael Frayn; Angels in America, by Tony Kushner; I Am My Own Wife, by Doug Wright; and Kit Marlow, by David Grimm.&nbsp; See you on Monday!&nbsp; Ian

      I learned so much today!!!  and I absolutely loved it.  Our first guest was amazing and so intelligent.  I learned a lot about Shakespeare's text and I really liked how he noted that the only way you can really find the stage directions is by getting the scene off its feet.  I thought he was very interesting and for pushing 50,he was very easy on the eyes, also.  haha. I liked the second guest a lot, too.  I really enjoyed being up there and interacting with Sam.  It was fun "not acting" and playing with the script he gave us.  There were some points when I couldn't stop laughing.  "What you're doing is what you're doing."  That activity and John G, himself, definetly made UNC-G more appealing.  Today also included the best and most relaxing 5 minute break we have had since STC 2004 started.  Well, ya'll have a great weekend!  Buh-bye.

       This past week I've really begun to take on what I want Viola to be when I perform.&nbsp; The gestures are coming easier and the questions that we answered on the floor helped.&nbsp; I really enjoyed learning how to read Shakespeare and decoding how something really is being said.&nbsp; Performing is becoming easier now that I am beginning to get what is being said and in what way.&nbsp; I feel like a flop for not having my monologues down but I've worked on it a whole lot this weekend! Sorry Ian.&nbsp;I enjoyed watching Erica and Sam do the activity where they had to react the way they actually wanted to.&nbsp; That really helped me understand that it shouldn't be so hard because that can look fake and so I understand now how things can be brought to life or toned down.&nbsp; So I'm gonna get back to working on lines and i'll c ya'll tommarow morning :o) -Harleen

       Well I hope you guys had a great time with your monologue workshop because Ian ,Mr. Davis and I were the ones doing the REAL work hauling your precious Catwalk around in Ian's truck. Just kidding, but I hope I didn't too much Monolgue wisdom. The tip about rewarding yourself after auditioning seems so logical now. ( I always look at what I did wrong, or could have done better).

      Hey, sorry I haven't posted in awhile!!&nbsp; Last Friday was fun and I learned a LOT from John &amp; Randy.&nbsp; I really agreed with how John said you have to let acting happen organically and that you can't do too much thinking on it.&nbsp; The exercise that Sam &amp; Erica did was interesting to watch and I think it's a very beneficial exercise in improving acting skills, because it basically forces you not to think and just to be natural.&nbsp; The interpreting Shakespeare text with Randy went very well too I think.&nbsp; It showed me how important it really is to understand the text and familiarize yourself with the meaning of it.&nbsp; Because, if you don't know what the text means, you can't act it (not well at least).&nbsp; I also learned that the text means what it means...and don't read too much into it!&nbsp; It's simple.&nbsp; Today was good too.&nbsp; The play is really coming together, and I love how we've incorporated some really funny things into it (ie. 80's music &amp; some of the costumes, &amp; etc.)&nbsp; It's gonna be great!&nbsp; Keep up the good work everyone!

      today was weird. I felt super unconfident. I felt like I&nbsp;made a lot of mistakes. I learned to always say yes in an audition. Im confused and I am unclear about thesis and antithesis. If anyone can help me please chime in. Im strugglin with this homework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desteny

      The auditions workshop helped me see what I did wrong and right in my own audition for 12th Night.&nbsp; I now see what I can do better but the real test comes later.&nbsp; I don't know what happened today in rehearsal, I had practiced my lines but they all just melted away in my brain today, even some of the ones I am sure I know.&nbsp; It dont' feel like nerves either, until the thoughts melt in my brain ofcourse.&nbsp; I have to admit I'm a better audio learner and I just sat there reading the script to myself this weekend and I prolly needa find someone to recite stuff with me. So I'm gon get my people to help me at the radio station tonite since I'm gon be there till 1. Make sure ya'll check me out on WXDU 88.7 from 10pm-1am.&nbsp;

       Well, in case you're wondering Ian, we decided that in during scene breaks that each person sitting at the table would have one line that they say during a scene break and then assume a different pose than the previous one for the next scene. I'll bet you're really confused right now.  Here's an example. You say your line "Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers." Now a person at your table might say "I feel really, really bad about this." Then that same person might decide to slump forward instead of their previous position of being upright. The next scene break( Ian told us that you can usually tell the end of scenes by the rhyming couplets. That person would say " I feel really really bad about this." And then sit looking at the ceiling with crossed arms for the next scene. That's the best I can do, as far as explaining is concerned.

      I've been forgetting to post, so sorry about that.&nbsp; I don't know what was up with me today.&nbsp; I just didn't feel too energetic and I was super tired.&nbsp; I think some of what was bothering me was that I knew more of Erica was coming into my character each time we performed and I didn't really know how to fix it.&nbsp; I'm glad we worked on my posture/stance today.&nbsp; The tightening of the shoulders is a little painful, but I think it's going to help my character a lot and I'm going to concentrate really hard on keeping that same stance consistent through the play.&nbsp; And hopefully, by the end of the performance, I'll have buns of steel!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I'm getting excited about the performance.&nbsp; I think it's going to be great and I can't wait to show it to people.&nbsp; Welp, I'm off to practice the letter scene with my stiff shoulders and all, so I can hopefully fix what was wrong today and get a good night's sleep so I'll be bright and chirpy for the morning.&nbsp; Everyone's doing a superb job!

      YES! My computer is saved! it has returned to me! Sorry I haven't posted all week, but viruses had my computer beaten for a while. but it's useable now. I loved working on audtioning. It's such a scary and intimidating thing to do anyway, and when you're unsure of whats going to happen or how you could do better, you tend to run as fast as you can in the other direction, and just not audition.&nbsp; Everything Ian said was so helpful. Knowing how to do your resume and what to say to the casting director and what not to do is such a relief. Thanks Ian. All the excerises we did on Tuesday and Wednsday really reinforced the idea of connection and chape of the character. And I really needed the focus exercise. It's really hard to keep a position for me, especially when sitting down, cause&nbsp;I get this urge to get up and wander around in a trance. I really have to focus on something not to do it.&nbsp; And all of our runs throughs have been awesome. Everyone's been doing an awesome job at keeping character (and doing tech work). This show has been so much fun! The cave man excerise rocked! I'm not really sure why. I just went with my gut and worked with my friends in this imaginary world of prehistoric times. And it was fantastic!If we could do it again if we have time tomarrow, that would rock. (I loved the story about shoes, that seems like a great idea.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Our run throughs today went really well and thank you Ian and Chip for being so great and going out and getting the chairs and then fooling us into thinking that we only had eight.&nbsp;Y'all rock. Tomarrow is our last day. Which sucks. So we'd better make the best of it.&nbsp; my wish is that we go all out and not worry about the show. I just want everyone to have a good time playing around within their character. Cause that's what theaters all about.

      Hey! I've been so busy I haven't gotten the chance to write anything, so today I'll talk about everything from the past week! I've had a blast running through the show. I think everyone is doing awesome, I'm so excited about our show tomorrow! I can't believe we've been in STC for 3 weeks already!!  Well I finally got all my lines and blocking down this past week! yea! It feels great to go through it smoothly, but then I make these little mistakes, but I've only gotten one note from Ian. I guess that means I'm doing alright, but I know I did mess up in some places. Perhaps you thought I already knew? I really feel like I've improved a lot. I took Ian's notes to the whole cast about having more energy and making everything bigger. It's so much fun, especially when I don't have to think about my lines! But then I have left off some words before or said REDEMY instead of REMEDY, anyone notice besides Andrew and Maria? I liked working on physicality yesterday, it helped a lot once I remembered today. Even though I didn't go on stage to work on connecting, I thought it was fun to watch. I have much more to say but I have to go. I'll post more up later. Oh, do we still need to work on the fight scene?? I thought Ian had said we did but we never did. Rachel

      I would like every single member of STC, especially Ian and Erin, to know that these past three weeks have been beyond anything I could have wished for out of a summer theater program, and that I respect and love every single one of you. This cast could not have been picked any better, and I thank you all for the blessing you have put in my life.&nbsp; I've got such great memories of you guys and I hope you have those same fond memories of me (I HOPE!!)&nbsp; I'm going to miss you all so much, especially Tequila Time with Erin, movie talks with Jordan during lunch, talking with Sam, huggin Will and watching him halfheartedly make a show of hating all the attention he was getting, Spidey busting out in dance moves randomly on stage, Chip and his muscials and mass knowledge of plays, Ivy and her yellow pants, Sasha and her sense of wicked sense of humor, Haley being revolted everytime&nbsp;I drunkenly wrapped my arm around her neck, Destiny gazing lovely at ian as he ranted on about his heart, Erica swingin' her hips around, Bethany and her french accent, being the other half of Racheal, Ian's enthusiasm and tolarance of all of us, as well as his amazing teaching ability (as well as the&nbsp;look on his face when he walked in  JUST  at the wrong time in a conversation), and giving y'all massages! If anybody wants an audition buddy or has any sort of show going up, post it here, and I'll come to thee!&nbsp; Let's keep this blog going baby!&nbsp; Who ever has everyone's information needs to post it so we can all keep in touch. Thanks everyone! Annie

      I just wanted to say that it has my my honor and my privilege to work with all of you. Were I the crying type, I would have broken into sobs at the end of the show, but instead I was just forlorn for the rest of the night. This play was, by far, my favorite thus far. I will miss Ian's odd little phrases and moments of severe twitching and waving of the arms when he gets excited about something, I'll miss Sasha's (forgive misspellings) bold and down-right dirty humor, I'll miss Ivy's legs in yellow stockings and cross gartered dancing to "We like to Party", I'll miss Will's sexy man booty, annie's backrubs, this list could go on all night. What I encourage all of you to do is to come back next year, and then we can get even better. I'm aged out, but i'm going to do my best to be there to help; if anything, i'll be there for the performance. I would love to keep in touch with you guys, i think you're the coolest bunch around. So, as a gesture of good faith, assuming none of you are stalkers in your alternate life, here are ways to contact me:  urlLink email-Noscapekaos@aol.com , AIM-Noscapekaos (you'll have to send me an e-mail first, because i've got this weird thing that blocks people unless they're on my list), and my phone number-919-556-5068. I hope i'm not the only one who wants to stay up with you guys, it would be handy if we could get those names and numbers of folks who aren't in the blog too, cuz they rocked too. Anywho, i'm late for work. I'll check the posts, see you guys later (i hope)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Ian Wolf

      Just wanted to say one last set of good lucks, goodbyes, farewells.&nbsp; I had a marvelous time working with you all these past three weeks and I hope that our paths cross ways again in the future.&nbsp; It's been wonderful to be part of such a positive, fun, and talented group.&nbsp; You all did so well on Friday and I think we can say with confidence that our  Twelfth Night  was truly an ensemble production.&nbsp; Please stay in touch if at all possible -- I'd love to know where you all decide to go to college / high school!&nbsp; As for me, I'll be in England starting September 21st and I promise a postcard to anyone who sends me their address.&nbsp; My email is  urlLink erinsullivan@gmail.com  and I just might be creating my own blog once I make my way across the pond... I'll keep you all posted!   All the best,   Erin

      I had so much fun on Friday night.&nbsp; I think we all did very well and had a lot of fun while doing it.&nbsp; These past 3 weeks were great.&nbsp; Unlike school, I looked forward to what I would be doing that day and what I would be learning.&nbsp; I learned more in 3 weeks than I have in 3 years and I have everyone that I have met in this experience to thank for it.&nbsp; Thanks Ian and Erin.&nbsp; You guys are great!&nbsp; I respect you both so much, not just as directors and Shakespearian translators, but as people, also.&nbsp; You're awesome and you're positivity and excitement about life is contagious.&nbsp; I'm drama club president and if either of you are ever willing, it'd be awesome if you could conduct a workshop or something at our school or just stop by and say, 'hey!'&nbsp; As for everybody in the ensemble, I love you guys.&nbsp; Each of you are so eccentric and talented and I would love it if I kept in touch with all of ya.&nbsp; My email is  urlLink luckieducky13@aol.com &nbsp;and my phone is (919) 931-6339.&nbsp; I agree with everyone who said that we should all post future productions that we are in.&nbsp; I'm vowing right now that I will come to anyone's show if I am able.&nbsp; Good luck in all your future endeavors!&nbsp; Keep in touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      That was the fastest 3 weeks I have ever had. I remember the last camp I went to for 3 days seemed like 3 years and STC seemed like 3 days!! I had an awesome time. I have never learned sooo much about theatre-auditioning, voice projection, improv, charachter work, colleges and pro acting, Shakespeare's writing, and all those crazy activities we did like the caveman!! This was the best play I've ever been in. I think we all did a super job! My family loved it and was very impressed. (oh, by the way. 2 of my guests got there a little late and there were no seats left and one couldn't stand because she just had surgery on her foot so they didn't get to see it. I'm disapointed because i reserved 5 seats and only got 3. What's up with that?) Anyways, The cast was great. Everyone is so talented and crazy fun. I hope to see you all again in other shows or even better work in a show together!! Ian and Erin, you all were super! I had a blast learned from you guys. If only i could get those tongue twister things. I hope to work with you again. Everyone has to keep in touch with me. email: Rach333a@aol.com and my screename: TWIZZZLERZZZ. I love you all and will miss you.

      I just got a flier in the mail for the North Carolina Shakespeare Festival. Not only is it this nifty hologram thingie that switches from a drawing of Shakespeare's head to a proffessional portrait of his whole body (sorry, simple mind, simple pleasures), but the plays they are doing this year are Othello and (cue the dramatic music) Twelfth Night. If anybody cares about this stuff, just add a post and i'll post it. Right now, i gotta go to work. Catch yall later.
