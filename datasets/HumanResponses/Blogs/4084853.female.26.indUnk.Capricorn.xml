      It's a friday.... it's raining and it's dreary... all i am thinking about is that there is a few more minutes to clock out. i have been wondering lately how different my life has been since i left legal practice 8 months ago (8 month's ago???? OMG - has it really been that long??). do i miss it? yes.... and no... i miss : being able to have access to loads of legal journals and statues, instant advise a few steps down the corridor, tapping into other lawyer's precedents and improvising on them, being 10 minutes away from home, being able to do my hair during friday lunches, dropping by KLCC for lunchtime shopping, being able to identify myself as a practising lawyer... i DON'T miss: the stressful hours in practise, certain people (who shall remain nameless), the dark shadows under my eyes at the end of the week, trying to juggle, the copious amount of work and studying at the same time, being cooped up between four walls with the constant phone ringing as the background music to one's work... oh well, you can't have eveything in life can you? but i don't regret leaving legal practice. well, as a legal-cum-secretarial exec at an MNC subsidiary, i have more fun at work. THAT'S IT!!!! I did not have fun as a practicing lawyer. and now i do. credit must be given to four girlfriends of mine who withstood my endless stressed out periods, rantings and ravings... oh... time to leave. friday does not look so dreary after all!!!!

      At last night's Function, I bumped into many of my fellow Function go-ers (most of whom own blogs which I read daily). To my surprise, one of them found out about my attempts at weaving tales of yours truly and her incidental issues. Heh heh... Thanks Sharizal. Your advice and comments are very much appreciated.  After the Function, I rushed out to meet Other Half who had just finished class. At the Function, quite a lot of people asked me where Other Half was (in fact, an acquaintance thought one of the fellow diners sharing my table ws actualy him!). Honestly, it is getting quite tiring being asked the same question time and time again. Other Half, although a member of the group which organises these Functions, is a silent member (mind you,  silent  being the operative word). His attendance can be counted with the fingers of ONE hand (as opposed to me), despite the fact that we actually met at one of these Functions. His reason? He is of the opinion that the time spent socialising can be better utilised on other things.  Which got me thinking. Is it really a waste of time?  The answer is..... je ne sais pas . I honestly don't know. To me, these Functions provide me with a couple of things. 1. Knowledge - I act as an osmosis sponge, absorbing all information around me, be it general knowledge, capital market information or just plain old gossip. I come out of these events somewhat wiser ( oh really, Izreen..., you know you attend for the pure exhiliration of listening to your friends and acquaintances dishing out the latest goss ). But seriously, I do store some info in this bimbo-istic brain of mine. How else can I keep up with Other Half? Me, I am no brainiac, 2. Social skills - I am able to brush up on my social skills, making friends  et al . How else can you learn how to be diplomatic while dealing with person(s) who you are slightly averse to? 3. Fine dining - altough, ironically, a prevalent topic at the dinner table last night was (  shock! horror!  ) on diets and healthy eating. But heck, when else do you get to taste the typical dishes of many different countries? 4. People watching - I get a kick out of this. Inevitably, I get good goss from those around me. The Gals claim that these events provide me with the oppourtunity to sharpen my tongue and claws ( meowrrrrr!! ). But dahlings...... I exist to Exist! 5. Launching platform into high society - hey, all those young upstarts have got a foothold into Society. How else can you capitalise on future connections?  So, in all honesty, I don't think my attendance at these Functions is a total waste of time. In fact, I shall continue attending them - upon prior notification to Other Half of course, who oh so  casually  reminded me about it last night.  Sigh.... you can never win in some situations.

      A wee bit of a slow day today.... Not that I don’t have work (I DO!!! I have got a rather tall pile of documents, files and papers scattered across my limited cubicle space). But just that I am bored. I know.. It contradicts my earlier blog that I love my job. It’s just that it is one of those days. Sigh....  There is a Function tonite which I will be attending with a couple of my girlfriends. I love these Functions. A lot of my friends have accused me of being the  tai-tai  amongst them. contrary to their claims, I don’t think I can be a  tai-tai . I LIKE work - of sorts. I love the law, but I am a people person too. So I think I am in the right company at present. But who knows what the future brings, right...? ( cue elevator music : i’m dreaming of.... hehe. wink wink! )  I think I have got my head wa-a-a-a-ay up in the sky at the moment. Am currently in a  bimbo  mood. (but then again, I think I have always been a  bimbo  at heart. The trick is to trick people into thinking that one is smart.)  Went to the BC yesterday and checked out two books - one on the English Heritage and another ws a chick lit thingy. I think I would love to live in the UK - hence the mood to read about the UK (dear God... I hope you are listening to my prayer. Please let me (us?) settle down in the UK). The chick lit thingy was an acknowledgement of my  bimbo-istic  nature.  Right... back to work. Those statutory financial accounts are calling to me..... I have 5 companies to go and they are all a bit of a drag. No way... Make that  A LOT !

      there is just not enough hours in the day for me.... so many things to do, so little time to finish it in. in the next week, there are meetings to attend, papers to prepare, classes to sleep in (??) and on top of that Events to look forward to.  i foresee the next one year to be a roller coaster ride. one which i am looking forward to.  by the by, my trip to cherating was rather interesting. it was nice to see old acquaintances (notice that i did not mention friends? although there were a few people who did qualify as friends) it is amazing to note that even 10 years on, old animosities die hard. and indifferences live on. and people are still judged on appearances. a load of bollocks if you ask me. oh well... superficiality lives on. whatever it is, i believe that you should not pre-judge a person and let such judgments live on wa-a-a-ay into the future.  Sis, by the way, has been banished to the depths of a Northern oil-rich state for the next 2 months. err.... have fun Sis. when you get back, i shall take you out for sushi and what not. it's kinda lonely in our side of the house.  Other Half is a certified scatterbrain - rabbits do not take a violent liking to cute, little shiny objects.  another long day today..... but i aim to have fun. i like my job.

      i am so-o-o-o bogged down with work. for some odd reason, fridays are the busiest day of the week for lawyers.  why?  it does not help matters that Sis got another promotion in her firm. i am being left deperately behind.  is it me or are lawyers the world over seriously underpaid and overworked?  cherating.... i hope you can relieve me of the misery of a friday.

      i swear to god.  the other sex will drive me crazy. that is, if i am not crazy enough to begin with. why is it that men are oblivious to a woman's doing? can someone please answer me on this? and they never listen. to all you men out there, i know you hate it when women nag or scold, but there is a reason to it. if you listen, we do not have to repeat ourselves....  sigh   last night, Other Half committed what i call a relationship sin. like hello? there was a reason i was hovering around when you bumped into your old acquaintance. i think at this point of time, you should know that i   LIKE   meeting new people. and by this time, you jolly well ought to realize that i am quite liable to turn into a shrew should i not agree with what you do. so, i must say that you handled last night rather well.  oh, and dear.... go and ask your mother the long list of things you ask me last night. i am not the walking social and ettiquette encyclopaedia at your service.

      here i am... still sitting at my cubicle at this hour of the evening. and what am i doing? trying to clear all outstanding files of the top of my limited cubicle space. the printer is acting up again. stooopid dum dum!!  tomorrow i shall be spending the day at seremban high court. wowwee... yippidee. the last time i went, i was bored witless. K claims that i am not born to be a litigator - i do not have the patience to wait patiently for my cases to be called up. besides, it's a well known fact between my Gal-Pals that  em> Miss Bimbo    here nearly got kicked out of chambers in the high court during her chambie days... like, hello....? it was not my fault that the file was screwed up, his royal highness the TP-of-the-day was having a bad hair day (and PMS to boot?) and i was merely being my    bimbo-istic    self (?). Everytime i bring that incident up, N will just give me a look filled with despair. of course, we all are not passionate about litigation work as she is. now, must remind myself to bring books...  the reunion is looming closer. i foresee myself queening on a beach, fully lathered in sunscreen under the Company's golf umbrella. ha ha ha.... must remind the committee to book a place for dinner with astro facilities - wouldn't want to miss the AF weekly concert. must i paste on a fake smile for all those people? i bet you there will be evil tongues wagging around. however, reunions are a place to shock others and i bet you Z and me are going to spring quite a few on those straight laced persons.  Other Half, by the way, is still in office. don't we make a pair? will be meeting up with him later on for supper... so i better get all this junk of my table first. now, where did i put those agreements?

      yesterday, to my shock and horror, i found out that i passed the PTD exam!! for those who are not familiar with it, the PTD exam is the entrance test for individuals who wish to work in the government sector.  i hear laughter from my friends in the background.......  yes, little miss social butterfly passed her PTD exam on her first take when she did not put an iota of effort in preparing for it. this is amazing considering how a LOT of people actually STUDY for the 5 papers. moi? i made up my mind to actually sit for it at 11.30 a.m., drove my friends crazy by asking for directions to the exam centre and for tips, and decided that i couldn't be bothered to stress myself about it. my only preparation for it was to buy a copy of the star newspaper and digest whatever information there was in it. of course, i ended up reading the gossip columns, horoscope and comic strips....sigh.... the exam itself was not easy. i actually cracked my brain over the mathematical and logic questions - thereby assuring myself that i have no logic whatsoever in this brain of mine. with crappy   bahasa melayu  , i struggled to write the   bahasa melayu   essay - but it did help that the question was on international sports. so there i was, penning away about formula one to my hearts delight. the english essay was finished in 25 minutes flat - i just couldn't be bothered to write 4/5 pages when we were required to write only 300 words.  so i passed... and i have decided that i don't think i will be joining the civil service. the reason? i love my present job too much. i still love reading the law and get a kick from drafting agreements. oh, and the fact that i get to give instructions to legal firms is a big TURN ON (deep inside me, i have this hope of rejecting certain firms as the Company's lawyers... muahahahahahahaha!!!).  why did i apply for it in the first place? at that time, it was the only way out from the downward, manic depressive cycle i was in at that time. all i can think about was getting out (to the point that i felt like turning the steering wheel to the side of the highway at 120 km/h. i thank god my faith was still with me at that time... masyallah....  a friend of mine, let's call her Phish, says that i would probably destroy the government civil service should i decide to join it. gee... thanks gurl, for the faith you have in my proposals of government reforms.  maybe, in the future.... i may decide to apply again to serve the government. my time has yet to come.... and when it does, God help Malaysia.

      the office is freaking freezing... and my mind is not on work. not surprising, since i'll be spending the weekend in cherating with a bunch of school friends for our 10 year college reunion. speaking of which, this would be one of the last events i will actually volunteer to organise for any body of persons whatsoever. it is not worth it. and me, a very impatient person.. sigh....  back to the proposed holiday weekend, the plan was for me to drive up with a guy-friend of mine of friday night and spend the night at my cousin's. last night though, Mum announced that the House will be hosting a doa selamat for my late Grandmother . okay... she let me go to cherating though, which was pretty sporting of her. then, all of a sudden, i had a phone call informing me that there was an important UMNO meeting i had to attend on the friday night. yikes!!! all of a sudden, something dawned on me. things happen for a reason. the fact that there are two separate incidents which are preventing me from going to cherating on friday night must be there for a reason.  so, i have made up my mind.  i will be following me ex-roommate and another classmate in a separate car and we three will drive to cherating on saturday morning.  i don't think i want to tempt fate. for some reason, i have an instictive feeling for these sort of things. plus the fact that my cousin would most probably be in KL that night would be a contributory factor as well. UMNO meeting will be held in nikko hotel (  wah  .... got that much money   one ah  ?)  i mentioned about the upcoming cherating trip to Other Half. his response?  okay... go lah. . right... how very enthusiastic and supportive. oh well, what can i expect from an auditor? i am just grateful that he let's me lead my own life. as opposed to him, i am the   bimbo-istic   social butterfly. which reminds me.... must reply to the next few wedding invites asap.....

      i so love weddings.... call me romantic, but i think that weddings are events at which a person is allowed to dream and fantasise at (or about). There are especially happy occasions (i have yet to attend a wedding that was a downright miserable, unhappy occasion) and a place where you will meet unexpected people. although i must admit, at times, weddings can be a bit of a drain on the pocket. oh well... cést la vie! i am so-o-o booked for weddings for the next few weekends (everybody seems to want to get married in august - oh, it must be the school holidays season!)  last weekend, i dragged my Other Half to a wedding of an old school friend of mine. Incidentally, the Parents (my society loving Mum and me Dad) were also invited to the same wedding. being me, i decided that it was best if we went separately (and how right i was!). by the end of the wedding, i had come to a conclusion that it was one of the best weddings i had ever been to. admittedly, it was not a grand, pompous, spend-it-all on one night event, but it was just a HAPPY, JOYFUL occasion! the bride and groom were just happy to get married, and she had a brilliant smile pasted on her the whole night, not one of those i-am-so-self-conscious-and-nerved-tonight smiles. she invited few tables of her close friends from school and work (he, being a gwailo, had a few close friends at hand). all tables had reminders of the places they had visited together during their courtship. the slideshow had a few embarrassing pictures from years gone by. by the end of the night, it was obvious that the wedding had turned into a big reunion event for all the friends the happy couple invited.  Other Half commented that he found it unbelieveable that girls at three tables can chatter non-stop through dinner and eat at the same time. this is exactly the reason why i cannot bring him to too many functions - i'm afraid that he will find it a bit of a bore. you see, he relishes on important things such as capital markets and investments - although there are times when he surprises me. he has a tendency to observe, rather than participate. but it got too much by the end of the night as the six girls at my table were literally hopping from one topic to another like fleas. Other Half just blanked out. oh god... there are other weddings which i have to bring him along. but i love him for having to suffer through it without nary a complaint....  We girls stayed behind at the end of the wedding to take photos and hug each other endlessly. you see, some of us had not set eyes on each other since we left school 10 years ago! the husbands (and Other Half) were sidelined... much to the girls delight. they were just ignored... oh well!  The Parents commented that it was not quite done of the couple to smile so brilliantly at the wedding. Uh, Ma and Dy,I WANT a wedding like that. I would love to have a wedding that i can be myself at, have all my close friends celebrate it together with me (and of course, invite certain people out of spite... no lah! i don't think i shall stoop to a level that low. besides, it's EXPENSIVE to invite unwanted people.) i don't think i want a very formal wedding, full of protocol...  sigh.. i wonder when that time will come. everybody was asking about such time and i have been giving the same answer over and over again.... oh well, when the time come, then people will now.  at the moment, i can only dream of having a diamond solitaires (or a few) on my hand.
