      hie hie to all eh... hahaz btw zhenhua here... hmmm...new to dis bloggin ding though i tnk it is a bit of a waste of time...hhaaz/ nvm... gow ith the flow man! hahaz tomorrow the 18th of july is the 22nd student council invistiture... realli wonderin how it would go...  btw.. hahaz proud to annouse dat i m da secondary two coordinator of the 22nd student council.. reallie kool... one post dat i m glad i received... since the start of my student council life... no one reallie tot dat i would become a coordinator(coord.). mainly because a coord. job is to love and guide... one of da many things ppl tot i could'nt do... but u bet i m gona prove pple wrong... i was said to be insensitive and not sympertatic enof... but... dats whu i am... any way i m proud dat i changed... ppl should start to look at others in another view  i m a sec2 coord. now... and i will do a good job, no question asked, to prove to "the rest" dat i m worth my post...and dat no one else would be&nbsp;a better coord. den i am going to be.  i m a believer...   but i do nt jus believe... i work hard for it...&nbsp;to all 22nd sc pple out dare.... watch out... zhenhua is coming up... hahaz...  ppl always said dat "post dont matter"... but something in deir heart always wanted a higher post.... wanted something more, izzen't dis human... how real... but no matter wad... 22nd must sticj together... have you forgotten all da pains we been tru to gt here... i dun think u can ever 4gt... it must be in ya heart... somewhere. for dose whu are thinking of letting go... dont....   BeLiEvE   and u can work wonder... dun 4gt all da sweat and hard work we all been tru... dis is one bond dat we should never break.   ppl might be unhappy with how da posting went... think bout dis... do u noe as much as da teachers know... are u wiser den dem...?Â¿... i think not... so da teachers surly had reasons 4 doin wad dey did... postings are nt a test of capability, but more of a "format" teachers have to follow to make a "better" batch... one capable guy may nt be able to handle stress... if dats da case how can u give him high responsibility?  now about ncc... yeah we are also takin over soon... don worry too much... let dings flow... yesh i want a good post n i fear dat da fact dat i m a councillor may weight me down... but i will neber give up one of my cca 4 da other... it is nt fair.... so ppl in ncc readin dis.... dun worry...   believe    &nbsp;   in tis world dare is a nid, 4 pple to lead da rest to rise above the "average" life, by giving off deir best tis is ur dae a world to win accept the chellenge of your goals and in yourself:     BELIEVE    >>

      something is bordering me... it is well... something.  i have been trying to get that done for a long long long long long long time le... but i just cant get down to it... not that i wanna push the fault but pple are also dragging.  i just cant get down to it.... other things are more interesting to me now. also, i have taken over lao... gt quite a lot of things to do... my job is everyday... thus well i m filled everyday, but no worry i luv wad i am doing... but i love this job too much that maybe i m putting down the other important part in my schooling life... i dont want this to happen... but i just cant click with some of the pple inside. maybe i m expecting too much from them. :( sad :(  another thing... well... i cant concentrate in my studies too, of coz i wanna do well, whu dun wanna.but i reallie need to learn how to sit down and read n study. when i study... i cant even last for more then 30 minutes... whats wrong with me,  was thinking... one pple in da sec2s lost something important. some of them also lost something even more important. the guy whu lost wad he did in da scrm was sad... but what he did not know is dat i m even more heartbroken... did he didi that bcoz i dint do my job well? if i were to punish him... n i supposed to punish myself 1st?  some of da ppl also lost a v.impt thing... committment.. hope dose pple will see dis n rmb the commitment they put in when dey just entered... where's the will to excel..... wheres the want to be THE BEST  always ready ever willing

      Farewell party just ended... but i don feel sad at all.... it felt happie....  tis is our 2nd project since 22nd Sc became office bearers... but to be trueful... is wasent really a job well done. i cant sae dat it is nt gd, 4 da simple fact dat i can nv know if i can do better den dem. but i think tis is far from our best. it was so last minute... things kept changing and problems were nt well thought out. i cant sae dat it is welfare's fault, but it is more of a 22ndsc's fault. lets work together n make sure dis dun happen again eh  Well... to the secondary 4 councillors, thank you 4 everything. yr effort in teaching us wadeva u know. the caring heart u devoted to us, the lessons u guys taught in camps, in events and as a friend will stay with us till ever n ever. sorry 4 all da mistakes we've made, sorry 4 da sad sad nights we made u guys wonder if we are going to survive... lets me tell all this... we will survive, we will nt only survive, we will excel and be da best in JSS. it is nt all sae n no do, it is more of a trust we have in each other and in each committee dat we CAN do it. WE CAN  So 22nd sc, strive... dun stop here. never stop in fact... continue to break limits and show to da WORLD dat... 226's da best  SmiLes ZhenHua
