      "mocking the world as it beats our ass."  Josh and I are walking home from a perfectly splendid evening. In front of us are some boisterous boys talking about their evening's exploits, and one of them comes out with "she totally wanted to give you a blow job." Josh, walking only a few feet back, answers as only Josh can, "no she didn't."  They were decent sized guys, not big, but bigger than Josh and I, and there were four of them. Luckily, only the one behind looked back to see us snickering, and I don't think he heard what Josh had said.

       urlLink This  is by far one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time. I suppose that only Josh will care, but I just found a ton of bloggers that live in my neighborhood. One of them linked to  urlLink pictures from a target opening  that happened in my neighborhood. I'm pretty sure that's Lizzy Grubman there, but can anyone recognize some of the others?  Is there anything similar for Boston or TN?

      Two movies that caught my eye recently, neither of which is probably safe for work.  urlLink The first  is about the difference between the internet and real life, and  urlLink the second  is about the Republicans coming to New York.

      Fox is running 2 hours of Family Guy in prime time Wednesday night. This means something is coming. Or it's just competition for the Olympics. Well, that was a quick emotional roller coaster.

      I don't know if anyone else used to play games on an old Apple IIE or IIGS, but  urlLink Peasant's Quest  really took me back.  In case you guys don't know the background, this was made by the guys who created  urlLink Homestar Runner  and are responsible for weekly  urlLink Strong Bad E-mails  which are pretty entertaining.

      Do you realize that you all left a full, unopened box of Nerds here?  This is the best thing that's happened to me all summer.

      and she's bringing him to New York.  I mentioned that she was visiting in a comment below, but forgot to include the boy. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, my new place is a studio with one queen sized bed, one couch, a little bit of space on the floor and that's pretty much it in terms of sleeping space.  Me. Julie. Ansel.  There really is a lot to be said, but I think I'll leave it alone.

      so i got into a car accident last night.  just saw harold and kumar with tina and bhaumik and we were on our way back from the theater around midnight when the fool in front of me decided that upon seeing the light change from *green to yellow* (not yellow to red, mind you), he would slam on his brakes despite the fact that we was **already in the middle of the intersection**.  of course, having seen the yellow light and having realized that i was definitely within range of making it through before it turned red, i kept going at full speed.  didn't quite have enough time to come to a halt after i slammed on my own brakes.  luckily we were all fine--wearing seatbelts, airbags deployed, etc. (have you ever smelled airbags?  it's awful and i'm pretty sure i'm going to die of lung cancer from all that crap in inhaled).  anyway, we were ok, but the front end of my car isn't looking so good.  thank god i have insurance.  anyway, i hate driving in this city.  to end on a less serious note--i have a crapload of essays that i need to edit for my job so i decided to stay in tonight and do that.  what have i done all day since tina and bhaumik left for home?  read that damned blog!!  thanks for helping me out srinivas--i had, of course, already read all the comics because i'm obsessed with this site.  what will i do when i finally get caught up?  oh yeah--all the stuff i'm supposed to be doing instead.  4 days to go until school starts...

      I'm pretty sure the blogspot ads at the top of your blogspot blog is supposed to be tailored to the content of your blog in some fashion.  What does it say about us that the ad I'm currently looking at (in another window, of course) says, "Help us cure  urlLink Crohn's  and  urlLink Ulcerative Colitis .  Learn about these diseases."  Maybe Coco had ulcerative colitis.  Maybe they know about UHS's incorrect diagnosis of my chronic appendicitis as a possible ulcer.  But it's probably just Josh's crazy med school talk.

      I counted four gray hairs in the mirror just now.  Must be aging and not stress since I don't feel very stressed right now.  But maybe they sprouted during spring finals, and I'm just noticing them.   Going gray isn't so bad.  It's distinguished.  Last month, a cab driver told me I look 18 or 19.  Maybe if I had gray hair, he would've treated me with the respect I deserve.

      ok, so it's like 5 am.  i am *still* reading this girl's blog ( urlLink http://theunderweardrawer.homestead.com ).  in the 4th year now.  late 2002.  just gotta get to 2003 and then i'll sleep.  i swear.  thought i would share this funny little story:  "All of a sudden, I woke up out of sleep with a start.  Some noise, or some subtle motion in my body, had set me awake.  I wasn't quite sure what it was.  In a semi-stuporous daze, I tried to figure out what it had been.  And then I realized. I had farted.  I had farted, and the sound combined with the vibration had shaken me awake.  I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF GRAND ROUNDS AND FARTED MYSELF AWAKE IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT.  Now let us never speak of this again."  ha!  oh that michelle...what will she do next??

      Hey Sal,  We're going to start calling you Coco the Wonder Monkey from now on, 'k? The relevant Seinfeld episode popped into my head for some reason, and the phrase just sort of came together. I realized I had to assign it to someone, and if not you, then who? If you think about it, it's sort of a compliment. You know, "Wonder," etc., and who doesn't love a monkey, am I right?   In the interest of fairness, I'll let you decide how you want "Wonder" and "Monkey" spelled. "Coco" is non-negotiable.   Peace out, Coco.

      If you're looking for something besides the  urlLink official kerry gear,  I'm going to link to the two best Kerry shirt sites that I've found:  urlLink one  and  urlLink two.  There are plenty of others, but these were my favorites.  I'm planning on getting one or two if I can afford it when I get paid.

      This is an open letter asking that you please accept my sincerest invitation to become a member of the blog that I started called QuincyB21 (reference  urlLink here ) . Shankar and Srinivas have already accepted my invitation and summarily been made administrative users. We humbly request your presence and await your reply.  Faithfully yours, Sal  p.s. You know we're going to talk about you, right? I mean, come defend yourself, man.

      So after a weekend of very college-like activities, I decided to actually start the blog that we mentioned in passing. I'm positive that Shankar and Srinivas know more about this than I, so let me know if we'd like to get a different site, change the look, etc.  I imagine we'll delete this first post, but let me know what you guys think.  Also, how do we get rid of the blogspot link at the top? Do you guys get a link button on your page (I think that's a problem with macs)?
