       Well last night whit spent the night..and this  morning my little cousin who i babysit came and i am watching her.  She informed me that last night at the fair her mother said that if i didnt pay attention to her in public places i wouldnt be able to watch her anymore. Well i am pretty sure that i went with my friends purposely so that i could hang out with them and not babysit.But when my aunt saw me she said hey i knew where i found boys i would find you guys..referring to me and whitney. Then she said "well you have on more clothes than i expected" totally rude! in front of all my friends...that sucked real bad!  That is the main reason i didnt ride up with my aunt is because i wanted to meet my friends there and not  babysit...not that i dont love my lil cousin to death its just sometimes i like to hang out with my friends and just have to worry about myself ya know? i dunno i am not really mad i think that it is jsut that my feelings were hurt...i mean i was planning on riding a few rides with sammi jo but we rode round up and then went to watch the derby...after the derby we rode round up again  and then the people we went with wanted to leave..which in the end turned out to be a good thing because we sit in traffic for like anb hour and a half and didnt make it home until like midnight...well i think me and sammi are going to go chill by the pool after we straighten up the house....<33 love always..ash x0x0x

       hey hey so this  is my first entry... my name is ashley nichole taylor  and i live in Charleston, Wv... i am 15 yrs old and i am a sophomore at Sissonville High School.   I am currently single but i am still madly in love with my jerky ex-boyfriend... but tonight i went to the Putnam County fair with my best friend BerWhi and had a great time with Sam, Matt, Pook, and Cody. SOme of my ex's friends...he was supposed to call me when he arrived at the fair but " he didnt have his cell" so unfortunately i didnt get to spend time with him.. he was there the entire time and didnt even get in touch with me so i mean i am kinda getting the clue that he isnt interested.  I had a really great  time with his old best freind Matt, but he has a girlfriend and i wouldnt want to mess something like that up they have been dating for like 8 months...anyways i am really confused in the whole guys situation.  Although i am playin a good match maker... i hooked whitney and sam up tonite. They are talkin on the fone...well i guess that is enough for right now i am sure that i will write again soon...<3 always, ash x0x0x
