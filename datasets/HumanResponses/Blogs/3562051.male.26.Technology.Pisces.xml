      sometimes your damned if you do and damned if you dont..... dont you hate when that shit happens.  one thing that i hate is being the bitch.... today i got yelled at by someone but i acted very professionally i must say :) and made them look like the fool, but the thing was that i got yelled at not because i did anything just because this person felt like they could cause im the bitch and they could get away with it vent and their would be no consequences. they thought i would cower but i didnt and i put them in their place without getting excited without yelling. i was pretty proud of myself. :)  but the thing that bothers me is that being the bitch sucks in the owrk place and it doesnt seem like it will ever change unless they get some other schelp out a college who knew nothing.

      the other day i tired to enter a new post and wrote alot but as usual something went wrong and i fucked it up! :)  well basically what i wrote was that i learned a big lesson and thats dont get greedy. i got greedy in two things and i got burnt bad. :) i came out looking like a jackass but the thing is i didnt mean no harm.  oh well, i would write more but im not really in the mood. only a couple of more days before i go on vacation which im really looking forward to. i need some r&r! if you get my drift! :)

      well..........  its been about 4 months since i last updated my old blog and you know what! what seemed to be a good idea like 8 months ago wasnt so good. sometimes things dont turn out the way you want them too. the month of may for me was definitely one of those months. seems like everything that could go wrong went wrong......  however now that i look at it maybe it was a blessing in disguise. maybe i needed that not one but 4 slaps in the face to finally come to my senses. :) what can i say im a slow learner. :) i guess everything in life is 2 steps forward one step back. well whatever the fuck it is i feel better off.  tonight i sat across two men in their mid 70's bullshitin..... telling stories about their life past present and future. two things that i got out of it...... sometimes the littlest things can change the course of everything....and the other is well i just forgot that one. :)

      why the fuck does it feel like im going through the same shit all over again? the whole desk situation which played out about a couple of months ago is happening again.... i also think i might have fucked it up again because i didnt open my mouth. atleast thats the lesson i learned. oh well we will see what happens.   other then that shit is the same as usual working my ass off. but i must say this move has gotten me alittle bit annoyed.&nbsp;i guess change is good and bad sometimes but no matter what its gonna happen. you get used to it thats whats life about i guess....... fucking shit :)  &nbsp;

      well.... im back home in the usa. :) its kinda weird when you just hung out with someone yesterday and now you cant see them and your about 10000 miles away. i mean its really bizarre.  when i was in brasil i spent the last day of my trip in this small village it was nice outside and we had a great meal. yesterday in my last afternoon in turkey i spent it on an island off the bosporus it was great. im glad i went.   i had a great vacation.... it was really good. now im back home and i think i have the energy again to finish the tasks i need to finish. plus the summer is not over here. i dont know but i love the summer... even if im doing nothing exciting during it its great!!!! however i hear this little voice inside me maybe its the personal legend shit i read about it this guys books ive been reading. we will see what happens. time will tell. :)

      ok so i am no longer with the girl if i havent told you then now you know. shit was going down hill and from her blog i knew what was up anyway but i didnt know it was coming like this. that she has been engaged and is set to get married. what the fuck went wrong. :) i mean i know what went wrong but the thing that pisses me off or gets me the most, ok things arent great the distance really fucked shit up but please dont make it look like i did something wrong or avoid the subject. thats what got me..... i mean dont send mixed messages. or try to send a message the wrong way.  well when she told me it wasnt a shock but i have to say i felt sort of stupid. plus i mean he looks older than my father :) he looks like he could be her father!!!!! and he has got this huge mole on his face! :) oh well beauty is in the eye of the beholder. hes beholding her alright and im here with my dick in my hand. :) thats usually the theme of my life..... oh well, i dont hold a grudge i hope she is happy but now i need something to make me happy.
