      I'll bring order to that ass like a drawer of mismatched socks--stacking rhymes like leg blocks. My logic is uncontested, so you'd better step to me rested, no mercy for the nervous, charge your pacemakers b/c I bury imposters on purpose. lol..

      Today my job isn't so bad at all..  I get to sit and watch videos to moby, boards of canada, stereolab etc..and type occaisionally. Today, I'm a casual observer of other people's pain. I'm pretending I'm making movies of their lives by switching to different tracks to find the appropriate sounds to which they should march. It's nice. And the hours pass...valgus, varus, valgus, varus. . .right, left, right, left, these people walk down the hallway, crippled with disease, but trying to keep a smile on their face, b/c...the camera's watching, and it's only appropriate that they look like they're enjoying themselves. Moby's "why does my heart feel so bad?" is quite appropriate. Back to work..

      I absolutely love the skeletons of buildings, especially at night when the metallic frames are ablaze with moonlight and 60watt bulbs. All the ants with hard hats have gone home to rest their weary antennae and leave me to look upon their day's work.  It's been such a long sad time since I've been turned on...like pulsing so hard all over that I'm vibrating. Terrible isn't? I feel like I need new batteries. [But what does THAT mean?] I do and don't mean 'turned on' in a sexual sense, but more so in a much more general way.  Remember those books, Where is Waldo? Your eyes would rape the pages in search for his striped sweater, and then when you found him, there would be this sigh of relief like you'd just recovered the child you'd lost in the grocery store isles. But..do you remember the look on waldo's face? This blind stare. It seemed to me, that he didn't want to be found..I feel like him today. But just today.

      sitting in one coffee shop of many, sucking up wireless internet like a junkie..so i'm nearing my leave. 40 days and I'm leaving Athens for good. People keep asking me if I'm scared or nervous. I keep saying no, because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be afraid of--am I just being naive or am I really void of fear? For some reason, I feel like most of my life has been I've been in solitude. It's like I live in this little room of my thoughts, and people come in every now and then to chat, to fall in love, or see what the hell I'm doing. I had this conversation with Anne the other night, we were sinking into the couch, immersed in some form of intoxication and we started talking about weddings. But I realized, why I probably won't have anything like that, ever..it's the purity that's sacrificed. It seems a bit ridiculous to me--sending out chalky white invitations splattered with fancy designs, "Kenshata and X would like to invite you to a special moment in their lives. We want to publicize our love..." I don't feel it's necessary to regurgitate my love for all to see. It's like this form of proof that I just don't need. (What are you there to see?) Those people just tack expectations, criticisms, and envy on to that love, weighing it down. It's so self righteous, weddings are. It's like saying, see, we can say forever in our vows that we childishly expect to withstand it's own existence. Weird, people actually believe that weddings signify the start of something...Here's a rule, if you have a wedding, you should have a divorce ceremony. Why not? Invite all those people who bawled and drank all of your free wine to come and enjoy the separation. Bring presents, gossip, and say "I told you so."

      Ahh. A&nbsp; long day on the grind...a long day is over and I'm thankful to be spelling out the day on this screen. Today, I was engrossed in this old New Yorker magazine. For some reason, I was also anti-NYer b/c I always felt like you had to be a certain type of person to read it. Dumb, I know, but it's damn good.  Last night, I went out to have a cigarette and ended up having a really eerie conversation with someone..for over and hour we talked about the details of dying, like the sounds one makes when expelling life. It was so..weird.&nbsp; As you can tell, I'm not far enough from the conversation to actually talk about it. Maybe another day. I had this realization about offspring today.. Children are simply the personification of every thought we've ever held. I almost don't feel real. We're all kind of in this recycling pool of knowledge. The same things are being discovered over and over again, but have different names. Every scientific discover is only reiterating a truth over and over? I'm just supposing people. Actually, I'm just trying to take up space. The truth is...I feel pretty good today,&nbsp;except my feet feel a little big.  'Few people, very few, have a treasure, and if you do, you must hang on to it. YOu must not let yourself be waylaid and have it taken from you.' -adios.

      in and out. you know, it's totally feasible. i could write in my blog everyday. i do have the time. in fact, i visit my own blog everyday to see if someone else has posted anything on it..lol. i'm a self-absorbed dork. my days have been flowing together. i don't get enough sleep. i make up for it in naps. i work. i eat. i smoke. i don't drink enough water. i miss. i bathe every so often. and i check jelena's blog. (i've given up on skye and rainbolt) nothing of importance to report. this week has been fairly uneventful. an umbrella has now been created at my work. all comments, shocking or not, fall under this umbrella and i'm some how protected from the shock. in other words. i'm getting used to hearing f'd up shit. here are scrawlings from little moleskin journal, forgive me, they're just dialogues in my head and probably don't make much sense. 1. hey. you. were. on. my. brain (now pleasantly stained). and. like. summer rains. you start. and stop. so often. that I  don't  remember when you weren't there.  2. Beautiful people, have all left the building. Insted of being, they crunch themselves into armani and other designer costumes hoping to imitate beauty which they interpret purely as style. Forgetting that personality needs to somehow be kneaded into dough filled pockets.&nbsp; So instead, they just "look good." The expensive shrouds cover their uniqueness and just transform&nbsp;them into factory workers in uniforms. You know what they DON'T say? You are what you wear. They sell their simplicity for... paper or plastic, sir? And with a bag full of individuality they walk away, proud of their purchase, and unaware that they just sold their soul to a Gucci god. Where are all the beautiful people? Zipped inside of starched pants and bold mid drifts and skirts that only reveal their flesh. I search the faces in the crowd for ones that are without concealer and I long for five o'clock shadows..ohhh the sexiness of rawness.  I wrote that..but then again, I am in love with a pair of Christian Dior sunglasses..and Coco Chanel..you turn my head everytime.  I'm out. I swear I'm going to get better at this.

      It's 3pm and I'm seeking refuge from the rain, in my apartment with tall windows that overlook a busy street and a high school the size of a castle. I kid you not, it's a beautiful building with windows the size of doors and ancient brick. I'm surprised by how much this city fits me. It feels like some part of me was born here long ago and trickled down to Rome, Ga. Now I'm reunited with it. Walking down the streets, the people shuffle past me, and sometimes they turn around and stare at me because I'm still in Athens stroll mode. There's no need to move fast.. Some smile, and slow down and maybe they notice something that they see everyday. There hustling doesn't irritate me at all, in fact it's rather soothing. The cars, people, and street lights are the instruments on 14th St's orchestra.. I put on my headphones and listen to them all at once.  My mood today is much like the weather, cloudy and rainy. It's the precursor to a period. The book in my bag right now is one of the most fascinating ones I've read in a while. Urban Poverty, by David Hilfiker, MD. I recommend that everyone reads it. The coolest part about reading it though, is that I have personal access to the author. On Tuesdays, we meet and discuss our week---highs and lows, the book, and whatever we want. He exudes serenity and wisdom(sounds hokey, but it's sooo true). And he really listens and returns thoughtful answers, and thoughtful silences--which are just as good as answers.  Had an epiphany in a coffee shop today, listening to anne's cd labeled "changes". She gave it to me right before I left and I put it on right as I got onto the plane. No doubt it made me cry  but opened me up to the great possibility that things will change b/w us. Can I love her in this complete and pure way that facilitates a FRIENDSHIP? I can't deny though, I've slid into bed and felt the absence of her curves against my body and wished to have her there to grab my hand to kiss it just before tucking it against her chest. It's an unlearning process. Yo..that's not my epiphany though. The epiphany was this--the ability of one person to change things. For a moment, it felt real. I felt like I could do..it. Except..I don't know what "it" is yet. But that didn't bother me. Change isn't only measured in permanence. It's measured in the span of a 'moment', in taking the time to hold the door open for someone, or saying thank you, or touching a stranger. For once I didn't feel overwhelmed and I didn't see change in the magnitude of moving huge granite rocks. I saw in the most simplistic light. Everytime we blink the world is made anew--b/c change happens in the shortest span of times. I felt so liberated. Today, I've been extremely introspective. (hence the long entry) I've thought about every action I've taken and it's consequences--not intentionally either. I needed badly to come back into myself for a bit. The last few days I've been void of internal dialogue--but it's lead to really great conversations and connections with people that I would've judged superficially otherwise.  I like who I am. I'm not matching today--my outfit is the color of the beach--which looks pretty weird in the midst of this concrete haven.  I thank my peeps back home for molding me..you're here, too. kw

      Aqui`.  Ah, yes, finally a moment to sit and kind of reflect on these past 48 hours that I've experienced. Life really changed in a matter of an hour and a half. First thing's first. The city: It's hella cool--old architecture, colored people, and style. The city's planned nice and neat so that getting lost is almost impossible. There's so much food and so much to do that I'm kind of overstimulated in a good way. Like the feeling right before you're about to orgasm. There's just SO much of everything. Every culture is trying to stick their fork into this city and claim a piece. I never even see the white collars.. It's like they don't even bother to come this way. There are SOOOO many gay boys, like I told Emily, they seem to be rising from the concrete like steam. Pictures later...as soon as I get to a wireless venue.  The job. Oh man. Intense. There's no such thing as small talk. It's like an Issue Soup. You name it, it's here. My fellow co-works (namely the interns) are pretty fun right now. We already have this steady stream of inside jokes going, and they're both so damned witty that it keeps me on my toes. My job consists of driving..more driving..parallel parking, and planning activities. Wednesday I host bingo nights and I've heard that it's a hit. I have a 600$ budget to plan for a month. In september we're totally going to cirque du soleil.  Anyways, I'm doing rather well.. I love and miss you guys, kw

       Off Day:    Woke up to the phone ringing. Thankfully it was someone I wanted to talk to...    Felt energized and went for a run. Wished for an iPod b/c my cd player felt oh so heavy.    Almost passed out from the humidity. Felt like I was running weird. Averaged 2.36 min/ lap. Felt pleased considering the state of my lungs.     Ran into a co-worker (The Law), feigned enthusiasm about her weekend wedding. Bolted to the Apt where air conditioning awaited me. Passed out on couch and made it damp and salty. Took off my shirt. Paraded around topless letting the artificial breeze cool my skin. Felt empowered.    Watched my laptop's screensaver. Consumed enough food that would supply me the energy to get to a place where there was more desirable food. Listened to music in my head b/c I was too lazy to turn on the cd player. Thought about showering. Thought about showering more. Stripped and showered. Thought about shaving. Thought against it. Got dressed. Considered cleaning my room, but the urge to escape was stronger. Packed my lap top and headed here. Where smokers are welcomed with ashtrays and coffee..and wireless internet. Sank into a couch.
