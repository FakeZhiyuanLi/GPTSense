        They say that honesty is the best policy. But is it necessarily the best thing if everyone ends up getting hurt? I mean, Im just tryin to do the right thing for everyone, but I just dont think its possible. Its such a fucked up situation and Im just tryin to deal with it the best that I can. Im sorry to anyone whos gotten hurt by all this...I swear, it was never my intention.

        Sup kids? So Im Drew and this is my first attempt at doin this whole Blog thing. Its probably gonna turn out like shit, because Im uber-lazy and highly doubt that Ill actually take time to update all that often. But yeah...Im 17 and from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Hmmm...what else? Im about to be a Senior at K-Central. Im semi-metrosexual (errr...Pseudo-Suburban-Metrosexual) but go more preppy than anything else. I run. A lot. Im sure theres more to say, but no one wants to keep reading this anyways, so Im just gonna shutup. So there ya go...my first post. Pretty deep, huh?
