      HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!! Today was interesting!! I feel like I have gained 4,983,539.02lbs. LOL! We had lunch at my Grandparent's house. Dinner at my Aunt Melanie's grandmother's house. (I sortive grew up around them all)! It was fun though... Dillian and I swapped licks for about an hour and a half lol! He is my age, but holy cow he is huge(stong wise)! I decided to leave my hair the way it was, actually, My Grandpaw liked it lol! The only one that made fun was my MOM! She is such a nerd(I LOVE YOU SISTER)! I hope everyone had a blessed and wonderful Thanksgiving!! I am thankful for life in general...God has blessed my family and I so much it is unbelievable: unconditional love for each other, financial stability, my education, the United States armed forces (I Love you, Justin and Jake), to have freedom..period, my family's support, friends that have been there through thick and thin, my shelter(religious and material), the courage to fight for what I believe in, the ability to achieve my goals and dreams, and so much more.....BUT Anyway, I gotta keep my two 8 year old counsins occupied! I love you all and hope you have had a wonderful thanksgiving! May God continue to bless you all!! ......*P!NK!E*

Autumn should be moving in sometime after Thanksgiving! I'm very excited...     My hair is in corn rows. I am debating on whether I should go to Thanksgiving dinner at my Grandparents and here what they think about them or just take em' out! They look wicked though! Anyway, I just thought I would update!!! Cyalllllllll... Love always... *P!NK!E*

      HOLA!!!! Sad to say that my Tag Board has also "past on", sadly, like Sarahs', Meagan's, and Jerrys...such a shame!!! ergh!!! What a day, what a day!! LOL!! Today I had got up at 7:30..whatever happend to that rule about sleeping in over the holidays? I guess it went doooowwwn the drain along with my sanity and patience =S EeK! Anway, the reason for my early rise is cause I had to be at practice at 9..YUCK...then I got out at about 12! It was rough, we had to do suicides cause we "pissed" him off! Glad that is over with...I came home and slept till 4:45! Then had Play Practice at 7..geesh! Anyway....I really should be working on my short story that is due on monday! It has to be 4-6 pages typed....and I haven't even started to think about anything... I need suggestions, if anyone has any. It is really *crappy* that we have to do that *bs* over a break! I talked to Casey last night on the phone for little over an hour. It was a good convo.... we talked about a lot, without getting upset or ticked at eachother...we were very understanding. I basically spilled myself, and now, for sure, I know I have done all there is to do. It is no longer in my hands at all. I will just have to wait...and for him, I have all the time in the world. It's weird though, to think about how things used to be, and then they can all just change so quickly. It's quite scary. I am just trying to stay strong and have patience and support.  Anyway, I have practice for an hour in the morningt then I have a game...against Woody Gap(away) @ 5:00pm... I am really glad I am playing this year... I have missed it... And I really appriciate my team AND coach. They have made me feel like I am part of the family... they are understanding and caring and play like a team should. Playing Coach Melton is a lot different than I expected. I regret not playing those two years... but I am back and am ready for the last 2 years. I get my lisence in like a month and 20-something days! I can't wait! Alright well I'm outta here....cyaaaallllll!! Love Always....... *P!NK!E*

      Howdy Yall! LoL! Hope everyone is great! I am doing better. Today Casey came to school...it was weird. It made me realize how much I miss him.

      Hey hey, I havent updated in a good while. Nothing really has been going on. I have just been here at my cousins house in forsyth all week. I should be leaving in the morning. I really don't have much to say. I am in one of those....um.... not happy moods. I think it's because tomorrow is new years. weird, I know..  I don't really know how to put the state I am in into words. I feel sortive...like there is just this huge blank. I don't know how I feel about certain things or situations. I am just all out tired I guess, of this way people are...in general. I guess maybe I just expect too much. I really should learn to not expect anything, from certain people. It's like, you thought you knew someone pretty well, but they do something that totally changes what you thought but not how you feel. I'm not really sure of how to explain it to anyone(what I am feeling or thinking right now) and that is prob. a good thing. I don't know, I am just going to go. I may write more later..but at this point I'm not really up to talk to anyone about anything I am feeling right now..........................................................

      Hey guys!! I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas or Holiday! Mine was great! I got really emotional because my Grandmother made a photo albumn and scrap book for me that had pictures from the day I was born to now, it was beautiful and so personal.  It's like I really prayed for my family for weeks before Christmas. I wanted everything to be so wonderful despite problems that are within the family. I just like created the whole feeling in my mind. I just asked God to give those that have hurt one another the strength to forgive eachother. And I prayed that you know, despite anything bad that has happend we could all come together as a true forgiving family and be happy. And really celebrate the Lord. I just wanted everyone to see what I saw. I prayed so hard, constantly. And Christmas turned out great. I was so greatful for everyone that came and got along and all the happiness I saw. The Lord is amazing, I am telling you all. I am so blessed to have such wonderful impacts on my life IN MY LIFE.   When my Grandmother gave me my gift it was great, but it also made me so mad at myself because I don't spend as much time with her and my Grandfather as I should. They are two totally different people yet so wonderful in their own ways. I love them so much and am so blessed to have them in my life.   I wanted everyone's joys and blessings of Christmas to truly glorify the Lord, and I got what I wanted for Christmas. It used to always be so much about what everyone gets for Christmas and how many they got or whatever. It isn't like that to anymore. And I love it. Praise God....  So, I am sitting here in Forsyth, GA. I miss my mom, omg...I am such a baby. I have always been a momma's girl though. It's cause she is my best friend! I love you mom!!!  We went to the Dawsonville outlets today, which are like 10 mins from the house. It was fun cause there were SO many sales. Like, Charlotte Russe....I got like 6 shirts and spent under $10 woohoo!!! It was fun just to hang out with Jane and Cadence(cousins, Jane is 18 and Cadence is 14)!! Tonight Jane and I are going to one of her bf's friends, he is having some people over I guess! I think Kc(Jane's bestfriend) is going to be there, which is cool! I have always gotten along good with her! She's really cool, a lot like Jane!   But I'm going to go, I wrote a lot today! WOOHOO! Everyone take care, and call my cell if you need ANYTHING!!!!

      Well Hello Stranger!! Yeah, It has been a while! Things have been good. I am starting to get over this terrible crap I have. It is awful!!!! We won both of our games this weekend!! Banks by 4 and Hayesville by ONE! So we are....5 and 1 now! WOOT WOOT! Hayesville is a really good team! I wasn't expecting to play at all this weekend cause I have been so sick. But she was like "YOU ARE GOING IN, GET UP" cause a few of our players weren't doing so good! I played a little while before I had to take a break. I still have the chest and head part of the flu, like runny nose, headache, and cough. I wanted to play so bad though. I played like half a quarter at Banks and scored 6 so it's all good.  It's getting R E A L L Y close to Christmas! YAY! I still have a little bit of shopping to do, but that can be done one late night at Wally World! LOL! Well I gotta clean my room MY BROTHER should be here soon =) yay!!! Cyaaaz

      Alright so....I went into school late today. I still feel terrible. I saw Jimmel and he was like you look really bad(THANKS A LOT) and if you don't feel better by the end of the day then don't come to practice. So as the day went on I felt worse. So nope, I didn't go. I have play practice here in a little while and I still have to fix my short story that is due tomorrow!!! =S anyway, how is that for an update!?

      omg...omg...omg...!! I have the flu. I started feeling really sick on the way down to the game. When I got there I was like okay...I am about to throw up so I went in the bath room and just kept choking...it was awful. I felt like my chest was caving in. We lost our game but the boys won. Way to go guys.  I got home at about 2 or 3 and took a little big of cough medicine and went to bed. Got up at about 11:30am ate something then crawled back into bed at 12noon. I didn't get up again till 3 this morning except when I crawled to the bathroom. That's when the throwing up started. I threw up twice. I feel so awful.. my head feels huge and my chest hurts...I am aching all over. Please pray for me to get better =( I got Graham and My Mom's presents today. I need to finish up Casey's and Autumn's and Chelsea's and Beth's LOL!!! but anyway.....I need to sleep. Bye =(

      yo yo yo! Today has gone good. Nothing big happend. Today I PLAY VARSITY. Wow...I am really nervous. But, I know that this is the only game that I will play V. this year. It's because we have 5 girls out. But Autumn said he wouldn't put me there if he didn't think I could do it. So, I am trying to stay positive.  I feel sortive like I am getting a cold! I have been taking Vitamin C though, so hopefully all will be okay. Tomorrow Pete is taking me shopping. YES!! I am excited cause I really need to shop for my mom and the rest of everyone else! Yay! Casey and I are "together" but not. It's weird...but I am still glad we are. He is great. Next thursday is our last day. It's only a half day though. I am very excited!!! But I am out, Cyeeeeeeee

      Well, today is a  LOT  better. I don't think I am getting sick. Play practice was good last night. Autumn and I sounded really good. She has such a  beautifu l voice. I talked to Casey last night. I got a lot out, it was just building up. I think that other things that  had been added on got taken out on him, I am sorry baby...I   love   you.    Brandon  asked me if I was okay, I guess cause of what happend at the game. I wanted to talk about how I was feeling but just couldn't. I appriciate his effort though.I am guessing that Cherise must of said something. ( Ergh , i won't go there though). It's getting closer and closer to Christmas. I am so glad. I am  SO  ready to go to Forsyth. (I  miss yall!!!) Anyway. I hope everyone did/does great on their finals! I have practice tonight from 5-7..bummer. It should be easy though cause everyone is sick =( !!! But I am going to go. Just thought I would update!

       OMG ....I am so annoyed! I don't really know why. I just am. I just had to write on here, I don't want to talk to  ANYONE !! I am just at this emotional state where I want to say FUCK YOU OR FUCK IT, to everyone and everything. ( Exuse my french )! It's like...what am I doing anymore? I don't know. I have my priorities all  * screwed *  up and I am freaking out. I am so stressed. Like last night, Shanley said something she didn't mean but it just went right through my heart. Tears just fell. I didn't mean for it to happen to her, and I am sure if someone would have said something like that to me before her I would have done the same thing. I guess things just build up...and it really gets old after a while. It's just so much harder now, I don't have Casey. I am trying to get things done for school. I have missed the dates when papers have been due. I am just lost right now. Today practice was easy. Since there are 5 girls out..with the dreaded  FLU !! Anyway, I guess I am just ready for my 2 week break. I am ready to go back to Forsyth, and get away for a little while like I did this summer. Man, I  love  it down there!! Love, what a  strong  word. I will  never  use that word again... ever .  I am just having a hard time right now and I need time to think and get my mind straight. But one thing I know for sure, if Casey and I don't get back together..I am done. Done with any sort of relationship. I knew I would get hurt in this one, and I did. I always get hurt. It makes me feel like a total jack ass too cause I'm so pathetic and helpless. It makes me so mad at myself. It's like, Atlanta, why do you always do this to yourself. Why do you let things like this happen to you. Why do you let yourself get so involved and be so stupid. I'm done...bye

Gotta give a shoutout to my girl Shanley, she puked today..I love you and hope you feel better. LOL! Anyway I don't really have much to say. But, all 3 towns teams won last night! Way to go!!! But I think I am heading out. Cyaaaaaa

We just hung out, ate doritos and watched a movie. It was still great being with him...Felt like we were "together". Anway...today was a lot better. I was tired but still pumped. Like, I don't know..I guess I just have days where I feel like being a complete B*tch(notice how I censored that) and then some days..I am just an all around nice girl(LOL). Today was one of those good days.  We had a game against Prince Ave. today. HOLY SHAT(T)!!! LOL, We beat them [51-8]! All four tc teams won! It was cool, even though the refs totally sucked!ergh!!(NUTS n BOLTS, NUTS n BOLTS...WE GOT SCREWED!!! etc)! so we are 3-1...totally cool. I really should go to bed, I think we are going shopping tomorrow! ergh. Spending money I don't have just sounds so fun! But I really need to get presents for everyone....erggggggggg!

      Today... Today, today, today...wow! I woke up late AGAIN so I couldn't go to FCA! I ate Combo's and a Sprite for breakfast! Went to Gainsville and The Mall Of Georgia! Practice... It started off terrible because we were so cold and we practiced in the little gym. We started with 11 man and it was awful. Beth didn't block out so we all had to run 8 suicides. I was pissed. But I still ran beside her and encouraged her to make the time. Coach Melton said that was very cool of me and that I stepped up and acted like a leader. Thanks JimMel...that made me feel a little better. I guess with things going on in and out of school it is hard to keep focused. My mom and I got into it when I opened the car door. Damn, that is the last thing I need. I mean hell...I opened the door and the first words were, "Oh My GAAAWWWDD(God)!!!!" WHAT THE HELL!?!?!(Sorry, I just feel like being really vulgar on this "entry" damnit!) You know, a person can only take so much of BULLSHIT until they totally just want to be a BITCH about everything. ERRRGH, okay I just think I should go before I have to start censoring this shit! HAHA, thanks for listening to poor poor helpless me(YEAH RIGHT) Anyway..I have a game tomorrow..come cheer us on!! Cyaaaaa

My contacts are interesting....they are sorta weird but I can see lol! Autumn moved some of her things over yesterday and we cleaned her room(that's bigger than mine) up some, it looks really good..I can't wait. I think it will be cool to have a big sister! Poor poor Pete...he will be the only guy, except "Max" lol(our dog)! I have talked to Casey the last two nights for a good while. They have been nice convo's...it's been 3 weeks. I miss him a lot...I guess we needed it though. Still doesn't change how much it hurts. I am doin better with it though. I just need to start thinking before I speak and act on things. It would probably help a lot out. Anyway...enough about the ole "love life" if that's what you wanna call it..lol.  I have practice today...ergh...and freakin' team pics which really pisses me off cause I had NO idea and I was planning on "bleaching"(CASEY) my hair tonight...so I didn't fix it today or even put make up on! EEERRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Whatever!  I need some tags....the ones that I had got deleted on ACCIDENT cause I screwed up my blog and had to do that part over:( sorry SA n MEAGAN!  We have a game friday and saturday(IF IT DOESN'T SNOW) It looks like it will tonight though...anyway I am heading out! Love Always.........

      Well, yesterday was our first game...we lost. 5-0 wow. We played really hard though and very well considering we had no subs, and several of our players havent played b4. We had a lot of fun though! They cancelled practice today, something about the feild was really screwed up. They also cancelled our game against union friday cause of the tournies. whatever. Tonight is wing night at yacht club and of course me n my girlies are gunna go! It's cool that we spend at least one night with eachother out of the week, I mean yeah we all see eachother at school but we never really hang out anymore....cept wed.'s....so it's nice to spend time with eachother. But I just thought I would update! cyeez

I will prob. stay with a, ali, and shl tonight...I think that was our plans. They haven't talked to me about again so I don't know.

For my bday my mom, autumn, casey and me went out to eat but then that weekend...WOW, i had a H U G E party at the cabins. It was fun! But I am a lisenced driver now. Weird.
