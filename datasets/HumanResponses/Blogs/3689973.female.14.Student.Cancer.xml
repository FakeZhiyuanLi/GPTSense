      Went 2 camp today but still nothing much happened. I'm looking for blogs like mine that are journals that I can read when I am bored which is a lot of the time. I'm storing the http thingys here until I can figure out how to put links in my side bar and figure out which ones I wanna watch.  urlLink The Life of Woo³,   urlLink A Day In The Life Of Jeffrey Macarone,   urlLink Cause I said so, and   urlLink My Blog  Got bored looking at them. I just looked at the interesting titles. I really liked this one title Random Mumblings and Fishsticks or something like that. Crud monkeys I 4got to shave again! O well even more fuzzys. Still hav more 2 say but am tired.

      Tried for a long time to fix up my blog. The only thing I did tho was a counter and a guest book. I think the 2 hits so far on my counter are from me looking at my own blog. The About Me thing is still not working. and neither is the chatterbox thing. I got a bug bite on my hand and its itchy. How did I get a bug bite? I was looking at other people's blogs and all of them r either all kewl w/links and stuff or not a journal type thing. neway none r like mine. Im watching that new show Quintuplets. I don't think its gonna last. Just like Andy Richtor's other show. On weekdays there will be more than just babbling in my posts. Ha I was just thinking. Like around the middle of the year I told my friend Hillary that I needed to learn how to babble. My notes were always so dull (not that there not now just a little less). She told me that u should just write what ever comes to mind. I think I took her advice a little too well. I need to shave. but theres not enuff time left. I guess I'll just b a little fuzzy 2morrow at Y Camp. Wahoo. I love camp. the reason I'm going to bed in less then 30 minutes. I am so going to take the week of 5-9 off. gonna go try to get my About Me thingy to work. TSCHÜS

      MoOoOoO Not even sure im doing this rite. This is my 1st time w/ a blog. Who cares tho no 1s gonna read this unless they stumble across it my accident or go 2 it from my msn profile. I stumbled across this website thing by accident. I was doing a report on seashores and i googled limpets in the image thingy. I clicked on the 1st one and it was in a blog. I used that pic in my project. So later, earlier 2day, I went back to it to read it more. so thats how i ended up w/ this. I don't exactly kno what is gonna b or if im even gonna remember i hav it. whoopeeee. so far its just gonna b my random mumblings. snib. tried to sunbathe on my roof 2day. didn't really work. I didn't fall off the roof or nething i just didn't really get a tan. Im just glad i didn't get burnt. Stupid adds!!! I should get that pop-up blocker thingy. it would probly make my computer even more messed up. I don't kno what I did but now there is a search bar above my start bar thingy. It's totally messed up my computer and i don't kno how to get rid of it. now when i get on my computer if I minimize something I can't see it untill a couple minutes later. Its like I hav to wait 4 it 2 load. Ha Donald Trump is the host on Satuday Night Live. I luv my http://www. thingy. Im not really brainless. But im becoming blonde. (no offense) my highlites r taking over. and im losing common sense (according to my Kusine). I saw this ad on TV 4 these pills that lower ur period to only 4 x's a year. They said it was safe but it doesn't sound like it. I guess thats if u don't wanna get pregnant. well i guess im done here.    Ya i did it wrong but i sorta fixed it.

      Just decided to do the blog thing again. But this is bad timing as I am going to Canada and will be gone for 4 days. Much (not really) has happened since I last wrote. I went to West Virginia with my mom, dad, two cousins, aunt, and uncle. It was ok. I think we would have been more fun if we had gone to North Carolina tho. The house was nice. I accidently ripped the rolly ottomon (or is it ottoman?). We went horseback riding up mountains. It was fun. A big downside is that the crimson monkey rode up on his cotton pony monday (our first full day) nite. AND!! We were walking down the road looking at stuff and we saw a hillbilly. He was missing teeth. And smelled bad. I guess this is mean. But who cares no one reads this ne way. At least thats true according to my guestbook. So i figure (bcuz of this) that either A) No 1 looks at my blog (2 every one who comes here is illiterate or (q you are all stupid people who do not read the top. Well poop on you shirt and call it ice cream! I think i would prefer A but 2's ok too. My throat hurts. I went to keystone today with camp. I wonder if thats why. But i only really went in the water a little bit. Yesterday we were sposed to go to Sandcastle but it was closed due to the weather. SO they rescheduled for the 19th. I thot this was ok becuz i was gonna b there but im taking the next week off. Actually i don't think this blog is gonna work when school starts. Because im going to spend all of my free time doing homework. wh-hoo. But in 9th grade they start our transcripts and i want really good grades. Well not weekends.  Will work on blog when get back on my week off. Just finnished this uber sad and uber good book The Time-Travelers Wife. I added it to my list of favorite books. I clicked on it but im the only one. Any one who reads this go find it and read it. Don't kno if its real appropriate for my age group tho. My back hurts from this chair. Bye. Poop-a-lump.
