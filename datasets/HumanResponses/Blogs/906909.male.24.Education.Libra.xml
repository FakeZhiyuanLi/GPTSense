       Finally finished my  urlLink concept map  on Instructional Design. Basically&nbsp;my views are centered around the business goals and the delivery. Don't have a lot of sound pedagogical knowledge to contribute (which is actually the main reason for taking this course, and hey, is this a critical incident?). I think the four components that are important will&nbsp;be the  learning goals, business goals, learning platform,  and  the learner . I think these four components have enough divisible elements in order to be treated in its own right.  &nbsp;

       I've been diligently reading the postings on instructional design, particular the concept maps and gawd am I confused. Concept maps seem a tad bewildering but it's likely due to my lack of exposure to it. Am toying with the concepts and trying to frame my scattered thoughts on instructional design and hope to have it posted soon. Wish me luck!

       If there are any readers mulling about, do forgive me for the constant drafts and revisions to a somewhat simple 'reaction' to Bates' article on restructuring universities for technological change. Am still finding my way around brevity and succintness so bear with me while I collect my thoughts.   Since this blog is primarily for my journal keeping and log, it will be a massive mess :) (that much I am sure) so readers, you have been warned!

       Reading Bates' article seems strikingly similar to experiences I've had in working with a local public university which at the time was going through the motions of adopting e-learning. Bates has striked many familiar chords, with the most reverb being in the areas of vision, purpose, and the ability of the teaching faculty to adapt to the new learning modes.   First of all, I believe that the impetus to adopt technology is no more an option for any university. Communications technology, primarily computers are for the most part an integral component in the course of study, rather than an option. It is the question of in what way can technology improve learning that should be the bigger dilemma needing address.   Basically, the experience I had with the university and the initial steps they took clearly highlights and supports the issues that Bates elaborated, particularly with regards to the organisation, vision, goals and overall implementation. The key problem areas will definitely lie in how the technology will be used, in what role, and by whom.   I think the key issue will lie with the teaching, particularly those involved in it. Technology is easy to have but getting lecturers who are accustomed to face-to-face teaching to deal with the dynamics of flexible online study may be unrealistic. I feel that expecting a university to adapt may not always be a viable solution as it may be more effective to create new departments and faculties designed solely for the provision and support of e-learning. Some universities have already adopted this approach, where a ‘secondary’ or ‘e-university’ is established.   The summary of my reaction to Bates' observations on the dilemma facing a conventional university in e-learning adoption is one of mixed perspectives. Being in agreement with most of his points, it is in my opinion that most universities are just too steeped in bureaucracy and with funds limited and disbursed, not able to establish a coherent and supported e-learning strategy for the long term. The task of changing firm mindsets and opinions on how learning is experienced is of mammoth proportions, especially when e-learning has not yet gained the credibility and trust as conventional learning approaches. (e.g. the Malaysian accreditation body for private tertiary education has yet to recognise e-learning).   Possibly when there is a firmer definition or groundwork made in e-learning technologies, to a point where the necessary bodies (e.g. governments) are able to easily acknowledge, accreditate, and assess will large public universities be able to take steps required in this change. I find it interesting to note that most of the successful universities that engage in e-learning and similar are very much focussed towards it with dedicated departments and staff, or plainly carrying the title of an e-university.

       For the first assignment of the course, I've decided to phrase my reaction to Bates' article on  'Restructuring the University for Technological Change'  as opposed to our thoughts on instructional design. Having some experience in working with a public university in Malaysia in adopting e-learning as a means for program delivery, I feel that this assignment will be a good reflection of my thoughts and observations from the university perspective.   First of all, I believe that the impetus to adopt technology is no more an option for any university. Communications technology, primarily computers are for the most part an integral component in the course of study, rather than an option. The Internet being the first resource stop nowadays, whether in study or in work, requires at least a basic knowledge and understanding of computers and key software (e.g. browsers). It is easy to gauge the importance of computers simply by the virtue that its absence is more noticeable than its presence. It is easy for me to agree then that 'intelligent application of technology can improve learning'. It is the question of in what way can technology improve learning, and that requires a reflection into the goals and roles of the university and their intended aims to allow a better address.   I had the opportunity of working with a local public university in an advisory position, assisting them in enabling e-learning via my company’s solution. The main drive behind their interest in pursuing e-learning as a viable alternative to on-campus study was so that they could reach a larger student base, higher than the university could admit on campus. With the plans for e-learning being on the drawing boards and meeting agendas for awhile, it took the contracting of a third party company to get things moving. Even with a fully wired campus and satellite high speed Internet access, the IT Department didn't have the clout nor the ability to go beyond the hardware and software into a learning solution they could use. Bates highlighted this relatively common dilemma, stating that universities sometimes over emphasise technology and neglect the people infrastructure, and/or the overall vision and strategy which should precede the adoption of technology.   Similarly, with the decision for the use of learning technologies at the university being made at the upper management, the actual academic body who will be at the working end of the technology was left both in the dark and without a forum for a sharing of views. This led to a great deal of confusion as to how to approach the very rapidly setup solution and how to effectively utilise it. A long term plan, designed for eventual assimilation of e-learning as part of the academic faculty’s competency and responsibility was implemented.  Basically, the experience I had with the university and the initial steps they took clearly highlights and supports the issues that Bates elaborated, particularly with regards to the organisation, vision, goals and overall implementation. The key problem areas will definitely lie in how the technology will be used, in what role, and by whom. A lecturer who is excellent in face-to-face teaching may not be able to understand and deal with the dynamics of flexible online study. Expecting a university to adapt may not always be a viable solution as it may be much simpler to create new departments and faculties designed solely for the provision and support of e-learning. Some universities have already adopted this approach, where a ‘secondary’ or ‘e-university’ is established.   The summary of my reaction to Bates' observations on the dilemma facing a conventional university in e-learning adoption is one of mixed perspectives. It is in my opinion that most universities are just too steeped in bureaucracy and with funds limited and disbursed, it is difficult to establish a coherent and supported e-learning strategy for the long term. In my experience, the transfer of responsibility and executionary role to a third party company with the skills, expertise, and ability to implement quickly and effectively can aid in the initial setup but it will still require a great deal of investment on the side of the university in terms of the people infrastructure. The challenge being the establishment and maintenance of an e-culture, designed in line with the vision and expectations of the technology while not neglecting the learning values that is hoped to be realised.   It is of relevance to note that the public university from where I draw on my experiences are in ways very similar to the University of British Columbia, from which Bates has drawn his observations and conclusions. They are both public universities that are government funded, with an original emphasis in research. Private universities, among them the  urlLink Multimedia University  in Cyberjaya, Malaysia has implemented e-learning as both a supportive tool for on-campus students and also a means in which to enable off-campus study in a very efficient and rapid manner, without most of the drawbacks mentioned by Bates. This I believe is due to a concerted and centralised effort by the university’s management and the division of academic staff into those involved in e-learning as opposed to face-to-face. However, with just a superficial exposure to the university’s roles and aims in their e-learning efforts, no firm observations can be made beyond assumptions.

       For the first assignment of the course, I've decided to phrase my reaction to Bates' article on 'Restructuring the University for Technological Change' as opposed to our thoughts on instructional design. Having some experience in working with a public university in Malaysia in adopting e-learning as a means for program delivery, I feel that this assignment will be a good reflection of my thoughts and observations from the university perspective.   Before that however, there are two questions to address:   What underlying principles do you use when preparing teaching/learning materials?  For the most part, I am a proponent of content aggregation, preferring to compile learning materials from a variety of sources and allowing students the freedom to review those they find most relevant. I am disinclined to lean towards one source as I find that in most areas of study, the value of the learning process is a result of the distilling of a spread of information of different purposes and slants. The same applies to teaching materials, of which I use only as a guide, to allow for a structured lesson to ensure that all required syllabus areas are broached within the time frame alotted (particularly for a face-to-face session). It is however inevitable that certain sources are 'emphasised' over others, particularly when the subject matter is more objective than subjective.   Do you rely on any theoretical frameworks to assist you in this preparation?  I am unsure actually, of whether my lesson preparation is based on any existing theoretical frameworks simply for lack of exposure. An underlying 'theory' constantly used will however be a learner-centred approach where learner understanding takes priority over preset lesson plans. Teaching guides are used to assist but the pace and scope of the teaching will echo with the learners' immediate feedback, within reason.   Having read Bates' article, I have to say that for the most part, the points and arguments reflect very typical issues and problems faced by universities when tasked with adopting e-learning (in whatever forms). However, the context of the article is written with the author's experience at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and thus may not apply to newer universities where technological change is more easily embraced.   First of all, I believe that the impetus to adopt technology is no more an option for any university. Communications technology, primarily computers are for the most part an integral component in the course of study, rather than an option. The Internet being the first resource stop nowadays, whether in study or in work, requires at least a basic knowledge and understanding of computers and key software (e.g. browsers). It is easy to gauge the importance of computers simply by the virtue that its absence is more noticeable than its presence. It is easy for me to agree then that 'intelligent application of technology can improve learning'. It is the question of in what way can technology improve learning, and that requires a reflection into the goals and roles of the university and their intended aims to allow a better address.   When I was working with a local public university, the main drive behind their interest in pursuing an e-learning delivered solution for a range of Master degree programs was so that they could reach a larger student base, higher than the university could admit on campus. With the plans for e-learning being on the drawing boards and meeting agendas for awhile, it took the contracting of a third party company to get things moving. Even with a fully wired campus and satellite high speed Internet access, the IT Department didn't have the clout nor the ability to go beyond the hardware and software into a learning solution they could use. Bates highlighted this relatively common dilemma, stating that universities sometimes over emphasise technology and neglect the people infrastructure, and/or the overall vision and strategy which should precede the adoption of technology.   Similarly, with the decision for the use of learning technologies being made at the upper management, the actual academic body who will be at the working end of the technology was left both in the dark and without a forum for views. Basically, the experience I had with the university and the initial steps clearly highlights the issues that Bates elaborated, particularly with regards to the organisation, vision, goals and overall implementation.   There are however noticeable exclusions. Bates iterated that 'computer technology is a major issue' for students. For the most part, most students in tertiary education here in Malaysia expect computers to be an integral part of the learning process, and they prepare for it by usually owning a computer themselves. Government campaigns spearheading computer ownership with discounts, rebates, and loan schemes has helped in the provision of the basic computing hardware for the majority of society but I believe it is essentially an IT embracing generation that is the main reason for this.   The summary of my reaction to Bates' observations on the dilemma facing a conventional university in e-learning adoption is one of mixed perspectives. It is in my opinion that most universities are just too steeped in bureaucracy and with funds limited and disbursed, it is difficult to establish a coherent and supported e-learning strategy for the long term. In my experience, the transfer of responsibility and executionary role to a third party company with the skills, expertise, and ability to implement quickly and effectively can effectively aid in the initial setup but it will still require a great deal of investment on the side of the university in terms of the people infrastructure. The challenge being the establishment and maintenance of an e-culture, designed in line with the vision and expectations of the technology while not neglecting the learning values that is hoped to be realised.

       As an avid blogger, with an active personal  urlLink blog  being kicked about for a couple of years or so, this platform seemed ideal for the record keeping of my study journal as I amble through the programs I'm taking with  urlLink USQ .   I'm also inspired by the other blogs of fellow study mates and hope that this journal will be up to mark!   For this semester, I'm taking on two subjects, FET5601: Instructional Design for Flexible Learning and FET8601: Teaching Online: Strategies and Tactics. With this being my first semester in the program, I am looking forward to the learning experience and sharing in the wealth of experience and knowledge that every one in the class contributes to.

       Instructional design is intimately tied with learning theories (Mergel, 1998). Whether it is consciously used or a happenchance, learning theories form the basis for the development of effective instructional design.  The ADDIE model (Analysis > Design > Development > Implementation > Evaluation) is a 5-step model commonly used in breaking down the process of formulating instructional design. The first phase of the ADDIE model, the analysis phase, is where the 'problems' or challenges of instructional design for a specific need/use is looked at and identified. It is usually unique to the task at hand and rarely can we employ a used analysis as needs, learners, technology, and many other variables are bound to be different and thus require its own unique approach (Clark, 1995).  “The Analyze phase is the foundation for all other phases of instructional design. During this phase, you must define the problem, identify the source of the problem and determine possible solutions” (Braxton, Bronico, Looms, 2000, p.2). The analysis phase precedes all other processes and requires an in-depth understanding of outcomes, expectations, and requirements before all else.  Instructional design ‘should’ be focussed on the learner. In any environment, whether online or physical, it is an understanding of how the learner gains knowledge and finding out the most effective way will likely be the key to good instructional design. Learning theories complement this step as it provides an existing framework to build from.  Joining the ranks of tertiary teachers just 6 months ago, my crash course in hands-on instructional design began with the task of determining an instructional approach with the given syllabus. The private education industry in Malaysia is strictly governed by an accreditation body that determines and approves all teaching syllabus. With a pre-designed syllabus and learning goals (that cannot be easily modified), the instructional design demanded attention and creativity.  The questions I posed myself included:  - What should be my teaching focus in class? - Can I expect students to engage in ‘required’ learning outside of the set class hours? - Can I grade students on learning outcomes beyond the syllabus? - What background are the students coming from? - What are their expectations? - Can they engage in independent learning and be able to think outside of the limiting syllabus? - What are the expected outcomes? - What is my expected role as a teacher?  I felt (at that time) that my analysis was sufficiently thorough, and that as a teacher, I was in a position to exert positive changes in what I felt was a stifling learning environment. The result of the instructional design process resembled a constructivist approach (a term newly introduced to me in this course) and consisted of a study guide with learning goals for each class, readings available online, and questions for discussion and to build further understanding on.  After a semester however, the instructional design has evolved into a behaviourist model, where learning objectives are specified and quantifiable (Mergel, 1998). The reasons for this were a wrong assumption of the learner and their expectations (e.g. their concern was passing exams by studying for what will be graded), and a gross ignorance on my part of established rules and requirements of the college (e.g. lecturers are not paid to sit in class and discuss but to ‘teach’ the full hours allotted).  In my situation, the instructional design had to evolve and even take on a new learning theory, even though a direction has been set and study guides printed. A modification of the class direction and a few more printed pages effectively took the instructional approach to a different level of conduct.  Lisle (1997) affirms the role of learning theories in instructional design but maintains that the process should be flexible and able to evolve with changes. We are not able to predict learning outcomes from any instructional approach and the constant flux in which learner behaviours and expectations are in, together with the changing nature of clients, educational institutions, and technology, all effectively discourages a singular approach in instructional design.  I feel that the analysis is a crucial stage in making educated assumptions about what to expect but it should not be too definitive as to prohibit any changes. The learner will be the heart of the instructional design so the result should be a learning environment that is able to grow with or adapt to the learner in achieving required learning goals (within the constraints of the ‘business’ of education).   (The nature of private (and increasingly public) educational institutions that are profit driven and with the heavy costs of technology, there is an emphasis to fall within budget, and on expectations that are largely that of the client (e.g. fancy technology) and teachers (e.g. automated functions) than the learner. Education is after all a business and the need to be profitable is a very urgent one).   Also, learning goals are definitely measurable and quantifiable. When engaged in a ‘formal’ learning program (where instructional design has its most relevance), there is a predetermined expectation that the learner should aim for. The Florida Gulf Coast University recommends that ‘course learning goals and objectives should be publicly available and explicitly communicated to the learner’. It shouldn’t matter what learning theory is adopted, as long as the learner meets the required goals. ‘We must allow circumstances surrounding the learning situation to help us decide which approach to learning is most appropriate’ (Mergel, 1998).  The analysis phase is crucial for identifying boundaries that will dictate the final learning environment and approach (such as budget, and available technology) and once this has been determined, the analysis should then shift focus to the learner and the possible means in which the learning outcomes can be expedited. This involves a good understanding not just of the learner but also of the possibilities available for the learning approach such as technology, teachers’ skill and experience, and external influences such as accreditation bodies.

       The ADDIE model is one of many models used in the development of instructional design. The ADDIE model basically stands for Analysis > Design > Development > Implementation > Evaluation. It is a somewhat linear model adopting a common sense approach in instructional design.  As to my understanding, analysis is the stage in which you take stock of expectations, objectives, and any other requirements whether imposed by resources, technology, or the people (clients/learners/teachers). Once a good analysis is complete, design can proceed that will be able to satisfy the primary goals.  Development continues right after design and once completed, implementation takes place. Issues here will likely to be technological or training oriented. Once everything is set in motion, an evaluation is conducted to ensure that all in well and on track.   The Analysis Phase:   Clark, D. (Big Dog ISD Page) describes the analysis phase as a  'Front End'  analysis where the main problem identification is performed. It is interesting for me to note that Clark, D. acknowledges that analysis is not just a one-time occurence (even though the ADDIE model indicates otherwise), but emphasises the importance of the initial analysis over all else.  The analysis stage is demanding and time consuming but very crucial. When I was assisting with instructional design for an online MBA program, the analysis stage was basically centred around the client (in this case, the university). The weak acknowledgements on learning pedagogies resulted in a poorly delivered learning outcome that demanded increased attention and efforts on the teachers to remedy the lack of 'learning' from the system.  Clark, D. elaborates on tasks, performance measures, and instructional settings as other important elements in the analysis stage. It appears to me that this identification of measures and settings will boost the effectiveness of the evaluation stage by providing a platform for the evaluation process.  Personally, I feel that the ADDIE model is a simplistic approach to developing instructional design that also allows for a deeper and more complex approach to be undertaken. A key issue I believe is that the model should not be conducted just in a linear fashion as analysis for example, can be done in smaller scales throughout the instructional design process.

        Reflection:   This week has been a bit slow as I was occupied with a fair bit of stuff at work. Reading focus however has dealt with constructivism (and my still unfinished Wilson's reaction) and the ADDIE model.   The ADDIE model is not entirely new as I've used it during my short stint in instructional design. However, as indicated, the Analysis part was largely skipped and resulted in a very pedagogically unsound result. However, the infusion of multimedia and a snazzy LMS overshadowed the shortcomings.   Am committed to make inroads into understanding this model. Am also thinking about the proposal and figuring out the requirements of the course project.    Action:   Reading up on the ADDIE model, particularly analysis and am contemplating the project proposal.   Observation:  The emphasis on constructivism is still demanding understanding and relevance though light is streaming through. Being unable to decide on a project proposal I'm happy with is delaying work on the graded Discussion Activity.

        Wilson, B. 1997, Reflections on constructivism and instructional design   Wilson's article is a very refreshing insight into the debates and perceptions underlying instructional design. What strikes me is the prevalence of content related issues which to me sums up my dilemma of supporting learning objects and trying to figure out the constructivist approach to learning.  Wilson quotes,  'You have put your finger on a fundamental difference in approaches taken by those who believe that instruction can be designed to teach knowledge and those who believe that knowledge is constructed by learners....I would go so far to say that the two positions are irreconcilable.'    Although he continues that reconciliation is not really impossible, but his position does reflect on my views on instructional design as well. Personally, I have my doubts about construtivism. It seems to apply only to students able to muster independent thought with adequate knowledge pre-existing (as Moodie suggests). But with the focus of flexible learning being the ability to address large student numbers suggesting that undergraduate programs and lower will be of greater relevance, the adoption of a constructivist approach might alienante a lot of learners.   From Wilson's elaboration, there is a certain justification for constructivism. At this point, I feel like I have to decide on which approach to adopt. A lot more reading will be necessary for a more formative judgement to be made.   This reading reflection is still incomplete but will be returned to after I get some sleep :)

        Reflection:   The past 2 weeks has been eye-opening and challenging to say the least. Even though I'm taking two courses, FET5601 has been the 'pilot' as I was absorbed with it for the whole first week at least.   The group has been dynamic and that's actually a surprise. Big number as well. The experience so far has been exciting, nervous, and a little wary of what's ahead.  What's clear to me is that my definition of Instructional Design is vastly different from the majority. Taking a more technologically driven approach centering around Learning Management Systems and Reusable Learning Objects, I am finding myself a little without company. There is a stronger emphasis here on teaching and learning theories, with a focus on constructivism.  I've been exposed to concept mapping and I think it's quite a novel approach. However, it does take time to construct, so it strikes me as more of a 'final' presentation approach. It's easier for me to construct a linear text based concept although the drawbacks of that is apparent when concepts cannot be easily linked.  There is also some exposure on the concept of flexible learning. It has been novel to see that flexible learning is more than just e-learning, which may not be flexible at all! There is still a lot to learn.   Action:   Completed my reaction to Bates' article and did my first concept map. A lot more to do and read however. Have to firm up my understanding on learning theories, and try to find an approach to Instructional Design that I can relate to.    Observation:   My shallow knowledge of learning/teaching theories is hampering and it's taking time to absorb new understanding. Am also finding it difficult deciding on which readings are important. Will appreciate a more visible guidance from Shirley although she has made it clear that peer to peer interaction is part of the process. The problem I have with that is I don't know whose opinion to base my judgements on. Certainly an interesting and challenging process.

      Flexible learning, in my view, can be defined as a learning process that involves elements of self discovery, exploration, independence, and control on the part of the learner. It is a learning 'mode' that allows for learning goals to be achieved through numerous alternatives as opposed to the directed 'classroom' approach.   Flexible learning is strongly associated with technology, simply because the nature of technologically driven distance learning is built on principles of asynchronous delivery, learner centered learning, and having facilitators rather than 'teachers'. Most e-learning programs are by its nature 'flexible' as the global reach of such programs creates a situation where synchronous learning is rarely possible, and because in my view, being Internet oriented, it adopts the anytime anywhere 'culture' of the online environment. For example, physical banks may have banking hours but online banking is 24/7.   However, like Taylor mentions, technology is not what drives flexible learning, nor is the reason for it. It is the fundamental learning goals and theories that will be the main impetus for flexibility. Garrison spoke of 'computer conferencing' moving on from an industrial era of mass 'production' to a post-industrial period of learner centric approaches. There is a clear rationale in disassociating technology with flexible learning, simply to avoid an over emphasis on technology and ignoring other important areas such as learning goals and direction.  Flexible learning is an outlook, a new perspective into how we learn. Flexible learning is not taking classroom syllabuses and making them digital. To implement effective flexible learning requires an intimate understanding of all the elements involved in the learning process, with the priority being the learner. With that said, technology is definitely a much useful tool. The Internet has bridged people together, putting them in a new learning environment with strong mimicry to our real-life behaviours, and interactions like never before. It will be rare to see truly flexible learning being done without any infusion of technology.

      Moodie, G. ‘  Virtual university: Real learning  ’  Moodie talks about four ways in which learning takes place;  observational learning, directed learning, guided independent learning,  and  autonomous learning.  Using these four approaches as a definitive guide to encompass all possible learning modes, Moodie basically surmises how flexible learning falls under the guided independent learning category.  What's interesting to read here is how Moodie relates the learning process to the learning skills of the learner. With the increased independence from structured guidance in guided independent learning and moreso in autonomous learning, it is sensible to expect students to usually be mature and likely to be undertaking short courses or courses at postgraduate levels. However, I feel there are some shortcomings to Moodie's view on learning.  Moodie allocates&nbsp;online learning in the category of guided independent learning, essentially stating that online learning is an ideal mode only for higher education and for older students. This position means that primary and secondary schools will be overlooked and undergraduate programs not seen as ideal for delivery in the online learning mode.  Also, the simplification of the learning processes into just four distinct categories means we are bound to overlook hybrid systems or situations where flexible learning is integrated in part into more conventional systems. Furthermore, the main drive or enthusiasm for flexible learning stems from the ability to empower 'conventional' learning and also to provide greater learning access to a larger population, basically meaning that the programs to deliver will be largely undergraduate and school oriented, in opposition to Moodie's summary.  I feel that flexible learning still warrants greater discussion but in the meantime, we shouldn't over classify or be too eager to construct too firm a definition for a whole new learning process that is still very much evolving (especially since it is technology reliant).   &nbsp;

      Garrison, D. Randy ‘  Computer conferencing: the post-industrial age of distance education  ’   Took a few re-reads (simply because my mind wandered now and again) but I think the gist of the article is the reshaping of what is termed 'computer conferencing' (which strikes me to be another label for flexible learning) and how it has evolved beyond an alternative to mass education.   The concepts of constructivism, where learning is constructed by the learner and made relevant with past experience and knowledge, is prevalent here. This is currently the first article I've read that bases itself on this theory of which I am still struggling to define.   There is little here that I find to be in disagreement, partly because I think this article, being written in 97 provides more of a retrospect than a forward thinking discussion. However, it has never occured to me to view the early models of 'computer conferencing' as an industrial era driven system, where mass production and broad delivery is the dominant approaches.   Garrison's view of the 'post industrial' period for 'computer conferencing' seems ideal, and considering the current trends of flexible learning, holds some truth. It is most sensible to view students of this time and age (us including) to have higher expectations for 'computer conferencing' and to view it not as an alternative to on-campus study or face to face interaction, but simply just another way to learn that is not deprived of any substantive benefits nor efficacy. But like Garrison pointed out, it's not always easy for 'traditional' universities to change nor adopt new theories or learning concepts without a lot of resistance.   I find it very pleasing to my ego to see that Garrison proposes new educational organisations be set up, instead of taking the task of changing old ones. This is what I have been believing all this while, largely reinforced with my experience in e-enabling a very traditional public university in Malaysia, and at the same time observing the speed and efficiency of change in a private university that is rooted in technology. Looking at universities who are excelling in flexible learning, it will be obvious to see that their priorities are flexible learning. Universities who adopt flexible learning without a clear focus will usually have that extension being driven without direction.   In summary, it is not hard to see how social context and interaction will play increasingly important roles in flexible learning, with computer conferencing being the key delivery mechanism. Learning takes place most effectively when we are dealing with people, not machines nor context absolved information. It may not be the classroom but computer conferencing is the next best thing.

      Farrell, G. M.‘  The changing face of virtual education: Introduction  ’   This text focused on the rationale and developmental patterns of virtual education (and all the other labels attached to it such as flexible learning, e-learning, and etc.). I found the points to be salient, though not quite foreign. There is definitely a need to maximise learning efficacy and with the advances in communications technology, it's not surprising to see educational institutions and other key players moving in step.   At this point though, I must reflect that there is very little said about effectiveness of technology. Although it has been shown that technology does little but to provide a communicable platform, I feel that the choice of learning platform and the way the learning objects or learning materials are presented can assist in the learning delivery.  I've also noticed that unlike more conventional learning approaches such as face-to-face instruction, virtual education seems more entwined with business goals. Maybe it is because of the immense costs involved. Virtual education is a massive investment although open source has enabled e-learning adoption across a wider scale.   Reading reflections so far have impressed upon me the importance of learning theories and instructional design, usually based on sound pedagogical approaches developed from face-to-face sessions. This strikes me as somewhat interesting as I would think that online learning will require a whole new set of pedagogies that may or may not have anything in relation to conventionally delivered education.

        urlLink Technology, Pedagogy and Globalisation   James C Taylor, USQ  Can't help but to agree with Taylor that technology is nothing but a tool to deliver education. We sometimes get too caught up with what technology can do that we forget what they're supposed to be doing in the first place. This program for example has discussion boards as the primary mode for interaction and this at a time when instant messengers, webcam chats, and many more 'fancier' tools for online interaction exists, yet the communications gets by just fine.   I think the 'heart' of any learning process is the learner. The learner is really in control of the learning experience, in whatever mode. In a classroom, although learners are paced and guided, if the learner insistently refuses to take a proactive role in the process, it will be hard for any learning outcomes to arrive.   In flexible learning, whatever the mode, the basis is the idea that the learner is in control and there really isn't any point for control when it isn't fully employed. Studying online for the first time, the process is really rewarding. I am able to maintain my job, my responsibilities and still able to further my education by ensuring I commit some time each day, times that are at my convenience.   There are however certain drawbacks that are noticeable. Unlike my first degree, where the learning outcomes were clearly spelt out in class by the lecturer, having the responsibility in deciding what you learn on your own shoulders is surprisingly daunting, especially when the measure of your learning will be graded. It is both a unique and eye-opening experience that will warrant a lot of critical incidents throughout.  All in all, the final emphasis on the role instructional design plays is certainly more than justified. Like Taylor says, the technology employed and the manner in which the learning is disseminated will be meaningless if the quality of the instructional message falls short.

      Been neglecting my other course, FET8601> Teaching Online: Strategies and Tactics just a bit. It's just that FET5601 has a more active online community. Really makes a huge difference in getting the involvement process going.  I've been on top of tasks so far but a little behind on the reading. Made a mistake in taking these two courses together. Kinda sheepishly read the recommendation that learners should take 5601 before 8601. Guess I was a little too keen on getting started and enrolled!   Will have more reflections on this once I get into it. Trying to figure out an efficient way to balance the two.

      As an avid blogger, with an active personal  urlLink blog  being kicked about for a couple of years or so, this platform seemed ideal for the record keeping of my study journal as I amble through the programs I'm taking with  urlLink USQ .   I'm also inspired by the other blogs of fellow study mates and hope that this journal will be up to mark!   For this semester, I'm taking on two subjects,  FET5601: Instructional Design for Flexible   Learning  and  FET8601: Teaching Online: Strategies and Tactics . With this being my first semester in the program, I am looking forward to the learning experience and sharing in the wealth of experience and knowledge that every one in the class contributes to.

       Reflection:   Am doing a learning log for both weeks 3 and 4 as work caught up with me and led to a some neglect on the readings. Thus didn't do as much as I should in the past 2 weeks but hope to make up for it in the weeks to come!  I missed out on the chat session! Timing wasn't too great though. Being 6pm - 8pm Malaysian time, that's smack in my commute home and even though I was back after 7pm, way too exhausted to log on and engage in a cognitive social activity. Will be nice to have a chat session on a Saturday. We'll see when the next one is.  I have mixed views over a synchronous online activity. The class is just too large to have an open chat. I feel it should be conducted in smaller groups but that will probably demand too much time on Shirley's part. The nature of the Internet being inherently unstable and not particularly 'synchronous' (lagging and flooding a common event) doesn't quite make the idea very appealing. But I will save my reservations until I get a go at it first.  Am still perplexed over the learning theories and am still wondering why the constructivist approach seems to be seen as the best approach? Read somewhere that the leaning towards constructivism is largely due to the nature of the online system where the learner is empowered. Plus it's easier to design a flexible learning environment on an asychronous user independent platform. Likely to be true but not a measure on learning effectiveness, which another forgotten article mentioned how no single learning theory has been shown to be better than another.  Overall, the course is starting to make more sense. And that's good.   Action:   Posted my first critical incident. It's a graded assignment so it's a tad daunting. Am hoping for the best!   Observation:   Most forum postings go unheeded. It's definitely ideal in a constructivist environment to foster peer interaction and knowledge generation but if no one participates, and the facilitator isn't always there, it makes for a challenging learning experience. Have decided that it's probably easier for the moment to read up on the other postings. Will have to read more about 'vicarious' learning and how learners can lurk and creep around other interactions and take part in the learnings going on.

       Critical Incident 1   The first four weeks into this program has been both challenging and confusing. Challenging because coming from a design and technical oriented background, a lot of the learning theories are unfamiliar. Confusing because my experience with teaching online revolved around largely technical aspects of LMS manipulation and using learning objects.  It was difficult trying to find a cohesive link to my experience and prior knowledge, to what is being explored and discussed, an important component in constructivist learning (Hein, G.E., 1991). I felt that my experience lacked the depth required for understanding and I was overwhelmed with trying to catch up. There was also a feeling of frustration as here I was with ideas and experiences from valid and existing examples of flexible learning here in Malaysia, with limited applicability in a theoretically driven study of pedagogies in this course.  Basically, I felt like a student who couldn't catch up. It reminded me of my current students in class who sometimes complain of being left behind. As the teacher, my responsibility is to 'teach' to the majority and with a tight semester schedule, there is little room to slow down. Similarly, I felt that I shouldn't constantly forward 'queries' when everyone else is contributing towards a deeper understanding.  What happened then resulted in the 'A-Ha!' moment that is pivotal in the learning process (Sparke, J. & Skoyles, P., 1998). Putting forth some of my concerns in the discussion board and in my learning blog, I was pleasantly surprised to see some answers and support forthcoming from my peers. What happened next was because my peers were not in the authoritative role of the teacher, their input was taken and echoed with my understanding and experience, not blindly obeyed. And there came an immediate understanding of the constructivist learning model, and the roles played by 'teachers' and 'peers'.  Unlike the physical classroom, there are no fixed classes and teaching times to concern with online. Learning goals are at the pace and flexibility of the learner, and this is unique to the flexible learning environment. The role of the teacher is also vastly different (McPherson, E., 2002). In class, as a teacher, I am expected to know-it-all and students look up to you for knowledge. In the flexible learning environment, particularly online, there is little to 'look' to in a visual and social sense, and thus in some ways diminishes teacher authority and results in a more exploratory learning process that is done together.  The question for me is how do we ascertain the roles of teacher and learner in a flexible learning approach? It is inevitable that there will be a host of varying approaches, not just within a program context but sometimes even on a smaller scale. Looking back at my experience, the learning process could have been expedited if I had managed to find my 'role' in this process, which is more than just a follower but a contributor. Feeling empowered allowed for a more proactive participation which then led to a deeper understanding of the learning expectations.  However, how is this role 'setting' done? Course objectives and pre-launch information clearly highlights the 'constructivist' approach taken. Could there be more than just defining roles? A Survey by the Australian National Training Authority, 1998 mentions that it is not so much the learning style a learner has but the skills they have to manage their own learning. Maybe it wasn't the role awareness but the change in learning styles from wanting to be spoonfed information to proactively seeking it out that made the difference.  There is clearly a big distinction between traditional teaching and teaching online. The nature of the online medium clearly discourages or limits some traditional teaching components, such as physical observations of the learner, which affects the way teaching is conducted. The ability to empower learners online (via discussion boards and other asynchronous interaction) allows for learners to be more participative, and some measure of anonymity may entice shy learners to speak out. However, this does not mean that learners will automatically adopt a new learning stance, as in my case. There must be a definitive effort taken to 'adjust' all learners to a style befitting the program and this style is not necessarily homogenous, as long as it is suitable with the pedagogy employed.  The role of the teacher is thus ever more important. Although the authoritative role of a dominant teacher is less employed, the need for a facilitator and guide in this learner centred approach is ever more crucial online, maybe even more than in the classroom (EPS380, Proficiencies, Standards, and Test Fundamentals).

       Reflection:   Am doing two courses for my first semester and kicked off my studies for this a little later in the week. It has been a challenge but this subject seems a little more manageable than FET5601. I suspect it may be due to the tamer discussion forums. FET5601 has forums that just keeps on going! :) As interesting as it is, it does make for a tougher time getting to grips with an approach or idea.  Have been doing the readings and there seems to be an effort here to distinct the roles of technology in flexible learning. Once again, the focus is on teaching and learning theories (with Shirley facilitating both courses, it seems unlikely for the focus to waiver too differently), particularly on constructivism. The idea that the learner shapes the learning is interesting but I can't quite see it as being the only way to go. For example, the focus in this subject is contructivism and discussions are centred around it but it is only an emphasis because the syllabus or facilitator has made it so. Definitely need to build up my knowledge on theories in order to formulate a more 'academic' perspective.  There is also an attempt to define flexible learning. Really an interesting and challenging task since this was one of the few questions I had early into the course. My summary is that it empowers the learner but it is inevitable technology related.   Action:   Took part in the group activity defining Netiquette and Rules for Interaction. Was an interesting exercise in 'wait and see what happens'. It's very difficult going about a group activity through a discussion forum but things worked out. Thanks in large to a few who volunteered extra effort in compiling thoughts and steering the discussion. A leader is essential in these situations.   Observation:   This group is not as active as FET5601. It occured to me that maybe FET5601 is more robust because most everyone there is new. But that's just an unfounded thought. On more relevant issues, am a little puzzled with the topic goals still. I guess my preoccupation with technology might be a problem as I can't grasp how teaching online can be taught without an emphasis or examples of teaching technologies which drives most flexible learning. Plus if the constructivist approach is taken, there really isn't much 'teaching' to be done. It's very confusing still.
