      So the  urlLink Burma  show... I gotta say, had it been anyone else, I might have left a tad disappointed.  But then again, if you had asked me four years ago if I thought that a show like this would ever even occur, the answer would have been a resounding  no .  They rocked pretty damn hard for a bunch of guys that doubled my age with ease.  The new songs translated well, and the old songs...  Let's just say that when you're singing along, and the fortysomething standing next to you is singing along as well, and then you realize that he was probably singing along  before you could talk , it's a pretty powerful thing.   Mica  was definitely a favorite.  After the concert let out, we wandered around  Fenway Park , where the fans were pouring out into the streets.  The smell of the vendors' carts permeated the night air; car horns honked and people cheered.  It was a glorious evening.  On a completely unrelated note, it seems that if you're a girl, and you're single, and you're awesome, then living super far away from me is apparently all the rage.  Out of the country, out of the state, out of the city -- take your pick.  Sayin'.

      So here I am, back in Massachusetts in all of its wooded glory.  Tomorrow, I head into Boston to see the legendary  urlLink Mission of Burma .  The new record sounds like they recorded it in 1983 (which is a good thing).  Full details to come.  By the way, thanks again to everyone who came to our show the other night; I had so much fun.  Extra special thanks to  urlLink Nate  and  urlLink Aaron  for putting up those pictures.  You two are the best.  I owe you both a drink when I return to Madison.

      I have nothing to eat in my house.  I don't get paid until Tuesday, and I  could  go shopping, but the fact is that I'm leaving two days later.  So until then, I could continue to eat whatever is convenient and continue to feel like crap, or I could get my hands on some quality eats and pass whatever is left onto the roomies.  There's also the small matter of my inability to cook.  Suggestions, anyone?

      I haven't been updating because I have no internet at my house.  Blogging at the downtown MATC library just doesn't feel right.  I should return by late August with any luck.
