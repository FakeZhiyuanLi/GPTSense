      I decided that maybe that wasn't a very good way to start off my new blog. I told you all about me, and how stuff around me is going, but I haven't told you anything about my plans for the rest of the summer. Aside from working, I am hoping to get my own Xbox, and stop borrowing my friend Alyce's. She is gonna want it back pretty soon, so I need to get my own. My girlfriend, Jessica, is trying to help me, but her mom is too mean to let her. She's gonna be moving pretty soon, and we still don't know where she's gonna be. Well, since that about wraps things up, I'll let you all get back to your daily lives, however dull they might be.

      Hi everyone! My name is James, and if ya read this, you will be one of a few people that know a lot about me. Most of my friends might read this, if they want to. I don't really feel like making them read it, so I won't. I'm mostly a passive person, and my favorite hobby is a quiet and peaceful one. I am an impressively good gamer. I am currently working on Halo, and Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, both for the Xbox. That should be enough of an introduction, so...  Right now, i'm listening to my favorite Musicmatch Radio station, Alternative Rock. My girlfriend might be coming over in a few hours, after work. I work at the same place as her, our local McDonalds. It's not bad work, pretty easy, and the pay's not too lousy either. We just got off school, our sophomore year. That's about all I have to say on this post, but i should update often, so keep reading, ok?

      My recommendation: Tater Tots. Yes, not only am I actually cooking for myself, but I am making Tater Tots, at 2 in the morning. I am a little tired, but the coffee will take care of that. Oh yes. Tater Tots. Beware their awesome power.

      I know now that my laptop will be arriving at my door sometime on the date of Thursday, July 1. It will be so awesome. I will be able to use the internet in the kitchen. I can tap into others' networks with my wireless internet capabilities. I can look up cheats in mid game without having to go to a big clunky desktop PC and try to find where I have placed the keyboard. No more long cables, no cables at all (unless I am charging it). This is the day I can truly go wireless.

      Today I had to make what would be a tough choice for most people. I had to choose either to buy a new part to fix my '84 Pontiac Fiero, or to get my laptop about a week early. I chose, of course, the laptop. I can't drive my car until I get my license anyway, but at least I'll have the part probably 4 days after I pass my driving test.

      Yep, I got nothin' else to talk about. I'm gettin' a laptop. WOO-HOO. It will be here in a few days. I failed my driving test today. I will pass Friday, as my mother decided to train me; my dad used to be teaching me. He obviously doesn't know how to pass a driving test. Oh well, at least I get paid in a few days.

      Ok, now some new stuff has happened. My sister is here now, with both her kids. They might be here a while. I dunno what else is gonna happen, but that's the most important thing. My sister's safe again.

      Well, this has got to be on of my favorite birthdays. My sister is in jail now. My brother hates everyone and has completely lost it. Everyone except him cares about my sister. It's around 10:30 and I'm still awake. I don't really know what else is going on. All I know is that this is the worst time I have ever had in my entire life.

      With my birthday comes presents. My girlfriend got me a new GameBoy Advance SP, the NES classic edition. It's just what I wanted. I got me the classic Super Mario Bros. for GBA.  It's just one of the classics that I want to get. Everyone else got me like money and cards and stuff. So, technically, they got me my next classic, The Legend of Zelda. Alyce is going to get me The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. It looks really good from what I've seen. Then comes the gift from my parents. In the past, their presents have ranged from socks to video games. This year they did the unthinkable. They not only got me a set of house keys and car keys (for both cars), but they ordered me a new laptop. It will be arriving in around 1 week. This was very unexpected. I will work hard to be able to use the keys by passing my driving test on Friday. (1 day till my birthday)

      Once again, I get paid. My tiny little check should pay for my birthday party on Saturday, with maybe enough for me to buy one or two of the classic NES games for GBA. I want to get The Legend of Zelda, and Pac-man. I always loved those games. I do want to try the Ice Climber game too, but I may not have enough money. I already finished getting my dad his father's day present. I made him a CD of Rush songs. If I do have some extra money, I'd also like to get The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. It looks like a lot of fun from what I've seen, and of course, who can pass up a new Zelda game. Only 4 days until my birthday. WOO-HOO!!! I'll finally be able to get my license. Then I can drive. I'm thinkin' road trip to France. Yeah, I know what I said.

      Yeah, I've been watchin a lot of tv lately. Everything is working out alright lately, since I called Stephie. I'm certainly feeling better, and I hope she's feeling even a little bit better. I should get back to whatever it was I was doing, or at least figuring out what that whatever was.

      I have been watching the episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Force that I have on my hard drive. I can almost recite "Mayhem of the Mooninites" word for word. I am of course just saying this since I have done nothing interesting in a long time. "Where shall I place this wet, primitive Earth towel?"

      I have formed a new alliance. Myself, Jessi, and Aaron have formed the smithing clan of the Lords of Metal. We'll help all the world with their metal troubles. I only am posting this because nothing interesting has happened. My bithday is in 12 days, and then i'll get my license on friday, and just like drive everywhere. So... uh... that's all I got.

      Last night, while I was not sleeping, I had this really weird dream. When I was awake and playing Runescape, I was running through the wilderness, until I could get to a point where I could use my Teleport spell, since the wilderness blocks Teleports up to level 20, and then I guess I spaced out. I was then inside a weird dungeon. I attempted to pull out a weapon, but my sword had disappeared. A strange flowing black thing wooshed over to me, and tapped me on the head. It told me, "you will not live to see your next..." then the radio snapped me out of it. I don't know what to think about this. Oh well, at least Hydra22's ok.

      As my gaming session continues, I figured I should take a little time to share with you some of the games I have found myself dominating. Not only am I playing the game to recieve over fifty awards, Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, but also Halo. For the GameCube, I've been playing Custom Robo. My favorite combination of parts is the Javelin (a Strike Vanisher model), the Shotgun part, the Wave Bomb part, the Aerial Freeze pod, and Booster legs. Of course, if I get the chance, I am so gonna put the Rahu III gun on him, the Shotgun is way too short-range. Along with all of these, I am revisiting one of my old favorites, Runescape. This game can, of course, be found at www.runescape.com. If you decide to play, or if you already play, my username is Hydra22. Talk to me if ya want. If ya don't, that's fine, you're probably not worthy to talk to someone of my calibur anyway.

      Starting today, I am going to try and complete one of my goals for this summer. I am going to play video games, and my computer for 72 straight hours. I probably won't post on here for some time, so if ya get worried, just think about all the good times we shared together.

      Since I didn't get a chance to blog recently, I figured that I should now. Yesterday I went out with Jessica. We saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It was pretty good. I then played DDR against a senior I know. I only lost by 50000 points. We then went bowling. I am a terrible bowler. I only won by 7 points, and I only had 72. We then went out for pizza and ice cream. I twisted my ankle walking across the street, and it still hurts. Unfotunately, I had to work today. It was really easy, but it was, as usual, pretty boring, especially when I have Alyce's Xbox here waiting for me. I guess that's all I got, so I'll leave all y'all alone for the day. See you, space samurai.

      I finish having my girlfriend over, and she goes home. I try to call her, but her phone is dead. She gets on MSN and tells me that her parents have been phone shopping for 3 hours. Her mom then walks in, and Jessi tells me they found a house in town. Her dad can drop us off at the movies tomorrow, and we can still go on our date. Everything turned out right, which is kinda freakin' me out. Nothing normally turns out right. But, on the bright side, I kicked ass on Halo today. Juggernaut mode, I won 10-6.

      I got paid today! Yay! I bought myself the following: One pizza, large; One Xbox controller S Blue; One Xbox Memory Card. Jessi also came over today, and we played Halo for awhile. I know I should have held back for her, but I won by... a lot. I also played Morrowind for a few hours, and got killed quite a bit. My character I'm using now is called Ferric. He's a custom class, based on all weaponry. Unfortunately, I recently got expelled from the Thieves' Guild. My mood seems to have improved from earlier. I talked to Stephie, and she seemed happier, so I suppose I have nothing to worry about. May you all walk on warm sands!

      It's the 3rd of June now. That means that Jessica and I have been going out for 7 months now. Also, I get payed today. Two more Xbox accesories for me! Well, after yesterday's post, that kinda wraps things up for me. I'll write more when I'm feeling better.

      It's not that there is anything physically wrong with me, I just haven't felt like myself lately. I do have quite a bit going on in my life, but it can't be that, I'd be able to tell if it were that. I think it is due to the way I've been treating my best friend, Stephie. I haven't called her but once the whole break, and I hardly have time to talk to her. I just can't manage to do everything anymore. I know she should be the first priority I have, and she's not. I'm not really sure what is. Everyone around me seems to get more depressed as they progress in years. No one is happy anymore, and I can't do anything about it. It always causes me great mental anguish when others are feeling emotional pain, and I can't aid them. I feel very connected to all my friends, and when they feel sad, I feel twice as bad for them. This depression is killing me. I have to do something about it. There must be a way to at least make everyone a little happier, even for a few seconds. I would give anything to see that.

      As usual for the first few weeks of summer vacation, I have found something to do that keeps me up into the wee hours of the morning. As I was doing earlier, I read the fifth Harry Potter book. I've just stumbled onto chapter nineteen-ish before sitting down on my bed to use the computer once again. This blog is kinda fun. It's like having a one-sided conversation with my trusty monitor, except everyone else can read it. I have to remember not to give away any hints for D&D (Dungeons & Dragons). The MP system I have been working is coming along nicely, with a little help from some Mages I have come to know as my clansmen. Spellmaking is fun! Oooh....  shiny .... Wow, only 3 a.m. and I am already showing signs of fatigue. I really have lost my touch. However, I will not give up. My goal is not a lofty one. I will remain awake until I receive my paycheck, at which point I will probably collapse in the lobby. Anyway, I should probably get back to work on my MP system for the next time my group meets, probably 2 weeks from sunday, if I can manage that day...wait, nope, can't do it then either. Darn Father's day... Oh well, at least there are only 20 days until my birthday! Woo hoo!

      Just like the title says, I've been reduced to doing something I hardly ever do in my spare time. I'm reading a new book. I know, it is not at all what my profile says I would do, but it has given me a new motto besides "destroyer of the Halo." I am now James Lucas, "Toujours Pur." If anyone knows what that means, I congratulate them on their knowledge of basic French. I just finished my first year of French a couple of weeks ago, and I can barely say anything, but I can read a lot of it. Anyway, I finally got around to reading the fifth Harry Potter book, and I know I'm a little behind, but I've had a lot of stuff to do lately, so I havent had time to do simple things like reading, or research for D&D. Fortunately, a new influence has given me some new inovations for the big quest coming up. To anyone interested, I have created a new enchantment system, and the ability to create spells based on your current spell knowledge, and also one can now buy spells from other people. If I work it out right, I can also reduce or completely remove the Spell Level system for a more RPG-like MP system. Of course, to balance things, each spell will have to have a percent-failure chance.... wow... I haven't gotten to talk about anything like that for awhile, and I guess I got carried away. I think that's all I got ta say today, and if it's not, I'll post more later. Oh yeah! I almost forgot! Since it is June, I'll be putting up a countdown to my birthday. 21 more days!

      I have been extremely busy lately. My boss found out i'm 16, and now i'm workin 40 hours a week. Of course, because of my large amount of experiance, they are putting me on open shift. I work most days, including weekends, from 5 am - 1 pm. I have a couple of days off, so I might be doing some work with my dad to finish moving some things from storage, among other things. I still won't be able to talk to most of you for a while, but I will try as hard as I can to keep in touch wit'cha. P.S.- Me and Alyce made section leaders of the Trombones! Yay for us!

As of this time, the totals stand as follows: (users in alphabetical order) Aeri87: 350 coal, 11.7% Chaobreeder: 790 coal, 26.3% Freya 55: 124 coal, 4.1% Hydra22: 952 coal, 31.7%  Totals: 2216 coal, 73.9%

      Ok I currently have 57 coal in the bank and that is not including what I gave you earlier. I am once again lost in the world so as soon as someone can please help. I'll wonder aimlessly until someone helps or I find the coal site. Then I'll be okay, and by the way, the one time I spammed was I state a one time event. I don't plan on ever doing it again unless someone makes me angry. Which we all know is not very hard to do because I have a short fuse so don't mess with me. That is all. Freya out. :)

      OK everyone, here's the basics. 1)  No spamming.  Once, on a forum, a member of a certain group I am involved with spammed. It was very annoying. Don't do it again *cough* Alyce *cough*. 2)  No foul language unless completely justified.  If you don't think it is 93.2% neccesary, don't use it. 3)  Post at least once on here every 2 weeks or get a pay cut.  4) When I post my Ore Count post (every 6 hrs.) post on the comments with your total. If you do not post on at least one of the Ore Counts per day, our orders may go out late.  When orders go out late, everyone gets a pay cut (myself included.) To accomodate this pay cut, I will spend the 5% cut on coal for the next orders. Please post on here with something to say or ask about. Note: If there are no outstanding orders, the clan can mine coal for a certain member's order. In other words, if you want coal, and we aren't working, just post and it will be done, free of charge.

        Since I thought it would be a good idea to post the news on here, I started with the latest news. We can put our own thoughts on the comments, so if you think this news/update is unfair or otherwise stupid, or you would like to inquire as to what they were smoking when they came up with this stuff, go right on ahead and put up a comment! I'll be doing this everytime a new news post comes out. PS: I would like to take this opportunity to remind the rest of you to try to get members. It is very cheap and very much worth the price. Since Aaron mainly lacks in the members only skills, that would be the easiest way to kick his ass in something.        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    27th July 2004 - Agility, Potions and Parties!      Brimhaven Agility Arena    The enterprising Cap'n Izzy No-Beard invites you to the Brimhaven Agility Arena, entry is only 200 gp! The entrance is the bamboo hut in the north-east part of Brimhaven.  The Agility Arena is a huge cavern of platforms connected by traps and obstacles. There are many different routes to get around the agility arena, you are much more likely to fail the obstacles on some routes than on others, some ways can not even be taken until you reach a certJustain agility level.   One platform is marked by a flashing arrow, try and make your way to it. Every minute a different platform will become the one with the flashing arrow instead. If you tag more than one pillar in a row then you will receive a ticket. You won't get a ticket at the first pillar but you will for every pillar you tag after that. If you miss a pillar then you will miss out on the next ticket so try and get as many as you can! You can save up these tickets and trade them in for more agility experience or for some items which you can't get anywhere else.  There is no agility requirement but players with low agility will find it difficult to get any tickets. As your agility level increases and you can take more routes through the arena and you start to fail the traps and obstacles less you will begin to get significantly more tickets.   There be booty to be got, ye landlocked landlubbers!    New Potions    2 of the things you can get from your agilty arena tickets are new herbs - Toadflax and Snapdragon. These are the potions associated with those herbs.   Herblore level 34: Toadflax + Toads' Legs = Agility Potion Effect: Raises agility level by 3 Herblore level 63: Snapdragon + Red Spiders' Eggs = Super Restore Potion Effect: Restores stats including some prayer   Party Room changes    Party pete will now periodically clear worthless junk from the drop chest. He will leave anything which he thinks has some value. If there are lots of items in the chest, you now get a greater chance of getting something in a balloon. It is also now cheaper to pull the lever or get the knights to dance.

       Right now, I am trying to get all of my skills above level 40. It's going well, but the hard ones seem to be hard only because they are very boring. I know most people found mining boring, but I didn't. Now that Aaron is gone, we might have to   work a bit harder. He has surpassed my total skill level. His stats can be found at the bottom of this post. I would like all of us to have at least one skill above one of his. I do have my skill done. My mining is still higher than his (unless he got a few hundred thousand xp in the past day.) Anyway, here are his skills.     &nbsp;   Total Skill: 952    Attack: 67    Defence: 66    Strength: 67    HP: 67    Ranged: 52    Prayer: 49    Magic: 45    Cooking: 57    Woodcutting: 53    Fletching: 33    Fishing: 55    Firemaking: 54    Crafting: 50    Smithing: 49    Mining: 71    Agility: 36    Thieving: 34    *Any skills not shown are not above level 30.    If you have surpassed any of these,  please  put a comment on here. Thank you!

      On the grounds of being lazy, complaining about the light work load, and insubordination, Chaobreeder is removed from the Metal Lords. He is to be blocked from all clan friends lists, and not to be talked to in any way. His clan is now our main rival, and anyone in his clan is not to buy our resources.

      If anyone wants to go the full mile and help me get the ability to smith rune plates, (worth 85k for only 69.8k of materials) I will need the following materials: NOTE: you are not in any way obligated to do this order.  637,248 Coal 159,312 Mithril ore  ~OR~  22,416 + 144,060 + 625,656 Coal 5,604 Mithril 24,010 Adamantite 78,207 Runite  I will pay anyone who helps 1.5 million gp as soon as I get it, which, if we can mine these things, won't take long. If you all help, you all get payed. Your name will be chosen at random to determine order.

      I would like to place an order at this point. After we finish the final coal order, and since the man ordering silver has yet to contact me again, I myself would like to use our services. I will pay all of you very well, especially since this order will allow me to make a very valuable prize: Adamant (addy) bars. With this, I can make Addy daggers, which sell for almost 800 gp a piece. Therefore, for every 700gp worth of coal, we make more than 800 gp. Nothin' but profit. I can provide all of my own addy for now, but you will all soon be able to help me. According to the high scores listings, if you all gather 1/3 of both materials, your levels will increase as follows:  Aeri87: 212295 (Lv. 57) -> 735335 (Lv. 69) Chaobreeder: 756227 (Lv. 70) -> 1279267 (Lv. 75) Freya 55: 123400 (Lv. 51) -> 646400 (Lv. 68)  Note: Isn't it odd that the same amount of XP can raise one player 17 whole lvls and another only 5?  My order is as follows: 22,416 coal, 5,604 mithril. Thanks for helping if you feel like it, and if you don't, that's fine, tell me and I can give you increased XP values depending on how many of us quit. As an incentive, I will be paying based on a ratio of materials to time. Whosoever get the most materials in the least time gets paid in the least time. Who ever comes in second will be paid second, and so forth.

      Now that we have all returned, hopefully we can finish the new coal order in record time. We have already acquired.... umm.... *looks up new total on excel spreadsheet on laptop* 1265 coal, which is alright for a start, but we should have at least 3.5k by the end of Sunday. That's our goal, 3.5k coal by the end of tomorrow. I'll be working, will you?   Bonus: I sold the 5k coal to the second guy. Current payment for each member on this order: 210k

      Hey guys. I am totally back from camp. It sucked! The showers were home to many large insects and arachnids and the water pressure was very poor. The light rain we received had more pressure than our showers at the camp known as Tambo. Anyways I am ready to hit the mining again so tell me what to do. Freya out.

      Ok Ok I know that this is a runescape clan blog I should talk about clan stuff like ore totals and stuff right? Yeah I'll eventually get to that but this time I want to apologize again for..yeah you guessed it. I didn't show up when I was supposed to again. Plus I had a bad day at work and knowing that Jimmy may be mad at me has put me into a bad mood. Oh yeah I thought I should at least put one runescape related thing in here so I'll let the others know how much coal I have.  Coal ore count for Aeri : 179 coal  Yeah yeah I know it's not much..but I'm working on it, and I'll be sure to get on runescape tomorow. Adios people...  P.S.  Best of luck to Jimmy tomorow on his driving test!

      I wanted to apologize to all my fellow clan members for not being here tonight whenever we needed coal. Aunt Lucy needed the computer and before I could get back on andrew had me play some magic the gathering and that lasted about 3 hours... I currently have 61 coal and working on getting more. Thats all for this post  P.S.  OME! The 2nd episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force was so funny!

       New World Map     Today we have released a superb replacement for our exisiting world map in the form of an applet. With the new applet you can scroll around and zoom in and out with ease. The applet also contains all the new areas that have been discovered in RuneScape, including Mort Myre Swamp and Death Plateau! Saving the best to last, clicking items in the key highlights their placement on the map - helping you locate all sorts of useful places much faster.   Death Plateau Quest     Trolls have come down from the north and are camped on Death Plateau, they are using this base to launch attacks on the principality of Burthorpe! The Imperial Guard is taking heavy losses, they need your help!  If you are in search of adventure speak to Denulth, the leader of the Imperial Guard, in the Burthorpe training camp north of the Hero's Guild and accept the Death Plateau quest!  While this is a quest completable at any level, players with a low combat level should be very cautious or they could come to a sudden and sticky end at the hands of trolls.  This update introduces the town of Burthorpe and a troll area, which is an area that we have plans to expand in future updates with some quests classed in the experienced quests bracket.  We have made some adjustments to the agility arena. More than one person can now go over the low wall at once and it doesn't take as long to use the handholds.  Some colourblind people were struggling with the new strange boxes due to them being fairly transparent, therefore they are now no longer transparent.

      Today regular visitors to our website might notice that we have massively overhauled the front page! We know some of you might be used to our old layout, but we think that once you are used to the new design you will agree that it is easier to navigate. We have tried to make the front-page make better use of the available screen space, as well as making the most accessed areas (for example the worldmap) easier and quicker to get to.  The layout of the manual has also been improved, and lots of new information has been added, including a few new sections for you to discover yourselves!  You will also be glad to know we have added an all new exclusive wallpaper to our extra files section, which has moved towards the bottom of the main menu.  Finally, Mozilla Firefox 0.9 users will be pleased to know that we have improved compatibility with that browser, so you will now be able to login to the secure section of the site with less hassle than before.

      We have had to move worlds 19,20,21 and 25 to a different location, because the company that was providing bandwidth for them previously has suddenly ceased trading. This meant we had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  So we could get them up and running again as quickly as possible, those worlds have now been moved to one of our other existing providers.  Their new home is 'nlayer'. We already had a few worlds there and were very happy with their reliability/performance, so in fact the relocated worlds should hopefully run faster than ever at their new location.  All the worlds should now be functioning normally again.  *Taken from  urlLink www.runescape.com

      We've had to temporarily take our CET worlds offline to move them to a new bandwidth provider.  Unfortunately our old bandwidth provider for those worlds has suddenly ceased trading, and so we've had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  The worlds are being moved across now, to a different cabinet in the same building, and should hopefully be back up in a few hours time.  Meanwhile you can keep playing anyway, please just use another world, and I'll post again as soon as they are back.  Thanks Andrew  *Taken From  urlLink www.runescape.com   This does indeed suck.
