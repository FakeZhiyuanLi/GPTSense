      NHS Direct - self-help guide Sinusitis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Although inflammation and infection of the hollow spaces of the face bones is extremely painful, it is rarely serious. Some people suffer from repeated sinusitis while others avoid the problem altogether. We do not know why. Many people develop sinus congestion with a cold, but this rarely develops into a bacterial infection.  Symptoms The way sinusitis affects you depends upon which of your sinuses - the hollow bone cavities - is affected. It can feel like severe toothache or like a headache with tenderness under the eyebrows. Generally, your nose feels blocked up and your voice has a nasal sound. It can last for weeks but most will clear up within 7 days.  Causes We know that the sinuses fail to drain though their ducts into the back of the nose and that it often follows a cold or allergic attack, but we don't really know why.  Complications Serious complications such as infection spreading into the bone are now very rare.  Self care Pain relief is important. Take aspirin (not for children under 16 years), paracetamol or ibuprofen.  Decongestants may help initially but their overuse simply makes matters worse, particularly when you stop taking them.  Sniffing very hard, though not sounding very pleasant, can be very effective at clearing the mucus from the sinuses.  Sometimes, lying with your head over the end of the bed so it is lower than your shoulders and then sniffing hard can be effective.  Stop smoking.  Try inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water or try menthol inhalations.  Your doctor may prescribe you antibiotics but they penetrate the sinuses very slowly and you need to take them in high doses for quite a while. There are surgical treatments to flush out the sinuses, which were very common but are now only rarely performed.

      1) The main symptom of sinusitis is pain and the location of the pain depends on which sinus is affected.  • Maxillary sinuses – affection of the maxillary sinuses causes an ache in the upper jaw(maxilla) and teeth. The cheeks become to tender to light pressure or even touch. • Frontal sinuses – when the forehead is touched or lightly pressed, and pain is induced, the cause is likely to be frontal sinusitis. • Sphenoid sinuses – infections not common but can present as ear-aches, neck pain and sometimes deep aching in the head. • Ethmoid sinuses – these sinuses are located between the eyes and cause swelling of the eyelids and surrounding tissue as well as causing a pain between the eyes. There can also be anosmia (loss of smell) and tenderness when the sides of the nose are palpated.  Having stated this, the majority of sinus infections involve more than one cavity, and pain is found in several spots-  2) Head pain on waking in the morning  3) A low grade fever between 99F and 100F  4) Weakness or tiredness  5) A cough that is more prevalent at night  6) A runny nose (rhinitis)   7) Nasal congestion  8) Halitosis (bad breath)  9) Eyes are sensitive to light  10) Eye lids swell Types of sinusitis  We classify sinusitis as acute, chronic and recurrent  • Acute Sinusitis  Acute sinusitis last for 2-3 weeks or less. This is usually after a viral infection which causes swelling of the sinus membranes, as a result one or more of your sinuses may become blocked. Bacteria that normally resides within the cavity starts to multiply and cause an infection. It commonly follows a typical "cold". It the cold symptoms last much more than one week, then the cold may have advanced into a sinus infection. If you have frequent episodes of acute sinusitis, or if your symptoms never completely go away, you may have chronic sinusitis.   • Chronic Sinusitis People who have asthma or allergic disorders are prone to chronic sinusitis. Any condition that causes a weakened immune system or that causes chronic inflammation to the nasal mucosa can result in chronic sinusitis. Allergies or bacterial infection also play a major role in chronic sinusitis by producing inflammation in the sinus membranes. Chronic sinusitis is one of the most common chronic illnesses in Americans under the age of 45. About 20% of patients with chronic sinusitis develop nasal polyps. Nasal polyps are cyst-like growths that develop from sinus tissue. The resulting growth can causes the sinus cavities to become blocked.  • Recurrent Sinusitis When one gets several separate attacks in one year.  We at SinusWars have further grouped these three types of remedies into 10 distinct groups and have made up remedies to help relieve your type of sinus.   Our remedies treat all types of Acute, Chronic, and recurrent sinusitis. SITE MAP  	SinusWars Home Page

      Question: Tell me about nasal lavage or nasal saline spray.  Answer: Daily frequent use of saline nasal spray or irrigation is recommended to cleanse thick secretions from the nose and sinuses. This simple economical treatment is effective but is unfortunately underused.   Saline nasal spray is available over-the-counter as sterile physiologic saline solution in spray bottles. Alternatively, saline solution may be prepared at home with 1/4 tsp of salt dissolved in 8oz of tap water. A pinch of baking soda may be added. The patient should place the solution in a spray bottle or ear bulb syringe for lavage. Two to four puffs of nasal saline spray should be administered at least three times a day. The alternative more aggressive method is lavage with a bulb syringe while leaning over the sink with the mouth open. Repeated full syringe wash and aspiration is recommended at least three times daily to wash out the secretions if they cannot be effectively removed with saline spray alone.   Not every patient wishes to perform nasal lavage, but some find it the most important treatment of all!   Question: Tell me more about NASAL IRRIGATIONS.  Answer: The nasal and sinus cavities are normally able to clear mucus on their own through "mucociliary transport." Up to one quart of mucus is produced daily and is swallowed. Sometimes swelling of the nose from either allergy, irritation, or infection can prevent this self-cleaning. In these cases, irrigations (nasal flushing or washing) are used until the lining of the nose and sinuses can recover and revert to normal.   Irrigations may be carried out with a spray bottle, a rubber bulb syringe (like the kind used for cleaning infants' noses) or a water-pik device (set on the lowest setting). Whichever device is used, it should be sterilized on a daily basis so that bacteria are not reintroduced into the nasal cavity with each irrigation. Sterilization may be performed with a weak solution of Betadine (available in pharmacies as a douche).   Irrigation solutions can be made from saline (salt water), baking soda, and/or antibiotics. When irrigating the nose, the irrigation solution will run out the front of your nose or down the back of your throat. Although a small amount of this is not harmful if swallowed, larger amounts may produce bloating or fullness in the abdomen. It is therefore best to perform the irrigations while leaning forward over a sink so that the solution may drip or be spit out. Occasionally, we recommend adding a prescription antibiotic (usually gentamicin) to the irrigation solution to inhibit bacterial growth. Patients on a salt-restricted diet should probably avoid using salt in the irrigation fluid (i.e., saline) and may use sterile water.   Homemade preparation of irrigation:   1 pint of boiled water 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Let cool and irrigate nose with 1/4 to 1/2 cup on each side.   Question: What about steam inhalation?  Answer: In addition to irrigations, steam inhalation also has a beneficial effect on the nasal lining. Various steam-producing inhalation devices are commercially available. Room humidifiers may also provide some symptomatic improvement in some people. However, they can become a source of aerosolized mold and bacteria if they are not cleaned regularly.   Question: Tell me about humidification of air.  Answer: Humidification of inspired air and hydration are other methods recommended to clear thick secretions. In general, a cool mist humidifier, hot steamy showers, and drinking 8 full glasses of water per day are effective.   Question: Anything I should know about vaporizers?  Answer: Vaporizers must be cleaned thoroughly and frequently. While they can be helpful in conditioning air, they can harbor mold and other organisms if they are not cleaned thoroughly and frequently.   QUESTION: What is a netty pot?  Answer: A netty pot is a device of Indian origin that delivers nasal irrigation to wash out a patient's nose. Some patients find netty pot irrigations to be very soothing.

      For best results, irrigate mornings and evenings until sinus symptoms ease. A doctor-recommended recipe for nasal irrigation is a combination of 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. baking soda to 1 cup of warm water. This warm solution quickly aids irritated nose tissue and cleanses crusted mucus, debris, pollen and pollution.

      Aches and Pains Index    People commonly say that they can predict changes in the weather based on how their joints feel. Theoretically, changes in atmospheric pressure could exert an effect on the fluid in joints. Historical studies have been focused on the effects of weather changes, such as temperature and humidity, on pain. Currently medical doctors are conducting further research to determine specifically how these changes in weather may impact your body.  The aches and pains index map uses factors such as precipitation, high relative humidity, brisk winds, and those areas likely to experience large changes in surface pressure to determine the highest aches and pains index values. The map graphically depicts areas of higher and lower levels of weather-related pain, valid 24 hours after the time indicated on the map. Locations within the orange, red or pink regions can expect higher than normal levels of aches and pains. Areas coloured yellow are just above the normal levels. A scale of 0 to 10 has been devised, with 10 (pink) representing the most uncomfortable effects. Areas not coloured on the map are not expected to be affected by significant weather-related effects.

      my points here: noticed that the humidity here is 91 percent today, and that i suffer much more when humidity is high, and it's warm. or hot. i was terrible in tenerife, and it was, according to the pilot telling us about the weather as we landed, 100 percent humidity there. i had so mcuh trouble breathing.  same in NJ in the summer. it got so humid there, and those were the worst times for breathing and "allergy type" symptoms.  yet, no where around these sites does anyone mention the impact of humidity on health, or breathing, on alllergies, etc.  must be more pollution hanging around.  yet, the map shows that it's okey dokey here, as far as air stagnation goes.  i say bollocks. the air is hanging around and is very heavy, and i'm very susceptible to that, but even people that aren't usually are complaining. but if you looked at those maps, they'd all be like well the pollen risk thing is 3, that's low, the air stagnation is like non existent in wales area today on their maps. the pollen they monitor is grass only. can't find trees, or weed pollen counts that work.  not mould spores, nor fungi spore, or fern spores. and i saw lots of those ferns in the woods at the weekend.  so what are they going to do call me a liar?

      Breathing / Respiratory  Find out how the weather conditions in your area will impact your respiratory system. Not only could you be sensitive to sudden changes in temperature, but also the lack of air movement will help pollutants stick around and create adverse effects on your health.  Air Stagnation Index  Be aware that fair weather can sometimes create conditions for pollutants to stay in your area. Find out how the air stagnation index is used to determine these conditions.  Respiratory Index  Even if your area is not subject to pollution, the risk of respiratory problems can be increased by sudden changes in weather or extreme temperatures. Our respiratory index determines where these conditions can be found.   Air Stagnation / Respiratory Maps Use our air stagnation and respiratory index maps to identify the areas where you are more likely to experience respiratory problems.

      Air Stagnation Index    The concentration of pollutants due to air stagnation is thought to be one of the leading causes of respiratory problems, as found through several research studies. Air characterised by poor ventilation due to little movement of air is often defined as being stagnant. As pollution is emitted in areas where meteorological conditions are conducive to stagnation, the concentration of pollutant particles begins to increase causing the air to become unhealthy. An air stagnation index has been developed to highlight these stagnant areas.  Harmful pollutants are commonly emitted from sources such as factories, refineries, power plants, automobiles, and by-products we use. These areas are more likely to have the highest risk to your health during air stagnation episodes.  This map of the United Kingdom shows the most important sources of these emissions. Areas shaded in yellow indicate low emission levels, areas shaded in orange indicate moderate emission levels, and areas shaded in red indicate high emission levels.

      Pollen Forecast The pollen forecast shows the level of pollen expected for the region in which the selected location is found. An index from 1 to 10 is shown indicating the pollen forecast for that region for each pollen type that is reporting. The forecast index is used to represent a daily average of the pollen counts in grains per cubic metre of air. The index ranges are low (1 - 3) coloured in green, moderate (4 - 5) coloured in yellow, high (6 - 7) coloured in orange, and very high (8 - 10) coloured in red. Low is associated with a pollen count up to 30 grains, moderate is associated with a count between 31 and 50 grains, high is associated with a count between 51 and 150 grains, and very high is associated with a count greater than 150 grains. The pollen forecast is valid for the day indicated and is updated on a daily basis.   http://uk.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/weather/tenday/UKXX0512?x=15&y=8

      What is phenology Phenology is the study of the times of recurring natural phenomena especially in relation to climate change. It is recording when you heard the first cuckoo or saw the blackthorn blossom. This can then be compared with other records. Records from the past  In Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Robert Marsham was Britain's first phenologist and started recording his 'Indications of Spring' as early as 1736.The first individual records that we have found so far are from a Weather Diary from Egioke (near Redditch) from March 1703.  Development in British phenology  In 1875 British phenology took a major leap forward when the Royal Meteorological Society established a national recorder network. Annual reports were published up until 1948.  Aware of the vital importance of continuous records, Tim Sparks, research biologist at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Cambridge, started a pilot scheme in 1998 to revive a phenology network in the UK that would be both compatible with historic records and current international schemes.  In autumn 2000 the Woodland Trust forces joined with the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology to promote phenology to a far wider and larger audience. Over 15,000 people across the UK are now actively involved with the UK Phenology Network, around half of them online.   from woodland trust www.phenology.co.uk

      Helpful hayfever hints:  *	Hayfever is one of the commonest allergies in UK, affecting about 12 million people; *	In general terms, the area with the highest hayfever rate is the English midlands; *	Hayfever used to be called rose fever because people associated it with smelling roses – which flowered at the same time as grasses; *	The pollen count is a measure of the number of pollen grains of a certain type per cubic metre of air sampled, averaged over 24 hours; *	Hayfever is a modern disease. It was virtually unknown before 1800 and has become common only during the last century. The first case to be described medically was in 1819 but the causes of the disease were not identified until 1873; *	There is no fever associated with hayfever; and *	There are 33 pollen monitoring sites in the UK network. Sites report pollen counts daily through the grass pollen season and weekly through the spring and autumn.   Phenology recorders also monitor a wide range of other spring events such as the first call of the cuckoo, tree leaf buds bursting, birds nesting and the first appearance of newts, frogspawn, butterflies and bees.    A simple recording form is available from the Woodland Trust on 0800 083 7497 or by logging on to www.phenology.org.uk With over 18,000 registered recorders, the phenology survey, run by the Woodland Trust and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, is the largest of its kind in the world.

      Woodland Trust supporter, Met Office senior broadcast meteorologist, Michael Fish, says: “Higher temperatures are extending the grass flowering season. Like me, many more people will be condemned to longer bouts of sneezing, itchy eyes, headaches and a throbbing nose. Information collected by amateur phenologists throughout the UK – who record naturally occurring seasonal events in gardens, parks, woods and high streets – will help to forecast the start of the pollen season, so please become a phenology recorder.”    Professor Jean Emberlin of the National Pollen Research Unit explains: “Last year the grass pollen season was exceptionally long because it was wet and warm. The season extended into August, instead of ending in July. Generally, hayfever is affecting more and more people. Numbers have risen since 1965 when between 10 to 12 per cent of the UK population were affected, to today’s figure of 15 to 25 per cent in the population as a whole. Whilst grass pollen is the commonest trigger, birch pollen is important too. The birch pollen season has been occurring five to ten days earlier per decade over the last 30 years. By letting us know when you see trees and grasses beginning to flower, it will give us information about flowering times in advance of pollen release and it will help us to improve forecasting the start of pollen seasons. This will help you to take your medication at the right time.”    Phenology statistics comparing grass flowering dates between 2002 and 2001 show that for the UK as a whole, cocksfoot flowered nine days earlier; meadow foxtail 13 days earlier and Yorkshire fog nine days earlier.

      Climate change has suddenly become very personal. If you think it has nothing to do with you, think again. The latest findings from the world’s largest phenological recording survey1 show that this spring, you’re likely to hear the sounds of sneezing, coughing and nose blowing instead of more traditional heralds of the season, such as calling cuckoos and bleating lambs. If you don’t already know someone who suffers from the hell of hayfever, you soon will.   This is because, in response to global warming, many flowers (which includes tree and grass flowers) are flowering earlier and for longer, therefore releasing pollen for longer periods than before; and 95 per cent of hayfever is triggered by grass pollen. It is compounded by the fact that, according to the Woodland Trust, the UK's leading woodland conservation charity, in some parts of the country mowing the lawn has become a constant year-long chore. Although cut grass is usually too short to flower, sap allergens released by cut grass add to our woes. This spring, the Trust and the National Pollen Research Unit are asking people to record the early flowering grasses such as Yorkshire fog, cocksfoot, meadow foxtail and Timothy grass, as part of the UK Phenology Network’s1 survey, which is monitoring the timing of Nature’s events in a changing environment.

      "The  European Pollen information network has pollen count data for many countries over the last few decades. Analysis of these records show that  pollen seasons  for many types of  allergenic plant are  starting earlier and lasting longer due to recent weather changes which may be linked to global warming. The prolongation of the pollination period has led to  an increase in the time when hay fever  sufferers may have symptoms.  Pollen allergens can interact with pollution particles such that their antigenic potency is increased. In addition synergistic effects of pollen and air pollution  can lead to an  increase in symptom severity.

      How can I make breathing easier?   These techniques can help your lungs work more effectively and help you relax when you feel short of breath.    Breathe with the stomach    *	Place one hand on your chest. This hand should remain still when you breathe.   *	Place the other hand on your stomach with your thumb on your belly button. This hand should rise up and down when you breathe    *	Breathe in through your nose as you count to three. Breathe out as you count to six.    *	Repeat this for approximately 15 minutes.    *	Practice this as often as possible - learning to coordinate stomach movements and breathing takes time. You can breathe with the stomach while you are sitting, standing or lying down.      Tight-lipped breathing technique    *	Breathe in slowly through your nose.   *	Tighten your lips a little. Now breathe out slowly with a soft, hissing sound.    *	Try combining tight-lipped breathing with the stomach breathing.

      Often sinusitis can be treated with home treatments. Rest, breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water, and over-the-counter medicines should help. Ask a pharmacist for advice.  Ibuprofen or paracetamol help to relieve pain and lower temperature. Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (tablets or linctus, e.g Sudafed tablets), and menthol, which can be inhaled, reduce the swelling in the nose and allow the sinuses to drain. Decongestants should not be used for more than a week, as prolonged use can actually make nasal blockage worse in the long run.  Consult a GP if symptoms don’t improve after a week of trying home remedies. The GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics.  Chronic sinusitis  Steroid nasal sprays such as beclometasone (eg Beconase), available from pharmacists and on prescription, are helpful in two ways. If long–term infection is present they help to reduce swelling of the nasal lining and open up the drainage holes, and if allergy is involved they also reduce inflammation. Antihistamines such as loratidine (eg Clarityn) might also help.  In severe cases, the GP may recommend a short course of steroid tablets. These are only available on prescription.  Endoscopic nasal surgery may be needed as a last resort. Tubes and instruments passed down a nasal endoscope are used to wash out the sinus and widen the drainage hole. This can be done under general or local anaesthetic. It is a routine and generally safe procedure, but all surgery does carry some element of risk. Complications include minor damage to the lining of the nose or sinuses, or damage to the skull bone.  Other types of surgery sometimes required to treat chronic sinusitis include correcting a bent nasal cartilage (septoplasty) or removing nasal polyps.  Prevention  It is possible to reduce the chances of developing sinusitis. Here are some things that might be helpful, especially for people who are prone to sinusitis:   *	keeping the air humid at home, *	using an air-filtering vacuum cleaner, *	removing pets, *	having a course of anti-allergy injections, *	stopping smoking, *	drinking less alcohol, *	using a decongestant spray or tablets before diving or swimming.

      What causes sinusitis?  Most cold viruses only result in a blocked nose. However, if the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages and sinuses swells up, this can block mucus drainage. Mucus builds up causing the pressure and pain of sinusitis. Bacteria or fungi are more likely to grow in sinuses that can’t drain properly, and bacterial infection often causes more inflammation and pain.   Chronic sinusitis is caused by anything that irritates the lining of the nose over long periods and causes the mucous membrane to swell. Examples include:   *	grass and tree pollen, *	cold air, *	alcohol, *	perfumes, *	damp weather, *	allergy to house dust mite, mould,and fungi, *	chronic drug use ("snorting").    People who have allergy-based asthma often have sinusitis as well. Indeed, any problem with the nose that blocks the drainage holes can produce sinusitis. This can include polyps (small nodules of mucous membrane), and injury that causes the bridge to lean to one side (deviated nasal septum).  Tooth and gum infections can spread to the sinuses. Rarer causes of sinusitis include conditions that weaken the immune system such as HIV and cystic fibrosis. Swimming, air pollution and smoking can aggravate sinusitis.

      What causes mould allergy? It is not the mould itself but the mould spores that cause allergic reactions. Mould spores are believed to be present in the air at greater quantities than any other substance. These tiny invisible spores are produced by moulds and fungi in large quantities. Spores are the mould's system of reproduction. Moulds and fungi release their spores into the air to be carried towards other sources of food. Moulds do not produce chloroform and therefore need to live off other matter. They thrive on any decaying substance, fallen leaves, fruit, grass, soil and plants. Indoors they can live on any decaying matter and can grow in carpets, old furniture, on walls, in cupboards and on wood. They will live anywhere where there is enough moisture to support them and of course the British climate is ideal for their proliferation.   What prompts the mould to release its spores? Mould spores are often released when there is a change in the environment, when moist conditions suddenly become warm, when the central heating first goes on in a damp house, or when plants or Christmas trees are brought into a warmer interior. "Using a tumble drier, ironing clothes, drying wet towels or hanging wet laundry near a strong heat source will stimulate spore production." Outdoor mould spores are often more prolific in late summer and autumn, during the harvest time and as fallen leaves collect on the ground. There is often a proliferation of mould after the first frost or during the spring thaw in colder countries. People who suffer from mould allergies are sometimes also sensitive to mushrooms, cheese, dried fruits etc because of their high mould content.   en released when there is a change in the environment, when moist conditions suddenly become warm, when the central heating first goes on in a damp house, or when plants or Christmas trees are brought into a warmer interior.

      The most common allergens are: pollen from trees and grasses, house dust mite, moulds, pets such as cats and dogs, insects like wasps and bees, industrial and household chemicals, medicines, and foods such as milk and eggs. Less common allergens include nuts, fruit and latex.  There are some non-protein allergens which include drugs such as penicillin. For these to cause an allergic response they need to be bound to a protein once they are in the body.

      Teddies/Soft Toys:- Keep toys that are not in current use away in a toy chest or cupboard. Soft toys should be washed with non-bio washing powder/liquid or washing powder/liquid suitable for sensitive skin at over 56 degrees or put in the freezer for 3-4 hours and then washed at a lower temperature. Once washed and dried store in a plastic bag out of reach of children. With a favourite toy make sure that it is washed as above on a weekly basis. This avoids the housedust mite building up. Do not have soft toys sitting on the bed.

      Car:- Vacuum the fabric seats regularly. Choose a car with good pollen filtration. Choose a car with least amount of latex and nickel. Check for certification of 'allergy friendly' interior. If buying a car with the 'new car' chemical smell. Leave in the sun with the windows open. Wipe down the interior of the car with a non perfumed cleaner. Do not use air fresheners.

      1. Clothes lines:- If you are a hayfever sufferer make sure that you do not dry your clothes outside during high pollen times especially early morning and early evening.  2. Feeding your Garden:- Compost should be kept covered to reduce mould spores. Use low allergen mulch instead of compost.  3. Grass:- Consider replacing grass with pebble/shingle or decking. Another alternative to grass is the artificial turf used on tennis courts/football field. If keeping grass, cut the lawn often and keep it short to prevent it producing flowers. Do not use a strimmer as these can cause sap to fly up onto the skin. Do not leave grass cuttings on the lawn.  4. Low growing green plants:- Avoid privet hedging. Avoid using ferns in the garden as the spores can affect people.  5. Flowers:- Avoid plants with hairy stems or leaves i.e. Geranium, Iris, Clematis Plant low allergen plants such as non -scented honeysuckle. Rose, lavateria, Mahonia, Cotoneaster, Rhododendron, Skimmia, Spirea, Syringa, Ribes.  6. Fence:- Wood preservatives can cause a range of problems for people with allergies. Use water based wood preservatives but treat these with respect also.

      1. Fire:- Consider replacing open fires with imitation coal electric fires that do not have hard to clean features. Make sure that your chimney is working properly. Smokeless fuel is better than coal which may produce high levels of sulphur dioxide, avoid gas fires. Wipe surfaces with a damp cloth regularly.  2. Plants:- If you like plants in the house cover the soil in the plant pot with pea-shingle as this will stop mould settling and forming. Consider having a spider plant as this reduces formaldehyde.  3. Soft Furnishings:- Settee Vacuum fabric covered upholstered furniture regularly - at least every couple of weeks and wash covers regularly at 60 degrees. When vacuuming it is important to do so with a vacuum cleaner that has high 'hepa' filtration and does not allow any of the allergen to escape from the exhaust. A good guide is if it holds the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. This means that it has been tested extensively against a very high protocol in a laboratory. Consider using anti allergy covering under top covering. If replacing a suite opt for leather as the house dust mite cannot live there. Try and keep pets off the furniture. Cat allergen is particularly difficult for people with allergy as it stays airborne longer and is generally found over a wider area of the home. Cushions:- House dust mite are just as comfortable in the soft cushions as they are living in the carpets.  Click here for products awarded our Seal of Approval, to help you have an allergy friendly house.   4. Coffee Table:- Avoid clutter and too many ornaments. Wipe surfaces with a damp cloth. If flowers are desired in the room choose the type of flower with great care and opt for flowers such as lilies. The stamens which arise from the middle of the bloom should be removed carefully as the flower opens by a non-allergic person. This will remove the pollen. Board based furniture (MDF or chipboard) should be aired before use to reduce levels of formaldehyde.  5. Mat / Carpet:- Vacuum daily. When vacuuming it is important to do so with a vacuum cleaner that has high 'hepa' filtration and does not allow any of the allergen to escape from the exhaust. A good guide is if it holds the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. This means that it has been tested extensively against a very high protocol in a laboratory. Remember pollen can live in the carpet for up to 3 months so in the hayfever season vacuuming is just as important as in the winter. Provide the dog with its own bed preferably made/covered with an anti allergy cover such as that used in bedding. Groom pets outdoors. Wash pets frequently to remove the allergens. Wash pet beds at over 60 degrees and remember pets suffer from allergies too.  Click here for products awarded our Seal of Approval, to help you have an allergy friendly house.   6. Air cleaner:- Running the air cleaner continually as per the manufacturers instructions can assist in the reduction/removal of allergens such as house dust mite, dander and smoke.  7. Lampshade:- Have washable lampshade as fabric ones hold dust.  8. Curtains:- Wash curtains every three months at a temperature of 56 degrees or above. Consider using a roller blind instead of curtains. House dust mite are just as comfortable living in heavy curtains as they are living in the carpets.  9. Windows:- Keep room well ventilated. Wash curtains regularly at 60 degrees. Make sure that UPVC glazing units are free of mould. In the hayfever season keep windows shut where possible.  10. Pets:- Pets should be kept off of the furniture where possible. Provide the dog with its own bed preferably made/covered with an anti allergy cover such as that used in bedding. Groom pets outdoors. Wash pets frequently to remove the allergens.  11. Picture Frame:- Picture frames should be dusted regularly. Damp dusting is particularly good for people who react to dust and / or are asthmatic. Avoid using a feather duster as this can 'flick' dust in the air which will remain airborne for several hours. There are electrostatic cloths on the market and these are also good.  12. Clutter / Ornaments:- Try to keep clutter to a minimum. If you like ornaments try and keep them in a glass cabinet to reduce the surface area that dust can cling to and to make it easier and quicker to 'damp' dust. Damp dusting is particularly good for people who react to dust and / or are asthmatic. Avoid using a feather duster as this can 'flick' dust in the air which will remain airborne for several hours. There are electrostatic cloths on the market and these are also good.  13. Wallpaper / Paint:- Don't forget that dust also sticks to the walls so make the wallpaper non-textured or able to be easily wiped. Paint is very much recommended for low allergen homes however solvents within the paint can spark off a reaction so thought has to be given. Remember the higher the VOC content the stronger the odour will be. Oil based paints are more likely to cause problems to people with allergy so water based paints and varnishes are better for allergic people as they are usually low in odour. Some people do react even to water based paint but there are allergen-friendly paints on the market from specialist suppliers.

      1. Kitchen wall cabinet:- Build wall cabinet to the ceiling to avoid dust being collected in hard to reach spots for cleaning. Wipe down kitchen cabinets every 2/3 months. Choose easy to wipe fronts for the cabinets.  2. Work top:- Keep food surfaces as clean as possible to prevent mould and cockroach infestation. Keep worktops as uncluttered as possible. Use water resistant grouting for tiled areas. Make sure that the grouting of the tiles is flush with the work surface to eliminate any chances of mould or food supply for cockroaches. Wipe food surfaces down after preparing food with a cloth dampened with disinfectant.  3. Clock:- Keep walls as uncluttered as possible to make cleaning easier. Choose flat smooth surfaces for the walls and use washable paint.  4. Window:- Open window to help reduce condensation and to freshen the air of the kitchen when in use. Use roller blinds or washable curtains that are easily cleaned.  5. Sink:- Make sure that there is no water leakage as this will be a source of water for cockroaches. Make sure that any strainers in the sink are emptied to eliminate a source of food for cockroaches. To clean drains make up a solution of 8floz vinegar with 3oz (75g) of baking soda. Pour directly into the drain. Leave for 10 minutes then run clean hot water down the drain to clear grease and debris.  6. Refrigerator:- Wash out refrigerator regularly to make sure that mould does not gather in the corners. Check salad draw regularly and throw away any out of date food.  7. Cooker:- Keep lids on pans to reduce condensation. Cook by electric rather than gas if asthmatic. Wipe oven clean after use. To remove cooking smells from the kitchen boil a cup of water with one tablespoon of vinegar.  8. Extractor fan:- Use extractor fan to remove excess moisture. A ducted extractor is better than a recycled one as a ducted extractor removes the excess moisture which a recycled one does not. Regularly change/clean filters over the cooker. Remember that lighting over the cooker will need cleaning more often than worktop lighting.  9. Waste bin:- Empty waste bin daily, wipe out with disinfectant, dry thoroughly.  10. Floor:- Choose an easy to clean flooring and ensure that it fits tightly around bases of the cabinets. Clean up immediately spills and food that has been dropped.

      1. Shelving:- Keep clutter to the minimum, wipe shelves regularly. Try not to use perfume sprays in a small bathroom as these can act as an irritant. Try using a quarter of a cup of white vinegar as an air freshener. Remember that the phrase 'suitable for sensitive skin' has no legal definition and does not mean that it will not cause a reaction. Try and use non-perfumed soaps or cleansing oils.  2. Loo:- Be carefully with the chemicals you use in the loo as these can irritate the respiratory system. Always wear protective gloves when cleaning the loo. If sensitive to chemicals use an equal mixture of domestic borax and vinegar to treat hard water deposits. See our Handy Hints factsheet. Avoid using perfumed sprays to sweeten the loo - opening the window is just as effective. Our Handy Hints page has some suggestions that may help.   3. Radiator/towel:- Dry towels outside or tumble dry them to avoid increasing the humidity in the bathroom.  4. Mat on Floor:- Use washable cotton rugs rather than carpet which will become damp and encourage mould and house dust mite growth.  5. Bath/shower:- Open the window as soon as possible after using the bath/shower. Try to dry the shower curtain as quickly as possible after use. If mould appears on the shower curtain or around the bath clean it with a paste of vinegar, lemon juice and borax. Apply and then rinse well. To clean tiles rub the surface with undiluted white vinegar. Leave for 15 minutes then rinse thoroughly. To clear clogged shower head - dismantle the shower head. Soak the pieces in a bowl of white vinegar for 2/3 hours. Clean off sediment with a stiff brush.  6. Plant:- If having plants in the bathroom, go for succulents or other types that require minimum watering to reduce the opportunity for mould.

      Bedroom  1. Window:- Keep room well ventilated. Have the window slightly open at night. Close window early morning and early evening in the pollen season. Air the room in the morning by opening the window wider.  2. Curtains:- Wash curtains every three months at temperature of 56 degrees or above. Consider using a roller blind instead of curtains.  3. Drawer Unit:- Keep clothes stored away in shut drawers. Wipe surfaces daily with damp cloth.  4. Flowers:- It is better not to have flowers beside the bed but if really desired then choose the type of flower with great care and opt for flowers such as lilies. The stamens which arise from the middle of the bloom should be removed carefully as the flower opens by a non-allergic person. This will remove the pollen.  5. Bed:- It is estimated that the average bed has over 10,000 house dust mites living in it which results in there being over two million droppings. Encase the mattress in an anti allergy mattress cover. Use anti-allergy duvet and pillow covering. Wash coloured bedding before use to remove loose dye. Wash all bedding at over 60 degrees. If the linen cannot be washed at a high temperature pop it in the freezer for a few hours and then wash at a lower temperature. Avoid bedspreads and quilts as these make ideal homes for housedust mite. Store bedding in breathable plastic bags. Cushions should be washed at 60 degrees every 3 months. Avoid padded headboards as dustmite can breed here. Damp wipe rail bedheads. Try to keep pets out of the bedroom and definitely off of your bed to reduce allergen levels and avoid an allergic night!  6. Wardrobe:- Keep wardrobe doors closed to avoid them collecting dust. Clothes that have just been dry cleaned should be aired outside of the room with windows open and the doors to the rest of the house closed. Do not put damp clothes away in the wardrobe. Place folded garments on wire racks rather than shelves to avoid mould and mites. Avoid mothballs or mothproofer. Use instead dried lavender flowers, dried rosemary or cedar chips in sachets. If suffering from sensitive skin use natural fabrics such as cotton and silk.  7. Floor:- Vacuum daily but remember dust can stay airborne for 3- 4 hours. Slatted beds or metal bases are better than divans as the air can circulate. Also try and choose a style where the vacuum cleaner can go underneath. If having wooden flooring and mats use cotton rugs which can be washed.  8. Walls:- Use low odour or water based quick drying paint when decorating. When decorating ventilate room well and do not sleep in the room until all fumes have dispersed.  9. Radiators:- Remember that central heating too high helps to create an ideal environment for the housedust mite. Try turning the heating down a degree. Keep underneath and behind the radiator regularly vacuumed.

      First steps against mould  First treat the mould already in your home. If you then deal with the basic problem of condensation, mould should not reappear.  To kill and remove mould, wipe down walls and window frames with a fungicidal wash which carries a Health and Safety Executive ‘approval number’. Follow the manufacturers’ instructions precisely. Dry-clean mildewed clothes, and shampoo carpets. Disturbing mould by brushing or vacuum cleaning can increase the risk of respiratory problems.  After treatment, redecorate using a good quality fungicidal paint to help prevent mould. Note that this paint is not effective if overlaid with ordinary paints or wallpaper. The only lasting way of avoiding severe mould is to eliminate dampness. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Is it condensation?  Condensation is not the only cause of damp. It can also come from:   *	leaking pipes, wastes or overflows; *	rain seeping through the roof where a tile or slate is missing, spilling from a blocked gutter, penetrating around window frames, or leaking through a cracked pipe; *	rising damp due to a defective damp-course or because there is no damp-course   These causes of damp often leave a ‘tidemark’.

      First steps against condensation  You will need to take proper steps to deal with the condensation, but meanwhile there are some simple measures you can take right away.  Wipe down the windows and sills every morning. Wring out the cloth rather than drying it on a radiator.  Condensation channels and sponge strips can be bought at DIY shops. They are fitted to windows to collect the condensation and thus help prevent window frames from rotting and avoid damp forming under sills. Care must be taken to fit these devices properly.

      How do I prevent mould growing?   If you can deal with the basic problem of condensation,  mould should not appear.  To kill and remove mould, wipe down walls and windows with a fungicidal wash, following the manufacturers instructions very carefully.  Dry clean mildewed clothes and shampoo carpets.  Disturbing mould by brushing or vacuum cleaning can increase the risk of respiratory problems.  After treating and removing the mould, before redecorating apply a good quality fungicidal paint to help prevent the mould re-occurring.   The only lasting way of avoiding mould is to eliminate dampness.      no wonder i am so bothered by vacuuming. or when someone else does it. i wear a dust mask. brushing too. well, also dust mask time. i can't go near mold. i have had asthmatic attacks from mold when lived in NJ. very scary. and it takes ages for the wheezing to stop-days.

      MOULD (FUNGI) SPORES  A spore is the reproductive body of a mould (fungus). When inhaled, mould spores (found outdoors and in the home) can cause allergic rhinitis.   The spores may cause seasonal allergic rhinitis in areas where moulds are more common at certain times of the year, and perennial allergic rhinitis in areas with constant mould spore production.

      SEASONAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS or Hayfever  Approximately 20% of all cases of allergic rhinitis are seasonal allergic rhinitis.  This is commonly caused by tree, weed, and grass pollen, and mould spores. Seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by pollen is also known as hay fever.  Symptoms occur when pollen and spores are airborne, and this is mainly during the summer.   Some people may find that these symptoms persist after the pollen season in response to irritants such as tobacco smoke, bad smells, changes in temperature, and exercise. 	   	 Symptoms of If you have allergic rhinitis, you may have some of the following symptoms:   *	a runny nose  *	an itchy nose  *	sneezing  *	a blocked nose  *	watery, itchy eyes    These are caused when you breathe in foreign bodies (allergens).   There are different types of allergic rhinitis. These have slightly different symptoms and are caused by different allergens.  Your doctor can help you identify whether you have allergic rhinitis. He or she will ask you about your symptoms and may also examine your nose, eyes, and ears. This will find out how severe your disease is and whether you have any other diseases instead of, or as well as, allergic rhinitis.  To find out what causes your allergic rhinitis, your doctor will probably ask you questions about when you get symptoms, and what foreign bodies you might be exposed to. To find out exactly what you are allergic to, your doctor may give you a skin prick test.   If your symptoms are very bad, your doctor may ask you see an allergy specialist.  ALLERGIC RHINITIS IN CHILDREN  Parents should be aware of signs of allergic rhinitis in their children, such as sneezing, or frequent wiping of the nose with the hand, as children do not always complain such problems. Children who have symptoms for a long time may even assume that this is normal. A blocked nose is likely to occur at night and may result in snoring. 	  Top of page 	 Risk Indicator  Hayfever is not a life threatening condition. Moderate to severe symptoms can however be debilitating and lead to learning disabilities in children. 	  Top of page 	 Triggers WHAT CAUSES ALLERGIC RHINITIS?  Allergic rhinitis is a reaction to small particles in the atmosphere such as pollen.   When these particles come into contact with the lining of the nose of a susceptible person, they trigger an immune response in the nose lining, and this causes the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.   This process is known as an allergic reaction, and the particles that cause it are termed allergens. It happens when the immune system, which is designed to stop invasion by foreign bodies such as bacteria, mounts an inappropriately strong response to harmless substances. This over-reaction by the immune system is what distinguishes individuals with allergy from healthy persons. 	  Top of page 	 What helps? Please see the Rhinitis page for additional info  WHAT DRUGS CAN I TAKE AT THE SAME TIME?  In some cases, a combination of different drugs may be useful in treating allergic rhinitis. Your doctor can advise you on whether you may benefit from this.  Antihistamines and decongestants   Antihistamines are good at treating sneezing, an itchy nose, and a runny nose, but they are less good at treating a blocked nose. They may therefore be used at the same time as oral decongestants, which are effective at relieving a blocked nose.   Combinations of antihistamines and decongestants can counteract all the symptoms of allergic rhinitis on a short-term basis.  Topical corticosteroids and antihistamines  Topical corticosteroids and antihistamines are both very good at treating a runny nose, sneezing, and an itchy nose, and topical corticosteroids are also good at treating a blocked nose. If you have severe allergic rhinitis, your doctor may advise that you use both topical corticosteroids and antihistamines to control your symptoms. 	  Top of page 	 Medication Please see the Rhinitis page for additional info  ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES  There are a number of alternative medicines available for treating allergies.  *	Chinese herbal medicine  *	Homeopathy  *	Herbal remedies  *	Nutritional supplements  *	Food avoidance  *	Saline nasal washes  *	Acupuncture    These are often used by people who do not want to use drugs (eg antihistamines, corticosteroids, or decongestants). However, there is no good evidence that alternative medicine improves the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

      PERENNIAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS  Approximately 40% of all cases of allergic rhinitis are perennial allergic rhinitis. This is caused by year-round exposure to dust mites, pollen (in those areas where exposure is all year), cockroaches, indoor moulds, and pet dander's (e.g. fur, feathers, and skin).   Perennial allergic rhinitis generally lasts for over 9 months of the year.   The main symptoms are:   *	a blocked nose  *	an itchy nose (less common)  *	sneezing (less common)  *	a runny nose (less common)   PERENNIAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS WITH SEASONAL WORSENING (See Hayfever)  Approximately 40% of all cases of allergic rhinitis are perennial allergic rhinitis that worsens during the pollen season.  People who suffer from this have symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis during the year, plus symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the pollen season. 	    	 Symptoms of If you have allergic rhinitis, you may have some of the following symptoms:   *	a runny nose  *	an itchy nose  *	sneezing  *	a blocked nose  *	watery, itchy eyes    These are caused when you breathe in foreign bodies (allergens).

      What else can act as an irritant? Sometimes we don't really think about all the household products that can very dangerous to our health.

      Shampoos and shower gels Check all your shampoos for SLS. It's pretty easy nowadays to find a shampoo that uses an alternate surfactant (cleaning agent), even if the shampoo isn't Organic.  A new concern is about the artificial musks used to fragrance some shampoos. These can accumulate in human and animal tissue, and have been found in breast milk. Rats exposed to high concentrations of certain musks have developed cancer, though there's currently no conclusive proof of adverse effects in humans. It's hard to tell whether a product contains artificial musks, as they're listed only as 'parfum' or 'perfume' on the label. The only way to avoid them is by choosing a non-fragranced product, or asking manufacturers whether they use artificial musks. Unfortunately, they're not obliged to give this information.  If you are allergic to Parabens, then you won't have an alternative. You have to use a certified organic shampoo. Once again though, be careful. Organic is not always organic. Choose your product range very carefully. Avea sell a range of shampoos from Evan and PureNuffStuff.

      What to avoid? Chlorine (Sodium hypochlorite) Many household cleaners contain chlorine bleach. Chlorine bleach, or sodium hypochlorite, is a lung and eye irritant.  If mixed with ammonia or acid-based cleaners (including vinegar), chlorine bleach releases toxic chloramine gas. Short-term exposure to this gas may cause mild asthmatic symptoms or more serious respiratory problems. (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   To be on the safe side, don't mix chlorine bleach with anything -- or just avoid chlorine bleach altogether.  Phosphates  Phosphates are minerals that act as water softeners. Although they are very effective cleaners, phosphates also act as fertilizers.  When cleaning products go down the drain, phosphates are discharged into rivers, lakes, estuaries, and oceans. In lakes and rivers especially, phosphates cause a rapid growth of algae, resulting in pollution of the water.  Many US states have banned phosphates from household laundry detergents and some other cleaning products. Automatic dishwasher detergents are usually exempt from phosphate restrictions, and most major brands contain phosphates.  Alkylphenols and their derivatives  Alkylphenol Ethoxylates are found in some laundry detergents, disinfecting cleaners, all-purpose cleaners, spot removers, hair colours and other hair-care products, and spermicides.  (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)  Alkylphenol Ethoxylates are endocrine disruptors.  (Source: WWF Canada)  Alkylphenols are produced in the environmental breakdown of alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, are slow to bio-degrade and have been shown to disrupt the endocrine systems of fish, birds, and mammals.  (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. All of these products can release pollutants while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored. (Source: EPA)   Some of the hazardous volatile organic compounds that frequently pollute indoor air -- such as toluene, styrene, xylenes, and trichloroethylene -- may be emitted from aerosol products, dry-cleaned clothing, paints, varnishes, glues, art supplies, cleaners, spot removers, floor waxes and polishes and air fresheners. (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas.  Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans. (Source: EPA)   Trichloroethylene is one of the chemicals suspected of causing a cluster of childhood leukemia cases due to drinking water contamination in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts, in the early 1980s. The subsequent lawsuit against the polluting company was the subject of the 1995 book and 1998 film, A Civil Action. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)  High levels of toluene can put pregnant woman at risk of having babies with neurological problems, retarded growth, and developmental problems. Xylenes may also cause birth defects.  (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   Styrene is a suspected endocrine disruptor, a chemical that can interfere, block or mimic hormones in humans or animals. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)   VOCs such as xylene, ketones, and aldehydes are found in many aerosol products and air fresheners. Researchers found that babies less than six months old in homes where air fresheners are used on most days had 30 percent more ear infections than those exposed less than once a week. (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   Levels of formaldehyde in air as low as 0.1 ppm (0.1 part formaldehyde per million parts of air) can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose and throat, stuffy nose, nausea, coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, skin rashes and allergic reactions. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)   Babies frequently exposed to aerosols had a 22 percent increase in diarrhoea, and pregnant women frequently exposed to these products had 25 percent more headaches and a 19 percent increase in postnatal depression compared to those less frequently exposed.   Paints, cleaners, and other products with no or very low levels of VOCs and other hazardous ingredients are available.

      Cleaning Products Cleaning Products and air fresheners  Bleach is powerful, corrosive and toxic while cleaning products for the bath, wash-basin and toilet can irritate the skin and eyes. Use only a little of whatever you buy and look for phosphate-free products which don't upset the balance the natural systems in rivers and lakes. Also, look for biodegradable products that are not based on petrochemicals, and those that come in recyclable containers.   Healthier Alternatives: *	White distilled vinegar can be used to disinfect, clean and deodorize and vinegar diluted in water can also be used as an effective weed killer.  *	Lemon Juice can be used to lighten stains and remove grease.   *	Baking Soda & Washing Soda can both be used as cleaning products. You can mix them with water or a mild liquid soap to help remove dirt and stains

      NasalezeTM - the invisible mask that filters allergens  Sneezing ... runny nose ... watery eyes Now you can combat hay fever and other allergies with our totally natural remedy  NasalezeTM is registered as a Class One Medical Device. It is an inert cellulose powder and has no known side effects. NasalezeTM has the ability to improve the quality of the air reaching the lungs. The powder, when inhaled, works by turning to a gel like material on contact with the moisture which is always present in the nasal tract. This gel then behaves like real mucus in the nasal tract which adsorbs all the dust, germs etc. from the air stream as it passes through on its way to the lungs. It is known that some people who suffer from hay fever, asthma and eczema have a lack of good quality mucus in the nasal tract. NasalezeTM restores this situation back to normality and eliminates most allergic reactions. One sniff into each nostril from the special dispenser will last at least 12 hours.   The nasal tract forcibly separates out any allergens in the inhaled air. The purified air then serves the lungs and enables them to work properly. With clean air there is nothing to cause allergic reactions. When the natural filtration system breaks down, a number of self defence systems come into play. One of these is triggered by the mast cells positioned in the upper nasal tract. They become exposed, then give out histamine and other drugs. One of these is known to cause eczema in some people.  NasalezeTM restores the nasal tract to its full working capacity as a filter which shuts down this self defence system since it is no longer required. It follows that the chemicals, which cause the allergic reactions, are no longer introduced into the blood stream. A whole variety of problems are resolved. We know from experience that in most cases when NasalezeTM is used, hay fever symptoms abate in 3 to 10 seconds.

      Septum Piercing Clothes Depending on the jewelry that you get for this piercing you might want to be carefull when putting on clothes over your head. It might sound silly but catching a piercing on something while its still healing isn't fun.  Healing Time A septum piercing should heal in about 6-8 weeks.  Cleaning  Cleaning a septum piercing is a little different from cleaning other piercings because its not a good idea to stick strange chemicals up your nose.  I recommend salt + water, this shouldn't cause any problems for the inside of the nose.  The best method for cleaning this piercing is probably to dip the end of a cotton wool bud into some salt water so that you can use that to clean around the piercing.  As with all other piercings first clean away any crusty bits - so that they don't make the skin tear when you are cleaning the site.  Put the salt water solution on the piercing, on both sides then rotate the piercing gently.  [ About 1tbl spoon of salt to a cup of water is roughly the right mixture. ]

      Breathe Freely by Removing Excess Mucus  by Robert Elias Najemy Our breath is our basic source of vitality The quantity and quality of the air we take into our lungs is affected to some degree by the amount of mucus, which obstructs the passages of the respiratory system. Also, when there is excess mucus congesting these passageways, there is also a greater possibility for the growth of microbes.  A certain amount of mucus lining is necessary for the protection of the membranes of the respiratory and digestive systems. It serves as a fluid transportation system, which also carries microbes and foreign particles out of the body.   It also protects the walls of the digestive system from acidic digestive juices which would erode them. The movement of a thin layer of mucus acts like a continuously moving conveyer belt, which carries microbes, viruses and other undesirable particles out of the body. If there is a deficiency, then we have the danger of ulcers.   Many, however, people suffer from excessive build-up in their system. This leads to frequent colds, sinusitis and, in general, a «phlegmatic» condition with less energy and vitality.   What can we do when we have excess?   1. Dietary considerations:   In such a case one would do well to avoid the following foods, which increase the amount of mucus in the system: a. All dairy products. b. All white flour products c. White sugar and its products.   2. Cleansing the nostrils with warm salt water or chamomile tea.   a. Wash your hands well and make sure that the glass you use is equally clean.   b. Fill the glass with water as warm as your body temperature and add one level teaspoon of salt or less, according to your taste. The correct proportion of salt is important. If there is too little or too much salt, the solution will sting the inner membranes of the nose. If, however, the solution is right, it will make this an extremely pleasant experience to look forward to practicing every day until the problem is overcome. Some use saline solution used for infusions.   c. Make a cup out of your right palm. Pour the water into your palm, put the glass down and close your left nostril with your left hand.   d. Immediately bring your cupped right palm up to your right nostril and slowly inhale the water into the nostril and take it down into the mouth.   e. Spit the solution out of the mouth and blow each nostril one by one removing any remaining solution of mucus.   f. Do this three times alternately through each nostril. Reverse the hands when doing it through the left nostril.   g. Now bend forward and exhale about twenty times through the nostrils, blowing out any residue water or mucus that has accumulated in the sinuses.   h. Now you may like to gargle with a solution of warm water and salt clearing out the throat passage.   This technique may be done every day for a month or so until the excess mucus is removed. It should not be done when one has a cold but may be done when one is just getting the hint of a cold so as to possibly avoid it. If one comes down with a cold, he should avoid this practice as it might spread the microbes to other parts of the body.    If you have sinusitis, check with your doctor.   3. The stomach wash   This is an extremely effective method of removing extra mucus from the body. It is not nearly as unpleasant as most people imagine it to be before trying it. The fact is that the stomach is the storehouse of mucus for all the body and occasionally needs to be cleaned out. One way to do this is to drink one liter of warm salt water (with one level soupspoon of salt) as quickly as possible.   Then, making sure that the fingers of the right hand are very clean, you stick the index and middle fingers down into the back of the throat and tickle it until you provoke vomiting (make sure that you do not irritate your throat with your fingernails). Continue to provoke vomiting until you feel that most of or all of the water has been thrown out. At the same time mucus will flow forth from the sinuses and tears from the eyes. All of these organs will be simultaneously cleaned.   This technique should be performed on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning upon waking. It may, however, occasionally be used to liberate the stomach of disagreeable or toxic foods that are disturbing the system. It can be used in order to combat a cold or occasionally to remove excess mucus from the body.   This should not be done if have an ulcer.  A half an hour after cleansing, an herb tea, such as chamomile, should be taken with pure honey, so as to soothe the lining of the esophagus.   If you have any serious health problems or doubts concerning whether the above two techniques are safe or suitable for you, you may check with your doctor.   4. Deep, slow breathing also helps clean the nasal passages and enhances the joy breathing. This can be done about 5 to 10 minutes a day. If you desire to do more than that, then check with an experienced breath coach.   ©2003 Your Pure Life.co.uk

      most ppl wouldn't be doing that in the summer, but i am..praying for rain because my hayfever is so bad. got worse when let dog out in the garden, and he ran back in past me. only briefly, but that set it off badly. and it was already bad, so it just got way worse. so i'm thinking he keeps going out and digging in the same hole in the garden, and it may be the soil, as in molds. well, i already know i'm horribly allergic to molds, and they're everywhere.  and it becomes almost the only thing on your mind. rain will settle down all the pollen and mold sores, etc. and none of the allergy meds work very well. all those anti-drowsy ones aren't that good. for me anyway.

      Excessive catarrh is the bodyís way of trying to wash out something it does not want. For viral or bacterial infection this is entirely appropriate. However when the cause is an allergy, excessive catarrh is a real nuisance. Broadly speaking the child with thick secretions and blockage is allergic to foods. The child with thin watery secretions, sneezing and nasal itch (they often have a horizontal crease where the nasal bone ends as a result of rubbing the nose upwards with a flat hand the ìallergic saluteî) is often allergic to inhalants such as house dust mite, pollen or animal furs.

      Bowel disease - the conventinal diagnosis   The medical profession is again guilty of sloppy thinking when it comes to the diagnosis of bowel problems. What it has done is classify disease according to what treatments are available rather than according to the cause of the problem. The result is that the most common bowel disorder namely irritable bowel syndrome is relegated to the psychiatric dustbin. In pharmaceutical medicine no single treatment strategy is available therefore the cause must be psychological.   Furthermore some nasty bowel conditions such as Crohnís disease are treated with symptom suppressing drugs instead of a proper attempt being made to get at the root cause. Avoidance of provoking foods (98% of Crohnís have grain allergy) prevents unnecessary surgery and steroids.   Indigestion is also badly treated with a range of symptom suppressing medication. Many indigestion remedies contain aluminium - a known cause of Alzheimers disease   Symptom suppression is a risky business. Symptoms are a sign of something going wrong. If your diagnosis is wrong when a prescription is made the doctor will not know it because the patient no longer has any symptoms. I still see patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome given symptom suppressing drugs or a psychiatric diagnosis, who turn out to have cancer.

      Nasal polyps If there is on-going unremitting catarrh and post nasal drip it is worth getting an ENT surgeon to look at the back of the nose to see if there is a polyp. These are folds of mucous membrane which have developed as a result of some sort of chronic irritant such as allergy or dusts (eg smoking). Once developed they are unlikely to shrink back and an operation may be needed to get rid of them. One must then think about the cause or they will recur.

      Sinusitis Whoever designed the human body needs a black mark for putting in sinuses! I donít know of any useful physiological function they perform. They are cavities in the bones of the face with only one entry and exit hole which is easily blocked by catarrh or swollen mucous membranes. When this occurs infection may follow on and cause sinusitis. The characteristic feature of sinusitis is pain in the face or headache when one bends down ñ this is due to increased pressure in the sinuses. The acute form is often treated with antibiotics such as doxycycline. But they may also get infected with yeasts and some people need anti-fungals to clear symptoms.

      The catarrhal child - a cause of recurrent colds, ear infections, tonsillitis etc   This is a very common problem and easily recognised. There is a history of recurrent colds, snotty nose with green candles, blocked nose, poor sensations of taste and smell, and mouth breathing. Often there are recurrent attacks of tonsillitis, ear infections, sore throat and perhaps sinusitis. Untreated these children go on to get glue ear and deafness, failure to progress at school and may need grommets inserting.   Excessive catarrh is the bodyís way of trying to wash out something it does not want. For viral or bacterial infection this is entirely appropriate. However when the cause is an allergy, excessive catarrh is a real nuisance. Broadly speaking the child with thick secretions and blockage is allergic to foods. The child with thin watery secretions, sneezing and nasal itch (they often have a horizontal crease where the nasal bone ends as a result of rubbing the nose upwards with a flat hand the ìallergic saluteî) is often allergic to inhalants such as house dust mite, pollen or animal furs.   Other signs of allergy include dark rings under the eyes (ìhe always looks tiredî) and facial pallor (a slightly ìmarbledî appearance).   addition: i have dark circles under my eyes, thanks to the perenial rhinitis. allergies that is, and i look pale. and when i go to see a doctor, or go to the hospital, or a clinic, or a nurse sees me, what's the first thing most say,~you look pale, are you anaemic/ no i am not i reply, it's from allergies, 'perenial rhinitis"  yeah, well like that's no big deal right? my "iron count" has been tested and is fine. other tests fine. all fine of course.  except. ear, nose, and throat consultant a few years back, said my problem was allergies, and the fact that the mucus doesn't drain out though my nostrils. my nose was broken when i was 13, and i have that deviated septum, again by itself ppl would say no big deal ,but when yo uhave allergies and your nostrils have such small openings that the mucus doesn't drain out, and you can't breathe through your nose, and you must breathe almost all the time through your mouth...and get things like sleep apnea, well after years of that...it just gets worse, and worse. he was going to operate on my nose after trying things like steriod sprays etc etc...but the main guy at the dept said no. i think because of the cost. i mean hey it's not that big of a deal is it? yes it is. but other conditions are put way ahead of mine.  so now on my own. will look into privately having nose fixed.

      Introduction: The mucus that lines the airway epithelium provides barrier against pathogenic and noxious agents and participates in the mucosal response to inflammation and infection. Mucins are the major components of mucus and the macromolecules that impart rheologic properties to airway mucus. Airway mucus is overproduced in chronic sinusitis. Biochemical and biophysical characterisation of mucus in chronic sinusitis and in normal airways will elucidate important aspects of chronic sinusitis pathophysiology and allow the design of targeted medical treatments.

      You can carry your own supply of pollen on your clothes and body after being out of doors.   *	Have a shower and wash your hair if you have been out in the open air.  *	It might help to wear wrap-around sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes.     Pollen falls out of the air as the atmosphere cools in the evening.   *	Don’t leave washing on the line too late in the day and close windows before the evening.  *	Avoid pets. Even if you are not allergic to cats or dogs, these animals can bring pollen into the house on their fur.  *	When driving, keep car windows closed.

      How can you cope with your pollen allergy?  It is impossible to avoid pollen completely. However you can help reduce symptoms by cutting down your exposure. Sadly, many people for whom pollen is a trigger find that avoiding pollen seriously reduces their freedom to go out and about as they choose, and they often have to miss the enjoyment of spring and summer weather.   *	Stay indoors as much as possible, particularly in the morning between 7.00am and 9.00am and in the late afternoon.  *	Keep windows and doors shut.  *	Let someone else cut the grass.  *	Although you may never think of grass having pollen, grass is an important source of allergy trigger.  *	Avoid large grassy areas. Camping holidays are not a good idea.  *	When gardening, moisten potting soil before use to avoid mould spores (similar to pollen) becoming airborne.  *	Always wash your hands after gardening.

      quite severe. came on much worse when it was twilight. suddenly felt rather panicky. and at the same time noise was irritating. my gums felt swollen, irritated, then my mouth, then i could feel the sore itchy irritation flowing though the rest of my body, and my heart pumping harder. it felt like burning going around my body. through my lungs, back, abdomen. my ears and nose feel swollen, sore, but mostly the worst is my mouth. maybe it's because there are so many nerve endings there. my chest feels tight, and an overall achiness has come on, and tiredness. benadryl taken. perhaps has helped slightly, since the really strong irritation has gone. the intensity of the reaction is less. ppl are taking my reaction to the environment personally, as when noise suddenly is overwhelming, it hurts. the tightness is like a pressure. ibuprofen taken, hope it will help. hurts when i breathe in the back of where my ribs are. noting that it hurts more when i breathe out. i think. it is hurting all the time. so hard to tell. breathing is more shallow. i can't take medicine for this. eg. inhalers, or decongestants. so i have to cope in other ways. feeling bad about myself, because it is so debilitating.   pollen count is 5-6 here. my allergies have been more severe the past three days at least. today is worse.   cleaning the house, probably added to the reaction. yet i clean with a dust mask on. and glasses. careful about not touching my eyes, nose, mouth with my hands.  the dog is molting, has been for a while, since it started getting warmer. i'm not sure if that is a problem at all, since his dander has been around, and my allergies are worse today.  what is setting me off is he goes outside in the garden, in the grass, and comes in and then that's when i feel pain in sinuses, nose...not sneezing..my nose and sinuses are clogged up all year. i used to sneeze when  i was a teen during these months but now it's gone on to these other symptoms. yes, my nose is irritated but i don't sneeze. i have post nasal drip instead. and the mucus doesn't drain out of my nose hardly at all. it's too clogged up.  got to rest now.

      What use is the pollen count and forecast?  The pollen count is a measure of the number of pollen grains of a certain type per cubic metre of air sampled averaged over a 24 hour period. The reported counts are usually for grass, birch and nettles and refer to the previous 24 hour period up to 9am that day. The pollen counts show when the various seasons start and end as well as the day to day variation in the amount of pollen in the air. This information can be used as a guide both to diagnosis and to the timing of treatments. For example, the start of the grass pollen season in Britain can differ by about 32 days according to the weather in the spring and early summer. The pollen count indicates when prophylactic treatment should be started and when medication can be stopped at the end of the season. The daily pollen forecasts can be used to warn sufferers of adverse conditions so that they can modify their activities and take medication as required.

      Why are some individuals predisposed to allergies?  Predisposed individuals have a condition known as ATOPY (this is a derivation of the Greek word "Atopos" which means out of place"). Atopy is not an illness but an inherited feature, which in turn makes individuals more likely to develop an allergic disorder. Atopy tends to run in families.  The reason why atopic people have a tendency to develop allergic disorders is because they have the ability to produce the allergy antibody called "Immunoglobulin E" or "IgE" when they come into contact with a particular substance.  However, not everyone who has inherited the tendency to be atopic will necessarily go on to develop an allergic disorder, which could include:   *	Asthma  *	Eczema  *	Seasonal rhinitis (hayfever)  *	Perennial rhinitis (all year round symptoms like hay fever)  *	Urticaria (hives or nettle rash)  Nevertheless this inherited tendency or disposition could result in the development of symptoms later in life. We can conclude by stating that people who do not have allergies normally have only small amounts of "IgE".

      Other triggers In addition to these common allergy triggers there are other factors in the environment that can make life difficult for airborne allergy sufferers.   *	Air pollution: High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other chemicals that find their way into the atmosphere can irritate the nose and airways even in those who do not suffer from airborne allergy. One of the effects of the late phase allergic response is to make the nasal passages more sensitive to irritants – something called nasal hyper-responsiveness.  *	Other irritants: Smoke (particularly tobacco), strong smells, perfumes, changes in temperature, or humidity can all provoke symptoms in people who have developed this extra sensitivity (nasal hyper-responsiveness).  *	Diesel fumes: Importantly, there is another factor concerning irritants and pollution in the air. As well as provoking symptoms, by weakening the delicate nasal lining, irritants may increase susceptibility to allergy triggers. Research has shown that diesel particles in the air make people more sensitive to an allergy trigger.  *	Air-conditioned atmospheres: In a person whose nasal lining has been made extra sensitive by repeated allergic attacks, the atmosphere in the work place can provoke symptoms of an airborne allergy even without allergy triggers in the air. Non-allergy, irritant triggers are often found in an air conditioned atmosphere. Chemicals, pollution sucked from outside, changes in air temperature, dust, low humidity and other factors in the ‘sick building syndrome’ can all provoke symptoms. Even good air conditioning, with efficient air filters, while it may reduce the level of pollen, will not eliminate all air pollution.

      Multiple triggers for airborne allergy With so many airborne allergy sufferers allergic either to house dust mite or to pollen, a very high proportion, over 50% of all airborne allergy sufferers, will be allergic to both. In practical terms this will mean that they may suffer airborne allergy symptoms all year round, with symptoms becoming noticeably worse during the pollen season.

      Pets (dander) Cats, in particular, cause allergies but dogs and rabbits too can trigger the itching and sneezing of airborne allergy.  Science has shown that, for most people, it is not the fur itself that causes the allergy problem. Dander, the name given to the mixture of small particles of fur, skin scales (like dandruff) and saliva is the actual cause. In cats, for example, a particular protein found in cats’ saliva causes an allergic reaction in many sufferers of airborne allergy.  Because cats groom themselves so thoroughly, the saliva finds its way onto carpets, furniture and other surfaces. In 40% of people who have allergy affecting their nose their pet is a trigger.

      House dust mites In fact it’s not dust that causes the problem, but a tiny creature called the house dust mite, also known as Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. House dust mites are almost always present in house dust, even in the most clean and tidy homes. In a way, they serve a useful purpose in disposing of skin debris in house dust. Its first name 'Dermatophagoides' is simply Latin for 'skin eating'.  Despite its rather fierce appearance under a microscope, the house dust mite does not bite: it eats the skin flakes that make up a large percentage of house dust. The mite is so small that it is impossible to see with the naked eye. The house dust mite is 80% water and needs a humid environment in which to thrive. They mostly like damp and dusty spots and these can be found somewhere in virtually every home. The house dust mite or, in fact, its waste products or droppings, are the most common trigger of airborne allergy within the home.

      Mould spores Moulds and fungi reproduce by sending out showers of spores into the air. About 20% of people who suffer from airborne allergies are affected by these mould spores. Most will be allergic to more common triggers too and so, for them, the mould allergy is an additional complication rather than the main cause of symptoms. Moulds can grow anywhere, indoors and out. They are most at home in damp conditions - the kitchen and bathroom and in wooden window frames, the soil of houseplants and under wallpaper throughout the house. Outside, moulds are plentiful in the soil, in rotting wood and leaves, grass cuttings and compost heaps.

      Pollen If you are more prone to airborne allergy symptoms at about the same time each year, then the chances are that you are sensitive to the allergic triggers pollen or mould spores. The time of year when you suffer symptoms might give you a good indication of which particular types of pollen are causing the problem.  Hayfever seasons vary from year to year depending on the weather. Nevertheless, you are most likely to encounter the most common allergens in the UK during the following months:   *	Tree pollens: January to June  *	Grass pollens: March to October  *	Weed pollens: May to October  *	Fungal pollens/mould spores: April to November

      How does your allergy happen?  All of us are exposed to different potential allergens at different times of the day. For example, if you go out to work and are affected during the working day then something in your work environment may be the trigger. If your symptoms are worse at bedtime, then it could be house dust mites in and around your bedding that are the trigger.  Where you are when a bout of sneezing starts, as well as the time of day, can provide clues to identify your allergy triggers. For example, if you suffer from airborne allergy symptoms when you are out in countryside then, for you, pollen is most likely a trigger. If this affects you for quite a large part of the spring and summer, then you may be allergic to more than one sort of pollen. There are several triggers that can affect you in the garden. Mowing the lawn throws grass pollen into the air, digging or potting out plants can release mould spores from the soil.

      How important are fungal spores as a cause of hay fever?  Spores from fungi or moulds may produce hay fever in susceptible people but they are a relatively minor cause of seasonal symptoms. Most types of fungal spore that are likely to be culprits, such as Alternaria, Aspergillus and Cladosporium, are abundant in the atmosphere during the late summer and autumn. In Britain over twenty different moulds are known to cause allergic reactions. An allergic person could be sensitive to just one or several of these. Many of the fungi involved can live indoors as well as outside and may be responsible for symptoms of rhinitis over many months resulting in perennial rhinitis rather than hay fever.

      So you want to do a comic strip, huh? You have a great idea and/or a burning desire but you have no clue what to do next? Here's a list of Do's and Don'ts that may help.  But first, let's get through the bad news right up front, so you can determine how burning your desire really is. The bad news is, this is an extremely competitive business. Look at the comic page in your newspaper. How many strips do you see there? 15? 30? Maybe more? How many of them are NEW? How many have been there since the invention of paper? Now consider this: there are roughly 200 syndicated comic strips out there, battling it out for a bit of precious space on that comic page. If you could see the comics in every newspaper in the country on any given day, you'd see pretty much the same strips in every paper. There are 30 or so that have a lock on the comic page -- some for decades. But new strips DO break in and yours will certainly be one. IF you can make the syndicate cut. More bad news... There are 5 major syndicates (the nice folks who represent cartoonists and columnists, selling their work to newspapers). Each year, these syndicates get thousands of submissions. Each year, each syndicate might pick 2 or 3. So there may be 15 new comic strips introduced annually. Sounds like reasonable odds. But do you ever see these 15 new strips in your newspaper? No. You may see a couple. And they probably don't last. The failure rate for new strips is about 50%. Still, statistically, your odds of hitting with a strip are better than hitting the lottery or getting hit by lightning. Good enough, you say? OK. Then let's move on to the list of Do's and Don'ts. The DO's 1. DO write, write, write. A successful comic strip is about good writing. Readers may appreciate good art, but it's the CONTENT of the strip that brings them back day after day. Good writing can support bad drawing (do I need to name names?) but bad writing will kill a strip, no matter how great the art is. When I first created Luann, I wrote 200 strips. I picked the best 24, inked those and submitted them. The advantage here is that by writing a LOT, you become a better writer AND you learn about your characters. Well-defined characters are essential to a good strip. Vague, inconsistent, uninteresting characters are worthless. You need to find out which of yours are strong and which are weak. You only learn this by writing. After I sent my first submission, three syndicates expressed interest in Luann and asked for a second batch of samples. I wrote 100 more strips and picked the best 24. I firmly believe that your second batch should be as good as -- even BETTER than -- your first. Syndicates want to know that you're not a one-shot wonder, that you have the chops to keep producing day in, day out, forever. This is a long-term commitment. 2. DO look in a mirror. Figuratively, not literally. Look inside yourself and identify your personal strengths, knowledge, talents, quirks. What makes you unique? How can you bring this uniqueness to a comic strip? The best strips are ones that reveal the individual behind them. Consider Peanuts or Calvin and Hobbes. Could you or I have come up with a similar concept? Sure. Would it have been the same? No. Because these strips aren't about little kids and dogs and a stuffed tiger. They're about the unique senses of humor, points of view, attitudes and philosophies of Schulz and Watterson. They brought their own personal voice to their work. You need to do the same. 3. DO take this job seriously. If doing a comic strip is something you'd kind of like to try, forget it. You need a deep, burning passion. It's a demanding job. You have to write and draw 365 strips annually, year after year, with no breaks. You spend most of your time in solitary confinement, bent over a drawing board, with an incessant deadline breathing down your neck. You get a week of strips done, sent off... and you have to start all over again. It's not a job for the casual dabbler. Only the cartoon-bug-bitten, insanely dedicated, fanatically driven need apply. The DON'Ts 1. DON'T be a clone. Copying is a fine way to learn the craft of cartooning. Nearly all cartoonists learn by studying the work of other cartoonists. In fact, the best cartooning school is the comic page of your newspaper. But when it's time to create a new strip, do not copy. Don't do another FarSideBloomCountyCalvin. Yeah, we all love and miss those great strips. But they've been DONE -- and done well. You'll only do a pale imitation. And get rejected. 2. DON'T try to create a "product." Naturally, you want to make scads of money by licensing your strip for use on products, TV shows, giant balloons, etc. But trying to create a strip with products in mind never works. A strip has to have heart and soul and personality. It has to connect with readers first, then, MAYBE, products will follow. But don't be too eager here. Other than Snoopy and Garfield, there aren't many comic strip characters raking in the licensing dough. 3. DON'T use "permanent" markers. Not if you want your work to last. It's OK to use markers, but be wary. "Permanent" markers aren't. In time, they fade, particularly if exposed to light. I've sun-tested nearly all of them and I found a few that passed the fade test: Micron Pigma and Fountain Pentel are the most common. There are others. Experiment. Some cartoonists sidestep pens and paper all together and create virtual strips on the computer with a pad, stylus and drawing program. I have trouble drawing this way, but I do use the computer for my lettering, shading and coloring of Sundays. If you're a purist, you'll use India ink (with brush or pen) on Strathmore board. 4. DON'T go overboard with your submission. OK, you've drawn up your strip and you're ready to send it off. But, gee, if syndicates get thousands of submissions, how will yours stand out? Should you throw a handful of glitter into the envelope? Pack the strips into a nice fruit basket? Sculpt little clay models of your characters? No. These gimmicks only annoy syndicate editors (who have seen it all, trust me). You want to send a submission that's clean, simple, clear and, obviously, brilliant. THAT will get an editor's attention. For a detailed description of how to submit, along with other useful info, go to the comics.com home page, click on "Contact Us" at the bottom, then click the "Submissions" link. There's lots of other information and technical stuff that you may need to know. But the advice above should be enough to get you started on the right track. Remember, the odds are in favor of your work being rejected. Don't be discouraged by this. Few cartoonists hit the first time out. Usually, your first attempts aren't your best work. I tried a dozen different strip concepts before Luann emerged.  I was 35 when Luann came to me. Most cartoonists are well seasoned when they begin their career. There are no 17-year-old comic strip cartoonists in the newspaper. It's not ageism; it's just that it takes a certain level of maturity and life experience to write a good comic strip. So you may just have to keep writing and drawing -- and waiting until you're 25. Which leads me to one last point -- and the best news of all. This is truly a bias-free business. Syndicates, newspapers and readers don't care (or even KNOW) about your age, gender, ethnic background, experience or that you live with your grandmother on a farm in South Dakota. You don't need an agent, a 'connection' or a wad of money to submit. It's one of the hardest jobs to get, but it's one of the easiest to apply for. All you need is a great comic strip. So go get to work. Best of luck to you. -Greg Evans  source www.comics.com

      The Darkness dismissed as 'novelty' by Glastonbury bosses  30/07/2004 - 12:10:30   The Darkness have hit out at the organisers of Britain's Glastonbury Festival after they claimed the band demanded €1.5m to perform at this year's event. Festival creator Michael Evans also dismissed the I Believe in a Thing Called Love rockers as a "novelty" band - which has riled frontman Justin Hawkins. He says: "Eavis went to the newspapers and accused us being mercenary and looking for a million pounds to play at the festival which frankly isn't true. "The fact is that we approached them at Christmas time and they weren't interested because they thought we were a novelty band and wouldn't be around. "Obviously, Reading booked us for their festival so when they (Glastonbury) came back later they had to match that offer or else we wouldn't consider it." Hawkins also attacks the way Glastonbury is run: "So Michael Eavis altruistically lets out all that land with the sole purpose of donating to good causes? "Not at all for the purpose of raising his profile and making an absolute fortune out of an overpriced festival?"

      THE WILL TO DEATH — John Frusciante Hey John, heard that.  There's a fine line between being prolific and being a pest.   Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante hasn't crossed it yet — but he's definitely inching closer with The Will to Death, his second solo CD this year and one of several due in coming months.  A tender concept disc about love, loss and existence, Will to Death's dozen sketchy cuts contain the poetically confessional lyrics, organically flowing arrangements and basement-fi experimentalism that have already come to define Frusciante's solo approach.   Which is a nice way of saying that if you've heard one of his discs, you've sorta heard them all.  But unless he plans to vary his routine a little — or at least write some stronger choruses — we might not need to hear many more.  Track Listing:  • 1. Doubt • 2. Exercise • 3. Time Runs Out • 4. Loss • 5. Unchanging • 6. Mirror • 7. Loop • 8. Wishing • 9. Far Away • 10. Days Have Turned • 11. Helical • 12. Will to Death     Sun rating (out of 5 stars)    2004-07-06    	 	 by Darryl Sterdan Sun Media        COMMENTS FOR THIS ARTICLE       	weezeetooth	2004-07-08 it seems to me that this album contains elements of 'to record water' while maintaining the compositional strength and listenability of 'shadows collide' and the experimental train-of-thought flow of 'niadara lades'. it's extremely intimate and beautiful. fans will love this.       	jesse	2004-07-09 it is beautiful

      ohn Frusciante Set to Release "ATAXIA Automatic Writing" on Record Collection August 10  LOS ANGELES, CA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 07/19/2004 -- ATAXIA "Automatic Writing" is the second album in John Frusciante's five-record series coming out this year on Record Collection. A collaboration with Josh Klinghoffer (Bicycle Thief) and Joe Lally (Fugazi), ATAXIA is a five-song full-length clocking in at 44 minutes.   "Automatic Writing" follows "The Will To Death," which was released on June 22nd. John has been recording an album every month this year and will release them about that often. All the music will be released on vinyl as well as on CD.   ATAXIA   "Automatic Writing"   I became friends with the members of Fugazi in Spring of 1999. They were my favorite band in the world and I was going to see them play live as much as possible. I am lucky to have seen them as much as I have. They have had a hugely positive effect on me, both as a musician and as a person. Joe Lally moved to LA from DC in October of last year. Josh Klinghoffer and I had done two experimental electronic shows here in LA at the Knitting Factory, both of which Joe had attended. We scheduled two more shows, thinking we would play songs off the at that time unreleased "The Will To Death" and soon to be released "Shadows Collide With People." We asked Joe if he would play bass for us, to which he said yes. But I started to realize, very much in the spirit of that period of time, that I was not interested in repeating things I had done, but wished to do things that were new.   The three of us agreed on a basic musical direction and we started rehearsing, playing long improvisations with repetitive bass lines and exploratory drums and guitar. We would record them and at night I would write vocals for my favorite pieces. At rehearsal I would sing, trying to adjust to playing in an exploratory way while simultaneously singing. Joe wrote vocals to one song and Josh wrote vocals to two.   We were feeling very much like the music was playing us. There is this feeling that often comes when playing music with people which is that music is just there and we, as musicians, are sucked into its swirling energy. That is what it felt like, and we felt so good about the songs that had resulted from these improvisations that we decided to book studio time. We thought we would record it all in one day, but we ended up recording 90 minutes of music in four days. We recorded for two days, then played the two shows at the Knitting Factory, then recorded for another two days. Everything was recorded live in the studio with most of the lead vocals recorded with basic tracks. We spent an equal amount of time experimenting with electronics and doing treatments as we did recording the band. The sessions will be released in two halves. The first is called Automatic Writing and will be released on August 10th. The other half will probably come out in January or February.   These were very exciting records to make. Normally in the recording studio there is a sense of being careful in the performance, but on this record there was a sense of abandonment and being out of control. When one records on tape there is no fixing to be done. What occurs during the live tracking is all there is, but instead of being careful we just went off. It was a great feeling. Basically, the three week period this music was made in was a very exciting time and I feel like I will always hear that music with the same sense of wonderment I feel now, which is just with a question in my mind of, "how did this happen?" It happened so quickly and I would rate our best moments with some of the most powerful feelings I have ever felt in my life.   Listening to what we did I am, without fail, shocked by what a deep groove Joe lays down and how free, yet solid, Josh's playing is. There was a great feeling that ran through everything which was that at any second something could go wrong...yet it never did. Josh and I went on to do other records and other experimental shows, one of which featured Joe in a completely different context. I have had other musical relationships with great musicians where the music just floated into thin air without being properly recorded. I am glad that in this case I had the perseverance to document what took place between the three of us.   This record marks the first time I am extensively using the synthesizer in a way that has nothing to do with 80's synthesizer sounds. I am using it to treat the vocals, the drums etc. as well as to make noise that has more to do with feedback and computer noise music (like Pita) than with anything people normally associate with the synthesizer. As I said in my bio for "The Will To Death," I am drawing inspiration for how to approach my modular synthesizer from music that has no synthesizer, such as The Velvet Underground and Max Neuhaus, as well as synthesizer music that has no relationship to the way synths are used in pop music, such as Iaanis Xenakis and David Tudor.   Hats off to early PIL as well...from all of us in Ataxia.   - John Frusciante   JOHN FRUSCIANTE "The Will To Death" -- 6.22.2004   ATAXIA "Automatic Writing" -- 8.10.2004   JOHN FRUSCIANTE "DC EP" (produced by Ian MacKaye) -- 9.14.2004   Stay tuned....   www.johnfrusciante.com   www.recordcollectionmusic.com

      John Frusciante's Second Coming  The second album in John Frusciante's mammoth five album series will be released on August 10.  The second album in the series 'Automatic Writing' will be released under the name Ataxia. It comes just two months after 'The Will To Death' was released in June by the Red Hot Chili Peppers gguitarist.  Ataxia is a collaboration with Josh Klinghoffer (Bicycle Theif) and Joe Lally (Fugazi). "I became friends with the members of Fugazi in Spring of 1999," John said in a statement. "They were my favorite band in the world and I was going to see them play live as much as possible. I am lucky to have seen them as much as I have. They have had a hugely positive effect on me, both as a musician and as a person. Joe Lally moved to LA from DC in October of last year. Josh Klinghoffer and I had done two experimental electronic shows here in LA at the Knitting Factory, both of which Joe had attended. We scheduled two more shows, thinking we would play songs off the at that time unreleased "The Will To Death" and soon to be released "Shadows Collide With People." We asked Joe if he would play bass for us, to which he said yes. But I started to realize, very much in the spirit of that period of time, that I was not interested in repeating things I had done, but wished to do things that were new".    Ataxia is different to his previous solo work and his work with the Chili Peppers. "This record marks the first time I am extensively using the synthesizer in a way that has nothing to do with 80's synthesizer sounds" he says. "I am using it to treat the vocals, the drums etc. as well as to make noise that has more to do with feedback and computer noise music (like Pita) than with anything people normally associate with the synthesizer. As I said in my bio for "The Will To Death," I am drawing inspiration for how to approach my modular synthesizer from music that has no synthesizer, such as The Velvet Underground and Max Neuhaus, as well as synthesizer music that has no relationship to the way synths are used in pop music, such as Iaanis Xenakis and David Tudor".  The third in the series of five records is DC EP, produced by Ian MacKaye. It will come out on September 14.  Also this month, Red Hot Chili Peppers Live at Hyde Park featuring John will be released in territories outside the United States.    By Paul Cashmere

      Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante offers the second of his six planned 2004 CD releases Aug. 10 with Automatic Writing - the debut disc from his Ataxia project. Ataxia also include the Bicycle Thief's Josh Klinghoffer and Fugazi's Joe Lally. Frusciante was especially excited to work with a member of his "favorite band in the world" - Fugazi, whom he says "had a hugely positive effect on me, both as a musician and as a person."

CLICK HERE --- No Bulletin Board --- --- Not in Chart ---   RHCP - Biggest doesn't mean best Red Hot Chili Peppers Extras     Red Hot Chili Peppers : Edinburgh Murrayfield Stadium Rock'n'roll is a game. A big, stupid, sometimes hilarious, often seemingly pointless, occasionally even deadly game. But a game, none the less. And if you're going to play the game then, like it or not, you either follow the few moronically simple rules, or you risk pissing off a fair proportion of the people who've coughed up actual money to watch you jig about like excited children. Red Hot Chili Peppers, 20 years into a journey closer to a Shakespearean tragedy than a career, rather obviously disagree. That they disagree despite their willingness to play an alcohol-free, all-ages show at Scotland's biggest sports stadium with no new album to promote is probably a stance that constitutes playing the game so hard you stand a real risk of getting impregnated by it. The Chili Peppers are, of course, one of the biggest, most spectacular bands in the world: I know this because I've heard all their records and seen the sales figures. If, however, I'd simply turned up to Murrayfield expecting to be entertained to within an inch of my life (for my £35), I'd have been sorely disappointed, because those four attractive, tanned millionaires up there patently feel there's somewhere else they'd rather be. Perhaps back home stroking the lizard by the pool? Perhaps sucking down a mocktail somewhere on a luxurious and well-deserved holiday? Who knows? Wherever they want to be, it certainly isn't here in front of another adoring crowd, smiling and screaming, waiting patiently for 'Give It Away' and freaking out to 'The Zephyr Song'. It isn't, by any means, all their fault. Shows in daylight strip any gig of atmosphere and magic and the mix leaves them sounding tinny, with John Frusciante's guitar lost when he isn't soloing (which, to be honest, isn't often). 'Can't Stop', 'Around The World' and 'Scar Tissue' are stunning opening tracks, but 20 minutes has slipped by before Anthony Kiedis acknowledges our presence, and that's only to mention how tired he is. Flea gurns like a teenage E-fiend and John spanks his plank to the point of insanity, but 'By The Way' is held up by a backs-turned chat, evidently some of it hysterically funny but, you know, there's 70,000 of us here (almost £2.5m in ticket sales) and we're keen to get on with things. Even the cover of Looking Glass' 1972 radio-smash 'Brandy' and its properly fruity vibes eventually, and inevitably, gets buried under all the soloing and anvil-on-the-testicles face-pulling. Before 'I Like Dirt' John announces he's going to call a sick friend from his mobile so we can tell him we "love" him. A beautiful gesture, but it means we stand there staring at our nails for five long minutes while he waits for an answer. Then someone else picks up and he has to fetch John's mate. Then Kiedis decides he wants to have a private word. Then, some significant time later, I think after Flea finishes an email to his accountant, but I might be wrong, we get another song. Like, wow! Thanks! 'Californication' and 'Parallel Universe' are truly brilliant, moving moments, but do we really need to suffer a ten-minute trumpet solo before a limp jazz version of 'Under The Bridge'? No. Does anyone really believe Kiedis when he mumbles through some horrible anecdote about wanting to move to Scotland, "when I'm, like, 652"? No. Is 45 Grave's 'Black Cross' the cover of the night? No, that's John's startling falsetto croon through Donna Summer's 'Love To Love You Baby'. Are Red Hot Chili Peppers uncomfortable with the hyper-inflated level of their own success? Quite probably, and their desire to keep things interesting is admirable. But, really, this isn't the way to do it.  Rob Fitzpatrick  from nme.  me: look it's OBVIOUS that NME has decided to go against the RED HOTS. they keep having anti-chili pepper letters in their mag. that are lies. even stupid ones. like the cost of the concert tickets, or stuff at the concert. i know, i went.  could it be that NME has clued in a while back about the RED HOTS anti-war stance. at Cardiff the last word siad on stage was, and i paraphrase, stop the war, by FLEA. who is by now a legendary bass player. NME hasn't noticed this. are they tone-deaf and dumb as in stupid? i suppose these nme twits would rather picnic at glastonbury with strawberries and champagne. music what music? nme ppl. where's the booze.  chilis. snore. we're not into drinking, and drugs anymore. aha! see.? see what's going on. they aren't at the festivals promoting beer for the beer companies. on the DVD greatist hits, only their drummer chad drinks a couple of lite beers before going on stage, the rest drink green tea, ginseng, and do yoga. chad is still in great shape. plus the label of the beer he is drinking is never shown. no ads for the beer.

      Chili Peppers: Live In Hyde Park   31.07.2004 By RUSSELL BAILLIE   (Herald rating: * * * *)   A hefty souvenir of America's biggest band scaring the ducks in London   Aha, the live album, and a double at that. No, they don't make them like they used to, especially in an age where many are the soundtrack for an in-concert DVD, milking one's more diehard fans before starting another album-tour cycle. In the vinyl era, they used to be an event and, often, an act's defining moment. Just ask our cover stars, the MC5.   For those growing up a long way from the rest of world, the sound of a crowd cheering the start on track one, side one was the first hint how exciting this rock'n'roll stuff could get. Much blame can be directed at Cheap Trick's Live at Budokan for why yours truly is on this page and not next door subbing the racing results.   Anyway, here it is - the first live Red Hot Chili Peppers album, recorded in London in June before a couple of hundred thousand people over three nights. Sounds like it was quite an event, especially considering the opening act was a young whipper-snapper named James Brown.   He's not heard here but Anthony Kiedis mentions meeting him backstage, and songs like Get On Top, Throw Away Your Television and the newbie Rolling Sly Stone remind that, like the Godfather, they remain effortlessly funky.   This does bring back some memories of the Chili Peppers' Western Springs show back in late 2002, post the release of the brilliant and enduring By the Way album, with much of the 27 songs from its predecessor Californication.   It has its fair share of tangential moments, like covers including their take on Donna Summer's I Feel Love, the 70s Looking Glass hit Brandy, and Black Cross by 80s LA metallers .45 Grave which, with the sonic weirdness of Flea's Trumpet Treated by John, makes for an amusingly indulgent closing. And there are plenty of other excursions which remind what good players they are, and leave any other stadium rock act of the age sounding like unmusical simpletons.   Those who appreciate fleet-fingered rock counterpoint will find themselves lapping up the extended intros and outros of guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea, the best saved for last on Give It Away with its crazed genre-mashing instrumental of an ending which turns the old classic rap-rock hit into a 13-minute odyssey.   As an album, it's thankfully not a greatest hits with an applause track, though it's a little long and meandering to sustain the attention all the way through its double CDs. But this is proof that the latest RHCP studio albums were models of restraint: live, nobody lets loose quite like them.   Label: Warners

      THE Red Hot Chili Peppers have rocked the Democratic National Convention in a concert sponsored by political advocates and the Recording Industry Association of America - easily the convention's biggest and best party so far.   Performance ... lead singer Anthony Kiedis does his thing. While everyone else in attendance had the upcoming presidential election in mind, the Los Angeles-based band made only a couple of vague political statements.  "The next four years in this country can be a more peaceful world," said bassist Flea, typically shirtless and sinewy on a stage erected outside the upscale Louis Boston clothing store.   "Do what you gotta do," lead singer Anthony Kiedis said at the end of the band's set.  No matter - the Chili Peppers let their music speak for them, and the coat-and-tied crowd responded, despite an intermittent drizzle.  Actor and director Tony Goldwyn, co-president of The Creative Coalition - a political advocacy group made up of members of the entertainment industry - said the Red Hot Chili Peppers were a natural choice for the show "because they're fantastic, and everybody wants to come see them and we love their music".  The foursome played mostly newer songs - including Scar Tissue, By the Way and Californication - but they finished off the night with their best-known hit from the early 90s, Give It Away.

      Live in Hyde Park Released: 26/7/2004    Live in Hyde Park Released: 26/7/2004 If you weren't one of the many getting a bit wet in Hyde Park last month for the much-lauded Chili Peppers gig, here is your chance to get a full earful of what went on. In a turnaround to shame the Greek Olympic committee, the double disc release comes just a month after the LA funksters came to London. Some hailed the live shenanigans as an extravaganza, while others bemoaned their growing tiredness – however, burned onto CD the whole thing sounds like it kicked proverbial backsides. Can't Stop gets thing bouncing along with the foursome visiting their past (Under The Bridge, Californication), their present (By The Way, Fortune Faded) and their future (Rolling Sly Stone, Leverage Of Space, Mini-Epic). They also have a good old mess around with Donna Summer's I Feel Love which is pretty entertaining. all of the music, none of the mudbath. cant be bad.  from megastar. who obviously don't get it. ie. i feel love was only part of the song, done by john in quite a jokey way. while the rest stood back, and we all went holy shit, i can't believe he can sing that high, and hit those notes. then he stopped after the first refrain. i don't know what the olympic stuff has to do with this at all. thrown together review definately.

      Rain Can't Dampen Red Hot Chili Peppers    Thursday July 29, 2004 8:16 AM   AP Photo MACK101   By CHRISTY LEMIRE   AP Entertainment Writer   BOSTON (AP) - A little rain couldn't dampen the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band completely rocked Wednesday night in a concert sponsored by The Creative Coalition and the Recording Industry Association of America - easily the biggest and best party so far during the Democratic National Convention.   While everyone else in attendance had the upcoming presidential election in mind, the Los Angeles-based band made only a couple of vague political statements.   ``The next four years in this country can be a more peaceful world,'' said bassist Flea, typically shirtless and sinewy on a stage erected outside the upscale Louis Boston clothing store.   ``Do what you gotta do,'' lead singer Anthony Kiedis said at the end of the band's set.   No matter - the Chili Peppers let their music speak for them, and the coat-and-tied crowd responded, despite an intermittent drizzle.   Actor and director Tony Goldwyn, co-president of The Creative Coalition - a political advocacy group made up of members of the entertainment industry - said the Red Hot Chili Peppers were a natural choice for the show ``because they're fantastic, and everybody wants to come see them and we love their music.''   The foursome played mostly new songs - including ``Scar Tissue,'' ``By the Way'' and ``Californication'' - but they finished off the night with their best-known hit from the early '90s, ``Give It Away.''   Guests nibbled on lobster rolls and cotton candy under a giant white tent next to the stage, where tables were swathed in yellow and orange. In the VIP area inside the store, chef Pino Maffeo had whipped up a menu that included fried oysters wrapped in thinly sliced watermelon, Kobe beef and warm ice cream. (Don't ask - it involves a complicated machine that makes the ice cream warm but doesn't melt it entirely.)   Among the celebrities with access to such delicacies were actors Jason Bateman, Alyssa Milano, Richard Schiff, Wendie Malick and Ellyn Burstyn. Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News Channel talk show host whose political views don't exactly jibe with those of the people in town for the convention, also was there.   And Ben Affleck, the Bostonian who's been ubiquitous this week, made a heavily escorted escape after the concert was done.

      JOHN FRUSCIANTE at the Knitting Factory’s AlterKnit Lounge, March 12 The Red Hot Chili Peppers have built an image antithetical to subtlety, and guitarist John Frusciante has chosen to break that mold. Of course the last two releases by the groundbreaking L.A. rock/funk outfit have expressed more mature subject matter — simply and precisely composed, and textured by Frusciante’s silky, melodic approach to his instrument and to songwriting. Tonight, though, he attempted to engage on more visceral and ambient levels by channeling a raw and seemingly unrehearsed soundscape. A shoeless Frusciante sat on the floor of the stage and remained there as he sucked us into his own world with an almost uncomfortably intimate demeanor. After greeting the small room, he assaulted the crowd with 20 minutes of ear-splitting synthesized noise and modulated feedback à la Brian Eno and Flying Saucer Attack, a movement in chaos colored with hints of melody from the underlying drone of a recorded choir ensemble.    Cameras flashed distractingly as the audience was suspended in anticipation of the songs they had come to hear (and never did). When Frusciante finally picked up his guitar and was joined by second guitarist Josh Klinghofer, they wove a 10-minute instrumental, sweet with impeccable licks that could have been picked up off of the cutting-room floor of a Velvet Underground session. Then Frusciante stood, waved, smiled and left. Inviting a voyeuristic viewpoint into the creative process, he left the impression that this was an artist worthy of attention outside of his band. He had displayed the validity of honest music-making, void of labels and pretense. (Ryan Ward)

      ohnny Ramone's Deathwatch Postponed by Steven Mikulan     Last Tuesday, the Internet lit up with rumors of Johnny Ramone’s imminent death. Quoting former band drummer Marky Ramone, Rolling Stone’s Web site announced June 15 that the Ramones guitarist and co-founder had prostate cancer.  “Johnny’s been a champ in confronting this,” Marky told R.S., “but at this point I think the chances are slim.” The chances, that is, of Johnny leaving Cedars-Sinai through its front doors.  The news traveled fast and far. London’s Express bannered the story “Curse of the Ramones,” and, according to the Independent, a stadium crowd of 50,000 Scots attending a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert yelled, “Johnny, we love you!” into guitarist John Frusciante’s cell phone, which had Ramone on the other end.  If Johnny were to die, he would be the third member of the four punk godfathers to pass away in middle age — singer Joey died of lymphoma in 2001, bassist Dee Dee OD’d in 2002. The problem with the pre-obits is that Johnny was not about to die. Not this week, at least. True, the 55-year-old L.A. resident had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years ago and was in Cedars for an infection related to that illness. But by Thursday, MTV’s Web site was carrying a report that his irate wife, Linda, had authorized his physician to deny that his patient’s condition was grave and to confirm that he was expected to return home this week.  The morbid feeding frenzy stirred in the press by Marky Ramone’s initial comments underscored not only the Ramones’ enduring popularity but also the media’s fascination with celebrity death. The weeklong rites surrounding Ronald Reagan’s passing were nothing less than a funeral festival — part Bayreuth, part P.T. Barnum. Ironically, Reagan was Johnny’s hero, so much so that the deeply conservative Ramone successfully fought to have the band’s song “My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down” renamed from its original title, “Bonzo Goes to Bitburg.”  Even members of the oft-feuding Ramones family, however, admit that Johnny is not the type of person who would announce he had cancer, let alone indicate how serious his condition was. Monte Melnick, the band’s road manager for its entire 22-year career and co-author of On the Road With the Ramones, told the Weekly that Johnny “ate healthy and didn’t smoke or drink” but, like many men, avoided getting prostate exams until it was too late.  “He’s had prostate cancer for a while,” Melnick said. “People get wind of that and call Marky, and with his big mouth it becomes a deathwatch thing.”  Writer-musician George Tabb, a longtime friend of the band’s, e-mailed the Weekly to say, “It’s a very sad time in the history of rock . . . The Ramones changed the face of rock & roll forever. Not only that — as people they changed the lives of tens of thousands of kids. One soul at a time.”

      Triple Echo Changing Channels John Frusciante’s brave new frequencies by John Payne    John Frusciante (Photo by Mike Piscitelli)    A couple of weeks ago I spent some time talking to guitarist-composer John Frusciante, best known as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but also recognized by those close to him as a bit of a seeker — of new ways of making music, and new ways of unlocking the doors of perception. Frusciante is in the final stages of a very ambitious dream project, which is to record and release an album a month for up to a year. So far, one has been released, The Will to Death. The second, Automatic Writing, due August 10, is the first half of a collection that’ll come out under the band name Ataxia, recorded with Fugazi bassist Joe Lally and Bicycle Thief drummer Josh Klinghoffer, the latter of whom also collaborates with Frusciante on The Will to Death and the forthcoming albums in the series.  These wide-ranging (acoustic/electric, vocal/instrumental, short-form/long-sprawl) recordings reject modernity’s emphasis on painstakingly slow and scientific methods for constructing pop product with digital perfection. Frusciante’s new music is all recorded and mixed on magnetic tape as quickly and spontaneously as humanly possible, with 16 tracks at most. He is, he says, fed up with the way late-vintage studio technology has stultified the creative process. In order to be immersed in the moment, with the possibility of glimpsing the future, he feels, it’s important to look to the past. Music’s “spirits,” he says, would tell you the same.     L.A. WEEKLY: These records are different from the way most pop music is conceived and created.  JOHN FRUSCIANTE: I wanted to make records inexpensively, and I wanted to make them quickly. I would listen to something like Frank Zappa’s Hot Rats album, where if he played a guitar solo, there was one take, maybe two, and any musician who was playing with him had to be good enough to be able to do shit in a couple of takes. All the great recorded music from the ’50s was played live [in the studio], to the ’60s, where a record was often made in a few hours.  And I was inspired by the great performances people do when they go live on a radio show and perform, when the pressure’s on, and they respond to that. We did a little test where we had two days in the studio and we mainly recorded three songs in those two days, and once we saw that we could go that quickly, we just started going off — we did basically six records in six months.     With the same kind of technical setup? I have a certain amount of equipment that I bring to studios myself, but we go to studios that have tape machines, and we put 16 tracks on 24-track machines. Once we started doing The Will to Death, we started doing other things to be contrary to the way people do it nowadays; we really tried to pay attention to the way the people did it in the old days. In the old days, you didn’t wait till the mix to make decisions, you had to make decisions while you were recording.  That steamy, exotic quality that dub producer Lee Perry got had a lot to do with the fact that he used four-tracks and crammed so much into the recordings, so the tracks bled and smeared all over each other.  On my machine, when you take three tracks and mix them onto one track, they sound better after the bounce than they did before. There’s something about squeezing in that space that’s really a wonderful thing.   Analog sounds the best to me, and I feel that’s how my music should be recorded. I’m not gonna go on a big tirade against computers, because a lot of music I really love is done on them. I would point out, though, that somehow, as convenient as computers make things, albums take longer to record now than they did in the ’50s or the ’70s. So I don’t know if the convenience is actually convenient; I think it’s just the illusion of convenience, and in actuality it makes things more complicated.     Might be that the computer confronts the musician with an infinity of choices; that can be paralyzing. You, however, talk about working with restrictions. When you know you only have 8 tracks or 16 tracks . . . . . . You have to work with it, and it brings the best out of you. Magnetic tape is the way I like doing it; it’s really fun for me. I like doing first takes, I don’t like doing multiple takes, I don’t like comping, I don’t like doing all that bullshit. For me, the first take has a special excitement to it.       How are the Ataxia albums different conceptually from the others in the series? The pieces start out as jams by Joe Lally and Josh and myself; then I put vocals over them, then those vocals turn the jams into songs, although the bass lines are very repetitive — it’s very Public Image–inspired, real repetitive bass lines, or a big dub sound on the bass, and lots of fucked-up guitar playing, lots of dynamics and so on.       When musicians have focused on capturing spontaneity and giving it a shape — rather than using music to express their egos — it has resulted in a lot of timeless music. That was a big part of making these records. As human beings, we have these factors of randomness that come into anything we do. We’re not in control of how it’s gonna come out; if I plan on singing a note, my voice might crack on that note, or be a bit wobbly — the idea is to be ready for things like that to happen, and welcome them.    I like seeing the music change over the course of time. I’m in a phase where I like playing guitar that’s out of my control, either that there’s so much energy coming through me that I’m matching it that way, or just playing in a way that leaves a lot open to noise and feedback. You hear a lot of that on the Ataxia and Inside of Emptiness records [the latter will be the fourth in the set].     It stands to reason that when you keep the ego out of it, you have a better chance of making music that stands the test of time, because it’s both part of you and beyond you. There’s energy around us all the time that’s as responsible for the music that people make as the people who make it are, and the more egotistical control a person puts toward what they do, the less these spirits have of working through the people. When those spirits work, it’s within those elements that are uncontrollable.    You can see spirits on walls that are cracking: You see icons and events going on, and people doing things. This is the unseen world, and this is where it shows through in our world. Because we live in a linear time continuum, if we look at a wall that’s been falling apart for 10 years, and we see faces in it, to our eyes it looks like they’re still. But in a place where they don’t have a relationship with time, that’s the reality. That’s the spirits’ way of connecting with us. If I play guitar in such a way that I’m totally in control, those spirits don’t have a chance to come through; they might have come through in the original thought or conception, but they have no place in the performance of it. If I just grab my guitar and I start jamming the pick into the pickups with a really loud sound, and just putting all the energy I can into it but not actually playing any notes, I’m not responsible for the sound that comes out; the energy that came through me is responsible for the sound that comes out.  By the way, I’m not saying my music comes from the spirits and yours doesn’t; all the crap music everywhere in the world, it all comes from spirits. Crappy music comes from crappy spirits.     It must be satisfying to have nearly completed this major project. All I know is that the six months when I recorded this music was the most productive time of my life, and I’ll always remember it as the first time in my life that I ever felt like I was one with my dreams.       John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer perform with ex-Neu! guitarist Michael Rother at the Knitting Factory on Thursday, August 5.

      Laughing all the way to No 1   ANDREW EATON ON POP  TIME FOR the Festival again, then. Lots of good gigs on, as usual, mainly thanks to T on the Fringe. Go and see the 5,6,7,8s, I say. In case you don’t know, they’re that Japanese all-girl punk band with the "woo hoo, woo hoo hoo" song and will be infinitely more fun than Morrissey. Should you care, I also recommend dEUS, an underrated yet frequently magnificent band from Belgium in the spirit of Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart. Go on, take a chance. It’s the Fringe - and Morrissey and the Streets are sold out anyway.   Meanwhile, below most people’s radar, there is a new festival, Tigerfest, which attempts to resurrect the spirit of the much-missed (by me and about 400 other people) Planet Pop. Planet Pop, if you’re not one of those 400, was a no-budget, indie-to-the-core music event that got crushed to untimely death by the might of T on the Fringe. By which I’m not implying foul play, but those involved know what I’m talking about.   Tigerfest is clearly modelled on Planet Pop because the biggest name on its bill is Half Man Half Biscuit. If T on the Fringe is pop’s Edinburgh International Festival, Tigerfest is its Fringe off the Fringe. I have never heard of half of the bands on its bill, and I get paid to know this stuff. The ones I have heard of, though, are great. The Glasgow band Sluts of Trust - an even mix of the White Stripes and the Darkness whose cause I will continue to champion until someone notices - are performing at the Venue on 9 August. Andrew Montgomery, who used to be in Geneva (the band, not the place, otherwise that would be a wholly irrelevant comment) plays Caledonian Backpackers on 7 August. Your best bet, though, is Edinburgh College of Art on 23 August, where you will find Desc and The Starlets, two of Scottish pop’s best kept secrets. Desc’s songs are dark and creepy. The Starlets are dizzy with romance and hope. They will be perfect together. Visit www.tigerfest. baby-tiger.net for more if you’re interested.   Really, though, there is only one Fringe gig I want to endorse - Gary Le Strange, at the Pod Deco. It’s not strictly a gig, Gary being the winner of last year’s Perrier best newcomer - a comedy award. But something fascinating has happened to Gary since his 2003 show.   Last year’s songs were pitch perfect, savage yet affectionate spoofs of early 1980s pop hits. Prince Charles was Adam Ant’s Prince Charming but with a lyric about cowboys and Princess Diana. Grey was Vienna by Ultravox, except it was about how much Gary liked the colour grey. The beauty was in the way Gary’s songs were only slightly more silly and pretentious than the originals. A year on, I still find myself singing the chorus of Gary’s tribute to Rudolf Nureyev - it goes "Ballerina! Ballerina!" - and wondering which Soft Cell album it was on. I had a nagging worry about Polaroid Suitcase, though: what is the point of spoofing bands from 20 years ago? And doesn’t this joke stop being funny quite quickly? Thankfully, my doubts were laid to rest this week by the arrival in the post of Gary’s new album, Face Academy.   And here’s what’s fascinating. From merely being a brilliantly observed synthpop spoof, Gary Le Strange has found his own voice. Sure, you can hear traces of Bowie when he croons nonsense like "Daddy loves his chimney face, I heard it on the news", or Marc Almond on a ridiculous electro stomp called Seedy Pimp ("Do you like German nurses with fat hairy necks?"), but where once you could easily spot the Gary Numan song, or the David Sylvian song, now they blend together into a terrifying Adam-Numan-Sylvian-ABC-Duranesque monster. What does it sound like? It sounds like Gary Le Strange. You can actually picture him as a real pop star.   He’d make a great pop star too. "We are warriors and fashion is our weapon," he chants on opening track Warriors of Style ("weapon", by the way, is pronounced "weapurh-hurrrrn!!!"). Gary’s manifesto is roughly this - boys should wear make up, girls suits (even in bed), and the most important thing you could possibly do with your life is get in the top ten. Number one is not enough, in fact: "This record’s gonna get to number nought!" The joke, of course, is that Gary is not a pop star at all but a sad, unbelievably deluded, 32-year-old loser. Well, call me crazy, but I find that inspiring. As Justin Hawkins and Jarvis Cocker have proved, there’s room for 30-something weirdos in the charts. And Face Academy is actually a good pop album. When was the last time you heard an album with songs about what it’s like to be a car, owning a robot and a photocopier that takes over the world? Or a love song with the line: "Like Jocky Wilson and Darth Vader combined she threw a treble 20 into my mind."   The campaign starts here. Gary Le Strange will have a number one hit. He shall go to the ball. Oh yes.

      On Sunday night the dream of every leather pants lover came to fruition, as the masters of tight trousers, Justin Hawkins and Chad Kroeger were caught schmoozing at the Much Music Video Awards. Although surrounded by girls at the MMVA after-party, Kroeger seemed to enjoy getting close with the Darkness' lead singer, whispering sweet nothings in his ear, or possibly planning the latest rock star fashions.

      Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante is currently on a six-month hiatus from the Peppers. Usually when musicians take a break from their busy touring, recording and promoting schedules, it's to relax. Not in Frusciante's case. As we've already reported, the Peppers guitarist has decided instead to record six albums and release one per month for the next six months.  The first album in the series, Will To Death, was released on June 22. On August 10 Frusciante will release the second album, Ataxia: Automatic Writing, which consists of five songs and runs for about 44 minutes.  Ataxia: Automatic Writing is a joint effort between Frusciante, Josh Klinghoffer of Bicycle Thief and Fugazi's Joe Lally. Frusciante met Fugazi in 1999.  "[Fugazi] were my favourite band in the world and I was going to see them play live as much as possible," Frusciante said in a statement. "I am lucky to have seen them as much as I have. They have had a hugely positive effect on me, both as a musician and as a person."  Frusciante had performed a couple of shows in LA with Klinghoffer and the two musicians soon asked Lally to play with them. They called themselves Ataxia and began writing and recording together.  "We were feeling very much like the music was playing us. There is this feeling that often comes when playing music with people which is that music is just there and we, as musicians, are sucked into its swirling energy," said Frusciante. "That is what it felt like, and we felt so good about the songs that had resulted from these improvisations that we decided to book studio time."  Ataxia spent four days recording 90 minutes of music, recording everything live in the studio with most of the lead vocals recorded with basic tracks. Frusciante admits that he was not careful with this record, but instead there was "a sense of abandonment and being out of control."  "Basically, the three-week period this music was made in was a very exciting time and I feel like I will always hear that music with the same sense of wonderment I feel now, which is just with a question in my mind of, 'How did this happen?'" he said. "It happened so quickly and I would rate our best moments with some of the most powerful feelings I have ever felt in my life."

      Posted on Thu, Jul. 29, 2004   Schizophrenic solo effort from a Chili Pepper    "Shadows Collide With People," John Frusciante (Warner Brothers Records,   ***  )  Singer Anthony Kiedis and funk master bassist Flea are the two most visible members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but guitarist John Frusciante often adds just the right sounds to flesh out their songs.  This solo album was released earlier this year; and it seems slightly schizophrenic, jumping from genre to genre easily. The problem is that the musicianship is great (Fru/guitars, keys, bass, vocals; John Klinghoffer/ditto; Chili-man Chad Smith/drums, and selected others); but things aren't very distinctive.  The opener ("Carvel") sets the tone with bubbling noises beginning and ending the song. There are also songs that sound like the mellower side of John's main band, and he sings them well. I mention the noise because there is a lot lurking about; one song is nearly all organ squeaks and swirls.  There's even a song with my name as its title, which has a low-key acoustic beginning, and ends without jamming or sound effects; thus, it comes off cooler than most. Before the album's release, I listened to mostly-acoustic sound samples on John's Web site that benefited from the stripped-down treatment. A good quality of these songs is that they lack the whiny or growled vocals that make us cringe.  Fans of modern rock will find a lot to like about this recording, though it occasionally leans into mellow-land and has frequent dips into lyrical psychobabble.

      THIEVES left JUSTIN HAWKINS a rock ’n’ no-roll star by pinching the wheels off his new Jag.   The frontman looked out of Darkness Towers yesterday morning to see his prized £60,000 XK8 up on bricks.   Justin said: “I suppose bricks are perfectly adequate if you just want to park but the wheels are rather essential for driving.   “I can’t help feeling they’ve gone to fuel someone’s crack addiction. I’m really gutted. I feel like weeping.”   Gutted ... Justin behind the wheel  Justin – who headlines the Leeds/Reading Festival with the band this month – wants the original wheels back.   He said: “They are worth a lot of money. I’m willing to offer a very generous reward for any information. Otherwise I won’t be able to do my shopping.”   If I was him I’d be busy checking eBay.   from the sun 5th august 2004

       	Paranormal experts hope to find ghosts in Plymouth ROYAL NAVY GHOSTBUSTERSParanormal researchers are to visit a Royal Navy base to investigate reports that it is haunted by the ghosts of executed prisoners.  Psychics, mediums and investigators will spend the weekend trying to detect spirits at Devonport Naval Base, Plymouth, using seances and sophisticated sensors.   They will focus their attention on the Hangman's Cell, reputed to be where more than 100 men were executed, and the 18th century Master Ropemaker's House.  Ian Addicoat, president of the Paranormal Research Organisation, will accompany the 20-strong team of investigators.  He said: "With the history of the site and the alleged paranormal activity, we should be in for an interesting couple of days.  "If there are ghosts or strange occurrences, we stand a great chance of finding out.  "We will be using scientific equipment, bringing our best investigators and spending two full nights in the active areas."   The team will analyse every sound and movement they record at Devonport, the largest naval base in western Europe, and present their findings to the Navy.

      seems we go through these big cat stories about this time every year. suddenly the news is full of big cat tales; then the subject fades away again..until next year. it won't go away. this time it's made it to national geographic website  "Leopards are Prowling Britain, Survey Suggests  James Owen in England for National Geographic News June 3, 2004 If it is true that big cats haven't lived wild in the U.K. for 2,000 years, then, judging from the results of a new survey, a lot of large house cats now roam the British countryside.   Organized by British Big Cats Society (BBCS), the nationwide survey recorded 2,052 unconfirmed sightings of big cats in just 15 months, between January 2003 and March of this year.   The sighting counts averaged four each day. Two-thirds of the sightings involved large black animals resembling melanistic leopards, also known as panthers. If all these sightings had been confirmed, it would mean the U.K.'s leopard population now rivals that of the Kashmir region of the Indian subcontinent.    The survey was compiled with the help of farmers, police officers, and other observers. The BBCS, based near Plymouth, England, says, "There is little doubt that big cats are roaming Britain."   Besides leopards, the society claims Britain may also be home to wild pumas and other exotic felines such as lynx and caracals that have either escaped from or been deliberately released from zoos and private collections. Officially, the last large cat living in Britain was the northern lynx some 2,000 years ago.   The new data include reports of five attacks on horses, more than 30 sheep-kill incidents, and several discoveries of paw prints. Southwest and southeast England had the highest percentage of reported sightings.   Farmers were among the main contributors to the study. The National Farmers' Union, which represents farmers in England and Wales, had encouraged its members to become the "eyes and ears" of the countryside for the BBCS.   "They have had a lot of unexplained livestock kills and attacks," said British Big Cats Society founder Danny Bamping. "These involved not just sheep but goats, chickens, and horses. Farmers know what sort of damage foxes or dogs can cause, and many of them have seen these cats."  "

      12:00 - 31 May 2004  Paranormal investigators who spent two nights at Devonport Dockyard have reported sudden temperature drops and ghostly presences in the hangman's cell and are to analyse 'very good' photographic evidence. The team of 10 'ghostbusters' said they believe there is paranormal activity at the Dockyard, after logging several unexplained phenomenon during their weekend vigil.Their investi Their investigation focused on the hangman's cell, where 141 French prisoners-of-war were said to have been executed, as well at the 18th-century Master Ropemaker's House. The cell contains what is believed to be the only remaining working gallows in Britain, and was reportedly the scene of numerous executions during the Napoleonic Wars. The team used night vision cameras to record their investigation and belive they may have captured images of 'orbs' and 'cobwebs' that appeared during the night. Investigators are particularly excited because the 'orbs' of light appeared when investigators tried to communicate with the ghostly presences. When the team was in the hangman's cell, they tried to communicate with the spirits but initially received no response. But realising that the presences may be from the executed French prisoners, they tried speaking to them in French and the 'orbs' appeared above investigator Ian Addicoat's head. The team also reported sudden drops in temperature and unusual electromagnetic field readings. They will submit a report about their findings to the Royal Navy in the next few days and have already said they would like to go back for another monitoring session. One of the team, Barbara Jones, from Abercynon, South Wales, said they finished their vigil at 5am yesterday. She said the team of 10 all believed 'beyond any degree of doubt' that they had detected paranormal activity at the base. The hangman's cell was paranormally 'very active', particularly below the hatch through which those hanged were dropped. There were changes in temperature in the cell, she said. Underneath the hatch they had picked up activity relating to 'one particular person'. She said she could 'quite understand' reports of police and security staff being 'spooked' patrolling in the area and 'legging it'. Although they did not see any ghosts, they had 'very good' photographic evidence, yet to be analysed, which had them 'jumping up and down'. "It has been very interesting, and there are many areas on the base which my team would like to come back and help with," she added. The paranormal researchers brought toys and blackboards for child ghosts to play with. They also set up objects, including a made-up bed, balls, marbles and furniture in an attempt to detect poltergeists. In the past, base staff reported sightings of a young girl in Victorian costume and a bearded sailor in the building.More News|Back

We hit that danger zone last week when Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins launched a perfectly good string of profanities in the direction of a club patron in Los Angeles, only to be cowed into apologizing by do-gooders who informed him that the young lady was actually a fan who won a contest sponsored by a British magazine and not a dirty, stinking journalist from said paper.

      http://www.earthmeasure.com/   quote their homepage:   "NATIVE AMERICAN GEOMETRY is a physical, proportional geometry that originates from the simple circle. A growing body of architectural and iconographic evidence from Native America suggests it was a relatively common tradition that has been practiced for at least two thousand years. This is the same type of geometry that was discovered and developed by the ancestors of many peoples in many places, from China to the Mediterranean Basin to the British Isles. Currently, it resides among the logo designers of Madison Avenue. Generally, it maintains a similar methodological structure to the Middle Eastern tradition of classical geometry that is limited to operations carried out by the compass and straightedge, or two sticks and a rope."

      some may believe these circles aren't man made.  this website is hosted by one of the believers in paranormal creation of crop circles.    to contrary that. i have seen people making these crop circles. i lived right next to stone henge. i went and tested out the odd phenomena that was cited as occurring in the circles. like mobile phones not working. i stood in the middle of the crop circles and carried on chatting on my mobile to friends and family  and the reception was excellent. that's just one example.   i'll leave it at that. people can get rather nasty when they hear things that contradict their beliefs. and they have while i was at the circles. minding my own business, until they chose to invade my space and preach to me.    if you want to believe you will   just one more thing. the people that make these made one for Weetabix near Avebury.   the photographers of crop circles make money. the land owner makes money. the crop circle postcard, calendar, book sellers make money, Weetabix makes money., and so on.

I couldn't work out if they were for real or fuckin' taking the piss or what their deal was.  Now I'm starting to think they're pretty serious. It seems they pick up a lot of all different rock images that are memorable over the years and throw it in there consciously. In all honesty I think if you're doing something original and having a good time doing it and people enjoy it, then it's good."  (from guitarist magazine july 2004)

      Filly Loo, Ashmore, Dorset. A celebration of the longest day, held on the nearest Friday,when villagers dance beside this singular village pond (it is high on the chalk). The Hambledon Hopstep Band play and call from a cart decorated in greenery to the crowd, dancing in the street. A Green Man arrives in a procession and takes part in the first dance to start the evening. There are display dances followed by public dancing, then at dusk, the celebrations reach their climax with the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance. This is a torchlit procession with six antlered deer-men and four other costumed characters: a Maid Marion, a bowman, a hobby horse and a fool. The procession and dance is accompanied by a haunting solo melody in a minor key which is very atmospheric. The celebration finishes with the torches in the ground around the pond and everyone holding hands around the pond for the last dance.

      As the last glimmers of the setting sun strike the heather and gorse of the now still Cornish Moors, orange glimmers of light flicker; fire beacons blaze forth from hilltops from Lands End in the far South West to Kithill on the Cornwall Devon border.  .  These bonfires are a celebration of the Summer , with the sun at strongest, and are lit the night after the Summer Solstice. Though no one is really sure they are believed to be pagan in origin.   .  The ceremony itself is spoken in Cornish, it climaxes with the Lady of the Flowers casting into the now roaring flames a bunch of herbs, both good herbs, those believed to have medicinal qualities, along with bad, those that are poisonous.

      keening   Irish: caoineadh   In Ireland, the invention of keening is attributed to the goddess Brigit, daughter of the Dagda. Her son Ruadan mac Bres was killed by the smith Goibniu for being a spy. He was pierced by a spear in front of her, and she let out the first keening heard in Ireland. After Brigid, all fairy women--bean sidhe--would keen for the dead in a like manner, especially those with ties to mortal families.   Keening is not simply wailing, though--it is a controlled use of high-pitched singing of laments performed by women who are trained in this art. These women are actually professionals, paid (usually in food and drink) to attend the wake.   Keening cannot be performed until the wake, when the soul is thought to have finally left the body. To sing while the soul may still be present would allert the hounds of hell, who might sweep down and grab the soul. This, of course, relates back to the pan-European concept of the Wild Hunt.   In the seventeenth century, the Catholic Church sought to ban keening, viewing it as pagan and undigified. While it was certainly pagan (though much folk custom usually is, if one can think of pagan as meaning an earth-based practice), it was not undignified.   From all reports, the practice of keening is dying out, as are most ancient customs these days.   (from jones encyclopedia)

      In Mull and Tiree islands in Scotland, she is said to have praeternaturally long breasts, which are in the way as she stoops at her washing. She throws them over her shoulders, and they hang down her back. Whoever sees her must not turn away, but steal up behind and endeavour to approach her unawares. When he is near enough he is to catch one of her breasts, and, putting it to his mouth, calls herself to witness that she is his first nursing or foster-mother. She answers that he has need of that being the case, and will then communicate whatever knowledge he desires. If she says the shirt she is washing is that of an enemy he allows the washing to go on, and that man's death follows; if it be that of her captor or any of his friends, she is put a stop to. She can also be caught and mastered and made to communicate her information at the point of a sword.

      "In 1347, the Bubonic Plague began to spread across Europe. For more than thirty years it killed without warning -- sending more than forty percent of the population to the infernos of the funeral pyres. It became known as the "Black" plague because within four days of contracting the disease, the victim would die and the corpse would quickly turn black. Most unsavory.   The art of that period took a decided turn toward the dark. Superstition and beliefs in the evil supernatural raged like the fires of the burning dead. This was reflected in nearly all of the illustrations and woodblock prints of the late Gothic period. The dark condition of mankind's spirit echoed the rigid stems, pointed terminals and overall blackness of the scribe's "Textura" lettering -- called "Black Letter" which today is sometimes mislabeled "Old English."   It is no surprise therefore that the art and motif of "Halloween" quite often reflects the dark styles of the mid-1300s. Images like the shrouded grim reaper, the scythe, and skeletons all have their origins in the art of the Black Plague. "  (from graphic-design.com)  most interesting looking at it in graphic design terms, and via the history of graphic design. afterall it is but an image.

      1) this is all being done for economic purposes not religious, really. 2) Having a War is a great way to ensure your name gets in all the history books. And it'll probably say in them, that you were a hero.

      Jack Van Impe Question Of The Week  Do you think President Bush, a Christian man, believes or knows he's involved with prophetic events concerning the Middle East and the final battle between good and evil?  Jack Van Impe responds:  First of all, Billy Graham led George W. Bush Jr. to the Lord Jesus Christ when he visited the White House. President Bush has attended many of Billy Graham's crusades and during those crusades, Billy Graham always preaches once or twice on Christ's return and all the prophetical signs.  Secondly, Rexella and I were in the home of President Bush Senior. What a great time we had with his wife Barbara, in fact, she's even written us four personal letters and we have them hanging up in our memorabilia room. We gave her the message on video, "The Coming War with Russia" and many of our books to share with her husband, George Bush Sr. Of course, I now have sent the video, "Jerusalem: War or Peace" to all the leaders of our nation.  A teacher from Texas who lives down the street from the Bush's and is a personal friend to them, asked me to come to Texas so I could personally hand him a copy. I said I couldn't because I'm just swamped with work to do, so she said she'd personally see that he gets a copy.  I know that he as seen this video, "Jerusalem: War or Peace". His brother in Florida, Jeb Bush, has seen it because he wrote me the most heartfelt letter. So, yes, I think George W. knows that he's destined for this final hour in prophetic history.

      Causes of death of philosophers  'Gentlemen, it is a fact that every philosopher of eminence for the last two centuries has either been murdered, or, at the least, been very near it, insomuch that if a man calls himself a philosopher, and never had his life attempted, rest assured there is nothing in him; and against Locke's philosophy in particular, I think it is an unanswerable objection (if we needed any) that, although he carried his throat about him in this world for seventy-two years, no man ever condescended to cut it.' Thomas de Quincey, 'Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts' (quotation supplied by Kent Bach)   These lists, started by Stiv Fleishman, contain many new and revised entries, suggested by many other philosophers and added by D. H. Mellor, to whom further suggestions should be sent.  (from www.dar.cam.ac.uk)

      What really ticks me off about this one, is why can't people just accept that humans are capable of doing things that are amazing and brilliant; and don't need aliens to come down and show then how to do it.  Yes, we'd be Chimps still if it weren't for the visiting aliens in the stone age. Sure. Whatever.  Those stone age pictographs are of aliens, spacecrafts, and people in spacesuits. Those Nazca lines in Peru are alien landing strips or messages to outerspace...it goes on and on...fantasy... off to watch Star Trek. Then maybe X-Files. It's all real what you see on the TV you know.

      NDE's. " Professor David Fontana, from the University of Minho, Portugal, Points out that in many cases of NDEs, the people involved point out events that were new to them, including medical techniques that they could have had no possible memory of. An experiment to support his theory was conducted on some volunteers. They were placed in a chamber, and given a reduced oxygen supply. The results showed that the volunteers became mentally and physically impaired, their memory suffered considerably, and apart from a few who reported hallucinations, none claimed to"  just a wee excerpt. lord knows where the rest of the article goes there at the end..it dies off i guess :P it just isn't finished n the site.  but what i find amazing is people willingly allowed these experiments to be conducted on them? "oh sure doc, you can stop me getting oxygen until i have a near death experience..."  I'll pass on that one thanks!

      There are many various, non-commercial organizations in the world who proclaim, as a rule, humanitarian goals and aid for those who need help. In the US alone there are more than a million such organizations who harness nearly 500 billion dollars a year. Let's reemphasize, for humanitarian purposes. At the same time, judging by official statistics, more than 11% of them are either different ethnic or religious groups - Jewish and Moslem, Catholic and Protestant, Greek, German, Russian and many, many others.  It is interesting to examine their activities.  So as not to offend good people, of whom there are many, let's invent a virtual non-profit and call it "Feeding Canadian Children." It, we shall assume, is involved with the problems of the malnutrition of children in Canada. Right away we will notice: it is unjust, that all of the malnourished children in the world are divided into Canadian and the rest, that is, if a child is going hungry in Buffalo, literally 100 meters from the Canadian border with the US, then this is no longer our concern's problem, and if compassionate people from our virtual organization help the American children, then they will violate Canadian laws and may lose their operating license for an expenditure of funds for no purpose.  Of course, our example is fiction, but there are thousands of borders in the world where this situation, alas, exists in actual fact. Some of them are - the Mexican-American, Palestinian-Israeli, Albanian-Italian and the many others.  Matters are even worse with the international activity of our non-existent non-profit. Let's imagine a mythical scene - there is hunger in the US, but not in Canada. A small group of Canadian families live in Buffalo and "Feeding Canadian Children" from the best of motives is sending food to them and their children. Is it of interest how the neighbors of the Canadian families would like it, where children are still hungry only because they are not Canadians? After some time, the newspapers write about an outburst of anti-Canadian feelings in Buffalo. And how new waves of money, on the one hand, already are flying there into the eye of the political hurricane, and on the other - the hatred, creating the next hot spot on planet Earth. Someone may say: Hunger and circumstances are to blame. But if our non-profit were to be called "Feeding the Children" instead of "Feeding Canadian Children" and helped all the children in the famished region, then there wouldn't even be a problem.  Let's try to prove a rather drastic assertion - any money allocated on a national, ethnic or religious basis inflames ethnic or national discord and, ultimately, always feeds war.  Let's take an example from real life. A brutal example. In 2002, Canadian Jewish organizations collected $530,000 for financing the armed protection of kindergartens and schools in Israel. Undoubtedly a noble goal: Children need to be protected under the conditions of barbarous terrorism. But what, in essence, happened?  A military organization engage in defense received the money. People who risk their lives every day and, therefore, receive a comparatively high salary work here. Let's emphasize, under the conditions of a deep economic recession and inflation of the national currency. It is extremely difficult to find other work with such a salary.  This organization's budget fully depends on the level of tension in the region: the higher the tension - the greater the income and the more numerous the ranks of the security guards. There can be only one conclusion: The organization willingly or unwillingly is interested in maintaining the tension.  This is typical for any organization, for any system. Once created, any organization will strive for its preservation and even expansion. There are no people in the world who would rejoice in the fact that their labor, peaceful or warlike, suddenly became unnecessary.  It is absolutely that very same scene in Palestine. The money collected as Moslem donations under all sorts of pretexts and humanitarian slogans, in the final analysis accumulates in the extremist structures. The results are well known.  Circumstances are no better in the Christian world, too. The money, having received the names of the Catholics or the Protestants, feeds the military structures in Belfast. And what is interesting is the activity of the organizations who finance extremism indirectly is not prohibited, but even, to the contrary, encouraged and partly financed by governments. In North America this is called the financing of national and ethnic communities.  Charles Aznavour, the legendary French singer of Armenian origin, brought donations of rich Franco-Armenian society to Armenia. One may prove with mathematical precision how this money was turned into cannon and tanks for the Armenian-Azerbaijani war in Nagorno-Karabakh. Similar scenarios are operating in the Turkish-Kurdish, Greco-Turkish, Serb-Croat, Georgian-Abkhazian, Pakistani-Indian and other hot spots of the planet.  This bitter experience and sound logic suggest that international financial activity of any religiously or ethnically slanted organizations should be prohibited or strictly limited to local requirements. No fleeting apparent advantage from such organizations can be compared with the dissension and hatred of religious and national groups which arise as a result of just such an addressed makeup of "ours" as distinct from "theirs."  Undoubtedly, the ideas of "national customs," "precepts of the fathers," and "our faith" exist and in part are needed psychologically. But their value cannot even be compared with the value of the lives of hundreds of thousands of people - the victims of the conflicts that rage because of faith and ethnic affiliation. For the sake of those people, the life of whom can still be saved today, we should repudiate the protrusion of personal backgrounds or religious views.  Modern societies and laws are not perfect, and, while the worldwide community has not reached a single opinion regarding this global problem, we urge the following of several simple rules.  Don't donate money under any circumstances   	 to Protestant religious organizations, inasmuch as religious isolation is being emphasized.   	 to Catholic organizations - for the very same reasons. A combination with ethnic symbols, for example with Irish, is especially dangerous.   	 Buddhist organizations - for the very same reasons. A combination with caste symbols is especially dangerous.   	 Orthodox organizations.   	 Jewish organizations. Combining religion and nationality, these organizations directly or indirectly feed the most dangerous breeding ground of tension.   	 Moslem organizations - neither in any circumstances nor of any type. Islam, being in a stormy, aggressive stage of its development, feeds many of the planet's hot spots.   	 Societies which have a feature of a state in the name. "American Baptists" or the "Canadian Brotherhood" or the "German Friends." Emphasizing state membership, these organizations willingly or unwillingly impart to their activity a narrowly directed nature, which coincides with the direction of ethnic conflicts.   	 Ethnic societies. Any society which bears an ethnic feature engenders dissension. For example, the "Greek Drug Addicts Anonymous Association" clearly infringes on non-Greeks. Geographic attachment should not coincide with political and ethnic names. For example, the "Athens Society" does not coincide with any kind of ethnic name.  The name and activity of a social organization should be outside of or directed against the lines of force of religious and ethnic conflicts.  The habit of emphasizing one's nationality or religious affiliation separates us better than any walls. For example, even such an organization as the "Red Cross" is unable to help the sick confirmed Moslem: it can affect his faith. Cases are well known when the ill or injured have refused to accept the aid of doctors and coworkers of the "Red Cross" or "Magen David Adom" only because these were not representatives of the "Red Crescent." And they were dying. The thought was unbearable to them that the hands a non-Moslem touch them and that the blood of non-believers get into their veins.  One may say that the "Red Cross" operates mainly in Christian countries. But people also live in these countries who belong to other faiths. Is it possible special branches of the "Red Crescent" or "Magen David Adom" need to open for them? And how is it to be with the Buddhists if they suddenly want to conduct business only with their own religiously slanted institution that provides aid? An absurd situation. In practice it is resolved simply time and again: the Christian or any other religious coloration needs to be removed from this peaceful and philanthropic organization.  And even in Chechnya itself, judging by media reports, the activity of the "Red Cross" has caused a violent protest. How, it is said, is like this: a Christian organization is operating in a Moslem country! Will this help the establishment of peace in the Caucasus?  That very same "Red Cross" offered aid to 20,000 Palestinian families in August 2002. But to whom? Mainly in Hebron and mainly to Arab Christians, because for a Moslem family to accept such aid means to disgrace oneself . Such is the reality.  It is curious that none of the "Red Cross" management, and also of the "Red Crescent" and "Magen David Adom" have attempted ever and anywhere objectively and critically to assess the prevalent situation. On the other hand, judging by the names of these organizations, which are identical in the sort of their activity, everything is done in order to emphasize their religious slant. They let the religious fanatics push them around, lining up under their views and beliefs. So, they say, it is easier to help people while not arousing their religious feelings. And no one has had the thought that in that way interfaith dissension is ever more strengthened. No one has even had a timid desire to unify the worldwide structures created for rendering aid under a common flag, on which would be written that we first of all are people, and only afterwards all the rest.  Yes, we live in a world, divided into countries and religious faiths. But if we can make steps today toward unification, what is preventing us?  We have gotten used to living, emphasizing and proclaiming our own national backgrounds, and our own faith, and time and again imposing on those around us our own spiritual values. In the best case - remaining aloof from the spiritual values of other peoples and thereby arousing them willy-nilly. New times demand from us new standards of behavior - to keep ours to ourselves. Because, both beliefs and national biases are very personal things.  The question may arise: how then for all that can there be new traditions in an old tradition world? How, let's assume, is the "Red Cross" to be named correctly? There are no simple answers. And there cannot be. The forces of many people are needed, a "brain storm" is needed and philosophers, and historians, and politicians.  There already are the first sprouts of new traditions. It is no accident that they emerged just today. The worldwide economy inexorably is moving toward universal integration. Toward globalization. The European Union, a contemplated common North and South American trade zone, ASEAN in the East, and an economic association of African countries which is being created testify to the fact that economic laws are sweeping away national borders. And this leads to definitive shifts in people's perception, in their notions of world order.  Therefore, organizations also have appeared which are not ethnically slanted, which stand outside the lines of force of international and religious conflicts. They serve global purposes. For example, Green Peace, extremely active politically, but maintaining at the same time ethnic neutrality.  Unfortunately, there still are few such organizations. Still fewer are those groups who are not just neutral, but actively resist nationalism. One of them is "New Tradition." We invite everyone to participate in it. With financing, voluntary activity, even with ordinary empathy you will help make a step ahead, to break through the ancient burden of evil's traditions.  Everyone has his own unique route to it. Some arrive via politics, some via history, and some via music or mathematics. This route is the most precious that we have, and it is a new tradition, because others will come behind you.

      A scythe is an agricultural tool not a weapon, and looks nothing like the buffy thing which is so much an axe with a stake at the end of it. that's fantasy for you.  Though I can see mediaeval peasant using anything...like a real scythe. But I'm not an expert in that, so that's why I'm doing this experiment in the first place.  Now onto scythe's and the iconic image of death with a sickle or scythe...hmmm...what's the difference? Surely that's an agricultural society's image of death.  The Vikings, those raiders, now there's the axe wielders for you.

      realised it was a scythe afterall on buffy, even though Willow was looking at axes; so went to scythes. laughed because one of top ones I got was "History of the Lawnmower" Getting closer. Beheading grass, rather than people though.  onward I go.  big brother is getting tedious. Z.Z   Wondering why BB producers or anyone are allowing Victor to stay in the house when he is obviously reading to blow at anytime, or just to show off how tough he is. Same goes for Jason actually.   Will they still provide their inmates with booze? Such a bad idea giving alcohol to people that become aggressive when drunk.

      watching Buffy tonight, the last series. seen it all before, so was noticing other little things. noticed this before in the first buffy's~that they manage to get all this occult info on the internet. what database are the using?!! this episode Willow was looking at a website with the title "History of Axes"; so I thought I'd see what a search for that came spewed up. Not much at all like that.  But some odd bits and pieces. This one I thought was very a very weird story. I thought it was an ancient find, because that's what the rest of the stuff I was getting was.  But, nope, it's a fairly new tale, 2004, about an Italian getting beheaded. Or more about his body being found without a head.

      COPS INVESTIGATE JASON DEATH THREATS  Jun 18 2004  By Andy Rudd    POLICE yesterday launched an investigation into yesterday's drunken brawl in whichBig Brother contestants threatened to kill each other.  Officers were called in just three-and-a-half hours after Michelle and Emma made a surprise return to the house from their secret bedsit.  Clashes broke out between Jason and Marco, Emma and Victor, and Vanessa and Nadia after a food fight erupted into violence.  Police said yesterday: "Following a number of calls from members of the public regarding an alleged incident in the Big Brother house last night, Herts Constabulary can confirm it will be obtaining a videotape of the incident.  "Officers are currently liaising with members of the Big Brother production team to see what further action needs to be taken."  Fans called for the show to be axed after the violent row caused Channel 4 to pull the plug on it for the first time in its history.  The situation came to a head around 1.30am. Victor had overturned a table and pushed Nadia while other housemates threw trays and plates.  Victor was held back by Stuart and Jason while Dan carried away a kicking and screaming Emma. Victor had threatened to "f*****g smack" Emma in the face while she in turn said she would "f*****g kill" the self-proclaimed gangster.  Jason flew off the handle when gay Marco danced in front of him. Jason told Marco: "You come in my face and do that again, I'll f*****g kill you. I'll knock you out. Don't you dare ever dance in my face - I'll take your head off, end of story."  Off-camera, it was alleged Vanessa had pushed Nadia in the bathroom, and Big Brother pulled the plug and sent in security after Shell collapsed in tears.  C4's digital channel E4 cut the live feed from the house from 2am to 3am and two police officers arrived at 3am to investigate.  Leaving Elstree Studios, one security guard said: "Big Brother is in meltdown - serious, serious trouble. For the first time there was the real possibility of someone getting hurt. Victor showed he was a dangerous man who is more than capable of violence. He should not be around other people in a confined area and they've made a big mistake letting him in."  The explosive row left the house wrecked.  Yesterday Victor was locked in the diary room for more than an hour. On his release Emma was ordered back into the bedsit.  Victor revealed he will walk out of the house but only after Emma does. He said: "No offence to your friend, but I'll stick around till your friend disappears. And then once she's gone, I'm packing my stuff and I'm going as well."  Producers took advice from psychiatrists. They allowed the housemates to sleep in and gave them cigarettes to try to ease tension.  But angry fans used an internet site to accuse the show's bosses of orchestrating the situation.  One wrote: "I blame BB as they knew this was going to happen since they supplied booze."  A spokesman for Big Brother later said: "The production team has been talking to all housemates individually over the course of today.  "They will be encouraging the housemates to work through their issues as a group.  "If they do not feel this is feasible they will consider an alternative course of action."  (from the mirror)  me, i knew Victor was trouble when he started talking about US gangstas, and knew the names of the guns, in a conversation with Stuart. Or should I say when he was ranting on nonsensically to Stuart. Not really  much of a conversationalist that Victor. Just talls to people. He even rants to the walls when everyone else has gone to bed. Looks like he could use some sedation there.  As far as Jason, I figured he was trouble when he was getting Dan to put lotion on his back, and even more so when he told Ahmed to go yell at Marco. Why Ahmed followed his "orders" I can't figure out, except a desperation to fit in.  Alpha males they keep calling them? Please, they're too childish for that. Dan might be the real Alpha male in that hell hole.

      Julian cope certainly has big balls.  I mean calling the druids a bunch of elite control freaks. Well, tell it like it is Julian!  Many times have I wondered why they alone get special treatment when it comes to Stonhenge. Really why? Does it belong to them? I lived in the Stonehenge Park area, and they had preferential treatment over residents of the area? Doesn't make sense does it?

      Romancing the stones   Julian Cope may well be the only antiquarian researcher to have appeared on Top of the Pops while stoned on acid. He talks to John Vidal about why we venerate landscape, the politics of heritage, shamanism, and the prehistoric nature of football worship   Wednesday June 16, 2004 The Guardian     Julian Cope, a middle-aged man wearing a baseball cap, is sitting under a great oak at Avebury, one of Britain's finest megalithic sites, holding forth on what makes a place hallowed. There are, he says, tens of thousands of stone circles, dolmans, amphitheatres and monuments, but these are mere pointers. "The sacred landscape is everywhere," he says. "Britain's ancientness shocks me. It's all there, just below the surface. You can peel it away like the skin of an onion."   Cope is an expert on stone circles, but he's not your average antiquarian researcher. Rock star, self-styled shaman and goddess worshipper, his conversation roams from druids ("an elite bunch of control freaks") to planning policy (he calls for a new era of megalith-building in Britain).One minute he is learnedly discussing alignments of stones with a passer-by, the next he's leaping around imitating a horned God. The heritage industry, environmentalism, prehistoric culture and the goalkeeper-as-shaman are all on his idiosyncratic agenda.   Places can be both modern and sacred, he ruminates. The best examples are Avebury, Stonehenge, and especially Glastonbury, where people today still go to from the city in an updated version of western worship. But the examples are not exclusively ancient. St Paul's cathedral in London is sacred - though the technological age, embodied in the modern city buildings that surround it and dominate it, has sapped some of its power. The Twin Towers of New York, Cope argues, represented a sacred landscape for Americans. Each culture, he suggests, can make its own temples.   Cope is singular. He was the lead singer of post-punk indie band, The Teardrop Explodes, who shone brilliantly for a couple of amphetamine-fuelled years in the early 1980s. He became a cult solo rocker, and author of two critically-acclaimed volumes of autobiography. He may, too, be the only bona fide antiquarian researcher to have performed on Top of the Pops while on acid, and to have posed naked (for an album cover) beneath the shell of a giant turtle.   More recently, he gave two talks at the British Museum about the norse divinity Odin - an occasion noted for his appearance in five-inch platform shoes and the fact that his hairspray forced the evacuation of the building after setting off fire alarms.   He plays the fool, but he certainly isn't one. Four years ago, his eight-year study of the ancient sites of Britain, The Modern Antiquarian, did as much as a thousand archaeologists and academics to drag late-prehistoric megalithic cultural studies into the present. It sold more than 40,000 copies in hardback and won the respect of many of Britain's leading researchers. What impressed the academics was not just the fact that, unlike them, he had the time and money to visit almost every one of the hundreds of sites that litter Britain, but that the infectious enthusiasm and knowledge of this errant, sometimes absurd, genius was filled with the kind of insights that could never come from the mainstream.   Cope may follow a long and honourable line of 18th- and 19th-century amateur antiquarians who meticulously recorded ancient sites and tried to interpret pre-history, but his take is equally informed by rock 'n' roll, and his experience of wildness and shamanism.   The megalith builders, he says, were these islands' first settlers, and humanity's first known monument builders. Their urge to mark the environment they lived in with monuments came out of reverence for the sun and the moon, but also, he says, from the deep and abiding urge to make human significance from land scape - something which, he says, still deeply informs the British, who venerate both landscape and the past more than in any other country in Europe.   "The stones and circles of Britain are absolutely central to who we are today," he says. "They have defined and shaped our society. Our understanding of them makes us who we are. It shapes us, enriches our culture, and allows us to reflect on our own obsessions."   A few weeks ago, he visited the small Nine Ladies stone circle in the Peak District national park, just a few hundred yards from where a quarry company plans to extract millions of tonnes of stone. On one level, he says, he was shocked by the threatened disturbance and the "fucked up" quarriers; but he was also heartened by the intuitive defence of the stones by a group of protesters who have been camped in the woods nearby for more than three years.   Cope, an evironmentalist, is no stranger to protest, notably at the Newbury bypass, where he donned the white hats of the roadbuilders and started ordering around the security guards. But the Nine Ladies protest at Stanton Lees also made him think about how the British have, almost uniquely, held on to their past. He has just finished a massive book on the ancient cultures of Europe, visiting more than 400 sites - from the temple circles of Ireland to the stone boats of Scandinavia and the megaliths of Armenia and the Mediterranean. He found many in a sorry state, un appreciated or even knocked down. "We dont know how blessed we are with our monuments," he says. "In some places in Iberia, you have to wade through human excrement to reach rock-cut tombs." Moreover, there is little study being done. Even though the earliest neolithic settlers [in Crete] were the originators of the Greek myths, little is known about them.   The significance of the stones in Britain, he suggets, is not dissimilar to what it was thousands of years ago. "The Peak District national park is now a vast sanctuary for the hundreds of thousands of people who live near it, just as in the past the megalith builders turned the whole area into a huge limestone sanctuary reflecting the monumental landscape."   We should, he says, think differently about landscape today, not be so precious about monuments, and think about using it to reflect our own age and obsessions.   "My idea of beauty is first based on what I know about it, and then on what it looks like," Cope says. "Perhaps we should set windfarms up in lines or in circles. Let's be monumental about them." Giant sculptures such as the Angel of the North come, he says, from the same urge to give meaning to place.   The heritage conservation industry is, he suggests, overprotective. He would see nothing wrong with people today re-erecting fallen monuments, or even re-arranging the stones, just as the megalith builders themselves thought nothing about dismantling some structures, carting them off to make new monuments and changing their significance according to the needs of the times.   He deplores the kind of insensitive roadbuilding seen at Stonehenge or Newbury, which can carelessly destroy ancient landscapes, yet he is no lover of the government's obsessive protectionism that lists up to 400,000 buildings and preserves landscapes in aspic as some kind of romanticisation. "Often, it's for no other reason than that something is old," he says. "That's got to be total bullshit. Something is only beautiful because of what it stands for. Some of our destroyed castles are symbolic of terrible things, and are a mess. Why preserve the Byker estate in Newcastle? It's a monument to suffering."   One of the roles of the modern rock star, he suggests, is to be the shaman in society, opening the doors of the "underground". "It's as close to the shaman's contribution in prehistoric society as you can possibly get," he argues. "The shaman beating on the rotten log in Cheddar Gorge would have used the stack of speakers today. I see myself as a shaman. We have this idea that the shaman was insane, but I think he filtered through all society. You have always have to have people howling at the moon."   We are much closer to our ancient roots than we might think, he says. "Jim Morrison was probably the first to recognise the role of the rock 'n' roller as shaman," Cope says. "It was the Doors' epics, such as The End and When the Music's Over, that tipped the audience into the magical netherworld of ritual death and resurrection. Even a really shit band in a youth club has a barbarian eloquence. It's a religion substitute."   He sees echoes of prehistory cultures in everything. "Look at football worship," he says. "All those people gathered in an unroofed stadium [is] not unlike what must have gone on in pagan sanctuaries. The goalkeeper is the ultimate shaman, guarding the gates to the underground, wearing the No 1 jersey in a different colour and not seeming to be part of the team. We've never lost it. Modern beliefs that we are at the tail end of a culture that is killing itself is just bollocks."   What of today's archaeologists, picking away at our past? "They're like fucking mystics," he says. He loves and respects them, but cannot help winding them up. "I went down to one site wearing my Archbishop Makarios hat. 'I'm here to declaim loudly,' I said. 'You spend 16 hours a day pissing around in the wind and the rain. If that's not mystic, what is?'   "I think it's essential there's someone like me, if only to wind them up. I'm past the stage of trying to theorise about these places. I know what I believe, but I'm more interested in getting other people to see for themselves."   Cope stops for breath and, as if reviewing his role in life, remarks: "In the end, I'm not a very good rock 'n' roller, but I'm a very good Julian Cope."   · As the summer solstice approaches, historian Andy Worthington discusses sacred landscapes, public access and the politics of heritage at SocietyGuardian.co.uk/environment  · More about Julian Cope at www.headheritage.com   (from the guardian)

      Pilgrims' progress   As antiquarian rock star Julian Cope reflects on the significance of ancient megalithic monuments Andy Worthington says attempts to suppress the popularity of the summer solstice at Stonehenge and Avebury are doomed   Wednesday June 16, 2004   As the summer solstice approaches, heritage managers at Britain's most popular ancient monuments, Stonehenge and its near-neighbour Avebury, will be hoping to avoid confrontation with pagans, travellers and hordes of the young and curious.   The sources of potential conflict are issues of access, ownership and preservation that began over a hundred years ago, when Druid revivalists and crowds of the general public first began to gather at Stonehenge. These issues came to a head in 1985, when the Stonehenge Free Festival, an annual event that had grown from a small gathering in 1974 to become a city-sized alternative state in 1984, was brutally suppressed at the Battle of the Beanfield.   In the wake of the festival's suppression, a four-mile exclusion zone was set up around Stonehenge every summer solstice. Although the authorities achieved a short-term aim, crippling the traveller scene that was at the heart of the festival, first with violence and then with waves of draconian legislation, the frustrated impulses of the festival community mutated into a new raft of interest groups, all staking their own claims on the monument.   A particularly successful example was the road protest movement, famous for campaigns at Twyford Down, Solsbury Hill and Newbury, which was suffused with the general growth of paganism during these years, with its emphasis on nature and ecology, gender equality, libertarianism and the revived, or invented, festivals of an ancient ritual year.   As the violence of the 1980s gave way to a more conciliatory approach, large crowds began to appear at Avebury for the major pagan festivals, and Stonehenge was finally reopened to the public on the solstice in 2000, although only after the House of Lords judged that the exclusion zone was illegal.  The new access arrangements have been phenomenally successful, with over 30,000 people attending the solstice in 2003, and a workable compromise has clearly been achieved, balancing the demands of all the different interest groups with the concerns of those charged with the conservation of Britain's ancient heritage. Nevertheless, doubts over the sustainability of these events remain.  Although English Heritage and the police are resolutely upbeat about the success of the new access arrangements at Stonehenge, the National Trust's property manager, Scott Green, has suggested that "the trust is not convinced that the solstice observance as it is currently celebrated is sustainable in the long-term".   At Avebury, the fault lines are even more evident. At the solstice in 2003, the local council enraged everyone from pagans to the Campaign to Protect Rural England by painting double yellow lines on all the roadside verges in and around the village, and on the night itself there were widespread complaints about the police's heavy-handed approach to removing illegally parked vehicles.  Whilst I understand the concerns of those outlined above, I suspect that all attempts to suppress the popularity of the summer solstice are doomed to failure. For better or worse, the solstice has established itself as an alternative national holiday, a potent mixture of spirituality, politics and celebration that is unlikely to diminish in popularity in the near future.  · Andy Worthington is the author of Stonehenge: Celebration and Subversion, published on June 21 by Alternative Albion  (from the guardian)

      	  GURKHAS WIN WELSH HEARTS    A group of hardened Gurkhas have swapped the Himalayas for a life on the buses in the Welsh hills.    About 20 soldiers have become bus drivers in Llanelli, south Wales, after years serving in trouble spots around the world.    They were appointed after the company 2Travel could not find enough British drivers for its fleet of 108 vehicles.    Bev Fowles, managing director of the company, said: "Local people have really taken to them.    "They are highly respected because of their Army service. They are hard-working, loyal and have excellent driving skills."    The first Gurkha to sign up was Bhim Rai who was coming to the end of his 20 years service.    He had won UN medals for his service in Cyprus and Kosovo, a Gulf war medal and a long service good conduct medal.    The 39-year-old recruited about 20 of his fellow soldiers and intends returning to Nepal to encourage more to sign up.    "I'm really happy in Wales," he told The Daily Telegraph. "It's not really that different to Nepal.    "They (Gurkha drivers) have settled in well and some of them can even speak a bit of Welsh."    The company is helping integrate its drivers by taking them to rugby matches at Llanelli's Stradey Park.

      Tommy Cooper could make people laugh just by standing silent~quote  (i agree, i've said that myself. oh and i laughed at him too. and the repeats they don't show often enough)  But mathematicians will have noticed a rather large flaw in the formula, namely that any joke that does not contain a single pun will have a humour rating of infinity.   That’s why Tommy Cooper could make people laugh just by standing silent or keeling over dead. And that’s presumably why Frank Skinner and David Baddiel are still in paid employment...   excerpts from anorak.co.uk and they got them from the sun they say.

      The formula, outlined by Helen Pilcher and Timandra Harkness, suggests that the funniness of a particular joke is dependent on the length of the build-up and the absence of puns.   It states that X (the humour rating) = (fl+n to the power of o)/p, where f = funniness of punchline, l = length of build-up, n = slapstick factor, o = ouch factor and p = number of puns.    Thus, if we feed our rooster joke into the system, we learn that its humour rating is (8 x 5 + (9 to the power of 2))/1. In other words, 121 out of a possible 200.   test:  It goes as follows: A woman slips on a cow-pat. She gets up only to see a man slip on the same cow-pat. “I did that,” she says. “Well, next time clear it up,” he replies.

      Wierd!!!! :O It's been niggling at me for a couple of weeks now. Maybe longer. People ask how many concerts I've been to, and I don't know, because it's too many to count. I lost count years ago. I don't even go anymore.  Haven't for several years. But I've been to plenty. I saw Adam Ant with my friend Lys in NYC, I'll recall which venue it was sometiime...but by then I stopped collecting all the rock concert ticket stubs and pinning them on my wall... I suddenly remembered The Romantics had opened for Adam Ant, and I'd forgotten they existed even.  I sort of chuckled when I thought how popular they had been then, and that for years I'd forgotten about them. Well, Creem is back. So it says on their website. Odd too, I was trying to remember that "other rock magazine" in the US that was pretty funny, unlike "Rolling Stone." Not very funny.  Creem is back, and what did they have a link for? The Romantics!!!! See? Wierd isn't it?  I never used to get that Boy Howdy thing. O.o I think I do now though.  Back to the SEx PiSToLs. Sid is reading MAD magazine in one of the photos, that was a good one too. Got it each issue. Now I look at it, and think what the? I was allowed to read that when I was 10!!? :O Things were more easy going back then, see, they really were. People in the States now would never allow a 10 year old to read that. They might even consider taking your kid away for it!  "They"..who are they? hmmm....

      still on bob gruen's site. it's making me remember  when i was living in New Jersey, and was a teen in the good ole US of A. I lived in New York City for a while. The first time my Dad visited there, to find us a place, he went out to a pub, an Irish one, the only "pubs" in NYC are Irish. Not that they're real public houses like the British Isles, but when you're an ex-pat they're the closest you'll get. So he went to this pub with workmates, and when he came out, he saw a gunfight in the street. Pretty scary.  Bob Gruen's got a picture of John Lennon wearing a white sleeveless t-shirt with New York City boldy written across the front. I remember the day he was shot in that city. I found out  on the way to high school on one of those big yellow school buses. Some kid came on, towards the end of the ride, I was on that bus almost 2 hours every morning, and he said.."John Lennon's been shot." We were all quiet, just total silence. It seemed impossible. An older girl at the back of the bus sobbed. Guns and the good ole USA. :not impressed:

      linked to this from bob gruen's site. i knew i recognised those pics, at least some of them. i was thinking rolling stone, but then..no it wasn't that mag, it was another one i used to buy when i was 13  and had just moved to the USA. i remember getting my first copy,  because it had the sex pistols in it,  on tour around the USA. wierd stuff. most people there didn't have a clue who they were. if i recall correctly ThE PiSToLs were given a really hard time down south. in Texas maybe? well, in some cowboy bar. :wondering if the blues brothers were inspired by that event:

      ~"CG: There are few British bands that have broken through in America as easily as you have. Why do you think you have had such quick success? Justin: Our Les Pauls! And because I got a really good deal on the seashell guitar…. Dan: There really isn't a better example of a band using the Les Pauls like we do. Everything on the album has Les Pauls in it. We were having a conversation about Strats earlier today. You can only really use them for a bit, but then you have to, you know, return to real life. It's like leaving the tour bus for the minivan. You know? Justin: Well, we're a fun band and live music should be fun. Music is entertainment, and I think people have really overlooked that for a while. Dan: It's a sweeping generalization, in the industry, how everyone gets caught up in "we've got to meet the right people, and sell all the records, and find the right songs……..(smiling) and get the Les Pauls."~  excerpt from gibson guitars site.   (man those guitars must be like magical or something. if i get one, well if anyone gets one, you'll be like famous, you know!  sure sure. )

      epiphone featuring nick valensi on the front page  Epiphone's Don Mitchell recently had the chance to talk with Strokes guitarist, Nick Valensi.   EPI: Hey Nick! How's it going?   NICK: Great, just wrapping up a pretty hectic tour.   EPI: At what age did you first pick-up guitar?   NICK: My parents bought me my first acoustic guitar when I was five years old. They were very encouraging, I guess. By the time I was eight I had convinced them to get me an electric.   EPI: Who were you listening to at the time?   NICK: When I was a kid I was really into Guns N Roses. That was sort of the thing that made me want to be able to really play. Then when I was 12 or 13 Nirvana came out and I started listening to stuff like that...and also started seeking out older music which I hadn't yet gotten a chance to be exposed to. My parents always played the same three tapes: Whitney Houston's first album, some Gypsy Kings tape and Bob Marley, Legend. So I think those things must have somehow made an impression on me.   EPI: Who was the biggest musical influence on your style of guitar playing?   NICK: It's a mix of a bunch of different things. That's the textbook answer, I know, but it's true. I mentioned I was into GNR, so I obviously admire Slash's guitar playing, not to mention Brian May, who Slash ripped off a lot. I also love all the guitar work by the Velvet Underground, whom I got into as a teenager. The Beatles -- and George Harrison specifically -- were an influence. The Cars had good guitar sounds, and awesome solos. It's hard to say who the biggest influence would be because I listen to a lot of shit.   EPI: A lot of magazines have made a big deal about you guys being from Prep School....So how did a group of Prep School students become one of the hottest groups in rock&roll?   NICK: I was actually in public schools all my life, until I went to a private school for a year when I was in high-school. I don't think it was a "Prep School", though. And I don't know how we became "one of the hottest groups in rock n roll". That kind of stuff happens when you're not paying attention, I guess.   EPI: How much effect did the New York club scene have on you?   NICK: We took advantage of the fact that there was a club scene in New York by promoting ourselves shamelessly through it. We'd show up to all the shows, the bars, and the parties to hand out fliers for our next show. I think that had a lot to do with how fast we gained a local following. I mean, we were everywhere. You couldn't pee in a bar without having to stare at a Strokes sticker above the urinal. And then, all of a sudden, everyone in New York knew who we were.   EPI: Your first major success was in the U.K. What was it like being a band from New York and having to trek overseas to support a project that had yet to catch on in your own country? What was the reception there?   NICK: It was great. Our first tour of the U.K. was sold out before we even booked our plane tickets. We didn't mind going overseas, we were just happy that people wanted to see us play. We would've gone to the fucking North Pole if that's where our fans were.   EPI: Tell us about touring with the Rolling Stones. How was the crowd reaction to your music? Did you get to jam with Keith? :-)   NICK: Well, as you can imagine, it was a very cool experience. That being said, their fans were completely indifferent towards us. Lesson learned -- when people pay $150 to see their favorite band, don't waste their time. I didn't get to jam with Keith, no, but I did watch him play a game of snooker against Ron Wood. I don't remember who won. I don't even remember if I spoke. You have to understand, I was pretty nervous.   EPI: In 2002 you were named Band Of The Year by SPIN Magazine and many other publications have been quoted as saying how hugely influential you have been. What is your take on this?   NICK: My take? Uh, well, yes. I agree.   EPI: How did you hook up with Epi?   NICK: I've played Epiphone guitars since I was 13. Back then, I bought one because I wanted an archtop but I didn't have the money for a Gibson or a Gretsch. And now, I just like my Riviera better. It feels nicer than a 335 to me.   EPI: What is it that you like about the Riviera or in other words, what is it that gives you your sound?   NICK: I wasn't happy with the humbuckers in my Riviera so I fitted it with P-94's, and that's been my main guitar ever since. A friend of mine dubbed it "the greatest guitar Gibson NEVER made," because, for some reason, no company ever made a semi-hollow archtop with P-90's in it. I am currently talking with Epiphone about releasing a signature model Riviera, which is cool because I've been wanting to see this kind of guitar made widely available for a long time.   EPI: Tell me everything in your touring arsenal. Guitars? Amps/ Effects?   NICK: I've got a few Epiphone Riviera's fitted with P-94's, and I play through a 2x12 Fender Hot Rod Deville amp. I use a Jekkyl & Hyde pedal (made by Visual Sound) for light distortion when I'm playing rythym, and when I do solos, I use a MXR Micro-Amp pedal. I also have a Boss Tuner pedal. That's it. It's a pretty simple setup.   EPI: What would be your advice for aspiring rock & roll guitarists?   NICK: Practice. And think about practicing when you're not. When you've spent eight hours in some bar, think about how much you could've improved in that time if you would have been practicing. Drink at home, and practice more.    from epiphone.com

      I've added a few more photos on my buzznet http://ylais.buzznet.com/user/ They are of the stadium at RHCP in Cardiff. All I had was a tiny cheap still cam. No flash.  Unusually, they didn't check for cameras, and I was kicking myself, because I didn't bring my better camera. Though I've tried taking pics before, at shows, and generally just get blackness. You really need a professional camera. I mean I was way close to the stage and I still would get blackness. The flash doesn't reach. Ditto with regular video cameras. Quite a lot of people had the mobile phones with cameras in, and they were getting tiny and I mean tiny images. But they were getting something. Must be a digicam out there, that would take good pics now. I'm still on 35mm cameras! :)

      If i heard correctly on bbc radio one, Anthony said he was writing an autobiography, or did he mean a biography of the band.  I guess, it would have to be more about him anywaty since he's the author. Wish they hadn't kept cutting to songs then back to the interview, I couldnt quite get all that was said, or who was saying it exactly. Other than the announcer, interviewer who was the loudest of all, naturally. Nice enough dude, but I'm listening to hear the band, not the interviewer.  It's so typical. Back to the annoyance of Jo Whiley and Glastonbury, and it mostly being her on tv.

      now that does it. my browser just quit, and i've been sitting here with headphones on waiting for that streaming radio one to get to teh red hots show. but it my browser had to go quit on me, after i sat so patiently. no way, am i sitting there like that again.  will be forever wondering if the hyde park show was really on it. :shrugs:  smiling to myself because, i can still picture and hear their concert at cardiff  in my mind...:)   wondering why that guy put English people bugging them at the show. what were they doing? odd. or does he just not like English people? I'm guessing there were loads of English people there. I saw a St. Andrew's flag. Welsh flags. but I don't recall seeing any St. George's flags. or Union Jacks. or Jolly Rogers for that matter.  mind you he was from Swansea. what does that mean? i dunno. i don't care for all that stupid stuff between the nations. or anyone.  but hey i had a couple of idiots behind me. smoking weed. which didn't please me too much.  other people!!! jeeez! lmao!!

       Review: Red Hot Chili Peppers  Jun 24 2004  Claire Hill, The Western Mail    THE Red Hot Chili Peppers last night rocked Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in the capital's biggest gig of the year. Frontman Anthony Kiedis and band members Flea, Chad and John are known for the flamboyant stage performances and the ability to give the audiences a great night. They did not disappoint.  Proof of their pulling power are the support acts that have included N.E.R.D. and for the Cardiff leg of tours across Europe and the UK, the Godfather of Soul, James Brown.  Three-and-a-half hours after the stadium opened last night the fans finally got what they wanted. A semi-clad bassist Flea and fellow members Chad and John entered the stage to give a rousing instrumental before frontman Kiedis ran on stage sporting long hair, a fringe and suit with cut-off trousers.  The crowd may have enjoyed the support act but it was the Chili Peppers they were desperate for. The legendary foursome blasted their way through the likes of Scar Tissue, By the Way, Zephyr Song and Californication. Bassist Flea was on form as was guitarist John, who gave an amazing rendition of Donna Summer's I Feel Love.  Rock, funk and some slow tempo songs filled the damp Cardiff air and hung in the atmosphere of the closed Millennium Stadium. Jumping around on stage, Kiedis, at 41, had energy of someone half his age. And the crowd were overawed by the band.  The hits were coming out and the band were there to please but we must also discuss the Godfather that is James Brown. Like a blast from the old days of funk, the James Brown experience arrived. With Cuban heels, tonged hair and tassels himself he should now be the geriatric machine but the sex machine still belted and danced his way through the songs.  There was a heavy emphasis on the music throughout the set but he got better and Living In America, Man's World and Sex Machine really showed what he can do, yeah.  But it was the Chili Peppers, enigmatic, energetic and pretty damn amazing, who showed they were well worth the money, not putting a foot wrong.  An encore wouldn't be an encore without the audience singing back Under the Bridge and an explosive version of Give It Away which ended with the drum kit being thrown into the pit and a topless Kiedis crouching on the remains.    Red Hot Chili Peppers, Millennium Stadium, Cardiff Review and rate this peformance  3 user reviews. Average rating:  5 stars   Anthony from Bargoed	05:08:40 PM 24 June 2004 This was the best gig I've ever been to. The crowd was amazing, the songs- awesome and that was just james brown and the chilis were even better. Chicks on speed were ok but weren't great ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Olga from Cardiff	04:49:54 PM 24 June 2004 The Chilis' performance was the most amazing experince any fan could have. Actually, to say "amazing" would be too much of an understatement. The setlist was perfect and the crowds loved the show. This was definitely the greatest experience I've ever had, and I'm sure anyone else who was there would say the same thing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Craig from Swansea	03:47:41 PM 24 June 2004 What a preformance, the chilli's were aboslutly AWESOME. Scar Tissue, And Throw away you Television, were my highlights, but the whole night was brilliant, apart from some English people annoying the rest of US!. Did James Brown sing a full song or was he just there for the chorus's???

      Anthony sounds so unpretentious in these interviews, which is what I like about him and the RHCP anyway, it just really comes across these days. or people are actually listening to them, and putting them on the radio here, and letting us hear now how unpretentous they are. Years ago, he seemed like a big dude on the tv, that's when i was back in the states watching them. Pam and I adored Anthony. We got all giggly when he came on tv.  He's not big though. He's just got a lot of energy on stage. And those old videos and tv appearances..well tv does make a difference. He looks cute. Not physically big. nope. just in good shape.  Flea says his daughter thinks he's a dork and he is a dork.

       Madonna will tour holy sites in Israel after her Re-Invention tour, according to Israeli newspaper Maariv. The superstar will be one of 100 Kabbalah students who will visit areas of religious significance in Autumn to coincide with the Jewish New Year on September 15. Earlier Madonna adopted the ancient name of Esther as part of her Kabbalah studies.  mtv news round up    she's in the sun or the mirror or both today. they're the same paper to me. i mean i put them in the same spot in my mind. so one of these has her bending over showing her tartan undies with a big white, and i mean BIG white E embroidered or sticky tape, or duct taped, well generally speaking she has a stupid big pair of red tartan knickers on with a stupid big E on her arse. and she keeps showing it off. desperate or what? desperate but not serious...adam ant sang...but she's seriously annoying, and seriously desperate for attention. and why am i even featuring her in my blog. because this isn't just about things I like. I never claimed it was. It's some scrapbook I'm keeping, that's all, and sometimes, okay quite frequently, I come across things that are so stupid and boring like this. She's so boring. If I rant anymore I may get in trouble, I mean seem slike she has eyes everywhere. O.o I was living in Wiltshire near Stonehenge for a while, and it got so tiresome reading or hearing about her and her Wiltshire estate.

       "Mummy's Boy  The Daily Star carries an interview with Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins today in which he reveals that his mum used to hang out with infamous rock wild man Brian Jones, the Rolling Stones' original drummer. It seems her acquaintance with Jonesy helped her inspire Justin's love of catsuits.  He tells the tab: "She used to hang out with Brian Jones and tell me this story about him turning up in a disco in a pink catsuit and unzipped it dangerously low as he danced with the girls. I've always thought that was how rock stars should look."  Not only did Justin's mum know Brian Jones, she once shared a bottle of scotch with none other than Jimi Hendrix. Perhaps this explains Justin's love of guitar solos: "I always valued virtuoso guitar and singers in tight trousers screaming. That was my perception of what rock should be.""  from top of the pops bbc site    actually, i've seen this story in a few places. i'm certain it's on the main bbc site as well, either norfolk bbc, or suffolk bbc. they seem to be both laying claim to the darkness these days.  why is this so wierd? well, my father hung out with Brian Jones, that's why. where? not in suffolk or norfolk, though his family is from norfolk, well his mother is. but why tell my whole family's ancestry now? this was in the Reading area. Brian Jones is from Woodley, just outside Reading. My father went to school with Brian Jones girlfriend. met at Mr Jones at a pub. and so on, as these things go.  so where was the Hawkins mum when this was all going on? when? where? etc?

      I'm exhausted. I danced wildly through James Brown. Had a slight break until the RHCP came on stage, but I was so excited with the anticipation, and the atmosphere in the Millenium Stadium. Great crowd of people I had around me, all smiling, excited, and pleased to be there. All having a good time, wonderful to see the huge smiles on people's faces. Only a couple of downers, a group of 4 young teens, I'd guess about 15 years old, booing the opening act, Chicks on Speed. They certainly didn't deserve to be booed. Some people think that's a cool thing to do, and they generally are 15 year old groups of teenage boys. Too cool right? Boo the girls on stage that don't have guitars. Myself, I found them really entertaining, an enticing, cheeky and fun stage show. Silly, in a cheeky way, bit punky, feminist, clashing. A couple of good songs, which are still stuck in my mind! "we don't play guitars" and "99 cents" It's nice to see something fresh like that. It was cheeky since the Chilis are a guitar band. The woman in their show coming on and playing air guitar during "we don't play guitars" was hilarious. So I told the lads behind me to shut up. Some good dance club song moments in there too. Sometimes they grooved,  and at others were a bit more pop. The main problem was the sound system, it tended to fade in and out. Would have been better in a smaller venue, but then anyone would. That stadium is huge. (wondering when they'll be an American Football tour there?!!!) I much prefer small venues for seeing anyone live. I was glad I had a seat for a change, and not down on the floor in the sea of bodies. Still think it's outrageous what they charge for a stadium show. The price of the other stuff there is worse~like snacks, but man the cost of t-shirts and hats and posters, etc...totally beyond belief and I still got myself stuff! oh yeah and parking, petrol...forgetting that cash stuff though for now.  If I were going to see one show this year, or any year, it had to be the RHCP. I would have gone even if James Brown weren't a special guest, and I bought the tickets months ago, so I didn't have a clue who would be opening, I didn't care. But James Brown! What a great surprise, and what an honour. His band were excellent musicians, all of them. The singers were brillaint. He still has enormous stage presence, and gives everyone on stage their own moment to shine! I wasn't too fond of the two dancers in skimpy shorts and halter tops. I would have been, had the camera men not become so fixated on them. Most of the time, what we were seein gon the big scrrens were the dancers' backsides, not the musicians, or the singers, or "the hardest working man in show business." i danced through the whole set. I was grooving! :) Couldn't help it with that music! It was more of a musician big band show, than singin enitre songs, like his hits the whole way through. (no say it loud, i'm black and i'm proud) Somewhere in there, I got a bit lost in the dancing...I was moved! Break time. Waiting for the Red Hots. The usual big stadium stuff. People going to the loo in droves, gettgin beer, and more beer in huge plastic cups, getting lost, and not being able to find their seats, massive lines, though still a friendly lot generally, and amazingly not much pushing and shoving that I've seen elsewhere. And I've been to loads, which is why I suppose I was a bit fed up with the stadium scene and its rituals. Been going since I was 14 in the states. The big stadium shows never quite do it for me. In the UK, I'd only been to one huge show at  Wembley and it was horrendous, possibly the worst show I have ever been too. That's another story to tell, so on to the Chilis. Dum de dum..waiting for the stadium rituals to be over with, the roadies, sorry engineers, stage managers, setting up the Chilis stage. All set up nice and clean and tidy, nothing extra. A ramp at the back. Drums smack in the middle. Very minimal. Suddenly the entire arena floor was covered with people packed tightly in, so many more than had been there earlier, lights out, and the RHCP red and white logo on all the screens. Such a build up. I was feeling like I was in a scene from Beatlemania... Lights up on stage, three Red Hots, ..me screaming, "We've got John" Yes, i was yelling out, ..John Frusciante had come on, and he was on my side of the stage..okay I was up in the stands, but I love him, he's become my favourite over the last few years..I did quite a bit of yelling and screaming, jumping around, groovy dancing...let that music take you away stuff... My fave Chili Pepper, and my fave lead guitarist, well my fave guitarist, musican, all around. So I was beside myself, and amazed that I was so bloody excited over something like that at my age, at the same time! We were treated to a preview from those guys before Anthony  Kiedis came on stage,..Flea and John played so well the whole night, and did a lot of playing standing together, and playing off each other, it was the best I've seen, as far as musicians really playing together, spurring each other on..I danced all over the place grinning through the whole concert. a few times, I was moved to tears, that guitar gets to me...they are so bloody full of energy on stage, all of them. Great part was when Anthony, Flea, and John jumped up and down in time with each other, John and Flea still playing their guitars.  Anthony was full of energy! Is he always like that?! Nothing but them , and their music really this time. No light bulbs on their heads. Some good images on the screens for each song. Live, the music comes across way more, and Anthony's voice became more a part of the music. On recordings his voice tends to stand out a ot more. They gave us a lot of treats too, that you don't get on their LPs like solos from Flea..how often can a bass guitarist carry that off? Solos from John. The lads standing back and looking like what the feck is he doing at John, as John played "I feel love', then started singing it, in a stirringly high and beautiful voice. Now that I loved, and the crowd did too...but he didn't do the whole song!!! Just got us all going, and wanting more. They went from popular ballads, to punk, funk, rock....Flea came on with his trumpet and made some wierd and wonderful sounds with it, with the aid of John who was down on the floor at the front fiddling with sound effects. The pair of them together, whether on their guitars, or doing something more experimental, were amazing. I had expected Anthony to be the main attraction, in the sense that he always is so animated and puts his all into it, but he seemed to like handing it over to Flea and John,  He was really digging them too. Now, I've left out their marvelous drummer! Those poor drummers, they work so hard, and they get stuck at the back all the time. Then they leave the stage and the other guys tear their drum kit apart and sling the drums off the front of the stage. Well, that does stop them coming back on for any more encores!  More about the show sometime...John mad even more now. :)   Man the beer companies do sure put a lot these days into selling their beer! festivals, stadium shows, not one or two acts, no three plus...

      "the traditional seasonal festivals in Wales were Calan Gaeaf (Hallowe'en), Calan Mai, and Midsummer. Additionally, each parish celebrated a Gwyl Mabsant in commemoration of its native saint." wikipedia   "The patronal festival (Gwyl Mabsant) was the day in times gone by when Welsh people celebrated their local saint. On that day they celebrated by going to church and then enjoyed themselves playing games, dancing and singing and drinking. The day was a chance to remember and enjoy themselves, their religion was full of joy.  But then, as the Welsh turned to nonconformity, things like games, singing and dancing became taboo. Over time, many of the old customs were lost as the religion of the Welsh became more serious and sober.  Today, everybody remembers and celebrates March the first as St David's day - Wales' patron saint. But how many remember those other early saints whose names are recorded in the names of churches and places throughout the country?  Look at a map of Wales. How many place-names being in "Llan" - a piece of land with a wall around it where the earliest churches were built. Many have the names of a Celtic saint such as Dewi (David), Teilo or Padarn - saints of the fifth and sixth centuries usually. Others have the names of Mair (The Virgin Mary), Mihangel (St Michael) and Pedr (St Peter) - churches which belong to the 12th century onwards."  acen.co.uk

      since it's the festival season now. most festivals being well huge rock concerts these days, i found this article fascinating. what were festivals like?  "Gwˆylmabsantau By Emma Lile, National Museums & Galleries of Wales Published: 15 June 2004  The gwˆyl mabsant was one of the most popular festivals in the Welsh rural calendar. Commemorating the local parish saint, this annual celebration developed from a dedication through prayer to a programme of recreational pastimes, enjoyed by all. First mentioned in writing around 1470, gwˆylmabsantau were common throughout Wales until the mid- to late 19th-century. According to author Benjamin Malkin writing in 1803, the Radnorshire parish revels ‘rendered a kind of circus for every sport and exercise’ while a Vale of Clwyd parson, quoted by Elias Owen in 1886, claimed that wakes ‘gave an individuality to parochial life and fostered parish patriotism’.  Among the games regularly contested were a selection of athletic sports, ranging from running races to old women’s grinning matches and blindfolded wheelbarrow-driving. At the three day sports event held in Llangyfelach near Swansea in 1780, competitions and prizes included a women’s race for a smock and petticoat, eating a hot pudding for a silver table spoon, and a bull bait, in which the owner of the best dog received a bull calf. Animal sports were a familiar scene, particularly cockfights, on which large amounts of money were wagered. Birds were specially trained for the contest, and the owner of a victorious cockerel was held in high esteem.  Early versions of Association Football were often played over Christmas, New Year and at Shrovetide. Large crowds of spectators gathered to witness the matches, which, owing to a lack of pre-determined rules, tended to degenerate into chaos, with injuries being commonplace.  Bando was another favoured team sport and continued in some areas until the late 19th-century. Particularly popular in Glamorgan, bando was similar to the modern game of hockey and teams used clubs to strike the ball towards a goal. Bando contained elements which were constant lubricants of sport across the centuries and which foresaw the coming of organised games. These included an agreed number of players, a fixed area of play, teams differentiated by colours (such as the red and white favoured by the Margam side, west Glamorgan), gambling on the result and matches well-patronised by brewers.  Owing to the combination of betting, feasting and alcohol consumption, it was not surprising that parish festivals built-up a reputation for their rowdiness. Publicans often played a significant role in organising and promoting sports events, and many cockfights, running races, and the like, were arranged over the bar. The games contested were invariably rather high-spirited affairs and unwritten rules were often decided informally before the start of a match. As many sports were localised activities, rules usually differed from place to place, leading to disagreements between parishes.  Concern regarding the unlicensed revelry and alcoholic over-indulgence commonly occurring at the festivals, as well as the doubtful benefits of the games themselves, was increasingly voiced from several quarters from the 18th-century onwards, most noticeably by religious leaders.  The Methodist and other religious revivals which swept across Wales from the mid 18th-century until the turn of the 20th-century, attacked sporting activities indiscriminately as worthless and sinful. Physical recreation was viewed by some as a great threat to the morals of the population, with eminent religious figures such as Thomas Charles and Griffith Jones seeking to suppress impious fairs and festivals, the former depicting Wales in 1799 as ‘sunk in superstition and vice’. Consequently, parishioners turned increasingly to churches and chapels for release and salvation, and as prayer meetings were sometimes purposely arranged to clash with sports days, religion became a potent force in the latter’s eventual decline."  from wales past

      this www.walespast.com is a treasure trove!   "Finding ancient druids By Adam Gwilt, National Museums & Galleries of Wales Published: 18 February 2004  Using ancient sources and archaeological evidence, the origins and development of the druids is explored. Druids, the ancient priests of Britain and Ireland, have long intrigued and kindled the imagination of large popular audiences. The stereotypical image of the white robed wise man, carrying perhaps a golden sickle and mistletoe, or clasping a white staff, remains strong with us today, the outcome of many centuries of thinking and invention. Yet what evidence do we have for these powerful but elusive figures?  Earliest mention of Druids comes from the Classical authors, notably Posidonius, Strabo and Julius Caesar, writing during the 1st-century BC. These inform us of druidae in Gaul (France) and Britain, who were wise men, observers of natural phenomena and moral philosophers. They performed powerful roles in these Celtic societies, sanctioning war, acting as keepers of knowledge, administrators of justice and supervisors of sacrifices and religious ceremonies.  Closely allied were bards (bardoi), the singers and poets, and diviners (vates), who interpreted sacrifices in order to foretell the future. Caesar suggests that Druidism originated in Britain, whilst Timaeus, a Greek historian, is thought to have first mentioned them as early as the later 4th-century BC.  Druids and bards were also prominent in medieval Welsh and Irish texts, probably giving account of much earlier oral tradition, passed on by word of mouth. The Irish texts include the Ulster Cycle, the Book of the Dun Cow and the Fenian Cycle.  In Wales, the roles and privileges of bards were laid out in documents relating to laws set down by Hywel Dda in the 10th-century AD. During the 18th-century, druids came to be seen as the ancestors of the bards, the praise poets, musicians and genealogists, who flourished in Welsh medieval society.  The visual appearance of druids - what they wore and what possessions they owned - is difficult to clarify. There are few illustrations or inscriptions of the time, whilst the evidence provided by archaeology rarely provides certain answers. A druidic ceremony recounted by the author Pliny, in his Natural History, has been drawn upon by many. In this account, a white robed druid climbs an oak tree to cut down mistletoe with a golden sickle.  A revival of interest in druids began during the Renaissance (14th to 16th-centuries), when translations of the Classical Greek and Roman texts became widely available. A number of sources describe the druids as performing human sacrifice, their places of worship being in isolated wooded groves and near sacred pools and lakes. For example, the historian Tacitus writing during the 1st-century AD tells us of the druidic groves on Mona (Anglesey), mentioning also that the blood of prisoners was drenched upon their altars.  Such accounts led John Aubrey, leading antiquary of his time, to suggest in 1659 that the stone circles at Avebury and Stonehenge had been druidic temples. Similarly, in 1723, the Reverend Henry Rowlands identified a number of megalithic monuments on Anglesey as the temples and sacrificial altars of druids. By the late 18th-century, 'neo-druidism', led by the likes of the Reverend William Stukely, had become a potent cultural movement in Britain. However, with advances in archaeological understanding during the 19th-century, it became clear that these monuments were built over 4,000 years ago, long before the appearance of druids. Nevertheless, modern druids and bards continue to meet within stone circles today.  If archaeology struggles to identify druids, it does nevertheless provide convincing evidence for the religious expression of Celtic Iron Age people. In Wales, a tradition of offering prestige metalwork to the gods is well illustrated at the site of Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey. Here, between 300BC and AD100, chariots, weapons, tools and decorated metalwork items were cast from a causeway or island into a small lake. Coincidentally, an account by the Roman author Tacitus vividly recounts the crushing of a druidic stronghold on Anglesey by the Roman army, leading some to infer that Llyn Cerrig Bach was a druidic site.  Other instances of Celtic Iron Age ritual have also been identified. For example, a probable sacrificial victim preserved in peat has been found at Lindow Moss in Cheshire (England). In southern and eastern England, Iron Age temples containing offerings of coins, brooches, food and weapons have been excavated. Recently, the famous Cerrig-y-Drudion bowl, elaborately decorated in the Celtic or La Tène art style, has also been convincingly interpreted as a ceremonial crown. This and a number of other crowns and regalia, found with burials or in temples in Britain, may have denoted priestly office.  In this prehistoric world, the power of the pagan Celtic gods was keenly felt, ever present and intermingled within everyday life."  funny, because it has pictures of Llyn Cerrig Bach at the bottom of this page, and I used those pictures in my presentation, at Trinity College Carmarthen.  i'm stillnot convinced about the slave chains. but that's in my presentation, and it'll take me a while to sort it out and type it online. i just moved, and all my papers are still stored away.

      i have this book. i got it when it was released, and really enjoyed it.  Vikings in Wales: an archaeological quest by Mark Redknap. Published by the National Museums & Galleries of Wales (2000).  so was thrilled to see an article by Mark Redknap about ancestral faces from viking age anglesey. (i shall have to put my Llyn Carreg Bach paper and presentation on here soon, or on my website)  here's the text on Viking Faces: the link has interesting photos of the dig, and recreation of face.  "Ancestral faces from Viking-age Anglesey By Dr Mark Redknap, National Museums & Galleries of Wales Published: 05 April 2004  Science brings to life the victims of a thousand year old murder-mystery. Excavations conducted by the National Museums & Galleries of Wales of the early medieval settlement at Llanbedrgoch (Anglesey) have started to unlock details of life in 9th and 10th-century Wales, and the development of a Viking-age centre with trading links across the Irish Sea.  In 1998-99, an unexpected and puzzling discovery was made on the west side of the settlement. Five human skeletons were found in the upper level of a filled-in ditch immediately outside a defensive wall that surrounded the settlement. Contrary to usual Christian practice, all skeletons were aligned with their heads either to the north or south rather than to the east.  They appear to have been casually buried in shallow graves. Three of the bodies had been buried individually, but there was one double burial in which an adult male (approximately 23-35 years old) had been thrown directly on top of a child (approximate age 10-15 years old). The adult male's arms may have been tied behind his back and he may have suffered a blow to the left eye with a sharp object. Another older adult male (35-45 years old) appears to have been placed face down, turned to left, body slightly twisted, and he may have had his wrists fastened in front of his body.  In the case of three of the burials the bodies were overlain by limestone blocks and smaller rubble, probably derived from the collapse of the enclosure wall. This suggests they were buried shortly before the abandonment of the site.  The dating of the Llanbedrgoch skeletons points to the second half of the 10th-century, a period when Vikings on the Isle of Man effectively controlled Gwynedd, and may have had bases on Anglesey. The circumstances of burial and lack of Christian orientation have led to speculation that these individuals were victims of raiding. The precise circumstances of their deaths may never be known, but they may have been the victims of military activity by Vikings in their search for wealth, perhaps in the form of hostages or slaves.  Study continues on the data collected during the excavations, as we attempt to reconstruct the settlement which our four Viking-age faces would have recognised. Not only has the site produced a wealth of evidence for settlement layout, buildings, artefacts and standards of living on a high status site - it has also provided the remains of people who once breathed and walked there."

      "The Amesbury Archer  The grave of a man dating to around 2,300BC was discovered three miles from Stonehenge by Wessex Archaeology staff in May 2002. His grave was the richest from this period (the early Bronze Age) ever found in Britain and contained the country’s first gold objects.  He was found during excavation in advance of a housing development at Amesbury in Wiltshire, and the man was dubbed the “Amesbury Archer” or the “King of Stonehenge” by the media. He has featured on several radio and TV programmes, including the BBC2 Ancestors series.  This section gives full details, including the results of tests carried out in late 2002 to find out as much information about the Archer, and a second skeleton found nearby.  Exhibition News   The Archer will be on display in the Buried Treasure exhibition at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, from 14 May to 24 September 2004. Photographs of the display from the Buried Treasure exhibition at the British Museum can be found here. "  now i've got a very good reason to visit National Museum of Wales, Cardiff.

      Press Release  Builders of Stonehenge found  As the summer solstice dawned over Stonehenge, archaeologists revealed that some of the men who built Stonehenge have been found.  Their grave, which dates to the beginning of the Bronze Age, about 2,300 BC, was found at Boscombe Down near to Stonehenge. Many of the stones at Stonehenge were brought from Wales at about this time and chemical tests on the teeth of the men have shown that they were almost certainly born in Wales.  Archaeologists are calling the men ‘the Boscombe Bowmen’ because of the flint arrowheads in the grave. Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick, of Wessex Archaeology, said: “In medieval times, people believed that the stones could only have been brought to Stonehenge by Merlin the Wizard. For the first time we have found the mortal remains of one of the families who were almost certainly involved in this monumental task.”  The grave is unusual as it contains the remains of not one, but seven people. There were three children, a teenager and three men. The skulls of the men and the teenager are so similar that they must be related.  The Bowmen’s teeth provided the clue to where they came from. As the enamel forms on children’s teeth, it locks in a chemical fingerprint of where they grew up. Tests by scientists of the British Geological Survey on the strontium isotopes in the Bowmen’s teeth show that they grew up in a place where the rocks are very radiogenic. This was either in the Lake District or Wales. The men’s teeth also all have the same pattern, showing that they migrated between the ages of 3 and 13. Dr Jane Evans of the British Geological Survey said: “This provides a remarkable picture of prehistoric migration.”  The grave was found last year during road improvement works being carried out by QinetiQ, the science and technology company that operates the Boscombe Down airfield. Tests on the finds have just been completed by Wessex Archaeology. The QinetiQ employee and archaeologist Colin Kirby, who made the discovery said: “On the second day of the excavations, I noticed human in the side of a water pipe trench. On investigating the spoil from the trench, fragments of beaker pottery and an arrowhead emerged. This was very exciting as it showed that the burial was probably Bronze Age and may be linked to the Amesbury Archer. I immediately informed Wessex Archaeology.”  Seven or eight pots were buried with the dead to hold food and drink for the journey to the next life. The pots are very similar to those found nearby with the Amesbury Archer, a man who was given the richest burial of the age in Europe. He is the earliest metalworker known from Britain, and his grave contained the earliest gold objects in Britain. Tests on his teeth showed that he came from central Europe.  The Archer and the Bowmen lived around the time of major building works at Stonehenge. The stones brought from the Preseli Hills 250 km away in south-west Wales are called the bluestones because of their colour. The huge sarsen stones were brought from the Marlborough Downs 30 km to the north.  Dr Fitzpatrick added: “The Boscombe Bowmen, a band of brothers, must almost certainly be linked with the bringing of the bluestones to Stonehenge. With the discovery that the Amesbury Archer came from central Europe, these finds are casting the first light on an extraordinary picture at the dawn of the metal age.  “Through the mists of time, we can start to see the very people who brought the building blocks of the greatest temple of its age. We can also glimpse the important people who were associated with that temple to the gods of the sun and the moon. It is an epic story.’  The finds will be on display in Salisbury Museum in the exhibition ‘Changing Places’ from Saturday 3rd July.  ENDS

      Welsh brothers helped build Stonehenge  21/6/2004  A Bronze Age grave discovered in Boscombe Down, near Stonehenge, has revealed that some of the builders of the ancient ceremonial site were Welsh.  Archaeologists are calling the men ‘the Boscombe Bowmen’ because of the flint arrowheads in the grave. Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick of Wessex Archaeology said: “The Boscombe Bowmen, a band of brothers, must almost certainly be linked with the bringing of the bluestones to Stonehenge.   With the discovery that the Amesbury Archer came from central Europe, these finds are casting the first light on an extraordinary picture at the dawn of the metal age.  The Bowmen’s teeth provided an essential clue to where they came from. As the enamel forms on children’s teeth, it locks in a chemical fingerprint of where they grew up.Tests by scientists of the British Geological Survey on the strontium isotopes in the Bowmen’s teeth show that they grew up in a place where the rocks are very radioactive.   This was either in the Lake District or Wales. The men’s teeth also all have the same pattern, showing that they migrated between the ages of 3 and 13.  Adam Gwilt, curator at the National Museum in Wales, said: “Using this new technique we are beginning to see the long distances over which people travelled during the Bronze Age. Transporting the Preseli bluestones to this sacred place was a monumental achievement.”  The stones brought from the Preseli Hills 250 km away in south west Wales are called the bluestones because of their colour. It still remains a mystery as to how the huge blue stones from the Welsh mountains were dragged 200 miles to the ancient ceremonial site.  The Amesbury Archer is featured in the Buried Treasure exhibition currently on show at the museum.

      "The Cure star Robert Smith has blasted The Darkness because they remind him of how much he hated Queen.  The goth superstar admits he thinks the "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" hit makers are "a comedy band."  Smith says, "I can honestly say I hated Queen and everything that they did. To have that rehashed and reheated for a second time around is pretty weird ... I don't like The Darkness at all." "   too funny. the Cure did some funny thing themselves, and that's when i liked them best. "Let's go to bed" and "Love Cats". the videos to both of those. "The Walk" one of my all time faves. Well, it's quite bizarre, so is Robert in that video. So this seems odd for him to say. Suddenly he is serious so much. I don't like Queen either,and I had a similar experience as Robert says growing up. Too much Queen on the Tele all the time, and all around me people that liked Queen. I didn't. But I love The Darkness. They aren't Queen at all. Nor are they Def Leppard which loads of people say their like too. I didn't like Def Leppard either. Fussy kid huh? I used to wait for the Cure to come on MTV back then in Def Leppard days! :D

      David took he dog for a walk yesterday and he took the web/still cam as usual. He likes taking photos lately, and then putting some of them on buzznet photologs and moblogs. (still haven't got a clue what a moblog is) he took 4 photos of his shadow and the dog's shadow against a cave wall. it looks like a cave wall anyway. thing is the shadows look solid. the dog's looks huge, more like a horse. they are very spooky. when i saw the first one pop up on the mac desktop when he ran a slideshow of the latest pics, i jumped, whoa that's creepy i said.  black shuck, the dog.  i called it the hounds of hell on the photo blog.  spooky.  but David tends to unawarely know stuff, and that black dog is what? a portend of death?!

      this is from a very good myth and legends site. these black dog stories, make me think of all the black cat tales going around wales. as usual. big black cats. there's an old scottish myth about a big black cat. must find it. same tale goes on and on...   Phantom Black Dogs Stories of phantom black dogs abound in Britain, almost every county has its own variant, from the Black Shuck of East Anglia to the Padfoot and Bogey Beast of Yorkshire. Phantom black dogs have been witnessed too frequently in modern times to parcel the phenomena as pure folklore and legend, but then folklore and legend often has origins in real events. There are various theories to explain the phenomena and they seem to have many common traits from sighting to sighting.  In appearance the phantoms vary from region to region, but it is not uncommon for them to be described as calf sized, with saucer eyes and a shaggy coat. Phantom dogs are not always black however, the one that is supposed to haunt the area around Cawthorpe and Haugham in Lincolnshire, is described as white, but still has saucer eyes and is as big as calf. The Cu Sith, the traditional fairy dog of Scotland is dark green in colour, with a shaggy tail up its back. Black dogs are more often than not associated with a specific location such as an old trackway or lane, this is sometimes reflected in the name of the routeway, although not every 'Black Dog Lane' has a tradition of the haunting.  There have been some attempts at classification; the folklorist Theo Brown divided the black dog phenomena into three separate types A, B and C. (A) Being a shape-shifting demon dog; (B) being a dark black dog calf sized with shaggy fur; and (C) a dog that appears in time with certain ancient festivals in specific areas of the country. Katherine Briggs, the renowned folklorist, splits these further into demon dogs, the ghosts of human beings and the ghosts of dogs in their own right.  In local traditions the black dogs sightings are seen as death portents, especially those seen in ancient churchyards in the form of the Church or Kirk Grim (Kirk being the Scottish word for Church), which is thought to represent a folk memory of a sacrifice. The black dog that used to haunt Peel castle and a nearby graveyard on the Isle of Man, is one such grim, it is said to have scared a sentry to death. Other sightings from the South of England, have been related to coincidental sudden deaths. The next two accounts relate to actual deaths by a black dog over four hundred years ago, although it is likely both events were the result of ball lightning:  A weather vane in Bungay Market in Suffolk depicts a black dog and a flash of lighting, it commemorates an event on Sunday the 4th of August 1577. Between nine and ten in the morning while the parishioners of Bungay were at church, a fearful and violent storm broke out, which caused the sky to darken and the church to quake. Suddenly, in the midst of the storm, a black dog appeared within church. Lit by flashes of fire, it ran about the body of the church causing great fear and panic. It passed between two people kneeling at prayer, killing them instantly, and caused another man to shrivel up, severely burned, although he is said to have survived.  About seven miles away in Blythburgh, at around the same time, another black dog (or the same phenomena) appeared in the parish church preceded by the same thunderstorm. This black dog struck three people dead and left scorch marks on the North church door, which can still be seen today.  These two examples suggest phenomena related to the weather conditions, perhaps some form of little understood ball lighting, substantiated by the fact that one person was burned, and the scorch marks on the church door. It is difficult to make any snap judgements because of the long span of time involved from the recorded events.  Other phantom dogs are more benevolent and stories exist of people being helped from tight spots. For example Augustus Hare in his book 'In My Solitary Life' recounts a common tale he heard about a man called Johnnie Greenwood, of Swancliffe. Johnnie had to ride through a wood in darkness for a mile to get to where he was going. At the entrance of the wood he was joined by a black dog, it pattered beside him until he emerged from the trees, whereupon it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived.  On his return journey through the wood, the dog joined him again on the dark woodland path, and disappeared mysteriously when he emerged. Apparently, some years later, two prisoners condemned to death confessed that they had decided to rob and murder Johnny that night in the wood, but the presence of the large black dog had stopped them. Black dogs often seem to haunt ancient lanes, trackways, crossroads, old churchyards and prehistoric sites. Many of these places were associated with local superstitions and the uncanny, they are liminal places, where the veil between worlds was thought to be thin. The haunts of the black dogs are also features said to denote ley lines, it has been suggested that they represent some form of energy or natural phenomena moulded by the mind into an archetype of the black dog. A great deal of work has been done by earth mystery researchers to suggest that certain geophysical conditions may affect the human mind. These places were recognised by ancient man, and that is why black dogs (as some form of archetype) appear at places of ancient sanctity. This same theory has been applied to other unexplained phenomena.  Gallows sites (often crossroads) were also common black dog haunts, the black dog was often seen as the spirit of the executed criminal, such as the dog said to haunt a gallows site in Tring, Hertfordshire: An old woman was drowned for witchcraft at Tring in the year 1751. A chimney sweep was held responsible in part for the killing, and was hanged and gibbeted near to the place of the crime. A black dog came to haunt the place where the gibbet stood, and was seen by the village schoolmaster. He described it as being shaggy, as big as a Newfoundland, with long ears and a tail, eyes of flaming fire and long teeth. It is interesting to note that at first the black dog appeared as a standing flame. Flames and scorched earth being another aspect associated with sightings.  Black dogs are also seen as guardians of treasure, especially in Scotland. A black dog was said to guard treasure buried under a standing stone near Murthley in Perthshire, here we have an account of a black dog at an ancient site and as a guardian of treasure.  In summery it seems that the phenomena of phantom dogs is a complex mix of folklore, sightings, and local superstition, which has roots reaching far into the past. There are probably a myriad of different explanations for modern sightings, and a phantom black dog is a powerful archetype, incorporated into modern stories such as the 'Hound of the Baskervilles' by Arthur Conan Doyle. We hope to delve into the mystery further in the future, including some of the many folk tales associated with them.  Some names in different counties:  Bogey Beast, Lancashire  Bargheust, Yorkshire and the North  Black Shuck, East Anglia  Capelthwaite, Westmorland (Cumbria)  Cu Sith, Highlands (Dark Green)  Gallytrot, Suffolk  Guytrash  Gurt Dog, Somerset  Hairy Jack, Lincolnshire  Mauthe Dog, (Mauthe Doog) Scotland  Old Shock or Shuck (Black Shuck), Suffolk  Padfoot, Yorkshire  Pooka, Ireland  Skriker, Lancashire, Yorkshire

      Tales of phantom hounds abound in the folklore of the British Isles. The origins of these supernatural beasts are shrouded in mystery. The common names of these ghostly animals vary according to locality. `Old Shuck`(Norfolk), `Old shock`(Suffolk), `yeth`(Devon) `Pooka` (Ireland), `Barguest`(Yorkshire) to name but a few.  The true origins of the Hell Hounds has since been lost in the mists of time but the stories probably originated from the Viking raiders hound of their god Odin and the Celtic legends of Arawn whose hounds of hell searched for human souls.  There are many tales of a phantom hound in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Known locally as black shuck in Cambridge, its favourite haunts where said to be along the banks of the river Ouse and amongst the flat landscape of the fens. Other local names have been galley trot, old snarleyow, or old scarfe.  There are not many recent reports of sightings of the creature but there is an interesting parallel to the recent big cat sightings. The creatures where said to normally be black, the size of a very large dog or as big as a small calf. They were reported as having large saucer shaped eyes of red or yellow. In some instances they have been reported as being headless or having just one large Cyclops type eye. To see or even hear the phantom hound was a foreboding of misfortune, madness or death.  It is reported that the late Conan Doyle based his story, the hound of the Baskervilles after hearing accounts of the Cromer black shuck legends.  There is little evidence of Black Shuck causing anyone any direct psychical damage on contact but there is an intriguing account of an attack back in 1577 in the parish of Bungay, Suffolk, the parishioners were at church when it is said a violent storm broke out. The sky darkened and the church is said to have quaked when from out of no where appeared black shuck in the midst of the congregation. It ran through the church causing fear and panic among the parishioners. Two people kneeling in prayer at the time were killed instantly as the dog passed between them. A third man is said to have shrivelled up severely burned. Several miles away at around the same time in Blythburgh another black dog reputedly appeared in the church and struck three people dead and left scorch marks on the church door.

      An Old Norfolk Saying... "And a dreadful thing from the cliff did spring, And its wild bark thrill'd around, His eyes had the glow of the fires below, Twas the form of the Spectre Hound"  There are so many myths, tales, legends and sighting's of this fearsome apparition that it is hard to know where to begin. Black Shuck is said to be one of the oldest phantoms of Great Britain, with the name deriving from the Anglo-Saxon word 'scucca' meaning demon or devil.   Other historians say that the hound has its origins in Norse mythology based on the huge dog of war of Odin and Thor 'Shukir' who came over to Britain thousands of years ago along with the Vikings long-ships.  Local legend tells of a huge hound, the size of a small calf with blazing eyes, who regularly prowls the coastal path  between Sheringham and Overstrand.   Unsuspecting night walkers will first become aware of the pad pad sound of the hounds heavy paws.  Out of the corner of their eye they may see a gathering darkness, which slowly forms into the outline of a huge hound.   Lurking in the night shadows the beast is said to track the steps of its victim, drawing ever closer.   Anyone unfortunate enough to turn around and meet its fiery gaze is said to die within a twelve month period.  The hell hound of Norfolk has had many documented sighting.  In 1890 a young boy was rescued from the North Sea who told a tale of being forced to swim further and further from the shore by a huge black dog who had chased him into the sea.   Even during the 1920's and 1930's there were reports from the fishermen of Sheringham of hearing a hound howling on the cliff tops during stormy nights. As recently as 1970 a sighting of Black Shuck made the headlines. When a huge hound was seen pounding over the beach at Great Yarmouth. 1980, a young woman claimed to have met the hell hound, whilst out walking with her young son. This sighting took place near Wisbeach, though the woman said that this hound had yellow eyes, rather than red, but all of the other details were the same as that of Black Shuck.  In the village of Overstrand the old Village Sign used to show a picture of the legendary Black Shuck and to this day there is still a lane in the village which is called locally after the Norfolk hell hound.  Another of the hounds tracks runs through what today is Mill Lane into the grounds of Cromer Hall.  It is said that it was this particular locality which Arthur Conan Doyle based his Hound of the Baskervilles on.   Mythology says that 'ghost dogs' tend to haunt old straight roads which may be located on 'Leylines'.  Leylines are ancient straight paths of invisible earth energy.  Folklore says that churches would be sited on these straight lines and would be used by spirits who would travel along them from graveyard to graveyard and they were sometimes known as 'Corpse Ways'.

      Marco, Michelle and Nadia were basking in the sunshine when the conversation again quickly turned to the subject. Gay Marco joked to Michelle that Stuart might have the "change" on his mind.   "What if everything blossomed between him and you and then he turns around and goes, 'I'm really sorry Michelle but I wanna have the snip?'", he said.   The trio laughed as Shell looked on slightly bemused.   Michelle explained to Shell: "That's because we tease Nadia and say, 'Nadia do you remember when you had your operation ?'."   She added: "Nadia, did you keep it pickled in a jar afterwards?"   Looking unperturbed, Nadia buried her head in her duvet and let out a trademark howl.

      David Bowie had to stop a gig in Oslo after he was hit in the eye with a lollipop - he is ok but annoyed because no one owned up.  Meanwhile more musical madness was taking place in Russia as Sir Paul McCartney ensured good weather for his 3,000th gig by spraying dry ice on the clouds above the venue to ensure it didn't rain.   It was pouring down so the show's organisers sent up three planes with freezing agents that froze the clouds - within minutes it was bright sunshine and the band had to put on sunglasses.   Sir Paul's spokesman says he is going to try and get hold of the recipe and bring it to Glastonbury as showers are forecast for Thursday and Friday.  okay, i believe the lollipop. dumb stuff like that happens all the time. i had a friend who threw a lighter at a famous person at a concert, and it hit him in the head. i didn't appreciate that myself. stupid.  but the freezing of the clouds? O.o i hope this isn't true, and i hope it doesn't catch on sounds dangerous. i thought sir paul was into the environment. guess not.

      Tomorrow marks the 30th anniversary of the free festival at Stonehenge. "the biggest free festival in British history" story on bbc website by veterans of the festival. excerpts follow~  "Phil Russell, the orphaned son of a wealthy landowner, and Jeremy Ratter, who later co-founded the anarcho-punk band Crass, staged the first Stonehenge Free Festival during the summer solstice of 1974.  Five hundred hippies climbed a barbed wire fence erected by the Ministry of Works.  And after the solstice, a hardcore of 30 defied a court injunction to stay - for another six months.  The publicity surrounding their court case ensured the attendance doubled for the solstice the following year. "  "....the numbers continued to grow at the same rate until 70,000 people attended the 10th annual Stonehenge Free Festival on 21 June 1984. ...But the following year, the annual event's colourful history came to an abrupt end. "  Stonehenge was then closed to the  public for the next 15 years. Which to me means, well it isn't really 30 years of the free festival. It means 1974~2004 is 30 years. minus 15 of those and you've got 15 years of free festivals at Stonehenge. It's 30 years since the first group of "hippies" celebrated there. Or more to the point since Phil Russell and Jeremy Ratter did. Mr Russell is a matyr to a few people, those that remember him I'm sure, but the majority that show up probably don't have a clue who he was. 15 years of no festival there must have put an end to those fuelled by going by Phil Russell's matyrdom. (he is called a matyr in the article on bbc, so I'm going with that too out of respect..his ashes were scattered over the stones during the summer solstice of 1976. He had committed suicide,  shortly after being arrested for possession of LSD a month before that year's festival, and was institutionalised in a psychiatric hospital, and released after the 10 day festival.)  The festival is only one day long now. One day, that's it. Then you're off!   Read all about the history of the festival on the bbc web. It's quite a story.

      3. What band or artist have you not yet recorded but would very much like to? I'd love to produce either John Lennon or Otis Redding... not only because I think they were amazing but the Lazarus effect would prove my Jesus complex isn't totally out of line!   wasn't he asked who he would like to work with? as in the future? those guys are not alive dude. so it won't happen. unless there is an afterlife. maybe then you'll get a chance. not going to go into the heaven and hell matter.

      In my new home, there are Jackdaws nesting in the chimney. It's a smoke free zone, and so the living room fireplace is now home to gas fire. Now smoke to bother the Jackdaws. The pair have chicks, which must be getting quite big now. I have heard them during the night, and in the morning being very noisy. It seems they may be tucked way down there inside the chimney. They sound like puppies. Honestly, when i first heard them, I thought my next door neighbour had a tiny dog or puppy. It's a yapping sound. The parents are busy all the time, in and out of the chimney pot on the roof. The amusing thing is, every house in this street has a pair of Jackdaws nesting in their chimney. They are also my favourite bird. They are so intelligent, and quite cheeky, and brave. How do you tell a Jackdaw from the other Crow family members? Jackdaws have silvery grey feathers on their heads, so their head looks grey.  Jackdaws have also been under threat in the UK because of farming practices. And they are supposedly dwindling in numbers. Yet here away from the farms, they are thriving. There are several, perhaps 2 or 3 pairs, of Jackdaws nesting in the stones in the Stonehenge circle in Wiltshire, England. They are the birds in charge there and it is the same here

       Posted on Wed, Jun. 16, 2004  Barnes  Band's fans come out for the Darkness and into the night  HEARNE CHRISTOPHER JR.   D idn't make it to Friday's the Darkness concert at Memorial Hall? Bummer. You missed the local launch party for the next generation of heavy metal music. Blazing guitars, falsetto phonetics, a surplus of spandex — what was not to like?  “Hands up. Hands down. Hands up. Hands down,” commanded British band lead singer Justin Hawkins as the crowd obliged. “Hands up if you like swearing. Hands down. (Blank) yes.”  Maybe you had to be there. But trust me, it was cool.  Somewhere the gods of heavy-duty rock bands like Queen and AC/DC were undoubtedly smirking as Hawkins elicited women in the crowd of 1,700 to bare their chests.  “The (blank) count this evening is four in total,” Hawkins huffed.  Make that eight, I thought as I glimpsed toward the balcony and noticed a young man and his size-large female friend add their ballast to the total.  As for the show itself, “it's a great, fun time,” chirped mother of two going on three Jessica Kerrigan. “My husband bought the CD. He was a fan first. He's an attorney at Blackwell Sanders.”  The reason for the button-down, 30-something Kerrigans' presence at the show:  “I wasn't old enough to go when it was Boston and Queen,” Kerrigan says.  Then there were the concert fashions …  “There're some interesting outfits here tonight,” noted Brooksider Lizzie Larson, a senior at Columbia College. “The girl in front of us, coming in, had on a miniskirt that was falling off and a turquoise thong. And she kept tugging both of them up.”  “Rock 'n' roll coming back,” was Clear Channel promoter Jeff Fortier's review of the show.  Is the Darkness Fortier's personal musical preference?  “It depends on how many cocktails I've had,” he quipped.  The crowd had a little something for everyone, Larson observed.  “You know, (the crowd) is sort of the emo fans (emotional rock) and the biker bar gals with a lot of miles on them with their third husbands,” she says. “But it was great! The emo kids are the Depeche Mode and Cure fans of the 21st century.”  Michelle Le, a senior at George Washington University, had her own odd-crowd encounter.  “The mom that was in front of us,” Le says. “She was trying to be the best-friend mom who (says), like, ‘You can talk to me about sex and drugs.' She had really bad blond highlights and fake boobs. She was drunk. She brought alcohol in a baggie. It was clear. But her (teenage) daughter liked her a lot.”  Like I said, you had to be there

      David Bowie and The Darkness have been confirmed as the headliners for this year's OXEGEN, the festival formerly known as Witnness.  The festival takes place at Punchestown Racecourse in Kildare on Saturday 10 and Sunday 11 July, subject to licence. One-day tickets are priced at €59.50, two-day tickets are €110.00 with a two-day ticket including camping €130.00.  that's euros. not pounds. i hope mr.bowie will be recovered by then. wish i could go to that fest.    see?  28 June 2004 Bowie forced to cancel further shows  David Bowie has been forced to cancel further appearances after being hospitalised due to an ongoing shoulder injury.  Bowie cut short a concert in Prague last Wednesday because of pain caused by a pinched nerve in his shoulder.   He played a set at the Hurricane Festival in Scheessel, in Germany, on Friday night but complained of pain afterwards.  He was then forced to cancel his scheduled appearances at the Southside Festival in Neuhausen ob Eck, also in Germany, because of further shoulder problems.    at first, i though it was because of the lollipop incident.

      In some I'm sure.  For some people. Look this is another ass umption. It goes a little something like this. "That person likes rock, therefore that person is a rebel" (or is rebelling) But get this one. I was asked at my first job. during the training. why was i a punk when i was younger?I and before i answered i was told, it's because you were rebelling against your parents.  I replied, and truthfully so, no my parents encouraged me.

       21 July 2003 The Darkness - Permission To Land   Must Destroy - 2003 - 38 minutes  Heavy rock can offer freedom in two ways. For fans there's the sense of rebellion the best songs and bands deliver when you crank them up. And to music snobs, it's a target to point and scoff as they congratulatethemselves for being 'blessed' with such taste and having the prescience to buy Dylan's 'Blood on the Tracks' when they were 10. The Darkness will pull in plenty of the latter; for those still hopelessly devoted to the genre, 'Permission to Land' has novelty record riffen all over it.   There are some class moments and The Darkness take their cues from the best, but running out of oomph halfway through a 38-minute record says they're not going to end up on 'Classic Albums' like many of their heroes. Singer Justin Hawkins voice sounds like he could have been a choirboy long after nature had taken its course, and while it works well on stuff as strong as 'Black Shuck' and 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love', 'Love on the Rocks With No Ice' isn't near as cool as the title while 'Holding My Own' recalls the work of poodle haired rockers.   Half of these songs deserve to be on any compilation tape, 100 bands still hanging around from the 80s could write way better than the others. This is fun but a million lighters away from Whitesnake's 'Still of the Night'.  Harry Guerin  Tracklisting: Black Shuck - Get Your Hands Off MY Woman - Growing On Me - I Believe In A Thing Called Love - Love Is Only A Feeling - Givin' Up - Stuck In A Rut - Friday Night - Love on The Rocks With No Ice - Holding My Own   1. Whitesnake? I had forgotten they existed. What did they sing anyway? Again. a moment of shock. pulling myself together, as I astounded anyone recalls this band. I had totally forgotten them. Another MTV when it was young band, never received much applause at all. Did they have fans? Again, I sat waiting for The Cure to come on MTV and went to get a snack during Whitesnake, or Poison, almost all those bands. Once in a while I'd see their videos whiel I was waiting ready to leap upon my VCR record/play button when something I liked came on. 2. Whitesnake? :O Still of the night? no still doesn't ring a bell? 3.Whitesnake? O.o nooooo. lighters at a Whitesnake concert? he actually went to see them it seems. no. i can't believe it. i just can't. Whitesnake vs the Darkness? any other dumb arse comparisons. anyone? 4. Is this dude saying Whitesnake wrote good songs? I mean more than other 80's bands?  Still trying to think of anything they wrote...or how the song he mentioned goes. not coming to me. 5. man they were naf. i mean always were. not after the fact. (my opinion) 6. this is 2004. 7. it is not the 80s. 8. really it isn't the 80's. not the 80's. chant it 200 times at once. 9. out of the time warp yet?

       Being There : The Darkness : Scene Pavilion | Tuesday, June 15 By Jeff Niesel 	Wednesday, June 23, 2004   ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Darkness' Justin Hawkins The singer-guitarist is no David Lee Roth.  The music biz works in mysterious ways . Just a couple months ago, the Darkness was the hottest act on the circuit. As soon as the tickets for its Cleveland debut went on sale, the U.K. hard-rock act had sold out Peabody's and then, after the show was moved to a bigger venue, the Agora. Tickets were being hawked at 10 times their face value on eBay. Then the group canceled when singer-guitarist Justin Hawkins blew out his voice. The hype deflated at a record pace. Case in point — scalpers were selling tickets for 10 bucks outside this gig at Scene Pavilion. While there were likely a good 3,000 fans at the show, there was a palpable lack of energy, both onstage and off.   When the Darkness finally arrived and began playing behind a white curtain that showed Hawkins' silhouette, the opening instrumental didn't do anything to move the crowd. And once the curtain fell, Hawkins didn't emerge as a showman capable of taking things over the top like David Lee Roth used to. While concert footage often makes it look like he can jump high enough to leap tall buildings in a single bound, in reality, he wasn't superhuman. The fact that the group played the schmaltzy ballad, “Love is Only a Feeling,” a mere six songs into the set didn't help matters either.   It wasn't until mid-set when the band broke into “Get Your Hands Off My Woman” that things finally clicked. The track featured Hawkins' vocal theatrics and finally confirmed all those comparisons to Freddie Mercury. Afterward, Hawkins even issued a “formal frank apology” for canceling the last show and then reemerged in a new set of purple spandex pants. “Friday Night” was dead on, and the set concluded with a raucous rendition of the band's big hit, “I Believe in a Thing Called Love.” If this show had taken place at either Peabody's or the Agora or in any club setting, for that matter, it would have worked. Bu it was a much harder sell at an outdoor amphitheater because in the end, the Darkness plays arena rock but can't really rock the arena.   The Wildhearts opened with a set that would have gone over better with a classic- rock crowd, as tunes such as “Vanilla Radio” and “So Into You” showed a clear debt to acts such as Cheap Trick and Aerosmith. It didn't help that singer Ginger shamelessly encouraged fans to buy the new album at the merch table, lending new meaning to the phrase “shut up and play.”    1. who told this man to expect david lee roth instead of justin hawkins? or is he just deluded and expected david lee roth because david lee roth wore spandex, and so does justin? 2. i have never liked david lee roth. apologies to his fans, but we all have our own taste. 3. if i'm reading about the darkness in a newspaper, why so i want to hear a rant about mr. roth. if you're going to mainly go on about that, title your review david lee roth..aww man i think he is so cool..or something to that effect. 4. why expect someone to be anyone else in the first place? david does not equal justin. illogical. 5. what does schmaltzy mean? i have a feeling david lee roth was especially schmaltzy. recalling him on mtv back in the 80's. recalling how i wished they'd stop putting him on so much. he creeped me out while i sat waiting for  an adam and the ants' video to come on. 6. this one says justin warrants comparisons to freddie. look people can you think of some actual adjectives to describe someone? a dictionary and a thesaurus may be good places to start. you should have them already since you're a journalist. 7. sadly hardly anyone is better (or even good) at a big stadium. and club gigs are always better if you're in the audience. one day people will realise how much big stadium shows suck, even when the show is a "big stadium rock bands"  then people will play more shows at smaller venues, and people will be much happier. 8. this shows how shallow the majority of people with money to spend on shows can be. yes, and fickle. agreed with the writer there. fickle music biz. just think of what the media did to adam ant. talk you up so much,too much too often,then slam you down in a personal fashion.  9. justin is a human. he isn't superman. see people are human beings, that don't have superman's abilities. that's comic book fiction. or tv fiction, and cheap special effects in films. hope that ones been straightened out. superhumans like superman do not really exist.

      like being ripped off so much in the uk is news. but look at the price of the tickets to see shows in the states, and canada! and the music festivals too. going to one here is like going on a holiday. all i want to do is see a band live, listen to the music, be able to see them.  not just on big screens either. more shows. smaller venues. less bands all playing at the same time. same place. like someone said they did at glastonbury last year. running around like a blue arsed fly trying to see all the bands. well you want your money's worth right? :)

        	Posted on Fri, Jun. 25, 2004     I M A G E S     The Darkness Only by seeing the Darkness can retro fans see the light  BY JIM ABBOTT Orlando Sentinel   With his feathered cat-suits, over-the-top falsetto and the defiantly retro arena-rock of his band the Darkness, singer Justin Hawkins invites parody.  Just be careful with the comparisons: AC/DC and Queen are fine enough, but Spinal Tap raises the singer's hackles — even if the band's amplifiers sound like they go to 11.  "That comes only from journalists who don't know anything about rock, someone who has only watched 'Spinal Tap' and 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' and starts writing for an indie paper," Hawkins says by phone from London. "Anybody who says we can't write songs is, frankly, lying."  More than image, the secret to the Darkness is the unexpected quality of its "Permission to Land" debut. The band followed the validation of selling 2.6 million copies worldwide by taking Britain's Ivor Award in May for the year's best songwriting. The Darkness makes its Twin Cities debut tonight at Roy Wilkins Auditorium in St. Paul.  "I can't get that miserable about things when there are people in certain corridors that appreciate what we do," Hawkins says, using a very nasty word to dismiss those who don't respect the band's talent.  "They still need a piece of us to sell their magazines," he sniffs, then stops to reconsider. "Does that sound arrogant? Ah well, there's nothing worse than false modesty."  It certainly doesn't become a rock star whose band has sparked followers ranging from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to comedian Jack Black. The latter, who embraces rock's broad comedic possibilities in cult favorite Tenacious D, has described the Darkness as a welcome throwback.  "A delicious fresh breeze in an otherwise stale rock landscape," Black told Entertainment Weekly.  Not everyone has been so supportive. The band never even considered Hawkins as lead vocalist until his rendition of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" at a Millennium Eve karaoke contest opened the eyes of his guitarist brother, Dan Hawkins. Early British club shows inspired record company scouts to head for the exits.  Another band might have been devastated, but Hawkins was energized.  "It was encouraging because it's always the bands that struggle that have enduring longevity," he says. "Cream, Aerosmith, bands like that."  While he doesn't dismiss every band that follows a trend, Hawkins didn't want the baggage that came with being part of a hot new sound. He envisioned the Darkness as something different, even if it sounded like band members had raided their parents' 1970s and '80s vinyl collection.  "I'd rather be compared to 1970s and '80s bands than any 1990s bands because there's no one in the 1990s that we'd aspire to be like," Hawkins says. That ego resurfaces in his assessment of the band's impact in its native Great Britain.  "I think it's akin to Nirvana. When Nirvana came along, everything that came along next sounded like a watered-down version. Every now and then, there's a band that... shows that music doesn't have to be formulaic."  Or at least can revive a different formula. Besides, if the soaring vocals and monster guitars on the MTV-driven "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" or "Get Your Hands Off My Woman" are derivative, they also happen to be genuinely memorable.  And, for all his bluster, Hawkins is surprisingly magnanimous about the angst-ridden emo bands and earnest, shoe-gazing indie-rockers that contrast so starkly with the overt showmanship of the Darkness. He loves Radiohead.  "Jeff Buckley was good, wasn't he? There's good and bad in just about any kind of music, but I'd say with the words "earnest' and "entertainment,' it's hard to get both in the same sentence really.  "Still, I would never say that I hate any band," he says. "There's people I hate, but there is room for everybody."  Among the people that Hawkins dislikes are the members of Staind, who tried to have the Darkness yanked from the radio playlist at K-Rock in New York.  "They tried to get us off because they didn't want to be on a station that played the Darkness," Hawkins says. "They think we're a joke."  He utters another very dirty word, then softens his tone: "I would never do something like that. That's really wrong."  Despite that controversy, the Darkness is still on the air in New York and elsewhere. Hawkins is optimistic enough to be shopping for a few rock-star perks.  A mansion?  "I looked at one this morning," he says, "but I'm really looking at cars now."  He has narrowed the search to "a Jag, the only true British car really. I'll deal with the mansion later."  Who: The Darkness  When: 7:30 p.m. June 25  Where: Roy Wilkins Auditorium at RiverCentre, 175 W. Kellogg Blvd., St. Paul  Tickets: $24.50  Call: 651-989-5151    1. i am sure most of this interview material is from elsewhere. i know i've read it a few times before.yet there are no references. gee man! (lol) aren't you supposed to not plagiarise, and to put references? 2. who are the Staind?  3. i couldn't stand krock when i lived in the tri-state area. they didn't really rock much. maybe things have changed. that was in the 80's and early 90's i'm talking about. 4. had enough of all the comparisons. one of these days someone will write about them without comparing them to another rock band! it will be shocking to all. 5. at least they are all kind enough to give details of the upcoming show in their area, and get people interested.

       Last update: June 24, 2004 at 1:30 PM Pop/rock spotlight: The Darkness  June 25, 2004 POP0625   TONIGHT: Whether or not you believe in a thing called love, as the Darkness' hit single calls for, it's probably worth believing in this wildly hyped British glam-rock band. The coy, innuendo-laden songs and genuine rock oomph of its 2003 debut, "Permission to Land," would sound great even if singer Justin Hawkins didn't sing like Freddie Mercury and wear those tight, "Spinal Tap"-worthy jumpsuits. The quartet's stage show is said to be quite a hoot, too. Or at least it's better than a puppet show. The Wildhearts open. (7:30 p.m. today, Roy Wilkins Auditorium, 5th & Washington Sts., St. Paul. $26. 651-989-5151.) Chris Riemenschneider    1. justin does not sing like freddie mercury. you can tell the difference easily. 2, is singing like freddie mercury did a bad thing? 3. did spinal tap wear catsuits, oops sorry "jumpsuits"? i just watched it on tv and i didn't notice any jumpsuits. a bit of spandex which is figure hugging, yes. but lots of other fabrics as well.  4. a hoot better than a puppet show...i can't think of a worthy comment for that. ony what a stupid thing to say. where did he get that from? does this Chris often go to puppet shows then?

Bill Howard, 62, collapsed at 0115 BST on Monday near the main Pyramid stage, soon after his son's rock band Muse performed Sunday's headlining set.   Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious and asked for privacy for the Howard family.   The Devon band have cancelled a show booked for Wednesday in Bergamo, Italy.      In this dreadfully difficult time, we request that the privacy of Dom's family and friends is respected     Statement from Muse    Muse have yet to decide whether other shows will go ahead as planned.   The trio from Teignmouth, who also include singer Matt Bellamy and bassist Chris Wolstenhome, were the top act on the main stage on Glastonbury's third and final night.   Bill Howard was pronounced dead at the Festival Medical Centre half an hour after he collapsed.   A statement released on behalf of the band said: "Mr Howard collapsed on site at 0115 BST and died shortly after. Avon and Somerset Police are not treating the death as suspicious.   Second death   "In this dreadfully difficult time, we request that the privacy of Dom's family and friends is respected. Our sincere and heartfelt sympathy extends to Dominic and the Howard family."   Somerset and Avon Police confirmed they were not treating the death as suspicious.   A second death at the festival, of Neil Clinnings, 24, from Cleveleys in Lancashire, is believed to be drug related.   He was found collapsed in the early hours of Saturday in a car park near the festival site.   (source bbc website)   i was just talking about that  again to someone last night, about the someone is going to die at glastonbury thing. this is very sad.

      i have guitar lessons now every Friday at noon.  i also practice every day, even if i feel crappy, or ill. and with these allergies that bloody all the time. almost.   so today i have learned two songs. on my fender strat squier, left-handed, sunburst. (yummy but more about that later)  my first lesson, i learned 3 chords. my second, i learned 2 more chords. and also had some exercises to do. strumming and chord changing. then today i have put those together to learn to songs.  "He's got the whole world in his hands" and "Hush Little Baby" Simple tunes for me of course! And songs I know well from my childhood. So now I am changing chords and strumming actual songs and singing. Funny how such simple songs are so satisfying and better when you're playing them, especially when you couldn't play a thing before.  also, i have a tuner, so i use that for tuning. somehow i managed to figure that out myself when i first got the guitar, but the teacher always tunes it a little before each lesson.  i can tell when it's out of tune pretty well, and adjust it close now, but i still check it with the tuner afterwards. sure that'll improve.  oh, also now doing finger walking up and down so exercise my fingers.  it sounds pretty cool too.  can't help playing around with it, and see what sounds you can make. :)  my fingers on my right hand (remember i play lefty) have been hurting. a little sore, but not too bad. i kept practicing, and already they're adapting. the third finger was adapted long ago. that was when i chop the tip off it of while mowing the lawn. I should say the lawn mower blade chopped the tip off. so the skin healed over quite hard, guess it's scar tissue. it isn't sensitive at the tip like my other fingers, but i can still feel (sense) with it.  my thumb and wrist were hurting a bit too. but again, they hurt often anyway. from falling off a horse a long time ago. the horse bucked me off into a tree, when it saw a snake.   back to guitar. so there i was after my teacher left playing hush little baby over and over..zzzzz....sent myself all dosey.. it's a lullaby!! the dog who had been jumping around dosed off suddenly while I was playing it.   the power of music!  now i need something to snap me out of this sleepiness!

      Finally getting somewhere with making a website. David did the mystical isle of avalon theme.  He's had that theme running through things on the net for years now. groups, forums.webs...so he continued with that on my web. I was getting rather frustrated at the time I first got the webhosting, had some arguments with the first people I chose. That put me off for a while, and so did figuring out all the various items on the new host. I was so used to using geocities, which I find quite easy, now I know a good bit of html. Not enough to be a "web designer" mind you, and still learning. Changing over meant learning a new hosts odds and ends, and  I just wanted to get in there and html it all of course! The geocities set up was second nature.  But now I'm getting the hang of it a bit more.

      i can say this. i think they do. my opinion. i have a variety of reasons for this, all from my OWN observations of the NME. (new musical express becomes the enemy..good healine pun there..o.o, so tabloid) how about NME is SHITE. that's better.  where's the bloody music in it. all they yap about is drugs, mainly about shrooms in this past issue. worse they are advertising shrooms because they are outright saying shrooms are cool. see?  what to ads do?  they say: this is the coolest in thing to do, and have, and if you don't have it you will no longer be in the human race, and will be kicked out, and ostracised, bullied, left out, made fun of, your life will be sheer hell because of it...so you better bloody buy our product now! see? NME and drugs~shrooms, oooo how cool, we don't say mushrooms, becaues the druggie word for them is shrooms. we are so IN. god i hate them. oh "pills" are IN. what kind" who knows? just take PILLS PILLS and more pills of any kind...i am being facetious, sarcastic, and bitchy there. I am not saying take them. NME says that. okay, what else? drink until you die, fall over in a coma, shag anyone anywhere, and take any sodding drug you can get your hands on. eat pills like they're candy. pass out in the mud. die of an overdose. feel like a total arsehole. do things you actually do regret later, maybe not the day after...but it'll get ya...hahahahaha!  okay. now they have said "The Darkness are JUMPING FOR JOY that Bowie cancelled" Yeah, okay enemy (NME WILL BE SO CALLED FROM NOW ON) make them look like they are happy Bowie is ill. with your lame puns.

      it's being claimed that justin hawkins spent that much in a catsuit, and that he is quoted as saying he got it for T in the park, and is using the same tailor as Bowie. wow, i said that in about one 20th of the words they used in the news article! man they must add a ton of shite in. alrighty then: 1~justin has been quoted before as saying he used to make his own catsuits. 2~surely he didn't make all the new ones like the ones with tails and applique on. 3~is he making yet another joke about wastage of rock stars and celebrities. 4~i mean if the man toured his butt off in his homemade catsuits, then £20,000 is obviously excessive and a joke.  all these jokes, and ppl taking him seriously. i mean he told them that info. did they even bother to verify it? nooooo!  bad journalism. bad bad bad....  rumours taken as truth. lmao.  at the top it should carry a warning on news  items, or papers :WARNING MOST IF NOT ALL OF THIS IS LIES. ( i was going to use the word FABRICATION, but went with a word we all understand. I mean fabrication. it sounds like a tailor's word)

       Friday July 9, 02:49 PM  	 Sewage turning British fish female  LONDON (Reuters) - British fish are changing sex due to sewage in rivers that contains large amounts of female hormones, the Environment Agency says.  In a report on the latest stage of 20 years of research on Friday, it said that in a survey of 1,500 fish at 50 locations, one-third of the males showed female characteristics.  The agency which monitors environmental pollution said the sex changes were a result of the fish being exposed to treated sewage which still contained hormones produced naturally by women or as a result of them taking the contraceptive pill.  "There is sufficient evidence of harm to fish caused by sewage effluent that action needs to be taken now to find out how to control this," Andrew Skinner, director of environmental protection at the agency, said in a statement.  "We need to find out what is the best and most cost-effective way to remove these chemicals from sewage," he added.  It named the offending natural hormones as oestradiol and oestrone, and the synthetic culprit as ethinyloestradiol.  It said the findings had serious implication for future fish populations because anything more than a moderate change in a fish's sexual organs made it more difficult to reproduce.  The Environment Agency noted that while the phenomenon was being seen worldwide, Britain had the most comprehensive data on it.   somehow i think this has a bit more to do with hormones in sewage from women naturally, and women on contraceptive pill.  here's a coincidence: watching DUNEWATCH the film. pituitary growth hormone (similar to it) found in fish. suspect dumping. radioactive waste. testing it on dogs of all creatures for some reason. dogs? O.o dogs are attacking ppl in the woods you see. well well well.   i do think these hormones or synthetic ones akin to them are used in other chemicals. check it out. thinking...pesticides...along those lines.

      too boring. dosing off....  i did find the suspect CD amongst that lot on there. plus all kinds of bits and pieces. unofficial stuff. mirrors. keychain bottle openers. signed stuff. tees not seen elsewhere, and i guess are also "unofficial"  whatever.. i'd get my stuff from their website.  how do these people get this signed stuff, and even if it says stuff like "COA" whatever ignoramus me doesn't know the exact meaning of that, but it's certified. like comes with a certificate of authentication. who authenticates that stuff?  i know that's done with comic books. costs ya for it too. so the price of the comic that's been rated by a person that's an official rater, and gives it a certificate, is higher.  but who authenticates music memorabilia? hmm?

      my new toy is a pink elephant electric toothbrush for kids. it's really battery powered by 2 AAA batteries. now this thing is the business. 1~it's a pink elephant 2~it's a very soft and small toothbrush. 3~it cleans my teeth better than anything else i have ever used. including fancy adult electric toothbrushes. 4~it is so soft you can massage your gums with out them bleeding. 5~it's small so you can get it in your mouth  to the nard to reach parts. 6~my teeth feel like i've just had them professionally cleaned. 7~not much effort or time involved. 8~it's also useful for massaging other parts of my face that have been injured. yes i clean it first.  9~my nose was broken when i was 13, and i've had all sorts of problems since then. even going to a physiotherapist for my jaw, which was affected by the nose injury. but low and behold, the pink elephant toothbrush works better as in provides more relief than the fancy sound stuff or whatever it was they were doing, that actually hurt like hell, and left my whole skull vibrating for hours. 10~that physio also didn't work, but hey lil pink toothbrush does, and on my nose too.  11~it cost just over £3.00 in my local chemist!!!  14~i've just notice, that where i used it on my left jaw joint (where i have TMJ) and the left side of my nose, are nice and soft. something like this would be good for the skin and circulation. i'm sure. 15~i loathe those massage things you can buy that are supposed to relief pain, they don't. they're annoying, and cost loads. 16~damn a kid's electric toothbrush people! for £3.00..batteries still haven't run out....

      people are hilarious. but at the same time it's scary. i see they haven't added my comments to the thing, but i guess the page is full up. i did put my two cents in a while back.  it's odd people that call themselves "punk" are bitching about the Darkness so much. really is odd that rather than bitching about the music, they say people that listen to the band should be shot. i don't know about you but capital punishment for the music you listen to is a bit harsh. these kids must be horrors at school. you aren't punk, and i am na na na na na..

      The darkness. I swore it. I said, no more darkness on your blog. because there's plenty of darkness stuff around already for people to see. especially right now with the us tour having been on..well soon they're in bonnie scotland. t in the park. seen today, amongst all the darkness madness: if you can't have justin's guitar..then have the miniature one. lol. i dunno, i think those mini ones are funny as hell.    The perfect gift for a fan of The Darkness New in stock - fantastic replicas of the original! Probably the second most famous guitar in the world, Les Pauls have been used by countless artists. This replica of the White Les Paul with gold hardware as used by Justin Hawkins is made from high-quality fibre, making it feel quite heavy. Comes complete with adjustable display stand which will prevent guitar from falling. All approx. 9" (23cm) long.    wonder when they'll start making guitar replica vibrators?!  and hey if anyone does, that's my idea!  i'm patenting it.

           Ahhh, the Darkness, that Brit-bred band of glammy revivalists and their seductive aura of next-big-thingness who opted to bypass OC altogether on this tour, thereby forcing us to trek down to San Diego to engage them in a proper sonic deconstruction. This would take all of 12 seconds for anyone with even the sparsest knowledge of rock & roll history. But let’s lay down a thesis first: we love the Darkness; we get the Darkness, and we can’t stop guffawing at all our rock-critic peers who are as nutjobby over them as we are, when, in 1974 or so, bands like the Darkness were the bane of a rock critic’s existence. The rise of the Darkness is related directly to the Great Hanson Phenomenon of 1997. That year, critics raved about the bubblegummy Osmonds-sound-alike tune "MMMBop"; if the Osmonds had released the same song in 1972, music scribes the globe over would have spent the equivalent of Iraqi’s annual oil production condemning it in breathless this-crap-is-killing-rock-&-roll! columns.  It’s an embrace of nostalgia and an acknowledgement that our first reactions are sometimes overreactions. Throw in the teen and preteen demographics, for which a band like the Darkness is completely new (there’s even a teenage Darkness tribute band in OC!), and you’re looking at a gargantuan rock & roll moneymaker.  Critics may love the Darkness, but critics hated their influences, the Queen-Zep-AC/DC-Slade-Thin Lizzy theme (with a dash of David Lee Roth on the side, if only for front man Justin Hawkins’ leaping leg splits). But critics don’t buy tickets, and regular folks are buying them up at every Darkness tour stop. They are that ultra-rare rock & roll entity—a new, young band that’s winning over parents and their kids. At this gig, the age range looked to be from 6 to 60, the kids borrowing their mom’s old "For Those About to Rock, We Salute You!" T-shirts they were probably conceived in.  The Darkness are Spinal Tap minus irony, campiness without shame, a band that embraces each clichéd rock & roll pose as if they invented it—from the huge sheet they draped in front of the stage in order to make their grand, pompous, silhouettes-and-spotlights entrance, to the skintight trousers and naked-torso-exposing jump suit costumes (not to mention the purple feather boa and hair-held-back-by-bandanna accoutrements).  There was fey Hawkins and his greatest attribute, a Freddie Mercury-castrato voice that’s the band’s centerpiece, along with the Brian May Gibson guitar crunches of his brother Dan. There was crotch-thrusting a-plenty and other naughty bits, such as when Justin asked for (and got) various barely legal women in the audience to hoist their shirts up, and when he coerced a 13-year-old boy to yell, "FUCK!" into his microphone (as the tyke’s pop gazed on proudly), the kid later hopping onstage to lead the crowd in a "MOTHER! FUCKER!" chant. (Justin also got everybody to yell, "CUNT!" for no particular reason.) There were those great, riff-heavy tunes, like their America-conquering epic "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" and "Holding My Own," a histrionic power ballad about wanking performed without a trace of humor. (Contrast that with the very funny power ballad "Love Is Only a Feeling," which Justin introduced with a lesson on proper cigarette-lighter choreography.) And there were Justin’s totally kiss-ass shout-outs to the locals ("San Diego! A bit like Los Angeles but infinitely cooler!" which you bet gets slightly altered in every town the Darkness hits—"Hello, Cleveland!"). There was their love song to smack-shooting, "Givin’ Up," and their fantastic double-entendre "Growing On Me," which is either about being stalked by a hot chick or enduring a nasty bout of pubic lice (you decide: "I wanna shake you off, but you just won’t go/And you’re all over me, but I don’t want anyone to know/That you’re attached to me, that’s how you’ve grown/Won’t you leave me, leave me, leave me alone?"). Somebody—one of their roadies?— threw panties at them.  They didn’t put on a rock & roll show so much as perform a Smithsonian-worthy rock & roll experience. The Darkness are what happens when that Queen or AC/DC tribute band you hire for your party starts doing its own songs, hoping everybody’s too tanked to notice, but nobody winds up caring anyway because they’re too busy worshiping the riffs and throwing the Satan sign. Will the Darkness’ lifespan extend beyond a second album? No way. As much as the band hates to hear it, they’re strictly novelty, destined to be artistically imprisoned by the nostalgia they manufacture. But for now, they sure are a helluva lotta fun.

      at t in the park. to replace david bowie.  what i want to know is: why does the woman below lapse into a rant about a Sparks gig she went to? wasn't the piece about t in the park and the darkness, and bowie?  and if she had a reason to rant, she didn't make it clear.  besides, i do recall Sparks, and I did know they were around, and like her I'd rather go to a small gig than a huge sprawling festival. or even a big stadium gig.   what i don't like about fests, has been well demonstrated by this bowie business. if i want to see say david bowie, i want a ticket that specifically is for david bowie. for a bowie concert. so i know that's what i am getting. and if he cancels for whatever reason, i get a refund, and can get tickets for a future gig of his when it happens. it's cancelled, okay you lot get the tickets first for the gig in x place and x date. to see the show you paid for. not someone else.  or wandering around aimlessly....  i want music, not massages and clowns etc.  i can get those at any fecking place. bouncy castle? whoa. i can get that at a regular fairground. booths to spend all your money at? whoa! i can do that all the goddamn time in Reading!  ranting day today.  wish the music would happen elsewhere.

      Someone must shoulder the blame for Darkness debacle  SIOBHAN SYNNOT   PAGE THREE GIRL  UNDERSTANDABLY, there has been a general gnashing of teeth at the news that David Bowie has been forced to pull out of T in the Park with a trapped nerve. Who could replace Dame David as the headline act at Kinross’ Canterbury-like fusion of carnival and spiritual impulses?   Not The Darkness that’s for sure. Yet this is the clumsy swap imposed by the organisers. To 30,000 ticketholders this is like losing a tenner and finding a ticket to the Singing Kettle in your pocket.   As an event, T in the Park is usually a festival of frothing exuberance set in neo-brutalist surroundings. Or if you prefer, it’s two days of bands in a big field in the height of Scotland’s whimsical summer weather - so those bands better be good.   Bowie’s 30-year career may include vertiginous heights and plummeting falls but he remains a far more exciting and invigorating proposition than modishly camp The Darkness, a band who, current releases suggest, consist of one Freddie Mercury fan and three John Deacons.   The top spot at music festivals is traditionally reserved for pop music’s shaggiest eminences grise - Paul McCartney played Glastonbury last weekend for instance - and yet often the rock world does not appear to rate long and steadfast service as highly as, say, the gas board or an insurance company.   In fact, the longer you linger, the less respected you become; pop’s version of the carriage clock is grudgingly given, with durability generally marked with embarrassing tight-fisted gestures. A star of Hollywood’s Walk of Fame? The stars pay for that honour themselves, and the Rock Circus wax effigies are so nondescript that tourists spend less time recalling greatest hits and more calculating whether you are meant to be Billy Joel or Roger Daltry.   Cruellest of all is the TV tribute, which reveal how few rock idols possess portraits in their attics. Nowadays Elton John looks slightly healthier than the late Leonid Brezhnev, and if Iggy Pop has had any cosmetic surgery over the years, it was apparently done at B&Q.   Even more weirdly, TV tributes to the Beach Boys suggest that while Mike Love has definitely grown older, some of the others have actually grown younger, and a couple may not have even been born when they made their first record.   So, knowing the verbal bottle-offs given to pop’s elder statesmen, it was with some trepidation that I tried to entice friends to come and see Sparks play the Royal Festival Hall last month.   "Sparks," queried one. "Aren’t they dead?" No they bloody aren’t. The Mael brothers appeared eerily unmarked by three decades and 19 albums. Russell is still the handsome-ish one with the helium falsetto, Ron is still the one who memorably scared more prepubescents than the Daleks in the 1970s, although nowadays he has swapped his Hitler moustache for a more raffish tribute to Ronald Coleman. Ron must be close to 60, yet the real signs of ageing lay with the fans; this was an older crowd, a crowd that would not enter a mosh pit unless there was reserved seating.   Certainly I cannot remember another gig where the official merchandise stall sold band-branded babygros, while other fans had brought their children along so they could have a designated driver to take them home.   Yet by the end of an invigorating run through Sparks’ latest album, L’il Beethoven, the crowd was on its feet (it would have been on its feet sooner, but it has to be careful with its back), and undoubtedly one of the highlights came when the entire crowd - not just the older fans in their fifties, but also the young folks in their thirties - joined together to sing their 1974 hit ‘This Town Ain’t Big Enough For the Both of Us’, united for the moment by the thunder of stampeding rhinos, elephants and tacky tigers, as well as our inability to dance to a guitar solo that involves gunshots.   It was a fabulous gig, and the fans were so revved up by the event that we all must have stayed up well past 11.35pm. However, Sparks illustrate the limited options for bands of a certain age and eclectic style. Only a few talents, such as Bowie or the Beatles, get to combine critical approval and album sales. Most have to settle for one or the other. If you are the Rolling Stones, you get a mansion in every continent but also the undying disdain of rock critics. If you are Sparks, you are a critical sacred cow, but a beast unknown to, and ignored by, Busted and Blue’s lucrative fanbase. And if you are The Darkness, your best bet will always lie with a dodgy shoulder and desperate rock festival.  from scotland on sunday

      well, you may think i am writing about these things cos i care. or putting the news items on here cos i give a fuck. but nope. i loathe the news. i avoid news on the tele. i never buy newpapers. and i mean never. there's some personality psychology quiz that has trick questions in it, and one is about how often do you read the newspapers. and one answer you can choose is "every day" now if you answer every day. then you get a point towards being dishonest. eg. you are a liar. one point to your lying score there.  but i consider this all stupid. my nan does read the news papers every day. 2 of them. and if she were given more she'd read them. the ppl who made and use that quiz say but that's impossible to read them every day. no it isn't my nan is evidence. so there! :P  they'd give her a lying point for saying every day. and she'd be telling the truth.  see how dopey those things are?  and that is one of the basic, widely (and wildly) used psych tests given to ppl. watch out folks.  i think an american came up with it also. so it really should then be used in america. or maybe only in certain sectors in america.  or maybe not at all.  if a counselor uses one of those, they're a shite counselor. a good one won't need it. how about they listen to you? and know about people enough without having to give tests that come up with results akin to horoscopes.  they tell you what you are like. they assume you have traits.  back to the news. i never read the newspapers. i avoid them. they make me ill. i end up picking apart all the nonsense written in them. all the false statements, sheer rubbish, bad journalism. man why did they make me take journalism at school? o.o i wanted to take art. now i have a little hobby going on of collecting material i come across on the net, and when i get around to it, picking it apart, as in answering it, for all the fallacies the item contains.  why oh why did i take philosophy?!! see what happens??!!  someone told me a while back to laugh at all the shit written in the newpapers. well, no kidding sherlock, i can't help lapsing into yankee speak once in a while....  the ones in the USA were easy to laugh at, i mean things like woman gives birth to alien, stuff like that. but here in the UK, the amount of sad, gut wrenching, morbid, morose, shite they put in them. all designed to get you riled up. omg. the poor woman that type of shit.  look. 1. it's almost definately a fabricated story. get a book instead. and make sure it's fiction. then you know where you're at. 2.fabricated means it is made up.  3. it is made up to appear like a real story, but it is false. 4. off into another area here....is that your life? is it? are those your neighbours you are reading about? your neighbourhood? your family? friends? anyone that's actually real to you? if they aren't then forget it. look around your own space. i mean actually have a look at where you live, what's around, how's things there?  can you help anyone? is anyone acting like a total shit? why do you care about ppl in the newspapers you don't even know, like rich celebs? do you really want to be like them? no. well there you are.  yes?  those are photos of people and just gossip, and how do we know what these ppl are really like? we don't. but we want to be like them. so actually we don't know what we want to be at all.  oh i'll shut up now. cos who cares?

      `Justin's the same size as me'  Jul 15 2004  By The Huddersfield Daily Examiner    You'd think a skintight catsuit would need several fittings - almost like a wedding dress.  But in the hectic world of The Darkness there's no time to stand around in half-finished garments.  Lucy, who also designs clothes for R&B star Jamelia and the Pet Shop Boys, says: "Justin's so busy, I never get any fittings with him.  "But he's the same size as me. We're both about 5ft 8ins. He might be a bit broader than me, and of course I've got a bust - though it's not very big!  "I know that if Justin's suit fits me, it'll fit him. So that's how I check, I try it on."  Sometimes the band might be at the other side of the world when a catsuit is finished, so it's just sent over.  "I'll get a phonecall saying: `It's great!' I love to be there in person when Justin tries an outfit, but I can't always be."  The rigours of Justin's energetic stage routine mean any outfit has to be tough as well as attractive.  "Justin jumps around a lot so the suits have Lycra panels for movement.  "But when they come back for a tour, they're in a terrible state. They need specialist dry-cleaning and a lot of repairs."  When Justin, 29, was a music technology student at the Tech between 1995 and 1997, he bought his Austin Powers-style clothes at charity shops.  Now, on his days off, says Lucy, he wears nothing but designerwear.  "Always Dior!" she says.  Now, the pair are working on looks that are ever more opulent.  "He's going upmarket," says Lucy. "Justin's going to look more beautiful than ever."

      All-in-one wonders  Jul 15 2004  By The Huddersfield Daily Examiner    So where does Justin Hawkins get his catsuits? JENNY PARKIN talked to the woman who knows his inside leg measurements!  WHENEVER The Darkness return from a tour, Justin Hawkins' clothes designer is in tears.  For those beautiful catsuits come back ripped, stained and sweaty.  "They're always in a terrible state," says Lucy Manning. "I just cry and cry."  She's made about 30 sparkly all-in-ones for the singer, who studied at Huddersfield Technical College before he found fame.  And his startling, sartorial statements have become a real trademark for the band.  "Everyone expects to see him wearing something really flamboyant now," says Lucy, 26. "They'd be disappointed if he didn't."  She has known Justin's brother Dan, bassist with The Darkness, since they were both teenagers.  Both Lucy - who goes out with Allan Stewart, the guitarist from indie band Idlewild - and the famous brothers come from the seaside town of Lowestoft, in Sussex.  She went to London to study fashion in London and established herself in the pop world, assisting a designer, William Baker, who dressed the likes of Kylie, Jamiroquai and Garbage.  "Yes, he put Kylie in hotpants," says Lucy. "And he did the clothes for the videos to Can't Get You Out Of My Head and Spinning Around."  One day, Lucy got a call from Dan, out of the blue - asking her for help with his band's image.  "I ummed and ahhed for ages," says Lucy. "What they wanted was really theatrical - I didn't know whether I wanted to go down that road. I wasn't sure it was me."  Finally she met Justin - who's just been voted fourth most important person in rock in a poll by Kerrang! magazine - and the pair began to put together ideas for stunning stagewear.  Lucy says: "Justin's a sweetheart, on stage he has this persona but in real life he's quiet and shy.  "We talked things through and it all started to take shape."  Both were inspired by Mick Jagger's spangly suits of the 70s as well as Freddie Mercury and Elton John's beautiful clothes that had a comical, theatrical edge.  "In the early days I used to get really cheap Lycra from the market at about 10p a metre," says Lucy.  "But now I have more money to spend we're going more and more luxurious with beautiful, soft glove leather, fake fur and the most gorgeous, expensive fabrics available."  Lucy draws up the designs with Justin's help and they're actually made by a tailor, Owen Gaster.  "There's only so many things you can do with a catsuit to keep it sexy - without turning it into a boiler suit or a leotard.  "And I think Justin's outfits are very sexy."  Lucy keeps every one of Justin's catsuits, no matter how worn-out they are.  She says she'd love to stage an exhibition of them.  A particular favourite of hers was one made for a high-profile concert supporting Robbie Williams at Knebworth. It was purple and black with a tail - a devil suit."  A different show stopper was a white and silver all-in-one for an appearance at the MTV awards. "It was covered in really expensive crystals," she says. "And Justin had a matching guitar strap, too. The whole ensemble cost thousands to make but it was worth it."  For the Brits, when The Darkness scooped several awards, Justin wore yet another amazing outfit for the show finale - in which he stood atop a big, flashing platform that rose high above the stage.  "He had this idea that he wanted a mane," says Lucy. "Yet he wanted to look like a fish. A fish with a mane.  "I was thinking of seahorses when I created this catsuit."  Lucy was there on the big night. "It was really exciting," she says. "Justin went on that platform without any safety gear. I was really worried - I wanted him to get a harness on. But he wouldn't. It was such a buzz, he thanked me on stage, which was a nice thought."  * The Darkness became firm favourites on the rock scene last year with hit singles including I Believe In A Thing Called Love and debut album Permission To Land.  * A festive single, Christmas Time (Don't Let The Bells End) sealed their popularity.  * Some sceptics didn't take their Queen-inspired sound seriously - but their universal appeal means they've had the last laugh.  * All eyes will be on what they do next to top their success so far!

      well, you can check out the webcam instead. i went there years ago, and i remember what struck me the most was all the cars driving up and down the beach, well along the beach really, as if there were a highway along it. and then everyone parked their cars, and put there towels, chairs, coolers, etc right next to their cars, and there they stayed. sitting by their cars, with all the car fumes. on a beautiful beach. and too busy. wierd.

      The Darkness are putting the finishing touches to a huge UK tour for this winter, it has been revealed.  Full details for the 18-date arena tour have yet to be confirmed but Hawkins told press that the November and December dates would end with three dates at Wembley Arena:  "The arena tour in November will also be amazing," he said. "I'm looking forward to the end of that which will finish with three dates at Wembley, although I'm not sure if that is all confirmed yet."   The band recently went into the studio to begin work on the follow-up to "Permission To Land" and will continue recording after European festival commitments across the summer, including headline slots at Reading and Leeds festivals.  In other news the band have re-recorded "Get Your Hands Off My Woman" for an American release with Cheap Trick and Queen producer Roy Thomas and are set to release their first DVD around Christmas time.

      so there's one clip of just anthony and john doing under the bridge, outside it looks like amsterdam. not sure where though. but it's like a home video close up. and john's playing the song on an acoustic guitar so amazingly. and anthony is singing, right on. and at the end after the whole song, while you're watching it in awe of john on that guitar, which i am sure anyone would be fan of his or not. after all that, he says to anthony, was that okay? i mean he says my b was flat..did it sound okay to you? and they way he says it is so well innocent. him: was it flat? anthony: no no...well along those lines it gets clipped off at that point.  there's this guy and he's just played so beautifully and he turns and asks if it was okay?

      I watched john frusciante video clips on jftab.com yesterday. first few i ws going wow, look at him go on that guitar. cos they were really close up clips, so you could see his fingers moving around like lightning. then i got to about the middle and a couple were of him obviously well doped, and it was disturbing. then it was him moving forward. and doing solo stuff, still even while with the chili peppers. there was a video done by johnny depp and it was just going around john's home, and it was so well intimate. i'm not sure what else to say right now. i just appreciated the whole thing. as my pal said, when they saw what i was looking at, "he's like a regular guy" yeah it's like you know him. no pretentions. there's something beautiful about it all.

      RHCP make millions  (Wednesday July 14, 2004 03:42 PM)  Red Hot Chili Peppers' three sold-out Hyde Park shows made $17 million [£9 million]. The June 19, 20 and 25 shows shifted a combined total of 258,000 tickets, in addition to 169,000 tickets sold for dates in Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh. The European president of promoters Clear Channel said: "It blew our minds. The first show sold out in a couple of hours, then we put up a second show and it went clean just as quickly." He added that if Hyde Park had been available for further shows: "I think we could've done another two or even three... The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an incredibly huge band in Europe." While the US has seen a downturn in ticket sales, leading to the cancellation of this summer's Lollapalooza touring festival, he added: "The European concert market is coming off one of its strongest in 50 years, with stadium show after stadium show." Red Hot Chili Peppers will release a double live album recorded at the shows, "Live In Hyde Park", in Europe, Australia, Japan and New Zealand on July 26. The track listing is:  Disc 1 1. "Intro" 2. "Can't Stop" 3. "Around the World" 4. "Scar Tissue" 5. "By The Way" 6. "Fortune Faded" 7. "I Feel Love" 8. "Otherside" 9. "Easily" 10. "Universally Speaking" 11. "Get On Top" 12. "Brandy" 13. "Don't Forget Me" 14. "Rolling Sly Stone"  Disc 2 1. "Throw Away Your Television" 2. "Leverage Of Space" 3. "Purple Stain" 4. "The Zephyr Song" 5. "Californication" 6. "Right On Time" 7. "Parallel Universe" 8. "Drum Homage Medley" 9. "Under The Bridge" 10. "Black Cross" 11. "Flea's Trumpet Treated By John" 12. "Give It Away"    so to whom exactly does all this money go? because it doesn't all go to the chili peppers. as this suggests. o.o warner bros? stadium promoters? er warner..time warner ..time warner and whoever else they are now..is it fox as well..ted turner..? okay well it's WB looney tunes anyway.

      JOHN FRUSCIANTE CONT. >>   Frusciante has many celebrity admirers. Past lovers include model-actress Milla Jovovich and art kid Stella Schnabel, and Vincent Gallo asked Frusciante him to score his controversial movie The Brown Bunny before the script was even written. "Every time I wrote something really sad I put it aside for [Gallo]," says Frusciante, insisting that despite the controversy film caused at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie is a misunderstood and beautiful masterpiece that will be appreciated in due course. None of the music he wrote made it into the actual film, but the soundtrack album (available via Tower Records... in Japan! Click here to purchase!) that accompanies The Brown Bunny will feature four of Frusciante songs. In the album's liner notes, Gallo writes: "Every day [during filming] I would listen to John's music... How and why when the film was done it did not include John Frusciante's music is difficult to explain. In a sense it is unexplainable. I did, however, make a film to John's music and John did make the music to my film."  This kind of worship and involvement in the pop-culture underground only enhances Frusciante's cult status. In keeping with this outsider mentality, he recoils at the current, corporate-influenced state of mainstream arts. "The incredible thing is that the industry of music and film are really suffering," he says. "It doesn't make any sense." Thankfully for him, he belongs to one of the most lauded bands in the world, so he needn't feel too guilty. In any case, he has the hundreds of songs in his head that he promises to record eventually. Until then, let's hope he can keep this perfect balance.   Visit www.drowninginbrown.com for more information about all things Brown Bunny, including Vincent's liner notes.   This story was published on March 24, 2004.  from papermag

      JOHN FRUSCIANTE CONT. >>   During this dark time, Frusciante released two solo albums, Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt in 1995 and Smile From the Streets You Hold in 1997 (the first for drug money, he later claimed). Both are difficult and occasionally unlistenable, but they each have moments of genius. In 1998, after rehab, Frusciante surfaced and re-joined the Chili Peppers, helping pull them out of their post-Blood Sugar Sex Magik lull on the sublime Californication. Following the years of chemical abuse and rehabilitation, Frusciante's physical appearance had changed drastically -- he had gained weight and his skin was shot, like Jim Morrison did toward the end -- but he received skin grafts to remove needle scars and a new set of teeth and soon he was back to normal. Two years later, he released the compact, beautiful solo album To Record Only Water For Ten Days.  Frusciante's fourth solo record, Shadows Collide With People (Warner Bros.), is his most accomplished yet. Alternative recording techniques and electronic sounds are pitted against his masterful guitar playing and fully-formed vocals. It is an extraordinarily open and revealing work. Melancholy lyrics indicate that he still has demons, but it seems that his prodigious talent has become less of a burden. In "Carvel", the opening track, he sings, "Heaven receives you and sends you back/ Sending a dummy to my God" and then hints at acceptance: "Up and down that's how energy stays alive/ And I wouldn't have it any other way."  Like his other solo work, Shadows is strikingly different from that of the Chili Peppers. "There are definitely people who like my solo stuff and not the Red Hot Chili Peppers. My songs are written down and that's what they are. They get recorded in an hour. I don't change anything," he says, pointing out that this is a contrast to the perfected pop of the Chili Peppers.   His raw and passionate style of "capturing" music in its most simple form has attracted collaborations, notably with the late Johnny Cash. Uber-producer Rick Rubin asked the Man in Black to cover Depeche Mode's song "Personal Jesus" before he passed away last year. Upon hearing it, Cash needed help translating the electronic original into an acoustic track. Rubin contacted Frusciante, who took on the task with ease. "I recorded it in the amount of time it takes to play the song, and I sent it to Rick," Frusciante explains. "And Johnny sang along with the scratch vocal. I never met him!" The track is now available on Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around (Universal).

         There is a scene in Funky Monks, the 1992 documentary about the Red Hot Chili Peppers that was filmed during the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, where a rail-thin and anxious-looking 21-year-old John Frusciante crouches on an L.A. rooftop, expounding on his knowledge of the "fourth dimension" to the camera. He has a shaven head and he squints in the sunlight. Some months later, Frusciante left the Chili Peppers altogether. Now, twelve years later, Frusciante is at a stage in his life where he can take his own time in the studio to record his solo work. Upon being asked when he started recording his upcoming LP, Shadows Collide With People, Frusciante says it was "when Radiohead were across the hall recording their latest album" and between the Chili Peppers' Californication and By The Way tours. That would be somewhere in between May 1999 to June 2002 to you and me, but Frusciante does not reason like the rest of us.  At 18 years old, in 1988, Frusciante clinched the lead-guitar slot in his favorite band, local L.A. scenesters the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He helped propel them into rock history with his songwriting -- though he shared co-writing credits with bandmates Flea, Anthony Keidis and Chad Smith on virtually every Blood Sugar Sex Magik tune, his guitar-playing was the driving force on brilliant hits like "Under The Bridge" and "Breaking The Girl." Then, in the middle of their world tour for that album, he quit, dropping out of the Hollywood limelight almost completely. Rumors swirled of madness, death and suicide, and the truth was not far off.  Frusciante famously holed himself up in the Hollywood Hills for three years, bent on heroin addiction. His self-abuse became so legendary that friends like Johnny Depp and the lead singer of the Butthole Surfers, Gibby Haynes, made a short film, Stuff, about a day in Frusciante's life -- a harrowing testament to the demise of the tortured creative mind. Never released, the movie is available on the internet at www.jftab.com.

      "If paparazzi shots of Britney Spears picking her nose and Hillary Duff getting a parking ticket just aren't doing it for you anymore, and the pages of In Touch magazine seem nothing more than a blur of neon captions, exclamation points and arrows pointing to thongs sticking out of sweat suits, fret you not. Thanks to French photo-journalists Pascal Rostain, 45 and Bruno Mouron, 50, there is now a new, improved, even more intrusive and stalker-like way to idolize and relate to your favorite celebrities. For the past 14 years, the Paris Match photographers, armed with a celebrity star map and a pair of rubber gloves, have been waiting til the sun goes down to rifle through, collect, and photograph celebrity garbage. That's right: trash, refuse, waste, Governor Schwarzenegger's empty Newman's Own Lemonade cartons. And through July 16, at the Star Trash Store in Manhattan, you can view Star Trash, an exhibit of photographs documenting 25 Hollywood superstars' waste products, including (but not limited to) Madonna's empty Cocoa Pebbles box, Mel Gibson's discarded Etch-A-Sketch, and Steven Spielberg's tattered copy of TV Guide. "  seeing the pics, i'm thinking at least a few of these celebs, knew these guys were looking in their trash that day, and put in photos of themselves, and kids. i mean throwing away perfectly good photos of yourself, when you're Arnie? and it isn't exactly the most avant garde thing to do now. ppl have been going through celeb trash for years. whoopee! nothing very exciting here. except Ronald Reagan's rubbish bin contained a white bra. nancy's?

      Rolling Stone: "Frusciante Prepares a Feast" John on the beauty of imperfection and his new albums  John Frusciante will release six albums over the next six months, starting with the new The Will to Death . On his previous albums, as recently as last year's Shadows Collide With People, the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist felt the need to make his recordings technically perfect, but as he listened to some of his favorite recordings, including the Rolling Stones' "Time Is On My Side," he gradually altered his approach. "Brian Jones is playing a tambourine in that song that's totally out of time," he says. "At the time I was recording Shadows Collide With People,there would be no way in hell that I'd let a tambourine like that go by. I still might not let one go by that sounds that bad, but I use stuff like that as a reference point to remember, 'If they got away with that then I can definitely get away with this.' I started to realize that the right amount of imperfections, when they're spaced evenly across a record, can be really beautiful." Read the full article at Rollingstone.com

      In Irish mythology and later Arthurian tales, women warriors teach the famous heroes chivalry, mystical wisdom (possibly Druidic lore), and feats of arms. The wooing of Emer is one such tale. Scáthach nUanaind taught the great Irish hero Cúchulainn, on the Isle of Skye, how to fight. Skye was one of many schools or academies of martial arts run by women. The myths say it takes these women a year and a day to train a hero.  These women warriors are called banaisgedaig, ban feinnidi, and bantuathaig and they are credited as having the magical power of transformation, somewhat like berserker rage, where the face is flush red and the neck and arms swell. On the whole, these female champions are described as both beautiful and courageous. These heroines were not all muscle and no brains; they were also accomplished in the arts and sciences. Sometimes referred to as Ban-faith or "prophetess" they were experts in divination and supernatural wisdom.  If these female heroines were indeed Ban-faiths, then it these warrior women were also a subclass of the Druids, just as the Faiths and Ovates were a subclass of the Druids. If this is true, then it doesn't explain why they were not exempt from military service as the male Druids were. We are not sure, but then they could have been holy warriors such as the goddess Brigid's known as "Brigand" and such were a special case. Anything is possible.   source keltia.org

      ARTHUR   (arthir) Legendary King of Britain, the traditions and literary compositions about whom form the subject matter of the following: 1. The name Arthur may be a form of Artorius , a Roman gens name, but it is possibly of Celtic origin, coming from 'artos viros' (bear man) see Welsh 'arth gwyr'. Bruce also suggests the possibility of a connection with Irish 'art' (stone) .    i still wonder myself if it came from ARD RIGH..the HIGH KING. ("irish/gaellic") ARD pronounced "ARTH" somewhere, though it says here it is pronounced ARD   for instance: how about ARDEE the town? which was "Ath Fherdia"

      The Varangian Guard  Varangians first appear in the Byzantine world in 839, when the emperor Theophilus II negotiated with them to provide a few mercenaries for his army. Although the Rus' often had peaceful trading relations with the Byzantines, Varangian raiders sometimes attacked from the north. Such attacks came in 860, 907, 911, 941, 945, 971, and finally 1043. These raids were successful only in causing the Byzantines to re-arrange their trade treaties; militarily, they were always defeated by the superior Byzantines, especially by the use of Greek fire.  The ruling class of the two powerful city-states of Novgorod and Kyiv eventually became Varangian, and the Byzantines soon acquired an official mercenary force that became the Varangian Guard. This occurred in 988, when Kyivan Prince Vladimir the Great converted to Orthodox Christianity. In exchange for a marriage to Basil II's sister Anna, Vladimir gave Basil 6,000 Varangians to use as his own personal bodyguard. The Varangian Guard was one of the fiercest and most loyal elements of the Byzantine army, as described in Anna Comnena's chronicle of the reign of her father Alexius I, the Alexiad. Their main weapon was a long axe, although they could also be used as swordsmen or archers. They were the only element of the army to successfully defend part of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, although the Guard was apparently disbanded after the city's capture in 1204. By this time, the term Varangian referred to any mercenary from northern Europe, and the Guard was probably composed more of English, Scottish and Normand mercenaries than Russians or Scandinavians.  One of the most famous members of the Varangian Guard was the future king Harald III of Norway, also known as Harald Hardrada ("Hardreign"), who arrived in Constantinople in 1035. He participated in eighteen battles and became Akolythos, the commander, of the Guard before returning home in 1043.  In contrast to the intense Viking influence in Normandy and the British Isles, Varangian culture did not survive to a great extent in the East. Instead, it was rapidly assimilated into the Slavic substrate

       {{Scandinavia}} The Varangians or Variags were Vikings who travelled eastwards from Sweden. Promoting trading, piracy and mercenary militarism, they roamed the river systems and portages of what later became Russia, reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople. They created a network of strongholds and trade posts establishing the first Russian state.  The Slavs and the Byzantines, however, did not distinguish between Scandinavians and closely related Germanic subsets, when they used this term. In the Russian Primary Chronicle, this term also includes Englishmen.   Rus'  The Varangians (Varyags, in Russian) are first mentioned by the Russian Primary Chronicle as having arrived from beyond the Baltic Sea around the mid-9th century, invited by the warring Slavic and Fennic tribes to bring peace to the region. They were led by Rurik and his two brothers Askold and Dir, who settled around the Slavic town of Novgorod. These early Varangians were likely legendary, but a real Swedish settlement, Aldeigjuborg, was established around Lake Ladoga in the 8th century. The Slavic inhabitants called these Swedes Rus.  The role of the Varangians in Russian history was an important subject of discussion in the 19th century Russian historiography. The proponents of the so-called "Norman theory" of the Russian state - including Nikolai Karamzin and, later, Sergey Pogodin - believed the claims of the Primary Chronicle that the Varangians were invited by East Slavs to rule over them and bring order. The theory was not without political implications. In Karamzin's writing the norman theory formed the basis and justification for Russian autocracy, and Pogodin used the theory to claim that the Russian state was immune to social upheavals and revolutions, because people's submission to their rulers was voluntary from the very beginning. Already in the 19th century the "Norman theory" was disputed by the more liberal sectors of the Russian society and by some Polish historians.

       Berserkers (or Berserks) were ferocious Norse warriors who had sworn allegiance to the Viking god Odin. They worked themselves into murderous fury before a battle.  The term berserker comes from Norse "baresark", meaning "bear shirt". However, it could also be translated as "bare shirt" (i.e., no shirt).  The origin of berserkers is unknown, although Tacitus mentions groups of Germanic warriors with berserk-like fury.  It appears that berserkers were religiously-inspired warbands or warrior societies. Norse sagas mention berserker gangs with twelve members where new applicants had to go through a ritualistic or real fight to be accepted. Some berserks also took names with bj rn or biorn in them in reference to a bear. This is likely to be the source of names such as Beowulf and Bodvar Bjarke.  Berserker bands' fearsome reputation and the sight of raging warriors charging headlong into battle surely had a demoralizing effect on the opposition. However, allies were wary of them as well because berserkers could decide to pillage a friendly village on their own and rape their women Snorri Sturluson mentions berserkers in Egilssaga, Hrolf's Saga and Ynglingasaga. Many sagas describe berserkers as villains who kill, loot, and plunder indiscriminately. Erik the Red might have been a berserk.  Harald Finehair, founder of the kingdom of Norway, used shock troops of berserker warriors. Grettirssaga tells that those warriors were ulfhedinn or "wolf-coats", meaning that they wore wolf skins.  Many northern kings used berserkers as part of their army of hirthmen and sometimes equivalent to a royal bodyguard. It may be that at least some of those warriors just adopted the organization or rituals of berserk warbands or used the name as a deterrent or claim of their ferocity. It is doubtful any king would have accepted a band of homicidal maniacs as his closest men.  In 1015 King Erik of Norway outlawed berserkers. Icelandic Christian law banned berserkers as heathens and sentenced them to outlawry. By the 1100's organized berserker warbands had disappeared.  Berserkers are reported to have worn bearskins in battle ? thick fur would have worked as leather armor. Bear worship was not unusual in northern Germanic areas. "Possessed" by the spirit of the bear, they might have believed they had its the strength and ferociousness and could even take the animal's shape. In that respect, they are basis of fantasy characters like Beorn in the The Hobbit.  Warriors of the Varangian Guard (Norse warriors working for Byzantine Empire) also followed bear rituals.  Berserkers fought with crazed or drugged strength, heedless of danger. They worked themselves up into a bloodlust ? berserker rage - before battles, banging their helmets with their weapons, biting their shields, and howling. They were said to be immune to pain (or even immune to weapons) in battle. In their fury they would attack their enemies but also everything else in their path, sometimes even their own people and allies.

      Theories to explain berserker behavior  Proponents of the drug theory favor ergotism or the use of the fly agaric mushroom. Drunken rage would do as well. It is also possible that berserkers worked themselves into their frenzy through purely psychological processes ? i.e., frenzied rituals and dances. According to Saxo Grammaticus they also drank bear or wolf blood.  Berserk rage ? called berserkerganga ? could also happen in a middle of daily work. It began with shivering, chattering of the teeth, and a chill in the body. The face swelled and changed its color. Next came great rage, howling, and indiscriminate brawling. When the rage quelled, the berserker was exhausted and dull of mind for up to several days. According to sagas, many enemies of berserkers exploited this stage to get rid of them.  U.S. professor Jesse L. Byock claims (in Scientific American, 1995) that berserker rage could have been a symptom of Paget's disease. Uncontrolled skull bone growth could have caused painful pressure in the head. He mentions the unattractive and large head of Egill Skallagrimsson in Egilssaga. Other possibilities are mild epilepsy and hysteria.  Today the word "berserker" applies to anyone who fights with reckless abandon and disregard to even his own life ? i.e., "goes berserk".

      BERSERKERS	    Legend tells of a cult that took things that little bit further when it came to violent confrontations.	 A band of extreme kamikaze style fighters called the Berserkers. The Berserker would go into battle certainly bare-chested. They required no armour. They felt themselves completely impervious to weapons. They did quite literally so far as we know, go berserk as they went into battle.  But in modern times, the Berserker legend has taken on a whole new twist, and includes speculation that Berserker battle frenzy was fuelled by a form of drug, widely found in Scandinavia - narcotic mushrooms.

       	   VICTIMS OF SUCCESS	    At the start of the ninth century, the Vikings terrorised Western Europe looting monasteries and settlements. The Vikings became conquerors, settlers, builders of great fortresses and cities. They grew rich on the proceeds of manufacture and international trade. Their navigational skills pushed them to the very edge of the world. So how did this evolution occur?  	 As the Viking sphere of influence grew, so did the ambition of Viking chieftains. They wanted absolute power as well as wealth, but this wasn't always a popular aspiration. Groups of Viking settlers began leaving Scandinavia for the empty lands of Iceland and Greenland. We explore the building of large and sturdy cargo ships, the ingenuity of Viking survival clothing and the mysteries of navigation in an age before magnetic compasses. Finally, their naval skills enabled the Vikings to reach the end of the world… America.   The documentary follows one archaeologist to Nova Scotia on his quest to identify the landscapes of Vinland described in the Viking sagas. His journey also reveals the weaknesses behind the Viking expansion, as we ask: why did the Vikings disappear from history?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Genius of the Vikings Sunday 8th & 15th February  10pm UK      In 865 AD, a 'great army' of Viking ships invaded England. The Viking capital was Jorvik- the modern city of York. Manufacturing, building, town planning- the Vikings of York were settlers and conquerors.   By the mid-ninth century their trading journeys had taken them through Russia and even as far as Constantinople. We visit Gotland, a small island in the Baltic Sea, to explore the enormous wealth in Viking silver that lies mysteriously buried there.

      RAIDERS BY DESIGN	    In the eighth century AD, the Vikings took the world by storm.  In the three hundred years that followed, their armies conquered large parts of Europe; their merchants blazed a trail through Russia to the Middle East; and their ships sailed to the very ends of the Earth: to a place we now call America. 	 This documentary also delves deeper into the way the Vikings fought and their weapons. Warriors were armoured with swords, axes, shields and mail coats. But just how effective were these? Investigation of their sword-making shows a complex process that produced weapons of great style but not always top quality.   Viking men lived and fought together, feasted together, worshipped pagan gods together. Was it this unity that made them such a devastating force? Was Viking pagan belief in war and heroic death, combined with their cutting edge naval technology, the true secret of their success?   Within fifty short years, Viking bands conquered most of England and were poised to take on the world's wealthiest empire: Byzantium.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Genius of the Vikings Sunday 8th & 15th February  10pm UK    The Vikings first burst on the scene in 793 AD with a savage hit-and-run raid on the coastal monastery of Lindisfarne in northern England, one of many to come. Their brutality had become legend, but did the Viking achievement rest on more than just violence?   The secret of Viking success at raiding came from speed and surprise. And this came from their long, sleek sailing ships.   Modern tests reveal that their speed and manoeuvrability came from the Vikings' superb understanding of ship design and technology. The long ship was truly a secret weapon.

      Berserkers, so prominent in Hrolf's Saga, are the remnants in Christian times of older stories. In pre-Christian Scandinavia, berserkers seem to have been members of cults connected with Odin in his capacity as god of warriors. Snorri Sturluson in Ynglinga Saga, recalling numerous elements of ancient lore, describes Odin's warriors in this way:    His men went to battle without armor and acted like mad dogs or wolves. They bit into their shields and were as strong as bears or bulls. They killed men, but neither fire nor iron harmed them. This madness is called berserker-fury.  The berserkers of the saga, who often appear as the core of the king's warband, are at times reminiscent of the retinue of warriors surrounding Odin and may ultimately derive from ancient bear cults. Debate has centered on the meaning of the word itself. Berserker could mean "bare shirt," that is, naked; berserkers, as a mark of ferocity and invincibility, are said to have fought without needing armor. The word, however, may also mean "bear-shirt," reflective of the shape and nature of the bear assumed by these warriors. More literally, it may refer to protective bearskins that such warriors may have worn into battle. When the "berserker rage" was upon him, a berserker was thought of as a sort of "were-bear" (or werewolf), part man, part beast, who was neither fully human nor fully animal. Although not specifically so called, Bodvar Bjarki is a berserker of sorts. He appears at Hrolf's final battle in the form of a huge bear, invulnerable to weapons. In both his invulnerability and his ability to change shape, Bodvar also displays preternatural abilities resembling those of Odinic champions.

      my fave character, since i identify with him so much.  Over the years Wolverine has learn to control his beserker rages to some degree.       When in a beserker rage, he does not hold back (fights to kill) or roll with punches.  Wolverine will recover from his beserker rage when there is no one left to kill. Or he is confronted by someone he considers a friend (recommended only for the very brave or foolhardy). Or if he uses his intelligence! (ahem) Heightened Senses Enhanced Hearing Enhanced Smell Track by Scent Heightened Endurance, agility, charisma  sounds like the "be philosophical about it" advise, which does work for me anyway. :P sometimes.

      While the bulk of a Celtic army would typically consist of poorly armored spearmen, it was the warrior nobles who wielded swords that were the most feared. These Gallic Swordsmen were wealthier than their peers, and could afford to equip themselves not only with their slashing and stabbing sword, but also with a helmet and shield. They often charged into battle bare-chested or completely naked, occasionally wearing vividly patterned pants or cloaks. Similar to the Viking Berserker, they began their battles by viciously taunting their enemies, and followed it with a mad rush against enemy lines. This was standard behavior for skirmishes between clans, which were frequent in Celtic society. These tribal conflicts provided starting points for young Celts who sought to openly display their bravery and skill as a warrior. Celtic warriors were also known to serve as mercenaries to numerous armies of the classical period. The best known of instance of this, is when Celtic mercenaries joined Hannibal in his invasion of Italy during the 2nd Punic War, contributing to victories against Rome.

      "Modern scholars believe that certain examples of berserker rage to have been induced coluntarily by the consumption of drugs such as the hallucinogenic mushroom *Amanita muscaria* (Howard D. Fabing. "On Going Berserk: A Neurochemical Inquiry." Scientific Monthly. 83 [Nov. 1956] p. 232), or massive quantities of alcohol (Robert Wernick. The Vikings. Alexandria VA: Time-Life Books. 1979. p. 285). While such practices would fit in with ritual usages, other explanations for the berserker's madness have been put forward, including self-induced hysteria, epilepsy, mental illness or genetic flaws (Peter G. Foote and David m. Wilson. the Viking Achievement. London: Sidgewick & Jackson. 1970. p. 285). "  in modern times, in a social situation/polite society, the cities now huge, and suburbs sprawling..it may be considered a "genetic flaw" or "handicap" or "disability". but surely it was considered a beneficial trait to have? or 'sacred/divine' ability. being a great fighter would be a benefit, and could be used beneficially..and that's still been a theme in modern times. the superman. the great fighting machine. superhero. attempts have been made recently along these lines. obvious one is the nazis. but how about the USA?  icons of usa: Arnold and Sylvester as unstoppable fighting machines. either as heroes.  or, as a horrific unstoppable villain.  how about the villains of hollywood? unstoppable. you keep shooting at them and they don't die. you think they're died and they jump up and attack you again. eg. Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street.   even now it's of some benefit.  but not so much if you are a woman. female berserkers now, get put in hospitals, asylums, and are medicated to stop them being aggressive.  is it not natural to be aggressive, protective, over your children? your home/nest? an angry woman is looked down upon, and ppl do their best to shut them up. and say they are crazy.

      T IN THE PARK: PARK NAKED  Jul 12 2004  Camp pop singer does a a strip for music festival fans  By John Dingwall   SCISSOR Sisters singer Jake Shears gave 60,000 fans a tease in the park yesterday. The flamboyant frontman stripped off his tartan toga to flash at the crowd.  The New York band, who have had hits with Take Your Mama Out and Laura, were one of the first acts on the main stage at Balado yesterday afternoon.  And Shears left fans with something to remember after revealing his little snippet.  Kirsty Reid, 18, of Bishopton, Renfrewshire, said: 'He pulled off his tartan toga and stood there naked bowing to the crowd.  'He said he was going to be a true Scotsman and took his pants off too.'  Camp Shears was left in just a pair of cowboy boots, as band-mate Anna Matronic looked on.  Shears wasn't the only performer to flash the flesh yesterday.  Singer Alison Goldfrapp lifted the kilt of her keyboard player Will Gregory at the end of their hit Strict Machine - revealing a peace symbol on his bare bottom.  She had already shocked the crowd by pretending to perform a sex act with her radio mic.  And Saturday headliners The Darkness saw their stage hijacked by a pot-bellied streaker.  The ginger-haired man took to the stage as singer Justin Hawkins left for a costume change.  Scots bassist Frankie Poullain looked stunned as the streaker stayed on stage for several minutes before wandering off.  The incident was an embarrassing security breach for the festival organisers, who later claimed they were unaware of the incident.  A spokeswoman said: 'I didn't see anything like this and I have heard nothing of it.  'I'm sure it wasn't staged because that would have been incredibly hard to organise. We will be looking into it.'  The streaker wasn't the only surprise guest during The Darkness's set. Eleven young Scots pipers and two drummers joined them on stage.  The lads - mainly students at Glasgow's Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama - adapted the Darkness song Love On The Rocks With No lce for the bagpipes Stuart Cassells, 25, of Falkirk, revealed they had been invited to tea with the band at their hotel.  He said: 'We were approached by The Darkness guitarist Dan Hawkins at the last minute. We were told to keep it secret so that it could be a big surprise for the audience.  'We met them at their hotel in the afternoon before their gig and had high tea with them.  'Justin was doing party tricks for our benefit, throwing cigarettes into his mouth and larking about. They're great guys.  'We joked that we wanted £5000 per person but he haggled us down to a fiver plus expenses. We should have got in there before he spent all his money on that catsuit.'  Around 120,000 people watched more than 120 acts on eight stages over the two-day event, including Saturday sets by Muse, Starsailor, Black Eyed Peas and Wu Tang Clan.  Scots favourites Franz Ferdinand and Snow Patrol, trip hop greats Massive Attack and The Pixies were among the most talked about acts to fire up the final day's proceedings.  Medics treated more than 100 fewer people than last year.  They reported 346 injuries yesterday - mostly for sprains, strains, cuts and bruises. Thirty people needed hospital treatment.  There were 42 arrests, 22 of them drug-related.  Event commander Chief Superintendent Matt Hamilton, of Tayside Police, said: 'Overall, we are happy with everything on site.'  Festival stars collected customised goody bags after their performances.  Pink was given a pair of specially commissioned handmade sheepskin boots from Australia.  The Scissor Sisters were presented with boots bearing their logo on one heel and their initials or name on the other.  Stars also received Hamilton & Inches jewellery, handmade to a design by Nathalie Ambro.  Pringle of Scotland gifted Sport Tote bags and handbags, along with luxury Zirh face cream.

         The Darkness - More live dates planned in 2004 The Darkness Extras      JUSTIN TIME FOR XMAS!   THE DARKNESS plan to tour the UK at the end of the year.  Following their headline slot at the Carling Weekend: Reading And Leeds Festivals, the band have lined up an 18-date UK arena tour for November and December, according to Music Week.  The dates will be fans last chance to see the band before they record their second album in early 2005.  Speaking about the band’s success, Justin Hawkins said the group’s forthcoming appearances at the Carling Weekend: Reading And Leeds festivals will be a highlight.  He said: "It was always my dream to play at Reading, let alone headline it. I’m not sure if there has been a band that has headlined Reading, T In The Park and the Irish festival Oxegen in the same year, let alone a band doing it on their first album.  "The arena tour in November will also be amazing. I’m looking forward to the end of that which will finish with three dates at Wembley, although I’m not sure If that is all confirmed yet."  Meanwhile, the band are set to re-record 'Get Your Hands Off My Woman' for an American single with Foreigner and Cheap Trick producer Roy Thomas Baker.  Plus, they plan to release a Christmas DVD - said to include the band's 'first feature film' alongside an on-the-road documentary and collected videos.  source nme  glad i didn't go to the festivals. thank you to me for having patience for once, and waiting, thinking they'd probably do more shows, and not fest ones.

      "In the light of what we now know, it seems Iraq possessed no significant stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons. Saddam had no active major programmes or tangible plans to regenerate his chemical warfare programme, therefore there could be no meaningful command and control arrangements or plans to use them. The same is probably true of biological weapons but the nature of BW systems is such that significant capabilities are more easily concealed."  from indie again today from me: USA deal with this by making the CIA the fall guys.  and the UK? who's going down here?  "George Tenet, the outgoing director of the CIA, said last month that intelligence estimates were rarely all right, or all wrong."  it would have been hoped he'd have said and meant it, that CIA estimates are usually correct. so really because it's estimates, we can make up whatever the hell we want to. ooo we're so clever, and it looks scientific too.  all in quotation is from Dr Brian Jones is a former head of the nuclear, chemical and biological branch of the Ministry of Defence's Defence Intelligence Staff  in the independent

      Exposed: the rampant sexism that defines the world of Formula One  By Beverley Turner, who worked as a trackside TV reporter for three years  08 July 2004   Nestled in the wooded area between the Gold and Silver entrances to the Hungarian Grand Prix were 20 whitewashed booths beneath a banner proclaiming "Erotik Camping". Each contained a red carpet, a grey-blanketed bed and a neat stack of toilet rolls. Formula One had come to town, and an open-air brothel had been specially erected for the occasion.  F1 was perceived as a prime market for prostitution. It is hard to imagine any other sport engendering such an obvious association, but then no other sport has such an outdated relationship to women.  During my three seasons as an F1 TV reporter, I witnessed the world of elite motor racing defining itself as "cutting edge", but promoting ideologies from the Dark Ages.  The driver Eddie Irvine turned his charms on me at the Brazilian Grand Prix when the conversation turned to a mutual friend, a German F1 presenter whose contract had been unexpectedly cancelled.  "Oh that's a shame," he said from behind mirrored sunglasses. "It was good watching her arse walk down the paddock."  I assumed he was being sarcastic. "Hmm..." I said. "I'll miss her conversation too."  "No, I won't miss that," he said, quite seriously. "She just looked good - she was just here to be looked at. That's all any of you are here for, just to be looked at."  There were eight other men sitting listening. Nobody said a word, except for Niki Lauda. He looked at me from beneath his baseball cap and shrugged. "It's a man's world," he said.  In F1 "men do" and "women adorn". Being attractive is a prerequisite to gaining acceptance and the yardstick by which all women are judged.  While filming an item about "Women behind the scenes in Formula One", I was unnerved by the disparity between what the interviewees would say on camera and what they confessed to me afterwards.  "There is so much sexism," said one woman who eventually left her job in PR, "but it's very subtle. It's not just about leggy blondes everywhere: it's much more hidden than that."  One female IT engineer claimed - on and off camera - that her gender had never caused her any problems. But afterwards I chatted to one of her male colleagues, saying that it was great to show a woman working in the technological field. "Yeah," he agreed, "But just think what we could do with her if she wasn't such a dog."  F1 stands alone in its use of women to promote the sport. No dedicated website is complete without an invitation to vote for your favourite "Pit Babe". Of course, some American sports still have cheerleaders, but at least these girls actually do something. F1 sits its models on car bonnets and drapes them over drivers.  The marketing concept of the "Fosters Girls" was invented for F1. This troop of young women appears at Grands Prix wearing blue micro-minis and cropped Lycra tops. They are led around the circuit in a line, stopping from time to time to have their picture taken.  On one memorable occasion they walked between tables at the Silverstone Ball, looking miserable as several male guests attempted to grope their bottoms. I turned to my dinner companion and said: "I can't believe a global sport still has women like this on display."  "I know," he said, "they're pigs. You'd think they could find some attractive ones."  Such attitudes are so endemic in F1 that it is difficult for women to be taken seriously in any capacity. Increasing numbers are employed in motor racing but their roles are largely confined to PR, catering and sponsor liaison.  Last season, F1 Racing magazine ran a feature on the "Fifty most powerful people in Formula One", and not one was a woman, after 50 years of the sport.  Women have, however, been involved in motor racing from its inception. The romantic novelist Barbara Cartland was the force behind some of the earliest female drivers at the Brooklands track in the 1920s. Five women competed in F1 between 1958 and the early Nineties but they all drove incomparably bad cars.  Bernie Ecclestone explains why we may never see another: "No one will take them seriously or sponsor them financially, therefore they're never ever going to get into a competitive car."  In sport, the perception exists that any event in which men and women can compete equally cannot be very hard.  F1's manufactured image is based on testosterone, aggression and the fighting instincts of the modern-day gladiators, the drivers. Put a woman alongside Michael Schumacher in the grid and that veneer of machismo would slip.  Experts in physiology and psychology now widely accept that the strengths needed to drive an F1 car are certainly attainable by women.  Michael Schumacher admits that physical difference is not the issue. "The reasons are cultural," he said recently. "There are too few women coming up the ranks." To a certain extent he is right, but that argument is becoming an easy excuse. There is a specific challenge that only female drivers must overcome. I once asked an influential character at McLaren-Mercedes whether a female F1 driver was a likely scenario.  "Ach, ja!" came the enthusiastic response. "Sure, they are very good, very talented. The problem is" - he paused, searching for the right phrase - "they are just not very pretty. They look like men, really."  I tried to explain that the male drivers were hardly Armani models but he replied: "It is different. Women must be more beautiful, more feminine. That's how it is."  This pressure is evidenced by the homepages set up by female drivers. Moodily lit shots play up their attractiveness and detail hobbies such as "renovating my home". The website of the American driver Sarah Fisher (who became the youngest person - not just woman - to qualify for the Indy Racing League) reveals that she is "superstitious about painting her toenails before a race weekend".  The male team principals demand that female drivers not be "like men" and the women have no choice but to oblige. But it is hard to imagine Michael Schumacher respecting a competitor who publicly admits to being superstitious about varnishing her toenails.  The Budapest brothel lasted just one season after complaints - not from F1, but from the local Catholic community. The taboo of the female F1 driver has proved harder to overturn.  A woman in a competitive car would revolutionise F1's image, re-energise the competition and attract a new fan base. Her team would be front-page news as the most forward-looking brand on the grid.  In a sport driven by global marketing ambitions, it is extraordinary that nobody has yet seized this potential. Ecclestone described his ideal female racing driver as "Perhaps a black girl, with super looks, preferably Jewish or Muslim, who speaks Spanish".  It was a joke, I think, but a revealing one. In Formula One, sexism even defeats the forces of capitalism.  from indie   from me..what's beverley doing there then? she decided to be a sports writer i woud think, and has somehow bagged the motor racing formula one spot. like people aren't fighting each other tooth and nails for that one.

      "Baby boomers defiantly refuse to grow old  By Maxine Frith, Social Affairs Correspondent  12 July 2004   The baby boom generation is refusing to grow old gracefully, preferring instead to recapture its youth with lavish spending on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, rock albums and round-the-world travel, a report published today says.   Research by the Demos think-tank has found that people in their forties and fifties are becoming a more profitable market than their teenage children because they have more money and a greater desire for luxury goods.   The report,Eternal Youths, found that the generation born between 1945 and 1965 is obsessed with staying young ˇ in looks and spirit. Rather than saving for old age, they are "spending their kids' inheritance" and are more likely to have Botox than play bowls.   The Demos study concludes: "As a generation, the baby boomers are likely to reject many of the traditional associations of old age. In making personal fulfilment their priority, many will use their purchasing power, connections and self-awareness to dominate the images and rituals of popular culture, the research shows.   "From middle-aged men and women on motorbikes to new beauty products and treatments and music retailing, the dominance of baby boomers will only grow," the report adds.   The research found that the average age of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle owner has increased from 38 to 46 over the past decade. The model train maker Hornby says that 75 per of its sales are now to adults rather than children, and the fortysomething age group buys more albums than teenagers.   The share of the market bought by teenagers has fallen from 22.1 per cent to 16.4 per cent over the past two years, while the 40-to-49 age group's slice has increased from 16.5 per cent to 19.1 per cent in the same period.   The report says Tony Blair is a typical member of the baby boom generation. He has confessed to a love of playing his electric guitar, and last year said he was a fan of the Darkness after raiding his children's CD collections.   People over 45 are now responsible for nearly 80 per cent of the country's wealth and one third of all consumer spending.   The Demos report says that companies which have previously aimed their marketing at the youth market, such as Adidas and Sony, should instead focus on the well-heeled "middle agers" who want to spend money they never had as teenagers.   The report's author, James Harkin, says: "Baby boomers seem intent on having their time again. For some, this may mean being able to finally afford the cool brands of their youth that they never had the money to buy when they were young."   He warns, however, that these born-again, middle-aged teenagers are becoming so obsessed with recapturing their youth that they are reluctant to accept that they are growing old.   "The blind spot of baby boomers is their refusal to come to terms with the natural processes of growing old. It is a paradox of our ageing society that many of us seem increasingly obsessed with the idea of youth ... Rather than regressing into youth, our ageing society could reclaim some of the benefits of growing older: wisdom, finesse and accumulated experience," Mr Harkin suggests. "   where does that leave me? i was born in 1966. my parents were born between 1945 and 1949. they're baby boomers, and i missed it by a year. 1966. the year of sgt. pepper's lonely heart club band. and dare i forget this. English Football. which i didn't even see at the time. i was born in october... i can't afford a bike, or all that stuff, and i went to university in the late 80's. so that's why i'm OUT of the ballpark i guess.

The Darkness took offense after hearing that Keane said that their reign on the British charts was coming to a close at the Scottish T at the Park festival this weekend. Bassist Frankie Poullain was so enraged, in fact, that he said Keane were "sheet soilers" who played music to which you "suck your thumb."     the stuff the Darkness come out with though, it does make me laugh, and hey Keane started it! :P

      i just went and looked at the list of  'recently updated' blogs, and they were quite a few porn ones, and i spotted while rapidly scrolling down the list..it was long...2 teen porn blogs. there may be more. i just noticed those while scrolling down to see if any other uk blogs. or mac ones. or art. or something... saw an idiot one, several ones along the lines of being insane and schizophrenic. not something to laugh at. so i hope it isn't poking fun.  er. it's okay of course to be light sometimes if you have an illness, or even a lot of the time. helps me.   i think one of the worst things to do is put a label on your condition. look how many syndromes there are these days. that seems to mean next to nothing really. you've got a cluster of symptoms that are akin to this particular thing we think. but since those symptoms occur with other syndromes, diseases, etc, we can't be sure.  etc etc...  still have to say thanks to those in the medical field that have helped me. and others.

      "T in the Park probe launched   The Darkness are one of this year's headline acts   Police have launched an investigation into an internet tickets scam at Scotland's T in the Park festival.   Internet auction site eBay said it had received complaints from customers who bought tickets from a Glasgow address for the event at Balado near Kinross.   Strathclyde Police said it was aware of the incidents and enquiries were at an early stage.   The organisers of the event sold all 120,000 tickets 10 weeks ago for the two-day event which begins on Saturday.   Missing tickets   More than 120 artists are set to perform across the festival's eight stages.   Rock legend David Bowie has cancelled due to ill health but spandex-clad Brit Award winners The Darkness and US rock band The Strokes will headline over the festival's two days.   Other top acts include Franz Ferdinand, Black Eyed Peas, The Pixies, Beta Band and The Scissor Sisters.   Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins has had a £20,000 catsuit custom-made for his performance on Saturday.   The group were said to be "jumping for joy" when they heard that Bowie had been forced to pull out.   The band said that they were desperate to headline the event.    David Bowie was forced to pull out of T in the Park    Guitarist Dan Hawkins said: "My ambitious side was a bit disappointed when we heard we were second fiddle to David Bowie.   He added: "But when I heard he had pulled out I was jumping for joy. I'm sure T in the Park organisers were glad we were there. Not many could step up to do it."   Bassist Frankie Poullain said: "Thank God we never pulled out or Starsailor would be headlining."   Bowie was forced to cancel his headlining performance due to a pinched nerve.   However, the singer was then diagnosed with an acutely blocked artery which required emergency surgery.   Negative feedback   According to newspaper reports, whoever sold the non-existent tickets may have fleeced music fans of £8,000.   James Squires, 25, from Leeds, bid £312 last week for a pair of tickets for himself and wife Carolina but his tickets never arrived.   He said: "The guy said he would send the tickets once the cheque cleared and when we saw it had been cashed we hoped the tickets would arrive on Wednesday or Thursday.   "But when we saw the negative feedback about the seller on eBay and couldn't get in touch with him we realised the worst."   There are rumoured to have been at least 25 other victims who paid between £250 and £340 for similar tickets.    We were informed of this and suspended the account of the seller immediately and also contacted the police.     eBay UK spokeswoman    eBay UK said it was "desperately sorry" to hear its users had been defrauded and pledged to do everything it could to help track down the culprit.   A spokeswoman said 0.01% of transactions end up with bidders being duped.   The company has recently launched a buyers' protection programme through the web-based payment system PayPal, insuring customers for damages up to £250.   She said: "We were informed of this and suspended the account of the seller immediately and also contacted the police."   A police spokesman said: "We have been made aware of the incident and we're currently investigating. Enquiries are at an early stage."   A media spokeswoman for T in the Park refused to comment and a spokeswoman for promoters DF Concerts said people should only buy tickets from officials sources."   what counts as being duped?  i think that it's a bit more than 0.01% being duped on ebay.  then again i've sold stuff on ebay, and i haven't duped anyone.  but i noticed people with loads of feedback, well the positive feedback looked faked.  look at the seller's negative feedback before you buy.  and see what the seller's reply was.  i've seen seller's write really defensive, even nasty replies: eg. "i never said it was in good condition.they should have complained before."  then there's the ppl who are competitors who may write a negative reply, or even pranksters, oh too funny.  but it shows that system could use a few changes.

      German police revive rabbit   BERLIN (Reuters) - German police have successfully resuscitated a dwarf rabbit named Napoleon by breathing through a ball point pen after he passed out in a house fire, authorities say.   Two officers were called to a Berlin flat where firefighters had dragged the unconscious rabbit's cage outside. The officers opened Napoleon's mouth with a pen and breathed down it while giving the pet a cardio massage, a police spokesman said on Saturday.   The officers then rushed Napoleon by police car to a vet, who will keep him for observation for a few days.   reuters as usual.

      you know those dollz that you can make online by dragging bits and pieces of them together? well this is like that, except it's jesus on the cross, and you can dress him up. also if you want, you can print it out, and make you own stand up dress up jesus. sort of sick. so if you get upset by spoofs of jesus, then this is not for you. but look hey there's no blood or anything like on those pictures and statues in churches and cathedrals, and religious knick-knacks. so it may be less upsetting.

      if This Is True, Then Why Aren't Cats Extinct? I found this picture on my hd, don't know where I downloaded them. The caption on godkills.jpg is "Everytime you masturbate... God kills a kitten. Please, think of the kittens." The pictures shows a kitten running away from some things that look like brown lunch bags with teeth painted on them."

      King Arthur' puts Wales on the map  Jul 19 2004  Jenny Rees, The Western Mail    THE success of the film King Arthur could be used to place Wales on the tourist map.  Fans of Welsh heart-throb Ioan Gruffudd will already be hoping that the epic secures his position within Hollywood circles, but the film could also do great things for Welsh tourism.  The film has already hit the box offices in America and opens in the UK on July 30, and it is hoped that as audiences rediscover the roots of one of Britain's most enduring legends, they will also start booking their tickets to visit the very places linked to the tale.  VisitBritain, which markets Britain to the rest of the world, has joined forces with Touchstone Pictures and Buena Vista International to publish a "King Arthur Movie Map".  The unique guide features key destinations and attractions synonymous with Arthurian legend from the Dark to Medieval Ages, as well as Roman Britain's historical sites and locations - and Caerleon in Gwent is one of the areas visitors are urged to visit.  There are 25 Arthurian and Roman locations on the map including Tintagel Castle, Merlin's Grave and Hadrian's Wall, along where much of the film's action and story is played out.  On the reverse of the map, VisitBritain has identified locations that appear in more than 50 new movies, classic film favourites and TV shows from the '60s to the present day.  The new adaptation of the King Arthur legend is being heralded as the most realistic version of the historical facts behind the myth and the map aims to help position Britain as the definitive destination for British and international visitors interested in the ancient legend.  Starring an all-star British cast including Clive Owen, Keira Knightley, Ray Winstone and directed by Antoine Fuqua with Gladiator screenwriter David Franzoni also on board, the film had it's UK premiere last week.  It sets the record straight historically, by going back to the 5th century - the Roman Britain of the Dark Ages. Stripped of the elaborate magic and romance of the medieval stories, King Arthur presents a new but authentic image of Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table - with Gruffudd as Lancelot.  Printed in five languages for international visitors, a map featuring locations throughout the whole of Britain is available by contacting VisitBritain's international call centres or online at www.visitbritain.com/moviemap.     	from icwales  not about the movie, oh no, it's about getting tourists to wales. well hey is that what the movie is all about anyway? put a load of different brit accents in there, stick in a real welsh person, but in the stupidest move of them all have him play a Sarmation, which I am told is a Russian. yes, i know the references to them in the literature, i mean people keep telling me about it. and i'm familiar with arthurian literature, the history arguments, etc. why make Ioan Russian? I mean use his Welshness, his Britishness and make him be Welsh in it maybe? O.o and what's with the east london geezer as bors? so knightly isn't he? did they have all those london geezer affectations in the dark ages? i suspect not. no i haven't seen the film. but i mean show us most of it why don't you in the promos? and the casting? eeek! mind boggling.  (too lazy and tired to use capitals, and that doesn't make ppl illiterate for abbreviating, and using quick and easy to type lingo on the net. it makes them smart. because they can get more said. and do other things as well. instead of acting as if they are still at school and all they write will be marked and graded by a teacher. i'm long out of school, and university, so i'm long past all those concerns, but i am fed up with seeing ppl being criticised on message boards and forums for using abbreviations, and for not using capitals, or enough commas. stupid argument. petty picking on ppl.stick to the point of the argument, rather than using below the belt put downs.)

      my first blog on here was mac whatever for mac stuff, and i put loads of news about mac stuff on there, i mean i use a mac all the time, and get tons of news and updates sent to me via email, plus i was on dotmac too, and in a couple of mac yahoo groups. but i had a change of heart. i deleted the entire blog. why? i realised i was advertising apple products by doing this. and there are plenty of websites with apple news, apple stuff for sale now. so why repeat it?  at first i thought, i would put it on a blog so it would be info for me to check back to. eg all the mac websites i visit. news that i saw that seemed important. but now i haven't been going on those sites, nor am i reading the apple emails i get. nor am i trying out new applications. or going on mac.com even though i have a subscription.  so why bother with a mac blog with news on if i don't really care about most of it, and it's irrelevant to me. it all got deleted.  then after i did that, my friend said to me, omg where's your mac whatever blog?  i though no one else read it.  i said i had deleted it due to lack of interest. lack of interest on my part that is to just repeat what i got in emails. which are mostly ads let's face it.  so are the online mag articles, really it sums up to free advertising. next i'll get a t-shirt with apple on you know. buy a t-shirt and walk around adverstising the product. look i should get paid for wearing a company's logo, it makes me and anyone else who does it a walking billboard. and i paid to be a billboard? nuts isn't it?  but my pal said that was a good name..mac whatever, put it back. so i did, and i try to put just opinions or rants i suppose on there, okay there's some dumb info, and a little news, but i can't promote something like that. i mean especially when i am so angry that so many things are mac incompatible.  and my mac has been much better without all that updating and mucking around.  happy mac now.

O.o couldn't find them there before. but this time i did. they must have been hiding from me,  naughty little emoticons.  went to sign into my website, but keep getting a javascript error. not of my doing. must be the webhost, and it was doing that sunday as well.  so much for my plans to add the smilies. back typing stuff on here because i'm irritated with that. computer rage. or would that be called internet rage? webhost rage?  to hell with it, i'll watch the rest of Spaceballs on tv.

      i may change my blog title..never could think of a really good one, anyway, cos well, i blab on about anything and everything, and i could i suppose call it "chatterbox", or "lisa's on her soapbox again", ooops, i did think of a few good ones, but indecision is my wall. so i put in the simplest dumbest stupidest title around, as in state the obvious. it's a blog. a uk one. and i put whatever i want on it.  it did have wierd and whatever in the title at one point, but well..that wasn't simple enough.  i did have a radio show called, thanks to me and my pal george, "The Ever Hyperbolic Experiment" now that wasn't so simple was it? and it was well mostly my idea, cos i saw the word used to describe the UK press in a USA music magazine,  yeah i recall it know..i can see it in my mind...it was an article about Jesus and Mary Chain.  and our show was too hip for Spielberg..i always spell his name incorrectly at first.. i before e no e before i..wait..er...speile..no speile..nope spiele..there's something about it being like a german word or a yiddish, well in the NYC area anyway..like spiele is bullshit, you know like telling porkies, don't give me that spiele..tale...  sorry folks if i spelled it incorrectly. ignorance you see.  where's Mel Brooks when you need him?

      RIGHT ON! one says "Too Hip For Spielberg!" yes!!!  i thought i was the only one..er..that isn't too keen on that dude. i know i put the pics of guenivere from the King Arthur movie on this blog, but hey, i was interested to see what those ppl would do with those characters. not as if the story hasn't been told ad nauseum lately is it? so what's going to be different in this version?  :sigh: when i heard way back that he had his mitts on King Arthur, I was outraged. leave the boy King alone rich hollywood dude. oh i forgot, that's one of your tired and true bits you do, the little kid thing. the too smart for words kid, the golden child... the boy king should have guessed he'd grab that as his own too.

      now that would be excellent.  but please don't let barbie/mattel barbie barbie bimbo make it. oh no! i'll be hunted down at shot for speaking out against barbie!  no no no..Sindy was way more hip. a Sindy Tank Girl.  well even then i am not so sure.  i had Action Girl when i was a girl, and what happened to her? she was great! and a Tank Girl Action Girl would be super duperiffic!  no i didn't have a Sindy or a Barbie.  i did have a giant Tressie doll. turn the nob on her back and her hair goes longer and shorter. there was a Sindy size one too, my sis had. but the big one had those proper doll eyes, with lids that close. instead of painted on ones.  and she came in a glitter jumpsuit too. Justin Hawkins did you have a giant Tressie doll too?

      allergies are terrible today. got worse when let dog in garden, and he ran back in. he'd been digging. he keeps digging in the same hole in the garden.  he brought the post up to the bedroom today, well sort of. he managed to get one to the top of the stairs. one at the bottom of the stairs. and the other half way along the hall towards the stairs.  luckily none ripped up. only corners messed up a bit.  thinking how the heck to stop him doing this. he only just started a few days ago. but he seems to think it's great fun.  he was also discovered two days ago in the garden, when i let him out with what looked suspiciously like a glasses case. but he wouldn't come over to give it up.  anyway, finally grabbed it off him, and it turned out to be david's glasses case. then david found the glasses as well, chewed up in the grass. thankfully they were the reading glasses but we just got them 2 weeks ago and they're prescription glasses. not ones you get off the shelf for reading. so we were furious.  keep going through training stuff with the dog, but how to stop him pinching stuff, even from great heights i don't know how.  and he has his own chews. so he isn't lacking in that department.  also he gets lots of attention otherwise, and  we're home almost all the time.  he may be bored, i suppose, with me stuck in with allergies. but how to sort this one out?  can't have him chewing up thing like that.

      hey no links today.  been active around the house. training my dog, who's just over 1 year old. he woke me up at 6:25am this morning. so i had 5 hours sleep. took him out into the garden...immediately got terrible allergies.  trained him to sit and stay. he's actually staying now when i walk away. amazing! :O  i can't see him sitting when visitors stop by though. a market researcher man stopped by yesterday, and the dog jumped all over him.  well, i did warn the man.  i practiced guitar for about an hour. stretched. getting ready for guitar lesson.  was a pretty relaxed lesson. teacher had brought a different guitar. i really liked the sound of it better. he says he has los because he collects them. not surprising that. but he has some really nice acoustic guitars.  so my new song to learn this week is 'Let It Be!"  got to go make a phone call now.

      Rock and Pop CDs: Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live In Hyde Park (Warner Bros)  Tom Baxter - Feather And Stone (Columbia)  Reviewed by Graeme Virtue    IT must be great being a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan in 2004. Ten years ago, the Los Angeles pranksters were making wiry, freaky punk-funk that could increase your blood sugar and make your sex magic, but all their UK record company was interested in doing was endlessly re-releasing their signature track Under The Bridge in an effort to make it a hit. Boo hoo.  For the last two years, though, there’s been a steady stream of solid RHCP product; their By The Way album and its brood of nagging singles, then a greatest hits (their second), then a DVD and now this: a double live album that clocks in at over two hours, collated from their three sold-out shows at London’s Hyde Park in June this year.   Despite their chaotic career arc – stratospheric highs and grubby, druggy lows – the Chilis have survived to become one of the biggest bands on the planet, almost by accident. No matter how you feel about their deliriously melody-laden recent material, they’ve earned the right to release a live record to mint their moment at the top .  Of course, live albums are usually an indulgence, for both record buyer and band. Here, you get reasonable versions of most of their best songs – from Throw Away Your Television to Can’t Stop, Scar Tissue to Zephyr Song – but without actually being there, the wind occasionally snatching the tune out of your ears, it can all seem a little flat, despite Flea’s heroic bass manipulation and Anthony Keidis’s unwavering vocals.  The most interesting moments are the throwaway ones – the cover of Joy Division’s Transmission that serves as the introduction to Right On Time, a falsetto I Feel Love and a medley of famous drum solos (!). Unfortunately, there’s also a three-minute trumpet workout from Flea, pointlessly filtered through a guitar pedal and a final, final encore of Give It Away that stretches out into a plodding 10-minute jam. Under The Bridge still sounds good, though. Maybe they should release this version as a single.  His record company are obviously hoping that he’ll slot nicely into a lucrative commercial sector somewhere between Keane and Damien Rice, but there’s real substance to Tom Baxter. H is quavering voice sounds like it’s been around the block a few times, and thanks to string-laden musical settings that owe more to Nick Drake than the usual cash-register jazz, there’s a sense of honest craft to the Irishman’s debut album Feather And Stone. There’s an emotional honesty to songs like My Declaration and The Moon And Me that gets under your skin, although it’s an intimacy you’ll be sharing with thousands of others in six months or so, when he’s deservedly massive.   01 August 2004  guess i got lucky being in the states then here for their highs there, and there highs here. interesting though how now they are so popular here, and well-marketed here as well.

      It looks like Lehigh has grown immensely since I was there. And at the same time, I recognise the places around campus in the pictures. And they are still wearing the same kind of clothes. I can't say I did, I stood out sometimes there a lot.  accused of having a NYC style. which looks out of place in that part of Pennsylvania.  oh heck. spell PA. spell Transylvannia..  spell Mississipi  spell Worcester.  Leicester  pronounce the above. :D good test to see who is from USA and who is from UK.

      and i only just realised that my alma mater had their newspaper "The Brown and White" online. the days i spent there at Lehigh University, PA, seems a long long time ago. Since i'm in wales now, it seems even longer ago.  I just get asked about it a lot here in the UK. What was the states like? What was school like there? Why do they call it college, or just school, when it's a University?  (why do i find the term "uni" that's used in the UK pretentious?)  all the little ideas we all have going on about each other, and just from one word used at times.  i was told at a pub i used to go to by other people i saw there regularly that i seemed as if i were a uni student, that i looked like one.  made me look at myself, that one. i mean when you're in your 30's at guys in there 30's that work at the local beer factory tell you that. and these are people you get along with you think. umm. well, it makes you think.  i'm not feeling much like thinking at the moment, but as usual have to express myself.  something good may come out. so down it goes. keeps my mind off pain anyway.  also. college, as called in the usa, i feel so much older now.  what's the thing that makes me look like a uni student? it's funny. i'm still goofy? okay. i am pretty sure i am not that pretentious. but that doesn't equal uni either...  what does?  is there an essence of uni?

      like how i made my heading rhyme? bad bad headache day today. hiding under the covers all day headache. but david pushed me onto the mac this evening. "come on it'll take your mind off the pain..." so i sat staring at the screen. he had some game up.  was thinking about looking for more rhcp stuff. still staring. then thought about how Flea had been in a few films.  then i swear this is true, i said to david, what's on the tv, is there a film on, so i can sit and watch that. or maybe we can, and he looked in guide and said yeah there's a couple of horror films on in a  bit.  turned my big chair around. and on came Psycho. some remake. and the was a scene in it and i went that dude looks like Flea.  then I yelled it is Flea. look it's Flea. i can't believe i was just thinking about that.  damn.   plus, i haven't looked it up yet, so i didn't know what films he'd been in. pretty odd huh?  i don't read the tv guide either. or follow what's on. david does that. he wouldn't recognise or think about Flea. i mean it wouldn't be noticed by him. it didn't say he was in it in the guide anyway.  it was Psycho, on at 11.15pm bbc 1. remake of the hitchcock film. 1998.

      The 31-year-old Carr is also mining his recent experiences for material. Among several entertaining anecdotes he spins in his show are the time at the Mojo music awards when he "inadvertently" called Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers a cunt ("It was a bit awkward presenting them with the lifetime achievement award afterwards") and an episode when making Distraction that saw a lowly production gopher utter "the most offensive phrase in the English language". (He forbids me to repeat it here, but rest assured, this eight-word imperative lives up to its billing.)  from arts telegraph.

      Rain Can't Dampen Red Hot Chili Peppers    Thursday July 29, 2004 8:16 AM   AP Photo MACK101   By CHRISTY LEMIRE   AP Entertainment Writer   BOSTON (AP) - A little rain couldn't dampen the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band completely rocked Wednesday night in a concert sponsored by The Creative Coalition and the Recording Industry Association of America - easily the biggest and best party so far during the Democratic National Convention.   While everyone else in attendance had the upcoming presidential election in mind, the Los Angeles-based band made only a couple of vague political statements.   ``The next four years in this country can be a more peaceful world,'' said bassist Flea, typically shirtless and sinewy on a stage erected outside the upscale Louis Boston clothing store.   ``Do what you gotta do,'' lead singer Anthony Kiedis said at the end of the band's set.   No matter - the Chili Peppers let their music speak for them, and the coat-and-tied crowd responded, despite an intermittent drizzle.   Actor and director Tony Goldwyn, co-president of The Creative Coalition - a political advocacy group made up of members of the entertainment industry - said the Red Hot Chili Peppers were a natural choice for the show ``because they're fantastic, and everybody wants to come see them and we love their music.''   The foursome played mostly new songs - including ``Scar Tissue,'' ``By the Way'' and ``Californication'' - but they finished off the night with their best-known hit from the early '90s, ``Give It Away.''   Guests nibbled on lobster rolls and cotton candy under a giant white tent next to the stage, where tables were swathed in yellow and orange. In the VIP area inside the store, chef Pino Maffeo had whipped up a menu that included fried oysters wrapped in thinly sliced watermelon, Kobe beef and warm ice cream. (Don't ask - it involves a complicated machine that makes the ice cream warm but doesn't melt it entirely.)   Among the celebrities with access to such delicacies were actors Jason Bateman, Alyssa Milano, Richard Schiff, Wendie Malick and Ellyn Burstyn. Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News Channel talk show host whose political views don't exactly jibe with those of the people in town for the convention, also was there.   And Ben Affleck, the Bostonian who's been ubiquitous this week, made a heavily escorted escape after the concert was done.

      "Darkness singer has intimate piercing   14:36 BST, Friday 30th July 2004 -- by Neil Wilkes  Justin Hawkins, lead singer with rock band The Darkness, punished himself for cheating on his girlfriend by having his penis pierced. According to the Sun today, Justin did the dirty on his manager and long-term lover Sue Whitehouse last Christmas. To teach himself a lesson, the 28-year-old decided to put himself through an eye-watering "Prince Albert" operation - so named after Queen Victoria's husband sung the praises of penis piercings. "Whenever I have a down I always put a piercing in to mark it," the singer told the newspaper. "I was miserable when I had my nipple done. And I was even more miserable when I had my c**k done. Me and Sue split up. I didn’t like myself much. I thought, what’s the most painful place to have a piercing? I’ve taken it out now." Justin is now back together with his grilfriend.

Once your Venus ruler leaves gadabout Gemini on the 7th and enters security-conscious Cancer, the concept of home and hearth can exert a far greater influence. But if home is where your heart is, you’ll find a way to get there, no matter how far from your current address.

      got a bit strange and into the macabre here on the web today. i was mostly doing home stuff, and steering clear on my mac. but while i was whiling away some time awaiting my guitar teacher, i meandered around the web looking for art by rob zombie. i did this because i had told a pal of mine about the darkhorse comic the nail that rob zombie is involved with, and my pal said who's he? and hey you lived in the states, we didn't so..of i went...trying to find examples of his art... too lazy too scan in my white zombie cd la sexorcisto...and well..i was really waiting for my lesson to begin... but felt i must answer this call.  rob zombie's site. cool. but i won't be going there on my own at night. not for the faint of heart. then off to find white zombie stuff. then found a pic of rob showing off his tattoos, and la sexorcisto era art. so sent that off to my pal.  beavis and butthead the movie. the peyote trip scene=rob zombie. that's it right there.  now he's gone way into the horror flick scene. my poor little heart.  decided to look up kittens instead.  needed a cute break after all that.

      The Darkness' relive their school days! Washington | July 28, 2004 3:35:39 PM IST   Rock superstars Justin Hawkins, Dan Hawkins and Ed Graham, better known as the rock band "The Darkness," thrilled their young fans when they re-visited their school in order to open a music center there.  According to ratethemusic.com, the singers who shot to fame with their hit album 'Permission to Land', recently visited the Kirkly High School in England, from where they had passed out in the early 90's.   The singers reportedly spent time chatting with the kids and also gave away their old drum kit and guitars.   "It was absolutely wonderful to see our ex-students who have been so successful. I had a fabulous afternoon talking to them. I haven't seen them since they left. We talked about their lives and how things have moved on," said the school's head mistress, Hazel Johnson.

O.o  feck, those darkness guys know the kessingland guy i bet. i mean it's home to them. and it's a cute animal.  it's not like the other crap this write cites, like being in a shite reality BB type show is it? hey, even that's not all bad.  i do feel for the twits who she says "The indignities suffered by celebs to look good on the red carpet go without saying - having your relevant body parts held firmly in place with sticky tape, forehead frozen with Botox, while maintaining a winning smile is no picnic. " lmao. but even more for the write herself who went onstage in a 10ft  beast costume in beauty and the beast. at an arts centre...huh? wait this was written by a woman? wierd.....o.o  speaking for herself alone then really. how self-centered.

      Courtney ordered into rehab Last updated 28 July 2004  Courtney Love's been ordered into drug rehab by a US court.  The ruling comes from one of the four criminal cases against the singer. A judge in LA sentenced her to an 18 month rehab programme and random drug tests.   Courtney has also been ordered not to drink, to stay away from places where drugs and booze are sold and to avoid people who use and deal drugs.   She spoke to a scrum of reporters outside the court and said she was determined to kick her habit:   "Can I stop taking pills? You guys, please. I have to stop drinking. It's fun, it's funny. Well, it's not funny at all, it's profound, it's deep."  "I want to see if I can do it. I think I can do it. Can you do it? Can we all do it?"  from bbc online.  me: hey, i dont know her personally, so this is only going on by her public persona. i dont care for it. she's a dope thats somehow cunningly got her self in the limelight. funny how dopeheads and bimbos can do that so well. she asks the press can we all do it? no love, yeah she is love isnt she, you are the one with the court order, and bet she cant do it. i think she should though. get straight courtney, sober up. you'll feel better then, and maybe you'll make some sense when you speak. poor woman. it's not a pretty place to be.

      Rock stars were back in town - for a day   JONATHAN REDHEAD  28 July 2004 08:15  Justin meets his namesake - the rock singer - at the Suffolk Wildlife Park.    Even rock stars have to run errands for their mums, it seems. And yesterday, Dan Hawkins from glam rock megastars The Darkness proved that the rock 'n' roll lifestyle does not mean he can't help his mum Sandy out at home. The 27-year-old had returned to Lowestoft for a flying visit with brother and lead singer Justin to visit parents Harry and Sandy at the family home in Blackheath Road.  The pair arrived on Sunday for a brief break but jet off again today for more touring. But at about 10.30am yesterday after a lie-in, Dan, wearing an open black shirt, jeans and black cowboy boots, was sent to his local supermarket to buy a few groceries for what looked like a family lunch. He returned about half an hour later from the nearby Morrisons with a bag containing fresh peppers, tomato ketchup and a tin of chopped tomatoes, as well as a not so healthy packet of cigarettes. Staff at the store were surprised to see the star, who was served by a cashier named Jane, as he signed autographs and chatted to shoppers. However, the chore was made easier by his choice of transport - a navy Mercedes Benz CLK 500, which usually costs around £45,000. Outside the family home, Dan revealed that the band go on tour again today and admitted that Justin was still in bed, before going back inside. Last night, the family all went out together to complete the hectic trip home before the boys go off to prepare for the release of their much-anticipated album in autumn.  On Monday, Dan, Justin, drummer Ed Graham and manager Sue Whitehouse were accompanied by Mr and Mrs Hawkins and a TV documentary crew as they opened a £250,000 musical suite at Kirkley High School, which the brothers once attended. After visiting the school, Mrs Hawkins and Justin went to the Suffolk Wildlife Park at Kessingland to meet Justin's namesake, a giraffe. The giraffe was given the name in tribute to the star's "wild" performances on stage. And after initially being sworn to secrecy by The Darkness management team about the trip, park director Martin Goymour said: "It was great to see that Justin was genuinely excited about fulfilling his promise to visit the park and meet his namesake giraffe.  "For once, however, it was not the rock star who was the centre of attention but Harry, the young giraffe's father, who hogged the limelight - and most of the food offered by Justin."  In keeping with his rock star image, Justin sported a pair of skin-tight leather and feathered trousers, silk shirt and, in his own words, a "J R Hartley hat".  from EDP (the EDP loves these boys, and they do write good stuff, unlike most music news places that just repeat the same old thing. all subscribing to the same news service i suppose)   funny because Prince Charles and Camilla are in Norfolk too at Sandringham,and made a public appearance at the flower show today.  the darkness stole the limelight again!    http://www.ylais.com/

      Lowestoft Seafront Air Festival     July 22, 2004  Thousands of people will be lining the Prom at Lowestoft on Thursday and Friday, July 29-30, to watch the exciting flying programme lined up. It's a perfect place to be and provides a panoramic viewing platform. The aeronautical displays can be seen from 1.45pm to 5.30pm (Thursday) and from 12 noon to 12.30pm and from 1.45pm to 5pm (Friday). Blazing a trail through the sky will be the one and only Red Arrows, Falcons from the Royal Jordanian Air Force, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, a Harrier, Jaguar and Hawk from the RAF, the Blue Eagles as well as helicopters and a Catalina flying-boat. And the Utterly Butterly wing walkers will, as usual, amaze with their daredevil and breathtaking acrobats. Activities start from 10am each day and included in the fun is a fun fair, food village, market stalls and at 10pm each night a fabulous firework display will cascade over the sea. For the first time there will be a voluntary seafront entrance donation £1 per adult. Souvenir programme £3 available from East Point Pavilion. Both help with the considerable running costs of the event. As there will be something like 250,000-300,000 people on the seafront for the two days, taking your car into the heart of Lowestoft is not a good idea! All seafront car parks will be closed and – be warned – police will be operating a strict tow-away system for cars parked in the wrong place. *	Extra trains will be running between Norwich and Lowestoft, with some regular services slightly retimed. *	A special bus for passengers travelling between Oulton Broad North/South stations and Lowestoft will operate. *	Bus services will take you to within a short walk of the seafront. *	If you bring your car, then use the usual festival park-and-ride sites (£10 per car) at Dip Farm, Corton (off A12 just north of Lowestoft) and at Pakefield Rifle Range (on A12 just south of Lowestoft). Both car parks will be open between 8.30am and 11.15pm on both days. The first bus will run at 9am and the last return bus at 11pm. The buses from Dip Farm will drop off/pick up outside Godfreys in Suffolk Road, and the buses from Pakefield Rifle Range will pick up/drop off in Rectory Road. *	Festival hotline: 01502 523525.   from EDP

      great simple little flash diagram showing 'why we are warming"  man, i am stuck in this norfolk site. the EDP online. well it's the first time i ever looked at it, being not much into news. er okay i am but only certain stuff. i don't go reading newspapers or watch it on the tele. on the net, if i see something of interest i go there for a bit.  i though it odd they had link to this from the paper. unlike the other news online webs. they have interesting links. and the stuff in the EDP  is written intelligently. rather than in the OMG how scandalous school of journalism. as if they're YELLING at you.  notice how now on the tele how much the announcers on news and other shows YELL at you so loudly. it stresses me out. i turn over.  notice it started more on the children's shows, then it's crossed over to adult reality shows and pseudo docmentaries. as in: OMG! A GHOST! WE HAVE SOME ACTIVITY!!!!  (ghost runs away...)

      King Arthur – a legendary knights’ tale   EMMA OUTTEN  July 24, 2004  For most people, mention of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table conjures up a romantic scene, with men dressed in shining plate armour and women in silk and satin – all set amid the splendour of the medieval castle of Camelot. For most, this imagery is the stuff of legend, and few know that Arthur really existed, that he lived more than 500 years before the first romantic tales of his adventures were written down and that the reality is a far cry from the chivalrous tales of the Round Table. New film King Arthur sets out to put the record straight, by taking us back to the 5th century, to the Dark Ages. As producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl) describes it, King Arthur is the definitive story of the leader and warrior who emerged to lead the Britons against the Saxons. “It is the story of the man who became King Arthur.” There is evidence that Arthur was a Romano-British soldier – the child of a mixed marriage between a Roman and a Briton, and in the movie he is based on Lucius Artorius Castus, a historical figure whose life and deeds are recorded on his tombstone found in Croatia. Writer David Franzoni, who also wrote Gladiator, added: “There's a moment in history we can actually pin down. There is a name and there is a battle. The name was Lucius Artorius Castus and the battle was the Battle of Badon Hill. “This battle changed the face of Britain and created a legend which has survived for generations and has been reinvented many times.” Director Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day, had grown up with the myths and movies of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He admitted to being nervous about taking on the story of King Arthur. “It's a big legend and it means a lot to a lot of people.” But he said: “I wanted the film to be about King Arthur, not about a magical sword. I think these times need real heroes and he was somebody who I believe was a real hero.” In King Arthur, Clive Owen – tipped to play 007 if recent reports are anything to go by – is cast as the hero.  But in this version of the King Arthur story, there is no magic, no shining armour, and no Camelot. “I have always seen this film as ending where the myth begins,” says Owen. There are, however, “seven hunks in leather”, according to Keira Knightley, who plays Guinevere in the film.  Unfortunately for her male admirers in the audience, Knightley did not attend the King Arthur press conference held at the Park Lane Hotel in London, although she did manage to get to the London premiere of the £90m Hollywood blockbuster later that day. For the ladies in the house, however, there was Clive Owen, 'Sexy Beast' Ray Winstone, and handsome Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd, 'Horatio Hornblower' himself. It wasn't exactly a round table they sat at for the press conference and they were more like knights in shiny suits than in armour (with the exception of Gruffudd who looked like a naughty schoolboy in white shirt and tie) but three out of seven hunks wasn't bad. There is a 'magnificent seven' quality about the knights in the film, and costume designer Penny Rose has made them, look a bit like “fifth century rock stars”. Owen had just one request for his wardrobe. “I wanted Arthur to wear a pair of black leather trousers.” His wish was duly granted. Gruffudd, who plays Lancelot in the film, admitted that he was ridiculed on the set of King Arthur by co-star Winstone – who plays Bors – when Winstone discovered his daily beauty routine.  Gruffudd took his grooming for the role very seriously, although he encountered his fair share of embarrassing situations.  “I made the very foolish error of deciding to be one of the vainest Lancelots of them all and I decided to curl my eyelashes every morning.  “I was rather unfortunate to be caught out by Ray Winstone one morning and, as you can imagine, the word got round very quickly and I soon became Sir Lashalot!”  Gruffud also confessed that he had trouble growing the beard required for the part of the dashing knight.  “I think it took me about three months to grow that little scraggly one that I had, and being Celtic, it turned out red so I had to get it painted in every day to get that black effect.” Before they started shooting King Arthur, the actors spent time in England learning the skills of horse-riding, as well as the choreography of fighting and the art of using various weapons. This was later followed by a two-week boot camp in Ireland. Owen had to start from square one. Although he had done a bit of riding on films, it had only been for a few days. “No-one actually said to me 'can you ride?' so I kept very quiet about it, and was in denial about it.” But he added: “As soon as I got the part, I started lessons straight away – five days a week for seven weeks. “Arthur is supposed to be a good horseman, so a big part of the acting challenge is how you feel and look and present yourself on horseback. “Seventy per cent of the movie is on horseback and it was important that both I and the guys, the knights, looked like we belonged on those horses.”  Thankfully, Owen became very comfortable wielding a sword in one hand and riding with the other.  It was then on to boot camp and the largest set ever built in Ireland. Joking about whether or not they had all partaken of a couple of Guinnesses while filming in Ireland, Gruffudd conceded that horse-riding had been “one of the best ways to clear the cobwebs from the night before…” He had described going to boot camp as a “boys' own adventure”, where he had learnt the double-sword fighting technique for the character of Lancelot. However, it sounded as though Knightley managed to keep up with the men at boot camp. For seven weeks she trained, learning archery, sword-fighting and boxing. When asked about how she coped in such a male-dominated environment, director Fuqua said: “When she was around it wasn't dominated by males!” Winstone never made it to boot camp because of other commitments. “I didn't have a chance to go to boot camp, thank God, because I'm 47 years of age.” As he said: “People used to die before the age of 47 in those days…”  In King Arthur, both the knights and their commander are descended from the original Sarmatian legionaries based in Britain. The Sarmatians were a tribe of warriors from, roughly speaking, the area known today as the former Soviet republic of Georgia. And in King Arthur, the Picts, or Woads, are at first the bitterest enemies of Artorius and his men, Later, they became allies against a common foe, the Saxons, and Artorius marries Guinevere, daughter of the Pictish leader and herself their future leader. The Pictish tribe often went into battle naked, believing that this demonstrated their courage, as well as showing off their tattoos. Fortunately for Knightley, something of a warrior princess in King Arthur, the costume designers set out to protect her modesty! Up until now, for the director, writer, producer and the actors, Excalibur had been the definitive movie about the Arthurian legend. But, as Gruffudd said: “You can make an Excalibur, you can make our version of King Arthur, it's a story that's been embellished over the centuries and that's the beauty of it. It is a great story.” t *	King Arthur opens on Friday July 30.

      i was about 10 or 11 years old at the time, me and my friedn tony we looking around the old church hensby, and telling each other creepy tales. as we were walking up the path from the churchyard we'd been looking around all the old gravestones...  and we decided to look inside the church, and we walked into the foyer part at the entrance..it was getting a bit dark, and we walked up to the second door and it slowly opend all by itself all in front of us...it was very slowly and it creaked as it done so....   and we both stood there paralysed with fear we didn't dare move..  then we heard footsteps and we still didn't dare move   and they got closer and closer..echoing the foot steps...  and the ghostly figure of the caretaker walked up in front of us.  he saw our faces and realised what happened...  each time you open the first door the second one opens  and he was walking over to close it.  we still got out of there as fast as we bloody well could though.  told to me by david now

      South Norfolk  The South of Norfolk has many old halls, inns and hotels that are perfect places for ghosts to haunt. From the ghostly 18-year-old who haunts the Three Tuns Hotel in Bungay, the tragic Amy Robsart who wanders around the ruins of Rainthorpe Hall in Tasburgh, and the ghost of the White Lady killed by her jealous husband and can now be seen on the staircase at the Scole Inn near Diss, they're all here!

      "there's bloody loads of ghost stories in norfolk..around the broads, especially with windmills and pubs, cos any old building there's sure to be a ghost story connected with it"  a factory , not a factory really..a warehouse, a place i used to work near great yarmouth was on an old black friars monastery, and there's many a story in the warehouse of ppl seeing a ghostly monk or feeling a presence behind them.  the warehouse place used to supply pipes and flanges and what not all sorts of bits of pieces for off shore oil rig companies. a ship chandler really.  me:what's that?  him:they supply offshore stuff.  me:how do you spell it?  him:chandler.  me: oh! CHANDLER! (didn't catch what he was saying...)  him:they were called North Sea Gas Services and Utilities, doesn't exist anymore.  me:hmm...so that's what Chandler is. (thinking of someone i knew at boarding school who had the surname Chandler)  him:and there's the Old St. NIcholas Hospital, which also used to be the admiralty headquarters, amybe admiralty hospital, and there's a burial like unmarked, where they buried the patients. i knew a security guard who said he heard a woman crying there, and a number of security guards onyl stayed there one night and wouldn't go back. it's now called Queen Elizabeth court i think and it's flats and houses.  me:so they changed it's name?  him:yeah it's the same buildgin just been converted to flats and houses.  me: so the burial ground is still there?  him: yes, apparently so, it's unmarked.

      APRIL 7 - Acle Bridge  If you find yourself on the bridge that spans the river Bure in the village of Acle on the 7th of April, it is said that you will discover a pool of blood, which would not have been there the night before. This pool of blood has two possible contenders for its origin, both of whom met their end on the bridge.

      NORFOLK SURNAMES: B   BUCKET/BURKETT/BOUQUET: Not everyone is happy with the surname they are given and some will try to change it. Patricia Routledge, left, is well-known for her character of Hyacinth Bucket who is always pronouncing the name as though it were a bunch of flowers. If she studied names she might have found that her existing name was preferable as it probably originates from a mispronunciation of the name Burkett, based on an Old English name Burgheard which meant strong fort — implying a hardiness and stolidity which Hyacinth would have revelled in. The name Bouquet, meanwhile, is a French version of Buck which in England was given to a man with a fancied resemblance to a he-goat (either through his Lecherous tendencies or his rancid smell). Hyacinth would obviously have nothing to do with that. Patricia Routledge’s own name is found mainly on the English/Scottish border but its origins are unknown.

       27 July 2004   Rock superstars The Darkness were back in familiar haunts yesterday   as they made a top-secret return to their home town.   Three members of the band – frontman Justin Hawkins, brother Dan and   drummer Ed Graham – returned to their Lowestoft roots with a 'hush,   hush' visit to their old school and a local wildlife park.   The trio were in town to relive some of the past when they opened a   new musical suite at Kirkley High School.   The three had not visited the school together since they made their   names around the world with the multi-million selling album   Permission to Land.   The foursome, who also include Scottish bassist Frankie Poullain,   have won three Brits and numerous other awards around the world for   their brand of glam rock.   But yesterday it was back to the classroom as the boys met some of   their former teachers and tutors for a chat about old times.   They were given a tour of the new music centre, which includes a   recording studio and a production studio and several other music   rooms.   The band members finished their tour of the school by donating Ed's   first drum kit, two guitars and a rock kit.   Deputy headteacher Hazel Johnson said: "It is absolutely wonderful   to see our ex-students who have been successful. It's been a   fabulous afternoon talking to them. I haven't seen them since the   day they left. We talked about their lives and how things have moved   on. They were very generous and left some wonderful gifts. They're   an inspiration and a role model for our students."   After their visit, Justin and mum Sandy made their way in the   singer's E-type Jaguar to the Suffolk Wildlife Park in nearby   Kessingland – and Justin met with his namesake.   Earlier this year, staff at the park named a baby giraffe after   Justin in tribute to the Lowestoft lad's success. The keepers wanted   to honour the locally-born lead singer's wild image and performances   on stage.   They approached the band's management team, and after a couple of   months chasing them around the globe they finally managed to get in   touch. Now the pair will be forever linked after meeting for the   first time.  http://new.edp24.co.uk/

      "Among the Chukchee [4] family shamanism, being quite simple and primitive, probably preceded individual shamanism, and the latter seems to have grown out of the former. The mother shares with the father the róle of shaman in the family ceremonials; she has charge of the drum and amulets, and in exceptional cases it is she, and not the father, who performs the family sacrifice. Thus shamanism is not restricted to either sex, but 'the gift of inspiration is thought to be bestowed more frequently upon women, though it is reputed to be of a rather inferior kind, the higher grades belonging rather to men. The reason given for this is that the bearing of children is generally adverse to shamanistic inspirations, so that a young woman with considerable shamanistic power may lose the greater part of it after the birth of her first child.'[5]"   note: could this be because some of her power is given to her child?

      1. Among several tribes traditions exist that the shaman's gift was first bestowed on woman. In Mongolian myths goddesses were both shamans themselves-like the Daughter of the Moon-and the bestowers of the shamanistic gift on mankind.  2. Neo-Siberians nearly all have a common name for the -woman-shaman, while each of these tribes has a special name for the man-shaman. The Yakut call him ayun; the Mongols, buge; the Buryat, buge and bo; the Tungus, samman and khamman; the Tartars, kam; the Altaians, kam and gam; the Kirgis, baksy; the Samoyed, tadibey. The Yakut, it is curious to note, though they have the word khamma, nevertheless do not call the shaman by a name similar to that in use among other Neo-Siberians, but give him a special appellation. This, according to Troshchanski (p. 118), may be explained by the fact that when the Yakut appeared in the present Yakut district they did not possess a man-shaman, but they had already a woman-shaman, for whom all these tribes have a name in common. Among Mongols, Buryat , Yakut, Altaians, Turgout, and Kirgis, the following names for the woman-shaman occur, utagan, udagan, ubakan, utygan, utügun, iduan, duana. All these words come from a root the meaning of which has not been certainly determined. In some Tartaric dialects üdege, 'female shaman', means also 'housewife' and 'wife'. In Tungus, utakan means 'sorcerer' and 'cannibal'; but utagan seems to be a Mongol word in origin According to Potanin and Banzaroff, the term in question is etymologically connected with the Mongol word Etugen, hearth-goddess' (Etugen-eke 'mother-earth'). Potanin further connects the word for Earth-Goddess among different Altaic and Finno-Ugric tribes with the names of constellations, especially with the two bear constellations. In one Tartaric dialect utygan means 'bear'. According to ancient Mongol and Chineses myths, the gods of certain constellations are connected with the. protective spirits or the family hearth, just as they are connected with the goddess of the earth. Thus these terms for female shamans are related to the genesis of certain goddesses.]

      Neo-Siberians.  The Yakut. For comparison with the Palaeo-Siberian methods of shamanizing, we shall take a Yakut shaman in action, as described by Sieroszwski.[4] 'Outwardly, shamanistic ceremonies are very uniform,' says Sieroszewski. The ceremony now described 'is the part of the shamanistic ceremony which remains always and everywhere unchanged, and, sanctioned by custom, forms, so to speak, the basis of the rite.'  When the shaman who has been called to a sick person enters the yurta, he at once takes the place destined for him on the  [1.Op. cit., p. 442.  2. Op. cit., p. 444.  3. Satrytcheff, The Voyage of Capt. Sarytcheff's Fleet along the N.E. Coast of Siberia, through The Polar Sea and the Pacific, p. 30.  4. Sieroszewski, 12 Lat w Kraju Yakutów, 1902, p. 639.]  billiryk agon. He lies on his white mare's skin and waits for the night, the time when it is possible to shamanize. Meanwhile he is entertained with food and drink.  'When the sun sets and the dusk of evening approaches, all preparations for the ceremony in the yurta are hurriedly completed: the ground is swept, the wood is cut, and food is provided in larger quantity and of better quality than usual. One by one the neighbours arrive and seat themselves along the wall, the men on the right, and the women on the left; the conversation is peculiarly serious and reserved,, the movements gentle.  'In the northern part of the Yakut district the host chooses the best latchets and forms them into a loop, which is placed round the shaman's shoulders and bold by one of those present during the dance, in order to prevent the spirits from carrying him off. At length every one has supper, and the household takes some rest. The shaman, sitting on the edge of the billiryk, slowly untwists his tresses, muttering and giving orders. He sometimes has a nervous and artificial hiccough which makes his whole body shake; his gaze does not wander, his eyes being fixed on one point, usually on the fire.  'The fire is allowed to die out. More and more deeply the dusk descends on the room; voices are hushed, and the company talks in whispers; notice is given that anybody -wishing to go out must do so at once, because soon the door will be closed, after which nobody can either go out or come in.  'The shaman slowly takes off his shirt and puts on his wizard's coat, or, failing that, he takes the woman's coat called sangyniah.[1] Then he is given a pipe, which he smokes for a long time, swallowing the smoke; his hiccough becomes louder, he shivers more violently. When he - has finished smoking, his face is pale, his head falls on his breast, his eyes are half-closed.  'At this point the white mare's skin is placed in the middle of the room. The shaman asks for cold water, and when he has drunk it he slowly holds out his hand for the drum prepared for him; he then walks to the middle of the room, and, kneeling for a time on his right knee, bows solemnly to all the four corners of the world, at the same time sprinkling the ground about him with the water from his mouth.  [1. Gmelin speaks of special embroidered stockings which the shaman, dons in the yurta. (Reise durch Sibirien, pp. 351-6.)]  'Now everything is silent. A handful of white horsehair is thrown on the fire, putting it quite out; in the faint gleam of the red coals the black motionless figure of the shaman is still to be seen for a while, with drooping bead, big drum on breast, and face turned towards the south, as is also the head of the mare's skin upon which he is sitting.  Complete darkness follows the dusk; the audience scarcely breathes, and only the unintelligible mutterings and hiccoughs of the shaman can be heard; gradually even this sinks into a profound silence. Eventually a single great yawn like the clang of iron breaks the stillness, followed by the loud piercing cry of a falcon, or the plaintive weeping of a seamew-then silence again.  'Only the gentle sound of the voice of the drum, like the humming of a gnat, announces that the shaman has begun to play.  'This music is at first soft. delicate, tender, then rough and irrepressible like the roar of an oncoming storm. It grows louder and louder and, like peals of thunder, wild shouts rend the air; the crow calls, the grebe laughs, the seamews complain, snipes whistle, eagles and hawks scream.'  'The [1] music swells and rises to the highest pitch, the beating of the drum becomes more and more vigorous, until the two sounds combine in one long-drawn crescendo. The numberless small bells ring and clang; it is not a storm-it is a whole cascade of sounds, enough to overwhelm all the listeners.... All at once it breaks off-there are one or two strong beats on the drum, which, hitherto held aloft, now falls to the shaman's knees. Suddenly the sound of the drum and the small bells ceases. Then silence for a long moment, while the gentle gnat-like murmur of the drum begins again.'  [1. Sieroszewski, op. cit., p. 641.]  This may be repeated several times, according to the degree of the shaman's inspiration; at last, when the music takes on a certain new rhythm and melody, sombrely the voice of the shaman chants the following obscure fragments:  1. 'Mighty bull of the earth . . . Horse of the steppes!' 2. 'I, the mighty bull . . . bellow!' 3. 'I, the horse of the steppes . . . neigh!' 4. 'I, the man set above all other beings!' 5. 'I, the man most gifted of all!' 6. 'I, the man created by the master all-powerful! 7. 'Horse of the steppes, appear! teach me!' 8. 'Enchanted bull of the earth, appear! speak to me!' 9. 'Powerful master, command me!' 10. 'All of you, who will go with me, give heed with your ears! Those whom I command not. follow me not!' 11. 'Approach not nearer than is permitted! Look intently! Give heed ! Have a care!' 12. 'Look heedfully! Do this, all of you . all together . . . all, however many you may be!' 13. 'Thou of the left side, O lady with thy staff, if anything be done amiss, if I take not the right way, I entreat you - correct me! Command! . . .' 14. 'My errors and my path show to me! O mother of mine! Wing thy free flight! Pave my wide roadway!' 15. 'Souls of the sun, mothers of the sun, living in the south, in the nine wooded hills, ye who shall be jealous . . . I adjure you all . . . let them stay . . . let your three shadows stand high!' 16. 'In the East, on your mountain, lord, grandsire of mine. great of power and thick of neck-be thou with me!' 17. 'And thou, grey-bearded wizard (fire), I ask thee: with all my dreams, 'with all comply! To all my desires consent . . . Heed all! Fulfil all! . . . All heed . . . All fulfil!'[1]  At this point the sounds of the drum are heard once more, once more wild shouts and meaningless words-then all is silent.  Adjurations similar to the above are used in all the Yakut districts and all ceremonies begin with them. There is, however, another formula still longer and more complicated, which Sieroszewski says he could not procure. The ritual which follows this formula consists of an improvisation appropriate to each person and occasion.  In the ensuing prayers the shaman addresses his ämägyat and other protective 'spirits'; be talks with the kaliany, asks them questions, and gives answers in their names. Sometimes the shaman must pray and beat the drum a long time before the spirits come; often their appearance is so sudden and so impetuous that the shaman is overcome and falls down. It is a good sign if he falls on his face, and a bad sign if he falls on his back.  'When the ämägyat comes down to a shaman, he arises and  [1. Sieroszewski, op. cit., pp. 641-2.]  begins to leap and dance, at first on the skin, and then, his movements becoming more rapid, he glides into the middle of the room. Wood is quickly piled on the fire, and the light spreads through the yurta, which is now full of noise and movement. The shaman dances, sings, and beats the drum uninterruptedly, jumps about furiously, turning his face to the south, then to the -west, then to the east. Those who hold him by the leather thongs sometimes have great difficulty in controlling his movements. In the south Yakut district, however, the shaman dances unfettered. Indeed, he often gives up his drum so as to be able to dance more unrestrainedly.  'The head of the shaman is bowed, his eyes are half-closed his hair is tumbled and in wild disorder lies on his sweating face, his mouth is twisted strangely, saliva streams down his chin, often he foamgs at the mouth.  'He moves round the room, advancing and retreating, beating the drum, which resounds no less wildly than the roaring of the shaman himself; he shakes his jingling coat, and seems to become more and more maniacal, intoxicated with the noise and movement.  'His fury ebbs and rises like a wave; sometimes it leaves him for a while, and then, holding his drum high above his head, solemnly and calmly he chants a prayer and summons the "spirit".  'At last he knows all he desires; be is acquainted with the cause of the misfortune or disease with which be has been striving; he is sure of the help of the beings whose aid he needs. Circling about in his dance, singing and playing, be approaches the patient.  'With new objurgations be drives away the cause of the illness by frightening it, or by sucking it out with his mouth from the painful place: then, returning to the middle of the room, he drives it away by spitting and blowing. Then he learns what sacrifice is to be made to the "powerful spirits", for this harsh treatment of the spirit's servant, who was sent to the patient.  'Then the shaman, shading his eyes from the light with his hands, looks attentively into each corner of the room; and if he notices anything suspicious, he again beats the drum, dances, wakes terrifying gestures, and entreats the " spirits ".  'At length all is made clean, the suspicious "cloud" is no more to be seen, which signifies that the cause of the trouble has been driven out; the sacrifice is accepted, the prayers have been heard-the ceremony is over.  'The shaman still retains for some time after this the gift of prophecy; he foretells various happenings, answers the questions of the curious, or relates what he saw on his journey away from the earth.  'Finally he is carried with his mare's skin back to his place of honour on the billiryk'.[1]  The sacrifice offered to the 'spirits' varies according to the importance of the occasion. Sometimes the disease is transferred to the cattle, and the stricken cattle are then sacrificed, i. e. ascend to the sky.[2] It is this journey to the sky, together with the spirits and the sacrificed animal, which the dance symbolizes. In the old days (according to the native accounts) there were, in fact, shamans who really did ascend into the sky while the spectators saw how 'on the clouds there floated the sacrificed animal, after it sped the drum of the shaman, and this was followed by the shaman himself in his wizard's coat'.[3]  There were also wicked and powerful shamans who, instead of a real animal, carried up into the sky a mare formed of cloud, but the evidence for the existence of these shamans is indefinite. During this difficult and dangerous journey every shaman has his places of rest, called ouokh (olokh); when he takes a seat during the dance, this signifies that he has come to an ouokh;[4] when he rises, he is ascending further tip into the sky; if he falls down, he is descending under the earth.  Every shaman, however far be may have proceeded on his journey, knows where he is, on which ouoloh, and also the route taken by every other shaman who is shamanizing at that moment. Sometimes the leading of the ' spirit' and the sacrificed cattle into the sky forms a separate ceremony performed a few months after the first, in which they had promised this sacrifice. The sacrifices are either bloody, when the shaman tears to pieces the  [1. Sieroszewski, op. cit., p. 644.  2. Troshchanski says (p. 105): 'Instead of the human kut which the abassy had captured, he receives an animal kut. Usually, between the spirit who took away the kut of the man and the representative of the latter, there takes place (through the shaman) a keen bargaining, in which the spirit gives up some of its demands.'  3. Sieroszewski, op. cit., p. 645.  4. These ouokh occur in a series of nine, in conformity with the usual arrangement of objects in nines which characterizes the whole religious and social system of the Yakut. (Sieroszewski, op. cit., p. 472.)]  body of the animal with rage and fury, or bloodless; e. g. when some grease or meat, or other material, such as hair, &c., is offered up.

      Chinese Compatibility You: Horse  Your partner: Monkey This could end up being a quick, but rather unforgettable, match. It's somewhat like a trip with no destination, because you have a mutual problem with commitment. A Horse can't decide! The Monkey is afraid one will interfere with all of the other parts of life. And, uniting seems like such a good idea in heat of passion you stir. Should you get this far, you do well financially, lucky, but extravagant.

      The white and black shamans, the Buryat say, fight with each other, hurling axes at one another from distances of hundreds of miles. The white shaman serves the West tengeri and West khats, and has charge of the ceremonies held at birth, marriage, &c. He wears a white coat and rides a white horse. A famous white shaman was Barlak of the Balagansk district, at whose grave his descendants still go to worship.  The black shaman serves the tengeri and khats of the East. These shamans are said to have power to bring illness and death upon men. They are not liked, but much feared, by the people, who sometimes kill black shamans, to such a point does this dislike develop.[1] The grave of a black shaman is usually shaded by aspens, and the body is fastened to the earth by a stake taken from this tree.

      I've been reading this text online. And it is more along the lines of an academic text.  Not neo-religious make money, shamanism from some one suspect that wnats your hard earned cash, or even a little bit of it. Look it's okay to give payment for such services, but 100's of dollars?  Well, anyway, if you want to know about such matters for real, then this is good reading.

      Dark side of glam  The Darkness has been one of the most prominent and outrageous rock bands of recent years. ZACK YUSOF chats with main man Justin Hawkins, who clearly isn’t too happy with the commercial pressures of rock ’n’ roll life.   HAILING from the unfashionable coastal town of Lowestoft – the most easterly town in England – The Darkness was born when spandex jumpsuit-wearing lead singer Justin Hawkins, the man with that amazing jet-engine falsetto, and his guitarist brother Dan decamped to London and hooked up with exiled Scot bassist Frankie Poullain and drummer Ed Graham.       SO COOL TO BE UNCOOL: The Darkness are (clockwise from top) Frankie Poullain, Justin Hawkins, Ed Graham and Dan Hawkins.With its line up in place, the band began playing North London’s pubs regularly, slowly building up a following through word of mouth with its scintillating live performances.   With its infectious blend of anthemic hard rock and flamboyant showmanship, complete with virtuoso guitar solos, killer hooks, and massive sing-along choruses, British rockers The Darkness has somehow managed to seduce audiences round the world, seemingly against all odds.   But for the longest time, it seemed that the band’s anti-cool stance would conspire to work against it. Flying in the face of fashion, The Darkness opted to play bombastic good time stadium rock instead of trendy indie rock.    Since the release of its Mercury Prize winning debut album Permission To Land, The Darkness has been thrust into the limelight, transforming the band members’ lives into an endless blur of live performances, award ceremonies, A-list parties and airports.    The United States has also taken to The Darkness in a big way with Permission To Land shifting over 500,000 units there, an impressive figure for a British act. Magazines that took two years to promote The Strokes have decided to put The Darkness on their covers after one single. Over in the United States, The Darkness is not perceived as an ironic band but one that rocks, and rocks hard. Looking at the way they have embraced The Darkness, it would appear that its music was seemingly tailor-made for American consumption.   The way singer Justin Hawkins tells it, the band never had any doubts that its moment of glory would arrive eventually. It’s just that success has come sooner rather than later for the band – not that he is complaining about it.    “We did think that Permission To Land would start to catch on eventually. But we thought we’d release the second album and then everyone would go back and discover the first one,” admitted Hawkins in a recent phone interview from Barcelona in Spain. “We thought that success would be a more gradual process.”   But global success for The Darkness has come with a price. After two years trawling around the world in support of Permission To Land, the band is ready to stop touring and take a well-earned break.   Hawkins was in an irritable mood during this evening phone-in (Malaysian time) and he wasn’t hiding that fact.    “Yeah, we are getting to the point where we want to stop,” sighed Hawkins, sounding exhausted and a lot like he would rather be anywhere else but in Spain with the band doing an endless succession of dreaded “promo”.    “We still enjoy the buzz of playing live but at the moment, we have been made to do a lot of things that are what I would call a complete waste of time. It’s just because the schedule was put in a long time ago and then the record company added some more things to it to capitalise on the success of the album. Because of the changes that have happened, the band is doing a lot of things that are quite unnecessary. It will sort itself out but we are getting to the point where we want to put our foot down and say no more. I guess the best thing about success is not having to put up with record company bulls**t.”   According to Hawkins, who sounded serious and slightly short-fused throughout the interview – a direct contrast to his comical, larger-than-life on-stage persona, the main problem lies with the fact that the band simply do not have the time to sit down and write any new material – such is the intensity of their workload.   “We haven’t got any time to write new material which is why something has to be sorted out soon,” he stated firmly. “It’s not something that worries me though. Because we did so well with the first album, we can do whatever we want now. We are not going to put it out unless we are happier with it – so the sooner we start on it, the better it will be.”   What about the curse of the sophomore album, then?    “I don’t subscribe to all that ‘difficult’ second album nonsense. It’s not difficult at all. All you do is that you stop (touring), have a long break, become a human being again and then start writing the album. We are award-winning songwriters and it isn’t difficult for us to make the next album. We’ve just got to exert our newfound importance really and let everyone know that we are going to do whatever we want and no one’s going to make us do otherwise.”   With the band’s popularity on the rise, especially in America, and Permission To Land doing brisk business around the world, it may however prove problematical for the band to just stop and take a long break. Nevertheless Hawkins maintains that rather than to carry on touring and running the risk of burning themselves out in the process, it would be better for the band in the long run if they just took some time out.   “I can honestly say that I don’t apply any more importance to America than I do Malaysia, no more importance to Luxembourg or Britain. The fact is, for the band’s sake, we are going to stop, you know? That’s the most important thing. We don’t feel any pressure to have to represent England in America or anything like that. We’re not a band that plays up our ‘Britishness’. We’re not a cool Britannia kind of band. We’re about rock, really.”   With regard to the band’s Stateside success, Hawkins simply puts it down to hard rock’s re-emergence and the fact that people in America apparently don’t like being told what to listen to, a fact that is reflected in the country’s diverse music scene.   “I think they like bands like us who have a little bit of a rebellious streak. I think they took to us because we don’t sound like anybody else and that’s exciting to them. What advice have we got for bands trying to be successful in America? Do what ever you want and don’t listen to the record company.”   The Darkness has achieved worldwide success – always playing by its own rules.    “We don’t care about being cool. I mean, there’s nothing cool about wearing skin-tight catsuits. Nobody wears catsuits. I think it’s more important to be uncool. It doesn’t annoy me that some people perceive us as a joke band because those people are usually full of sh*t.    “Usually these are people who haven’t heard the album. I think that people who hate it don’t hate it for musical reasons. People who love it have more than one reason to love it, you know? I don’t think a lot of people fully understand it but for some reason, there’s chemistry on the record that people have been attracted to. It’s unexplainable really.”   *	The Darkness’ Permission To Land is available through Warner Music.

The name of the record is called "Attention Dimension".   The new album features one Chili Peppers member. "Flea played on a couple of the tracks" he says.   Irons was an original member of Red Hot Chili Peppers, forming the band with fellow Fairfax High School students Hillel Slovak, Anthony Kiedis, and Michael Balzary (Flea).  Lyons left Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 after the death if Slovak and formed Eleven. While in Eleven, two of his friends Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament asked him to recommend a singer for their new band and he recommended a guy from San Diego named Eddie Vedder. Pearl Jam was born.   Irons was invited to join Pearl Jam at that point but stayed with Eleven. Years later the invitation arose again and Irons became Pearl Jam's drummer between 1986 and 1988. He left Pearl Jam in 1998 for health reasons.   'Attention Dimension' will be his first new music since then.   By Paul Cashmere   August 2 2004

      BAD LOOKING  Aug 2 2004  Jacko voted world's ugliest man  By Emma Britton   MICHAEL Jackson's looks are so off the wall that women think he is the ugliest man on the planet, according to a survey.  Competition for the title was fierce, with ginger whinger Chris Evans and pint-sized pop star Peter Andre second and third.  The list was compiled by women's magazine Company.  Also in the top 10 unsexy chart were Oasis star Liam Gallagher, dentally challenged Darkness singer Justin Hawkins and the Pop Idol pairing of judge Simon Cowell and the show's runner-up Gareth Gates.  Bizarrely, some on the ugly list also featured high on the mag's chart of the world's 100 sexiest men, notably footballer David Beckham and pop stars Robbie Williams and Justin Timberlake.  Troy star Brad Pitt topped the sexy chart in the year he turned 40.  British actor Orlando Bloom, Legolas the elf in Lord of the Rings, was runner-up, followed by EastEnders star Nigel Harman.  Beckham was fourth. Fifth was Timberlake, last year's winner.  A spokeswoman for Company said: 'Pitt proves that turning 40 and donning a leather skirt can do wonders for a man's sex appeal.'  Editor Victoria White added: 'It's fantastic that three out of thetop five are British. It's nice to know we can hold our own in the lust stakes.'

      i had just told my friend yesterday, that when i write poetry, which is not that often these days. but i don't care about making it rhyme. i just put down what comes into my mind. sometimes it rhymes. a lot of it to me is like painting a picture. maybe a bit more akin to jazz.  but here a good tool the rhyming dictionary and thesaurus. maybe i'll manage some rhymes now.  i do prefer them to come spontaneously though.

      also it's giving me achievable goals, and i have had a tendency in the past. to imagine the huge result, and underestimate the amount of time it takes to achieve.  also, i am out of practice, since i am no longer working, and school days are long gone, well except for the few college course i've taken that is on celtic studies, and archaeology, but i found i was learning things i had learned long ago at lehigh, and was a bit bored.  interesting how the brain retains it, and it kicks in in that  education environment.

      my guitar lesson is at 11am or so, when my teacher arrives here. so the latest will be noon. then an hour or so of me attempting to keep up with him playing fast. :D he says he's pushing me. but i have been practicing, only i seem to go slightly slower while practicing, then when he's here telling me the next chord to play. i'm quite enjoying it though. at it's good to have goals, and also good to see obvious improvement in a short time. makes me feel much better accomplishing something.  my forte definately isn't scheduling. not lately anyway. but just making sure i practice each day, gets me thinking back into scheduling and making plans, goals.

      Build Your Own Stonehenge Dennis Randall     Building Directions   Age: 8 and up Time: 1 to 2 hours Type of Activity: Science   Materials needed:   *	Center stake for reference point.  *	50 feet of rope.  *	20 to 30 marker stones or small stakes.  *	A compass.  Here's a unique way to celebrate the solstice: Build your own Stonehenge. As you might know, Stonehenge is one of the oldest (4,000+ years) and best known astronomical calendar sites in the world. You can recreate it without going through the bother of lugging 25 to 50 ton slabs of rock around the neighborhood. All you'll need is a bit of ambition, and a location offering an unobstructed view of the eastern or western horizon. Locations offering a 360º horizon view are ideal (and rare).   What to do   The first thing you'll need to do is create a viewing circle. Anchor a reference stake at the center point of the circle and place your compass on top of it. Find due north and place a marker at 50 feet north of the center. Repeat the process for east, west and south. (The rope is used as a guide to insure that all markers are equidistant from the center stake.) Again, using the rope as a guide, place a small marker stone every few feet around the perimeter of your circle. The center of the circle now becomes your fixed reference point and the westward facing perimeter is where you'll be placing the sunset markers.   The calendar can be started at any time, but the solstice sunsets are the most fun. Mark the point of sunset with a pole, stake or other (not easily moved) marker. Tag the marker with the date of sunset.   Repeat the process every seven days or so. Over the weeks and months you'll note that the sun appears to "walk" faster at some times of the year than others. When you've finished (in a year's time) you'll have a working astronomical calendar and an excuse to invite friends and classmates over to the house to check the date ;-)   Non-construction alternatives   *	Photo-op: Take a snapshot of the western skyline and tape it to the wall by a western facing window. With a felt tip marker draw an arrow on the photo corresponding to the point of sunset and note the date. Repeat the process.   *	Window marks: (This takes two people.) Standing at the same point in the room of a western facing window, have the other person make a small mark on the glass where the sun sets. Note the date and repeat the process on a weekly basis.
