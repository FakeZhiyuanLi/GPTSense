      In all oddness, I think the dude is a a true one-woman man. He can't deal with more than one female friend at a time, evidenced by his lack of presence these past few months (ever since new girl entered). Wonder who he'll get next...

      Jam went off with a few hitches, but we got everyone in to play who wanted to, and everyone in to watch who wanted to.  There were a couple of people who didn’t get on the list, and then some who said they’d emailed someone and were told they were in. Well, you got in, and that’s great. Just remember, I’m anal, and when a message goes out saying to email a specific address, email that, or have a friend email it with your name. Emailing someone else and having them say you can come ain’t gonna cut it. You know why? Cause the person handling reservations won’t have you, and you’ll be waitlisted just like someone walking in the door.  I know one person sent her email to the wrong address (she wasn’t in the inbox), which is sad  and puts her in the mistake category instead of the not paying attention on to how to make a reservation. The latter irritates me since at least 37 other people figured it out.  Super mellow super angsty today.  If I don’t mellow out I’ll freak out into hysterics over the backlog and quit.  Bad idea. A few more months, then change. I’m very combative today, resistant. The weekend was so fun and so different. I don’t like being here one bit. Geez I suck at dealing with stress. Run away, run away!  Blah.

      This is some  urlLink fucked up shit . Good going for the girl though for not giving up.  There really are people who need to be put away forever. Why the hell people can't see that, I don't know.

      I am so angry. Not grrr angry, frustrated angry. I don't know why I came here to post, since I can't really vent here with any specifics. Grrr. Damn it.  Lots of heat, nice thunderstorms.  Let me think of a metaphor. I'm in a car. I'm a passenger. Someone else is drivign. I switch cars often, always otehr drivers. I have a pilot control of my own, but I like the company.  The drivers are eager to arrive, but they don't take the best routes, drive to close, too slow, and are just plain annoying to ride with.  You'd like to yell as they get passed by a better driver in a crappier car, but then they'll fuss at you being a backseat driver or ask you to take the wheel. And well, you still just have your learners permit. This is big city traffic.  The other doctor thinks it's a stroke or brain tumor. My orignal thoughts too. She had surgery for essentially breast cancer a couple fo years ago, and has a little growth on her mouth (a tiny nubbin, nothing nasty) that came back.  Her back legs don't even work now.  I hope mother can get her up to VA to be out in the woods one last time.

      This corresponds to an earlier posting on  urlLink TAMPU .  Based on what my mom read over the phone, it sounds like Kiwi's having a stroke. The dog who ate a napkin b/c there was a piece of meat attached to it turns away from taco bell meat and can barely muster drinking water. She's lost or is losing circulation to her back limbs and continues to drool (a sign of nausea apparently).  My poor little cutie's ill. Can't write much more now. I'll keep you posted as I hear more.

      The main reason for this page: the weather pixie. I couldn't justify it on my original site, what with all the links already crowding the place.  At some point, a use for this page will come to me. Give it some time.

      Super busy here with work.&nbsp; Wow, haven't been so productive in ages, it's fantastic. Of course, I'm loading up on Sugar like a mo-fo adn will defeintley gain a few pounds over the next month, but hopefully I'll switch back into the like-to-be-healthy&nbsp; mode and cut out the colas again. But oh, how fun the rush is!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What else? Oh, reading.&nbsp; Yes, hmm.&nbsp; Ok, no idea where to go with that.&nbsp; There we go, my general angst of the day: status.&nbsp; How long can I keep this boy interested?&nbsp;I'm just expecting him to come to the conlcusion that he's really not all that interested after all.  &nbsp;  Yes, he's infatuated right now, but for how long?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  My mind just wandered far away.&nbsp; In summary, I care for the boy, a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Speaking of dreams, remind me to tell you about the Kerry dream, and the one with the finches.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Men bother me. Like women bother men. What the hell's wrong with your minds?  Busy week ahead.  I really don't understand all this relationship stuff, but i won't vent in details here. Decisions need to be made and I keep leaning a particular way. I don't know really, maybe it's my mood and I should hold off finalizing anything. Yeah, my mind's in mild destructo-mode.  Not a time to decide anything.  ugh.

      Pepsi, dark chocolate Mounds, Reese's Cup, lots of work.  Either I'll be ready to toss the radio out the window in about twenty minutes, or I'll be so overloaded with sugar and caffeine I'll be comatose and able to work.  Let's hope for the latter. These angry afternoons are getting old fast. Marching around downtown in the heat however, seems to help.  Good morning, good presentation. So much i can do. It's just this damn "need to" do stuff. Oh ho ho, yes, you should never "need" to do anything. It's a bad stress-inducing term. Practically however, you do "need" to do your job. Otherwise you get fired. Urgh. venting on a subject that if i vent about I'll just get angry, so I'm moving on. New thoughts. Aren't you so very glad you don't live with me? Sheesh.

      People, please watch  urlLink Manor House .  It’s a very interesting experiment and sociology study on status and the whole master servant mentality.  After watching the series, I’m starting to wonder how accurate the piece is.  It seems quite genuine, but just was we have certain stereotypes or expectations about particular people (this is an excessively broad example, but country people are slow and city people are fast), I wonder if the youngest participants in the servants quarters are really so 21st century influenced, or if those ideas, and of course various rule-breaking, occurred a little more than records etc would show.  Considering the need for formality and order in that society, it seems quite logical that many things (and we find out about some awful things that did happen) could have been swept under the rug.  I will now have to rewatch the Altman film about the same time period.  I saw it when it first came out and simply hated it, but after getting a bit of insight into why people acted the way they did, I think I’ll get more out of it.   I’m amazed at the psychological impact of the lifestyle on these people.  You’ll see people change with this series, and it reminds me of those experiments people mention where classes are segregated using colored ribbons and yellow ribbons get more rights than blues and the like.  It’s frightening how easily people fall into their roles, how easy it is, and how comfortable many people become being at the top and seeing at as the natural order of things.   The blindness of people is so frightening.  If you can muster it, I recommend reading  VITAL LIES SIMPLE TRUTHS: The Psychology of Self Deception  by Daniel Goleman and really thinking about what this guy says.  I don’t think I even agree with it fully, as he bases much of his arguments on Freud, but the overall concept (especially biological origins) makes such perfect sense.  You have to fist realize that you have blinders, then figure out where they are, then why, then maybe you can fix it.  Maybe you can’t, but please try to think just a bit, think about why you say what you say, think about how someone else might view it, and, which was a big shock for me, put it in a new context.    A few years back I once made a most horrid comment to my friend about people rioting in the Philippines because it’s warmer weather and maybe they’re just more easily irritated (I still can’t believe this was a logical conclusion in my head), which lead to an argument, and after thinking about it for a bit realized it was entirely racist and the biggest load of bullshit ever.  And the comment came because I wasn’t thinking, because I was taking the world in from my own perspective as a fairly well off American and thinkng, lots of people in warmer climates seem unhappy and some 19th century theorist had propsed a concept of "natures" determined by climiate, why the hell that seemed like a good person to use to try and figure the situation out, I don't know (and not thinking maybe because life is shitty and people are treated like dirt in places where people riot, there's a GOOD DAMN reason for it). The speeches presented at graduation last year really sum this all up, especially the one by the sociologist: "there is no them, there is only us."  I'll see if I can find the full peice to put up.  It was beautiful.   The US has been an empire for quite awhile, and we’ve still got that moronic attitude about it all.  Although recently, we’ve acted in the more traditional imperial sense of things and just started knocking off country’s and putting our own leadership in, but early on, at least in the states, many of the countries we now inhabit were places where military bases stood, for protection, were protectorates and other mumbo-jumbo to hide the fact that we are still colonizers, as much as we like to think we’re not and just out there trying to bring democracy to the world. Ugh.  I’m making little sense right now and probably coming off as, oh, I don’t care right now.  I’m really pissed at the attitudes of a lot of people, of the indifference people have to each other, of the thought that might makes right, that the ends justify the means and that as the US we know what’s best for everyone, and that’s for us to be number one. I love my country, I really do, and I will defend it, so don’t read this and think I’m un-American.  Call my old fashioned for thinking treating your neighbors with respect, and working through truth and understanding will open more doors and make the US a safer place.  Blowing people up makes enemies, whether you’re on your own or in a tank.  For all those on the religious side, maybe you can understand; it’s about the soul of the country, and not just the body.

      Had class last night, and a blast as usual!  Last week I arrived early, but the doors were locked, and as I was staring up at a tree trying to figure out what the mass of brown was, someone was calling my name.  I looked around, and didin't see anybody on the sidewalk.  Then, a hand started waving from the car parked out front and the driver shouted at me again.  It was one of my classmates, she apparently arrives early every week just to get that spot.  So I joined her in the dry car, and slowly more people showed up, the building's still locked, and eventually we had five people sitting inside waiting.  Well this week, similar scenario, although the weather was actually nice, but it was fun just to pile in the car.  Another class was also meeting, and they hung around the steps.  7:30 rolled around and we're still all waiting.  Then the people from the steps get up en masse and start walking towards the car.  They surround us and start staring, saying nothing.  We had the windows down and couldn't get them up, so we started chanting o-we-o, o-weeee-o, etc and burst out laughing.  We're such weird people but so much fun too.  Improvisers are always ready to play, a lot like kids really!  I won't bore (that's probably the wrong one, huh?) you with details, but overall we worked on justification and status, with some fun games and card tricks.  You'd a needed to be there to really enjoy it.  What amazes me though is how good our teacher is.  He's moving in a bit, but I'll let you know if he ends up teaching elsewhere.  He's a bit like a guru, providng a bit of direction so that we have to try and figure it out for ourselves, and once we have the idea, explaining a bit more and opening the "aha, of course" door of enlightenment.  They're losing a wonderful teacher in that one.  The classmates are cool as well; everyone's quite talented (for run-of the mill ordinary folk, a few are good even on the good scale) and very supportive.  I'm sure there are cut-throat people out there in improv, but so far we've been pretty lucky with our classes and improvisers in this town in general.  That's really the nature of improv: trust and cooperation.  People crash and burn like  a traffic tie-up for an unintersting wreck when these elements are missing.  Only two classes left, and then off to our showcase.  Hehe.  Can't wait to get up and do a show again.  It's been so long. Sigh.  This just popped up - Remember the saying, "Life is what happens to you when you're making other plans?" Well, scenes are what happen when you're playing other games!

      After reading a bit more, it seems there are plenty of people trying to enlighten out there, so I'll just try to amuse instead...this is one of those moments when you wish you had a cute picture to put up, but I've managed to missplace pretty much everything useful.  Here's a short plug: check out  urlLink Washington Improv Theater  and watch some fun videos the group put together.  I'm not a member, just help out every now and then, but they're a fun bunch of people.  Oh, and the first clip is an actual commercial, as opposed to the rest which are their own material.  Let's try a little bit of instant writing and see what comes, shall we? A lot of these work well for classes too, or just for your own procrastination.  Take two unrelated sentences (made up, or you could pull them from elsewhere I guess) and make a new sentence connecting them:  1)Aardvarks ran in circles 2)My mother really likes apples  My mother trained aardvarks to run in circles using an apple as bait.  1)Stan is an avid fan of Darwin. 2)Next year, the triathletes competition will be canceled  Stan decided since none of his teams ever won, they weren’t fit to compete, so he shot them all.  1)Grains of dust fell from the sky 2)Nanny stubbed her toe on the dresser  When nanny stubbed her toe, the whole house shook, and dust fell off the roof onto the sidewalk below.  1)Twister was a lot of fun until Jan joined. 2)Mike’s favorite song always depressed him.  Mike began to like twister with Jan, because it reminded him of his favorite song.  *remember to be quick about it, and try to keep it simple (unlike me!)  1)Adam has a blue package of oreos 2)Two rabbits are munching on carrots  At snack time in Miss Johnson's class, Adam always ate oreos while watching the rabbits nibble on thier carrots.  Anyway, here's another sample of writing, which hasn't been edited or anything really, so pardon the rawness of it (I don't think it's particualarly rude or anything, just unpolished):  (using last line of previous for first line of next, we'll start out with something unrelated though)  - Mel, my gerbil’s gone missing again - You sure you didn’t leave him back at the campsite. - I, no, he was here in his habitrail ball just before we crossed the creek. Oh NO! - He’s not worth it…we must keep going. - But little sammy samosa, he could drown or get eaten by a big cat, or freeze! Sammy! - I don’t think he’d call back. - Sammy, where are you? (frantically searches the water, creek, stream banks) - He doesn’t even know his name. - Oh no! (she stoops to the ground and picks up the ball) Look at that gash.  Sammy! - Face it he’s gone! And we’ll be gone too if we don’t make it to the next site before dusk.  -- You want to sacrifice your life for a rodent? - (she grabs a flower from the bank and places it in the ball, then sets it in the creek to float away). - (puts his arm around her and the walk off) I’ll buy you a new one when we get home.    - I’ll buy you a new one when we get home. - Dad, she’s my lover, not a whore. - Fine.  Sweetheart, how much to get you to leave my boy alone? - It’s always about you isn’t it? About your goals, your aspirations! I’m an investment banker damn it, and you have to accept that, and that I can be in love. - Damn it boy, where would we be without the farm? Without our organic potatoes?  The world would be a dark, dark place. (girlfriend speaking) I don’t mean to butt in – - (father) then don’t - Leave her alone dad. Cindy, it’s better if you go wait by the sport. - (now noticing the shiny beige Lincoln) A Navigator!? Who’s is it? - Cindy and I bought it together - She’s corrupting you Daniel, a regular temptress. - Dad, she helped put me through college, which is more than I can say for you and your damn potatoes. - Incredible! Those potatoes nourished you when your mom died. - And now I’m allergic. Thanks a lot DAD. (they both stare at each other) I guess this means you’re not coming to the wedding.  - I guess this means you're not coming to the wedding - My flight was, oh, no, I'm not Stan.  I missed the flight on purpose. - How do you think your daughter will feel? - Sarah? Why are you bringing her into this Stan? Why don't you admit you're a bit dissappointed. - Me, care about a wonderful happy home together in the suburbs, just the three of us, starting ouir lives together, a white picket fence -Stan - and a cuddly kitty cat bringing home little gifts to leave on the stoop every morning, why it would be bliss. - This is why I'm still in California - We could get rid of the cat, Snippy can stay with my mom. - You're weak Stan, you're a momma's boy - Cindy, please, I miss you. - And you'd end up raising Sarah into a momma's girl - Cindy, we can work  it out. - No Stan, this is the right decsion.  To stay near her father and contiunue with Rugby. - Cindy! I thought you quit! - I'm sorry Stan.  The call of the ball is stronger than suburbia.

      Ok, now I've looked at a couple of these things and have a better idea where to go with this (there's something fun about jumping on a bandwagon and only knowing partly what you're getting yourself into.  The opposite could also be said, but let's ignore that for now).  I'm setting up links to some interesting places, if I can organize this correctly.  Oh, and to once and for all to state my purpose, it's to enlighten.  Not that I have anything different to say; I tend to find out someone else already had the thought long ago and I'm about 50 years in the dark with things, or just incredibly ignorant, but either way we all need to think more.  And prodding people a bit has always seemed helpful.  You'll find a few improvisation links, the theater-based type as opposed to musical (aka jazz).  I can't express how magnificant improv is to see and to experience first hand.  Ever since stumbling onto it four years ago it's grown on me, and the more you delve into its origns and all of the magnificantness of it, you soon find an almost spiritual apsect to it.  Heck, what's more liberating than letting go of everything and existing within the moment and sharing that with someone else?  I could easily go thorugh a list of why improvisation is so great, but I fear I'd sound like those "All I need to know I learned ____" (insert in kindergarden, from my cat, etc) posters.  It is probably the most amazing art form out there, and if you think I'm nuts for saying this, you have yet to see truly great improv.  Go out and find some.  Improv is popping up everywhere, and if it's not in your town, find some when you go visit somwehere.  By the way, I'm talking about improvisng when I say improv, and not the Improv stand up comedy clubs.  Important point of clarity.  Oh, it's also raining again here.  People keep complaining about it, but the past few years we've been in a major drought.  Appreicate it folks, this may be all we get all year.  Heh, watch that lead to even more rain even through the summer! When it rains it pours, haha.  Sorry.  These are times when I'm glad I live on a hill.

      It's scary how a big empty white space can make your mind go immediately numb.  Anyway, this is only up for a short bit, until there's time to put some actual material up with substance.  As with most everyone, there's plenty to write about and plenty to discuss, but you need to wait for the correct moment every now and then.  Although that thought does inspire me - it's amazing how much trouble people have with discussions, especially here in the states, but it may be true elsewhere.    We're quick to take offense to anything, in fact, we even describe opinions as personal.  Why?  Attaching our identities with our opinions makes it that much harder to talk about subjects, because not only is a belief being challenged, but your own existence at a certain level.  That's such an annoying concept and makes debates at dinner tables, among family, friends, or even associates, virtually non-existent.  Now yes, that's one broad statement and there are tons of people out there who haven't run into these problems.  Lucky you, enjoy it.  I just wish you could hop onto a debate with anyone anytime, and not have to have someone call out "oh, we better not talk politics or religion." Those sorts of discussions are how we learn.  Challenging our own notions of what is and isn't, of how things work, will either make us stronger, or help us better understand the world around us.

      Ick ick ick.  I am sick, with what I don't know, but last night was awful.  I'm still feeling it today.  I don't think I passed out, but then I think I did, but I don't know.  More stable today, still slightly nauseous, headazche, and warm, although afully cold last night, and haven't been cold in a while, bad chills.  I'm really starting to dislike yogurt. Sometimes it gives me headaches, I've had weird reactions eating it and taking aleve (and no longer take aleve), and bad things seem to follow.  But not always.  I don't know if it's type or timing or some additive, or a combo of things.  I know heat played a major factor, although I drank lots of fluids.  Really though, you could over heat and not be dehydrated, which is what I think the problem really is...ugh.    Hey, I'm home today, so people feel free to call me.  I have so much work to do, I hate not being there, but since I almost called someone to see if I should go to a hospital last night, I think it's best I rest.  I'll venture out for a meeting at 6 tonight, more improv things.  This means I'll see MC every Monday for the next eight weeks including this one.  How fun.  Sunday, before being ill, was very nice.  We actually had people out to play, and Mr A came, who we hadn't seen in months! Yay.  The day was nice lying on the picnic bench under the trees and staring off into space.  Once my body adjusts to the warmth I can go out after work everyday and just relax outdoors or at a free concert at the art gardens.  Speaking of free, time to cut back expenses.  I'm outputting more than inputting, esp with the memberships and subscription I set up.  Must hold back for a bit and only do free events, and eat out minimally.

      If you have not seen "He loves me, He loves me not" DO NOT READ any further, unless you don't mind being spoiled.    I knew the movie explores two sides of a relationship, the woman's perspective and the man's, but I was expecting a romantic comedy or some similar fare (sp?).  Holy shit.  Should have looked more closely at the poster.  We see Audrey Tatou's character, all cute and sweet, buying a rose for her new boyfriend.  We follow her affair with a heart doctor, their liasons at parties, the park, her artwork of him, she sends notes, gifts, and yet he keeps leaving her alone, spending time with his pregnant wife.  A close friend of the lead female role confonts the doctor, and the doctor says its over, even if he's an ass.  The lead female slowly falls into a depression, abandoning the plants she's housesitting, obsessing over her former lover, still wanting him.  A news story comes on, and he's been charged with assault.  Tatou's character apparently confonts the woman pressing charges, and the lady dies of a heart attack.  Eventually she's had enough and gases herself.  Well, then we timewarp back to the man's side.  What's revealed is, stop reading now unless you don't mind, there is no affair.  He just starts receiving gifts and notes, stresses his wife out, and has no idea who it is.  She is psycho.  But wait, it gets worse.  He eventually figures out (oh, and he actually saves her life from the suicide attempt, not knowing who she is) the key, and goes to the house, and inside, well, see the movie, but holy fuckin' shit she is totally psyco, erotoaromatic or some sort of disorder.  Scary shit.    I almost screamed, and I definetely gasped in the theater during the film.  In improv we're always taught about how funny reality is; well reality is also scarier than any shit someone can come up with.  Whatever worries I have about being crazy or borderline anything, man I am perfectly normal. Very normal.  Eek to the umpteenth degree on this one folks.  You should be a bit careful about stalkers, but this movie proves even if you never do a thing you can land in trouble. Woah.

      Ya know it's gonna be a good night when you scare off a telemarketer - Oh yeah…fun time with the crew last night, hot diggity dog!  Beer and improv actually are a good combo – who knew?    Ha ha ha, simply marvelously twisted!  Great minds combine to form the awesomest crew around (big o’ grin)…Should I tell each of the stories as they transpired?  Let’s get a rundown, then I’ll give the deets:  Two versions of Typewriter, hitchhiker, 1st line last line, Time warp, café scenes twice, questions game to warm up after some wiz, thank you, and machine.  Great characters and relationships, interesting stories.    Favorite moments:  - “this is a pussyvention”  - “You’re right, I shouldn’t have left her,” to the silent man picked up off the side of the highway - “he became a soldier of fortune,” about the candlestick skater from the Disney Ice Capades  - “hey ma, what’s that light out there?” on why said candlestick was a poor mercenary  - “He met a beautiful woman, wait, scratch that, he met a man who looked kinda like a woman”  - “It’s against the order of nature!”  - “Did your daddy give you that gun?”  -  kung fu dragon-clan lesbians and evil Japanese witch lesbians  Mwa ha ha ha , we will take over the world after all :)   Now I have to sign up for another class.  I really wanted to take a break and focus on other aspects of life, but seeing as how incredibly great these people are to work with, I just can't bare to have them run off without me.  Plus I'm finally getting comfortable with everyone, and lord knows it takes me a bit before I can really get bold with my partners.  I think I made a friend spit his drink out with my "follow the giant penis" comment afterwards.  One weekend left for shows, so COME SEE!

      Update update; everything's cool from earlier in the week.  Managed to get into a foul mood Friday night and actually subjected a couple of people to it who I don't know all that well, which was very bad.  I'm still debating whether to apologize, or if they even really noticed.  But they did, and yes, I had this great moment over the weekend, an epiphany of how to live life: free and open.  Upon my return to the city, I've flipped right back into sheltered mode.  So following what I should set out to do, I will apologize for Friday, as well as give my true opinion on a particular matter, which was originally stated as "ok."  I love the woods.  Jamming tonight, muy alegre por improv!  Of course! Improv Nation had their debut, and were wonderfully funny.  I haven't laughed that hard in ages.  Next Sunday's their last show for a while, so check out the link on the right to WIT and find out more deets.  Ever heard of  urlLink Friendster ? Yeah, joined the bandwagon.  If you're in my network, you'll find me.  I know.  If not, tough beans daddio.

      Finally, a chance to really take it all in and lose myself!  Only took till today, but at least the opportunity finally arose.  The showcase went well overall.  I always have critiques of everything, but seeing as how talented everyone is and many were performing in public for the first time ever it's not the time nor the place to be so snooty.  Most of us ended up at our favorite hang out spot, albeit at seperate tables.  I drank plenty, and finally have been relaxed and open and more my usual self in front  of a lot of the people who don't know a thing about me.  I'm also labeling myself as bi, and it seems everyone's sexual preference was released tonight.  Show and tell or what, i don't know.  Also hung out more with a crush, although not the person I've been yacking about for so long, but who's very comfortable to be around.  Nice thing is, what I thought almost happened last week, was true, and not just my imagination.  So that's a nice vindication.  Had I not been so buzzed, maybe more would result, but as it was, alcohol really does numb your senses.  That's no fun.    And here I am, up early in the morning b/c of the three cokes (most with rum) and whatever shot that was "on the house."  Now to pursue hombre number one, and to keep in touch with hombre dos, but of course now he may think I'm trying to get with him, but I ain't.  He's not good material in that sense, ya know, the kind better to leave alone and be friends with and not take advantage of b/c that's the wrong way to go.  I have a lot of respect for him, and don't want to degrade him like that. Haha, like it was even like that.  Guess I'll go read or something. Yay for socializing though...now I can be unleashed!

      Now that I finally get here I forget what I wanted to talk about. Dang.  Ha, there's one...the man with the plan,  urlLink Rand Beers .  Although a subversive ad for Kerry in the guise of political dissent with Bush, I agree with Beers in the realm of policy decisions.  Inner circles people, don't we remember cliques? You'd think who ever was head of the top of the most powerful country in the world would be open to suggestions, that their advisors would represent a wide array of viewpoints and backgrounds, even within the limited scale of the US (as egocentric as we are collectively, which translates into sheer ignorance about anything outside of our US world).    This is ignorance by choice, in full practice.  You all are driving us into the ground.  Take a look at different perspectives and really think for a change.  Previous groups have taken a bit of alternative views into account, that's how they stayed the course.  But you gentlemen, seem to beleive saying it makes it so, knowing the world the way you do, means that's how the world is, and that everyone else is just a moron.  Well crazy people think they're the only sane ones, and in all honesty, really stupid people think they're the only ones with the good ideas.  Go take an IB course, anything on philospohy or political theory, theory of knowledge, and learn HOW to think and instead of trying to tell people what they think.  You'd be amazed at how quickly everything you want done becomes accomplished.  In egocentric world, our performance is tomorrow.  Lots of good folks coming, and hopefully my cousin can make it.  Argh stress, yet I feel so relaxed now too.  It's out of my hands, and thank goodness for that.  Oh yeah, I love my neigborhood.

      Well that's a night to remember.  Everyone go see SHAME it is incredible, and if you know anything about improv, it will be even more amazing for the amazing abilities of the two performers.  This is theater.  This is amazing.  If you are totally drunk, it may not be as good, b/c you need to try and pay attention a bit, but it's well worth the payoff.  Post show went to get liqour at a bar, but we had a youngin' with us, which lead to a long walk for the next two hours as we tried to find a place to let us all in.  Finally we setttled on a gay dance club which was 18 and up, although at that point half the posse decided one-thirty in the morning is too late.  Nice little confessional of scandalous things people have done, and to top off the evening, one of the guys decided to show us how one part of his anatomy is a different color from the rest of his body.  Yeah, my thought too. Good grief.  Now to try and get drunk tonight, oh and avoid total losers.  They were only a brief encounter, carrying a copy of 1984 and heckling women.  Real smooth.  Email traffic speaks well, so I'm excited for tonight.  Very excited.  Plus the prospect of getting drunk.  Really drunk.  Why in public and with these people, I don't know, but I just want to let go for a bit, take a break form trying to maintain myself. Then sleep. I need to buy some liquor so we have a backup stash here.  Oh, and should clean too. OK, please see SHAME (see links below or check the WIT link to the right).  Big Bang is good too, a lot more games and pace, a different beast.

      So yeah, if you've seen the film Thirteen Days, then you'll understand what happened  urlLink here .  Wild really.  I watched this movie towards the beginning of the rhetoric, and in all honesty was thinking, "I bet this is what's happening up there right now."  There's an old saying about leaders being the center of a wheel, their strength dependent on the spokes around them, and you can really feel that when you compare the different results and the reactions to danger in the film and in today's reality.  One semi-delightful bit of news is that the Justice Department is admitting it went too far, adn plans on doing soemthing about it.  How much exactly and how the attitudes which allowed this happen are still present, we don't know.  But it is a start.  I'm waiting for the whole of the wonderfully delightful Israel and Palestine to disappear off the face of the earth as everyone blows each other to smithereens.  It's really like any other country really, it doesn't matter what the  urlLink people  say, those who are in power will do what they please.  That goes for everyone, whether elected to power or made by force.  We tend to throw dictator out there when the leader isn't one of our allies, president or something else is saved for our friends (remember Pakistan - used to be awful military dictator, now a helpful president).    Everything can be measured by perspectives...every thing you can think of wrong with another country, you can find it in yours, just to another degree, better hidden or more accepted.  We're really all quite the same, the only true difference being which resources we have at our finger tips.  The world isn't peaceful, nature isn't peaceful, but you still would like to be able to live...

      Quite a performance, er, yeah.  The set up was wanting, majorily.  First, you need an audience for improv, and when there's a band playing directly across form you, not only will the audience be focused away, but you're competing with their sound.  Add that you need to use mics, which you never do, and miming goes downhill.  The last game went pretty well, they started breaking the rules and really playing with the conflicts, and the scene finally became interesting.  What was super awesome (and here's why my utter dorkness shines) was warming up with them before hand, just a sprit here or there in some line games while people were trying to remember formats. "Yay for the new people being so nice and unintimidating"  Good PR however, being in the middle of the city after work and lots of people going by, plus the mayor mentioning you. I think all the flyers we handed out beforehand should help, especially for people who have never heard of us.  Let's just hope they didn't throw them out as soon as they got home.  The little pastel flyer, snug in a briefcase outer pocket; the man arrives at his house and tosses it to the side.  He walks to the kitchen and grabs a glass of water, then heads over to the computer to check messages.  He checks his voicemail, nothing.  He sits at his computer, and needs a pen.  He fumbles about and finds the piece of paper, glances then sets it on the desk.  He fumbles a bit more before pulling a pen out, then looks for a scrap to write down a list of to dos for the weekend.  He sees the pastel flyer, flips it over, and scribbles -  food ,  laundry ,  garden  - a vague list, but important.  He goes to turn on ICQ, MSN and IM, and starts scouring for friends online.  Later that night, he wakes up in a sweat, remembering something he left off his list, and ambles through the darkness back to the computer, the pen, the scrap of paper.   Toilet paper .  He underlines it, then wanders back to bed to sleep.  That's probably where they are.  But I will send out vibes to  read your paper, read, the colored handout, no, not the news, no, not from work, the pastel rectangle, the blue card, the orange postcard, read them, and come...come...what is this, you say? Look at  urlLink www.dcwit.com , click on it and find out, then come...   Read it now, otherwise you'll be waking up looking for more than just toilet paper.

      After settling alone and feeling perfectly fine with it all why am I now suddenly hit this desire for companionship? This need to have someone around? To hear the stories makes me wish I had a moment like that, a time in my life of simply being and existing with another person.  And I know this makes no sense, friends, family, random people you've only met briefly, all offer varying levels of coexistence, of being around someone, but this is a different urge and I don't understand it.  It's the desire for a partner, someone to live and share your life with.  What the hell is this?  Is it like being around the pregnant person and your desire for a child kicking in, of having your nest made and wanting that in your life (although it has calmed down quite a bit, in fact is null again)? Because I know it's not the person themself I want, they'd drive me nuts really, but I want to know everything. It's all so strange.

      Yesterday, the world was beautiful.  Past the empty sidewalks, the quite streets humming with a sparse car, past the lost toursits and the homeless sitting on a wall near the park, such quiet solitude pervade through the city that even the beggars took the morning off to chat.  Not until the other side of Penn ave was reached was noise encountered, and then in the form of cafe patrons sitting beneath the clouds and a wedding party posing on the steps.  Strolling through the sculpture garden the eyes were tantilized with invading green from the trees, the bushes, and the grass.  To hear the birds and feel the warm air clear about you as you wound your way along the path, only to be met with the gentle curves of a pefect pool of water, the surface glistening in solitude, tucked away like some secret treasure trove of an english garden.  Ah, the luxury.    Bustling along the sidewalk, dodging the crowds on the mall, a breeze wafted across the plaza carrying the gentlest cool touch of air.  The world was beautiful for that moment, made you thank God for a day so glorious. After passing the deranged pigeon, its feathers puffed out in every which way like a rabid kooshball with foul eyes, my day went downhill.

      Fool and a half! Walked and walked and walked yesterday, probably five miles, which for someone that sits at her desk all day is pretty damn far.  Didn't consume liquids like I should have, so after collapsing on the couch and sleeping I awoke to a lovely pounding headache, as good as any hangover can produce. Yech. Sinus med and fluids remedied the situation however, mostly. Must be more careful.  I'm built for cold weather, not this muggy stuff that pervades most of the east coast.  Another week, and soon, shows! Yipee!

      Early morning, early evening.  I haven't been this happy in a while.  Sleep is so nice. So are interesting people.  Last night I saw a, well, it was supposed to be a play.  The translation was terrible, I think, unless the original script was equally garbage.  We were hoping for some politico piece on superpowers v the world, but it was a convoluted loop of disinterest that the actors wove.  Attrocius, even for a premier.  I felt as if I would pass out a couple of times, my eyes following the actors and my head swimming in meaningless jargon left me litteraly dizzy.  HT said he almost fell asleep watching.  Worse: there were only five people there! Ugh, puts a lot of pressure on you to be a good audience member.  In good news, the assistant director rocks.  We talked before the show and she was really sweet.  She's working on a play even, so I'll have to go see that. She took the flyers I had for WIT's Shame show, so hopefully we'll get some people off of that.  The director after the show announced there were imporvisers in the audience, how sweet.  They seem enthusiastic, so I hope their other works come out better than this. I also have some of their flyers, and feel obligated to give them out...will try...really for karma I have to, it's a good faith thing to do.  3 fuckers were good actually, very odd and probably not their best performance, but they are long form, which means there are now two long form troupes in the dc region.  I managed to plug WIT there too.  I'm starting to behave like a real Washingtonian, constantly networking.  So far I've only offered flyers to a few people, and the others have asked for one after talking with me, which I think is the better way to reach people, as opposed to forcing it on people.  So ask me about the show, and then come see it!

      Well, what do ya know...I've realized my constant searching through websites is an attempt to get a quick fix from anything new and different: new news story, email, anything.  A lovely aspect of an addictive personality, yes? Maybe I am a bit OCD.  In the geat scheme of things, it's better that I'm trying to fire off neurons for a quick high than actually engaging in drugs or the like.  One really great thing about the whole situation however: this is my only problem/worry, and I'm quite fortunate to be able to fret over such a minor issue.  I'd really like to post "Praise God" here, but then that would be a bit religious, which I've never considered myself to be.   In other news, I've finally started reading the Bible.  I remember bits and pieces from Sunday School growing up, and of course the various refernces that run around in our culture, but I'd never really explored the thing.  Mark Twain inspired me with his "Letters from the Earth."  Now I'm taking a very different approach to the reading of it, and trying to get as many perspectives from it as possible.  I still feel it's a history book/literature, and I'm trying to figure out what's been edited and by who.  You really need to think about who the book was meant for, and about the people writing it down and their objectives, about the translators and paradigms; it all matters, and all affects the content.  Maybe I should mention now that I believe in God, but do not see Jesus as any part of the equation, beyond a politcal cult figure with good timing and charisma? I did attend church a few years back, but people kept singing about Jesus and praising Jesus as our Lord and Saviour.  I'm sure he was a great man, but still a man, and to worship him like Christians do is idolatry, an affront to God (OK, sounding religious now).   I went through an agnostic phase for a bit, but upon seeing the phrase "the hottest places in hell are for those who remain neutral" so many times while sitting on the back porch toilet, I figured it'd be good to make a call one way or the other.  You can also look at neutrality of indivduals in times of chaos and war and relate it to cowardice and indifference.  With cowardice, it's just shameful, and with both, you can allow innocent people to be slaugtered as you turn the other way and try to protect yourself or just don't care because it's not you. So take a stand, somewhere, doesn't even have to be a two-sided issue.  There's always more than one "right" it just depends on who wins (Yes, there could well be an absolute right, but if you believe in a higher power it seems only God would ever know, so we can try our best, but we really won't know until it's all over, or maybe never).  Good grief, another subject!  Well, the whole creation of written word's and their influence on society has gotten to me lately.  But I don't feel like going into the whole discussion right now.  Just think about storytelling and stories as an oral tradition, and then think what happens when it becomes written, reproduced, and when that starts to gain meaning and truth, how suddenly material that was important yet changeable becomes set in stone and rigid...

      Decided to pass time with a silly quiz to test how you use your brain.  Here's what it said:  You are somewhat left-hemisphere dominant with a balanced preference for auditory and visual inputs. Because of your "centrist" tendencies, the distinctions between various types of brain usage are somewhat blurred.   Your tendency to be organized and logical and attend to details is reasonably well-established which should afford you success regardless of your chosen field of endeavor, unless it requires total spontaneity and ability to improvise, your weaker traits. However, you are far from rigid or overcontrolled. You possess a degree of individuality, perceptiveness, and trust in your intuition to function at much more sophisticated levels than most.   Having given sufficient attention to detail, you can readily perceive the larger aspects and implications of a situation or of learning. You are functional and practical, but can blend abstraction and theory into your framework readily.   The equivalence of your auditory and visual learning orientation gives you two equally effective sensory input systems, each with distinctive features. You can process both unidimensionally and multidimen- sionally with equal facility. When needed, you sequence material while at other times you "intake it all" and store it for processing later.   Your natural ability to use your senses is also synthesized in your way of learning. You can be reflective in your approach, absorbing material in a non-aggressive manner, and at other times voracious in seeking out stimulation and experience.   Overall you tend to be somewhat more critical of yourself than is necessary and avoid enjoying life too much because of a sense of duty. You feel somewhat constrained and tend to sometimes restrict your expressiveness. In any given situation, you will opt for the rational, and learning of almost any type should be easy for you. You might need certain ideas explained to you in order to fit them into your scheme of things, but you're at least open to that!    urlLink Click here  to take the test yourself…although when I ran it it was way too slow.  Passed the time away however.  It gives you percentages, although mine only came out to 99%.  Guess it's a margin of error.  It's funny really, considering my love of improv.  But then again, I've always been fascinated by what I don't understand, and I guess that would explain improv: it's so different from how my brain works, it's just a thrill.  This also explains why I'm slow as an old sleeping ox in scenes.

      Ah, how nice to have a lovely weekend behind to make the day seem more pleasant.    I spent most of Saturday doing absouletly nothing in particular, reading, watching movies, cooking, cleaning, and otherwise lounging around and listening to the storms pass through.  And what a lovely sound they make indeed.  Sunday should have been renamed windsday, as the whole town seemed ready to topple over.  Simply amazing.  It must have been near 70, but with the gusts it felt more like 60.  I ended up outside almost all day, watching flags fly and change directions as the wind swirled about, and hearing kids yell when a big wind came through as they felt themselves being pushed around the hill.  People were out flying kites too, another point of amusement.  It was so lovely just to sit in the sun and wind and lounge around in the grass all day.  Being stuck in offices just isn't conducive to a sound mind. The outdoors and good ol' sun is always a quick refresher.    It looks like a group of us will try to start up a troupe or at least put on a show: sketch, improv, and stand up.  That should be entertaining.  It's really quite exciting, to get to go do something in front of an audience, haha! Although that bug should be taken care of in a bit by another show coming up this month. Wish us luck. We don't even know who will be in it or rehearsals, but we have a good pool to pull from.  Hopefully I can find my funny.  It seems to have run off now that I'm in the real world and you have to be conscience of what you say in public.   Nothing like constant self-editing to numb the brain.  But yes, the new show is quite exciting, and we've got someone working on a location for us.  Off to the park.

      Well isn't  urlLink this  grand? Let me see here, scars for life...and yet if they allowed the accused to testify why they did it, about the utter hopelessness and disillusionment of life, the poverty and misery that expands, the injustice, suddenly we would all be staring back at that woman and saying "So all you got were a few scars? You're lucky."  Listen, I'm not advocating this stuff, it's wrong to injure others, especially when they're just living their own life and not purposefully trying to harm, but people need to realize to solve problems, you need to recognize the issue.  Look at why people do what they do, the motivation, the conditions which lead to such acts.  You can't then go in and terrorize to try to shut them up, and you can't go in and brainwash people into thinking everything's ok.  You actually need to treat the problem.  All we ever do is treat symptoms.    Think of it like this: A man crawls in and says he cabn't feel his legs.  The doctor's tell him the see no problem, he made it to the clinic on his own.  He continues tio complain, so they create a harness for him to pull himself with.  Finally they start tapping on the legs, chop one of them off even. Still says he can't feel his legs.  They completely ignore the bullet wound on his belly and never even think of looking for the bullet loged in his spine.    Oh, that's a bit long and weird; short version: You get a bacterial infection.  They treat the headache, the nauseau, the diarrhea.  They don't give you antibiotics for the infection, which would stop all the symptons. Duh.

      Requiem is playing on NPR, never mind, it was something else, but it was nice.  I just got back from work. Good grief is it busy! I still haven't finished either of my presentations for the meeting. Handouts and kits are coming along quite well. The only aggravation is discovering 30 plus press regularly attended the AM in past years. I average 10 in house. Fuck.  Something to work on, definitely.  I originally meant to come say how nice the air is, but I feel I'm using too much passive voice in this whole damn thing.  I shouldn't be here anyway, I need to go pack, do laundry and dry it and pack it too, and then pack some more. Oh, and clean, and water plants. Damn. Why am I leaving tomorrow? Oh yeah, I'd be like this if it was a day later too.  Fart. Dash it all. Humbug.  OK, must go.

      So what are our priorities people? Take over nations who are in horrible condition due to sanctions created by us and under authoritarian rule, but leave countries where massive killings go on daily and children are soldiers fighting for their very survival alone? Oh wait, we don't know if we could win here.  And what's in it for us? Good PR? So much for this nation caring about its soul.  If there is a heaven and hell for countries, the US is sending itself into the depths of the Malebolge, maybe even to the feet of the dark prince himself.  A friend of mine said he's ashamed at our reaction, just sending a boat of Marines over and then waiting off shore while even the aid workers are dying of cholera and starving.  We let Rwanda destroy itself, we've allowed countless other battles to ensue throughout the Congo.  And we invaded Iraq for humanitarian reasons? Iraq was a freakin' garden of eden compared to this. Humanitarian reasons my ass.  I hope you appreciate the rotting stench of the bodies which are being layed out before you, their blood is on all of our hands.

      I just read the most  urlLink depressing  article ever.  New happiness equals new sorrow. Sometimes I hate feeling so much, but this is a full feeling, not the depleted emptiness of the past.  A man's mother killed herself, so did his brothers and sister, and his father, all at different times, for different reasons. He's the only one left.  Makes me worry about home, but we have to soldier on don't we? Let life take its course, the twist and turns, deal with them as they come and don't fear for the future. I'll keep an eye out, and an ear, so I'm not shocked or overwhelmed by it all, but I can't drown in the possibilities either.  Such a bummer. Must get back to work.  The world is caving in on itself. I know this isn't true, it's always like this, always has been, we've just been sheltered from the chaos. Go to  urlLink BBC  or  urlLink CNN .  I'm getting nauseous from all this.

      Had a fabulous morning and early afternoon at the sculpture garden. Did nothing for 5 hours, and it was grand. That's two vacations this weekend! I also had a foray into PG county, which turned out wonderful (not that kind of wonderful, sheesh). Makes me want to start sprinting again, aka running randomly in the streets. Now I know how to work that set of muscles that have been weak for the past few years!  A big yipee to finding cool people that are totally different from any of your previous friends, and see you as equally bizarre. Who knew what I and most of the south consider "normal behavior" to be odd to others...it's so much fun to get reactions off of that.

      Ah ha! Yes, now this is what I'm looking for.  Good friends. Good insults. Yeah.  Up until two this morning eating at the diner after a visit to a comedy show in the Cleveland Park area.  And more hang out time to come. Yes, I am the ultimate dork. But I'm a happy dork!  Ooh, ooh, gathered more bits and pieces of the giant puzzle I'm trying to put together, soon I'll have some idea of what the picture looks like! Yay!  Any grand thoughts on society, current events, news? I'm trying to ignore all that, while enjoying the fact that this country has never had the stomach for being an outright colonizer.  We like to subvert and control, oh yes, and not let go, but to be as obvious as Iraq? Nah uh.    Heh, and we now have blame going around about that statement.  Damage control is finally failing; saying it does not make it so.  One dissapointment: how slow we are with world news.  Actually, a lot of news is recycled, and not just in the, "well isn't this interesting" or "here's a study" sector. The Brits had an inquiry about this info months ago, before the war even if I remember correctly. And now it's "news" here in the states.  Just follow the news for a couple of years, especially bits made for national and local audiences, and you'll see the cycle.  So much for trend setting.

      Full moon came through, and seems to have cleansed me back to my usual timid self.  Kinda dissapointing, but more repectable.  I guess that's a good thing.   Very tired after a weekend of guests and running about, and now tons to do here.

      Listening to Cold Play - so lovely and melodic - and surfing for concerts.  Should I be working more? Yes, and I'm about to get back on track.  I just needed some space to detox my brain from the soda this AM.  It's been maiking me crazy like a teenage girl, and just about as immature and stupid too.  Too hard to focus on any one tihng, or anything that takes thought...  Just got an email for operations team, yet I'm already on the development team...hmm, should I play for more than one team?  I don't know, hehe.    Finally heard from one of my relatives, so nice to know she's still alive.  Ah, didn't mention on Monday Biochem (no not the one in Boston) called me a "senior operative," like I work for the CIA or something.  It's such a great label.  Comedy show last night, not improv, Tony Woods performed, slow late evening, and really tough crowd.  The one highlight was preshow hanging out, which is the main reason I attend these things anyway, to chat and talk and interact with people.  I found out there was some hanging out going on Monday after class that I missed, which is annoying, but I'll offer up my place for drinks so people can chill for free next week.  A nice offering, and something I was planning earlier.    Random thought about roofs (rooves? Gosh, it's been a while), but I'll keep that to myself and just post here to annoy you :-)  Today's mantra: "I'm going back to the start..."

      Wow, we have cool classmates! I even get to play with some old friends that I've hung with but not performed with before, and Mr. R is trying to get into class, a bit late, but we'll see.  Ok let me explain this system of dragon, it's a strong personality person in your life who can motivate you, usually by their own actions and behavior.  They're unpredictable until you get to know them, and very bold, someone who can help and protect you or eat you alive, depending on what side of them you land.  Very good class vibes, although once again suffering from brain freeze up there, must drink coke or something to release the trappings of my mind. Everyone's very cool, and a bunch of people I know and some fun new ones are in the other Monday class, so more playmates, yay! We'll have to have a post class party at some point for all who want to come drink my liquor! Good scenes folk, good scenes!

      So for those who read the earlier post from last night, just attribute it to stress for work today.  All will be well.  And I've found my dragon, an odd concept, but after reading  The Clearing  by Alan Arkin, where there's a whole bit about finding one's lion, such a concept has entered my brain.  Thing is, the dragon's actually a person in your life, as opposed to some internal identity thing.  Very excited.

      Let's back track reverse here: Waited forever for the bus, but now am home.  Saw finding Nemo, which I was dissappointed with, I think from all the hype it got, or maybe seeing the reminders of why I disliked the fishing industry and what's wrong with the world perturbed me too much to be able to sit back and relax like one should for a cartoon.  Made me feel like first time I saw LOTR and ended up playing a game with the movie instead of following the plot (I've since lowered my expectations, and it's actually really good).  Bought stuff with my gift card at Urban Outfitters, which is good considering I can't spend any money right now (yet i ride bus, go to movie, etc, need to cut more). Animation was excellent.    Last night, yipee! On the roof, oh my goodness, fabulous.  People loved the roof and were similarly amazed at the view I have here.  The people gathered from the building were so diverse, it was wonderful, and someone brought up a stereo and played the station with the orchestra from down on the mall, so it was like being there with out all the grass stains, sweat and heatstroke! So many voices, sounds, phrases and faces from so many places, better than the five languages heard simultaneously on the PVTA.  People's reaction to the apartment were mixed.  Some of my friends were a bit quiet, no good conversationalists until the improvisers arrived, which was frustrating, as I was hoping for a livelier evening, or at least for it to start before the fireworks.  Some people thought it was interesting, others liked it.  I've been worried because it is so me, and allowing people in is a bit worrisome, yet it's so not me because it's muted, the modern aspect is missing, as well as a lot of the boldness and eccentricities of my earlier places.  I need the stars, and to figure how to exist as an adult with mature tastes that still express me.  BEFORE I FORGET!! -  Does anyone know about this? A piece of small notebook paper with a note on it...I don't know where it's from, although now I have a vague thought of someone handing me something and telling me to read it later, but it may just be a way of making connections to nothing.  Here's what it says:   "You all work so hard and get such high salaries - but just think of the rewards - you hope!?"  I don't think I wrote it, phrasing's off and handwriting's not familiar.

      OK, this is too perfect:  4) Lastly, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, please contact in person or by phone 5 friends or acquaintances that have expressed any interest in this. I know it sounds like a pain in the ass, but this is very effective.  I  have this theory. Many, many, more people want to have sex with you than you would imagine – it’s just that you never ask them.  ALSO:  MANY, MANY  more people want to take improv classes, they JUST NEED TO BE ASKED.                                      - From an email sent earlier today. Big grin

      Well, it wasn't the heat!  It was bad yogurt...no wonder I fell asleep thinking, "I've been poisoned," I had!  Working late today trying to get all this crud done.  Such a fool about it all, but spastic active mode's back in gear, so whatever dude, as long as my ass keeps kickin and the boat keeps rockin, we'll have ourselves on damn fine meeting.  Invited people over for the 4th of July -now i realize I've jst set up my first aprty at my apt! Eek...hehe, shows what thinking at midnight can do for you.  It's sarting to get dark, so I better be on my way home and pick up some supplies.

      I just asked myself why I don't have any self confidence.  What did self think? After hemming and hawing about goodness knows what, here's the deal: trust. Self doesn't trust self, and I know why. Too many false hopes, too many misperceptions of the world and where we are in relation to it. I have the innocence of a child yet the mind of the adult, and no matter how often I try to protect myself I always end up hurt. This means I should get over it and trust myself again, Say what I think when I think instead of editing constantly and thinking, "well, eventually I'll say," becuase eventually never comes. It's always tomorrow, as the saying goes. I can't hide. Ok, yes I can hide, but it's not effective. Sigh. I was very content earlier today.  I woke up feeling like it had been a really good night. That feeling after a few good drinks and a really deep sleep, the feeling from going to sleep in pain, feeling like there's no end, and waking to peace. Contentment. It's just the sudafed talking, but it feels so good to be content, to walk in cool fall air (the air below my home and north of it is muggy, but on this hill, it's cool. I love it, like God decided to give someone a perfect day).  The actual evening was reserved, me keeping my mouth shut and being a bit anti-social and tired while hanging with a group of people for a friends birthday. It's rude to be moody around people, but for some reason I just settled into it and kept hanging with them.   You know what's odd? As entirely different as the birthday person and I are, I realize we're in the same boat: both trying to be social and play yet finding no one to come along.  I don't know if it's always been like that for him, but I know it's regular for me. Maybe that's why we come when we invite each other places, we know that feeling of rejection, and the feeling of joy that comes from having a friend come by. Therapy time eh? Welcome :)  Oh, sidetracked there, last night, over the weekend, was a not so helpful guest this time, didn't help out as well for the show, was late even showing up, did the work, but then ran off to join the posse again, sucked at pool, just really not-so-social, oh, rode in car with wind in hair, cig smoke all afternoon, and music blasting out of the car, Riding through NE like that at night took me somewhere, another city, was good. I was in my own world, but they understand, they have their weirdness too, and I do trust them enough to be like that in front of them. We all have our moments. And I was an anonymous rock star :) See, I do good even when I'm foul.

      Good grief, I'm glad I decided not to drink last night. We turned away 20 people, 15 of who had made reservations. The thing is, people call DCAC, leave a message for tickets, and then show up. Well, guess what? It's an answering machine, not an automated system that stops reservations at a certain point and tells others to come by at 7:45 and take their chances. Some people do not understand this, and poor Pete, who worked that night and myself got the brunt of one couple's anger.  I do not liked being yelled at, but on the positive side, I didn't cry. I almost started and then thought, I don't want to give her the satisfaction. I don't do well with yelling, it can make me ill some times.  Yuck.  It was a stressful day from the start, so somehow I was ready for something like this.    I forgot about how that State Trooper handled the big E down in Georgia. Next time, I'll ask them to calm down, let them know I can't be talked to in that manner, and if they have something to say they can speak to me in a a more reserved voice. Then leave if they continue to yell.  Well, I apologized to them, but there's nothing we can do, it's sold out, been sold out since earlier in the week possibly, and then left to go film the show.  I really hate negative energy.   We're thinking about coupons for those turned away.  It would help to not allow walk-ins either if we're over-sold (but I think it's the policy of who we rent from to do such, they run the box office, we don't).  That's practically a full house turned away this weekend. We can only hope they will return.  It's just way more popular than expected, heck both shows (another group was doing live Rocky Horror) were over-sold throughout the run.  One class left,  then the showcase.  Let's make this non-spontaneous brain turn into a strong improv mind.

      Let's see what two rum&cokes and a big tequila shot can do for ya, huh? Hehe! OK, so not a huge amount, but consumed fairly quickly and with little food. Oh, how it's fun to manipuloate bodies :)  And I've seen a cool spit trick, really.  Very neat to watch him vreate these huge bubbles and fill the glass with tehm. Utter dorkness requires the desire to do tension tests on the strength of it! Hehe, molecules. Yeah, i don't remember much of the jargon. oh well.  Fun tiems, most definetly, found a bit of a nich hanging with spit dude and hercules et al. Fun :) ANd I walked back all by my itty bitty self, te he he, spekaing ryhming couplets with a British accent. Don't know why, but it just seemed right. Yes, like the guy from RPI goping british.  The presence of light however seems to send me back to Americanism. Such is life. Now, I'm sobering enough to be able to remove my contacgts with some sense. Alos going to look at Mars for a bit.  Yay. Good show tonight too! Awesome rubberband company and exploding arms, and crying lovers and Carnegies, hoo hah! Very, very tight work. Congrats! Turned away 10-14 people as well. MAKE RESERVATIONS  AND SHOW UP IN TIME

      After a nap on the carpet and a few chapters of Animal Farm, I'm off to watch the Disney Robin Hood in espanol.  I also have Alicia en el Pais del Maravillas.  Dunno why, just to help me keep up with Spanish or something.  I love this movie, it was one of my favorites growing up along with Dark Crytal and the Rats of Nimh.  The latter two haven't survived the passage of time though, Nimh being nowhere near as good as the book, and Crystal now too bizarre for me.  WIT's shows are up and running again, and have been selling out like crazy. Excellent. Yes, the show and the situation of selling out.  GO to  urlLink DCWIT  for deets.  I also heard Katie on the radio today talking about some classic improv, great she's out and about again and that she's doing shows this run. Muy excelente.  Also cooking again, bought lots of meat and dairy, and should have some good food for the week and not be lazy enough to end up buying meals like last time.  Ok, off to see the video.

      Chomsky piece, Power and Terror, really nice.  Like sitting through a bunch of lectures, but all compacted and no weird crowds to hang around.  Sorta.  Gives the brain good stimulation, yet we all know the people attending and listening, the majority at least, already know and/or believe him, so he's preaching to the converted.  I really should go find some counter arguments to listen to, so I can appreciate the differnt takes on how the world is and why it is.  I think I agree with all that was said in the film though, but it was a lot to take in.  Very good.  Had an attendance of five from my group, so that was nice, more than just the usual duo or threesome, but of course divided my attention. Anyway, must get off and back to other things.  I hear there are plans afoot, of which I'm hearing only accidentily.  Don't want to get pulled into something just b/c I'm there again.  If they really want and/or need me, they know where to find me.

      Well, I could cycle the same story again, but no bother. Back in town, back to work, back to the daily stuff that needs to be dealt with.  Class was good, although my ass is still too f'in timid.  Once people got warmed up, transitions were pretty nice, and some of those scenes were hysterical.  I like the Armando a bit more than the Harold currently, the looser structure makes you not worry so much about what needs to be done, much more in the moment.  Personal whine time: Such dumb behavior, must modify it (it's kinda like the rip currents just under the surface of the ocean, I need to become the gulf stream or something noticeable).  I think it is all these bizarre anxieties, although despite the cuteness of the little round thing in the zoloft ad, I don't want to resort to drugs and serotonin inhibitors to change who I am.  Ya know what would be great?  Figuring out the triggers for my confident self and then kicking those in whenever I start to get shy.  I'll start looking into that.  Still out searching...prospects have dwindled from a few to none suddenly, which is very frustrating and just makes the need that much stronger.  Must actively scout for a bit and see who I can find.  Oh, and there are several people who deserve a phone call.  It's been too long since I've chatted with my friends.

      Such a nice thing to say, "why hasn't anyone snatched you up yet?" That's just made my day.  I wonder myself, or maybe I don't.  Guess I'm not out in the market enough or something, or is it too many walls of protection? Probably a bit of both, and a lot of the really slow on the uptake.  I don't pick up on hints, and when I do, figure nah, I'm misreading this, they're not interested. Maybe most people just don't know me, it takes time, and the perception they do have just isn't appealing. I'll find somebody though.  It'd be nice to have someone around. Yup, I'm on the prowl for a man, and it's not even hunting season.   ...meeting update: almost done, yahoo! Find me and bug me about deets about all the mini adventures.  I will say this, we found the best little bar I've ever seen, and I can only hope there's something comparable in the Washington area.  It's called BarBar, has two bars, two pool tables,and lots of open seating at tables and benches and couches.  Very open even though it's in a basement, and not cramped and crowded like throngs of folk in a 10ft wide room.  They have board games, yes, board games...we played pictionary until 11:30 at night and had a blast.  My team won, with the other group coming up fast behind us.  We kept rolling 2's and 3's while they'd get 4's and 5's, but justice prevailed :) and the smart folks won.  Each team had a Burmese guy on it, so we had a few "new card" incidents with that.  Some of those phrases, well, they're not familiar.  But we only had that happen about three times during the entire game.  Booze, drawing, and shouting make for a happy crowd.

      Well, it's finished, presentation complete.  I only had a minor melt down yesterday afternoon in which the entire world was collapsing in on itself and I was the sole reason for all the misery and complete failures of society, so score one for me.  Based on those hysterics, and the blahness of the entire past year though, I'm actually going to go get help.  I talked with my mom, and that's what she thinks is best, and considering she's got experience with this stuff, it means I really need help.  I can't explain how strange it is to be simultansuosyl happy and content and absolutetly miserable, and in that misery know it's all completely irrational.    One note of beauty in all this, in the presentation which was chaotic and a bit, well, you knew I didn't prep much for this thing, but the pieces I wrote, my words and thoughts, when I started speaking them and not the tidbits of notes, you should have heard it, like a melody floating across the room, so inspired and true.  If I actually write my speeches and talks, they'll be wonderful, I just need to sit down and do that.    Improv is also looking up.  Since I have been depressed or anxious or whatever it is that's wrong with me practically since I graduated, the issues I ahve with classes and all are stemming from this thing.  I described it earlier as a monkey sitting on my shoulder and biting my ear, and well, that's what it is.  Not a monkey on my back, annoying, but something painful. And the sooner I can pull the m.f. off and bash it to the ground and burn it's little dead monkey body into a pile of ashes and scatter it across the sea, the better and freer and happier I will be.

      Woah, so I'm totally visible here, window on the side looks into a service hall, so if people aren't in the room watching, then they can see me from there. Dang, no procrastination this week.  Well, it will be busy with the meeting and presentations. Not that I'm in a worse situation than anyone, I just like to vent, that's all.  The city is lovely, and hopefully I'll see more before the week is out. No break today though, so we'll see how lunch manifests itself.  Ferry boat ride here is fun, this AM the water was so still and the sun was rising over the island. Beautiful.  Still got my brain wrapped around a particular person, and I'm getting annoyed at this, so maybe I'll drop it soon and move on.  That would be nice. But oh, how the interesting always find a way to pull you back.    Scatterbrained.  My new knickname for the week. Or maybe the year.

      Weekend done. I had a couple of college buds in town this weekend and managed to keep them entertained. Of course, I took who I could to see WIT shows, and we lucked out Saturday night when some of my teachers were in the show (I talk to people about people in my life as if everyone knew who they were, so now they have some faces to help them figure who I'm talking about). Ducky just made her way out early this AM thanks to Amtrak and a cab to BWI. Listen, teh airport's cheaper, but for some locations, you spend as much time getting to your destination as you do flying.  Sirens...VP's on his way to work. It's cold too. I'll fill in more later.   Quick rundown: Homemade dinner, drinks with friends, WIT show, slurpees on the roof, sleeping late, dinner party at another friends, second WIT show, walk through a park, wandering, chatting, bonding, American Splendor (excellent), nice company

      I'm watching a PBS piece called Race, focusing on Native Americans and Hawi'ins.  If I could figure out how to do it, I'd get into social justice law and reinstate the contracts this country made with all the different nations we've fucked over in this land.  Ethnic cultural cleansing after we wiped out who we could. Lovely isn't it to recognize your past as nothing more than an earlier version of so many other attrocities played out before then in other places and time and played out more recently by South Africa, Germany, Japan, Turkey, Rwanda, and the former Yougoslav republic, just to name a few.  I should just accept being a priveleged white and ignore all the people living in poverty in this country, but then I'd be giving up my soul. God gave each of us one for a reason, and I'd suggest using the eyes brain GOd gave you and whatever other senses you have and wake the freak up to the world and believe in the humanity of yourself and everyone around you. Feel, live, breathe, and embrace. Protect.

      Our company president took us out for lunch today for a swanky meal. Yum. Four courses, all delicious. We spotted some cameras halfway through the meal, small handhelds and a bunch of people standing around. They were filming a scene for K Street, that new HBO serial about a Washington lobbying firm.  We ate in a happenin' joint, much fancier than anything we normally would try. Even better, I don't know what it cost. Hehe. We ran into Steven Soderbergh on the way out.  Not sure who anyone else was, but that's OK. We don't want to seem like a bunch of star-struck east coasters.

      I love Johnny Cash. I'm probably blasting the neighbors out ride now, but they should appreciate the sentiment.  When the man comes around  is beautiful. It does change the soul to hear him. God you have to love good music. It's so powerful, like bringing you to God or as close as you can get. Someone told me about radical amazement; essentially finding God in certain events and situations, etc. Listening to Cash is radical amazement, as powerful as a perfect breeze blowing across your shoulders in the summertime or the breathe of fall in the September air.  There is such perfection in this world when you ignore the rest of it. Too bad we can't make it all perfect. But then we'd be jaded by it all, wouldn't we?  A quick list of amazing people: three. That's how many people have truly impressed me thus far and can truly be called individuals. There are people who are talented, funny, cute, sweet, lovable, adoring, or fantastic, but only three who reach the upper eschelons of existence in my mind. Two women and one man. If I can now find radical amazement in a lover, I will be set for life. Wish me luck.

      Since the Kennedy-Nixon debate, the visual appearance of candidates has played a major role in election victories. Unsure of this? The ugly candidates don’t win.  There’s been an argument that with radio, different people win debates than when on television. This could be a reflection of behaviors and body language as well.  But wouldn’t it be interesting to hold a full debate in animation?  Use stick figures, and animate them with to be identical accept for a letter on a shirt. Then have people choose who they thought was the best, and see who wins the debate.  To make it a true experiment, we’d have to have another group watch the debate on television, and see their reactions as well. It would be strange if there was a significant difference in people’s responses. Oh, even better, use different voices as well, just have the same words and intonations, so we don’t know who is who.  A bit like which soda do you prefer. I’m merely trying to point out how perceptions influence our judgment, and that maybe we’d take someone else for our leader if we actually paid attention to what and how they thought, and not all the other outside appearances. Yes, there is some validity to these judgments; someone with great ideas but poor body language would not be persuasive enough in person to deal with other world leaders.  But I’d like to see that really good person end up in some advisory postion to whoever does become elected. Know what else is tons of fun?  Using voting numbers for both president and vice president: whoever gets the most is pres, and the second vote getter is the vice president. Talk about tension in the work place!   Anyway, just thoughts.  Also, Softball with improvisers rocks. The support and competitive edge mix perfectly.  It's nice to be able to get up there and play, even when the last time you held a bat was 1994.  We didn't have a proper game this week, too few people, but we did get some practice time in.  Come out and watch WIT people in sports action Sunday afternoons on the Mall.

      Travel plans: off to NYC next weekend! Yay :-). I took way too long to get my booty back up there and visit. Too much southern travel I guess. Funny, now that fall's on it's way I'm heading north for my adventures (Mass. is the plan for October and November). Yay vacations!    Living in a world of joy and sorrow and anxiety. Joy when I'm with friends, sorrow when I'm alone and anxiety in and out of the day. I did locate some docs in my insurance plan nearby, from generalists to specialists, all under one roof.  Great.  Just need to make step two and call and get an appointment. I think it's been a couple of years since my last regular check up. And maybe they can recommend someone to talk to.  I'd like to spend more of my life enjoying it while it's good instead of fighting back the misery that hides just over my shoulder, waiting to swoop in whenever I'm on my own.  Brains can suck sometimes.

      Another weekend down, more plans in the works.  We're trying to organize some jams so we can have playtime in between class sessions, and it looks like a few of us will get together, at least.  Maybe I'll try posting a day and time and having a plan and just see who shows up...hmmm.   Meeting more people; up to see a movie tonight, and then making cookies with a college friend tomorrow.  Two weekends till another bud comes into town!   Over the weekend, saw the opening game of Panthers and Jacksonville, at the stadium, and man it was fantastic. OK, well, I wanted to leave around halftime it was so bad, but they came out roaring in the second half and made the trip well worth the effort.  Yeah, got to see family and all, but I was just down there a month ago, so while pleasant, it wasn't a highlight.  Also saw Italian Job, OK, but Transporter was more fun for chase scenes and driving.  Been catching flix on DVD as well, not much good really, so back to the pot to gather the next batch.  I'll save regular societal and political rants for tomorrow.

      Good grief y'all, don't you know anything? This sounds like...woah, low hit below the belt by Lieberman at Dean, although Dean's sounding a little too humanistic, crazy shit...anyway, overall it's so freakin dull, they keep saying how shitty Bish is, rehashing and rehashing the rehashing of what's already happened...come on, tell us what you will do..they seem to have ideas for the economy, but not for Iraq, come up with a plan, have an idea, and stop the roundtable rhetoric. They need to prove themselves isntead of giving us a history lesson of the last fe years, we've been here and we know! Nobody stands out, everyone has mistakes. Bush is crap, but they aren't making any reasonable sense either... Good slam by Kerry on being able to find the rest of the states in this hemisphere, he'll get the nomination.  Dean's too far left for the country and too idealistic. Other's are too inexperienced, heck Kucinich and Braun sound good even in comparison, the woman knows her stuff, too bad she doesn't have a shot. Maybe she'll get into a cabinet position.  OK, back to paying attention to PBS's democratic party ad. The Republicans don't have much to worry about. Worried about other people's living conditions? Honey, everything would cost out because of higher salaries and people would lose jobs...it's a strange place and not an easy solution. You can dream of marshmallows and bunnies, but that won't solve the world's problems.

      We had our showcase last night, and man, if you're going to only have one really good class, do it in front of an audience!  We performed at the DCAC of all places, as the church where we play normally has no a/c in the room with a stage. Family and friends watched, as well as some other improvisers from WIT mainstage and Jackie. Who was the most excited by the show, besides the performers? The other improvisers in the audience. It's exciting to wow anyone, but especially people who appreciate the craft! A full Harold and a full Armando, and as usual, the Armando was our strongsuit.  Lovely. We finally got the transitions down and the time and character moves that we didn't muster in early runs of the harolds.  We let go and had fun.  I can't even remember most of the scenes or characters, but I do remember the audience's faces and the performer's faces, and we all were smiling.  Let's see what I can muster here:  First, we had our own program, courtesy of one of our talented classmates, explaining the structures and had a pic of each of us.  The Harold's three stories were the alcoholic parents with geeky kids, peodophiles anonymous, and DJ curry the in-demand-sucky immigrant.  The Armando started with Burrito, and had some great scenes with tacobell 102, 4chairs.com, No straights in the bath house, Ouija board for a husband, In the dark, Group exorcism, Practical killer nurses, ethic baby sperm donors, Grandma's egg hunt for quarters, the voices of the saints, cat people, Santa and Jesus and the Spice girl...I can't remember any more right now. If something pops up I'll add it in here, FYI.  We closed the show, lined up, and did our bow, then MC came down and talked about classes and shows and encouraged people to come.  GD ran off to get the flowers, delivered them to him, then one began to bow and we all bowed to MC, on the floor and on our hands and knees as if he were some sort of god, of course he was even higher after that!  Such support, no matter what you did you were safe and accepted. We played to each other's strengths and it was one giant group orgy :-)

      I’m not normal, at all, here’s what I’ve found funny in recent days: - The BBC site had a picture of one of the homes burning, a perfect picture window except for the furniture burning inside. The caption said something about firefighters say they almost have the fires under control.  - Watching Watership Down for the first time, we all freaked a few times. But there was hysterical laughter at the giant evil one-eyed bunny’s death charge for the other bunny. It was classic one-frame kung-fu fighting, and so cheesy. We all expected it to happen like that, and that’s why we laughed. The bunnies have claws as big as the cats for goodness sakes! - The audience’s interpretation of the gull’s voice for dating was also hysterical. - They showed a clip on the Today show of a reporter covering the fires when suddenly they say run, run and the place starts to burn, then they cut to an interview where the guy’s crying, and they show a shot of the news van he tried to start, absolutely gone. He had good reason to cry. But I started laughing at the irony he almost got killed by what he was covering. How many times to these guys get themselves into dangerous situations and then say the dumbest things…it just seemed appropriate that he’d get the scare of his life.  Poetic justice it seems, since he’s annoying, not dangerous, he should be scared, not killed. Yes, that is a bit funny. I wouldn’t have laughed if anyone got hurt. I’m not evil.

      I have soup and a fruit cup for lunch today. I’m so excited! It’s homemade, with veggies and a clear broth that formed when I boiled greens the other night. It’s really quite good, and since most of the nutrients end up in the water when you boil veggies, why not make a meal and get your full nutrition?  Sunday was not so great a day, as I had to leave class early due to a headache and just feeling awful. I walked back in the rain, a downpour that flooded the streets. And despite my umbrella, my feet and legs were soaked, as well as me left jacket sleeve.  A came home, cooled off, for it’s been muggy for quite a bit, and had a better dinner, soup, and went to bed feeling much better.  Saturday walked around in a garden instead of hiking, but still very nice to chat with friends and watch bugs run around flowers. I love the outdoors.  Friday, well very fun, very bored and wanting to go home, and then very fun again. It’s nice to be needed, or at least have people want you around, even if it’s for the group to be blah together.  Groups are such funny things, and people are even funnier. I like people too, but only some of them.  Politico world: Rally people, why the “end the occupation” stance? I thought you were humanitarians? Maybe I assumed incorrectly. We fucked up, and now we have to clean up the mess we made. If we leave now, it’ll be worse. At least most of the violence is aimed at us.  Money for schools and not for occupation…so it’s ok for Iraqis to die, starve, not have adequate medical facilities or infrastructure, but we better have books damn it! It’s not like we spend more per student than any other nation and still don’t see results is it? There wouldn’t be a study out there somewhere about that (this is where I wish I had the link).  I won’t delve into all the counter arguments, other places who need assistance more than Iraq, etc. I’m just asking, how is one life more valuable than another? If you can figure out a way and still believe yourself a humanitarian, then you can take the US out of Iraq. There ain’t no other nation willing to step into that quagmire, so don’t keep hoping for international cooperation. They’d occupy and exploit too. Don’t fool yourself.  Go read about ant society.

      Whahoo!  Yes, fun, finally!  The KC gang and some other accomplices hung out at one of those Dean meetups drinking and keeping to ourselves, and you know what? It was damn fun. My goodness I haven't had that much fun in ages (or at least here in teh district...MA compares, but I'm excited to finally find this level of enjoyment this far south). Heck, I haven't ahd that much to drink in that time span either. I love a slight stumble in the walk. I just hope it doesn't look too stupid.  Eh, who am I kidding, I like a buzz when I'm with the right people. Good grief, they're all crazy! And five years old! Big grin.  Later... I just saw the scariest thing ever…chocolate covered potato chips!  I know, there are fried Twinkies and Oreos out there, but I have yet to see them in person. This was frightening enough with the grease sealed inside. Yech.  In the political spectrum: I will lead with integrity so that while there may be debate about some of my actions, there will never be distrust in any of my motives.  My only interest will be the nation's interest.  That's my promise, so help me God.   -- Joe Lieberman  This just hit me funny. Leading with integrity. What’s more sad is Dogs for Lieberman. It was cute when Dean did it, he’s kinda silly, but a dog named Fenway? Come on! Casey the terrier can even smell that copy cat. And at least the other photos have the critters with logos and such. These are just people and their pets (I won’t even deal with the fact that not only can these creatures not vote, but do they even think about presidential candidates?)  John Edwards slogan:  urlLink Real solutions for America  And to view his blog you need to log in? OK, not really, but it sits up there staring at you. The page I see is the blog, but I’ll be darned if I’m logging in.  Sad state of affairs when the links on the “x for Edwards" is shorter than the average entry.   urlLink Gephardt's  page actually seems decent and comparable to Dean's, although I don't know if his crowd finds it as useful.   I still like Braun's sense, although I'll wait for the next debate to figure out if she's still doing her homework.  And don't get my started on Kerry. He and Dean are neck and neck because they're both becoming posers; Dean's modifying himself to appeal to a broader audience. He's not a sell out, but there's something a bit unsettling about him now. We all change though.

      Another odd dream, this time two characters found themselves trapped outside of this house, which wouldn't let them back in. This is after a caravan of different people park at the home and enter the house, which is so luxurious it even has it's own stores.  Eventually, the two outcasts find a real door, and have trouble convincing everyone they couldn't get back in. A number of years had passed by as well, although the two who remained outside had yet to age, and felt as if it had only been a few hours spent wandering the grounds.

      I dreamed this morning of my life being evaluated by one of the former dean’s of MHC. I kept trying to prepare and be ready, but missed my timeslot and had to meet her at another one, then was late for that one too. When we finally met, I apologized and started talking, then heard the wind and looked over to see a sign that the space was used on Thursdays for some parents meeting and looked in abject horror that the door was open, that anyone could come in. I thought , shit, I’m dreaming this for a reason and woke myself up and listened (for I must have heard someone in my apartment) and there was a sound. I opened my eyes and then closed them, debating whether to seem awake or asleep if someone really was in there. What the hell would I do. I should scream, if there’s anyone I see, or someone near me, scream as loud as I can. Finally I opened my eyes, but kept my body in a sleeping position and listened and looked, trying to determine if I heard breathing or the fan was making a sound. What was the rhythm. I heard other noises too, kept telling myself to scream if I saw anything, to be ready, don’t be silent, debated whether I could just scream anyway, too scare anybody off before I saw them. What if they went for me when I reached for the light? How would I get light on enough to scare someone? Finally I made a grab for the lamp and turned on the light and sat straight up in bed, looking around the room. Didn’t see anyone. Didn’t hear anything. I picked up my Nalgene bottle and walked to every nook and cranny, ready to slam someone in the head if they were hiding.  No one found. Doors still locked. It was the first time I’ve ever been scared on my own like this.

      I just spent 25 hours up straight through, followed by an hour of sleep, and I'm up and about again, wide awake. Amazing (I'm not one for all nighters). What kept me up? Some of those fabulous people form KC that I hang with. She talked for hours, we talked, and I've learned so much in that time. I waited patiently and the puzzle has finally come together, all the pieces in place. Thank you. For the answers as well as bringing these people into my life. They may be younger in years but they've lived so much more than I and have so much to teach me. If only they could have known Jeanie. I think they would have fought a lot, but they all would have had a good time.

      Hello to those who recently discovered my blog.   And to all you regulars, hey sexy. hehe.  Off to a play tonight, then a charity fundraiser party tomorrow, and time with some of my favorite people in the District.  Saturday looks to be outdoors hiking and Sunday an alum meeting and more football.  So busy!  Oh, and class starts Sunday night! How could I forget?  Sheesh, this is a busy weekend.  Now a moment to whine: Work junk is back, but I just need to get over this and focus in on projects and the fun aspects of the job (which are many, it’s just one hang-up or two that simply ruin my day and stress me out way more than they should). I still have this darn bruise near my rib, which keeps reminding me of its presence. Moment…done

      Fabulous time in South Hadley and Boston, got to see and hang with some of my bestest friends and even ran into some people I didn't think I'd run into (aka Katherine, Cassie and Jane C.).  I'll give  a full description later, but oh, how I miss you all!    I keep thinking I'm happy down here in DC, yet after this real vacation I realize I need more trees and close freinds near me. Ugh, to be real and comfortable and free again...I haven't been so silly or happy in ages.  Why can't you all come move closer :( I need my crack and fall foilage.  And no, I didn't know Jyot was going to be there! Call me you dork (not you, but Jyot)

      I love being high. No, not the drug-induced kind. The HAPPY kind. Good music, good work, fun projects, yeah. And it’s all spurred by the upcoming trip to Mass., The Panthers, Red Sox, Cubs, and Colts winning, Jane getting a job in DC, a cool one at that, Pan joining friendster and writing a kickass testimonial. Hell, hearing from Pan and seeing her picture made my day. Being reminded that Jane’s got a job helped to secure the high. And I’m out tonight with a boy, and maybe some other boys will come to visit/I’ll get to meet? Sheesh. Oh, and listening to Remember the Titans CD.  Update: I get a free class! It pays to work almost every weekend for two months and work your darndest to be all you can be…yippee! Come the next run of shows, I will have worked as an Assistant stage manager for one year.

       urlLink Terrorist Suspects' Names Reportedly on Disc    Reuters Friday, October 3, 2003; Page A12 (Washington Post)   Based on headlines and the stories in the news, sounds like this guy’s in trouble. Let’s give the benefit of the doubt here. He took the materials for work and didn’t sell them or show them to anyone else.  When asked what was on them, of course he said music. Why the heck would anyone say, “highly classified documents?” You don’t!  We’ll see what comes of all this.  A European country could be involved with this too. I doubt we’ve been sharing much, if anything.  Everyone, while they have the chance, should go read Animal Farm. It’s short, and you’ll understand why it’s especially useful this year. Pay attention to the announcements and press conferences about “the war on terror” and see how often the rules and results are rewritten.  Beautiful.  Life is all about how you perceive it.

      So this week has been "return of the anxiety monster" a B movie feature now showing in my head.  Very intense. Not wake-up-in-a-cold-sweat intense, but heart-pounding you're-whole-day-is-now-crap kinda intense. Monday night involved goblins that could enter by the presence of pieces of a broken pig statue that had fallen in the room, and unless all the parts were removed, teh goblins would be able to get in. Tuesday featured yours truly being pelted with crab-apple filled snowballs and trying to fight back fairly unsuccessfully. Wednesday night a big storm came through, huge winds blowing leaves down through the hills and the building we were in was about to be pelted with a huge tsunami. Amazingly a couple of friends and I rode out the wave in the lab after debating whether to go higher or lower (above or below the wave, we didn't want it to crash on us) and when it broke, we were a bit behind the brunt of it and swam where we hoped was up, following the force of the water as it pushed us through the ocean. We defeated the wave. I think this is a good sign.

      Pleasant time in Boston.   Just saw the Panthers fell apart, so not in a happy mood. Then there's work tomorrow. Why can't theater support itself better so those of us who enjoy it can go work and make a living at it like so many other careers?  Yes, there are jobs, good ones even, but it's a lot easier to run across something in an office cubicle than anything I'd like to do (and I ain't talking about acting either, although I'm sure actors wish work were easier to come by as well).  Agenda this afternoon: clean some more, try to de-clutter this joint. Eat dinner. Watch something amusing. Relax, relax, relax.  I so need a vacation.  I need trees.  I'm about certain running off to big cities for breaks defeats any attempt at "getting away" since really it's just too much city that creates the pressure.  Maybe that's why my stress levels were so far down back at college, cause there was more nature and I could deal with the world. Or something. Moods suck man.  I should take two weeks off and go commune with nature.

Don’t push your values on others, especially when it comes to basics such as food. Schmucks. What do you think they’ll do to the sheep now? Let theme run free? They’ll sell them elsewhere or just kill and toss them all. What a waste.  For those with  urlLink creative intentions . They mention there’s another ad contest out there, but of course fail to mention who. I’ll see what I can dig up.  I’m guessing Kerry or Clark.  Read articles and links on indiantimz.com on Dean. Once again his actions in Vermont clash with his current platforms. No surprise.  Anyone watch Clark last night? He’s on Letterman tonight. Good interview yesterday, still foreign policy focused, but he did get weepy-eyed in front of Dan Rather.  They mentioned Shelton’s comments about character flaws and early retirement. There’s something about him that if he managed to get the nomination, Bush would use to rip him to shreds. “It’s all gossip” Yeah, uh huh, He’s sounding like a stereotypical woman now. And don’t show me that man in Speedos! Eeek!  More chaos in the world. They’re showing how close they are, and what disasters await Greece in 2004.  There’s no amount of security Greece can put up to protect everyone involved with the Olympics.  They should order body bags now, before the price goes up.  And there’s the horrible reality of the mirroring of American TV shows that focused on secret spy/terrorist networks trying to attack various interests all around the world. Now we’re living it.

      Very scary material…read all of  urlLink this  and check back to vote. Haha.   He agreed to meet too. Poor thing, some of these women have such issues, you shouldn’t touch them with a 10 foot poll (Yeah, we all have issues, even the men folk, but we don’t go around trying to get a date or posting all our…hmm, with each thought and word, I see the irony of what I’m trying to say.  Well, how sad are they if I’m saying they’re sad!).  There are a couple of decent ones in there, plus some obvious jokes. You’ll gain great amusement from this, I promise.  Or maybe you’ll run screaming in fear.  For some fun:  urlLink pick your candidate    1. 	Your ideal theoretical candidate.   (100%)  Doesn't exist  2. 	Dean, Gov. Howard, VT - Democrat   (69%)  3. 	Edwards, Senator John, NC - Democrat   (67%)  4. 	Kucinich, Rep. Dennis, OH - Democrat   (58%)  5. 	Libertarian Candidate   (53%)  6. 	Gephardt, Rep. Dick, MO - Democrat   (49%)  7. 	Clark, Retired General Wesley K., AR - Democrat   (47%)  8. 	Kerry, Senator John, MA - Democrat   (44%)  9. 	Sharpton, Reverend Al - Democrat   (44%)  10. 	Lieberman, Senator Joe, CT - Democrat   (35%)  11. 	LaRouche, Lyndon H. Jr. - Democrat   (33%)  12. 	Bush, President George W. - Republican   (28%)  13. 	Phillips, Howard - Constitution   (17%)  14. 	Moseley-Braun, Former Senator Carol, IL - Democrat   (3%)  This is fascinating, from the same site as above, just a different test.  Similar to Quizilla in that you can waste hours of time.  Trying to find my religion: Unitarian Universalism (100%) the catch all of religions.  Doesn’t really count, so I should consider looking into Liberal Quakers (94%), then Reform Judaism (93%), Bahá'í Faith (88%), Neo-Pagan (80%) (doesn’t that jive), Sikhism (80%), or Orthodox Judaism (77%). I’m more Jewish than Christian, somehow, or I can reach closer to my roots with Mainline - Liberal Christian Protestants (75%).  Sheesh.    Other options: 9.  New Age (74%)  10.  Islam (70%)  11.  Jainism (67%)  12.  Mahayana Buddhism (63%)  13.  Secular Humanism (62%)  14.  Theravada Buddhism (60%)   More were listed, but all below 60% (they curve the test, so 100% is the best match, not 100% agreement). Lowest: Mormons (23%) and Jehovah's Witness (18%).

Watched Gephardt’s videos…nice. “Struggle” losses you at tne end with the gathering in his backyard, but I guess there’s evidence that those sorts of images feed into the subconscious.  I love watching background people’s faces when they’re thinking, “I’m on TV.”  Oh, and my two favorite candidates spoke at the 60th National Congress of American Indians Convention.  Clark produced a generic  urlLink speech  , flavored with a few spices of the audience he addressed.  Dean has a better grasp of the  urlLink issues  and actually promises sovereignty, which the US technically gave years ago, but we’ve never honored any of the treaties the US established with these nations.

      I'm just internet happy today, or not busy enough!  So how cool that Dean came through DC for a Birthday party of his?  urlLink Read  it here.    I went to watch the various tv ads candidates posted on their sites, and Kerry just looks miserable.  Edwards looks good, aside form a couple of cheesy ads, the nature of which Clark made fun of (or maybe these types of ads are regular, but I hadn't seen one before). It's the group style ad, where a candidate's in a cafe talking and everyone's listening and nodding, and at the end, they all clap. Cornball!  You can do a quick search and find the clips. Hopefully you have a fast connection.  OK, another outing, another group. Oh, coolio last night though!  I attended a lecture on criminal behavior with FBI folks, and on exiting one of the volunteers started chatting wiht me (guess tehre's a "I'm looking into a new career" look?) and made tons of suggestions. Sounds like he was well connected too. You never know who'll you run into in this town.  Plus, some guy from the lecture picked up on our conversation and suggested another lecture to attend.  Could be a connection, could be a stalker.    This recent trend of strangers talking to me and noticing me is quite bizarre.  I don't know if I'm walking straighter, not as moody, or what, but I'm kinda enjoying the attention.  It's still bizarre to me though.  Sad news: Braun's on her way out. Read the news stories. Once word gets out the'yre struggling/in debt, it's only a matter of days before the operation folds.

      My brain's wafting through the absolute ecstasy of caffeine, the Goldmember soundtrack, and knowing all too well the actions of other people. Instincts work when you trust them, so I could be really excited. Hell, the high of friends drive me to sheer bouts of giddiness, whether it's an email, a phone call, or actually being around them. If only everyone lived close enough we could just wander over to each other's homes whenever we get bored. That's the main thing I miss from college: wandering to visit and random activities all the time. You need more coordination in the real world, as well as transportation. Sheesh. I am hyper today, giddy even.  And this with no action too. Damn.

      At the risk of messing up, I'll remain vague: I really would like to expand and explore.  I'm just not as satisfied as I should be, and it's taking its toll. I need to find a spark, either there or in some newness.    That could apply to so many things, but I've got one particular in mind, and it's a subject that's rarely addressed here.  Yay for giant storms hitting both coasts and the mainland and England all in the same time frame.  Superstorms are on thier way!    Such joy exists in the ability of one to lay around on the floor listening to rain and classical music while the home is filled with smells of dinner and baking cake.    I was in a cafe the other day, listening to more good music, staring out the window, pondering winter and looking at the empty chair beside me, thinking how lovely it would be to share this moment with someone.  Relationship jones is back. I need someone good, and long term, but not the killer type (sometimes the most commited just don't understand no. I like my firends, and don't want any of them gone on account of a psycho stalker type. That just ruins shit).

      Man, talk about fun-filled weekends! We even made a new friend in the process, a scattered extrovert with a superb memory.  Whoo hoo.  Finally spent a night in and manged to cook a bit as well as make a couple of calls. I've got anotehr event to attend tonight, with a different crew.    We had a jam this weekend, went very well, lots of new people and a few vets, and everyone seemed to either enjoy themselves or appreciate the spirit of what happend. The event became a bit more class-like than inteneded, but I think everyone will start to take control once familiarity improves.  It's either recess or study hall, that's my philosophy on jams.  This was definitely study hall.  The older vets, who weren't aware of the jam, fussed about not being reminded, so I'll have to send them a special notice.  Sheesh :-)   Took the  urlLink politics  test: Economic Left/Right: -1.38 Libertarian/Authoritarian: -2.36    Tomboy    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Viewing the women for Clark page is awful, he’s a protector? What the fuck? A Visionary? Could we sound anymore mamsby pamsy? Sheesh!   Watched the SEIU announcement, with Dean present, where they said they haven’t made an official announcement until another large Union makes their decision next week.  This is very good news for Dean or Clark, I’m suspecting Dean, but I’d love for another powerful union to take Clark, and have it be Clark Vs. Dean and Kerry booted out of the race, then end with a D/C or C/D ticket. Although they’d probably kill each other.  Maybe Dean would take Edwards under his wing, and Clark would take Kerry. I suspect Kerry promised Edwards the VP spot ages ago though. We’ll see how things turn out.  I’m becoming one of those politicos here, attending events and meeting people and researching, eeek, am I that desperate to get back to school?  Well, I’m doing my part to stay informed.   This is from yesterday, but I forgot to move it to post: Who watched the Rock the Vote forum last night? You were a fool to miss it! Finally, an actual debate.  Tons of news stories out there.

      Yesterday morning woke up in a good mood. Really good mood. Very happy day.  People are good (when they're nice).  Class last night went OK. It's a bizarre rotation of folk though, as every week someone else finally shows and others are out. We worked on miming mostly and what all can come from there, which is a lot.  We've got some really good physical/creative people. I once again am limiting myself within preset rules of reality. Gotta get my brain out of that damn box (Hell it lives outside it most of the time anyway). Jam coming up this weekend.  First one in months. Yay for fresh blood!  Halloween? The night of resulted in me curling up on the couch at a party and trying not to fall asleep.  The night after was much better, bigger party, more people to talk to, less alkyhol in my system, so better morning.  Maybe it was my liver singing Hallelujah that made Sunday so grand. Or talking with good friends.  Grin and big stupid grin go here. Semi-bliss. Yes. Some people are good.

      After a successful holiday season and shopping, I get a call this afternoon from my mom saying that my sisters’ (half-sisters) mother passed away today. Two of the three were visitng her today, and the third is on her way down for the funeral. They’re all shaken up.  Send some comfort their way please, if you’re so inclined.  I know the day I get a call saying my mother’s dead they’ll have to lock me up for awhile. That’s the trouble of being close to someone; there’s so much more pain.  Last minute I decided to host a new year’s party. Most people already have plans, and I really don’t expect many to show. The foolish thing however, is I sent out an Evite, so now everyone can see how unpopular I am (or how very popular and busy my friends are).  Smart.  Lost in Translation: good film, quiet, calming. To Be and to Have, a French documentary about a small rural school, should also be added to your list, although it will be hard to find.  Slow too, but reminds you of simpler times. Excellent study of human relations.  Improv update too: packed house at 7:30 and a decent audience (though sold out on paper) at 10.  One weekend left.  The articles in the Thursday Style section of the Washington Post (p C5) and the Weekend section (p 24) on Friday gave us great publicity. Lots of out of town visitors and an entirely different demographic watching the show. Overheard good things as people left, and talked with some great people before the show, including a 90 year old woman who has a daughter or granddaughter at Second City.

      Chaos ensued last night walking home.  I looked up at the big empty sky. It called out to me, sent me straight for the roof.  The simplicity of the darkness was welcoming. I stared out at the city below, the vast expanse of darkness above, and the cool green emptiness of the roof in front.  It was too much to pass up. I laid down in the cold solitude, listening to the silence.  The chaos of my mind melted away into the vast darkness. I stared at Orion, tried to find the onion sisters, looked for anything resembling a constallation. I started making ones up, just to entertain myself. I said hello to a planet, then realized it was moving and sparkling too much.  A plane heading towards me off in the distance. Too slow and large to be a satellite.  I wanted to lay there all night, exist in the world again instead of what's created.  I lifted my head. Damn it. The world was still there, the lights and sirens blaring up from below.  I picked up my gloves, walked downstairs, and went to bed.  Today: Rush of happy just hit me about five minutes ago. Gonna ride it out while I can.

      As I walked to work today, I had the lovely opportunity of being yelled at by a guy on the back of a garbage truck, something about white, then a merry christmas, to which I replied, Merry Christmas (why be a bitch?) and as the truck pulls along he 's yelling about holidays and mistletoe and how I better kiss my man under the mistletoe. Oddly, all that made me smile and pulled me out of my foulness. Even if it was from a "waste disposal manager."  A HATE to add another one of these, but I'll forget about it if I don't put it up now. I won't do any more for at least a week!  I promise.  1. What did you do in 2003 that you'd never done before? Got drunk, and made out with random people at a club. What a badge of honor.  2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I forgot what they were, but I suspect, no.  For next year? I’ll do what I’ve been doing, constantly making resolutions and trying to keep them, breaking them, then trying again.  3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Someone got pregnant…oh duh! My boss and a former coworker both gave birth this year to girls!  Adorable children.  4. Did anyone close to you die? Geez, I hope not. That would really suck to forget someone died.  5. What countries did you visit? Georgia, no, wait, that’s a state, a state in a nation, not a, eh, how many IR junkies are running around this site anyway?  The humor’s lost on the rest of you.  6. What would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003? Love…this is turning into a damn quest for the holy grail, isn’t it? Well, as one of those people who’s never been in anything long term or serious or really had anyone mean anything to them, I’d like to find that, have that, so I can say I know the feeling at least.  7. What date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? July.  A lot of shit went down, I went a bit crazy, had sleeping and eating issues, and was all around miserable, excited and angry in brand new ways!  8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? Making (new) friends  9. What was your biggest failure? My career? Wait, that’s ongoing…my efforts this year have been failures mostly, but I’m finally moving back into gear.  10. Did you suffer illness or injury? Almost had heat stroke twice, strained an ankle, got ill several times from stress.  No viruses though.  11. What was the best thing you bought? A pewter vase for my mom from the art festival in NoHo  12. Whose behavior merited celebration? You know who you are.  13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? I can’t mention them here.  14. Where did most of your money go? Rent  15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? Finding new playmates in town  16. What song will always remind you of 2003? Shit, considering the sheltered CD land I live in, it’s hard to come up with something so quickly.  I’ll let you know in two years, that’s when I’ll finally hear something and think, “man, 2003.”  17. Compared to this time last year, are you: i. happier or sadder? happier ii. thinner or fatter? thinner (I think) iii. richer or poorer? poorer  18. What do you wish you'd done more of? What I’m supposed to do.  19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Shirk responsibilities  20. How will you be spending Christmas? At home with family  22. Did you fall in love in 2003? I found something, but it’s not love.  I’m still trying to figure it out.  23. How many one-night stands? Actual one night stands? None. Random encounters where I never saw the person again: one  24. What was your favorite TV program? Trading Spaces  25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? Yes.  26. What was the best book you read? Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury  27. What was your greatest musical discovery? Some old albums from Sting, the Wallflowers, Belle and Sebastian. I would love to discover my stolen CD's in my desk. You fool, you got Cheb Mami, Simpsons, Cake, Arabic Oddysey, Amelie, the soundtrack to a Hindi film, and a bunch of other stuff I'm certain you consider crap. Bring it back!  28. What did you want and get? Several books and CDs from my Amazon list (Thanks), furniture.  29. What did you want and not get? Peace of mind, salamander (or some good house critter. I know, no salamander’s, it’s cruel to keep them from freedom).  30. What was your favorite film of this year? City of God  31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? As the day began, I was at a post Halloween party full of excellent costumes, improvisers and friends. I went home on the last train out. I awoke to a happiness I cannot remember having before, singing to myself and rolling around on the bed like a dog that just found something really great to roll in, existing in bliss. I spent the rest of the day enjoying existence and lighting the alter I made for Dia de los muertos and thanking God for such perfection.  I then went to improv class, and actually made it through the day with only three people remembering that it was my birthday. It’s one of the few opportunities in life when I’m still new enough to a place that I can maintain anonymity on my least anonymous day of the year.  I turned 24, and it was one of the happiest days of my life.  32.What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? Achieving number 6 above.  33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003? Aiming for something more stylish, closer to Deirdre Lyons sense, but with my usual lack of flair.  34. What kept you sane? Improv, Shelley, Jane, Jack, Kate, Lia  35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? Clay Aiken.  Geeks have more power when we unite!  36. What political issue stirred you the most? Imperialism should cover it all  37. Who did you miss? Jyot, Molly, Lisa, April, Pan, Dede, and a host of other MHCers  38. Who was the best new person you met? Hmmm, if I say one and not the other, who will be more pissed? Let’s just say, "Kansas City, thank you."    39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003 Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.  40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year "I feel fine, With the sun in my eyes, The wind in my hair, When I’m falling out of this sky, I’m doing better than I thought I would, But nothing’s ever as good, As when you’re on top"  "Too late to quit, too soon to go"

      Our aptly titled "You can't [attack] the willing" went down last night. A decent showing. We've done much better, but we've also crashed in the past, so average is OK. Heck, the audience enjoyed it, which is what really matters, especially for one that pays (these were family, friends, coworkers, so they saw it for free, but most of us are working towards performing for audiences, and well, they pay money to watch).  Given more time, and possibly a different structure, we cold kick some ass. Hell, the last showcase rocked, and some of the classes have had excellent sets. The "Walmart Bonanza Store" is still my favorite.  What we did this time: A series of short unrelated scenes for 10 minutes, followed by three duolouges, which lead into a 30-minute piece.  The only thing that really stuck from the duologues were seamonkeys, including seamonkey prison, seamonkey UN and seamonkey whores.  Amazingly, the show remained relatively clean. Possibly our subconscious blocked us from our usual material (child molestation, abuse, racism, death, anything non-pc).  We only kept up with some ethnic sterotypes and whores. Otherwise, we weren't the least bit insulting, to anyone.    An interesting comment from the group that performed before us, "you guys really fuck around." I can't remeber if it was about the general nature of how we play scenes, or about how we play with each other. Either way, in improv, it's a good thing.  Life's dull otherwise.

      Mild stress, worry for the show, work to accomplish, not sure where or how to accomplish.  I’m rambling, unable to explain my point fully.  Iran’s a young democracy, working it’s way there at least, and of any country has the best shot.  There are differences, state control and religious control for one, but the US extends its actions into other nations instead of imposing itself on its own people as often.  Or maybe we’re all lead to believe we’re freer and more open and democratic than other nations, just as those nations think themselves better than us.  It’s these blinders which allow people to not know of the injustice that goes on, to “ignore” genocide and apartheid, because information’s is so well controlled.  Something like that. There are holes galore with this concept, exceptions, but just work with the concept and see where it takes your mind.  Then you’ll understand what I’m getting at.  There is no “them,” there is only “us”  On the home front, I love the Wallflowers Red Letter Days album.  As much as I love Johnny Cash. That’s a lot.  Later I’ll put a top ten movies list up for 2003. As usual, most of the good pieces aren’t coming out until the end of the year. City of God, American Splendor, Bend it Like Beckham and Kill Bill will all be on the list. We’ll see what Jackson does before I toss his work on to this.  I don’t know what else will qualify.  “Wheaton said he also intended to name several high-powered people who knew about the secret relationship, including U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Perry Jr. of Columbia, who Thurmond in 1976 helped make the first black appointed to a federal judgeship from the Deep South. Perry acknowledged to The Post that he is a longtime friend of Williams. Perry said they briefly dated when they were college students, at a time when Thurmond visited the campus to see her despite his 1948 campaign as a Dixiecrat segregationist candidate for president.   But Perry, 79, said of Thurmond, "I never raised the subject with him, nor he with me. There was never any acknowledgement of her existence or of my relationship with her." Perry was a noted civil rights attorney and counsel to the state and national NAACP before his elevation to the bench. After four years on the U.S. Court of Military Appeals (now known as U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), President Jimmy Carter named him to a U.S. district judgeship. The federal courthouse in Columbia is named in his honor. “  -  urlLink Washington Post  There’s a really great scene in that.

      1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays? Love it, as long as people can still get about!  2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect? Ideal celebration is with family and friends, a nice, quite morning of gifts, followed by a deliciously filling supper.  Perfect people to have: a select group of people who make me happy, snuggled away at a cozy home, but close enough to a movie theater in case people want to run out for a bit.  Listening to good holiday music.  3. Do you do have any holiday traditions? Close to above, plus coconut and citrus fruit salad and cinnamon rolls for breakfast.  4. Do you do anything to help the needy? We've started giving to charity instead of gifts for most of the family (kids still get gifts).  5. What one gift would you like for yourself? Fashion sense, haha! Uhm, hmmm...oh! My own apartment/condo to own! Yeah.

      Overly excited, stimulated, something, been like this for hours, didn’t even sleep very deep because of it. Laid in bed in the shallowest of sleep for an hour before I finally got up and went online, then gave up about an hour later and resigned myself to the fact that I should close my eyes for at least eight hours. Made it until 6:30, then fell back into that non-sleep for another hour and a half before I finally woke up and ran into work, late again.   The excitement is from what, I don’t know, maybe good improv, caffeine yesterday, anticipation, that’s what it is. For the showcase, because it could so easily blow or surpass all expectations? For shows this weekend to watch and work, for Saturday, for unplanned trips which once were planned? Self confidence?  I was beaming like I got action, what a bunch of dudes. Ah ha! I made them blush, I embarrassed everyone in the room, made them all horribly uncomfortable with a not-so-dirty phrase that just shocked them all. Cut with the bull scene, the Beelzebub and Sharon story line, the laughing couple in the suicide fields, Pablo at John’s Blanco staple store, selling souls, stalkers, stood-up dates, art and daisies, mmm, smells like daisies in here! Haha (inferring ass).  The crazy brother and the corpse in the closet, the brother’s desire to be with someone funny, the body falling out, and the line, “see, that’s not funny,” splendid!    The first set was a bizarre hodgepodge of cult murders, bodies, explosives, marshmallows in the dessert,  farm life, and I’m not sure what else. The third set was weak too, with a bizarre sequence of birthing babies on the beach. Faggot café was somewhere in there, as well as the Cuban boat refugees with drink service on their raft.   Yeah, the second set was pretty strong, and we could have all come together at the park for one giant final scene, or done a few duologues to settle the pieces out.  There was a good moment at the end of the third, where a duologue came in about why beach birthing was banned.    Yikes, only two more rehearsals.  I’m on edge, like too much caffeine on edge, but I haven’t had any since last night.  I think June was the last time I was this ancee, or maybe July?  I need to listen more during the duologues. I get so wrapped up in maintaining character I miss half the material said.  Oh, dig around the New York Times for an article on comedy college up in Toronto. You’ll see that all comedians are disturbed, all our material suitably dark amidst the light.

      One of the creations returned last night, the first time in ages I’ve seen any of them. I’m not sure what this signals, me back to protective hiding or a surge in my creativity and they’re simply a side effect to all this. I like the comfort of them, yes, but I also tend to barrel off into misery and reclusion when they’re around.    You’re thinking I’m really messed up, or at least on something right now. They’re not real, or even something to describe, simply figments of my imagination. Real figments, not the I’m-telling-myself-they’re-not-real-kind, but the actually not real kind, the I-made-them-up-ages-ago for all the stories I used to create in my head on long road trips. Well, you spend enough time with an idea, you start to relate to it in some way.  I went a good ten years solid with two basic storylines, and in the past two years they’ve all but ceased to exist, even for attempts to put the tales on paper.  Now it’s decision time: bury them and maintain reality, or indulge a bit and see if I can get enough to put some stories down?

      Yay!  Glad to be lonely right now. Finally on my own after way too much person to person time. I need to recharge my damn batteries.    Fantastic, and I truly mean fantastic, evening last night. Big ol' debate on monocultures, to the point people started shifitng tables to escape. Intellectual talk, such splendid perfection of minds, ugh, to hear people thinking again! I just needed to sober up enough so I could follow the damn conversation better.  They'd be off discussing economies and cultural attitudes and then I'd hear Johnny Cash and start listening to that, then pick up on the table behind us talking about our conversation, then swing back in to some other point, which I couldn't quite follow or didn't seem to have a point, and then did it all over again.    I'll also let you know now, no alchohol for a week for me. 4 heavy drinks on an empty stomach, and the worse I got was a hangover this morning.  Fantastic buzz last night, but I think I'm craving a bit. So got to bust up the pathways in my brain before they're reinforced anymore.  Show sold out, people turned away again. Saturday night, crazy night always.  Sounds like a system's coming into line for the waitlist too. Good.  It's frustrating not having full control of how people get in etc, since they equate everyone they meet as working for the same people.  Show was OK, audience seemed to enjoy it. Not too impressed. Yesterday was better. Thursday was too, on an energy level scale, not on skill/cleanliness.  OH!  Plans set for New Years...Yay! Muy alegre.

      The Timberlake album’s hysterical. Nothing like white boy, what the hell is it anyway? I never know when something’s R&B, Hip Hop, Rap, or should fall into Urban.  Such differences in the genres, but I’m ignorant like that.  I’ll go online later and see what I can use to distinguish them.  It’s kinda like country, in that the genres are in transition and while I can say for sure with older material what’s what, all the new stuff has a bit of the popular, this will sell feel to them.    It’s snowing. Snowing somewhere around us. We just have rain and cold. Some snow last night, maybe some more tonight, but you can feel it, fell when there’s too much hype and when we’ll actually see something. People around us have snow, just not here in town.  I managed to complete three loads of laundry last night, as well as clean half the apartment. I’m heading home to finish the job, including a proper scrubbing of the kitchen and bathroom, before I work the show tonight.    Yes, shows are back!  Please come on a Thursday night, since no one seems to bother besides a few hardy souls. And guess what yo - the other shows sell out. Think about it, packed in there, or worse, arriving late and not getting in at all, or waltzing in, putting your money down, and a nice intimate evening? Bring more folk and let’s start selling Thursdays out too.  (Link’s to the left)  Four days of improv a week now, shows three nights, class another, and we’re working on a couple of more classes before our showcase on the 17th.  My brain’s overly saturated at this point, but I keep on chugging along. Last week was fun actually, once I ignored the pain in my head.  All I can say is we are sick fucks.  Makes us a lot of fun to watch, just don’t bring any children or people who can’t exist outside of a PC world (I ain’t talking computers here).

      Everyone,  While the polls have been off and on with their accuracy as of late, do not let Kerry run away with this election.  I fear people are joining the bandwagon and not informing themselves. You have the power; use it to make a statement about this country, and don't hand it over to who "everyone else seems to be for."  Make Kerry prove himself.  Make the Democratic party prove itself. Get informed.

      Everyone needs a bit of enticement now and then, and the campaigns want to feed our needs.  Each camp has it’s own style and therefore its own unique methods:  From Edwards, you can get a recipe for  urlLink Peanut Butter pie  from Bobbie Edwards, John’s Mother.  Mmm, down home cooking.  Edwards has been the guiltiest of the outright give-away tactics. He offered a free “Turkey-Bush” T-shirt last quarter, while Dean made special buttons available for a $30 contribution during Halloween.  Edwards even offers his book, “Four Trials,” with a contribution of $35.  To cap it all off, for $50 you can see  urlLink Hootie and the Blowfish   ($35 for students) on January 30th in SC.  Clark’s playing with his military theme.  urlLink “C company” fundraisers  the night of the party: reward for a successful fundraiser? You get to participate in a conference call with the General. Or, you can simply  urlLink become a recruiter .   OK, he’s  urlLink lost his mind :  And for a look at his career path: see the Post.  Poor, poor Dean.  I feel sorry for the man.  He should have a chance, but every move his campaign makes destroys another part of him. Now it’s Gore’s cronies running the show.   urlLink Here  is why I love my team.   And why is it that when I get stressed, I cry? Is it an estrogen thing or am I just a freak?  This sucks.  Stupid brain (but I love ya, kinda like the Panthers).

      Odd, what I’ve heard in the news “coming out of the White House” has been scare tactics mostly.  A thick file on Kerry, they’ve prepared plans for Dean, they’d love to have Edwards since he’s a trial lawyer, and are most worried about Lieberman. Hmm, I can guess the unsaid bias hidden in there.    I would HOPE the democrats have a fantastic file on Bush since he took office, on all the things he said, all his unfulfilled promises, and have the COMMON SENSE to shape the arguments themselves instead of being controlled by the Republicans.  Heck, even the Republicans are getting ticked at Bush.  And I’m sure inside they’re saying don’t worry, we’ll take care of you, we’ll cut back on spending, it’ll all be OK.    Guess what, whether you’re left of center or far right of center (economically), ok if you want government programs or you really think the government should mind it’s own business, you better get rid of Bush.  He may not be the one coming up with the ideas, but his group is the one we need to remove, the people pushing these agendas. You want freedom, you need a new president, a new cabinet, new advisors. You need a new man in office.  Brrr, it’s cold in here!  Yes, the office vents are blowing cold air, not heat, and I’m wearing a sweatshirt and gloves as I attempt to work.    Smile for last night, minus me losing my license somewhere. Not good.  It’s an act of God to keep, shit, I can’t fly without it, and I don’t have any other current viable ID.  Fudge. I can see keeping me out of bars, but man, I got a meeting to attend.  Focus, regroup, prepare.  Back to work!  “Followers of perennial presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche interrupted a campaign event for Dean on Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire, before being drowned out by his supporters and removed from the room with the assistance of author-commentator Al Franken. They screamed that Dean is ‘a liar’ and not a Democrat. They said the only candidates telling the truth are LaRouche and Kerry.”  -  urlLink From CNN  There’s an endorsement you want.  In the commercial field, Kerry, you’re an idiot. All my work on the 48hour film project, watching shorts and documentaries and seeing independent low end productions allow me to see that while you have more funds, your ad’s about as crappy as Clark’s early ones where he sat in front of a curtain with one camera and spoke (FYI, Clark now has good ad, the latest one on families, his only good one).  Look at  urlLink this page . You can dig around the  urlLink exit polls  by state, see how many delegates candidates currently have, and compare them on the issues.  Fantastic resource!   Yes, I’ll move onto another topic eventually.  Just bear with me for a bit.    Reading the speeches last night, Dean’s positions are interesting, if not good.  Morality on an international scale, recreating a sense of community and uniting America.    Sad bit of info: Edwards said on the Today show that he does not want to be VP, he would say “no” if asked.  Edwards, you’re a fucking idiot.  The WMD debate.  I read or heard, the issue is not whether we were lied to, but whether our information gathering systems are good enough (what world leader, however haughty, would outright lie and convince intelligence agencies from several other nations to “get in on it” including countries who disagree with you)?    Negative on current "front runner" Kerry, while a war Veteran, did vote to cut CIA funding…not good when we’re fussing about security. And you know how good the Bush juggernaut is at spinning and controlling words.

      Yech, cold and rain/sleet.  Not enough to keep us from work, but enough to challenge those on the move.  Hmm. At least there’s the radio. My new friend in the office. Yet, like all friends, they tend to be distracting. Sunday, saw the masterful work Gandhi.  Excellent look into reality.  And into the absolute horror of humanity.  The scene where the British come in and massacre men, women and children gathered for a peaceful protest was truly horrifying.  That’s one of the few occasions I actually feel the death penalty would be OK.  “They needed to be taught a lesson” or something along that line; cold, cold, inhumanity.  It’s hard for most of us to imagine here, er, well, hard for those who live a good life to realize, the absolute horror of the world.  I always wonder about similarities and differences, how those who fuss here, those who live in poverty here, compare to those fussing and/or living in poverty elsewhere.  Some reactions and words I hear I know they don’t a thing, don’t realize pain and suffering although they yell as if they do.  There’s a scream of agnoy, tehre’s a horror in life, a misery, that once it exists, I believe it’s the same for all, whatever you came from, wherever you are. But there’s also that “I feel like everything’s horrible” when you’re living in such splendid perfection. No not, the misery of depression, that’s another beast, and another issue. I’m talking about those wo’s problem is a bad lawn, who scream because life’s not exactly as they like it, because their neighbors aren’t following community procedures for car ownership who are in misery because now they have to walk to work or can’t go out as much.  If those are your problems, get the hell over it.  Go watch a film about the rest of the world, about the truly evil things we do to each other and thank God for your chance to live, breathe, eat, and drink.  There are people in this country who know pain, who understand, but the majority, even in their economic worries, are nowhere near the dire straigths of so many others.  We fuss about two towers falling, our loss of security, for those right there, at that moment, they understand, for those form other places where horror exists, they understand, but for the rest of us, shut the fuck up. We’re living in Golden sunshine. Horror of almost 3,000 dead? That number is miniscule.  We’ve blown up more people, burned more people, starved more people with the flick of a switch.  Open up your eyes to all the cruelty of existence and stop shrieking about…I can’t think of a good general example, but unless you can imagine, no I don’t want to clutter your world with such a thought.  Watch Fog of War, watch Battle of Algiers, watch Gandhi, find any film exploring South Africa’s apartheid, read about these things, the Holocaust, Stalin’s prison camps, Australia and the United States treatment of native peoples, find a documentary even and see how years ago we stripped away humanity. We’ve all done it for years, ever since we existed. It’s just we have bigger sticks now.  And when I say we I don’t just mean America, I mean all of us, all of everyone who has ever existed, has been a witness, a victim, a participant, at some point, in some way.  Why else would so many religious teachings aim for peace, agreement, compromise and love?  We don’t have to be reminded to be cruel, we must be reminded how to be kind.

      An  urlLink old article  about WIT’s last run. FYI, there’s still one weekend left to catch Improv Nation and Jackie. Then WIT mainstage returns to debut the Neutrino Video Project.   We had a tech run yesterday to work out any bugs with the equipment, so now I finally understand the process. You must come see it: three teams, one audience, one movie, all filmed on location(s) while you sit snug inside the theater. Truly instant movie making.  Anyone know any press people, tell them to come see this.  It’s cool.  For those still needing  urlLink Planners for 2004 , I highly recommend this.  Best I can do for a link to  urlLink Dean's speech . It's not that crazy or angry.  It's all how you shape the argument.  And if you want to bring him down, this is perfect ammunition.  Howard Kurtz’s  urlLink media notes : a good place to keep up with the rest of the news sources.  Is this an  urlLink assignment  from the mind of an intern?   OH, a small victory yesterday.  I won't go into specifics, but yay.   And to discuss further the last entry, I'm back on the beach enjoying the sun and complaining about the heat.  Normal, er, as normal as I get. Haha.  I'm making phone calls tonight, so keep an eye out for weird numbers (I use a phone card remember?).  Read  urlLink this entry too , January 24th.  I've seen the guy three times now, twice at the movies, and yesterday at a coffehouse.

I’m fighting the urge to fuss at myself, to yell at me, because it will only bring me further down.  I’m trying to keep my head up and ride this one out, for a bit, ride back to shore and recoup.    I may reduce entries for a bit, just to be certain I don’t write something foolish (When my mind’s like it is its judgement is different.

      Dean's yell. Does anyone know where I can find a link? I actualy like it.  Too bad there's such a tight definition of "acceptable" when it comes to candidate behavior.  OK, so he's not my favorite anyway, but the reaction of people to his response makes me want to support him, simply to go against the status quo.  Dean is in deep trouble. At my visit today to his site, low and behold there's a pop-up ad for him! A pop-up ad? Man, you're really scumming it now.  Kerry has redesigned his site once more.  It looks amazingly like that of Wes Clark's page.  Once again Kerry shows his preference for presenting himself as a poser and follower.  Dean may be the crazy radical, but Kerry's the next Mondale.  Edwards still has an overly bulky, too busy site, but the bulk of his supporters won't be online anyway.  Hell, it's only a particular demographic you can reach here. He's placing his efforts elsewhere.   I'm curious as to what all the mailings look like from the candidates.  Must wait and see.  Thoughts from Yesterday: Now that the results are in, here’s what to expect: One, should Dean fail to win the nomination, it’s up to the Dems to keep the new people involved in the process.  Two, if Dean wins the nomination, the party needs to embrace him and someone should hire some PR specialists to tone this guy down (both he and Clark sound like liberal versions of Bush, people who know what’s right, know their minds, and aren’t open to discussion).  A Kerry/Edwards Ticket seems very possible, and maybe a Dean/Edwards or Clark/Edwards. Well, you get the idea, Edwards as a VP, which I hope he will take should he not get the nomination.  I’m liking Edwards more and more now; he talks the talk, and his wife is fantastic.  He won a lot of trials because he knows how to win over an audience.   Oh, the dude that got told to sit down, quite possibly is the same one, or part of a group, that came around earlier. Check the weblogs of the Dean site back in June I think, sometime over the summer, maybe as early as May even, and you’ll see. They’ve been working on Dean for awhile.    Can I just state, once again, how bizarre people are?  Point one: See Rabbit Proof Fence for general attitude issues that stem from a “superior” position. Point two: Taking an OTC decongestant, which normally makes me tired, calms me down when I’m stressed (I actually took for congestion, but just noticed this).  Now I’m happy and able to get my work done and not freaking out and ready to run out the door.  What’s odd is how minds influence bodies, even when you’re aware of what’s happening and that you’re overreacting, there’s a trigger somewhere, a switch, that still needs to be turned so you can act the way you should and the way you want to.    I still believe there’s a way to get at this anxiety thing without outside chemicals (including decongestants, not just pharms), a way to utilize your own body chemistry’s oddities to readjust.  Must look into this.

      I’m listening to the crap station again.  Call it rubbernecking.  The lyrics to a circle of life, don’t take more than you give, wheel of fortune stuff, that’s hypocritical. It’s calling for equality as part of a natural order and balance, then cites life's randomness with a wheel of fortune, leap of faith.  Now you know why the  people who like this stuff always seem so confused by common sense.  Their brains are inundated with mixed messages.  Just munched on some sour patch kids. There’s an ad on the bag for Hawaiian Punch chewies.  Man, Hawaiian punch. I used to freeze the boxes in the summer time, then cut open the top, get a big metal spoon, and just dig into ‘em.  That takes me back. Hmmm.  For those who need some fun Tuesday night, I highly recommend  urlLink watching the state of the union .  Last year a buddy and I talked over IM while watching.

Movies for 2003 Top Rank: City of God, In America, Kill Bill Volume 1 Second Rank: American Splendor, X2, Beckham, and He loves me, he loves me not Honorable mention: The Animation Show Crap: Italian Job, Everybody says I’m fine  I’m still trying to see 2003 movies. I’ve only seen twenty so far, lots of art house indy foreign things mostly.  I need to expand back into the realm of the populous. No Lord bandwagon.  I’m still pissed watching the white westerners go out to destroy the evil idolatrous colored folk from the south and east.  Yes, it’s in the book, but there you can pretend people look different and that this isn’t a crusades recreation.

      Our nice Yankee neighbors have a few things to say about my hometown:  urlLink Daily News   With all the politics talk, it’s high time I link you to the various sites that matter, before anyone’s cast a vote (and ignoring the nonbinding DC primary, which would have been binding, but Iowa has some deal that makes certain they’re first. Good for them).  Clark, Dean, Edwards, Kerry.  I'll attend thier meetups shortly, and discover if thier supporters can convince me. Check the right for the links.  No one else is going on my list.  These four have somewhat of a shot, and I’ll let you know who I decide to endorse. Hell, I might even wander off to one of those caucus things here in town if I’m allowed in.  How does misinformation and perception work?  Read  urlLink this page , then read  urlLink this and the comments   Ran across an interesting link, not quite  urlLink Secretary's day , but along the same lines. I found the  urlLink link on here .    More “ urlLink revitalization ” in DC: Flashpoint, 916 G street  White House Rejects O’Neill Criticism - Search the title to find the article. Don’t you love how everything about the Iraq war centers on WMD?  Why don’t we replay that clip from the 2000 debates of Bush saying our military is spread to thin, that our troops should come home, we shouldn’t be involved in nation building,  and shape the argument of the Iraq war into one of broken promises?    Also, you won’t need much effort to suggest that Hussein, while an ass and a shit, is not the only ass and shit to murder hundreds of thousands (did he get into the millions? How sad is our world?) of innocent people out there either.    Here’s more evidence that the Democrats are about to get trounced:  urlLink Sowing the Seeds of GOP Domination, Conservative Norquist Cultivates Grass Roots Beyond the Beltway   Wow, I know I’m thinking too much when I find myself with Celine Dion playing on the radio.

      Whale Rider Didn't come off as one of my favorties for the year, but it has its moments.  Overall, good.  Nikki Caro's persona comes off in the film's direction, which leaves me slightly dissatisfied. It could easily be the result of the story itself. I think I expected a stronger, something. I really enjoyed the "making of" feature on the DVD.  Other than the principle actors, all the people in the film came from the town where the movie was set/filmed.  Fantastic.  Sadly, it also shows most people can act, at least in familiar situations.  I say sadly since so many people make it their primary objective to treat acting as god-given talent.  "Well, I always believed," Do you know how many people have always believed? And how many actually made it? Belief keeps you going, but it doesn't get you there.  60 Minutes I watched most of the interview with the author and the former Treasury Secretary, and boy, yahoo!  I really want to read it now. All my suspicions about earleir have been confirmed. Even poor ol' Bush is a victim of his group, based on the interview.  Whoever the dems choose, can just pull excerpts from this guy's book.  How did the White House respond? Basically they said the President makes important decisions for the country.  There's some hard hitting information for you.  I'll tell you one more time, check out Vital Lies, Simple Truths and read the chapters on groups.  I know this happens in all administrations (Fog of War or Thirteen Days will show you similar patterns), but some exist in a much tighter, smaller linked mindset than others. Hence the idiocy and sheer bravado of the current leaders.  Bubba Ho-tep A movie from 2002, they just re-released it here in DC with the opening of a new theater.  Entertaining. I remember the Post reviewer questioned its existence, the plot and the believability of the film.  It's one of those campy cult flicks which is admired for its sheer lack of taste, so don't go in looking for the next Oscar contender. Enjoy it for itself.  Think MST3K and you'll know what I'm talking about.   Panthers/Eagles Charlotte adopted the name Cardiac Cats for the current team, and darn if they didn't live up to it again. Now they face Philly next Sunday night.  Eeek.

      This town’s Gibbs crazy.  He’s been the lead story on the news and in the Post for the past three days.  I can’t wait to see what happens when reality kicks in.  Even Lombardi couldn’t live up to the expectations currently being set.  We’ll see.    New theaters and movies opening this weekend mean lots of excitement for yours truly.  In my strenuous efforts to reduce my time spent running around, I’ve managed to book myself with an activity almost every night through the end of the month.  It’s crazy, I really need to find a health class of some sort to enter into, but then that’s another day I’m not available.   This week: movie week. Next week: dinner and back to improv shows, Week next: politics week, from the State of the Union Address (and drinking game, yay) to meetups of various Democratic candidates.    I have yet to make my decision who I like, who I would support.  I want a winner, I want someone this country can get behind, but based on current talk and strategy, not a single one seems to grasp reality.  A friend just  urlLink published a book  about his time on the Bradley campaign, and the passion he had for that man’s values.  I haven’t found that either.   The incumbent’s been shaping our perceptions, and continues to shape the nature of issues.  He can be taken down, but right now, no one’s really saying anything that has any purpose in it, any force. Those with something interesting don’t carry the necessary respect to be heard, and those who have respect have nothing to say.  The Republicans are well organized, they’ve learned.  It seems the Democrats will need a THIRD defeat before they can reorganize.  Or maybe that’s what they need, a break, a split, a new party.  It’s happened before, it can happen again.  OK, so the world of the US isn’t chaotic enough to bring change yet, but one can hope.  Ignorance still amazes me.  Clark’s working on women’s votes. As a graduate of a women’s college, I find  urlLink this article  pandering and stupid. We need to be educated about what a general is like? And the Lt Governor, a female herself, wants to know what it’s like to talk to a general?  What the hell?  Are they aliens from outer space?  That’s about the only thing I could encounter in which I’d wonder how they thought.  People are people, and you treat each as an individual. You should expect equal differences and similarities, take things as they are.  Culture, background, play a role, but that can vary from the person two doors down and the one three doors down as much as it does for someone on another continent.  Ugh!   Dean’s in trouble, based on the reaction of his campaign. He should keep on like he was, and let the world be. Either people will deal, or they’ll freak.  Why try to change so you can win now and lose later? Think of the final goal, new President of the US.  Oh, and  urlLink this seems typical  of Bush during an election year:  He’s always managed to tick people off from both sides.  What amazes me is how he’s known to have wrecked everything he’s ever managed, dumping it off on someone else at the last minute.  He’s doing the same now. He has no business sense, little common sense, and just too much “I know (or, you know, whatever, sounds good)” going on.  Some people shouldn’t run companies, and Bush is one of those. He shouldn’t run this country either. There are those unsuitable for leading countries for other reasons, but the business analogy is the strongest argument in my book.

      Have we all gone mad or is the  urlLink next proposal  from our commander a look back into the 50's?  Maybe we should see about investing in robots to clean our houses so we'll have more leisure time, plus automated kitchen appliances. Whoo hoo.  Last night viewed Fog of War. While the cinematography was interesting, there were very few revelations in the film.  Two interesting points I gleamed 1) McNamara and Rumsfeld are paternal twins.  2) If the US ever enters any international justice system, McNamara's taped confession that he and others are war criminals will save the court some time.  Us or them, you gotta win. Pretty simple really. As long as you're in power, you can do bad things and punish others for the same actions you commit.  When you lose, you're going to jail.  Interesting how laws differ on the international scale from national and state laws.  There really are different moral and ethical rules at play when large organized groups are involved (heck, even corporations operate in a different paradigm from people, although both are recognized as having equal rights).  Sadly, these girls will be scarred for life.  Too many  urlLink maniacs  out there

      I decided to entertain myself by perusing some conservative sites. Here’s one example of the whining that goes on by everyone, courtesy of  urlLink Robert Levy . Come on!  I don’t agree that money equals speech.  I see the physical connection to buying time, ad space, paying for smarter campaign staff, but let’s take the concept to its logical conclusion. You have more money, you may speak more. Now if society operated on this feature, The guy who rants and raves in the street everyday outside my office would have to shut up.  Paris Hilton could say anything she wanted, whenever.  A lot of us would only be allowed limited time to speak.  Yet, that’s not how it works.  You can be broke and talk all you want, rich and silent, rich and talkative (Murdoch’s powerhouse), money does not equal speech, and speech does not equal money. It’s a boost, just like knowing the uncle to the governor or being old high school buds with the most influential business person in town.   I would suggest assigning a monetary value to those connections and limiting those as well, but now I’m getting into that bizarre gray area, where you can’t really measure what’s going on through money alone.  How would you decide the value of endorsement, of connections?  It’s like trying to assign monetary value to ecosystem services, you know, wetlands cleaning water as it’s filtered through, carbon sequestration from trees; There are too many variables to deal with.   I get the point, influence and connections can be just as useful, if not better, than cold hard cash.  Which tells us, there is no level playing field.  An incumbent has an advantage, their name is already known.  You have an advantage if you happen to have the right friends.  That’s pretty impossible to control.  But we can control money. Doesn’t mean we should, but there’s this bizarre sense among some people that everyone in this country should have an even shot at whatever they want to do, and money’s one of the few ways we can make that hill a little less steep. Doesn’t make it right, but building that hill as high and steep as you can isn’t too bright either.  Hmm, I’ve gotten nowhere with this.  I’m going to stew a bit more.  If you have any thoughts, contact me. Link’s on the right.

       urlLink Bush's cash cow   Think of what we could do with this money.  Think of all the people who you could help, had you invested even half of those funds into public services, charities, foundations, etc.    Why is it we can spend so much money on oursleves?  I wish everyone would simply set a celing spending limit, and let people get creative on how to spend those funds, instead of constantly feeding this beast.  For either party actually, not just the current juggernaut.  Don't ask why our society's messed up. You've got evidence right there in front of you.

      Carolina Pnahters beat Dallas in the NFC Wild Card game last night. Point one of excitement. WIT shows wrapped up last night, leaving a week's break before the next show set. Point two of excitement WIT had a party at the Angry Inch. Point three of excitement.  We had a soultrain dance line, dance circles, break dancing, slow country dancing, you name it. So much fun to party with these people. All these months of work have left me knowing just about everyone in the WIT family. Superb to see several old classmates again as well as the usual gang.  Don't know what was up though. I only had two full drinks and that totally wasted me. Maybe all that dancing and the warm weather didn't help.   Anyway, ended up heading home early, which sucks, but other than taking my contacts out, I fell straight into bed. OK, I got my clothes off and fell into bed and woke up a bit later half buried in blankets and half buried in pillows. Just smashed. So the mission this morning is to drink fluids and chill on this cloudy day.  You should smell the air, like spring. Birds are out to play too. The forecast says we'll freeze starting Tuesday, but still have a couple of nice days left.  In news, dems debated again.  No clue what's going on anymore.  If we get a nominee who's like Bush, you run the competition for swing voters and loose most greens.  If you get Dean, you won't get the middle man, but you could possibly get the greens and more from the left.  Do they vote though? And how many will jump ship for Nader?    FYI, we're turning ourselves into a developing nation with these terror alerts.  That's what the military regime in Burma does as well, except they come knocking on your door and tell you rebels are on the loose and to have someone up on the lookout.  Living in a land of fear.  Living in a land of "me."  That's a great social structure.    Hell it's why I figure we should just wait life out.  To make this country better, like so many hometowns, requires a shift in attitudes and lifestyles. Not a revolution or a particular political ideology, but a social attitude adjustment.  Just like democracy though, it takes the will of the people to institute the change.  You can never force either one. It always fails when you force.

      Happy new year all! Ok, a bit late, but what is that day other than a randomly selected period in a number sequence?  You missed a good time. Good quite evening with excellent company, drinking, and board games! Plus champagne and shouting on the roof.  I feel bad for the one sober person, but hopefully she'll forgive us.  She stayed a while. I think that means we were ok.    Three hours the other night, then a full night, but I'll be darned if I feel like I've slept at all. Crap sleep that merely passes the time away but your brain never actually relaxes.  Some people read, but I get bored or distracted after a page or two. Just can't focus if you're tired.  I actually had to turn the tv on to sleep the other night, not sure what this mind is up to that it needs a distraction like that in order to unwind and relax. Or maybe it's the body sleeping, resting, while the mind is so troubled that it stays up to listen to the box b/c it can't sleep. That's all that seperates me from the insomniacs right now: my body can still force itself down.  I'll make phone calls sometime soon to folk, I owe a bunch of you.  No other thoughts for now. My head hurts. G'night.

      Woah man!  What an evening.  We viewed very drunk college students, walked over to Georgetown then spent the rest of the evening at Mr Smiths hanging with firefighters from NYC.  They were in town visiting the injured troops over at Walter Reed, and themselves were heavily involved in the whole 9/11 aftermath.  A friendly bunch, and as expected mostly conservative, but there was one lib in the group who, if he didn't have someone waiting for him back in NYC, I would have made out with.  They were older, by a good amount, but great company.  I wish them all the best.  Today we're off to a coffee house to visit a friend, then lunhc with another friend, and dinner with one of my friends. At some point, we'll clean up so we can have drinks here. Then tomorrow, potluck, play, music, and oscars!   Man, what a weekend.  I need to find me a good smart lib man that thinks I'm hot and is available.

Dude, that talk is so fucking standard in ANY media kit that I might put up my own list  When speaking, annunciate.  Have an idea of what you want to say, then say it  Man, that’s some libo-commi-bullshit if I ever heard it!   Shut up.  Damn.  The whole “don’t show doubt” bit is because of the public’s ignorance about science and scientific inquiry. They grow up with a false belief that science is accurate and true and without bias, and that’s why you can trust it. But it is biased, it always has been biased, and is what we as a society have generally decided to use as a measure of standards.  But people are inherently suspicious, so if we say, well, there’s bias, people start screaming form the rafters that science is wrong and we can’t trust results.  People are wrong too, there are all sorts of uncertainties and unknowns and you should just get the fuck over it.

      Education is not a right on the individual level.  On the social/community level, education is a responsibility.  Educated workers get better jobs, buy more things, and better fuel the economy.  Putting money into a broken machine does not make it work better, and giving more money to schools doesn’t fix the US education system either.  We need to fix the machine. One, students need to learn, need to desire education.  Why don’t we toss out the ones who don’t want to learn and let them fend for themselves?  No government programs if you’re not educated (mandatory testing to receive benefits, same as the GED).  No one is guaranteed work or a job or a place to live.  You must earn these too (I’m not the bleeding heart socialist you though I was, huh?).  Back to education, parents have a responsibility to be active in their child’s education.  If people actually gave a damn, we could kill the kids if parents weren’t willing to take care of them, but those not willing to care and become involved wouldn’t be disturbed. Other people would, but it’s not their kid.  So, I say kill those who make babies and then just don’t give a fuck. And if you fuck around, make babies, don’t want to get killed and then kill them to avoid getting in trouble, we’ll torture you then kill you, then drag your body through the streets and toss it in a heap for the rats and birds.  See, when you’re soft on people, they take advantage of you. If you’re too nice to some people, they abuse the system. There are a lot of abusers out there. A lot of people who feel entitled to all the things they have or should have.  People aren’t entitled to anything more than the flesh on their bodies and the food, water, and air they can suck up.  Beyond that, everything, I do mean EVERYTHING, is a privilege, a luxury, and you should thank God or whomever you see as the great giver (gov’t, dumb luck, earth) for all that you have.  If every nation is a machine, and we cogs in the machine, sometimes, you have to change how the cogs work to get it to function properly.  That’s what I propose.  And that’s just for education.

      Anybody in Carolina?  Go see WIT and  urlLink these other fine groups  at DSI.  And while we’re at it, if you happen to have an old theater in Washington, DC you want to get rid of, WIT would love to have it.  Ok, if it’s new we’d be interested too.  Email me and I’ll let you know in more detail what we need.    There are lots of theater seats in this town, yes, I know.  And there are plenty of places to rent from, er, not plenty because then it would be easy to find a spot. Sure, we enjoy renting the spaces we currently use, but lots of groups are looking to use those spaces. It’s quite a challenge to find the right size and location and time slot available.  Many other theaters are either too big or own their place and so fill it with their shows, which is kinda what we’d like to do, ‘cept for improvisational theater.  There are no full time improvisational theater seats in Washington DC (there are a few outside in NoVA).  That’s sad.    Here, look at these groups to get a sense of what WIT is trying to accomplish in our Nation’s capital (and all the cool things we COULD do!):    urlLink Unexpected Productions    urlLink The PIT    urlLink Improv Olympic   urlLink The Playground    urlLink Upright Citizens Brigade    urlLink Jet City Improv    urlLink BATS Improv   urlLink Improv Boston    urlLink This  is where the last show came from and shows some of the awesome places improv can go when given a good home.   urlLink This  is what happens when you have multiple good homes and  urlLink a little love .

      Interesting, especially the  urlLink last bit .    Also, read  urlLink this bit .   urlLink They  need to read about  urlLink this .  On gay marriages, well, this one’s tough since everyone’s throwing around different arguments.  What is marriage? Sure, there’s the religious side, but let’s face it, it’s been around longer as a legal property system than any affirmation of love in God’s eyes or commitment.    We’re dealing with legal issues here, from inheritance to taxes, legal status, hospital visitation and a slew of other rights and issues.  So should we allow any two people marry?  OK, there’s a no on that. People limit what age you can marry, as well as how many people you can marry at a time. So we do have limits. I’m pretty sure you can’t marry anyone related to you either.  But we say to limit marriages based on racial or ethnic backgrounds is wrong, an unjust limitation of the law.  Where do we want to place homosexual marriage then? In the category of incest, polygamoy, and age or in ethnicity, racial, and religious terms?  Once you’ve decided where it fits, then you can argue yes or no.    Yet these are two separate places, beyond the definitions of “harm” one might argue if a 14 year old want to marry an 18 year old. That’s illegal too, but they might truly love each other. Guess what?  The 14 year old will eventually turn 18, and have the right to marry.  I don’t think we can wait around for gays to go “straight.”    Hmm, another thought, how do we keep random people from marrying each other simply to gain particular benefits such as health insurance or citizenship? Well, heterosexuals commit fraud too, so whatever we do to keep an eye out for that, there you go.  I say let it happen. We’ve turned marriage into an institution of love and legal rights, neither of which can be denied to people.

      I'm back from the west coast. fun times.  Upon all this moblization and seeing and talking to people, I'm beginning to have doubts: will I ever find myself in a relationship? Am I lovable? Do I even have a shot of coexisting with another person, ever?  I keep finding myself at a distance, and it just sucks. Am I bound to never even find someone who'd be worthy of love?  Someone worthy of commitmement?    I don't even have the 'run around and fuck people' thing going on so i'm not building any sort of resume for sex or people.  I have the shortest of sex and relationship resumes, and no apparent hope of ever getting a 'good job' (I realize the double entendre, though not my intention).  I feel so utterly lost and alone, despite my friends (the good ones aren't near/around enough, and those nearby aren't emotionally close enough to provide the support I need).  I'm going to end up an old maid, that weird old lady that scares little children and townsfolk tell stories about.  Damn it.

      Watching 60 minutes last night, now one of my favored programs for its story coverage, featured a  urlLink piece on Evangelicals  .  Now is it just me, or do they sound like the siblings of Scientologists; a cultish style religion that professes bizarreness as normalcy?  Anyone sitting eagerly in wait of their existence being snuffed out in an instance has something loose.  An entire best selling series of books about the end of the world, and well, read the interviews yourself and see what I’m talking about.  Patrol in the Sunni triangle’s also great, for its take on perspectives and the problems with communication, despite safety nets.  Also on the 60 minutes site.  The DC Neutrino project’s off and rolling. My best friend came down to watch and now plans on seeing the original in NYC.  I must say Greyhound has a fantastic deal for traveling between NYC and DC, and the Chinatown buses are even cheaper.  I need to start taking advantage of this. Ha, I need to stop going out and save money so I can start doing this.  Give a gold star to anyone that comes to visit you like my friend did.  It’s made this week more tolerable already.  Another good story which should be up in a few hours on “Framing” political arguments was on All Things Considered on  urlLink NPR .

What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  Dating someone they don’t approve of?  There’s hardly a thing I could do that wouldn’t be approved, everyone’s pretty open and accepting of what I do. Other than something really stupid and illegal, which I don’t have any particular desire to break the law or be stupid.  3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) 3  4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? Opportunities in radio, improv and life  5. ... and what's the worst? The photographs and photocopies that people have stored away.  For your reading  urlLink pleasure .

      Edwards is not a used cars salesman.  He’s a televangelist.  Please remember this, as his campaign is about to collapse. It’s what happens when you stick to your guns and go the moral high road.  Dean on Meet the Press, was fantastic, he said what I’ve been waiting to hear in the media, a straight up talker saying what he knows and not what we want to hear.  Also in trouble.    I’m in trouble too.  Month of August trouble.  How to relate: there was a little spider running on my work paper.  I killed it, and now feel horribly guilty for smashing it, even though I don’t like it and probably would have smashed it anyway (If I was feeling giving, I would have tossed it into the hall to fend for itself). Horribly guilty: I’ve torn at the fabric of existence, ripping my soul.  I may go home early today and try to relax.  I need to go home. Eek.

      The Cardiac cats struck again, pummeling, fighting, scratching, and this time, sadly, losing.  So any what-ifs, but they weren’t, so it’s time to get over it and enjoy the distance we’ve come and hope that we can remain together enough to come again next year,  urlLink make the ride  and rise again.  Plenty to read about my poor boos.  I went down to Carolina to watch the game with family and friends.  Muy divertida.  Despite the lack of football knowledge in the group, by the end we had everyone jumping up and down screaming.  I was hoarse for a bit after that too, yelling and cursing and jumping up and down.  So very lively, so very fun.  By the end of it all, I was ready for bed.  Not for me though, I got ride the train all night long, with the light from the aisle blaring in my eyes and at least two major snorers gurgling and gargling through the night.  I eventually took my bandana and put it over my eyes, then snuggled into my turtles neck and took an antihistamine to help me sleep.  Stupidly though, it dried me out even more than before, so I’m currently trying to rehydrate my sinuses and mouth.  I’m at work though! 10 AM on the dot.   Oh, and I got to see JJ’s boob.  MTV, NFL, never to be together again.  I like that they claim it’s an accident. Uh-huh.  I’m exhausted. I need a nap. Oh, and I’m supposed to go two different places tonight. Sheesh.

      Man, my head hurts.  Like it was run over with a truck. Ouch. Maybe a cold coming on. Maybe a heater, fan, and cigarette smoke blowing at me for two hours last night.  Well, socialized at Dr Dremos.  Semi-good times.  I'm little miss moody this month (at least) so the best I can say is some stuff was OK.  At some point, things will be better, but until then, I really want to cocoon away in my apartment (especially with this cold snap). Hey, it beats the fires of heck that heated my office last week, that's for sure!  Oh, there's something! I met someone who knows mollx's girl. Knew each other in San Francisco.    Very sleepy after eating...must get back to work.  One day at a time

      It is so FUCKING hot in here. I want to scream.  Windows and door open, fan on, and the fucking furnace is blasting away at 80.  I'm in short sleeves and a skirt.  It's like having a giant breathing on you, minus the bad breathe.  A couple of interesting articles on  urlLink childhood  and on those  urlLink cave explorers  in Mexico. Two things to gleam: education does not need any more money. We need to learn how to utilize our resources instead.  Same goes for a lot of programs really. We’re inefficient and wasteful.  Second, it’ll be funny if those cavers were on a reconnaissance mission.  Must go to the pet store soon.  Just a personal note.  Yay for  urlLink liberal media .    urlLink This is cute  Dean thing, not Bush. I can't get it to go directly right now.  And  urlLink these guys , well, if you expect quality, you’ll demand it, and you’ll get it.  DC needs to start respecting itself and not settling for crap and inefficiency.  And the Unions, if they’re raising costs and cutting into time worked, well, DC, go another route. Sacrilege yes, but guess what people, higher wages and better lives for workers means the cost of goods go up.  You got to decide what you want.  You can’t have both. Oh, and don’t abuse the privilege, which is what I think’s happening with some groups.

      Hey, I'm back from vacation!  Yay.  Now back on the train of life.  Watched it  urlLink last night , but won't go buy the book.  Of course, I'm looking for evidence he's an ass, so I like to hear how he surrounded himself with asses.  And the claim (not mentioned here, but in the interview) that Rummy et al were focused on cold war era stuff, those accusation have been made before, earlier, by others.  We need new leadership. This group, sadly, isn' all smoke and mirrors: they also have bombs.    Oh, and I'm following the crowd here: We need to eliminate the source of the problem, not simply its symbols.  Bin Laden makes the public happy, but it won't do a damn thing to make us more secure if he's brought to justice.  It's a comforting falsehood that we need to collectively ditch. We need to accept the fact that we have entire warehouses of stuff available to us because of who we put down, who we take away from. You can't have something for nothing, and it's not all a money-goods exchange system either.  I ain't saying to ditch our lifestyles (people see that as an attack at hoarding as if hording and growing huge are traits to be proud of), just learn the truth, and THEN make your decisions. Maybe the US education system is inefficient on purpose. I think most people would be morally disgusted if they realized what all goes into creating their lifestyles. Ignorance is bliss.  Onto the weirdness of DC and the culture shock of home at a later time.

      We live in a consumer based society, one which should not be beholden to government regulations.  A toxic food environment? Well, it’s not the government’s fault we’re lazy and eating crap. We have to make the decision, personally, that we don’t want crap, and you know what happens?  Marketers and suppliers, the other force at work in our economic system, respond. Look at all the new low carb high protein foods out there, the shift towards semi-healthier materials for our consumption.  It can work.  The only area where government should play a role is a)education, but of course, people will ignore unpleasantness for pleasures regularly, and b)in the health versus junk food divide.   I’m not sure how this can be handled, but the cheaper and/or quicker foods are on average absolute crap.  Organic, healthy, fresh food is overpriced and expensive, a luxury item. Luxury to be healthy, default to obesity.  It’s a cultural change that we need, one towards personal responsibility and one with a lot less guilt about “traumatizing” our children by actually giving them some structure in their lives and actually being present to raise and take care of them. But that’s another subject for another day.   urlLink Fantastic : "Americans need to understand that overweight and obesity are literally killing us," said Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.  Later in the article, “I don't want to start banning things," Thompson said. "Prohibition has never worked." Ah, should we bring up the “War on Drugs” then?  Haha.  Why can’t our lawmakers  urlLink respond  similarly?   urlLink Nature .  Ya got to love it.    So, life continues.  Still want to hide and still haven't drunk myself into a stupor, binged, or starved myself.  Well, OK, I could never starve myself.  I get bored too often ;)  I've discovered once more I've underestimated people, and that person a mirrors person b on another occasion.  Points to them for that, plus the general parrallels of the a and b's existence and behaviors in my life.

       ONE , this will be fun...  urlLink LIVE DISCUSSION: THE WHITE HOUSE AND SCIENCE POLICY   Join a live, online discussion with John H. Marburger III, President Bush's chief scientific adviser, about criticism from prominent scientists that the White House has manipulated or ignored research findings in order to further its political goals, on Friday at 1 p.m., U.S. Eastern time. SEE http://chronicle.com/colloquylive/2004/03/science/    TWO:  This came in recently.  Very odd. Don't worry, nothing was attached and I wouldn't open one anyway.  I changed info around too to keep their identity private.  My name is Person, I live in New York, and my child is a biologist.   The Mars rover expedition has certainly generated a lot of excitement in our community.  It is the subject of this note.   The Mars team consists of mainly geologists and engineers.  I do not believe they have any biologists on the official team, as they were not expecting to find any life there, therefore they are disregarding any evidence of such in their official findings.   While conducting the Washington, DC presentation, they even had someone pressuring them to use the word "habitat" when discussing the rock formations they had found.  Squyres was very reluctant to use the term at all, given that this a geological investigation.   One thing is very disturbing about the way in which the Mars project is being handled.  Immediate reference was made to bringing samples back to Earth to more thoroughly examine them.  This could present a serious problem.  They have found some evidence of biological activity, and have no way of knowing if that biology is still active.  They do know that something created a woven, or knitted pattern in the soils and rocks.  They are referring to it as "cross-bedding".  They have also made comments about a corkscrew shaped "something" that they've found.  They called it "rotini" shaped.  Such an organism, when linked together, would naturally form knitted patterns.   From their own photos the Mars team have uncovered a wealth of information.  One thing is pretty clear, that some life form created this knitted pattern everywhere we are looking.  The surface crust appears to be knitted, the layering of the "bedrock" also appears to be knitted.  My own child is a biologist, and to use his own words, "If there ever was life on Mars, it's probably still there".     Which brings me to my point.  I have attached a couple of pictures from the Mars exploration to illustrate my case for you.  If there is a life form busily knitting the surface of Mars, possibly a form adapted to retain the moisture remaining there, and if the tiniest amount arrives at Earth  by one of NASA'a "mishaps", and if said organism can possibly survive the Earth's atmosphere, we will be up to our hips in knitting in very short order.   The problem is that we have no way of knowing what would happen, and nobody should be bringing any kind of samples of anything back from Mars until we know with absolute certainty that doing so would present no danger whatsoever the the environment of our planet.  The problem here is that these geologists and NASA are positively rabid to get some of the Martian material to Earth for further study.  The issue is not one of intent, it is merely one of unintentional microscopic transport of an organism which is very hard to spot, and about which we know nothing.   The team has admitted to finding threads all over, which they are attributing to the landing balloons.  This is clearly not a scientific finding, and any assumptions and decisions based upon such assumptions must be immediately be placed under investigation and censure.  This is a scientific exploration, and not an egocentric game, which line has become exceedingly blurry during this activity.  I sincerely hope that the scientific community has the wits to come to the fore to prevent a disaster before it occurs.  Otherwise, we may be looking at the scorecard "Mars 2 - Earth 0" before we know it.  I pray that they haven't already done something very stupid.    Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.   Sincerely, Person  Strange, no?  It still doesn't beat the cryptic letter we recieved last year with latitude and longitude coordinates to someone's DNA for cloning.

      Bush's spokes lady (for the campaign I think) just stated that "maybe the Democrats don't want America to remember September 11th" and the good job Bush has done.  WHAT!?  She just started it.  Started the words that spread hate and lead to deep seeded conflicts like those in Northern Ireland and Palestine.  Her statement goes beyond mudslinging, it's hate mongering.  I am appalled.  (Listen to NPR news at the top of the hour. They may play the clip again.

       urlLink Crazy  about that kid   urlLink Novel About Nazi Pornography Scandalizes German Literati . This also seems appealing, but I doubt there will be any translations into English anytime soon.  For those without access to the Times, it’s once fucked up book that’s pissing people off.  Maybe it’s well written, maybe not, but of course, anytime you deal with Nazis, you must say negative things. You can’t make everyone bad and immoral, even if we all really are. To the victor goes the truth.    Guess I’m in a good mood today   You are Form 0,  Phoenix : The Eternal.   "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal."   Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun.  As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual.  You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations.  You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Screened Kitchen Stories last night over at the Cinema.  While it’s a nice, quiet movie, the audience stunk.  Some people laughed simply to laugh it seems, maybe an old memory being jogged here or there, and maybe I was just too uptight, but the laughs didn’t hit with the rhythm of the movie for the first hour.  I’m not trying to dictate comedic sense to people, its just a lot of things coming from the audience didn’t feel correct.  Odd.    Its hard to believe that free makes people more possessive and greedy, but it does.  I’ve never seen (this is a blanket overstatement, but bear with me) such seat wrangling, rushing, and tense nerves before.  Just ruined the entire expanse of the film, which is itself very slow, stark, and lonely (in a happy way up north way, not miserable).  Ah, it was like finding a crowd in a desert, after you spent hours walking to get away from everyone.    Anyway, while standing in line I thought, I’ve found a better way to see movies! Now I know, if I really want to see AND enjoy a film, I’d better plop down the money.  When we spend, oddly enough, we have more respect for each other and the seats.  Go figure.

      I am tired.  60 hours, multiple events, several hours, and only a quarter of that devoted to sleep.  Guess it's better than too much work, but still, I can't wait to get some sleep.  As you saw, late night Friday, late night Saturday and Sunday, busy too.  We skipped out on teh MHC event sicne we didn't get back to my palce till close to noon.  We followed it up by ordering pizza. But they were out of chicken. So we decided to try goat cheese. We needed a meat: bacon.  20 minutes later they called. No bacon.  We did sausage instead.  It was actually good.    Then we ran to pck up Noah and see some friends in a children's play at an area church. VERY 1970's.  A few key messages: divorce is good because your family multiplies, sibilings are good to have becuase otherwsie you get lonely (and if you're an only child, don't worry, your friends can come break your blocks and help you with homework), boys can play with dolls b/c it'll make into good fathers, and babies, while they know nothing b/c they're babies by thier own admission, magically have the gift to understand gender sterotypes and human anatomy well enough to see you can't judge a book by its cover.  Yeah.  Just put these to songs and you'll have hours of material.  Then we met up with the KC posse to hear Bobby mcFerrin for free at the Kennedy Center. We got there early enough to get light-up yo-yos.  Cool.  Next, we ran over to G'town for dinner, which turned out a mess, but thanks to a determined accomplice we got for free (perfectionists can be quite useful when they're not statisfied).  Then the Oscars, which were boring and slow and long, but pretty.  Oh, I'm heading back to NC and VA mid-March for a much needed break. I'm very excited.  Dang, as an introvert, I'm exhausted.  People for 60 hours.  Need. Break. Sleep. Soon. Yay :)

      Mister, you were so far gone.  I hope you didn’t have a big meeting or presentation today. Sure, you’re having a good time. But man, I don’t even want to imagine the hangover you have at this moment.  You couldn’t even talk half the time you were so far gone. One idea at a time. And ripping off your shirt at FrontPage? Not exactly the best venue.   Well, they didn’t kick you out, amazingly. I still don’t understand why you wanted to punch strangers. Props to you for not falling flat on your ass.

      One of those email forwards…Hopefully it’s all accurate but then again, it’s the overarching theme that matters:  Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality, who dispenses advice to  People who call in to her Radio show. On her radio show recently, she said  that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination, according  to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, penned by a US  resident, which was posted on the Internet. ****************************************** Dear Dr. Laura: Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination ... End of debate.  I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them.  1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and  female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.  Can you  clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?  2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in  Exodus 21:7.  In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24.  The problem is how do I tell?  I have tried asking, but most women take offense.  4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is, my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?  5.  I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath.  Exodus  35:2. clearly states he should be put to death.  Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?  6.  A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree.  Can you settle this?  Are there 'degrees' of abomination?  7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight.  I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.  Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?  8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?  9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?  10. My uncle has a farm.  He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend).  He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot.  Is it really necessary that we go to all the  trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16.   Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws?  (Lev. 20:14)  I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.  Your adoring fan Homer Simpson-Caldwell

      Been a while.  Been busy.  Marched at the Protest Sunday, the end to a very long 48 hours of improv, parties, movies, dates, and walking. Lots of walking.  I'm noteven close to what I usually cover for a summertime weekend, but it's been so long I'm still getting back in teh swing of things. That, and overstretched muscles form dancing Friday night. Feet are fine, but the legs, well, they'll forgive me sometime.    Apathy creeping up on me. Mostly becuase I'm tired. I passed out last night when I got home.  I managed to eat all of about four meals (Friday dinner was solid, and I think there was a sandwich in there somewhere later).  Mostly snacking when I found myself stopping for a bit.    Ran into three of my fellow mates from jury duty Yesterday.  Odd to run into one, odder to find more at another locale.  Small town.  Need some sleep.  Man, I'm a lazy spoiled ass.  But if you spoil me, I do good things in return :) Yeah, no point in trying.  Oh well.  Did have fun dancing. Drunk dancing, but fun.  I am so close to doing something irresponsible. It's only a matter of time. Hm, I just better be careful that it doens't launch me into a long stretch of foolishness. Because I'd really like to go there.

The actua trial shouldn't be that interesting, but at least it's a change of pace. Yay.  Brain: sleep-deprived. Or Water deprived.    My Goodness that was a load of liqour in those two drinks.  I've never had so much fun riding on the metro. Really good fun.  I had to stop though b/c the fun started to border on queasy, and the thought of being ill wasn't a pleasant one. Did not get sick, and manged to get my contacts out. Why I decide when I'm this drunk to sleep naked, I don't know. Why I like to use a pillow as a blanket perplexes me even more (in addition to the sheets). But man, you wake up so happy! Definitely sloshed.  We took a friend home who didn't fare as well, but she should be ok this morning. Poor thing.  Feel the love people! I am a happy, happy, happy drunk.  Lots going on still; shows, movies, parties, etc. Probably cool it a bit tonight then party crazy Saturday with Kill Bill Vol. 2!  I'm thinking about the zoo too.  Oh, and work on the improv projects continues.  I love this line of work.  Saw a cute boy at the coatcheck at the National Gallery's entrance near the DC courthouse.    Got to sit in the sculpture garden on a beautiful day, and had one full hour for lunch  Me like goodness. Yay :)

      I’m on the edge of a vast canyon, looking out into the abyss. The sand and earth stretch for miles into the light, the bright blue sky casting shadows into the ravine. A cool breeze blows up from below, shattering as it’s overcome by the heat. My body lies down, tempted no more by the sweet air.  As the air passes out of me shadow sweeps by and grabs hold of my soul, sending it lofting into the heavens, out into the desert, alone.  Sometimes you are so low, you're high. Feel it. ( And while I hate to break the melencholy of this moment, no, I'm not going to jump or do anything stupid. It's just a moment in time, a reflection of the greater self).

      Visted Mass this weekend and saw the old gals do their thing. There are some good groups up there, I must say. But my old buds, while I love y'all to bits, need some work, whether you want to be doing comedy games or comedy theater.  I'd say more, but that would be rude in such a public place, especially since I don't have to deal with any of the internal politics and issues that could be affecting them.  Get outside help y'all.  An independent perspective. Please.  So the people I saw were fantastic. Many thanks to my friends. I needed those hugs so very much.  Of course, back here I'm unhappy again, and would be totally directionless except for this current improv project that consumes my thoughts. I adore it. I wish I could just be a recruiter and go around to campuses and troupes gathering talent for shows and networking improvisers. I'd be a very happy woman. I like people, I like networking and I love to tell people about about awesome things that can make them happy.   Anyone like to offer me a new career? Yeah, wishful thinking.  So much stress. I won't even delve into world topics since my edge, while the edge of someone with too much time on their hands, is still an edge. I had a dream last night about people attaching nuclear bombs to cattle and then exploding them, the black flesh flying out from the doorways followed by the bright light of atomic energy.  Yeah, impossible, the light would come before the matter, but still bothersome.

      Like midmorning, except without the tiredness. So much going on, I don't know where to start. New troop, new network, an entire world is forming and the thoughts that go through your head, even when you're not the creator, are astounding.    Maybe this will all fall through, maybe it's too much, but I think not. I think it will be born. Whether it is the ugly duckling or cinderella, we'll have to wait and see...things are moving, and the mind moves with it.  Sleep will not come soon. I'll be lucky to function tomorrow at work.  Oh, this is what I've thought about, a bit, not this well done, but similar, but have never seen it come to be.  This may be the spark we need to ignite the community!  Onward improv!

      I hear a voice again, my muse returned. She drops her luggage on the floor next to the light table, out in the hallway.  She huffs a bit as she drops them, as if burdened by the sheer effort of letting go.  Her boa flaps about her neck as the light steams in from the large glass doorway, summer air creeps at the windows, trying to crawl in. A red carpet on the floor begs for company, the absence of the house so overwhelming.  She plops herself onto a chair and moves her hands as if holding a cigarette and chatting to the latest partygoer. It’s 1920 by her book.  The train ride was such a bore she thinks to herlef. You should have seen the décor – atrocious!  Well of course not. A lady has to travel sometime. True true. Yes. Oh, you are a doll.  The house still sits empty, quiet. She’s fallen asleep.

      I feel like I'm wrapped in a warm blanket, all cozy and snuggly.  Sometimes the sudden absence of pain is the best feeling in the world.  I know I'm better because the rain's making me happy.  Think of Seattle, think of being away up in the mountains in the spring, so high up that it's still chilly, and the mist coming down like condensation off of angels' wings.  Look at the earth, covered in man's creation of road, and see how it undulates across the chaos of our organization.  The splashing water like a child playing in a puddle. The droplets hitting, departing, and collecting, forming small lakes and rivers. The world recreated in our asphalt. the world forming again, and again, with every drop.  Breathe deep, and live again.

      Amusement for you:  1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: “The Party interfered in everything, from his thinking and his writing to his private life.”  2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first? A printed email regarding a report coming out today.  3. What is the last thing you watched on TV? purposefully? Local Fox morning News.   4: WITHOUT LOOKING: huh? 10:20?  5: Now look at the clock; what is the actual time? 11:41  6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? Mix 107.3, the din of traffic, a bus, ac vents and my typing.  7. When did you last step outside? What were you doing? On my way to work, I was outside. Gathered food for lunch in the process.  8. Before you came to this Web site, what did you look at? my own blog (where most my links at). Wait, this is on my blog now. The American Idol stuff (Yay Fantasia!).  9. What are you wearing? Knee length beige dress, glasses, tevas  10. Did you dream last night? Haha, yes, I dreamt I was wandering around DC in search of improv class, being followed by a homeless man who wanted to sleep with me, cut down a fence near a creek bank to leave the abandoned house where the guy and some other friends had taken up staying in, looked for a metro entrance, wandered upon clothing store in an old house, which had a XXX section, which lead to me shopping for a dildo at a place with better selection.  11. When did you last laugh? Phony laugh this morning as I try to sound jovial with coworkers.  12. What is on the walls of the room you are in? In front of me: Bulletin board, calendar, far side cartoons, publication schedule, AAAS poster. To my left,  metal mobil gas sign with a red winged horse, postcard, two old cards, a primitive reproduction of a shark drawing, a horse shoe over the door, and several post-it notes detailing my whereabouts. Behind me: another, smaller bulletin board, an NASW membership certificate, and an experts database reference page. To my right: it’s a window, so that doesn’t count.  13: Seen anything weird lately? Smooshed cicada bodies, half eaten cicada carcasses, a website saying “Bush is Lord,” and an unattractive nymphomaniac with the bloody “favorite bits” from her lover whom she accidentally strangled while having sex (movie, not news).  14: What is the last film you saw? In the Realm of the Senses  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first? Insurance.  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know. That depends on who “you” are. Contact me if you really want to know.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do? I’d make people have enough fucking sense that stupid actions/behaviors/etc would be highly reduced.  19: Do you like to dance? Yes.  20: George Bush: is he really doing Dick Cheney? Good grief no. Cheney’s frigid.  21a: Imagine your first child is a girl. What do you call her? Catherine  21b: Imagine your first child is a boy. What do you call him? Tod  22: Would you ever consider living abroad? Yes.

Visit  urlLink Reuters  or  urlLink Fox News  this morning with their lovely map of the US and a shooters target on it.  You can do so much with fear. Like pass legislation, move agendas, and maintain the status quo power structure.  Kinda like Stalin's USSR, Nazi Germany, Burma's military Junta, or China's Cultural Revolution and Communist government.  Nah, we ain't that bad. Yet.

      If memory holds correct, half of the first-years from our dorm came to Reunion: Me, Jyot, Anna, Katie C, Molly H, Molly M, and Gretchen.  Pretty cool. Ran into some other faves as well, from ’03, and saw a few of the ‘04ers that I knew graduate.  What an exhausting weekend!  So glad I saw who I did. So glad Laura brought in that bottle of rum and Anna and I danced like fools. So glad when I left to go back to the apt that I laid in the grass listening to the silence of the college and took advantage of an empty street to lay down in the middle of that as well. I love temporary silence. No traffic, no sirens, no planes, or mowers, or engines. Just the world. Sleeping.

      Nope, still haven't read the book. Did see the next best thing though:  urlLink Super Size Me . Not a "must see in theaters" but definitely worth seeing whether from home on DVD (when it comes out) or at your local theater when/if it comes to town.  A very palatable documentary.   Hopefully it will also cause you to loose your apetite and swear yourself to home cooking and a new diet, if you're not one of the few still making everything from scratch.   I now have half a chocolate cake to unload.  I've got one of those bruises that looks like a cut, but of course, being a bruise, it didn't break the skin. My other index finger started hurting in sympathy with it.  Silly brain synapses.  Boy is going to NYC with me next weekend.  I like him, he likes me. Makes the whole dating thing pleasant.

      Nothing's set yet, but initial reaction to my invitation was positive.  This means a)I will be in NYC May 29 and 30 and b)boy may also be present.  Eeek and yay.   I don't know what I'm thinking, other than I'm out of town for the next two weekends and I'd like to spend a bit of time with him.  I barely invite my friends along for trips.  Oddness. Anyway, still not settled yet. I don't want the boy pressured into coming or anything.   So if you're there in NYC, and want to hang out, let me know.  I'm/we're staying with Jyot. Yay Jyot!  Also, hitting Boston the 30th and 31st, no boy.  MHC this weekend. Reunion of course. Finally found a white outfit after an entire mall and two seperate stores downtown.  At least white's in and abundant in the spring.  Other musings? Forgot how lovely it is to be the first in the office. Sadly, more poeple are on the 8 AM shift, so the only way I can get my much desired solitude is to get in around 7 or hang around until after 6:30.  Neither is quite appealing. Although there's something to be said for a 7:30 - 4 workday. It's not an option.

      Class last night went well. We lost two and gained two, and I discovered three of the people are in a new group starting in Baltimore.  Work focused on emotions, from levels to sounds. Overall good exercises. What’s so bizarre is seeing the less experienced students thinking so much and holding back (although I’m guilty of that as well, but hopefully in a different way).  One player continues to do some similar types, but they know how to play around and play the game. Saw some excellent work, and examples of why high emotional states and reactions are so much better for the audience.  Not as happy with this new ensemble, but still decent.  The other team’s now got a set day of the week for rehearsal, and hopefully a locale too. Still compiling all the greatness of the new site, which will hopefully be up and running in the next couple of weeks.  Other news? Heading north for reunion. Maybe some drinking tonight, but i still need some white pants darn it! Still stressed with work, in that, "oh goodness me I don't want to do this I think I'll have a meltdown instead way." Why do I fear doing a good job so much?  It's OK to be succesful. Really. And you don't have to crash after happiness either. Humbug.

      I dreamed I went to  urlLink Virginia , to a  urlLink farmhouse , to visit for a bit, when Friday came around and I had to go to work. I got in the car and drove to Richmond instead, putting myself farther off, to visit my college. I snuck into one for the dorms with my old key, in an attempt to find the free bins and grab a clean shirt to wear to work. I had to not get caught by the kitchen staff, and there was a toilet in the dining area that I used, right before people were  urlLink sitting down  to an early breakfast (I could have used the one in the kitchen, but I was in a hurry). So most of the time there spent sneaking around trying not to get caught for trespassing (and I don’t remember ever locating a shirt to wear), running into friends and then horrifyingly seeing it was 8:30am and I was five hours from work. Decided I should call it a day. And we were getting pizza today too! I wake up and, ok, it’s only 8, and I’m twenty minutes away from work. Good.  Last night, viewed more of the  urlLink 48 hour film project . Overall I say group A was better than group C. C had lots of cool credits and editing techniques, but very few well established pieces. I was disappointed with WIT’s horror entry. They once again went for a thriller, which wasn’t so thrilling, and added a bit of “lost in translation” aimlessness. People liked the twist, so hopefully it’ll survive into the “best of” show. Last year’s piece was better.  Hate that it was late too, since at least the acting was decent.  Most of the other films, well, I can’t even remember which one was actually the best for the evening.  I just remember a few choice bad ones that made me uncomfortable, including a lovely  urlLink stereotyped -casting job that CBS probably would tolerate (cop drama).  Had the boy meet the friends, and met up with some other folk as well, and worlds seemed to mesh fairly well.  So that’s good.  Overall a good evening, especially hanging out with the most of the posse. It’d been a good week since we’d hung out and oddly enough I missed them.  That’s probably good too.  Yes, lots of political stuff, and no, I’m not touching it. It’s everywhere, people are discussing and debating, and personally I’m taking my privileged little white ass and hiding from it all as much as possible.  urlLink Cicadas , now that’s a news story...

      First class down y'all.  Good goin' with Leah for a prof. I'm already a step ahead of where I've been stalled for months.  I forgot how great a new group is, especially fresh blood from Foundations.    The new location, albeit a bit out of the way from earlier locales, is far superior.  Me like school classrooms in basements. They have A/C!   Four girls, six guys, and good energy. It's entirely too cute to see newbies being newbies.    I've figured a mantra for classes: failure is my only option.  It's brilliantly fanatastic to aim to fail b/c all the pressures off to do well and you don't give a hoot what you're doing; you just do it.  Now, mind you, if you're brain's not like mine and/or you have different issues, this mantra probably ain't for you.  To each his own.

      What a weekend.  So tense Saturday for the meeting and party my jaw managed to stay locked until about 3 in the afternoon Sunday.  Sheesh.  Well, the meeting for Scriptless went well, so no worries there. Got ready for the party, which was way out in Maryland, away from the metro, with a bunch of people I didn’t know and a guy I’ve gone out with a couple of times whom I met online.  Eeek.     Point one: I’m here typing, therefore I’m still alive.   Little paranoid me had already figured out how far the metros were in case I found myself stranded and wanting to go home.  The boy secured a car early on, and we hit a drive though liquor store to supply some booze.  He didn’t drink heavily the whole night, and was completely sober when it was time to drive.   Point two: Who you surround yourself with speaks to your character  His friends were all sweet, nice, normal, and smart.   Point three: Certain groups are better partiers  The “monkeys” hosted the event. Apparently party-throwers for several years now and they have it down to an art. The house itself is fantastic. Probably close to 100 people attended the event, although groups came and went throughout the night.  There were people not drinking, youngins’ not drinking, random folk who probably wandered off the street, friends of friends, siblings, and an entire amalgamation of people who they’ve met over the years.  Overall friendly, sociable, and entertaining.   Point four: some traditions are worth keeping  At one point I found myself conversing with the boy and two other guys on Chomsky, neural pathways, reality, and perception. The guys were shirtless. Sadly, not everyone was as a traditionalist and some said they’d need more liquor first. Huh? Dudes, it’s not as if we’re asking y’all to strip naked.   Sunday   Slept most of the day, then ran over to Visions to catch the Oscar Shorts.  They would have been better, but one guy in the audience was your stereotypical annoying movie-goer, complete with food from the outside, plastic bags, popping bottles, shoes off, up and down a lot, talking, personal comments, and yes, his cell phone going off and him apologizing to the patrons. Passive-attention behavior.   Saw survivor as well. This is why  improvising  is so fantastic. Those people , their behaviors and reactions, couldn’t have been scripted anywhere near as well as reality.  And improv is that one step in between reality and script (so all the drama without the real world consequences).

      Another night of excessive drinking.  This time it was a duo out barhopping in Eastern Market.  I found out where Tunicliffs is finally, a place I've passed by for ages not really noticing becuase it was usually 10 in the morning and that's not their big money maker (brunch is though).    Also ran into a friend who warned me about the food at Hawk and Dove. So I ordered fries, figured any germs would be killed with hot grease. And a crappy Margarita. One notch above the stuff in a bucket, but it was cinco de mayo (what is it with Americans turning foriegn holidays into drinking binges?).  We finished off at my favorite pool hall, Zack's.  When we first passed by there was this retro feeling to the place with all these young adults hanging around like some 1950's diner with all the local high schol kids. It was still crowded when we came back by, but there was an open pool tabel and we took it.   Apparently it was deaf night.  Which was fairly cool except for the gaggle of people who didn't understand a damn thing about being in a billiards bar. Move the fuck out of the way (and of course, I'm too polite to start pushing. I missed several shots trying to avoid hitting people). Even if you tapped people on the shoulder to move, they seemed miffed that they had to move.  Sheesh.  Some folk were good, but whoever bitches about people acting right?  Anyway, we owned the joint, er, Kate owned the table.  I beat her once and am finally figuring how to shoot.  Anyway, today, I am very tired. I came in late to work and my head's still floating a bit.  I can't wait to finally eat lunch.  3 AM. That's when we left. Maybe it was 2, but damn that's late.  The bouncer was nice, and most of the people there were nice.  It's a very cool place. A bit of a dive maybe, but friendly, local, and a good atmosphere.  Today, today is beautiful. Last night was pleasant too. So many places looked like bars out on the coast outside of peak season. Think it was something in the air.

       I Am A:  Chaotic Good Elf Druid Ranger    Alignment:   Chaotic Good  characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.    Race:   Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.    Primary Class:   Druids  are a special variety of Cleric who serves the Earth, and can call upon the power in the earth to accomplish their goals. They tend to be somewhat fanatical about defending natural settings.    Secondary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.    Deity:   Rillifane Rallathil  is the Chaotic Good elven god of woodlands and nature. He is also known as the Leaflord, the Wild One, and the Great Oak. He is appears as a huge oak tree. His followers believe that everyone should be free to spend their lives doing what nature has meant them to, and they protect the forests from those who would abuse them. Their preferred weapon is the quarterstaff. Rillifane Rallathil's symbol is an oak tree.

      In the Month of June our workplace has had not one, not two, but four people announce their resignation. I said, or at least thought a few of months ago, that this place was like a sinking ship. Now the rats are jumping off and swimming for shore. I've been thinking similar thoughts myself.   Well, either we'll get a new crew that's inspired and motivated, or I might join them. Of course, I'll need to rearrange my dates again. Or go with when I have good prospects.  Last night, a jazz gig of a friend's, bad sound system, good vocals.  Went with boy and his friends as well as the posse. Rode home with the posse, got stuck in traffic, then we passed boy and his ride. Listened to Beattles music, sang loudly, yelled as boy came running along the side of car, saying "I figured traffic this slow, I might as well jog" and then him falling back two car lengths and hopping into his ride.  he's so cute.

      From a friend of a friend, for your enjoyment:  Hey people,  It is going to be tough writing a letter on this damn German keyboard. The letters are on all the wrong places. Though I am not one to complain about the way German´s do things.  For instance - their metro system. I think it´s the best metro system in the world because it´s free. Well, its not supposed to be. It´s actually two euros per hour. One euro is close to one American dollar. After B and I picked our hostel, we took a bus from the airport to the metro. It was a 2 euro admission charge. (They haven´t put the euro symbol on this keybord yet...perhaps you can find it on microsoft word if you use the insert symbol method...Have they even updated Word since Office 2000. If not then their symbol list is pre-euro) Then when we got to the metro I paid another 2 euros for a ticket before I realized that the ticket I paid for to get on the bus was still good for the metro. Perhaps it´s only in Washington where a metro ticket is transferable to a bus but not vice versa. Although I guess there are still plenty of places that cosider those two modes of tranportation to be two separate entities.  Nobody checks the ticket and there is no gate to slip the ticket through. Since then we have been using the metro to run all over Berlin for free. This Jew in Germany is quite pleased with his free ride. The laugh is on you...Nazi bastards. I´m sure on occasion a guard comes in and checks for tickets. In fact once we passed a stop and there were about four police men and a guard dog there. We got concerned and got off the metro...making a dash towards the exit before the police would ask for a ticket. I looked back and saw the police continue to talk to each other and the dog was wearing a muzzle. It´s a good thing they keep those dogs muzzled. It clearly would be unfair to be mauled by big German dog for riding the metro without a ticket. I imagine they were looking for possible terrorist threats. In fact you can find guards at any Jewish establishment. There were some in front of a synagogue we visited and more in front of the Kosher Beth Cafe. There was an extensive barracade in front of the Beth Cafe.  So after that experience we learned not to fear German police while riding for free on the metro. The metro actually leaves open a good mode of escape if a ticket checker does come in. The cars are all open and there are so many cars that if someone started checking tickets, you could easily space yourself from them and get out at the next stop. We made out like bandits.  We´re now waiting for a train to Poland where we will spend the next couple days staying with B´s Aunt before he goes off to Krakow for his course. I was a little confused about where to buy a ticket when I asked a German woman who directed me to a ticket machine. I had asked her if you were supposed to buy your ticket on the train or before. She seaid that if you bought it on the train you may (note: may) have to pay extra. Perhaps we have just uncovered the best kept secret of travel in Europe. It´s free! We did buy tickets but I´ll let you know if anyone checks.  Also, the toilet in the Berlin airport had a large square that you push down to flush. It also had an option to push up to stop. I spent several minutes flushing the toilet and watching it stop at my command before I let it go for a long full flush. This is a really good idea for people who frequently loose their wedding band while wiping their bottom.  Berlin is a rather busy city. It felt much like being in Brooklyn except everone speaks German. We spent last night hopping various venues and watching people do what they do. One such place was the Tobasco bar, where a croud sat and drank making no other motions except to repeatedly walk in and out of the bar. There was a majority of older men but a significant minority of young fellows. This is not a mix you will typically find in a DC gay bar expect for Mr. Ps, where the young fellows are predominantly prostitutes. We also took a wrong turn and ended up in a neighborhood of tiny homes with elaborate gardens, and some show pigeons with fancy feet and tails. B says a lot of people in Poland who live in the cities have another plot of land outside the city where they keep a garden. Perhaps this is the equivalent of that.

      The female branch of the posse discovered bingo in their neighborhood.  An old smoky room on top of the fire station filled with your typical bingo crowd, plus us. Quite  urlLink quaint , minus the gung-ho players cursing the called numbers under their breath.  Wow, I'm at a lost to describe the place. It's so itself it seems silly, like saying what a park is like or describing the beach. If you've been there, you know it. If you haven't, it doesn't really matter what I say.  urlLink Odd .  Anyway, we had one false positive early on before we figured out double bingo meant two bingos on a card.  Then on the second-to-last game, I was watching the  urlLink B3 , when lo and behold, they called it.  So on my first night out, being treated by the posse, I won some cash.  Cool.  I'll be taking them out for  urlLink drinks  sometime in the near future. We's got to enjoy our winnings :)  Busy weekend ahead, including an improv jam (email dcimprovjam at yahoo.com to get a spot) Sunday night ( urlLink 9PM @ Playbill ), party Saturday, and dinner tonight.  Fahrenheit 9/11 comes out today. Not sure when I'll see it.  I'm ready to get pissed though. I like the truth, I like opening eyes, I like propaganda, but I don't like when they try to become each other. It's disturbing no matter what issue you're pushing.

      I got my first old-fashioned scam! A letter from Spain saying I won the lottery and need to send them all my personal information to collect, get this, 735000 Euros! Actually, it's what I like to call the "Primitve Fatty" award. I'm honored. They even use those logos and colors that remind you of the old constant-feed paper. You know, the kind where you take off the edges. Well guys, thanks so much for the stamp. It's really pretty.

      Back from a proper improv weekend. Worked both the Big Bang shows, got to play in the scene lab class, watched the Nation show, then worked the door at Motley.  Oh, and there’s class tonight! Phew. Man, good audiences for all the shows, both in terms of size as well as demeanor (Saturday’s Big Bang we managed to fit everyone in, totally oversold, but luckily a bigger venue).  Class registration is up too.  Oh, and Motley turned out better than expected. It’s nice to actually mix up the players and see how they deal with each other.   Don’t go into the  urlLink woods !

       urlLink This  just disgusts me.  I have no issue with the cause, just the tactics.  Like begets like, violence breeds more violence. Once the US fought armies. Now we're fighting a bunch of thugs.  Disgusting.  We should keep aware of what goes on, but not publicize so well.  There's notoriety in all this, one sick PR campaign to bring in more funding and support. It's a moral shit hole for all parties involved.

Two useful liks from the article:  urlLink 419 Legal   urlLink Scam-O-Rama   In other news, my dog's sick.  The parents spent last night at the emergency vet and left her there overnight.  My mom's taking her to the regular vet today. The doctors say it's a heart murmer and she needs medication. I liken it to a slow heart attack/siezure combo. It's how our first dog died, but she was 17. Kiwi's only 10. She did this once before, the doctors suggesting she was bit by a snake or spider. Hopefully it's the latter and she'll be ok.

      Back in the district after a short  urlLink jaunt  home to see the 'rents.  One of them decided to come home with me, so I'm busy these next couple of days. It's nice though, since we have the same sense of humour. I rarely laugh so hard or over such mundane moments as when she's around.  The weird thing is, you don't even have to  urlLink say something . There's an understood punchline and reference built in and you just burst out laughing with barely a glance in the same direction.  We hit the famed  urlLink IKEA  on the way back and got some shelves too.  So once again, a bit of rearranging going on at home.   Who all caught the Regean services?  Yeah, shut up already.  It's nice to see traditions and the remaking of an ex-president.  We'll see how well the revisionist history holds. One thing I continue to worry about though, is what will happen to  urlLink Robert Smigel 's super hero team now that another one of the  urlLink X-Presidents  has fallen?

       urlLink Always protocol . From the middle of the article onwards, it’s interesting.  Class last night, missed a few people, several late comers, nice energy for the evening.  I’m recognizing a lot of the exercises from last time I took this level. There are different students, a different teacher, and overall the feeling’s different this time around. I’m not as freaked out. That’s good.   One of the mates is looking to get involved in a group. I’ll have to see if I can get him in on the early side our endeavor, see what the others think of him.  Of course, no clue where we’re at anymore.  Things moved along quite well there, then poof, nothing for almost a month.  Not good. We need to jump start this engine and get on down the road.  Some people are just  urlLink a pain .  Yet the last paragraph is darkly humorous. Think Edward Gorey images.   oh and go find the "torture justified" articles.

      We had to collect large almonds which (I just typed hcihw) were buried in the muck of a fountain pond. Part of an office project. The stones had emblems in them, and matched up to various presidents. I don’t know why we had the task, there was a trolley car that we rode that was left to run and made tighter and tighter loops on the track before that, on the top of a roof.  Ten almond stones, I was scooping with my hands, when people said ew, you’re not sticking your hands in there! So I stopped and started feeling around with my feet. We had on plastic booties over our shoes, which we knew wouldn’t do much good as we’d sink much deeper into the muck. In my hand in that scoop though, I had six of them, I had found the rest, I didn’t tell though, the others wanted to search. One broke open and had two small stones in it. I set about to match them with the correct historical reference.  I partly blame this on last night’s IN show, which had a segment with Eisenhower and Dewey and Truman and a bunch of other incorrect historical references which were pointed out and corrected by the end, much to the audience’s semi-delight (we’d fallen by that point into thinking, uh, yeah, Dewey and Eisenhower. I think we were embarrassed at our own ignorance).  The other show I saw didn’t mess with my mind in the same way. Thank Goodness.

      OK, I really hope there's not a quota on the number of times you can risk your life, cause i just pulled another close one, thanks to excessive drinking.  The worst thing though is that despite all that, I keep thinking about drinking.  Idiot.  This of course signals that I can't have any liquor for a full month, and that when I do let myself drink again, no more than two.  I really like the buzz, and that's what I've been drinking for. Oh, the days when I used to be so careful. Yes yes, this is of course the very first time I've ever had so much to drink that I've fallen ill, but it's one time too many.  Tonight: Harry Potter with the posse Tomorrow: Time with the boy Sunday: working a show  Heading home next weekend for a bit. Still don't know how I'm getting back, but something will come.  I need to take my vitamins.  And find some pro-liver food.

      Yes, already. I told you I'm out of it.  Ate pulled-pork bbq with coleslaw at a steakhouse near Dux new place. Dux has a very nice space now, sharing it with three other people. The neighborhood’s a lot nicer, and we even got to see the Netherlands House (from the Chicago World’s Fair).    We spent the entire day at  urlLink MFA  and it happened to be appreciation day, so we got in free to everything.  The best exhibit by far was “ urlLink The Art of the Japanese Postcard .” I’d recommend making a trip to see it before it’s gone. Excelletn presentation of teh materials.  Gauguin was, well, I guess I’m not a fan. Although I did appreciate their use of various media from indigenous art, which inspired much of his work, and didn’t gloss over the past.   New York consisted of walking, a lot.  We walked in Greenwich Village, Soho, Central Park and Washington Square. Dined at Figgaros, Spice, and Dante’s and hit the Moma Store, where I found a delightful pink book on  urlLink Russian Criminal Tattoos  (there’s an English version out now). Very cool.    Boy was very nonchalant the whole time, and occasionally would ask why I put up with him. Of course, I’m thinking exactly the same, wondering why he’s putting up with me.  No fights, no horrible habits revealed (on his side, me, well, he could tell large crowds freak me out at times).  No clue as to what J and A thought of him. Haha, well, A was probably a bit put off, as he kept revealing bad habits of his to her, and she’s pretty proper.  J made us breakfast before we left, yummy.

      We sat on the causeway for a while. I thought to myself, we must be far back in line for take off.  The airline wasn’t well staffed. One flight attendant was hyper-worried about getting coffee and snacks and worrying where the snacks were and blocking the ailse in search of said snacks, while another was in a foul mood lurking about the back and rearranging the obviously incompetent overhead stuffing arrangements.  So the fact they dind’t tell us we were in line, was no surprise.  Then the captain comes on and says, “well folks, we seem to have a bit of a glitch with the fuel in engine one. I’m talking to our maintenance guys on the cell phone in Miami and see if we can get this fixed.” Note: we’re in Boston.  So they run the left engine. They run the right. I’m praying there’s a glitch so we can get a new plane. The captain blames it on their new fangled computer program, and well, he’s no computer engineer, but his guys assure him they should be able to get it running. Great.    Landed late. Waited on the shuttle. Lots of parking shuttles, but not ours. Then, there was the stereotypical short older businessman, like a fit uncle moneybags minus the monocle, decidedly british looking, pacing back in forth.  A shuttle for lot A comes by, opens it’s doors, he leans in and so politely asks, in his finest voice, “where the fuck is the Amtrak shuttle!!!”  If I could smack those people with their anger, I think it’d make their balls drop off and discourage them form such outbursts in the future. I really wish I could.  Back in town, needing sleep, lost at work.  NYC and Boston were great, as well as the company.

      These are the final three days before the big meeting.&nbsp; Then I am out of town for not one, but two weeks.&nbsp; Two.&nbsp; That rocks.&nbsp;   Agenda for today, besides work: locate a long black skirt.&nbsp; I went shopping Saturday and ran across one of those form fitting stretch skirts. Just doesn't work on my body type - too close to the naked form, without the fun of actually being naked.&nbsp; So now I've decided I need a black skirt. Not one of those short tennis types that's showing up everywhere, no frills, no look you can see my ass.  Sunday spent with boy. We hung around his place playing board games. At one point he attempted to get me to play a video game.&nbsp; One of those Fighter Jet deals.&nbsp; I crashed twice, including on one of the training missions.&nbsp; But I managed to shoot down the enemy fighters on my second try!&nbsp; Time well spent, being with him.&nbsp; It's funny how you can feel like you know someone so well and yet have only been around them for a few months.&nbsp; And it's nice becuasee this isn't one of those stupid crushes or adapting to someone becuase at least it's someone to like you.&nbsp; He is a bit odd to those who first meet him, but the longer I'm around him less unusual he seems, it's just him, the way he is, and that's fine.&nbsp; We even had a cabbie ask where he was from ("you look like you're from somewhere else").&nbsp;  He's fantastic.

      Not only did I drink caffeine at dinner, hang with my sister, and watch Spirited Away once more, but I talked with boy. Boy and I are meeting up after work. I have not seen him in two days, but the way I'm acting you'd think it'd been two weeks.&nbsp;   My body's so hyped up with caffeine I may be getting withdrawl headaches now.&nbsp; I slept hardly at all, shallow when I did. If I knew I didn't have work in the morning, I probably would have started cleaning, that's how hyped I am. Ridiculous.   Way too much to do today, and I've put in extra hours.&nbsp; Obviously, not enough.   Anyway, craziness + Adreneline +&nbsp;Caffeine = eeeeeeee

      Looking for  urlLink love  on Southwest airlines? I guess it all depends on the  urlLink flight . &nbsp; I'm slightly disturbed by the sudden change in appearance of blogger. It looks like Word meets email. Eek. &nbsp; Went out to the Melting Pot last night with&nbsp;the boy and one of his friends, who I had heard was pleasant, and met once and seemed pleasant, and turned out to yes, indeed, be pleasant.&nbsp; We spent four hours eating.&nbsp; The waitress was really cool and chatty. If I'd been more on top of things I should have invited her to an improv show.&nbsp; She seems like the type that'd be fun to hang out with.

      well, I read over a friend's blog, then read over some of my old entries, and given how I've been this week, alcohol is evil.  As much as I loved it, and while I still take a drink here or there, life is so much better right now. I'm actually excited about my job again, enthusiastic and inspired by pressure, drinking caffeine and not being super bitchy.   OK, so yes I'm still moody, but the difference in the alert factor of this brain, damn. Caffeine good.    This morning, I discovered why the Pepsi wasn't helping much: caffeine free.  Whoops.  Haha.  Also, kudos to the squirrel for being a good interesting writer.  I guess all that reading she does adds to more than just her wit :)  Boy bonding good, although I find myself totally afraid of likeing someone.  There's some baggage that I carry that makes trusting words so very hard.  It's good he's so sweet. I would've freaked out a lot more by now.  Stupid brain.

      Some  urlLink sensible talk  about sharks.  This ain't the cougar killing a runner type deal where you can locate the animal, kill it, and be sure everyone's safe.  Sharks have never developed a fear of humans, and they won't ever. You need to deal with the fact there are still wild animals out there, and you have to take the risk of getting killed.    I found it humorous that our local newscasters followed that story with the usual banter about sharks not really liking humans as a meal choice.  It's all myth. Just like humans went and ate anything they could get their hands on as they migrated to new lands (think first people to Madagascar and giant six foot tall lemurs. Why aren't there any more giant lemurs? We ate them. Oh, and think early to pre ag socieities. I'm not talking about the 1800's or even 1400's).  Sharks eat what they can. They're hungry. Heck, think of how much fish we eat. It's our own damn fault for eating so much fish that other populations dwindle, leaving us as one of the more numerous food sources. At least it could reach that point one day.  Deal people. They're sharks, we're meaty, and we're in the water.  Dinner happens.  Speaking of happenings, how frightening that the US could POSTPONE elections? THe only way we should ever dealy is if one or more of the candidates is killed 24 hours before, or if there's a disaster the day of the election. And we should go out THE NEXT DAY and vote and say f-you to manipulative assholes.  Ugh.

      Watch the Bush  urlLink campaign videos . Actually, watch  urlLink Kerry's videos  first, then Bush's, and you'll see why Bush has always been so succesful (2000 primaries: chaged the public's perspective to beleive he, not John McCain, was the reformer with results. Bush never reformed anything by that point in his political career.). The camera shots, the crowds, the juxtaposition of images and sounds:  urlLink Goebbels  would  be proud.  Kerry's camp needs to punch home a few choice terms about who he is, something catchy and popular that will make people think he's the man for the job, the man of the future.  Staying positive; I'm not sure how well that will work if his entire character is asassinated. We can only hope the negative rhetoric will reach a fevered pitch in which voters are turned off by Bush's campaign.  Who knows what teh best strategy is, but Kerry's camp needs new PR people (and how about Bush's use of female voice overs and Kerry's of males?)  Oh, and fuck off with the election bombing shit.  What do you want, another four years of Bush? Are you that desperate for free recruitment material that you'd rather have him in office, because you know this country is stubborn, and will stick with who we got if any trouble arises, even if you say you'll blow up 10,000 people everyday Bush remains in office.  We'll change the rules and let him run for a third term. We're stubborn S.O.B.s. How do you think our industry took so long to change (that which has)? I don't want four more years of him, you don't want four more years of him. Hold off until after the elections. This ain't Spain.

      I'll be jumping back into the swing of things shortly. After viewing the new team ad for Kerry Edwards, dude, no wonder people don't have an opinion of Kerry. They even made JE's highlights seem dull.  Put some pizazz in there people. It's one thing to be professional, another to be visual anesthesia.   I'm also disappointed that there aren't new logos and slogans up all over their site. Knowing a new name was on the way, you'd think there would have been some specs drawn up and put on reserve so they could just drop in a name.  Y'all are slow and unprepared.  I'll go check out teh Bush camp and see what they got. I know there are Kerry bugs all over this. Hopefully they won't affect the visuals for the other team (watch what ads you get, Pro Kerry or Pro Bush).  Oh, and teh Republican attack squads?  Geez y'all. Sounds like you got Kerry press corp advising you (see above about the new ad).

      Now that it's official, I'll list  urlLink Kerry-Edwards .  I'm also  urlLink soliciting .  Edition:  Did you hear the crowd's roar when they announced Edwards?  Sure he's a trial lawyer and you'd expect him to sell you a used a car as quickly as he tosses a sound bite, but this man has energy, he has passion, he has life. And while I'm a bit leary of him being too gung-ho on National Security at home, he has the grounding that signals he'd make the right decisions if he had to take over as President.    If the Clintons try to toss him out so Hillary can run, and succeeed, you can blame the next four years of hell on her sorry little ass and realize even certain salesmen are better any day than a power-hungry leader. It's time for the establishment to shift. You've lost too many political battles to keep playing teh same game. Look where it's gotten us.  Oh, and Edwards wife kicks ass. The perfect behind-the-scens power player that reminds me of my own mother, the kind that's  strong woman who speaks her mind and has so much common sense you just beam with a pride. A true southern woman and not the mushed up soccer mom that tv ads portray in detergent commercials. She's polite wwhen she should be, but ain't gonna get pushed around.

      It was no surprise to the crowd at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in suburban Virginia that Linda Ronstadt closed her show last night with her classic rendition of "Desperado." But what came as a shock to the apparently bipartisan full house was her dedication of the encore to a man she described as a "patriot" -- filmmaker Michael Moore. Ronstadt introduced the song by saying she had just seen Moore's controversial "Fahrenheit 9/11" twice. "I love you, Michael Moore," she crooned, sparking a rousing cheer from part of the audience. That was countered by an immediate chorus of boos from others, many of whom walked out as she belted out the tune. It's a good thing Ronstadt still has a powerful set of pipes, because the continuing cacophony of cheering and jeering would have drowned out a weaker voice.

      When I came in this week, the papers covering the air vents had been moved. Actually, sign one something was up was my door shut and locked. Anyway, apparently they were cleaning air vents over the weeekend.  Great notice.    So today, while riding down the elevator for lunch, I read the sign mentioning air vent cleaning for the upper floors. Apparently they get a notice. I'm trying to decipher whether they're telling people to always keep the objects away from the events, or just move them to save the workers some time when the door pings and opens. I turn around and a man and woman stand outside. The woman stands slightly hunched, her head titled with an almost gawking expression from her mouth. Puzzling. I step out and head my way and as I open the door hear her commenting about getting out of the elevator.    Apparently there's a millisecond rule for elevators, and it's rude to stand any longer. Of course, she probably didn't take into consideration how very curious she looked, and I figured her expresiion was one of surprise that I did not run out of the elevator, so I lingered for an entire half a milli-second to ponder her very interesting looking body language.  Yes, there was a second of anger as well as a desire to go snip back at her. But as I thought to myself that she must have a bug up her ass, I felt a bit of glee that I have no such problem, and did a little skip down the sidewalk.

      All quiet on the western front. No hoard of media stomping through to see the announcement so widely touted by colleagues. Makes me seem a bit more successful. Not sure when I'll write again, as I'm in away from computers starting his afternoon until the 14th. What will await my inbox, I dread to read. But vacation is much needed, as well as outdoors. Speaking of which, the arboretum here's very nice. Lots of trails and pretty trees and cute lgbs (little grey birds). Party last night fun, despite the sudden appearance of a particular person. They did leave eventually, so all was well. Cliques. Someone mentioned cliques. As usual, I feel insulted. Mentioning cliques in my presence is tatamount to accusing me of being in one and excluding others. Maybe my coworkers are, I'm not sure. You do get inside jokes when you work with a small subset all the time, but still, cliques? Honey, if you think I'm in one cause you didn't see me or get invited by me anywhere, that's b/c I wasn't anywhere, I was off by myself or with my mom, or hoping someone will invite me to go out. Anyway.  I would say send me your address and I'll send you a postcard, but I won't get your email in time I suspect. Oh well. I'll try to remember all my peeps and bring home a goody bag (a summertime santa of sorts, 'cept you don't need to be good).  Hope all are well out there.

      My body still treats the world in its old time zone. So I wake up at three and find myself getting to work around 7 everyday.  This morning on my walk I was greeted by what looked like a  urlLink coatamundi .  Except bigger and not so stripy.  I don't know Northwestern mammals.  Anyway, very tired, another five hours to go of talks, dinners and photograhpy.  Yikes.  Boy is very cute. Left me a message last night.  So sweet ;)
