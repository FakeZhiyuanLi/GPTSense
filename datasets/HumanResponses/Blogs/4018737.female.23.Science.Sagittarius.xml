      I'm bored.... and have lost my imagination for the night, therefore have copied a fellow idea.&nbsp; My loves and hates as seen from Hawaii (not really too much to hate right now ;)) Glad I don't have insomnia though, I just have roosters.    LOVE    My boyfriend (sappy and mislead as it may be)   The sun glistening off the ocean  My coral friends  SCUBAing (When the water is above 70 F that is)   HATE    Mosquitoes (Should be wiped off the face of the earth)   Mosquito bites!  Roosters who live outside&nbsp;my window and wake up at 5am (and&nbsp;consequently, so do I)  Computer keyboards that only have&nbsp;select keys that work (Annoying!) Being far far away from the things I love (see above)

      I'm on Coconut Island off of O'ahu enjoying the Pacific breezes through my window.&nbsp; What are you doing?&nbsp;

       urlLink    This is Jackie and Kylla standing on the road I run on, that runs from the lab to town, the wrigley marine science center is behind them in the distance.  The apartments we live in are in the far upper right hand corner. The ocean is down to the left, sorry you can't see it.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is Spike, he has lived outside my apartment at Catalina for the last week and a half and he's now caught 3 nasty flies.  He's my personal bug catcher.  :)&nbsp; urlLink

      So I think this is the longest amount of time I've spent straight living on Catalina Island.  I've actually started to appreciate it's beauty and serenity.  I went for a few runs along the dirt road that runs from the lab to town, it over looks the Pacific and on very very clear days you can almost see the port of LA 32 miles away.  I forgot how wonderful it is to run with no one else around; no cars, no homeless people, no stares, no SMOG!  Now if I can only keep my 23 year old knees from falling apart I'll keep doing it.  There are a few strange draw backs to spending all your time on this island and underwater:   -You have fairly permanent sunglass lines   -You name the spiders (see pic)   -Your nails grow really fast   -Your skin peels off and itches   -You always think you smell neoprene and pee   -You wear your t-shirts 2 or 3 times (3 or 4 times) and that's perfectly normal   I'm sure I'll come up with more later, but, I'm leaving tomorrow after I give a stupid presentation that I'm not looking forward to. blah!  However, I do get to bore a group of 14 year old girls that have to come and watch, hahaha.  I mean, hopefully I'll be able to sculpt them into little marine biologists too :)

       urlLink    I just thought this was a beautiful view of the shallow Catalina island kelp forest, the larger algae is Macrocystis kelp and the bright green is sea grass, the rest is macroalage that I could I.D. for you, but I'm sure you don't really care.   urlLink

       urlLink    Isn't this an adorable juvenile?  It's a baby Garibaldi.  It reminds me of being in the tropics because of it's bright colors. I'm not sure how it survives, other than it seems to like to hang out among sea urchin spines. By the way, it took me soo long to get this picture, so you better like it.  urlLink

       urlLink    This is the adult version of the previous fish pictured, it is also the California state fish, the Garibaldi.  When he grows up he's not so cute because he's such a territorial bastard! I was surrounded by about 7 of them today because I started taking samples from their precious algae. weirdos!  urlLink

      ugh... I looked under a dissecting scope for 4 hours today and now I feel ill.  This is a little morbid.  I fed my little strawberry anemones some sea monkeys and then I cut them open to see if I could see the monkeys inside, weird huh?  I felt a little bad....

       Me? I've made 210 .... and I've spent  82.5 hours  underwater just since I've been in California (since last August)  Now, let me ask you something.... does it make sense that my boyfriend who has 14 dives total under his belt should get master diver status before me?  No not really :) But, what can I do.  I didn't get to take the fancy schmancy dive course that he gets to take.  So I'm just going to grin and bare it and fork over the $500 bucks when I feel like paying for a card I already know I have in my mind.  The dive shops never believe me though, silly. haha.   So I'm still at Catalina wasting away.  My back hurts from diving so shallow.  Some people say diving shallow can make you paralyzed, I'm hoping that's an urban legend.  eek!  Hope you all watched the Olympic show tonight :)  Goodnight all.

       has sun (sometimes), waves (most of the time), deer, fleas, and no tv :)    So it's been a crazy summer and I think I've spent more time traveling than I have at home. Let's see, I came to Catalina to set up my project in June, then went to Wilmington for the 4th of July, came back to Catalina, then went to O'ahu for 10 days at the end of July to help my professor with his research, and now I'm back at Catalina. I see JP for a couple days at a time now and then, especially since he's just as busy! (see his Blog)    Anyway, I'm stuck on this island until next week sometime only to come back and watch JP go to Catalina for the weekend to finish his dive class, funny huh? I bug him a lot about all the things he's doing in his scientific diving course, but just because I'm a nerd and find it all so interesting. If I had the time, I'd take the course too!    So on the island, I pretty much spend my days diving at Bird Rock ( named because of the gigantic amount of bird crap covering it's surface - see picture). Underwater I count and measure tiny anemones (see pic) in permanent squares I made by hammering nails in as markers. This is all very tedious. Sometimes I feel like I'm going a little crazy underwater!    So when I'm not underwater - did I mention I've spent 80 hours underwater just since I've been in California?? - I'm attaching anemones to little plexiglas squares for analysis, or reading, or trying to figure out how to beg, borrow, and steal enough money to get through the next year and a half living in LA! I've decided that marine scientists, especially students, were never designed to live among the stars. Natural selection is attempting to take hold and push us out.    So that's all for now - updates soon to come I hope.
