      Tomorrow is Friday.......good. I like how I act like I have been at school for a long time.....when it's been a week. I hope I get to hang out with Lindsey tomorrow I am with her a lot, but she could never be boring so I am always hoping I can hang out with her. She is so fun, I could not ask for anyone better, she is perfect for me....I hope she knows that. I will now make like I am on the skyway.........and cruise out on the highway.....?

Well.....I think the Porth is coming over here in a little bit. I don't really have too much to say. I am going to make like a flamin and go.

      Okay guys, I miss her! Lindsey is perfect and I am so lucky. She makes me have so much fun while doing the smallest things like sitting on my couch......I am so happy. I wish we could have all the time in the world together, but I am extremely happy with what I have and I could never ask for better than Lindsey. I shall make like a tan and go.

      Today was a swell one brought to me by someone I like and care about very much. Her name is Lindsey, and after school we went for a walk at Ha Ha Tonka and I had a great time. After this swell time in my life, Jake proceeded to cometh to my house and we recorded some weird things, and then after that Tyler came over and we played some songs of ours. Well that is my day minus the school. I am outta here like the troposphere. The Prime Stinister

      Today was a really good day, for a Monday. I got most my scores back from finals, and well my grades should be straight A's which is really freaking cool. I don't have any homework either and sometimes I sit here and wonder why I tell this to the computer.......weird. I got to see Lindsey after school like usual so that was cool. Well I don't have too much to say, hope you like the track you are probably hearing right now. Now I am out like trout.

      WELL.....the finals have been defeated. It's over and done. I think I did horrible on my language final and I was very upset for a long time, but being with Lindsey after school today really cheered me up. Something about her........she's perfect for me I believe. Well, I am going to put on some jams. I shall make like a tree and leaf.

      All right, so this is what went down today.......finals suck......I took my Spanish final and I am hoping I did okay, I am not really sure what to think about that one. My math final I schooled, and my history final went okay, but we will wait see how I did. But yeah, stress is crazy and..........it, as well as finals considering that is where I got the stress, sucks. I just relieved stressed by playing la guitarra for a little while, and I got to see Lindsey after school and that eases things a little, so rock on. Now, I shall make like Tom and Cruise.

      There used to be a lot of stuffage on here but they were all out-dated so they no longer exist here. I haven't posted in a long time, but all I really have to say is I really like Lindsey and I really don't want to screw this up. She is differant than most girls, cooler, nicer.....you know.....the cool list. Oh! Did I mention that finals at school suck! Yeah, I have so much crap I have to do for the stupid little tests that I might go insane or otherwise ride a mongoose. I have to study for three tonight, and the same tomorrow night. As well I must find time to play my guitar, which frankly is radi-cool so I must find this so called "time" to play some "tunage." Well I am going to make like hockey and get the puck outta here.

      Hey! I had a great night last night with Lindsey. We went to Wal-Mart like all the cool kids do and then we rented Orange County. I had a great time like I always do with her. Today we kind of got into a fight and I feel horrible. I am so glad she is forgiving towards by blowing things out of proportion. I hope she knows that I love her and she means the world to me. Well I best get ready for a cool Saturday so I will leave you all now.  I am going to make like Jackson and Jet? Stin

      Hey...it's been a while. Today was a crazy Monday as all Mondays are. Homework I didn't remeber kept popping up out of nowhere so of course I was stressed trying to get that done and of course cleaning the tables was just a really great time. Of course a little smile swept over my face at the sight of Lindsey though, and that always helps. She always helps; she sweeps all worries off my mind like they were never there when I talk to her. It's awesome, she's as close to perfect as anyone could ever get. Well I am out like a boy scout fishing for trout on a camp out.  Austijalterizer

      Welcome to the world of Austin. Today we will be talking about school, and how un-radicool it really is. Basically I have a lot of homework and it sucks, but don't worry guys......I have Lindsey to make me smile still. Ahh she is so perfect. Anyways, I will get outta here for now.

      Yesterday was Valentines Day, and the best one I have ever had. I spent the whole day with Lindsey and I told her I fell in love with her, and that I loved her. I never want to lose her, and I know never is a really powerful word. I am officially the most lucky person in the world and as long as Lindsey is with me I will stay that way. Well I need food...peace out home stout?         Stin

      I just got home from one of the most perfect nights ever. I went to Lindsey's house along with Jake and Megan (congrats to you two if you read) and we watched scary movies for Friday the 13th. I had so much fun...I like her sooo much. Better yet I get to spend Valentines Day with her...I could not ask for a better person. Well I just thought I should update.

      Wow today was hilarious. First, one of my favorite teachers is gone, and we have a sub while she is doing the whole baby thing, and the sub sucks. Second, I fall asleep in P.E. because reading is really boring...and we had to read in P.E.! Third, Mr. Lewis finds Tyler's and my fork animals (really freaking cool) and we have to clean lunch tables for 10 days. All in all though today rocked and I am not kidding, probably because Lindsey. Well I am out of this joint. I will make like a plane and jet.  El Austin de Flazeirenstien.

      Hey all. I just got done playing my guitar up in my room and my eye caught Lindsey's in a picture and feelings just suddenly came out. It is the weirdest feeling in the world, but I love it. These feelings came out in the music that I love so much, and the poored onto paper. The words might mean nothing to others but they mean a lot to me. I suddenly caught her eye... I hope to never lose it.  Out like the a boy scout I now am.                 Tuna

      All right, I am in the middle of a 24 hour movie making festival contest thing and I am taking a break. My fellow movie-making friends are asleep, but all I can think about is Lindsey, as usual. She going to be here in like 15 minutes to help us so, rock on! Can't wait to see her again. Anyways, I gotta make like a film maker and...I don't know I am just a really corny. Stin

           Hola mis amigo. No has escuela manana! I hope we don't have school anyways, but I really wanna see Lindsey because more time with her, would be well spent ;). I can never get her out of my mind, but I truly love that because even the thought of her makes me feel I am the luckiest person alive, and I am. I wish I could tell her everything I feel, I need to find a bigger vocabulary first.  I am out like a boy scout.    El Gran Foncho

      Well, I just got done talking to this girl I met a while back. She's pretty cool. Okay, well you got me, she the girl I want to be with forever. I would do anything for her, and sometimes I feel like I should tell her more even though I smother her in it all the time. I hope she knows I love her and I will never leave her. She is the one and only and always will be. I love you Lindsey, and for everyone else, go tell some other people that I love her because I want everyone to know.

      Hola. I am back from tennis...which by the way was a very cold time. It is freezing outside. Lindsey left school early to go shopping. She is sick and it is my fault (think about it...you'll get it). I feel bad for her, I wish I could help her. I love her so much. Well it is time to eat.

      Hey. I am sitting doing nothing. I just thought since I haven't written much I would update. Last night I went to Jakes house with Tyler, Lindsey, and Megan. I had a great time. I always have a great time when I am with Lindsey though. Lindsey and I decided to go outside, where I saw my first shooting star, and better yet, I got to be with the person I love so much. We both happened to look over and there it was for a split second. Well, I got some stuff to do. I'm out like a boy scout.       Aus

      Hey. I just got of the phone with Lindsey. She is so awesome. I realize I am mean sometimes and I just hope she knows how much I care. I hope she can see through some of the stuff I do and realize that I will never leave her side. That's all I need to tell the world for now. I will know leave this room like a witch on a broom.

      I just got done with some ice cream eating that came after my guitar playing that came after my homework. Yeah anyway...tennis practice was canceled for me today so after school Tyler and I went bowling and then went to pick up Brune. Now I am just sitting here thinking about Lindsey, and how I wish she were here with me right now. She is perfect, and I know I say that all the time, but I mean it so you better recognize. Well I don't really have much to say. Later Skaters.                                                                Taco

I cherish her birthday so much, I just feel like it is a celebration of the day that God placed this beautiful human being on this Earth; placed the girl that I was meant to be with forever, and without this day I would never have met the thing person that makes me happiest and that I love so much.

I am getting scared she isn't feeling it like she used to, or how I am. I wouldn't want her to ever lose her feelings for me, that would suck. I still love her, and of course I always will. She is perfect. Well boys and girls, I am going to make like a zygote and split. Austin

      Today Becky came over and shortly after followed Tyler and Tahnee. And even though we had a great time, the only thing I could think of was Lindsey. I miss her so much and it hasn't even been a day yet since I have seen her. I just want to see her now. I always want to see her. If only I could see her 24/7. I love Lindsey.                                   Austin

      I just got back from seeing  The Prince and I    with Lindsey. Even though some might consider it a "chick-flick" I thought it was pretty good. Then again, anything that has to do with Lindsey is of course great. I love her more than anybody could imagine. I miss her already and it has been about 10 minutes. I will always miss her when she is not around.  Stinaus

      Lindsey is the nicest person in the world. Today she picks me up a 11:30 A.M. and takes me to Ha Ha Tonka where we have a picnic and she gives me a blown up framed picture of us, a journal she started, and a photo album she started. I fall more and more in love with her everday and if I ever lose her, I will lose everything I am here on this Earth for. I want the world to know that I will love Lindsey for the rest of my life and even after that in Heaven. I want to be with her forever and I hope she feels this true love for me like I do for her. I love you Lindsey, don't ever leave me. You are my world and always will be; you are everything to me. Thank you with everything I have.

      Hello again, it's been a long time since I have updated this thing and I kinda feel bad, not that many people even look at it. I never told you all about the great time I had a prom. I will just say it was one of the greatest days ever. Now for more recent times...tonight I am going to Main Street Music Hall with Lindsey and her family, and I can't wait to see her. She is so perfect for me, I love her so much, and I always will.

      Hey all! I am now back from Hawai'i. It was the trip of a lifetime, I have never had more fun in my entire life. On the way there our plane stopped at the L.A. airport and I met Jason Mraz! How cool? The best part was a whole week with Lindsey, I loved it. The people I roomed with had some fun too. By that I mean Tyler, Jake, and Jordon. It was awesome. Lindsey is going to New Mexico on a mission trip tomorrow for 9 days, and I am going to miss her like crazy! I can't wait until she gets back. If anyone needs more Hawai'i detail, I have some awesome stories, so just ask. Have a great trip Linz!!! Austin

      Lindsey just left my house because she had to go to a "plates and things" store at the mall, so she stopped by my house and I went with her. I didn't get to see her too long, but the fact that I did makes me really happy. I love seeing her, what can I say? She rocks my world. On another note, we had band this morning to get ready to go to Hawaii.....it was so boring. We marched 5 miles, and we will again tomorrow, and the next day, and Monday. It will all pay off when we are actaully there.

I think I will become the president and make it a law that she has to see me all day everyday.&nbsp; We spent all day Saturday together up in Springfield with Jef and Chelsea where we went ice skating and shopping. It was cool shiz. I like pizza. I wish I could spend that much time with&nbsp;her more.

I love doing that with her; well I would love to do anything with her actaully, she is so fun. She is working right now. She was at my house earlier but since she left I just did random stuff. I went to Wal-Mart to get some milk and then I went to Music 4 Less and got the new Coheed &amp; Cambria cd. It's good, muy bien.

It also will be helpful for me to put my shiz out there so people know what's up.                                                  Peace and Hair Grease
