      There once was a Professor called Crum She had everyone at the base of her Thumb She really liked Some, And thought everyone else Dumb.  GIS is her Toy,  And she can't stop talking to "Pretty Boy". The rest of us are just part of her Ploy To make people feel bad, and find herself some Joy.  It really helps her to Think If she has a little Drink, And brings us all to the Brink With a twitch of her nose, and a Wink.

      It looks like I have become addicted to a new routine.  Drop off Gabby, go to Big Apple Bagels, come home, get online.  I don't think this bagel and coffee addiction is a good thing.  I tried to change it up a bit and got veggie lite cream cheese instead of plain.  It better be good.  Gabby is going to her dad's for like the 5th weekend in a row.  I feel like the world's worst mother...and that's probably a lot closer to the truth than I even realize.  I am so excited that Josh started blogging.  He's so witty and funny that reading his blogs is definitely an uplifting experience...everyone should try a little Josh humor.  He'll get published and be famous, and give me half of the profits since I provide so much inspiration for his jokes!!!  Jackass!!!  This is it buddy.  This is the way you're going to break into being on the New York Bestsellers!!!  This is what you let lawschool go for.  I'm not sure I'm liking this veggie lite stuff.  It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so "chunky".  The carrots are kind of gross.  Today I'm having lunch with Josh at 12 and seeing Aaron at 2, and then I'm off to drop off Gabby.  I need to add a little cleaning in there as well.  Today is looking better than yesterday did.

      Blogdom or Boredom?&nbsp; Today is the worst day ever.&nbsp; It gets very old not working.&nbsp; Especially when everyone else is at work.&nbsp; I sit here and try to think of new things to look up online just not to be bored.&nbsp; I decided I should mess around with some pictures and change them up a bit.&nbsp; I came up with one that I just thought was very scary.&nbsp; Jessica had other ideas however.&nbsp; She thinks I look like I'm a "poop eater".&nbsp; Who's the one who really has time on their hands?&nbsp; I just thought it looked scary.&nbsp; That Jessica's imagination is wild! Oh, did I mention she's also very pretty.&nbsp; (She told me to talk about that).&nbsp; I guess pretty is good enough for her.&nbsp; I would have told her to discuss how "gorgeous" I am, but if pretty is all she wants, then pretty is all she gets.&nbsp; Enough about Jessica.&nbsp; Josh told everyone at work that he didn't know me, and said that everyone around him was absolutely disgusted with this picture.&nbsp; Well, it is pretty gross.&nbsp; But once again I just thought it was scary...not "poop-eating disgusting"!&nbsp; I think I should just crawl back in bed until it's time to go to school and this day is over.&nbsp; Or maybe I should try making it to the gym.&nbsp; I've had enough coffee to make me able to run a marathon!&nbsp; Ha Ha, Josh and Jess, you both missed out on Big Apple Bagels!&nbsp;

      I'm kind of feeling an urge to blog this morning...just to get my thoughts out...do something to keep my mind busy and relieve some stress...yet, I don't seem to have anything to say.&nbsp; I totatlly skipped doing cardio this morning, and know that I won't make it to the gym for the rest of the day...being very lazy.&nbsp; I stopped this morning and got a bagel and coffe.&nbsp; I was standing in line with all the other people who were either wearing business suits or scrubs (I live in the medical center after all), and I felt quite out of place in my Maroon5 (yeah!) T-shirt and jeans that I wore to school last night and just threw on this morning to take Gabby to school.&nbsp; No make-up and hair in a ponytail. &nbsp;I was looking quite decrepit amongst those other "working folks"!&nbsp; I'm wondering how my life&nbsp;got to be this freakin' boring!!!&nbsp; And then I'm wondering why the bagel shop has to be right next to a mortuary?...just a thought.

      I went to the gym today to work out with Aaron (trainer) even though I just did it yesterday at 4.  He decides (after he's already put me through a grueling 30min) that it might not have been such a good idea to schedule me two days in a row.  That's thinking ahead for you, and now I won't be able to walk tomorrow.  Anyways, what I really want to talk about is this lady who I see at the gym every other day.  She's always working out on the same machine (precor), and she's always wearing the same thing.  She wears jean shorts (cuffed) and a white tank top.  Her hair is dyed platinum blonde, she has on full make-up, and the part that really bothers me is the red colored nylons that she wears under tha shorts, and I'm not talking about "tights".  I'm talkin' red see through nylons!  Ok, I just had to vent a little on that one.  I don't know why it bothers me so much, but I just really want to knock her down.

      Went to Maroon5 and John Mayer concert on Sunday with John.&nbsp; Had a blast.&nbsp; The weather was absolutely awesome.&nbsp; It was raining and the temperature dropped from like 90 to 75 degrees.&nbsp; Got a little wet, but it was better to be wet by the rain than sweat!&nbsp; Haven't talked to John since, and that's a good thing.&nbsp; I can't believe how much I felt like I was in junior high again watching Maroon5...like wanting to fantasize about having the singer (Adam) be my boyfriend...I've got major issues!!!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; I'm having a hard time setting up this whole blog thing...I need help!!!!!, Jess!!!!!!!&nbsp; Quit working and help me!!!!!!

      I have no idea why I'm doing this.  It's not like I don't already have myself on enough sites with enough info.  I was looking at Jess' and thought hmmmm...let's give it a go...late for the gym as usual...this will have to wait.

      This morning, Gabby and I went to her new school for "open house/meet your teacher". Gabby was acting shy as usual with people she doesn't know. I don't know why I'm so scared that she's not going to be able to adjust, or that she's going to be traumatized in some weird way by changing part of her world around. She's excited, and she really wants to do this. I'm the one that's scared she's not going to be able to find the cafeteria, or that she's not going to be able to get breakfast and lunch. We were both really "pampered" by having her go to a private daycare for kindergarten. She was at that daycare since she was 2! Kids adjust though. They usually adjust much more easily than adults do. I have nothing to worry about, but can't help feeling a little sad that my baby is a 1st grader!!! I feel like I've missed sooo much. This is one of the other reasons I wonder if me going to school is worth it. I know in the long run it will help get us ahead, but in the meantime, I've sacrificed so much just to be able to finish, and the biggest thing I've sacrificed is time with my child. And because I have spent so little time with her during the fall/spring semesters I don't know how to spend time with her anymore. I've gotten used to being by myself kind of...and she's used to be the center of attention at my parent's house. I really feel like an outsider sometimes, and like I don't really know her. I get a little jealous of my mom sometimes, because even though I know Gabby loves me and wants to be with me more than anyone else...she still would rather go and play at my mom's or her dad's than be here. I just really hope she knows how much I love her, and I wish she could understand that my main reason for going back to school and working this hard is all for her, but in the end would she rather just have my time than have me make more money so she can have more "things"?  I'm just being an overemotional wreck of a parent this morning. It's always hard when things "change", and we're both really going to miss the experiences we've had with the awesome people from her daycare.

      Yesterday I found out some very disturbing news.  The whole past year and a half that Josh and I have been friends, I have felt really lucky to have this "boy" (I don't think of myself as much more than a "girl") who is my age, alot like myself, has roughly the same background as me, and grown up through the same "era"...BUT, NO, Josh LIED to me!!!  He is not my age!!!  He is actually 33!!!  He is the same age as my sister!!!  He didn't grow up in the nineties like me...he grew up in the eighties!!!  He's not a "boy", he's a dirty old man!  Not that 33 is old (sorry, Carolyn).  It's kind of like watching a movie and at the end you find out "who done it", and you think back on the entirety of the movie, and you can see the parts where you should have known the truth, and you feel...a little betrayed...a little cheated.  I now can look back and I know the parts where it makes total sense that he is 33.  It makes me think differently about everything that we have ever talked about...I feel a little cheated.  But don't worry, Josh, I still like you, well...at least as well as I've always liked you...which we both know isn't very much...lol...  You should consider yourself lucky that I'm still talking to you!!!  Even Lauren (who let me remind you is almost 10 years younger than you...which is scary finding out)knew before me!!!  I can't wait to tell everyone at work, and ruin your reputation even more!!! haahahahahaahahhahahhhhhhhhhhhahahaahhaahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahah

      Josh did the nicest thing in the world for me today...he called in sick and took me to get a pedicure.  It was the best pedicure ever!!!  The massage chair was going, my feet were soaking, I got a nice leg massage, and hot towels wrapped around my feet.  My toes were polished, I was stuck under the dryer, and sent on my way.  Not even two seconds out of the salon I'm looking down at my toes, and even without my glasses on, I can see that somethin' just ain't right!  I take a closer look, and sure enough...they're like a bad plastic surgery...completely botched.  My big toenails are cut to a length that is almost to the point of being painful, and the polish job is the worst I have ever seen.  I was supposed to get an American Manicure...a little like a French Manicure, but more natural looking.  There's supposed to be a little white line across the top of each toe...hmmmm...it seems to be missing from some toes altogether, and from others, just in the middle.  Gabby could have painted them and I would have had a better job done.  The last time I went to this same place, I got the most beautiful pedicure EVER!  The person who did them this time was different...but how different can you get?  Oh, Oh, Oh...I was so relaxed and just reading a magazine that I wasn't really paying attention, but towards the end after my toes had been painted...and I guess the guy was trying to "fix" them or something (I still wasn't paying that much attention), I realize that this guy has thumb nails that are longer then almost any girl with fake nails!!!!!...and he is using them to clean off the toenail polish around my toes!!!!...and I also realize that these must have been what he was using to clean under my toes as well!!!!  I very much enjoyed "getting" this pedicure, but in the end...it was, well, I don't need to tell you.  Hopefully there will be some understanding...  :)

      I got another A!!! I was so worried about this summer class that I took, but I go an A!!!  I now have 85 credit hours and only 35 more to go!!!  Looks like I will graduate in the Fall of 2005, as long as my classes for this fall don't get cancelled, and that's not looking very good!!!

      I just found out last night that Gabby is going to be home for the next two weekends.  That will make it three weekends in a row.  Ok, this should make me happy, right?  And...it does...but I need a break sometimes!!!  Now, three weekends in a row doesn't sound  bad , but think about it this way...I will not have a break in a total of  6 weeks.  That's a long time to go without a break when you're a single parent.  And, that also means that she won't see her dad in that amount of time.  She'll be crying every freakin' Friday until she gets to go.  I'll just have to come up with stuff to keep us REAL busy!

      I went with Gabby to a birthday party today for a little girl in her Karate class.  It was being held at the Karate school.  I was not informed that the only other people that were going to be there was family...and Gabby and me.  The little girl is the niece of the owner of the Karate place.  It was the weirdest, most uncomfortable thing in the world, but we made it through.  As long as I can find a way not to break Gabby's spirit when disciplining her...my daughter will be a Leader.  She has the most uncanny knack for bringing people right up under her thumb.  Watching her with other little kids is amazing...they all turn into HER "pack".  These are qualities that no one really has on either side of her family...unless that's only because the rest of "us" had our spirits broken.  Gabby is truly a gift beyond belief, and I really, really need to learn to appreciate it, and not let the daily grind get in the way.    Online dating:  Truly a strange, but maybe good thing.  It seems to be becoming more of the way to meet people, and it's very scary.  Yet, at the same time...exhilirating?  Hmmm...I think I've already said too much in some weird way.  I'm not sure I'm being very honest here, and I really don't know what to say that I can say.  Ok, I'm leaving off on this subject until I do know what it is that I want to say.  Have you ever done anything or met anyone and just known things?  This usually happens to me with everyone that I meet...I just kind of KNOW where it's going.    Any takers on why it is that people, only in western society, have to follow certain rules when "dating"?  And why it's not ok to just go with it.............?  Stepping outside the box is so hard and so unaccepted.  I am.....

      This blog is probably going to sound very cliche and very trivial, or at best just the ramblings of a mad woman...We all work the nine to fiver, we all work and work and work to have more and more commodities...and I, I thought I was doing something different.  I thought, "I'm not the same as all these fools."  I am just following along working until I can get to the point where I CAN be different.  I'm now of the thought that I was completely wrong.  I'm not any different from you or you or you.  I work my butt off trying to finish getting a degree cuz that's what everyone wants.  I work my butt off trying to get a degree in something that I thought would get me somewhere "different".  What I really do is work my butt off to do the same as everyone else: Get a degree and work my nine to fiver so that I can supposrt myself and my child and have more and more THINGS.  Don't get me wrong - I do love those THINGS - I want something more...Why is it not ok with people if you say you want to pick up yourself and your child and move to a desert or to some remote place and live without creature comforts.  People always say, "Wow, that would be great!", but of course, that is always followed by the look that they think you don't see.  The look that says, "You're absolutely nuts!"  Why does my daughter have to grow up in the same institutions as I did.  Did they make me a better person?  Did they make you a better person?  So, if I were to say to you and everyone I've ever known, "I want to join the PeaceCorp and make other people happy, which in turn I hope makes myself happy, which in turn would make my daughter happy."  Would you give me "the look"?  Would you tell me I'm just talking and dreaming...that I've seen one too many movies...LOL...?  And the truth of the matter is...You're Right!  I am just talking...and why?...because I'm too scared to do the things I dream of.  Because I'm too scared to be different.  Because I'm scared of not fitting in.  Because I'm scared of not being comfortable.  Because I'm scared of what my mommy might say.  Because I'm scared if I don't have a plan and if I'm not "organized"...what?...there's no real reason behind that fear...it's just there.  It's just something that has been loaded into my head like a CD-rom.   Social, religious, political, econimcal institutions...These are the very things we try to give to other people so that they will be "better off".  But again I ask, "Did they make you or me a better person?"  I want to help people, I don't want to be afraid, I want to be free of chains of obligation, I want to be free to roam...But, I can TALK about it, and I can COMPLAIN about it...but nothing ever gets changed or done, and in the end this phase will pass until something else brings me to the point where I almost - almost - dare to think that I will make my REAL dreams happen...when I will put aside the dreams that I have been taught to have...and again, the phase will pass.  Because in the end fear wins out...it always does...stupid fears...fears that I'm a bad mother because my child might be reared in the "real world" with foreign children and real life values and adventures, fears that I might have to live without make-up and a bath, fear of bugs, fear of frogs, fear of lizards, and all creepy crawly things...we all know the real fear though...it's nothing but the fear of the unknown and not being accepted, and the fear of...failure.  So, for now, I should probably find some way to be content with the life that I am currently living and not able to get away from...because I'm scared of people and of my own skin.  Vulnerability is a strange, strange thing.  It keeps people from saying and doing a lot of things, and at other times it's just let go...in strange moments like tonight, when an event occurs that really, really makes you think.  Bagels and coffee, pedicures and ex-boyfriend dramas, where to eat and what to do on a Saturday night, how much you drink and what you plan to do when you "grow up"...meaningless...but that is my life...for the moment anyways... ;)

      OH GOD!  Josh has met some random girl at the gym and decided he should show her my picture on the wall of fame.  It's embarrassing enough that I've already had someone recognize me while shopping at Old Navy!  I like being identity free at the gym.  Maybe people pass by and look at it, but for the most part they probably don't recognize me since my hair is down and stuff in the picture, and at the gym it's in a ponytail and I'm a messy ball of sweat crying as Aaron foam rolls the hell out of my legs!  And besides this, Josh knows he's not supposed to acknowledge me at the gym.  You're going to ruin my game!!!  LOL!!!  J/K!!!  And besides that, Josh, you're ruining your own game by telling some girl you like about me!!!  You know I like my solitude at the gym.  It's the only thing I do for myself.  MY TIME, and now you're going to have me being followed like Rocky!  hahaahahahah...J/K.  Hmmmm....is anonymity important or is it better to stand out?...i usually like to blend.  This stupid hair of mine makes that hard though.

      I've started taking these new supplements as of yesterday.  OMG.  They are so awesome.  My workout with Aaron today was SO good!  I am a machine.  A very well oiled machine.  I will be the invincible woman!  Did i spell that right?  I have so much freakin' energy I do not know what to do with it.  I was ready to work out for another hour after my workout today!!!  Crazy I know, but this stuff is awesome.  Everyone should get some.  I finished my summer class yesterday.  I am a mapmaker...a mediocre mapmaker, but a mapmaker nonetheless.  That's a really weird word...it's three words together...what would you call that...two words together are called compound words if I remember correctly...I am having all these weird diatribe thoughts today.  I lost one of my favorite earrings at the gym today, too!  :(  I'm trying to get out to the pool and do my checkbook, but I've been trying to catch up on emails that I've been ignoring. Thoughts on another gym regular...there's this lady who's like 5ft.  She has the biggest arms on a woman I have ever seen.  They don't look gross though, and the rest of her body is not like huge or anything...I am SO jealous.  One day...One day...So, Josh, quit asking me to go to the Olive Garden!  You are ruining my arms!!!  And thanks a lot for the bruises...lol...I got to tell Aaron how I kicked your butt in the pool again today when he wanted to know why I had a bruise from hell on my leg!!!!  Just admit I'm stronger than you!!!  There's no shame!  I'm not a normal girl remember...I'm a MACHINE!  LOL!  C'est la vie, mon amie!

      I made it through the morning without having my bagel and coffee fix.  Kind of made me sad :(  LOL.  Went to the gym this morning...Aaron and I were not getting along so well.  I think there was some tension.  He was probably frustrated with me for complaining so much, and me with him for making me do really hard stuff the whole time back to back.  I have to be at school all day to finish things that I put off all last week!  I am such the procrastinator.  Ok, I'm having a hard time finishing this and IM-ing at the same time...

      I am slowly but surely joining the 21st century.  Yesterday I got a webcam.  Today I installed it.  I can't believe how hard it was to install...not really hard...but I was getting a lot of error messages and stuff, but alas...I did...all by myself...It's always very cool when that happens.  This was a pretty good weekend.  A little drama started it off, but it has definitely ended up very well.  So, now I get to take cute little pictures and stuff.  I'm so excited.  My bagel and coffe addiction took over again this morning.  Tomorrow I AM NOT going to even think about bagels and coffee!!!  I had a conversation this morning about the other other white meat...it was a little disturbing, Christopher!  Are insects really considered animals or are shell fish for that matter?
