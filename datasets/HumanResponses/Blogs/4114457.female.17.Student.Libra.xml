      Goodness today was a boring day..... all i did during the day was rearrange some things in my room and put up some things on the wall ie: my posters and glow in the dark stars. After dinner, I went to Mel's and we caught up on some chit-chat and I told her what all had been going on in the wonderful life that is me.... HA!!! but relatively boring

      What would have been a seemingly uneventful day turned out to be just the opposite. Last night at 10:30 the phone rang... uh-huh.... work... they needed me from 6:30-2:30 but of course it was 5 o'clock before i got outta there. Not to mention the dodos from corporate where there. Eh, at least it is hours... I was finally alive enough to answer the phone tonight too. I felt so bad when I noticed I had about 20 missed calls because I was either sleeping or at work.... I really don't mind my job but some of the crap that is going on is getting rediculous.... ya know? We constantly have people running their mouths about eachother..... stolen merchandise.... stuff stolen out of purses... I swear... 3 months and I am already tired of the bs.

      I didn’t do much of anything today. I slept till twelve thirty and lounged around the house for the rest of the day. As it turns out…. my days off keep turning into days working I have another 6:30-2:30 day tomorrow… those are killer. Oh well, it beats me sitting here with my mind wandering like it does. I am so ready to just give up on everything…. I cannot have anything or anyone I really need. It is depressing… well since I didn’t do much there isn’t much to say…wish the phone would ring and it would be someone other than work though

      wow..... ummm..... hmmmmm..... first entry and well lets just say that today and the last two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster..... where to begin... ummmmm i guess the beginning.... i am 16, i will be a senior this fall.... WOO HOO C/O 2004 baby!!!!! i am a band geek...... i write.... a lot...... i am in love... though that is a complicated story in itself.... i dont recommend it unless you actually have a chance with that person.... i have made the mistake numerous times though this is the first i can call it love.... it has left me so lost and confused but so has a lot of stuff.... part of it is inexperience and part is how hard i fell so fast..... but it is safe to say next year will be quite interesting.... just another chapter in my life

       Do you ever feel like you are the last to know anything… or like the world is singling you out… that was how I felt all day. I just have to say how much I love the voicemails I get where I am yelled at or where I get all sorts of attitude when all I wanted to do was help in the first place. I feel like everything between me and everyone else is a lie, they lie, I lie, we all do it, and we all do it for different reasons. I try to avoid it but sometimes you have no choice, you have to protect yourself or someone else. Of course, ya know, I worked 8 hours on next to no sleep so maybe I am blowing everything slightly out of proportion but what can I say… here I am, dead tired at work and the corporate office shows up… ha, during lunch rush none the less. So everyone is scrambling, I am already worn out and about to fall over and I find out I can’t even get some water!?!?!? Uh, sorry LOL I chugged half a bottle while corporate was still there. I didn’t get caught (thank goodness--- I say this now but I didn’t mean it earlier) and I just keep on trying to work. I would rather be working then most anyplace else in the world though. And that one other place I would rather be…. It will never happen anyway, so I guess I gotta settle. But if you think about it, when I work my mind typically stays on the job, especially when we are busy, of course, as soon as it slows down and I get a chance to catch my breath… all my glorious thoughts about everyone start up again. ey yi yi!!!! I really outta be medicated. LOL ummmm don't get me started on that conversation. As soon as I got home today though I checked my phone, which is when I got the beautiful voicemail and so I called Courtney… I just kinda sat there on the phone once I said what had happened and of course, everyone got worried that I was up to something… maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t but either way, it isn’t really their problem anymore. If I don't care anymore, why should they??? Sometime after 4 I zonked out from everything, being tired and "stressed" (as everyone puts it) and didn’t wake up till dinner at almost 7. It is actually 8 o’clock now but I figure too much more exciting stuff can’t really happen between now and when I set this up online so hopefully tomorrow will be better….. HA!!! Yeah right, but it was an attempt and an honest one at that… more tomorrow…. Please stay tuned for the continuing saga.

      wow, it has been a couple of days since i have written.... gee wonder why, i worked 14.5 hours on saturday and 14 on sunday and 9.5 on tuesday. but that is okay... i need to keep my mind off of things. i recently realized what a grade A idiot i am, and how i have made so many mistakes in my life that nothing can really balance them at this point... i have screwed myself out of friends, tricked myself into thinking i had a shot at something i never should have went for anyway and took 6 sleeping pills to make it all go away.... yay me!! :*-(

      Wowser has it been a while since i have written.... i have had a lot on my mind though and just not always up to writing about it where it is public access, but you know.... i just dont care anymore... you want it... you got it... i worked almost all weekend as usual. i guess i do it to keep my mind off things but here lately, it hasnt exactly been my escape. Russell quit hardee's so i dont have to face him as often with all the "rumors?" that are going around... hmm for all i know it could be the truth... and Chris had me in tears yet again the other night.... why is it all so damn unfair??? school is already a PITA and yeah... i just want to be done with it all.... i have had to fix like 4 people and hell, i cant even fix myself.... go figure.... and i have been dead tired.thought... sorry..... hence the random thoughts and dots....

      EEEEE!!!!!!! today is officially day 4 for me and Brian, and i couldnt be happier... so it seems, we are exactly what eachother needed! it is always good when it happens like that. i have been working mad hours and it is cute how he stands at the counter hoping for 5 minutes to be able to talk before i get off. i really hope this will be long term, i am loving every minute we spend together! ya know, i used to think chris could make me happy, but he isnt even talking to me at this point, and even though it bothers me, i am not stressing it; i have brian, and ya know, he may be all i need.... idk yet, but it seems that way. btw bri, if u r reading this, thnx for everything u have already given me, and i hope i can provide u with just as much if not more!

      People come to me with their problems and when they feel overwhelmed, and i take care of them to the best of my ability, but i think sometimes it gets lost in the notes that some of what they are dealing with, i am dealing with. A local kid was beaten to death Saturday. That much I found out last night. His name was Jamahl Jones, and I went to school with him. That much I found out today. Last night I found out a friend of mine was having issues helping his/her friend that was a friend of Jamahl. And now, I have a friend saying that he/she thinks that she knows how the situation occured. Yea, I know it is confusing, but I want to keep actual names out of the obvious. I don't want to be the one starting rumors. Especially not on a diary. How is it that I always find things out the difficult way? In news that I will use real names in, Anthony told us last night that Jordan had been arrested. He said it was a kidnapping charge. I have more inside information that i am not at liberty to say anything about but for the time being, i can be happy. I guess some people get what they deserve while others just live tragedy that William Shakespeare wouldnt even write. Anyway, that is all for now. I might write more after work tonight

      Wow, I have a lot on my mind tonight.... first, and to no one reference in particular... do you ever wonder how something may have taken place had you taken a different course of action. I wonder that a lot... I mean, what if you would have given that homeless guy your change from lunch? Maybe it is enough for him to do something drastic, and help someone else... I mean, you never know. Things really could be different in the world. Second, I can't over how everyday with Brian feels so brand new... I mean, he still gives me butterflies even holding hands, the most basic of gestures. I am just so happy. Last night I saw a commercial for cancer treatment or life insurance or something along the lines and the woman supposedly died, and I started crying because I don't wanna leave Brian under those circumstances. Idk, it is weird, I never before was afraid of dying until right then. I really wanna keep him forever. I have never had anything that just felt this right and comfortable. It is like a smile, 24-7-365. Also, I registered for classes at AACC. I was supposed to have Tuesdays and Thursdays free, but the Bio 107 was full on Mondays and Wednesdays. I am not sure what that is gonna do to my schedule as far as a social and work life. I guess it is just strange the way it all works out, but I am not ever gonna complain. I am gonna go wallow in happiness now, have a good night!

      geez, this whole DSL thing is soooo much more trouble than it is worth, but hey, i am happy sometimes, right??? i am ready to quit Hardee's.... everything is just driving me nuts, i used to look forward to work, but now, now i just hate going in. i want nothing to do with anyone there, or at least that is how i feel right now. i am sure later on i will cool down, but for the time being, i just don't want to be there. idk anymore.... about the only thing i am happy with still is brian.... yesterday was four months, and unfortunetly, i was working and being a bitch from hell. it wasn't intentional, but i was just sick of work. i am sure all of u reading this knows how it goes. it was good to have today off. and heck, for that matter, i am tomorrow/today too, since it is yet again after midnight. i think i am gonna clean my car and my room tomorrow. shoot, when u look forward to cleaning over work, u know u r in deep. lol, anyway that is all for tonight, i am gonna job hunt and then go to bed.... night night, love u brian (brianne~ HAHAHAHA :P lol, inside joke, right 'Manda???)

      Well, today I had my first college class. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I can neither say whether it was what I thought it would be, or not. It wasn't bad though. I mean, I can see myself there for a little while. All we did was work on a big packet of math problems.... hmmm, sounds like regular school. Not only that, the answers were on the bottom of the pages. Whatever, at least Courtney and Melanie were in the class with me. It will be over Thursday. After class, we all went to hang out at the mall and get dinner. We also picked up Brian, which was a good thing since I don't see him very often anymore. Ever since he started working again, I feel kinda lonely. But I know he loves me, and we will find a way to see each other! Anyway, he is on the phone with me now so I am gonna go talk to him now. ~Peace~

He is supposed to call, but I am just all of a sudden really wanting to cry and see him and wow... I just got emo again, so that is what the is........ it was a long day, what can i say... Russell and 'Lissa were fighting all day, she and I left him at Arundel Mills, picked up Brian, met up with Russell at Marley and then came home... okay, it was a lot more than that, but ya know... BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!  I just kinda wanna cry... I am stressed right now.... tooo many problems to figure out.... ahhhhhhh, ::sniffle sniffle::  oh well, that is all for tonight... peace

       I don't know why but it just kinda feels like a purple night... work was, well, I'm not sure what to say about it... I hope that one of the women who came through doesn't ever come back... not that it is nice to say that but I don't wanna put up with her again. I am really in the mood to write like I used to... I'm not sure I still have it in me, but I kinda started at work tonight... maybe I can just run with what I came up with... here goes nothing, or everything...       She walked alone through a dark, desolate world while shadows of doubt crept past her. At night, she wandered aimlessly through a twisted parallel universe that existed only within her own mind, contemplating and exaggerating her own problems... During the day, she smiled, laughed, existed as she was expected to, but no one could see beneath her surface. Down below, she was troubled, tormented, unhappy, and confused. She felt she had no where to turn... she didn't. No one understood what she was going through. She knew she wasn't alright, but she wasn't at her end either. Having no reason to be unhappy, she tried not to let it get to her, but something wasn't right. Little things got to her, little things became obsessions, there was no longer a big picture. Late one night while trying to understand herself, she became increasingly drawn to a spider making a web outside the window. For a split second she caught herself thinking about it, spiders, the number two fear in the world, second only to public speaking. She wasn't afraid of public speaking, or spiders, or death... she had a fear that wasn't on any top ten fears list... she was afraid of herself and her thoughts... those deep, dark, unnerving thoughts that could make even the most sane person start thinking irrationally... She left work, went home, and waited. She wasn't sure what she was waiting for; she just knew it was coming. And it was... it was coming before anyone had suspected it would, and finally her paranoia would be answered... it came, and went, taking her down with it, as well as everyone she had ever met, influenced, loved or had been loved by. But after that night it was over. It never again got to her, but no one understood why she did what she did, or how she could. It was late that night, the fog was heavy, the moon was full... the perfect night to walk away from everything, everyone, and not come back.

       we had some kick ass thunderstorms roll through today.... I lost power twice, lol!!! Brian, Courtney and I went to the mall and met up with Chris then we went to Wal-mart!!!! YAY for Wal-mart!!!! I got a couple of new things... nothing major. We met up with Mel, Norm and Greg there too.... I had the day off today, boy was that nice. I drove Mike to his sister's house, ate lunch at McDonald's and got a happy meal.... I now have 3 different Beanie Baby Bears, but I have four total.... one is a duplicate... hee hee, oh well, I love 'em!! I think I am done writing for tonight... peace!
