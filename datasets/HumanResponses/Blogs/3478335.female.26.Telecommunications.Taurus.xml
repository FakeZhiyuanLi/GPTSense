      Blah..blah...blah...why are women so difficult to understand?  Sometimes, I don't even understand myself.   And if I can't do that, how are others suppose to understand me? :o(  Hmm....

      My weekend would normally be spent with my boyfriend but this weekend, its going to be different.  My boyfriend is in Desaru, Malaysia with his colleagues for a weekend getaway and I'm left behind in Singapore lost for what to do.  I swore to myself last night that I'm going to make the best of this opportunity and spend my weekend the best I know how.  I'm going to start the Saturday with a jog and followed by Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) to pay for my school fees (*sigh*....the thought of spending thousands of dollars leaves my heart aching..this better be worth it) after which I'm supposed to head to Sunset Bay, Sentosa.  My favourite pastime is to frolick in the sun..not having to do anything..in my bikini reading my girly mags..enjoying a glass of cold beer...PURE HEAVEN!!!!  :P  And if I still have time in the afternoon, I'm supposed to catch Shrek 2.  Binge on all the junk food while watching the movies...popcorn..nachos...  But hey...I'm not sure how my plan is gonna work out.  As it is, I didn't complete the 1st item in my itinerary.  I overslept and didn't go for the jog.  Kekekekeke...oink..oink...such a pig, right? :D  Anyway, I'm crossing my fingers..and toes.  I hope today is going to be a lovely day!

      How many times in your life do you wonder.."Gee..that girl is gorgeous and she has a good looking boyfriend and a cute dog and she has a body that is simply to die for..yada...yada..yada...I wish I'm her!!!"  If you feel this way, don't worry..there's nothing wrong with it.  Most women especially in their mid 20s suffer from the "Comparison Syndrome".    I confess I'm one of them.  My good friend is an amazing person.  She's only one year older than me and she has a husband to adore her and a healthy baby boy and a nice apartment, etc etc.  I envy her and I wish I'm in her shoes sometimes.  But fact is I can't..I'll never be her...I'll always be me.  Yes, I may not have a husband or a baby and I still live with my parents but at least, I should be thankful that I'm alive.  I can still wake up in the morning and think to myself, "I will have a great day today."  I can breathe in the fresh air and I can laugh and be merry.     Life is what you make of it .  There's no point in sitting down and going green with envy over others.  If you really want something badly, work hard and rest assured you'll achieve it.  Does this all sound like psycho-babble bullshit?  :O)  Nah....

         What is it about the Euro Cup that has every Tom, Dick & Harry turning into punters?  Everyone will be glued to their TV screens fighting the zzz monsters to watch the live telecast of the matches.  Some even subscribe to Cable just so that they can watch Euro Cup.  I wonder if they are truly interested in this wonderful sport or they are just into it cos of the hefty sum of money placed on the table.  The soccer season is famous for urgent leaves and medical leaves.  Every Euro Cup and World Cup will see the typical office half full cos many can't wake up in the morning to go to work..so they rub their eyes till it turns red or do all sort of funny stuff to make themselves look sick.  Clinics will be crowded with people pretending to be sick.  The funny thing is that these people do get MCs so I'm not sure who is bluffing who?  I'm pretty sure that our doctors are well aware that they are not genuinely sick and yet, they still hand out MCs like Santa Clause handing out gifts during Christmas.  Isn't it unethical to do so?  Hmmm....*scratch head* :D

      Its soccer fever again... euro2004 !!!  :P  This time around its in Portugal, one of the most inexpensive and fascinating destinations in Europe.  It has a rich seafaring past, superb beach resorts, wistful towns and cities, and a landscape wreathed in olive groves, vineyeards and wheat fields.  All that aside, from 12 June to 4 July 2004, all eyes around the world will be concentrated on Portugal's stadiums.  Millions of different currencies will be changing hands on bets placed on the 16 europian countries' national soccer teams.  Everyone's hopes and dream...to win money...and of course, to see their fav team win the Euro Cup.  Kekekeke...  Tonight Greece is meeting Spain while Russia meets Portugal.    My gut feelings say Spain and Portugal will win.    Spain is the stronger team but Greece are likely to put every available ounce of energy into defending their position in the group.    Portugal can't possibly lose two times in a row in front of a supportive home crowd.  There'll be bloody murder if that happens. :D

         I love it when I am surrounded by lush greeneries.  Its just so wonderful to be in a park.  Somehow, the air smells fresher, it seems calmer and its so soothing for the eyes.    One of my fav places is Botanical Gdn.  I remembered when I was a child, I used to climb this tree with my brother.  And I wouldn't know how to get down.  Luckily the branches are not too high or else, I think my parents would have to call the fire station and send someone to rescue us.  Kekeke :D  Whenever I am stressed, I close my eyes and I imagine myself there.  Its abt 5 o'clock in the evening and the sun is not too bright.  I'm lying down on a mat in the middle of the green lawn, my face is in the sun staring at the blue sky with clouds so white that it looks like cotton candy.  I can smell the grass and the feel of soil on my feet.  And I snuggle with a good book and a cup of cold drink. :D

         This is my boss, Dalina.  I've worked with her for about 3 years now.  From long hair to short hair to long hair again and now permed hair.  This picture was taken in 2002, a month after her wedding (I think).  Sweet, ain't she?  :D  She's been a great boss.  She never fails to render a helping hand when I needed one.  Despite her own piling work and other commitment, she is always ready to assist me with my difficult customers.  All I've got to do is ask.  I know some other bosses may push their work to their subordinates or wash their hands off when their staff gets into trouble.  But when it comes to Dalina, that'll never happen.  I guess I'm lucky.   I know that its been tough for her for the past one year.  She has to juggle work and her little baby.  And its difficult to raise a child on your own (her hubby was in Australia training to become an SQ pilot) but she's an amazingly strong woman.  She's the only woman I know who goes through child birth for 16 hours without epidural.  For that, I give her two thumbs up and many many applause!  *clap clap clap* :D

      I'm so sleepy and I'm still in the office.  1 hr and 15 mins to go before I get to knock off.  The day is dragging and I can hardly open my eyes. :-(  I can't wait for the weekend.  Although I have nothing fantastic planned, the thought of no work brings a smile to my face.  I'm not saying that I hate my job.  I love it..mainly cos its pretty flexible, ie. I can come late, have long lunches, etc etc but as long as I do my job well, nobody bitches at me.  Don't get the wrong idea, hor?  I don't come late and have long lunches everyday.  This only happens once in a long long time...when the moon is blue.  Muahahahaha!!!  Another plus point to work here is the people...except for one or two weird characters..the rest are all cool people with interesting personalities.  People like Nazlin and Suvitha and Kenny whom I don't consider as colleagues but as friends. :D  The best part of my weekend is spending time with my bf.  And yes...we're fine.  We had a talk and it was rather inconclusive but most impt thing is we are still an item. *wink*  We spend so much time at work during the weekdays that we don't have time to spend with each other.  I appreciate the fact that my bf makes an effort to call me at night and chat for a while even if its very late.  Thanks, baby!  Muacksss...hugzzzz....:-)

      Yesterday was like one of the worse days of my life.  Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.    I can't possibly believe my luck.  Among other things, I quarreled with my dad and my boyfriend.  Its becoming more frequent these days and sometimes, I feel like I'm at the edge of a breakdown.  I stayed up till dawn thinking what has happened and how I could make things better.  Wondering if the problem lies in me...if I'm taking things too seriously and if the answer to everything is just for me to lighten up.    I don't want to lose my boyfriend.  He's a great guy and I've known him for many years now.  He's been a wonderful friend, a true confidante and he's always been there for me when I needed him most.  However, as a boyfriend, I have different expectations of him.  And sometimes when he doesn't fulfill that expectation, I get disappointed and I will question him and he will get pissed.  He says that the problem lies in me and not him.  I love him and to me, he is "The One".  How do I save this relationship?  The morning after..and I'm feeling like crap...

Kekekeke.. ;o)  School has started..in fact, my projects are due soon.  First one will be due on sat after which I have one due almost every other week and exams will be in Oct.  Its only mid semester and I'm alrdy worrying abt my sch fees for next sem.  I better get that credit card fr Citibank or else, I'm dead.

So sad..and a bit frightening.  To all those smokers, quit while you still can!!  *wink*  I'm sure there's many more things that have happened but I missed out to tell.  Anyway, getting lazy now.  Will update at the next round.  Cheerios!!!
