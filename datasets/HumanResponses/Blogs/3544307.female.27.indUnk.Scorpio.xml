      So here are some thoughts on blogging itself.  I have found in my reading that, when trying to communicate on the essential experience of life, the more particular and specific someone can be, the more easily the reader can relate to the universal themes the writer presents.  I find that attempts to encompass the whole world of experience at once leaves an essay limpid and often full of washed out platitudes. A blog says, to borrow from gay pride, "I'm here.  I'm loud and I'm proud.  Here are my thoughts, my experiences."  I applaud my fellows for relating their particular experiences and trusting me to interpret them myself.  The anonymity of blogging which intrigues me is as much from the viewer's perspective as from the writer's. These bloggers share this piece of their life with whomever happens along. I don't know who is reading this. You can anonymously, vicariously experience another true person's perspective. It's very heady stuff.  Especially when it becomes interactive with the comments option.  I am inviting comments on my naked thoughts.  Do you see the intersection of our experiences?

      How often do you lose your compass?  I have these mini-crises when my compass seems to spin every few months.  Whenever this happens I begin again to create the supports for my life's structure.  I would like to think of this as reinforcing, strengthening, but I'm not sure.  So much energy goes into this questioning.  Where is my forward motion?    I think I'll post my own Preamble to the Declaration of Independence.  You know, Me the person of IntraSpeck hold these truths to be self-evident:  The spark of life in each being is deserving of respect; each person is responsible for their own life; each of us changes the world with our every thought and action...  Hmm.  This could get good. More later.  Peace be with you.

      Hello.  I've recently met some lovely people who blog.  After our initial recognition, one supplied his blog address as a way to become familiar with him.  I have just discovered her blog as well.  I am so intrigued with this intimate/anonymous mode of communication, I am trying it out myself.  This blog will be an exploration of the unknown.  I hope. Welcome.

      Why does standing still feel like losing ground?&nbsp; Stillness is so important to my sanity.&nbsp; When I take time to just relax, to veg out, I then feel that I need to pop out of a starting block and BE PRODUCTIVE.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This is a failing.  On the other hand, earlier this month my partner spent a week in enforced lounge mode.&nbsp; He was in too much pain to do much of anything besides lay on the couch watching movies.&nbsp; From this high dose of television (our space is small, so we share&nbsp;most experiences when we're both home),&nbsp;I fell off&nbsp;a wagon I had forgotten about.&nbsp; Whenever I wanted to relax, or didn't know what to do for a few minutes, I turned to Television, the Great Nurse Anesthesist.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was nearly reflexive.&nbsp; This&nbsp;pattern truely dimmed my inner&nbsp;life for more than a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The&nbsp;experience was harrowing, though it brought me one unexpected gift.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have one fewer delusion with which to place myself separate from my fellow&nbsp;Americans.&nbsp; We&nbsp;allow so much meanness and pain to be&nbsp;inflicted in our name, and I am no better&nbsp;than any other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people are just trying to get by, survive.&nbsp;Our culture doesn't do much to support or nurture our souls. Hence numbing out is a valid reasonable response to a difficult situation.  I am humbled and return to my central question.&nbsp; How&nbsp;do I structure my life&nbsp;so that pursuing my personal path easily supports the&nbsp;flourishing of other life-forces?&nbsp; Yes I want to 'Do no harm', but more than that I want my energy to flow into systems which are actively life-sustaining.&nbsp; AND I don't want to work that hard at it all the time.&nbsp;   At this point I just hold onto my intention and remember that we are all connected.&nbsp; If I can&nbsp;acknowledge the life-force in all my fellow Earthlings, it is enough for now.

      Well, I've spent the last two hours surfing the blogs.  I am only traveling via the links on each blog.  How am I ever going to get anything done now?  There's a whole world out there.  I ended up in the blog kitchen.  It is so much fun to visit a community like that.  They even have a monthly potluck called Is That My Blog Burning?.  Now I need to learn some basic html.  New paths of knowledge are so exciting!!   urlLink http://www.vegblog.org/
