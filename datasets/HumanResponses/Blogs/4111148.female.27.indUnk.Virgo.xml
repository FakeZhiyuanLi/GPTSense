      Forgiveness is not an act of a single person towards another. It is a process of reconciliation that involves an open response from the offender. It is both giving and receiving. It is a two-way restoration of relationship, it is a peace making process to mend the hurt and repair damage caused to the offended party. The aggrieved person can offer forgiveness only if the offender has a sincere repentant disposition to receive it. Only then can the reconciliation at the heart of forgiveness take place.     To be worthy of forgiveness we have to humbly accept that we made a mistake and did what was wrong, admit it and repent with genuine remorse and be willing to do penance and make restitution. Otherwise the exchange involved in forgiveness cannot take place, peace cannot be restored, and the wounds will not heal.For forgiveness to become a reality there is a process of justice that has to run it's course. The offence has to be clearly recognized and acknowledged, both parties have to be heard, the offender accepts the process, admits guilt and humbly accepts just punishment.To ask for forgiveness without repentance and expect that all responsibility for committing crime be taken away is nonsense. Forgiving others in a generous spirit for minor mistakes and wrongdoing recognizing that it comes not from malicious intent but human frailty, without seeking punishment is a good thing to do.  For serious crime, divine justice calls for admission of guilt and a change of heart and mind.The power of forgiveness is effective when it invokes in the wrongdoer true repentance and sorrow. The promise and hope of forgiveness is a positive and powerful way to bring an offender to the truth and a transformation in the spirit.  But that does not then banish the need for penance. This is simple justice and a chance for the offender to reform.God does not want us to have a total blind belief that forgiveness means surrender and appeasement to evil. But also, the act of free will to accept and change has to be there before forgiveness is meaningful.

      Yesterday, the 5th of August was the first day of our program for the preparation for perpetual vows. I felt so happy to be back in Don Bosco and to met again my other classmates in the novitiate who still remained in religious life. It was also extremely nice to see Fr. Pepe Reinoso, one of my loved Salesian professor at DBCS who commenced our preparation program with his topic on the Anthropological and Psychological Dynamics in the vocation to the religious life. Speaking from his heart with his funny anecdotes but with his "experiential authority" he reminded us of the essentials in living our commitments to the life that we would like to embrace for the rest of our lives. I was happy Fr. Pepe still remembered me and the things I did when I was in his class six years ago. I have to remind him that most of those present were also in the same class with me. I was touched when he thanked me for the invitation I sent him for my first religious profession. I have to thanked him too for the Christmas card he sent me 5 years ago when I was still assigned in our Cebu community. It was indeed a day of reminiscing! Gracias Father!

         COMMONSENSE THNINKING: THE WAY WE SURVIVE      Commonsense thinking is an interesting topic to talk about. It is because commonsense thinking is easier to relate with given the fact that it is the usual way people in all walks of life thinks. Even with the breakthroughs in science and technology over the last few centuries, a lot of people still continue to insist on what they used to do and believe in. For them, the world of commonsense is all that there is and they had no patience with anything, which cannot be reduce to such terms. In reality, commonsense thinking is still the way people learn to survive in this world. Peculiar to common sense thinking is that it deals with what is particular, concrete, immediate and practical and not the formulation of general knowledge that is universally accepted. Bernard Lonergan, in his explanation about common sense knowledge said, that it is also accumulated from generation to generation. In fact we can say that the human being survived throughout history because of what he/she has inherited through commonsense thinking from the prior generations. However, this inherited knowledge is also the same knowledge that gave rise to different viewpoints and mentalities in each different community and cultures that also occasion social, cultural, gender and racial problems within and between communities. In the commonsense world, we do also “ trial and error” method of learning. Every time we make mistakes, we try to learn from them, thereby accumulating resources that enable us to respond to new issues that confront us. This “trial and error” way of learning is specific in every context and we have to learn our way all over again when we transfer to other places, or jobs or live with other people in order for us to survive. But as we deal with what is particular and concrete in our struggle to live our lives in this world, we also realize how important commonsense thinking is. We are all conscious that in our daily lives, we seldom practice critical thinking in order to know how to act in a given situation. More often, the situation calls for some obvious reaction that simply comes from commonsense. If in our daily lives we would always think critically, most probably we would only be able to take very few actions in a day because critical thinking is not easy. Since it is not easy, it is commonsense thinking that helps us deal with the complexities of the real world. Commonsense thinking also helps us survive because it makes us find reasonable solutions to problems, though sometimes they are not the accurate ones. An example to this is a particular experience of mine. I remember driving with a friend to a quite remote town in my home province already late one evening due to an emergency situation. Along the way, we have found out that we were running out of gasoline. We were happy to find a filling station along the way, even if the gasoline there was not the best and not the cheapest. Later on, we have realized that we could have thought of other solutions to our problem. However, we chose the one that leads to our desired outcome and we were just contented with it. I think the reason for what we did is that sometimes a reasonable solution would enable us to survive, whereas looking for an accurate solution to a problem would sometimes endanger our lives. A person who paused to work out the best way to escape while a mad dog is closing in on her/him would stand no chances. Sometimes, finding the perfect solution is pointless for the reason that by the time we would find it the problem would have already intensified. Moreover, commonsense helps us how to relate with the world of science and objects. We are consciously aware that the laws of the physical world are relatively simple and few. The real world is made of a finite set of objects that moves in space and do not overlap and that each object has a shape, volume and mass. In relating with the world of science and objects, and in trying to understand how the world works, it is already enough for us to make use of Euclid’s geometry and do not really need the complications of some scientific theories such as the Theory of Relativity and other theories. We do not really need to know about the gravitational laws in order to survive, as long as we are aware that objects tend to fall to the ground unless we put them on a table or in a pocket or hang them to the roof. We know life is a lot easier for our senses than it is for the scientists doing researches in laboratories. What we need to know in order to survive is actually a lot less than what we need to know in order to satisfy our intellectual curiosity. I am aware that there are a lot more reasons on how commonsense thinking help us survive as we cannot always comprehend life scientifically and logically all the time. But I also know that living our life in this world is not only all about survival, but also gaining insights in order to make our lives and the lives of other people much more meaningful. I suppose, we can better understand our own selves as well as other people co-existing with us in this world if we learn to move beyond our own self-centeredness and not always think of what is only useful to us even if our commonsense tells us to do so. Commonsense thinking maybe the mode of all concrete understanding and judgment but I know it would not be enough, for there are a lot more of our experiences that cannot be dealt with commonsense thinking alone. I think it is an imperative for us to move towards the next levels of consciousness so that we can hopefully be aided in deciding and taking responsibilities for our own lives.

      I talked with some of my friends the other day and they told me to publish in my blog the assessment I made of the 2004 Philippine election. So guys, here it is....    The 2004 National Election: An Assessment    Introduction The recently concluded 2004 National Elections has again put the Philippines in the international scene not only because of the kind of politicians who were seeking for public office but also due to the election-related violence that resulted to the killing of over 200 innocent people.  To top it all, our country was in the limelight because of the slow counting of election results and the congressional circus that took place during the canvassing of votes in the joint Congress.  Personally, I find it sad to hear broadcasters from acclaimed international networks commenting about how violent and sleazy our election was.  Even the international observers sent to our country to watch our elections were shocked by the violence and the alleged fraud that took place in the cities and the countryside. But thanks be to God, the election season is over. I am glad that most, if not all of the newly elected public official who were given the mandate to govern their respective constituents have already taken their oath of offices even after all the usual things that made our elections a weird political orgy in our country. At least by now, we hope we can go on with our lives smoothly.  Mindful of these things though, I suppose it is helpful to make an objective assessment of our 2004 National Elections starting from the campaign period until the canvassing of votes in the joint Congress in order to better understand what had happened that eventually would enable us to rally behind the cause for electoral reforms before the conduct of the next national election.  The Campaign Period I would like to believe that other people would agree with me if I would assert that this year’s election campaign was truly remarkable.  It was remarkable for its lack of intelligent debate, for its scarcity of discussion of relevant issues, for the overspending by the candidates, for the obvious and uninhibited violation of the laws and rules, for the number of cases of election-related violence and for the general silliness of the campaign gimmicks.  It was disappointing to note that there was no full debate among candidates seeking for national position because months before, the then-leading candidates refused to participate in one, saying that it was useless and divisive.  There was no discussion of relevant but sensitive or controversial issues because most of the candidates wanted to play it safe.  What took the place of an intelligent and serious discussion of the issues were the usual gimmicks like song-and-dance numbers from either the candidates themselves or from some paid actors and performers, skits by the clowns and comedians, replays of movies and use of memorable one-liners from some movie hits. I’m sorry to say that this year’s campaign season made me feel that the Filipino voters will be forever condemned to this kind of election campaign.  As usual, candidates for national offices overspent in their campaigns.  The presidential candidates, judging from their television and radio advertisements that they aired must certainly have spent much, maybe much more than what they would get in salaries in their entire term of office.  The same was true for senatorial, congressional, gubernatorial and mayoralty candidates- they spent much, much more than they would hope to get in salaries for their entire terms.  I think to ask how they will get back what they have spent will just be irrelevant.  The Election Day        Like every election in the past, the May 10, 2004 election was a testament to the enduring patience and perseverance of the public schoolteachers who manned the voting precincts, the voters, the volunteers, and even the police and military men and women who tried their best to ensure public safety and order.  It was, however, a resounding reproach to the Commission on Election (COMELEC).  The public and the politicians were one in desiring a hassle-free election, with a swift counting of the results to follow. Nevertheless, through a combination of bad judgment, incompetence and dubious deals, the COMELEC ruined the chance to pursue effective automation, and spent hundreds of millions of pesos in half-baked schemes that only further mixed-up the voter’s lists. The result of course, was the insufficiency of supplies in the precincts, or lost forms and materials, and the disenfranchisement of voters.  Reports said that the disenfranchisement could have reached a scale not seen since the snap election of 1986.  Neither the COMELEC nor the watchdog group National Citizens Movement for Free Election (NAMFREL) can say how many voters were deprived of their right to select their leaders. The chief complaint of those who were not able to cast their vote was that their names had disappeared from the voter’s lists or got mixed-up. As a result, the identities even of people who had voted many times in the past were questioned or they were simply denied their right to vote.  And yet there were the usual cases of the dead remaining on the lists, indicating that neither the old lists were purged nor the new ones properly drawn up to take their place.  Further complicating matters was the lack of initiative displayed by some COMELEC officials or schoolteachers who did not try to facilitate voting for those who had a right to do so.  Some of the disenfranchised managed to eventually vote through sheer persistence, many more did not because of bureaucratic obstacles.  The hardest hit were the first-time voters whose initiation into the electoral process consisted of the denial of their right of suffrage.  It was also annoying to hear COMELEC officials reacting to the complaints of the disenfranchised voter by simply restating to them what they should have done before the election.  Their reactions did not help any one and it merely rubbed salt on the wound.  The COMELEC did not have expression of regret, or even remorse and certainly did not attempt to replace speculation with hard numbers concerning the disenfranchised.  The teachers, too, were given short absolution, with no explanation given as to why an already tedious task was made more difficult due to the unorganized system of distributing election paraphernalia.  In short, there was failure of leadership during the election on the part of the COMELEC.  If there was failure on the part of the COMELEC, there was even more on the part of the National Police whose principal duty was to keep the polls peaceful.  Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Hermogenes Ebdane said that “the elections were peaceful,” in spite of an estimated 202 people who were reported to have been killed in election-related violence.  Media reports revealed that based on the comparative figures of election –related violence in the past, this year’s election fatalities ranked the highest in Philippine history, higher even than the death toll in the 1986 election, the aftermath of which saw the Marcos family and cronies chased by angry citizens out of the country.  I could not help but wonder why the PNP, COMELEC  and other top ranking officials in the government said that the 2004 election was “peaceful,” even if our ears, eyes and common sense say it was not.  I suppose I would not be put behind bars if I would ask Gen. Ebdane, “How come so many goons were able to carry their guns with which they killed their victims?” I am just wondering if the PNP Chief and other government officials will have the courage to tell the wives, children  and other family members of those who were killed that the election was “peaceful.” I only hope that someday their own conscience will move them to honestly tell the truth to the Filipino people that the 2004 election was wracked with violence.  The Counting and Canvassing of Votes Only in the Philippines can it happen that the newly elected local executives can only be proclaimed as winners after one week or even more, and the president and vice-president can be proclaimed after 44 days from the election.  The reason: the turtle-paced counting of ballots and the circus-ridden canvassing in Congress.   I think it is not anymore shameful for Filipinos to accept that the counting of election results in our country has always been slow due to different forms of chaos and confusion, overwork on the part of the teachers and even power blackouts in the middle of the counting.  But the tragedy during this year’s election was that most of us have gotten used to chaos and confusion. Unlike in the other electoral exercises when everyone seemed to be in the state of alertness and vigilance for any sign of cheating, this year’s polls seemed to be viewed with, if not complacence, then resignation.  I don’t think the foul-ups surprised anyone.  Even months before the elections, a lot of Filipinos whether prominent or not were already speculating that some amount of cheating would take place.  But the most tragic of all are the parliamentary antics displayed by the “honorable” members of both legislative houses during the canvassing of votes in Congress.  The presence of TV cameras in the session hall appears to have whetted the appetite of publicity-hungry senators and congressmen.  From the way they look at the cameras when they take to the floor, it was obvious that they were enjoying their few minutes of fame.   Name-calling and personal hostility marked the discussion on the manner the votes were canvassed.  Their behaviors were out of sync in a legislative body whose rules of procedure emphasized respect and courtesy for one another during the deliberations.  On several occasions, the congressmen and senators talked at the same time.  They acted as if their lives depended on being able to grab the microphone and say what was in their minds at that particular moment.  Derogatory words, like “stupid” and “silly” were freely exchanged.  It was disgusting to see that these “honorable” members of both houses were also the ones who brought low the parliamentary decorum in Congress. To be specific, I was sad to hear Sen. Aquilino Pimentel setting the tone of the session by innocently pleading that he did not mean to impede the canvassing process.  But he did when he raised so many objections to the proposals to leave the actual canvass to a bicameral committee subject to the review and approval in the joint Congress.  I have also lost my outmost respect for Sen. Edgardo Angara who also articulated his own opposition to the proposals made on the canvassing procedures.  He too employed so many dilatory tactics to at least postpone the proclamation of winners.  But the top buffoon in the legislative comedy was Rep. Dilagen Dilangalen.  He deserved the highest award of cheapening the Congress of the Philippines into the worst deliberative assembly in the entire history of our country.  I think, even the most ordinary citizen in the country could not believe his desecration of elective office with his unpleasant performance.  Dilangalen took offense when an outraged citizen sent him a note telling him to shut up his tiresome filibuster.  He exploded over this well-meant advice from a citizen who could no longer bear the legislator’s senseless arguments.  The presiding officers of the joint-session were no less excusable.  In fact, they deserve to be criticized for their all-too-willing accommodation of the opposition members whose obvious purpose was to delay the proceedings.  Senate Pres. Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Jose De Venecia said they were merely being democratic when they were actually allowing themselves to be used by the minority.  De Venecia even apologized for the conduct of his colleagues on the floor but I think what he should be sorry for was his own conduct in the rostrum.  He and Drilon should have acted with more authority as the occasion required.  They should have remembered that they were presiding over a joint-session ordered by the Constitution itself to canvass the results of a presidential election that should be done with all possible speed and should not justify the conversion of Congress into a circus.  If I have one more thing to say about the canvass proceedings, I would assert that it only revealed the worst motives of the members of Congress.  Their motives had nothing to do with the welfare of our country.  For if they had thought about it, they could not have afford to waste more than P4 million daily of the taxpayers money just delaying the canvassing process. To put it straight, their motives had everything to do only with their personal and political glorification and nothing else.  Conclusion We may have felt that we are not better off now, after we suffered through the longest election season in the world and with the kind of leaders we have put into office, but I know we Filipinos with our deep sense of hope can still manage to go on with our lives although not very smoothly. I think what we need now is not to continue with the “blame game” that our leaders are doing but to help our country in whatever way we can whether we are pro or anti-administration.  Of course, aware of what had happened to us during this year’s election and at least to avoid the same thing to happen, we need to reform the electoral process, beginning with the revamp of the COMELEC and then the full commitment to poll automation so that the results of the next elections will not raise any single doubt about its integrity. We still have a long way to go before the next national election, but I hope when that day comes we could at least say that we are prepared and have already learned our lesson well.

         For the last few years that I journeyed with the sexually abused/exploited girls in our recovery centers, there were many times that the girls told me how important forgiveness was for them. For those who were taught as a child that the Christian thing to do was to forgive and forget was excruciating and a great burden to bear. They felt that they were being convinced to submit to acts of abuse, shame, degradation and to cover up offenses in the name of forgiveness.Others said that they were told that this was the will of God - to suffer, remain silent and forgive as Jesus did. They were made to believe that there was no better recourse for wrong done to them except forgiveness. They were truly misled. I am happy every time they come to me and share that they were delighted to know that Jesus never meant forgiveness to hide crime and sin but that He taught that an offender must be challenged to repent and believe in the gospel, then forgiveness will follow. Their thoughts led me to remember the Scripture passage that says, “Father, forgive them for they did not know what they are doing.” I feel these are the most powerful words of forgiveness in history. Jesus dying in the most barbaric way known pleads for his executioners asking the Father for them to be forgiven, not granting it. Beside him the repentant thief admitted his guilt and begged not to be forgotten; "This day you will be with me in Paradise", Jesus promised. The prodigal son in the Gospel story, admits his sins, begs forgiveness and is embraced by his forgiving father.Many times I have told our girls that our Lord Jesus has given a lot of examples about forgiveness and every time they would hear these stories they would always wonder the mercy and compassion of God. I have also shared with them that the elements of forgiveness include acceptance and admission of guilt, a true commitment to change and acceptance of responsibility and penance. For some people forgiveness is a magic cure for all disharmony and dispute; "forgive and forget", they say. But is it really that easy, that Jesus would agree? I don't think so, there is more to it than that. Recently, during a casual conversation with our girls, one of them shared that she believes forgiveness should be given as a gift to those who truly have remorse for the wrongs they have done. How about you, what do you think?

       We just arrived from Baclaran Church to celebrate the feastday of St. Alphonsus. It was supposed to be yesterday but since it was a Sunday we have to celebrate it today.  We did not only enjoy the sumptuous food prepared for the occasion but also we had wonderful chats with our brothers from the Redemptorists as well as with the MPS Sisters.  The final professions of our sister Bhing and the MPS sisters on the 14th of August was the favorite topic. We were quite proud of having Bishop Tagle to officiate the profession.  They said we're big TiMe! But we're not...Fr. Mick Keenan is really the big time MAN!!!
