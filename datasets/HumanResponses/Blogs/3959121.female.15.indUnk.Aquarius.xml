       Hello again! I'm hyper right now! I had a red marker and I drew all over my face and now it won't come off! It was really idiotic. I do stuff like that when I get hyper. I don't get hyper a lot so I just do weird and crazy stuff!   Hmmmm... lets see today I stayed home the whole day. I watched a lot of tv and ate a lot. I had some of my grandma's tamales and ate a lot of junk food.&nbsp;Wow! I never really realized that I had such a boring and normal like.   I am tres dull! If you don't know what that means it is that i am very dull in french.   At least my life is very dull. I'm watching   The 4400.  &nbsp;It is a very interesting show. OMG!   My mom, dad, and brother are like watching the game of Mexico vs. Brazil. I don't like soccer so I don't bother watching it with them. I'm hungry! I want some blueberry pie. Ok I guess I'll go look for something to eat.&nbsp;  I will leave you with a quote though: " Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined."

       It is another boring Saturday. Other than the fact that we went to go see Spiderman 2 today nothing else happened. Spiderman 2 was really good. It made me cry as people who know me would figure I would do. I thought that it was very dramatic and it had a great story line. I'm the kind of person who thinks of these things. I am a perfectionist and I tend to over think things. Nothing else happened today. I did have McDonald's though. I really wanted to eat some of their fries and my mom went to go buy us some. I LOVE their fries! They are America's Favorite Fries if you had no idea. Ok, before I stop writing I will leave you with a quote: "There are no mistakes, no coincidences. All events are blessings given to us to learn from." I guess that's it for now. I'll write more next time. I'm just tired right now, it's late!

       It has been a while since I have written but we were gone for a week in Mexico. We had fun! We went to the fair there and to the "centro". I bought a lot of stuff and wasted a lot of the money I had. After we left Mexico we went to South Padre Island. I had gone there before but it was like 3 years ago. It was really fun. We made a sand castle and played in the ocean. I got a really bad sunburn though. I got it on my legs, arms, face, and a really bad one on my shoulders and back. I put a lot of sunscreen on my shoulders too and I still got a really bad sunburn. It hurt really bad whenever I would touch it or lift my arms up. It was like that for about 2 days but then it turned into a dark tan. Now it is pealing. It looks really nasty! But we have been back from out of town for about 1 week now. This past weekend I have just gone to gymnastics practice and then come home. I can't believe school is about to start. We only have a week left for school. GRRRRR!! I hate that I really don't want to go back. Ok I have to go eat my burger. ADIOS
