      As I said at the beginning, because I'm new at this I'll probably make mistakes. Well here's one: I neglected to report that on August 12 the City Council voted to put before voters changes to the city charter to be voted on in a special election on November 2, 2004. The proposed changes include:   allowing for the adoption of ordinances after two readings instead of the current three  allowing for the reassignment of department responsibilities  allowing concession agreements with the Parks and Recreation Department to be longer than five years  simplifying procedures for contracts  allowing the City Council or City Manager to establish department divisions by removing references to mandated divisions in the city charter  removing for municipal judges the mandatory retirement age and allow for senior judges to be used in municipal court  removing mandatory requirements for the following areas so that the city council may legislate them: street grading, public improvements, levee districts, trafficways commission, plats and street vacation  allowing the city's human resources director to set the employee compensation schedule according to budget   If approved by voters, most changes will go into effect on May 1, 2005. Sections 22, 25, and 82 will go into effect immediately.

      Some of you might have heard about Mark Funkhouser's audit of the public works department regarding the condition of our city's streets. Engineers at the public works department claim that our streets were in good condition even though most citizens are dissatisfied with them. Mr. Funkhouser found that the engineers and the public were judging the streets by completely different criteria.  Other news outlets wrote stories about this, and those articles are good for finding out what the response is likel to be. In the age of the internet there is no reason why you should not look at  urlLink Mr. Funkhouser's report  yourself.  Here are several news stories related to this:    urlLink Auditor: On the surface, streets donâ€™t pass muster    urlLink Audit finds quite a few bumps in KC's roads

      Here are some city council related news items I found while trolling around the net. I know there's not much logic to this list at the moment. But, I'm still learning how to get this information quickly and efficiently.      urlLink Arena vote puts architect choice at center court    urlLink Barnes replaces McFadden-Weaver on committee    urlLink Council Person Deb Hermann presses Clay County to repay Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds    urlLink Program Management Team Selected for Downtown Arena    urlLink Two local firms on team for arena construction    The second-to-last item comes from Kansas City infoZine, an online newspaper. I've just discovered that they have an Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed. Unfortunately, I can't access the feed from this blog. Eventually, I'll provide a link to a page that just filters city council items. For now, here's a link to to their headlines:  urlLink http://www.infozine.com/index.php

      Here's an item from the August 5, 2004 city council meeting that I found curious. The city council voted 9 to 0 on a resolution to adopt a "Memorandum of Understanding" with the Local 42 chapter of the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF). A Google search on the phrase "Memorandum of Understanding" turned up similar actions by dozens of cities. To comply with the agreement the city council voted to rewrite several sections of the Administrative Code. The council appears to have done the same thing with chapter 3808 back in April. (Local 42 represents the rank and file firefighters, while 3808 represents the officers.)  So far, I haven't been able to find the text of this memorandum. I do not, by any means intend to imply there is something nefarious going on here. I just don't know what's going on here. I will post more information as I get it.

      Simply put, I want to know more about my local political landscape. Since local news coverage doesn't give me quite the detail that I want I decided to go looking for it myself. I thought that as long as I'm doing the work I should let other people know what I find.  I should mention that I'm completely green when it comes to what is happening at city hall. I may comment on things that people more familiar with the local political process, particularly professional reporters, would regard as business as usual. But I think that's good. Maybe some of the business-as-usual stuff should be reported more regularly.
