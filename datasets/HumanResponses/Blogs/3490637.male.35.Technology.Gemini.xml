      This is my first attempt at an unpublished work, albeit, I'm short in the day so my contributions could be sparse. So what to expect out of my amatuerish ambitions? Well, I'm not sure. It changes daily, like the regular texture of life. But generally you'll fine the content seamless, the grammer bad, mispellings and an overuse of commas. But mostly a blog of unassuming characteristics that will prove I too have the same common challenges with life as my fellow humans: Misgivings and the Effete.  We all have something in life that may not have turned out right. And depending on how we look at it, the temperment may change. For me, its a lesson today, a misgiving tomorrow. So to be earnest, and honest. I cannot predict what I may write about. But generally they'll be about misgivings. Second to that I love sports, and athletics is my single-time consuming hobby. So Effete will be the nature of those misgivings. Although I could transgress--we all do.  Let's get started. I grew up in a small town north of Portland, OR where I spent most of my youth terrorizing small gerbels by speeding up the treadmill with a small wheeled contraption I developed from icle sticks and rubberbands. It was a scream to watch my mother run the gammit of emotions--teary eyed stitches to vocal consternation--as the gerbels would hit terminal velocity. Their dainty legs rolled beneath them and they became one with the treadmill, heading over and over until the rubberbands spent their entropy, and the gerbil would come to rest, often dazzed and confused, and sometimes upside down.  Then to Idaho, where I spent my formitive childhood years, chasing bigger kids on a Huffy cruiser, with Haro handlebars and a custom paint job adorned by my father and I with masking tape and a spray can. It was cool. During the spring and fall, the thunderstorsm would rise from across the Treasure Valley and refresh us with a warm cleansing. I can almost smell acrid scent of wet concrete on our street.  On those days, the jumps got higher, the wipeouts harder. The scab tally climbed, and we kept on, oblivious to the drenched clothing, the soaked Nike tennis shoes that Mom just bought. My brother would rise to the occassion as well, rolling his crusier along with us. And sometimes, a fight would breakout, and eventually we all went home, to a hot dinner, dry clothes. Comfort. The Waltons. Good night dear, we love you. Remember to bring your trumpet to school.  We spent 8 years in Boise, and the time went fast, but not so that we didn't make time to bring them all to the place that mattered. We held fast to the notion we'd probably move, but weren't sure. It was a transition on the way to manhood, and the town was a great place to raise a child in the 80s. With rampant homogenization transforming so many place across the US, Boise shed the allure and kept its old-time charm. The parks were spacious, lush. The grass kept perfectly green during summer. And the Boise River ran through it, with tubers and tree swings and train tressles. Sun burns and beer cans, and stories from Dad, with our cousins and friends.  Then we moved back to Washington, where the trees keep green, and the river still runs through it, but the water isn't quite as clean as it used to (for it runs through one the largest nuclear reservations in the world). But here is where I've lived the rest of my life, from 15 to 35, twenty years in reflection. The laughter and loss, the effete and lathargic, friends and enemies amassed. I went to college, played around the world, got a girlfriend, climbed some mountains, skied a few great days, and lived life fast and easy. Then I got married, had two wonderful girls with my lovely wife, and now I'm a Dad, living in suburbia, going to birthday parties and changing nappies.  Who knows what next twenty years or so will portend? I'm looking forward to it.

      Well. Its damn hot today, with the weather streaming in across the Olympics and the clouds hardly providing respite. I woke late and hopeful for the scent of overcooked Jimmy Dean sausage and eggs, but instead I heard my three year old daughter's airy giggle. She was wistfull and restless. She poked me in the nose. "Why does daddy's bedspread have flowers and blue? I arose and stretched, calmly speaking to her with soft high pitched arching answers, hoping to thoroughly satisfy her zest for the mundane reasons why these things are the way they are. To which, I failed miserably and the anticipatory "Why" came rattling back through our airy separation.  "Where's that damn breakfast?", I wondered. She ignored my complaint and asked why her butt has itchies. "Well, young grasshopper (she giggled and I pulled her onto the bed) you need to take if off right when you wake up. What happens is the urine seeps from the absorbent crystals in your Buzz-Light Year pull-up and back to your bum, where it causes a rash on your bum, dear." And not to be out-done I added, "Let's get you into that Hello Kitty underwear, so we can put on some clothes and head out to breakfast." I swept out of bed and her into my arms and headed off to her room, my boys dangling in the cool summer air. Ahhh. Sunday morning with the kids. Freedom. Butt naked baby! Give that boss the finger, cause it's my day to what I want!  We backed the car out of the driveway while my two children wailed in mercy. "To the beach." "The wading pool!" "I want my book. No, I  need  my book," our oldest daughter pleaded.  Our youngest daughter began to pump up the volume. I suspect she had a bubble--they hurt when your only 8 weeks old.  I braced myself and smiled at my wife...your problem Mama. Cause it's papa's day today.  We accelerated down the hill towards our favorite breakfast joint: The Alki Cafe. Situated on the shores of Puget Sound, with ceiling to floor windows soaking up the view like a Buzz-Light-Year pull-up. The place has an all right sausage scramble, and a killer Huevos Rancheros, but to our chagrin the line was out the door. We were late.  We opted for a new place, beneath the West Seattle Bridge. There, next to the harbor train tracks, lives The Chelan Cafe. Bristling with working class stiff and familes. We barged through the glass door and made our way to the restaurant line. Not to be outdone, this cafe had it's wall adorned with a local artist's renditions of seascapes and tugboats. Red and greens and water colors fading into stretched canvas, interspersed with charts and antique photos like the one above the fruit still, that showed M/V Kalakala cruising the Bremerton run, back in the day.  Connected to the diner was an expansive room with tables of families, where kids and older folks enjoyed the sunny disposition, together and happy. This room exuded summer fun; the dull chatter broken by the oft laugh and order kept the air light. The room filled with energy.  Across the diner, a small door opened to a hallway. And connected to the hallway The Chelan Bar opened into a dimly lit tunnel, dim and mysterious. I leaned over and tried squinted hard, trying to see into the bar more clearly.  The room was lit by neon signs reflecting off the painted mirrors. There, sitting on a stool, was a faceless creature slumped over the brass bar. He wore a faded red T-shirt, blue shorts and thongs. His dark hair laid flat on his shoulders. Greased and mashy. The time was 11am. He slumped there motionless, downward into the bartender's well. What was this man thinking? Did he have a family? Probably not. He was just a bar fly on father's day.  I spent the rest of the day kicking in the pool and chasing kiddies with sprinklers. I saw the grass grow. I smiled. I'm lucky

      Went hiking this weekend to rampart ridge, on the crest of the Cascades, a few miles beyond Snoqualmie Pass. Work horsed up that trail like beat down donkey, two kids attached the whole way up and down, pounding my knees, straps digging my shoulders, sweat working my crotch into a four-alarm fire.  The water, everywhere. In the stream. On the high pass, on the cedars bows. And on the trail. Rolling across the rocks, past the roots. On my shoes; over my ankles. Wet feet.  My children attached to me--the youngest, Samantha is only eight weeks. She slept most of the way, periodically waking, cooing and falling back asleep. Madison, three, talked to me all day, asking me questions, followed by the staccato, "Why?". Curious, naive and so impressionable, she wanted to climb a tree with a ladder she believed her Uncle Freddie was hauling to the top of this eight mile endeavor. But still, not a person in sight, until we started to meet the returnees from the trip.  An east coast family working their way slowly back down after a graduation celebration at the University of Washington. A gay man wit his two girlfriends, who were lost, "We're turning around". An overweight man with a buck knife tied to his hip--vintage Nike nylon shorts stuck to his buldged frame like a wet sheet of visqueen against a ballon.  The weather held, but started to rain as we meandered back to the trail. Of course, this is the wild reality, you are dependent upon yourself, in a wilderness as rugged and remote as any in the world. Yet 80 short miles away is a populace of two plus million, teaming across four lane highways, living off shipments from ocean liners arriving from the remote ports in Asia. I had dream last night about this. Living in the moment....

      Had a turd today the size of large banana...it practically tore the hair off my butt. One of those red-faced I'm having a baby moments in the work bathroom. I had a friend who told me years ago that it's always wise to take a crap on company time. And so it is. At ~10am, everyday, I grab the paper, meander past the receptionist, "good morning Jennifer" and slinker into the handicapped stall where I relax for a few minutes...or sometimes ten.  There, while I'm reading in the bathroom stall, I can reflect on the morning. Maybe the bike ride. How good it felt to speed down the hill from my house with the wind in my hair and nairy a tire to keep me upright. Or how this war is dragging on. How it's horrible. How detached I am from the events, because I'm living on the West Coast. Or sadness and hope for the lost lives and familes torn apart as a result of it's terror. The thoughts come and go, but all things lead to the toilet bowl. A wipe. A flush. And the tap-tap of my unit. A quick tuck--watch out for the zipper. Back to my desk.  Recently, I have enjoyed my bike ride into work. Today the heavens opened a torrential downpour upon the streets of Seattle. I was riding in tiger drops. They hurt my eyes. A greyhound bus laid up a wall of water that soaked me from the waist down. A mud puddle hid a pot hole. I hit it hard. It almost caused me to flat.  Bicycling is therapuetic in the morning. Each month, I get into better shape. I feel the fitness in my cadence up hills. I feel the strength in my legs propelling me faster and for longer periods. My lungs ache but it feels good. And pain is my friend. I embrace it as a badge of honor. I feel like the guy in the commercial that races ahead on his bicycle while the announcer voices over, "We've all felt like Lance Armstrong at one point on the bike...". I can relate because sometimes I do feel like Lance. It's fun. I caught myself this morning telling my wife, as I was barely awake, "I  have  to ride. It's days like these that champions are made." As I said it, she was turning over, but the comment stopped her cold. The sheets went silent.  "You think you're Lance Armstrong, or something?" she said.  To which I smiled jokingly, "No." But the reality is I knew better. I was thinking like Lance, and it slipped out. It's times like those the true colors show. I love bicycling.  I feel it in my bones and I hope in the future I'll be able to keep it up--to be a champion in my own mind.
