      Ok...here's today's events in a nutshell (literally):    /--------------------------------------------------------------- / \     \ /  \---------------------------------------------------------------/    OK I know...lame right. Let's just say that my thinking cap got stolen by who knows who (boos..)   Well, job done. By the way, does anyone know where I can find a tagboard?  Actually, there was a dog in church today, quite cute and docile too. It allowed almost everyone to stroke it, and I think it didn't bark. Think. Haha, I wanted to run over to shineforth initially, but for some reason(can't tell :X, confidential;))I decided to stay.I met up with a few friends, then church started. And ended.Then sunday school started, and ended. Nothing much happened though(we discussed cults). At least I learned something. I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO.....   Nevermind.   Muhahaha...time to initiate the opening of a hate list (lol saw my friend's blog...ok ok copyrat or loser or lameo..what...evvver *rolls eyes*):   1)-NONE   2)-NONE   3)-NONE   The comrades on this list may be subjuct to execution by the following manners:   (a) disembowlment (I mean your schoolbag...so that whatever stuff that's personel..*points to zz* may be disclosed to the public and eventually the entire school cohort.....)  (b) reduction (ummm...with reference to your marks...*whistles* someone might accidentally spill some coffee onto your precious little script....oh and not the addition of hydrogen ions to your finger by electrolysis, although that give me an idea....)  (c) boxing ("And today's showdown, the mighty hulk versus the prefect's handy dandy....notebook and trusty sidekick, the pen." Prefect ticks box with '1 demerit point'....anddddd the prefects win it!!! "See I trained them so well!!!" I think you all know who I am talking about)  (d) dis-integration (no...not the maths...but the ms-ages. Yes, your phone would be checked for messages from your *a-hem* and told to every living soul in school)   Regards: with regards to some very special people in my class who will be the hitmen...:p   Anyway nobody's going to die...yet. Muhahahaha..lol(irritating people who are egoistic and are mentally challenged may be the most suitable targets...)  Ciao, ceil out...I'll be back!

      Haha, just had enough time to post something. Actually, nothing much happened today, except that I had to go back to school cause I had forgotten to return my frig**** walkathon card. Sorry about the invective...anyway, hope you enjoy the lyrics.   Angels brought me here by Guy Sebastian    [Verse 1] It's been a long and winding journey, but i'm finally here tonight Picking up the pieces, walking back into the light Into the sunset of your glory, where my heart and future lies There's nothing like that feeling, when i look into your eyes...  [Bridge] My dreams came true, when i found you I found you, my miracle...    [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, that you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...  [Verse 2] Standing here before you, feels like i've been born again Every breath is your love, every heartbeat speaks your name...   [Bridge 2] My dreams came true, right here in front of you My miracle...   [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...  [Bridge 3] Brought me here to be with you, I'll be forever grateful (oh forever Faithful) My dreams came true When I found you My miracle...   [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here... Yes they brought me here...  If you could feel, the tenderness i feel...  You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...   And...  My immortal by Evanescence  I'm so tired of being here Supressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  You used to captivate me by your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me    Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance. Will Durant (1885 - 1981)   Lol...well, takes one to know one. Ciao, ceil out.

      Ciao, people of ze underworld. Sorry, but please mind my language: it might not be too appealing to some people. Haha...some people should know why. Anyway, I feel that penning down feelings in the intricate and multifarious www is just a little too sentimental...haha, no offence for those who demur...so I will just post something else for a change...Here's a paradox to start with...  Happiness or a ham sandwich?  Which is better, eternal happiness or a ham sandwich? It would appear that eternal happiness is better, but this is really not so! After all, nothing is better than eternal happiness, and a ham sandwich is certainly better than nothing. Therefore a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.
