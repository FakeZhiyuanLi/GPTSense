       crying   deflated   searing pain   there is no relief.   existing in the shadows   shame   innocence torn   shards of a beautiful soul adorn an anonymous path   never to be made whole again.

       I woke up      The dream rang in my ears   The pictures screamed   The voices shimmered                  Then broke      I can sense the fragrance of the forbidden night   Taste the serenity within   Images dance across my eyes                  Through my ears      What is real?

       My heart tentatively rejoices   Hoping to feel the truth, taste the desire   My spirit soars   The world is mine   I have conquered the smothering darkness   I have arisen   Carried forth upon triumphant wings   The blackness is vanquished   Every fibre of my very being cries out   I rejoice   My soul feels again.

       The trials of many   Decided by so few   Manipulated by those whose hearts know nothing of loss   Who want for nothing   Yet are possessed of a hunger that can never be sated.      Greedily grasping for the next conquest   The next big crisis   Hoping to reap the dividends   Not heeding the rape of justice perpetrated   By their very presence.      Woe to the masses   Whose voices go unrecorded   Who scream until they are hoarse      And finally can speak no more.      The scales are permanently tipped   Not in favour of the needy   The sick   The dying   No.      The golden statement determines right and wrong      And from there what is left.

       Sadly sifting through the shadows of my past   My mind wanders   Restless   Searching   I stumble over the remains of what was   Once beautiful, whole.      Captured in bold flashes of colour, indelibly etched   A vision of happiness found   Joy that was once celebrated.      I extend myself   Reach out   The memory fades      The blackness remains.

        I crept along through the viscous night   Avoiding the presence of other life   Searching tirelessly for that shaft of truth.      That which would illuminate my path and    Cast asunder my trepidations   Bringing me to that elusive inner peace.      Yet the very thing that will set me free   Escapes my every endeavour   Evaporates with my approach.      I am held in the throes of this vicious night   There is no escape.

        Devouring the pieces of exposed truths   Knowing not what the outcome may be   Ever drawn to the darkling dusk of a forever autumn      Placidly accepting the cruel hand of fate   Sinking finally into interminable stillness   Never to drink again of the cup of May.

       The scarlet dawn envelops the world   You who are enlightened   Cast off the shackles of drudgery   Farewell the pessimist within   Today you are free

       The woven night paints a tapestry of memories Deepening darkness embraces my thoughts I feel you  Your memory casts a shadow in the garden of my despair Illuminating the corners of my well of sorrow Yet you elude me  I hear you  The sweet melody of your being is in exquisite harmony Your truth cries out over all else  I see you  The faded portrait of your countenance Diminishes with each rising day Yet the deepest softest sleep brings you Into vivid clarity  I need you  The separation of our souls is as endless as the night You exist purely simply without me  I am alone

       This shall be the first of several forays into pseudo-philosophy, poetry and prose, architiger-style.       I imagine the primary viewers of my written thoughts shall be close friends and associates, willing to indulge my need for creative expression with more than a little leniency and good humour.        Do not take what I write too seriously!      Remember I am quirky by nature, given to random acts, spontaneity and at times quite unusual perspectives on the world and its inhabitants.      That said, find a comfortable seat, relax and enjoy...
