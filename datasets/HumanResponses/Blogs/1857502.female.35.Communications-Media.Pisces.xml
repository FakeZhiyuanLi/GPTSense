      It's been a good past few days--about a week, actually. I tend not to notice as much as I used to. Maybe it's because I try and keep busy at my job and at home--or because I'm so tired when I get home, I don't want to think about it. The weekends are different though. That's probably why you'll notice I post more on the weekends than during the week. I have to be having a really bad day in order to post. Guess that's the news reporter in me--the worse it is, the better a story it makes. "If it bleeds, it leads," my journalism prof. taught us. Today it was the screams. All day, in my head and in my chest, bursting to come out. Screams and the urge to throw things. A bit of anger, maybe. There's jealousy, too, in part because today is the first Saturday after our township's graduation (Jr. High and Sr. High), and it seems like every other house is having a party. My daughter got invited to a big party, having just got out of Jr. High, and she stayed for almost 7 hours. She said she left because she was afraid I wanted her to come home--most of the other kids were still there. Great, now I have guilt, too. My mother was invited to a BBQ at a friend-from-work's house, too. But this lady lives almost an hour away, and my mother was very tired after working all day in a less-than-suitable climate for a Nordic woman with high blood pressure, so she basically came home, put on her PJ's and flopped in front of the AC for the rest of the evening. I wish I'd known that my daughter would be out so long. I literally spent the day inside by the phone waiting for her to call. The least she could have done was call me and let me know she'd be staying for X amount of time. I could have went to church to serve in the nursery like I was supposed to do tonight, but I didn't know when she would need me to pick her up. I also wanted to go grocery shopping, too. Now I missed all the weekly sales. And having to stay home with my mother totally ruined my evening. I decided to do some cooking, and right when I'm in the middle of some complicated part of the recipe (chopping something, pouring, or whatever), that's when she decides she needs me for something. Not to mention she's 1. hard of hearing, 2. has the AC on full blast, and 3. has the TV on full blast, too--so when I holla back, she doesn't hear and calls for me AGAIN AND AGAIN until I show up. She said she didn't go to her party because she didn't want to leave me alone. I said PLEASE leave me alone! I get more work done when I'm by myself. When others are home, I feel like I need to be available to take care of THEM. I know the real reason, though. For some strange reason, she hates to be alone, and she doesn't like to go to social gatherings by herself. Not to mention there's no way she would have found this lady's house without my help--too many turns down back roads and whatnot. I did NOT want to go. I realized tonight that I have NEVER been invited INDIVIDUALLY to a party since high school--MAYBE. Perhaps the shindigs they throw at my jobs, but that's it. Almost always, I am part of "Mom and Family," not just "ME." Even my daughter gets invited to parties by herself. My mother has so many friends at her job, and even at the gym where she takes water-aerobics, she makes so many friends they are always inviting her over to parties, BBQ's, out to dinner, what have you. ME, all my "friends" come with the territory. I had "friends" when I was at my jobs, but when the jobs ended (for them or for me), so did the "friendship." There are a few people I still keep in contact with via e-mail, but it's not the same. One of them lives less than 5 miles away, and she's the one that used to watch my daughter for me at times, and she's also the one that e-mails me the least, forget getting invited to social occasions. Even my "friends" from church keep me at arm's length. Sure, we e-mail, and we say "HI" if we see each other at service, and there's the "reunions" at the annual Women's Retreat, but God forbid I get invited over for dinner, or out to lunch, or to a social event of any kind. It's laughable, really. I'll be one of those people who, at my funeral, people will say what a nice person I was, blah blah blah, and who among them will be able to truly say they were MY FRIEND. I don't have anyone to chit-chat with on the phone. I don't have that "circle of friends" everyone else seems to have. I know I'm not alone in this feeling, and I also know that there are others who perhaps have reached out to me to be their friend, but they weren't MY ideal, so I blow them off. Maybe I'm just afraid of getting close to someone again. Like at my new job--I'm happy just to go to work, sit in my cute little cubby, ask for help if I need it, but basically just stay to myself. One girl there keeps trying to get chummy with me, and it annoys the ever-lovin' begeebers out of me. I guess I've decided not to make friends at work anymore, because of my past experiences. This one girl, I worked side by side with her for several years. We shared just about every personal turmoil you can imagine, on and off the job. But when she left, it was like she fell off the planet. She never even reciprocated when I sent her a Christmas card (she doesn't have a PC, so e-mail is out). So that's where the aforementioned jealousy comes in. When I graduated college back in May, I thought it was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I wanted everyone to celebrate with me. I wanted a PARTY. My siblings and cousins and everyone I can think of (maybe with the exception of my mother) had big parties celebrating their happiness when they got married, when their kids got christened, etc. When I got married, it was a friggin' joke. I had to beg people to come, practically, and most who came thought--I might venture to say, knew--it was the biggest mistake of my life, so forget celebrating it. I just want people to be happy for ME, to be happy to be part of my life. So when I see others celebrating, I get sick inside, because I want that for me, or at least, I want to be invited. When I graduated, I know others had parties--I had to host MY own graduation "party"--me, my mother and daughter, at a local restaurant I happened to win a gift certificate to. Figures, at the table next to us was about a couple of people from my class celebrating with about a dozen family and friends. Everyone I wanted to come to my special day either couldn't or wouldn't, or made excuses.  This is one of the things I miss about the drug. I never thought about stuff like this before. Stuff like this never upset me when I was on it. I didn't care about anything, and I guess it was worth it to me, to sacrifice the happy feelings for the sake of NOT having to feel the not-so-happy feelings. I know I should be grateful for what I do have, and be happy for these other people, "rejoice with those who rejoice" and all that. But what happens when no one rejoices with me? And what about the second part of that verse, "mourn with those who mourn?" Whose there when I need to vent and spew? Whose there to listen to my grievances and weary complaints. Like my mother--she calls me from work, for the sole purpose of complaining about it. I'm sorry, but I can't fix it, so LEAVE ME ALONE please--I have other things I need to do, I can't stand hear listening to you WHINE. You're the one who taught ME not to whine, so where's the example I'm supposed to follow? UGH. If I ever get that way with my daughter, I hope she puts me in a home. I guess that's part of the reason I started this blog--as a way to keep me sane while I go through this mess. I need somewhere to vent, and it doesn't even matter if anyone out there reads this or not. I don't think anyone even does--who the heck is that bored, that they go looking at other people's blogs? To me, this is just a handy online diary. I always communicate better when I'm writing than when I'm talking, anyway. I like the way you can go back and change what you wrote before someone else reads it. When you talk, you can't take back what you said before someone hears it. You might say something the wrong way, or someone will take it the wrong way and get all bent, and forget about trying to convince them that's not what you meant (BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, PROBABLY GOING BACK SOMEDAY). Besides, my thoughts come so fast, the pen is too slow for me anymore. Thank God I took that typing class back in High School. It was part of a future secretaries program at the time--who would have guessed today it would be SOP in the business world?  Well, I'm running out of steam, my daughter has gone to sleep with visions of teen-dreams running through her head, and I know by now my mother is snoring in front of the TV again. I have to go put away all that food I made, and hopefully America's Funniest Home Videos is on at midnight. It's the only show I REALLY like to watch on a regular basis anymore. Perhaps it's because it makes me feel better about myself--no matter what stupid thing I've ever done in my life, at least it was NEVER broadcast on national TV! Thank God for things like that!

      The roller coaster is back on in full swing. I went from the verge of tears to the edge of hysteria and back again in a matter of minutes. And all while I was at work. How embarrassing. Thank God I work in a little cubby by myself, and I don't have to talk or interact with too many people. And thank God my job entails a lot of walking. I felt like I was on another old friend, Oxyfast. I was given that after my gastric bypass surgery, and I held onto it when I didn't need it for pain anymore. It gave me lots of energy, as long as I was vertical and moving. I was bouncing down the stairs (I'm not ambitious enough yet to try bouncing UP them) and trotting down the hall at a mile a minute--a lovely BRISK walk, if I do say so myself. Unfortunately, another effect of Oxyfast is when I stop moving, I come to a grinding halt in more ways than one. I literally fell asleep at my desk while proofing a brochure. I kept waking and dozing over the course of about an hour. Like I said, thank God I work pretty much alone. I would have burst out singing if the Spirit hadn't given me a double-dose of self-control. I just get a song in my head, and then it's in my heart and HAS to come out. But I manage to keep it inside--I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but it definately helps you keep your job, I'm sure. Then downstairs at my job is a plasma-screen TV, showing President Reagan's funeral, and I almost burst out crying. Don't get me wrong--having grown up in the 80's and being very proud of it, Reagan was MY President, and I was sad to hear of his passing, but I don't think it merits public tears, especially on the job. Yet I was THIS CLOSE. Now here I am up at midnight again. I just spent the past two hours cooking. What am I doing cooking at 10pm??? I bought marked-down poultry, and we don't have room in the freezer, so I figured, what the hey? Now I'm still up, and I know I will have a hard time getting up for work tomorrow. I just wish I knew of a way to find an emotional balance somehow, without chemical assistance.  Under the Prozac, I had NO emotions. NONE. AT ALL. When someone died, when my mother was angry, when my daughter was in trouble, when the nation received bad news, I was like, "So?" and went on with my life, and wondered why no one else could do the same? Now, I find myself in stitches watching reruns of "America's Funniest Home Videos." I get tears when I see a baby, especially when it's doing something really cute. I so don't wanna be here. I want to find the middle ground, where I can express grief, joy, anger, surprise, etc., when they are appropriate. The worst part so far, is that the old tape-recorder has kicked back in, and I keep replaying all the wrong things others have done to me. I really enjoyed not remembering that stuff--I thought I was all sorts of forgiving, that I had "dropped them in the sea of forgetfulness" as the LORD would do, but instead I just medicated them into remission. For all my mother does for me, all I can think of is how she steals my underwear, starts eating junk food while I'm cooking a nice dinner, and other STUPID little things that I try to chalk up to "she's older, she's tired, she works hard six days a week to put a roof over our heads, the least I can do is share my stuff with her." But I can't help getting IRKED. She doesn't get it--she feels what's hers in mine, and what's mine is hers. NO, I don't think so. What's MINE is MINE, and you can share, as long as you ASK ME FIRST. I would NEVER think to take something that wasn't mine without asking--that's how I was RAISED by my MOTHER! You see my dilemma here? And people wonder why my DAUGHTER is confused! But I digress--as I am wont to do, so please be patient with me. I'm still trying to be patient with myself.

      It started today. God was merciful to me the past few days, as I went about my business at home and at work. I keep the Christian music on the radio as much as possible, and I have a devotional in my desk at work that I peek at when I get the chance. But I knew it would happen sooner or later. I have been in a touchy mood since I got home from work today. A guy was supposed to come by the house to give me an estimate for clearing the garbage out of my mother's yard, so I left work early to meet him, but he never showed. Never even called. That got me started. I was restless--I started cleaning the house, doing my daughter's chores for her. I watched the clock impatiently, waiting for trash-boy to call or show up. He did neither. I noticed that Lawn Doctor had been by and sprayed the lawn with pesticide. Now I had to keep the stupid dog off the lawn as much as possible. Too bad she had it in her head that my mother, the love of her life, was home, and kept wanting to be outside. Each time she goes out, I have to wipe her down with a wet towel before she comes back in. I hope to GOD she doesn't get sick. Then my mother and my brother both call--I keep thinking it's trash boy, and when it's not, I get into a snit. Mom wants to know if we have noodles and carrots so she can finish making her famous chicken soup. My brother wants my mother, and when he can't get her, he starts chatting with me. I hate chatting with my family. Last night my mother wanted to put me on the phone with my other brother, and I nearly had a fit trying to tell her NO. I made some excuse to her as to why, and she bought it. She has NO idea what I'm going through. NO ONE DOES. Only my prayer partners in this--the pastor's wife, and the guest speaker at the retreat who gave the original testimony (that's if she even remembers who I was). Mom and my daughter get home too late for her to make it to Karate class on time, which means she has to go tomorrow and miss her Youth meeting at church. That really bugs me. Then I have to reload a computer program so I can make a CD for my daughter. My tongue is blue from too much biting it. I put on a happy face for my family and make like I'm OK, but they can't be that stupid. I can feel how phoney I am, and they have to notice.  Inside, I want to scream and hit. Mostly scream. Everything that I managed to sweep under the rug (the Holy Rug of Forgiveness, I called it) came crawling back out and dancing in front of me--all the little things that bug me about my mother, for instance. All the things I asked God to forgive me of--resenting her for this and that, even after all she's done for me. She bought me a car so I could graduate college, and I blow a gasket (on the inside), because she plans on giving one of my good bowls to a lady-friend with cancer (that holds the aforementioned soup). How messed up is that? I acknowledge the feelings are wrong, but they are still there. I write this blog to help me sort my feelings, to get them out of me in a way that won't hurt anyone or give my secret away to those I fear will learn of it the most. I feel like I should be on a talk show--I'll share my deepest, darkest secrets with total strangers on the Internet, but not my own family. I know my mother, you see, and after living with her for the past 6 1/2 years, I think I can safely say that if she knew what I was going through, she would have one of several reactions:  1) she'd blame herself, 2) she'd blame my estranged husband, 3) she'd blame another family member, or 4) she'd blame me. Either way, there would have to be someone to blame, someone for her to get mad at. That's how she handles bad stuff.  This is another symptom of the "disease"--I get easily distracted.  I know I will be OK--I just have to keep reminding myself that until I believe it. I know they are just FEELINGS with NO basis in FACT, yet the FACTS don't make the FEELINGS go away.  I have a headache. I have chest pains. I've had weird dreams. I can't get to sleep at night, and I can't get up in the morning. I'd rather daydream about a movie I saw last week or what I did on the retreat (neither of which is a pleasant thing, mind you) than get dressed for work. I have sat on the bed, pants on, shirt off, one sock on, holding the other one, just staring into space for 5-10 minutes, thinking about LORD knows what.  I hope I get a job as a writer someday. I could do this for hours on end--now I just have to find someone willing to pay me to do it. Any takers?

      I never realized that I had a problem with Prozac. Until I went to a Women's Retreat with my church, Calvary Chapel of Old Bridge, NJ.  I had started taking it when I decided I had had enough of the emotional roller coaster I had been on for so many years, since my husband left and kept trying to come back, since I gave up my second daughter in adoption to my less-than-perfect in-laws.  I had always been a bit emotional, but I was afraid that they were getting the best of me. I had too much to do--a full-time job, going back to school, being a single mother. I had no time for emotions. No time to sit back and cry or laugh or yell or scream. So when I heard about a woman at my old job who used Prozac, and all the jokes and anecdotes about it, I decided to see what I could do to get my hands on some. Lucky for me, I had a Dr. at the time who was pretty much RX central. All you had to do was ask, and he wrote you prescriptions for whatever you felt like you needed. It took a while for it to kick in, but soon I didn't feel like crying as much anymore. It was especially a relief when I was thrust into extremely emotional situations--facing my estranged husband at child-support hearings and supposed attempts at reconcilliation, visits to my second daughter's home and her visits to me.  When I lost my job, I was already on state medical, so I was able to keep my Rx's and therefore my Prozac. At least I had that to lean on. I never realized how strong a hold it had on me, until I went to the retreat and heard the testimony of women who had been enslaved by the drug and how they escaped. It took a while for the message to sink in, but when the pastor's wife described what another woman had told her, how it was to be on Paxil, how you get emotionally stirred, and you want to cry, but you can't--it described what I was going through, and it struck me like a truck. All this time I thought I was the one in control of my emotions. When I was faced with trying times, I went into them head-on, no fear, no tears. When others around me were falling apart, I looked down on them in disgust. I came to despise those who cried at funerals, sad stories on the news and in movies, over their personal problems that I could relate to, but didn't see what the big deal was. I now realize that I was not strong at all--I was a slave to the drug. For not only did it rob me of my tears, it took my laughter as well. I confessed to the pastor's wife after the service--"I haven't had a real emotion in the past 4 years."  I used to go to the retreats for an emotional release, to get myself right with God and my fellow human.  It was a place I could go be as emotional as I wanted to be, and the past few years, I actually looked forward to it. I actually hoped I would cry, and each year I came away as empty as I went in. I never placed the blame on the drug, though. I started to fear that I had become so far from God that He couldn't touch my heart anymore. There is a part in the Bible that says something to that effect, and if I was a better Christian, I'd know it. I realized that my reasons for taking the drug had fallen far short of the noble idea of not being an emotional jellyfish, as I feared I was. Rather, I had come to despise the tears. I hated them, in myself and others. I saw them as a sign of weakness. Everytime I saw someone get emotional--the pastor's wife, my children, even my mother--I couldn't help feeling "Oh, please, grow up already." I confessed this to the pastor's wife and made a commitment before her and God that I would give up the drug. I went back to my room and flushed the next day's dose down the toilet. I felt that was that.  But when I got home, I looked up Prozac on the Internet, and learned about the dangers and horror stories associated with Prozac withdrawal, especially cold turkey, as I had chosen. I grew trepidacious, but I was still determined to do this, with God's help. I believe He wants me off this stuff, and He will never ask me to do something He will not see me through. I asked for prayer and started praying again myself. I tried to get back into a habit of Bible reading and listening to Praise music, to prepare my mind for the battle ahead. I started to feel God's love and comfort within, and I know that no matter what happens from this moment on, I will not be alone in it.

						   " It's something unpredictable, but in the end, it's right. I hope you had the time of your life ."                                      ---"Good Riddance", Green Day   Boy, this is corny. But even before I graduated, I wanted to start a blog about my life as a re-entering student to college. But I got so busy, between schoolwork, part-time work, housework, and shirking work (a girl's gotta rest, ya know), I let it slip by. My Magazine Writing professor tells me that I am a true writer, because I postpone writing as long as possible! Like many other writers, I love to do it, but I never get to it!  My life has changed so much in the past month or two. It was like a whirlwind romance that was over too soon and too fast. Before I knew it, it was cap-and-gown time, and the world of college life, that I loved so dearly, that I was so grateful to be a part of again, came to a screeching halt. I wore my cap and gown most of Graduation Day. I had three--no, four--different sets of professional pictures taken. I almost wore my class ring to bed. I still have a "Congratulations Grad" banner hanging on the front of the house. I figure, Graduation Season doesn't really end until the middle of June, when all the high-schoolers get done, so I'm gonna milk this like Christmas. Only, unlike Christmas, this time will never come again. I guess that was part of the allure of going back to school--it gave me something to strive for, to hope for, a goal to be achieved. Now I've achieved it. I finished the race. And only because I kept the faith. Not only that, but my months of job searching before graduation paid off, and I had the "job of my dreams" before I even marched across campus. I still remember that day like it was today. I will always remember. Even though my mother took 200 pictures of me standing in the same spot for an hour, and not much of anything else. Even though my poor daughter got stuck with the video camera, and out of a 4-hour ordeal, maybe got 20 minutes on tape. I hope someday they come up with a way to plug something into your head and record your memories onto video. I want to keep them fresh, like the dozen red roses my mother ordered for me that day, and we spent the better part of my last hour on TCNJ's campus hunting them down when they weren't delivered with my diploma-case as my mother had assumed they would be (they finally turned up in the Biology Dept., in a building I had never been in before, a building that didn't even exist when I was here the first time).  I didn't want to leave. I know most of my fellow graduates couldn't wait to get off campus for the last time, and I can't say as I blame them. But that's because they don't know. They are still young and, no matter what they did on or off campus for the past four years, they are still quite innocent to the ways of the world. How many of them are going home to an empty house or apartment? How many of them have to worry about rent/mortgages, utilities, car payments, insurances (life, car, health, home), and the like? How many of them had to rush home to pick up their kids from school and make them dinner? How many of them are dealing with broken hearts and memories of loved ones that should have been there, but couldn't be (or wouldn't be)? I remember during the speech from the class president (I think), and she made a comment about, "some say college years are the best years of your life, but that's not so. The best years are just beginning." I couldn't help but smile ever so smugly and mutter, "No, kids, this is pretty much it. The fun's over--time to join the Real World." And this ain't no MTV sponsored gig either. The comic strip "Non-Sequitor" showed it the best--in a Sunday strip, it showed the average graduation scene, kids tossing their caps in the air, running out into the big wide world, diplomas in hand, still in their gowns, shouting "Here we come, world!" And the world was waiting for them--a banner hung in the street outside the college saying "Welcome New Grads"--only "grads" had been crossed out and replaced with "meat."  The grad stared in shock at the bums in the street, the crooks on the sidewalk, the horrific headlines proclaiming the sad state of our society and our world. You can't blame them for their reactions--the final panel shows them racing back to college to enroll in Grad School. My dear mother offered me that option. She wanted to know if I wanted to go back and get my Master's after I got my Bachelor's. I figured, what for? Just to say I have it? It's not like I can get a better job with it. Heck, most of the job listings I've seen over the past two-and-a-half years I've been in school dangle that darn "BA required" in front of the employment starved populace like a cruel parent to a hungry child--"you can't have dinner until you clean your room, vacuum the halls, do the dishes, clean out the garage, paint the house, mow the lawn, resurface the driveway..." But I did it. I took me way too long, but I did it. And now the door to the world of college has been slammed firmly behind me, whether I like it or not. I don't know if I can go to homecoming--it's not that I don't want to. For some reason, I feel like it's not my world anymore. I don't think it ever was, these past 18 months, as much as I tried to make it mine again. It was my world, from Sept. 1986-Dec. 1989. I was young, no real responsibilities, healthy and strong, no one to take care of or account to, the world at my feet. This time around, I had to be off campus by 2pm to be home for my daughter at 3pm. No more 8pm movies in the dorm lounge. No more dinners at the Rat. No more late-nights with Domino's Pizza. I couldn't even help out at the college paper like I really wanted, because they met to assign their stories and do the editing on Sunday nights. No way I was driving all the way out to campus on a Sunday night. Used to be, Friday at 10pm, I'd just be getting ready to get my fun on. This time around, 10pm usually found me in a tiny cubicle in Old Bridge, NJ, asking someone if they wanted to talk about their acid reflux. But I tried. I volunteered to help with a few campus groups, I wrote for the college paper a few times, and I even got to attend a regular Bible study for a whole semester. I bought the shirts and stickers and books and everything to make me look like a college student. But there was no hiding it. I was almost always the second oldest person in the room at every class I took. One semester I was THE oldest person (my aforementioned Mag. Writing prof is a year younger than me). Don't get me wrong--the kids never made me feel old and out of place. They were extremely and surprisingly cordial and courteous to me. Most times, they treated me like one of their own, or at least they tried to. I was the one in the mental walker, shuffling through academia like I didn't belong there. And my professors seemed to like me for that fact--someone they could relate to, who remembers the same things they do, who understands some of the references they used. Come to think of it, the only group of kids I had a problem with were the very ones I wanted to be a part of the most--the college paper. I volunteered every chance I could, and I asked them to email me story leads on Monday AMs that I could follow up on during my week at TCNJ, but soon I guess they got tired of me asking, or maybe my last story got in to late--for all the ads they ran, begging people to write for them, when I offered my services, I got a cold shoulder. Oh well. My only regret there is, when I go to get a writing job, the only examples I have to show them are my class assignments. I hope that's enough. Here's another problem with being a writer--when I DO get going, it's kinda hard to stop! I never did a BLOG before, so if this isn't the norm, OH WELL. This is the norm FOR ME. I go for days, sometimes weeks, without writing, and it builds and builds within me, until finally I settle myself down before the keyboard, and next thing you know, it's an hour later, and my fingers are just getting warmed up. But I have to get up early M-F to put my kid on the bus and get ready for work. Besides, Letterman's on in ten minutes. I don't know what good any of this will do in the long run, but for now, it makes me feel better, and that's good enough for me.
