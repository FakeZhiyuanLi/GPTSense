      calling a small, mostly rural Southern town my home has lead me to refrain from generating high hopes about good cinema invading. hence, i was not surprised to learn that "fahrenheit 9/11" would not be gracing jesup, GA with its brutal honesty. i was, however, mildly shocked to see savannah avoid showing the film. a friend of mine in kahootz with some activists over there says he believes there was definitely a concerted effort to keep the film out.  well, i meant i was going to see it on opening night. this desire drove me to order advance online tickets for myself and four friends to see the latest moore-u-mentary in the closest viewing area - jacksonville, FL. of course we were excited on the drive down, of course we donned our political pins, and of course we had mixed expectations. i mean, a palm d'ohr, while a highly valued film award, doesn't exactly translate into public instasuccess.  i knew i'd enjoy the film. i knew i'd definitely be moved by the film; but i had no idea to what degree until i was sitting in the theatre. as the crowd poured in, we scanned the demographics. we saw a mostly-younger crowd, ranging from about 17 to 35, with the exception of a few older folks. one conservatively-dressed, approaching-60-year-old-woman exclaimed to me in the ladies' room just before my viewing, "it was fabulous. you're going to love it."   the crowd was insanely huge. as we looked around during the pre-movie quizzes and blurbs, we couldn't pick out very many empty seats, if any; and we were at the last showing of the night. as soon as the film began, i was hooked. the range of emotions elicited from myself and my viewing partners was unpredictable. there were times when i thought to myself, "ok, where's he going with this? is this just a clipcollage with no purpose?" then it would make sense.   there's really no preparing oneself to view this movie. you just have to do it. one of my friends said he thought it should be required viewing for school kids. i definitely agree. i really don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who's yet to experience it, but i will say that the raw footage and the absolutely explicit emotions captured in the documentary completely enveloped me. it really took a few minutes to snap out of the haze after we walked out of the theatre. nothing could be said that would justify speaking at that point.  no one even swooped in for comic relief until after an understood period of time. afterwards, of course, we went to denny's and laughed about britney spears's dumbass. nick said something along the lines of, "imagine if you were britney spears and you went to this premiere, then all of a sudden you see yourself onscreen looking like an idiot." gotta hand it to moore, his wit and satire definitely add to his relevance as a filmmaker.  will i see the film again? definitely. i may not drive back to jacksonville to see it. i hope i won't have to. i hope that i'll be seeing in my own hometown of jesup. at least, that's what i'll be campaigning for.

      i've discovered radioAOL and let me tell you, never thought i'd be enjoying such classics as the theme from Tootsie at 8 o'clock on a monday morning. well, never thought i'd be doing it before the age of 42.  today marks the one month countdown of my move to california. how pumped am i? i'd say very. i had the potentially awkward but pleasantly enjoyable dinner with my future roommate's parents saturday night. it was great. his dad and i talked about adventure, travel, and degrassi. as a substitute teacher before he got his degree, he used to show episodes of degrassi in school! it officially marked him as one of my heroes. i then explained degrassi: the new generation to him and his step-daughter. they seemed intrigued.  so after the dinner, which i have to say is highly meaningful since i met the parents before i met the roommate, i went on to purge my parents' house of any toxins, then went to best friend nick's house. we had some out-of-town homeys breeze in, faux-spontaneously since it was planned and i knew about it. ok, i just wanted to say faux.  i drank my first piranha and it kept me up until 9 a.m. sunday morning. oh you came in with the breee-eeeeze...ok anyway. six of us embarked on an adventure, probably not particularly significant in the scheme of things, but highly relevant to our town and our states of mind saturday night.  call us rebels. it would be an overstatement, but you can still call us that. let's just say we changed some townspeople's opinion of a certain upcoming holiday, which has now passed. confused? yeah we were too, which made it even more spectacular. it was a jive-ass, donkey-kartin' good time, as josh would say.  i'm off in an hour or so to empty the rest of the contents from my five-year stint in the 'boro into a big truck, a big trailer, and a big expectation.  san dimas high school football rules!

      scenario: hanging out at a good friend’s house watching a little live portishead, basically just waiting for 11 pm. I was supposed to call my friend in north hollywood after 11 and talk to him about the possibility of cohabitation.  the verdict: I’m going to inhabit a “mother-in-law” attached to his house. how pumped am i? not only am I able to stop the remote apartment hunt, but now I can concentrate my efforts on the job hunt.  i was on the front porch of my friend kayvon’s house when i talked through the whole living sitch with future-roommate john. When I returned to the house where high definition sevilla soccer dominated, everyone turned and looked at me and I couldn’t contain myself. I felt so relieved and excited that I actually experienced tears of joy. My friend ashlee grabbed me and hugged me and “yaaaayed” and “awwwed” with me. then kayvon kept telling me how happy he was for me. it was hard to sit back down on the couch and watch soccer after that.  Not only will I be living with john, but also with a big, sweet dog named charlie, which will definitely be a new experience for me. i’ll have my own bedroom, bathroom, and living room. John described the neighborhood as cleaver-esque and said he knew I’d love it. I have no doubt.  It’s about 20 mins from west hollywood, which will be nice since my only other friend in l.a. lives in that area. Now I guess it’s back to more of the last two-days’ effort of packing...but first, I think I’ll finish watching that portishead dvd.

      thanks to my west coast chica, Em, i'm now with blog.  turning 23 was almost as anti-climactic as turning 22, but at least consists of two different digits. i'm getting ready for my last exam here at our lovely university, out of which came "the vagina monologues," pseudo-protestors, and an overhead-flying bald eagle at the graduation ceremony. i'm off after the exam to...yet another south georgia location.  of course i'll be back here in a few days to de-mandify the mobile home that has hosted my (in)sanity for the past five years. i can't imagine packing up my life and hauling it out of here in the civic and my best friend's jimmy. however, i can imagine unpacking it in sunny california. until then, i'll hover in this state of limbo. i think some fierce events will make the state of transition easier...like the rumored sayonara soiree that the pals are planning. that should make for a fabulous time.  on the other side of limbo, there's my friend in noho who has offered his extra bedroom and bathroom to me. (what a guy). sadly, my budget is not noho-ready. i've got some leads on a couple of apartments, and my aforementioned friend Em and her gracious fella have offered to check one out for me. i'm excited about that.  well, for now, i'll return to mindlessly tracking the progress of ross and rachel in season two and haphazardly committing to memory the practices of the sikhs.

      One of the myriad advantages of living in L.A. (saying that I live in L.A. still sounds foreign by the way) is the tendency for movies, even indies, to actually appear on screens on their release dates. Case in point -  Donnie Darko : The Director’s Cut. I’ve been waiting for this one. I still remember the first time I saw  Donnie Darko . Jeremiah (one of my bestest friends) had the Woogster and myself over for the movie at his dear, sweet old apartment on Lucy Lane.  We popped popcorn, grabbed some beers, and settled in to watch this brain-twister. That night I was afraid my dreams would be plagued with crazy purple Satan bunnies, but I got Woog to sleep on the floor in my room so I wouldn’t be too freaked out.  That was a couple summers ago I guess. Now The Director’s Cut is in select theatres and luckily it selected L.A. I was having a pretty ill day - just not feeling good and getting sick of staring at boxes with no hope of emptying them until serious furniture arrangement ensued, when I decided I’d go see the flick today. Mom wanted to come despite my best efforts to warn her against it.  We went over to Sherman Oaks and watched the movie. It was incredible. I’m really glad they re-released it. When we left the theatre, which was packed with a whopping attendance of 12, Mom didn’t say anything. As we were walking up the sidewalk back at the house she said, "So...that was intense."  Indeed.   So far things at the house have been great. Tonight when John got in we did the furniture arrangement so now, nothing stands between me and a whole lotta unpackin’, which commences at....whatever time I wake up...sharp.  As for other neighborhood happenings, John found a little wandering dog outside yesterday and took him in. He got me to make flyers about him with his picture and we walked him around and put the signs up on poles. He whined and cried like a baby all night last night, which sucked because he had to stay in my part of the house so that overzealous Charlie (unaware of his massive size and intimidation factor) wouldn’t sniff him inappropriately.  The dog’s crying broke my heart enough to upset me, but not enough for me to invite him to sleep with me. He smelled really bad. But, he escaped from the backyard today so we don’t know where he is. Hopefully he found the old lady’s lap that he escaped from.  Yesterday was pretty eventful, what with the dog and me swimming through a crowd of teenie boppers on the Ryan Seacrest show. I’ve never been a huge fan of the guy, but I got tickets for my parents and me because I thought it would be fun. We got to the Hollywood Highland Complex mega-early and there were already about 500 under-clothed over-sexed young girls waiting in line to see Miss Ashlee Simpson. There was no way we were getting inside the studio.  I’d stayed up pretty late the night before making a huge pink neon poster that said: "NICK AND MALLORY: WHERE’S THE RECEIPTS?" so I wasn’t quite ready to admit the defeat of non-entry into the studio.  After this trendy little mister added up the number of line-standers, he sent everyone home who wouldn’t fit into the studio. He should talk more quietly to security guards. I heard him say that he hadn’t told the remaining crowd that they were bringing Ryan and Ashlee out for an outside segment because he didn’t want to get us "any more worked up." Haha. Suckah.  So I decided to stand about three girls back behind those little rails they put up to block people off of sets. I was eyeing these two little Spanish women who were deliberating on whether or not to stay. I heard them say they were leaving so I quickly pounced into their position at the front of the rail. Soon after, some prop guys set up two chairs right in front of me.  I met some twins from Virginia who were wearing these t-shirts that said, "These twins are Dyin’ for Ryan." How cute. They got excited when I came up next to them because they knew we were sure to be on camera since I had a poster. "Oh they love posters on this show," one said. She went on to say that they watch the show every day.   "Oh, I’ve never seen it," I said, after which I was given a confused look. The twin went on to say, "Ryan’s really cute. He’s just...way too old."  "Oh, how old is he?" I asked. "26" she said. My mouth dropped open. I asked how old they were and she said, "16." I said that I was 23, to which she replied, "Ohhhhh...I’m sorry." And there you have it: I was dubbed old. Of course for this crowd, I definitely was. I’d say I was the only one representing my demographic.  When Ryan and Ashlee did come out, the twins were right: we were right on camera. I was glad because I wanted Nick and Mallory to see the sign. I didn’t care about anything else. Ok, ok, I’ll admit: I did care about Ashlee’s belt and shoes which were really cute. But that was an after-care, not a preliminary one.  So, Nick and Mallory both saw the show and the sign I made them and that made me happy. Also, the twins told stories of how they’ve been on several other shows, including "The Today Show." Apparently they’re like this traveling studio audience family. Humorous.

      So I woke up Thursday morning, got dressed and ready, only to receive a phone call saying the auto people had shipped the wrong part, and I may or may not get the part later on that night. Being only two hours away from my new address, I was frantic, hyper, and restless. I just wanted to get there. The ‘rents and I decided to suck it up and just drive in the 100 degree heat with no air conditioning. With all four windows down, the cd player’s headphones firmly attached to my ears, and a scarf catching flyaway hairs, I traveled on.  I arrived at John’s house a little before two in the afternoon, and I was admittedly (and probably obviously) nervous. He greeted me at the door with a hug and a "it’s nice to finally meet you." Then Charlie Brown greeted me - a big semi-shaggy blonde puppy dog. Both were adorable. We brought in the bags and looked around the place.  My living room was really cute - fireplace, built-in bookshelves, hardwood floors, mission style tables, the works. The bedroom looked overtaken by the big queen-size bed, but I didn’t care. That just means I get a big bed :) Immediately John told us of a friend of his who did mechanics in Hollywood, so he led us there before he had to go to work.  The mechanic had pet turtles. Weird, but cool. Mechanic Paul said he’d have the Civ in cooling condition the next morning. I was still kind of in awe of all of the newness. Hollywood was fun, not near as huge and loud as I’d expected.  We spent the next morning walking around town, going to Hollywood and Highland, which was fun. I took lots of pictures for the gang back home. John called me from work when we’d returned to the house and asked if I wanted to go out when he got off.  Of course I did. He took me over to West Hollywood so I could see what that was all about. I immediately fell in love with it. We saw some friends of his along the way. We ended up dining outside at this cute little restaurant and swapping bonding stories. He took me to a little clothing shop that was very nice (read: expensive), and then we went to The Abbey. What a gorgeous place.   I met a friend of his there, and a friend of HIS and we all hung out and talked. John said I must have a drink on my first night out on the town, so I chose a Coconut Mojito. Yeah, bad decision. Tasted like pure alcohol...but, halfway through, I said, "Hey, this just got GOOD!" Yeah, it was strong.  We spotted a few celebrities, which was of course exciting for me. We saw John Turturro, Wilson Cruz (Ricky from "My So-Called Life"), the girl from "Hairspray" and we met a bartender who was in "Dodgeball" (he played Blade). Highly eventful night for celeb and pseudo-celeb sightings.  John and I arrived back home exhausted and both crashed hard. Saturday brought a day at The Grove, a mall in Hollywood. Then I stayed up late Saturday night, solo in the living room (which is serving as my bedroom until the ‘rents fly out) looking at pictures and writing a couple of letters. Not having internet has well, just been an inconvenience. I’m completely web-spoiled.  Sunday brought....*gasp* the movers!!!!!!!!! And they had my stuff!!!! All of it!!!! And nothing was broken!!!! Are you kidding me? The excessive exclamation marks should’ve clued you in to the amount of sarcasm dripping from the sentences. And if it didn’t, well, I’m blatantly stating it now. Yes, they had all my stuff. Was some of it broken? Of course. Were the six-foot collage panels intact? Luckily. So I was happy.   My part of the house is now a maze of boxes. I’ve already rearranged the bedroom, got some clothes in the chest and closet, and pulled out a few pictures and put on the bench, but other than that, it’s still all Rubbermaid around here. Hopefully I’ll get my big bookshelf assembled tonight or tomorrow, and that will eliminate a lot of boxes seeing as how they’re mostly book-filled.  After all the moving fun, we had tickets to the opera - "A Little Night Music" and Stephen Sondheim was actually supposed to be there. John and I were both too tired to go, however, so we just loaded up the fam and went to eat dinner. We got back and watched "Six Feet Under" and "Entourage" then we were both too sleepy for any further activity.  As for today, well, it brought my very first job interview. It was actually in Sun Valley so that wasn’t too far away. It seemed kind of shady in location, but the more questions I answered at the interview, the more I was led to believe that that was not the location from which I would be working if hired. They’re supposed to call me back by Friday one way or the other, so we’ll see :)  Right now, I’m just basking in the glory that is internet, and trying to decide what to unpack next. As if there were any question, I love it here. John is amazing. I don’t even mind the cats. The house is insanely gorgeous and immaculately decorated (of course), and I’m content. It feels right here.

      Exit Grants, New Mexico and enter Arizona (yesterday). Again, gorgeous place. I haven’t found a state yet that hasn’t totally captivated me, cheesy as it sounds. Arizona was fun. Umm mainly because I went to Grand Canyon!!! Yeah, indescribable...not even gonna try.  After purchasing some cliche touristy items from the gift shop after seeing the majesty, we were ready to head to the next destination. Hands down, favorite moment from the trip so far: as we’re leaving, Dad says, “Let’s Bogart this joint.” I stopped dead in my tracks, staring blankly. I said, “Umm, Daddy, do you have any idea what that means?”  He said, “Yeah, it means let’s get out of here.” Me, “Nnnno. It means, ‘Hey! Let’s hoard all this weed and not share it!’”  So by this point I’m giggly, thinking of my dad discussing any type of illegal substance. We argued for a bit over the meaning of Bogart, but all in good fun. I kept giving him a hard time. As we walked into our hotel room that night, I said, “Daddy?”  Dad, “Yeah?” Me, “Remind me never to smoke weed with YOU.”  So that’s still a good laugh. Onto today. Today, today, today. Well, it’s been eventful, that’s for sure. We overslept a bit, not in too much of a hurry because we were only about 300 miles away from the destination. Just as we crossed the California line and started across the Mohave Desert... the air conditioner crapped out. Could it BE any more perfect? Of course I enjoyed the irony of the situation, but that didn’t stop me from sweating.  We made it to Barstow, the next town that amounted to anything and stopped at a mechanic. Sweet, it could be fixed by some kind of new vacuum and thirty minutes’ time. Well, just kidding. Upon further inspection, it turns out that the compressor had turned to absolute goo. It was sparking and trying to catch on fire. Awesome.  So, the thirty minutes that Dad had spent with the mechanic and that Mom and I had spent in the adjoining Mobil store, had all been in preparation for the fact that we were still one day away from L.A.  The Mobil store was an adventure to say the least. I rudely talked loudly on my cell phone as customer upon customer scurried around the no-more-than ten by ten foot store. I checked out displays of Corn Nuts, Jerky, and even spotted some “Steak Nuggets” with “Low Carb Attitude.” Out of control.  Randall, the resident checker-outer was quite a character. A weathered, mustached, tattooed man, Randall had quite a sense of humor. He also had a voice similar to the one Jim Carrey used in “The Cable Guy.” The phone rang behind the counter and Randall yelled out, “HEL-lo, Pete’s Slaughterhouse, youuuuuuuuu stab ‘em, weeeeeeeeeeeeee slab ‘em....ahem, ‘Hello, Mobil?’” Entertaining for sure.  So here I sit, taking full advantage of the free DSL at yet another Holiday Inn Express, just awaiting the no doubt fabulous cuisine to come out of the BUN BOY across the street. Yes, I said BUN BOY.   Tomorrow, pending no further adventure, I WILL arrive at my new address.

      I alas departed the hometown of the one-and-only Mr. Garth Brooks today, and headed for bigger, broader territory. That’s right, kids: Tejas. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee haw! We stopped in Amarillo for a few minutes. That’s the only memorable town I can think of right now. The scenery (still) was gorgeous. I’m just in love with looking out the window, I tell ya what.   I got a cool turquoise turtle ring in Tejas, along with lots of postcards. Oh! Before we left Oklahoma, I got a magnet of every state that we’ve traveled through and/or are going to travel through, so that was fun and dorky.   After Tejas was history, New Mexico was next, and I’m still there now, actually. We’re spending the night in Grants, which is a little past Albuquerque. There was a killer storm a’brewin’ before we got to Albuquerque. I got some pretty cool pictures of it. For a minute there, I thought we might be looking at some whirlwind action, but luckily, none commenced.   When we stopped in Alb for dinner, our waiter bore an uncanny resemblence to John Denver. Almost immediately after we sat down, this young Mexican guy kind of yelled/sung out, "Take me HOME country ROADS" and then his table died laughing. It was pretty funny. The waiter inquired about our trip and then said, "Oh I moved to Hollywood when I was 21...well, North Hollywood actually, between Burbank and Laurel Canyon." Hmm. How do ya like them apples? He said he lived there for seven years, playing up and down Sunset with his band who was trying to land a record deal. Now, he’s a waiter at Applebee’s in New Mexico.   Well, two more days on the road should land ME in North Hollywood. I’m already starting to get sunburned from the drive! I’ve been advised to invest in some mosquito repellant as well. We’ll see if we can’t find some kind of combo.

       Well, on day 2 of the road trip to California, we’ve landed in Yukon, oklahoma. That’s right, kids: the former hometown of super legend........Garth Brooks. I know, I can hardly believe it myself. We spent the night in Tupelo, Mississippi last night (birthplace of Elvis) and NOW we’ve moved on to Garth Brooks. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. Who’s next? The big-haired lady from the Longhorn commercials??   It’s been a good trip so far; nothing out of the ordinary, which is definitely welcome. I was going to post a few pics from Arkansas and Oklahoma but now I’m tired and don’t feel like being patient...but it seems that the Woogster has gone and fixed one up for me. Oh, a fun tidbit: a guy who’s name was ACTUALLY Gaston helped me out at Wal-Mart in Clarksville, Arkansas today!  Most of my road-time has been spent sleeping and just taking everything in. People have said that the scenery would be boring, but I really haven’t had that feeling at all. The wildflowers on the mountains in Alabama were amazing (who even knew Alabama had mountains??!). Mississippi was pretty similar to Alabama, then I slept through the little bit of Tennessee we actually went through. Arkansas was really farmy and pretty. Tons of trees; more than I expected, actually. Oklahoma was a lot like Arkansas - lots of green, all gorgeous.        I’m almost persuaded to join the green party (and by green party, I just mean my cousin Kim because it’s her favorite color).   Luckily I’ve already been in touch with the guys. I talked to Nick tonight; Kayvon called last night; and I’ve talked to J-Wo, Jackson, Woogie, and Wiley online. Things are good. My only worry at this point surrounds the wildfires in North L.A. county. Hopefully that will get better, though. For now, I’m going to sleep and get ready for another full day on the road. As Garth would say, "Ohhhhh the red strokes" (and if anyone actually enjoys that song, I apologize. Just ask one of my friends the meaning of "I apologize.")

      Thanks to Nick on the crazy drive home this morning, that “saaaaarah, saa-aaarah” song has been stuck in my head all day. What a day, though–my last night spent in my old Jesup home for a while. Tonight my family got together for one final laugh fest (again, for a while at least). And by my family, I mean the core group - the Lori-Lucy-Loretta fam (my mom and her two closest sisters). Aunt Lori gave me an I Love Lucy bag with the four cruisers in the car that said “California, Here we Come” and Aunt Lu gave me a fierce Texas postcard with some dinero. Mallory wrote me a sweet letter with a “surf California” sticker on it. We ate pizza and ice cream cake, laughed and talked, and Mallory commenced with a series of “don’t go”s which got to me. I didn’t really say goodbye to anyone; it was mostly just “see ya later”s that I handed out.  The night before, Thursday night, was the last bigbanghoorahyaaaay in Statesboro. It was the most fun I’ve ever had in my five years in the town. The day started with me anticipating movers, who didn’t show up until six hours after their declared arrival. They were really nice guys, though, and they shrink wrapped my art so I was crunk about that. I felt like my stuff was safe.   Wiley got to the house to pick me up to head over to the ‘boro and I was dreadfully late getting ready. We had a fun ride over there, complete with Philip (who we caravanned with) using hand signals in lieu of blinkers. Comical guy. When I got to Jeremiah, Jackson, and Pip’s house, it was really surreal. I mean, our friends always go all out for parties (usually themed) and that’s just the norm; but this was spectacular. Nick had created a replica of the Hollywood sign that was just...really fierce. He’d painted it and Jeremiah had found the same font used on the actual sign and made the letters. We did pics, portrait style in front of it. There were also other posters, lots of rope lights and balloons, and TONS of homemade delights.  My Roselia (a.k.a. Rose) cooked a fabulous cake and little side cupcakes to adorn it, made entirely vegan on the suggestion of Jennilin. There were also brownies, also homemade, AND my favorite chef Jeremiah made some kick-ass guacamole, which I tried for the first time. The kids went all out. It was immaculate. Nick gave me my going-away slash graduation slash birthday present early on, before too many folks arrived. He’d made me this scrapbook of pics of all of us, mixed with clippings of phrases and pics, collage-style. The last page said “Mandy’s Party Pics” and he used his Polaroid to take lots of pics, then put them in the book after the party.  I was so pumped that so many people showed up. Of course there was an outer fringe of people - friends of friends and such, but I was too much in I-want-to-see-my-best-friends mode to be too terribly butterfly-esque. However that didn’t stop me from announcing to new people, “hi, I’m Mandy. This party’s for me,” which of course, kept Nick entertained. I mostly spent the night hovering between Nick, Rose, Woogie, Wiley, Scot, Dallas & Jesca, Jennilin, my friend Ed who I haven’t seen in ages, and Kayvon. My friends from V-town Lynn-Cee and Crystal came, which rocked; my old chica Rach showed up, my J-town buds the newly-married Jen and Jer came, the other Jen came, and Philski of course came. Chris and Ash hung out; J-Wo, Jackson, and Pip were of course there, since it WAS their house. I’m sure I’m leaving someone out, but it’s late and I’m leaving in a few hours to drive across the country so cut me some slack.  Jason, Kev, and Leslie came - the old art house crew. Jason had made me this gorgeous goblet for graduation, out of which I drank for the night so I’d made him a hemp necklace in return. Kev made me this jive-ass hemp bangle bracelet which I of course have worn ever since. Dallas and Jesca gave me a “Mandy’s fun bus” magnet to put on my fridge when I get to L.A. they also brought this fierce vintage wallpaper sheet for everyone to sign. Woogie kept it interesting by sporting a variety of hats throughout the evening, one of which read simply PEROT. Of course he brought out the memory-laden AC/DC trucker hat, complete with mullet wig underneath. Who doesn’t enjoy a good mullet sighting? I loaded up on addresses, phone numbers, emails and birthdays and everyone of course promised to keep in touch.  People started to trickle away, and the see-ya-laters weren’t that bad at first. Then it got to Kayvon, and that was just tough. Didn’t want to let go. But I did eventually. The night before, we did our last hang-out and he gave me “Easy Rider” on DVD, which I watched for the first time with him on one of our movie nights. He’s going to come visit soon, though, so that will be supersweet.  After Kayvon was Scot. Scot and I just have this excited-wavy friendship that really didn’t allow for mushy-gushy goodbyes. We were just really wired and excited and he made me promise to call him from the grand canyon. Rose’s see-ya-later was really fun because we have this going joke that we’re an old married couple, so she said, “well Mandy when you get to L.A. and show people pictures from the party you can say, ‘that’s rose. She’s my first wife’”!!!!! that girl’s a mess. Hands down, one of THE coolest females on the planet.   The Jeremiah goodbye was sweet, of course, because he’s a sweetheart; but we kept it simple. Jackson refused to be anything other than sleepy and positive, which was fun. Phil was one of the last; after we maneuvered around some douche bag’s car that he left parked in the middle of the drive. So after everyone’s gone, it left Nick, Wiley and me. I hung out with Jeremiah while the other boys cleaned up, then we got ready to hit the road. Well, we couldn’t find Nick’s license so we go over to Rose’s apartment and knock on her window.  Nick - taptaptap, “Rose?” Rose - “Yes?” just very matter-of-factly. It was just hilarious. So after Nick and Rose search her car for the license, they come back in and say, “Look what followed us home.” It was a little gray kitty cat that was crunk as hell. That kitty cat came dancing in the living room, all “MEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.” She was a very in-your-face kinda cat. We finally got her back out (after Rose awkwardly tried to feed her some bread) then she meowed louder than I ever thought cattedly possible. Seriously she sounded like a person saying, “Hey. Guys. Really. Let me back in. I’ll cut you.”  After that, Nick and I had the weirdest drive home. Wiley started out following us, then we had to follow him a bit. Both vehicles almost got slammed by an out-of-control Sara Lee truck. After I woke up in the afternoon, I got the pics developed from the cameras that I passed out at the party. They turned out ultra hilarious. I said my see-ya-laters to Woog and Nick at the family thing tonight and they were both good. Nick and I haven’t lived in the same town except for one semester since high school, so we’re well-versed in a telephone/email relationship.  Oh, he did give me a poster that Jennilin made that didn’t make the party cut. It had a recipe for chick pea and feta salad on it!! Very cute. Well I’m about to sleep my last night in my big bed here at the rents’ place. I’m waking up in a little over four hours to start the westward drive. It’s gonna be a cramped one.

      Monday finally arrived. Time for the movers to come in, shake a little bit (but not the fragile boxes) and load all my possessions save a few clothes (okay, AND my CDs and DVDs (what? So I’m anal about my stuff)) into their van and head on out to L.A.   10:00 a.m.: estimated arrival of movers.  12:30 p.m.: still no movers.  Hmmm. Well isn’t this a pickle....FOR ME. After staying on and off the phone with them until after 5:00 p.m., they decided they would come Thursday morning between 9 and 10 a.m....at their leisure, of course. Here’s the deal: our original pick-up date was Wednesday, July 14. Well, they wanted to come early so we busted our arses and got everything ready by Monday, the date THEY chose. Now they’re coming a day AFTER the originally scheduled date. Panicked? At this point...a little, yes. I’m figuring if they’re already this lackadaisical about my stuff, how are they going to be when they’re MOVING it? Send up prayers and good energy, I need it.  My mom sensed (and by sensed I mean witnessed outright) my stressed-outedness and suggested we go down to the beach for a few hours, where the remainder of our family was spending our annual week-at-the-condo. We went and hung out with everyone down there for a bit and went out to dinner. Woogie and I had some good laughs. He told me about riding through the beach with one of his friends harassing the pedestrians. Only they were shouting positive messages like, “Stay in school!!!” and “What a beautiful family!” Clever kids, these two.  I’d planned to spend Monday night with Nick since time was dwindling down and we hadn’t seen each other in over a week (rarity). He came over and we talked and laughed quite a bit. He told me about his weekend in Atlanta with Arie and the gang (Happy Late 22nd, Arie!!!). Apparently Arie still puts on a good show...miss that kid.  We finally decided to run to the Jiffy store for one of our “reality bites” moments. Too bad they weren’t playing “my sharona” tonight. After that, Nick suggested one last late-night pilgrimage to small-town holyville: Wal-Mart. Plus, we had to walk off the crap food we’d just eaten from the jiff. We kept quoting Whitney Houston from that old Diane Sawyer interview where she was asked if she did crack: “If I did crack, where da receipts? Where da receipts? Where...are...the receipts?” It’s really applicable to any conversation.  Similarly, and we can’t remember how this came about, but we’ve started saying, “So did you just want to write me a check?” Again, applicable in any sitch. The movers were giving my mother hell about how much it was going to cost (they upped it 11 cents per pound). They said something along the lines of, “If we give it to you at that [the cheaper] price, we’d be paying YOU to move.” To which my mother replied, “So if you’re paying ME to move, did you just want to write me a check?”   Actually, I wish I’d remembered either of those phrases at church on Sunday morning. This old woman at my church-- I’ll go ahead and say, I’m not her biggest fan to begin with– well, pissed me off to say the least. I walked by her pew on the way to the choir and she says, “Are you still going to California?”  Me - “Yes ma’am.” Her- “Well, you’re not going to be happy.” My thought: “You bitter old bitch.” My actual words (the most brutal thing I thought I could get away with in the House): “That is so ugly.” Better words: “So did you just want to write me a check?”

      countdown: 39 hours until the nuptials. I’ve been running all over this town from basket-purchasing to reception-favor-making to tux fittings to garter acquisitions to manicures. MOH: it ain’t just a title. One of my oldest girlfriends bonny is marrying a dry-witted, entertaining guy named mike on Saturday. It’s going to be pretty awesome.  She has great taste, which is totally in my favor since I have to don the dress of her choice. All eight of us, yes eight, a true huge southern wedding, will be wearing apple-colored strapless floor-length gowns. Between making hershey-kiss roses and red hot-baskets for the guests, we’ve had little time to discuss anything OTHER than the wedding. Bonny’s made me proud: she hasn’t freaked out yet...not too much at least.  In other news which is a little more pressing for me personally, the movers have taken it upon themselves to request that we’re ready two days earlier than scheduled. Panicked? Nah. My mother? Of course. She’s not really good at accepting my procrastination. My bedroom here at my parents’ house is still a total trainwreck and I have possessions in all rooms of the house, waiting to be packed or discarded at my discretion.  I think the hardest decision will be: which lunchboxes should I bring? (Sidebar: I collect metal lunchboxes and have a zillion. I’ve decided to bring two only. Rosie Riveter is a no-brainer, but I can’t decide between Grateful Dead or Candy Land.)  So basically hours have been split between packing, looking at things I need to pack, thinking about packing, and checking up on the bride to make sure we’re on track. Relatives have started to trickle into town. Grandma Clara drove down from iowa...and she’s not even either of their grandmothers! She’s one of the best men’s Grandma. She must really love Michael (the groom). Bon’s family from Virginia got in tonight and we all had dinner together.  Sunday night Mom and I had packed so much that I was sick of bubble wrap so I suggested we catch a movie. We went to the drive-in and saw “Dodgeball.” The conversation I had with this genteel southern woman far surpassed the film in hilarity. Granted I like a good Stiller/Wilson flick, it was too predictable and not enough Vince Vaughany. Typical crappy Hollywood ending, too. So rather than recap the movie, I’ll dwell on the lady-talk I experienced beforehand.  My mom was talking to a woman she knew (who I didn’t). This woman couldn’t have been more than 30, but she looked tired and ragged, the result no doubt of mothering three. Mom mentioned that she wouldn’t be at church for a while because she was helping me move to Los Angeles.  “Ooooooh girl!!! Whatchoo wawna go there for? There’s some FREAKS out there, girl,” the woman chirped.  I did my patented Jesup side-head-tilt-sweet-grin-say-nothing combo, created mostly for situations such as these. (It’s really an awkward-reducing mechanism...comes in handy). She proceeded to advise me against leaving (as most Jesup-folk do) and instead, suggested an alternative.   “Girrrrrl, you ain’t gone find no good Southern man out there, I can tell ya that. Mmm-MMM you ain’t gone find one. Lemme tell ya what I did. I made me a list. A list of thirteen things I wanted me in a man, and I prayed for it. I’s sixteen years old. And you know what? It took Him four years, but God sent me that man. Yes he did. And he’s got all thirteen’a them things. Butchoo know what? When you start prayin’, lemme tell ya - this is somethin I DID not do: pray for them in-laws, girl. Pray for you some good, southern in-laws. I got me some yankee ones girl, and it ain’t purdy. You just go head and start prayin’ now.”  I continued the head-smile combo throughout her speech.  She really was a sweet woman with good intentions. After the movie, mom and I got home and I said, “All right, Mama, we’ve got our work cut out for us.”  She looked at me questioningly. I motioned toward some of the packed boxes in the living room and said, “Well, we better start now if I’m gonna get all this stuff unpacked tonight. I mean, I need to go ahead and start on that list.” She just laughed. We joke about it every day. She’ll walk by my room and I’ll be writing something down and she’ll say, “Baby, what number are you on?” or “Don’t forget the Southern in-laws.”  I’m sure my mom secretly hoped deep down that she had a made-for-small-town-livin’ daughter, but she knows otherwise, and she’s amazingly supportive.

       urlLink   "SNECKS!"... "SHAHK!"  Really sir? You think I’m going to willingly hand over my money to you while you consistently yell that snakes and sharks await to sabotage me while simultaneously holding a spear and pointing it at me?  "I LOVE WHITE PEOPLE!!!"  Oh-ho, now you’re talking. Here’s two bucks.  So yes, I went to Venice Beach for the first time today. What a day. We literally spent hours walking in and out of all the little coves with redundant merchandise and rising prices. Wow, that’s too cynical even for me. Well, that was kind of my mood. I loved it immensely, don’t get me wrong – the bikers, the muscles, the angst-ridden starving artists. All great. All entertaining.   I made my way with Vicki (John’s best friend in town for a few days), her daughter Jessie and Jessie’s best friend Sterling through the chaos that is Venice. The first part of the trip was the most wrenching, I think. Jessie, 16, had never before seen the ocean. I couldn’t wait to see her reaction.  The closer we got I could tell she was trying to hold herself back. When our feet started the climb through the sand to the water she upped the pace a little bit. She had this irremovable grin that just seemed like a normal part of her face. She rolled up her jeans and she and Sterling frolicked in the water for what seemed like two hours. Vicki and I took lots of pictures.  Cliche and corny as it sounds, it was really amazing watching someone experience the ocean for the first time. Having lived about 45 miles away from it my entire life, I realized how much I took it for granted. I also take my personal space for granted and believe me, I didn’t have much of that in Venice Beach.  Everyone apparently goes on Saturday. At the first little store we came to, I vowed to purchase sunglasses. Who lives in California without owning a pair? Not me, after today. After I learned that every price is negotiable, I hunkered up a deal with the guy for a tooferwon special for Vicki and me since she had been so gracious as to treat me to dinner previously. We met the girls down a few stores trying on movie-star-esque glasses and took their picture; then I suggested that Vicki and I have a picture with our practical sunglasses.  Artist after artist after guitar player after weird-funky-bass player brought us to this man who just touched my heart. He was doing what he called "word art" so of course I’m stopping. He called himself U (pronounced Oo), had thick dreads, a killer smile, and a blunt in the tip of his fingers. The piece that caught my eye, it turns out, had been damaged so I bought it at a steal. I couldn’t resist.  Resisting didn’t seem to be a huge theme of the day, either. This dirty little dreaded-up white boy with his guitar approached us for a proposed serenade. The girls couldn’t resist. (Let me just clarify here, by "dirty little dreaded-up white boy" I mean hot guy...see? With the resisting?) When the troubador started strumming his chords, I said to myself, "Green Day? Really?" Sure enough, another turning point, a fork stuck in the road came spewing out. The girls went doey-eyed and melted a little. I chimed in and sang harmony. I think he got pissed. But, Sterling gave him a dollar. She just...couldn’t...resist.  At the end of the day when we traversed the entirety of the strip, John rejoined us from his spot on the beach and we made our way back toward the valley. The trip home was twice as fast, half as loud, and did NOT include the sighting of a really large black woman’s entire ass hanging out of her pants before she realized there was a draft and pulled them up. Seriously, on the way there we saw a woman’s WHOLE ASS. She hadn’t a clue.  So back in the valley we headed out for some Mexican cuisine and I decided to go for a margarita. I was so silly by the end of the meal; it was great. We headed off to Coco’s afterward for celebratory pie (celebrating...life I guess?) And played this game where everyone created a scenario then we went around and gave our answers. For example: the best prank you’ve ever pulled.  When we got back to the house I was exhausted and still floopy from the ‘rita, but the girls wanted to see pictures of my friends. We went through all my albums and I answered questions like, "What was he DOING?" or "where were you going dressed like THAT" and met with comments like, "Oh, he’s hot" and "Aww, you guys are so fun." Yeah, I loved it. I was definitely in my element. A domestic ending to a foreign day. Those are always appreciated.    urlLink     Good words - my U original  urlLink

      Friday, August 13, 2004: the day I officially become an employed adult. Well, I’m employed - we know that much. It’s been a hectic week, filled mostly with sitting by the phone and willing it to ring.  I had my second interview with a prospective employer on Tuesday. After my first interview, they called back and wanted me to meet with more people, including the VP of the department for which I was interviewing. I arrived on time without getting lost this time, and went to a little office to interview with two "peers." These guys had only been working there a matter of months. They couldn’t have been much older than me. They were both fun, had good senses of humor, and we seemed to get along.  Afterwards, the VP came in. I’ll admit, I was a little nervous. He didn’t make it any better by saying, with a perfectly-muddled French-L.A. accent, "Ok, tell me about you, why we want you? Hmm?"  Rrrrright. So I just started spouting things off. It’s what I do.  He told me after a lengthy interview that I would know something by the end of the week. My phone rang that night. It was them. They were interested in "moving forward with me" and would be calling to check my references. I would know tomorrow. This was Tuesday.  Wednesday came around, no phone call. Thursday came, no call. Crap! Had they decided against me after all? Did they find out I was some kind of secret web spy for MySimon or something?  So I did what any girl would do to ease the stress of not being called - I went to the movies. I saw  Napoleon Dynamite . Oh it made me laugh. Thought it was good.  So finally, I get a call from my Dad around 6:30 and he leaves a message. I then get three messages back to back, which was weird. When I call to check them, it turns out that the company HAD called – at 2 pm while I was at the movies. I called back, but of course, they were gone for the day. Good job, voicemail. Knew I could count on you.  So I had dinner with John and the girls and tried to keep my mind off the job. This morning, I awoke to a ringing phone - my mother. She called twice before I was even awake for the day, asking, "Have you heard from them? Have they called? Do you have news?" No mom, it’s still early here.  Finally, the phone call came. The job offer spilled out and the acceptance ensued. So, starting Tuesday, I will act as Merchant Operations Specialist for Bizrate.com. How stoked am I?! I made all the appropriate post-news calls: to Mom, Dad, and Nick. Meme called to congratulate and informed me that SOMEONE was coming to visit me next month, though the guest list is still tentative.  On to other east coast news - there’s a storm a-brewin’ and it’s not looking too pretty for my J-town loves. So far, they’ve only gotten rain but Bonnie and Charley are whippin’ it up and Nick expects some tornado warnings pretty soon. Run for cover, all you mobile home dwellers!

      I had the alarm set for 9:00 a.m. It went off, but I didn’t get up. I was planning on going to church today, but slept instead. I finally awoke to find a squatter in the yard. For at least four hours now a man has been sprawled out in his big red van, doors open, in our front yard. Puzzler. At first I thought he was a sunbather, but as soon as John got home he hopped up out of the grass and back into his van, fully clothed.  Perhaps he’s a P.I. or paparazzi. Then again, who would he want to snap in this neighborhood? The lady who appears sporadically on "Six Feet Under?" Never can tell. UnLESS he's just camped out sleeping off a bad drunkfest. Hmm...since I saw him puke his guts out on the street, I'm going to put my money on the latter. Thankfully, he's gone now...but not too far. His driver pulled him into the driveway across the street and began hauling sawhorses out of the back of the van.  Ralph just stay put - still sprawled out in the backseat.  So yesterday I had my first Arclight experience. Saw  Garden State . Hearted it pretty hard. The soundtrack was amazing. Nice to see The Shins finally getting a little recognition. Also, a trailer grabbed my attention immediately by playing "The Blower’s Daughter" by one of my favorite artists, Damien Rice. The movie was called  Closer  and stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Jude Law. Looks pretty sweet.  While we didn’t see any A-list stars, I did spot a pretty familiar face as we left the theatre and walked over to Amoeba. I kept passing the guy and by the third time I was like, ok is that the kid from The Mighty Ducks? I checked ol’ reliable imdb when I got home, and sure enough, I’d had a brush with THE Elden Henson.  Speaking of close encounters, I’ve talked to my friend Josh in Baghdad for the past few days and things are just plain shitty over there. First the whole city went up in gunfight and two of his buddies got shot. He called me the night that happened and said he just felt like he was in the middle of a dream and just couldn’t wake up. Then today he almost got killed in an ambush. I’m so ready for this stupid war to be over. On the bright side, he gets leave in a few days so will get to spend two weeks with his family. But then he has to go right back to hell for seven or eight more months. As if it isn’t already blatantly obvious: I hate war.

      I sit down at the computer to check the status of my bank account, which has been showing unnecessary service charges for the past few days to an offline message from my friend Josh who’s in Baghdad: "Hey Mandy, we got in a gunfight tonight and two of my friends got shot right in front of me." I’ve already been freaking out about his situation. This just hit me way too hard. I called Kayvon to talk about it but he was out with a friend. He insisted we talk anyway, but I felt bad for interrupting his night.  So here I sit, not unlike most other days, being pissed off at war. On another subject, not completely unrelated to war: I got lost in Downtown L.A. today. You’d think I could follow directions, right? Wrong. I ended up about 15 miles away from my interview destination. I called the place so they could help me reorient myself and the woman said, "We’re not even IN downtown." Ha!  But at least she had awesome direction sense and had me at the interview at only twenty minutes past the originally scheduled time. As for the interview itself, it has now surpassed yesterday’s interview as my current favorite fantasy job. I’ll know tomorrow whether either will become reality.  While I was taking a logical thinking test at the interview, my cell phone rang. How perfect. I’d forgotten to switch it off. Luckily, I was alone in the testing room so I didn’t see any looks of disdain. The call was from an interview I’d had earlier in the week: they wanted a second interview with the owner. Normally, I’d be really crunk about such an offer, but I’d already seen such better jobs since this day that I just felt blah about it. Of course I won’t say no to anything right now, but still...this job is shit pay for twice the work and unpaid overtime. When I agreed to come in tomorrow for follow-up with the owner, the guy on the phone said, "Great! See you at 11:30 in the morning. Just don’t wear any perfumes, scented oils, or fragrances." I’m just going to go ahead and guess that Mr. Business Owner either has allergies or has ALLERGIES.  So, after all the test-taking, then interviews with three different people in the company, I felt great. I really got along with all the people. I could already see more advantages of this job over the administrative assistant one. Again, the hopes are high. Friday holds the answer. I made my way across town to my 3:00 p.m. interview. For some reason I had a bad feeling about it, and I didn’t even want to go. I convinced myself that I was just overly excited about the previous interview and that I should go check it out. After all, that’s the only decent thing to do. I walked into the office and met with Elaine. She immediately asked about my being a writer and said, "Honestly, Mandy, that doesn’t appeal to me at all." When she asked if I was looking for something permanent, though I answered ‘yes,’ she was skeptical. She equated writer with flaky and flighty, so she sent me on my way.  Apparently some intuitions are right. But hey, all I’d lost were two hours and fifty cents for parking. On the bright side, I got a pretty good tour of West L.A., so it was a good day.

      Another day has come and gone with no unpacking to claim. But I had a pretty productive day otherwise, so I won’t kick myself too hard for the box-neglect. I woke up bright and early, cooked breakfast (Christened the stove at the new abode) and got ready for yet another interview. Honestly, it had to be better than the previous ones which involved the following: one at a loud machine shop with dingy old files and a man who asked yes-or-no questions then quickly ushered me out; one at a staffing agency, which seems promising IF nothing else delivers; and one with way too many hours and responsibilities to pay ten bucks an hour.  So here I stood in the bathroom, straightening my out-of-control hair and wondering what lay ahead. I drove over to Culver City for the interview, and only took one wrong turn so I was proud of myself. I pulled into the company lot in which I was instructed to park and immediately got stalked by this big van complete with two men honking and disapprovingly shaking their heads. What? I was told to park here. I enter the foyer, call the extension of my interviewer, and indeed I parked in the only space that I shouldn’t have. So after I met a fun chef named Archie who assisted me with parking, I went into the big guy’s office for the interview.  He did about a ten-minute pitch of the company, which specializes in catering and event planning for large corporations and individuals, then asked me what I thought. I already wanted to work for the man. He asked me a couple really vague, open-ended questions so I of course gave him an ear-full. I made him laugh, so I think that’s a plus. Also, he liked the fact that I trekked over from Georgia, so hopefully that’s in my corner as well. I just got really excited about the whole thing and my hopes are already sky-high, but there’s no other way to live. I mean, who wants to be blasé about something when you can get crunk?  So I was led around the building and introduced to a lot of the staff and I got to see how some things worked. Just more fuel for my hopes. Interviews ran today and will run tomorrow and I’ll know Friday afternoon if I’m the one for the job. I, of course, think I am, but we’ll see if Mark agrees.  Yesterday in preparation for today, I did a dry-run over to Culver City seeing as how I hadn’t driven on the freeway yet; actually I hadn’t driven at ALL for about three weeks so I was anxious to get back behind the wheel. It was fun. Not too scary; nothing like I expected. So after the trip over, my parents were preparing to grab a cab over to LAX to spend the night before they departed this morning back to Home, Sweet Home. We had a good visit and I’m so grateful that they came with me. We had so much fun, and they and John really hit it off so we had fun doing family things together. John said he actually missed them when they left.  The cab arrived and whisked them away. I ran to the grocery store, stocked up the fridge, and began unpacking dishes. Dear Lord, bubble wrap takes forever to remove. Needless to say, I unpacked about seven dishes. Afterwards, John wanted to go to dinner, so we went over to Ralph’s and laughed until I almost squirted water out of my nose. Laughter is so therapeutic. That wasn’t the end of the laughter for the night by any means. We returned to the house and I decided to check up on some laundry I had going. I noticed that the guest towels I’d folded to return to John were disheveled atop the dryer, so I picked up the top one to refold and...well...about 15 cylindrical brown objects rolled out onto the washer and dryer. I had no reaction. I mean, I knew it smelled bad in the laundry room, but I didn’t know why, until I attempted to fix the towels.  I went to John: "Hey John, umm you might want to take a look at this." John: "Uh oh, did somebody poop?"  We went back to the scene of the special delivery and just cracked up laughing. I just wish he’d seen my face when I saw what I saw. We laughed through the clean-up process, rewashed the towels and John said, "Welcome to my dysfunctional home."  Apparently his cat Jake is a bit of an activist. John said he did it in protest to the bathroom door being shut (where he usually sends those kind of packages). So that was just...weird, but hilarious.  Well, the ‘rents landed in Jacksonville and drove back home to Jesup a-ok. I was very thankful for such a good trip for them. They deserved it. Only, when they got to J-town, picked up the babies and got home, it was hot as hell. Apparently the AC had ceased to function sometime while they were gone. Mom said the house was like 92 degrees. Geez. By the time I talked to them, J.T. was already asleep and Mallory was fading fast in front of a "Who’s The Boss?" marathon. I’ll talk to her tomorrow hopefully. I think that’s been the hardest thing for me so far - not being able to be with her. She goes tomorrow to meet her second grade teacher, so she’s excited about that. She promised a full report.  That girl...she is the most amazing creature I’ve ever experienced. I remember this one night when she was sleeping over, when I’d moved back in with my parents before coming to L.A. and she says, "Hey Dee Dee, let’s do a show." So, I flipped on the computer, let her pick the songs, and we performed a song and dance concert in her playroom. She came up with this really fierce spin-and-fall combo move for "All That Jazz." She’s so creative. I’m going to miss watching her grow up right in front of me, but she has big things in her immediate future. Her parents are building a house on my parents’ land right next door, so she’ll be lots closer to Sissy and Joe. And J.T. is staying with Mom this year instead of a sitter, so that’s going to be amazing for him. He already told Daddy on the phone the other day, "I’m ready to come to your house and ride MY tractor and MY truck and to go MY shop." Everything’s his. Including his larger-than-life voice that he uses to talk to me on the phone. I can’t imagine how such a huge bellow can come out of such a small little boy. So yes, redundantly I will state: I miss my babies. If I told J.T. that, he would say, "Keep cool, my babies!" in perfect Conan-mimicry.  Now I’m preparing for two more interviews tomorrow in West Los Angeles. Hopefully one of these will produce a job. If not, I’m back to whoring out my resume on Craig’s List for another however-many-days-it-takes.  Oh! Happy Birthday to Brian, my friend Em’s fiancé!!! Hope it was a fierce one! Can't wait to see you guys!!
