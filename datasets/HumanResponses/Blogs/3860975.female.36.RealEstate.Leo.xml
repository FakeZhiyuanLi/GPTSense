         Yesterday afternoon (that's Thursday, Philippine time) I accompanied my raw sister-in-law (hipag na hilaw) or sister-in-law to-be, Angel, to the dentist, also named Angel (what a coincidence!). The dental clinic is a cubicle beside the beauty parlor where patients get to pass by before reaching the clinic.    Anyway, it was so drowsing afternoon, so boring I got back to my crossword puzzle double digest. There were no people in the parlor except for one. They went out for lunch.    When they arrived, relaxed, chit-chat for some time, this very slim fag who is the one in-charge of all beauty whatevers told me: "Halika dito, upo ka dito, aayusin ko kilay mo. Sige na, para gumanda ka pa."  (Come over here, sit down here, I'll fix your brows. Come on, so you will look more beautiful) .    I hesitated for some time because I'm not used to "editing" whatever's given me. I'm a simple person and an active one that I just spend a minute in front of the mirror just to brush my hair and that's it. But the adventurous in me overpowered...besides I wanted something that will awaken my sleepy brains...so I gave in.    After, I noticed the difference...and at last I got brows! Rather, my brows show now instead of merging with my eyes! :D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no regrets!    Then I asked him to trim my hair also since that's what I wanted to have done anyway. Now I got the reason to pursue it. So I look like more of a person now! :D :D :D

      I was in a meeting with The Core Seven. That's the core group of the Talitha Cumi Outreach Foundation, Inc. where I belong. Among other things we've talked about (activities, projects, plans), we  were able to formulate and give meaning to TALITHA and THE CORE SEVEN. Here goes:      T rustworthy   A miable   L oving   I nnovative   T houghtful   H onest   A dventurous     -and-      T rustworthiness   H umor   E xcitement     C harity   O neness   R esourcefulness   E agerness     S acrifice   E xcellence   V alue   E nergy   N obility     It's always been a pleasure to meet with them. Knowing that what we're doing does good for somebody else especially those who are needy.    I've also taken pictures for our website...it would be nice if people can see real people behind the Foundation, wouldn't it?    Till next...

        I got an idea. And this post is an example. I've taken a pic of myself a few minutes ago and that's what you see now. I just thought that it would be better if one could imagine how the poster looks like at the moment of posting. What do you think?    Now back to the regular posting...    I couldn't continue yet from where I left off...the latest poem...next time...    I just was able to recover from the loss of sleep though I still feel I need more...    I'm currently eating my dinner...and it's 12:09 am of July 10. Why am I saying this? Coz the time reflected here is not my time. What am I eating? Spanish sardines! ...with hot chili Philippine Labuyo! Wow! I think I eat less without it. And it's anti-carcinogen so it's good for the health!    Am also currently sipping some gin with  my hubby...well...I'm a bit tipsy....

      It's almost two and twenty hours ago,  When up from bed to my Mac I went;  'Twas at three a.m., so that you know,  When I started my day and it's almost spent.    It's not my habit actually,  To get up at three, tha'ts too early;  It was just so hot, I couldn't breathe,  Asthma attack is what I have to bear with.    So I got to the kitchen breathlessly,  Heated some water for my coffee;  It's the first aid I know that works perfectly,  For an asthmatic just like me.    By a quarter to six a.m. my hubby got up,  Getting ready for work, with a towel he's wrapped;  After handing me his shirt to the shower he went,  And when he comes out he'll look for the shirt.    Now I'm sleepy I almost fell on my Mac,  Was just awaked coz it's the bed I lack;  To the room I will go after shutting this down  Next blog will continue what I've started so don't frown.    Bloggingly yours....

      Let me see...  Now I have a blog spot...  What am I gonna do with it?  Hmmm...how about writing something about my friend...on the spot...    WYNESS    W hen did I start to know about you, I wonder,   Y our look was so young then according to your picture;   N ever disconnected from the net, it seemed,   E verytime I log in, he's already logged in!   S o time went by, I got off for awhile,   S igning back after some years, he got a new smile!    Ha! It may not be so good but it's written live! I mean, on this very time I was thinking  of it.   : ) Till next...

      First of all, I'd like to thank somebody who gave me the idea of creating my own blog. Thanks, Wyness! (He's a friend from across the globe!)    I wonder what I would be posting. As if I have all the time in the world! :)    Anyway, it's a start...    You'd better read my mind rather than hear me speak. I'm not a good speaker...am a better listener...and a good writer perhaps! At least, better than my speaking.    Maybe I can post some of my poems written decades ago (I'm revealing my age!)...    Oh, I don't know yet, really...     Again, Hello World!      And thanks, Wyness!
