       Welcome to my blog!   So this is something new to try... I've never heard of blogs, but my pal Laurie has one, and it looked kinda neat. So here I am.  Well, I guess there's not better place to start than today! So far, I've woke up very groggy, came to work... and that's all. I actually got a front row parking space, which never happens. So something must be going right.   Today should be a pretty easy day. Especially as far as classes go. I've only got chamber winds and band. Wee! So yeah, it shall be fun.   I'm getting all geared up for my senior recital. Maybe I'm a little too excited about it, since it isn't until March? I've already heard some negative comments from people and from behind my back about what I'm doing. But, you know what? This recital isn't for them. It's for me! It's the payoff of over 10 years of practice and dedication to my art. It's for everyone and everything that has helped or influenced me along the way... so if they think it's dumb to play six instruments and spin flags... they can stay at home and watch TV. *tosses hair*  I FINALLY heard back from Ratcliff at Alma. He really liked my piece! He is supposed to let me know closer to May if they will be able to perform it. It would be my own world premiere! Exciting eh? I think so.  I dunno much else I guess. I'm not looking forward to band... we are doing another cheesy patriotic big american flag song to "break up the monotony of the show". Can't wait (sarcasm). I just hope those dang clarinets memorize their music for once. I can't say much b/c I'm not the section leader. But, I can give mean faces and look pissy better than anyone I know!   I maybe going to J'boro this weekend to visit someone special. :)  I really hope I get to. We will see...   Well I hope I did an okay job on my first BLOG! I guess that is it for now... time to go back to passing out headphones... haha.   P.S. Sarah Mclachlan new CD out TODAY!!!  urlLink

      Ahh Spring!  It's the end of spring break :(  Oh well. I had fun. It was good to get away from here for a bit... I was becoming static. I left last Friday for Fort and had my usual Chili's date with Court. We have too much fun! I love it. I had an electric lemonade yuuuum yum. Then we watched some lame reality contest "Playing it Straight" or whatever. Her dog Ellie loves me so much! Who can blame her?  Saturday I went out to eat with my sis. Court and I hung out again too, just drivin around the big city. It was a nice relaxing day. (But gloomy) Then Sunday I went out to the grandparents house in Lavaca. It was such an awesome day. The weather was perfecto. I love spring so much.. I just can't explain how it makes me feel.   Monday I woke up at 6a and left for Dallas with Seth, Rachel, and Court. It was a fun trip! The weather was weird, but never got it was alright. We saw the big buildings and whatnot.. every town in Texas has Chili's and Target. WHATS UP WITH THAT!? I love it. Plus I saw two roads named after me and tons of those "Ross Dress for Less" stores. I think it wa a sign I need to move. ANYWAY, the rides at six flags are scary and I didnt ride much. It was fun anyway. We got back a little after midnight.. LOOONG day.  Tuesday I got my hair chopped off again! It had been since Nov. Crazy... Then Wednesday I went to Tulsa w/the parents. We went to the biiiig aquarium thingy in Jenks.. it was so cool. Around Thursday I was ready to pack up and come back to RussVegas though. And now its Friday. No plans, but I'm not that worried about it. Just gonna soak up the rest of the break.   Silence and quiet again in my life. Ciao for now.

      Well, it's March. Oops. I guess I should update on the past three or four months, huh?   Marching season is over, it was a bust. I loved the drill, but the music was annoying after a few performances. It was my last time to march with the ATU band. I've come so far since that first show. I never thought I could do it. I know one thing is for sure, UCA, HSU, UofA, and ASU never come close to accomplishing what we do. No one marches like us, no one sounds like us.. and they never will. Our colorguard was an embarassment this year, but thats because it is turning into 13th grade spinning for Russellville High School. Maybe it will turn around again some day. I can't decide if I'm happy or sad about it being over. I have a ton of memories from each season. And put it a ton of time and effort. For all that work the ending was pretty plain and dull. OH well.   Senior recital has been postponed until April 7th, which is a good thing. The ensemble is going to be like nothing anyone has done here. We've had so much fun practicing it, and I still get goosebumps when I hear anyone play something I've written. It's like a part of me comes alive. Something I dug out of my soul gets to be heard! It's very exciting. Plus there are alot of laughs with it too.  Well, I didn't go to Jboro that weekend in November. But something told me to just go for it on the 22nd. I had a pep band game that night and it wasn't over until about 9 or something. I thought about going the whole time I was there, then called Court and she talked me into it! I went with no clue what I was doing.. just followed the road ahead of me in the night. I knew at least it would be a good road trip. I've never been to NEA. I talked to Renee' most of the way there b/c I had no clue where I was going and she is from Paragould. I wasn't even really nervous. Well, things were unbelieveable. I never knew I could feel so ... I don't know. It's an odd situation from the get-go. But I had an amazing time. I didn't sleep at all.. but stayed the night there. Then had to be back to work in the lab the next day. That next weekend I had a visit from J and it was even more amazing! Went to Mt. Nebo that night and it was breathtaking. We both cried. I was in love, and was loved back. Never in my life have I ever felt so special. The next day I skipped all of my classes and just spent time here holding hands and all that garbage. The next weekend I was off to Jboro for Three days this time instead of two. I tried to find my way to the house on my own, but didnt work.. got just a little lost. It was getting close to Xmas, so the tree was up and all. I had just finished the Xmas parade and gotten on the road, another late night trip. I met the friends, I was so nervous! We all went to IHOP when I arrived b/c I was starving. The friends were odd.. but funny. They all smoke.. and talk trash. But hey.. whatever! J paid for my meal, it was sweet. Then we went back and chatted some, the friends left and it was us. I can't forget those moments. The next day we stayed in bed forever. The dog came in and peed all over the sheets! I thought it was funny, J did not. We drove around town and ran errands. Ate at Perkins! It was cold and yucky out, but I didn't care for the first time. Normally I HATE cold weather. But, I was kept warm and safe. That night was odd.. smokey friends came over and played xbox and watched weird movies. The smoke was horrible.. I had to go outside at one point.. it was freezing. I called Court and spoke with her some. We watched this horrible movie w/the friends/roomies and held hands. Just the two of us went out to get the movie. I cried b/c I knew I had to leave the next day. So J took me to TCBY and bought me a cappucino thingy. I took benadryl that night so I could sleep better. J left on some really trippy pretty music in the cd player while we slept. It was like I was on another planet.. trippy music + benadryl + love. The next morning was so hard. I left early. J had to work. J led me to the intersection and then looked, waved, and turned off to get breakfast before work. That was the last time we'd see each other.  The next weekend it snowed so there was no way I would let J drive three hours with no phone. Then it was graduation. Renee` and Matt graduated. It was exciting. Kim called me and woke me up.. I was late. I ran across campus in the snow, in my tux, w/my clarinet.  Renee's fam had a get-together afterwards with fam and friends. It was fun. St. Nick's punch! YUM! Then it was time to go home for Xmas break.  Xmas break sucked. I worked.. new manager, it was weird. All I thought about was J. We talked more than once everyday I was in FS. Said the most amazing things. We were both excited about New Years Eve. Finally a long time to spend together. I asked off for the last two weeks of my break. Well Xmas eve was the last time I talked to J. I was told I hear from him on the following Friday when Xmas fam stuff was over. On Xmas day (night) I went outside and looked at the moon, thinking.. wow someone is thinking about me right now. And loving me. Everyone could tell there was something different inside of me. No one knew. No one knows!   A week later, nothing.. two weeks later, nothing.. a month later, nothing. I had my heart ripped out of my chest. Those weeks were hell. What did I do? Why? It was all I could do to just sleep. I became dependent on benadryl, which I didnt think was possible. I finally got to the point where I had to at least go to jboro and get an answer. I drove three hours, crying the whole time.. after driving to FS and back (to rsvl). I talked to Court and Renee much of the time I was driving.  When I finally got there, there was no one home. It was awful. I even went to the store.. no sign. So I went back to the house, left the Xmas card (with the hastings gift card) and the cuff and left. I tried calling a few times before I left.. but I knew from the past weeks I wouldn't get an answer. I drove around town, crying and lost. Got gas at a station we stopped at.. and followed his written directions back out of town. The roads were lonely before, but there is no way for me to describe what they were like that night. It was endless black. I could see the stars though.. thats what I concentrated on the whole way there.. guess I was trying to wish on them.. hah. My head was filled with everything I was promised, never being hurt.. always being loved.. what the hell happened? And all the songs from the CD he made.  I talked to Renee' the whole three hours back, and then some once I was home. She is one of the many guardian angels I'm lucky enough to have. I would have never made it home w/o her.  I cried for weeks.. I didnt eat for one. I even collapsed in the shower crying one day. It was hell. It seemed no one understood this pain. It was hell. My self-esteem has ALWAYS been low, and this was so amazing, someone LOVE ME?? Someone thought I was worthy of their time and energy? Someone kissed me?! And now this..  Well my girls were amazing.. Lona, Beth, Vickie, Court, Renee, Laurie, Kim, and Tiff.. they picked me up so many times. My friend Justin delt (and still deals) with my ramblings on and on. I know I've been a nutcase, a nuisance.. but no one has ever made me feel bad for it. So I tried to put everything back together.. I'd never given so much of my heart away. And I'll never get it all back.  I heard from J over a month later.. kind of weird.. VERY weird. Apologies.. unconfirmed reasonings.. being scared, running away.. still in love.. bla bla. My hopes got high.. and then it happened again. I called it off. I cut off all contact. And here I am.   I dunno if it was right or wrong. All I know is my heart can't stand the hurt. I still get upset every now and then. It helps that its warmer now. I feel better than I did. But, still not complete. I will always have J in my heart ALWAYS. No one has made me feel this way. I dont know.. I think its all done with. I came really close to emailing this week, but stopped myself. I'm not trying to play the victim, or get pity.. I'm trying to get it out of my head. I want it to go away. I want to "get over it" as I've been told to do over and over.   School sucks. I hate it. I don't want to be a teacher. I want to compose. I want to be independent. want want...   I think I've spilled enough crap for now!! Its been awhile what can I say? BBL!

      Saturday, July 31, 2004  well - i've never felt so unusual as i do right now ---  dci was amazing. i met lona and adam at gringos and had dinner, then we left for the stadium. i really didnt know what to expect b/c i'd never been to a dci event, only wgi. it was so awesome. even though they were only div. 2 and 3 corps, the sound was excellent and the guards were terrific! i saw stackhouse and matt marching with memphis sound. they looked like they were having a blast. i saw sooo many famliar faces from camp, region, community band, high school, and college. i was just amazed. i didnt get back to russvegas til after midnight. good times.  the rest of the week was as usual.. lee needed to go to jonesboro on saturday (today) to pick up his puppy from his ex and wanted to know if shane and i would go with him. i thought about it for a long time, and just said sure. well last night i told jason we would be in town and he ended up tellin me to call him when we got there and all that. so i called him when we got to harrisburg and he was shopping and told me to call when we figured out where we were going to eat. so i called him when we decided on o'charleys. i was honestly so messed up that i couldn't even think about eating. but i ordered a sammich b/c i knew i would get sicker if i didnt. also only have two hours of sleep didnt help anything. so i was waiting on him to call while we were eating when he walked in with skip and jon. it was so unreal. the last time i saw him was in december and everything was perfect. i didnt know that i would see him again until almost eight months later. he looked kinda different, but not much. it was just weird. he sat down and ordered then came over to our table finally - it seemed like 2450982245098 hours before he finally did. then we ended up at our own table... it was hard to look at him. he always looks so goofy.. his unsymmetrical dimple when he smiles. his puppy dog droopy eyes. not much had changed... except the fact that everything had changed. i was shaking and my eyes just darted around at pointless art deco on the walls. he hardly looked at me, but when he did he just kinda stared all weird. i kept saying "what?" and he'd say "nothing"... pointless mindless small talk and banter.. then his food arrived so he said he was going to go eat with his friends.. so lunch continued with lee and shane. lee kept insisting " you can do better " lol i guess thats a compliment. tiffany called while we were sitting there to see if i was in town... but yeah i couldnt finish anything. i just stared into space. i was too nervous to even leave b/c we would have to walk by their table. so i stopped and said bla bla bla.. i was so shakey, i just told them to be careful on their way to memphis and all that.. told him it was nice to see him again.. and then left. once i sat in the car i started tearing up and that was that. i cried for awhile.. lee really comforted me. made me feel alot better. so then we went to the mall and i bumped into buster! which totally cheered me up. we scoped out some hotties and then went back to pick up lee's puppy from petco. out of nowhere i saw crabby walking out of old navy! so shane stuck his head out the door and yelled at him. he was very surprised to see me! we talked forever and he cracked me uuuuup!!!! so seeing buster and crabs cheered me up alot... then we headed back. stopped in beebe to visit with tracy in his GORGEOUS house!! it was so beautiful. he's very nice. then it was back to rsvl. the day was sooo long and i'm so drained... how did seeing jason make me feel? i have no idea. its still buzzing around in my head. i still will never understand what he did and why he did it. my stomach felt like it had been ripped out on the way home though. lee really helped so much... i got a text on my way back home from jason saying he was glad he got to see me even though it was akward and not for very long.. something to that effect. anyway... all in all it was ok. i'm just glad i have such amazing friends to help me through this ---  hasta  it was a couple of years ago i was sitting beside my window and never will make the same mistake  cause thats when he walked on by almost a year i followed i dont regret a single a day  then he changed and proceeded to tear from me every inch of soul u see  and he's kept it to this day  and i die everytime i find a piece of him in corners of my mind so i washed it all away and time it took me time but i had left those memories back and far behind he called me yesterday just to say hey  i was the last to know such an infatuation that i can say with certainty  it took me a lifetime to forget u but i did i never want to see your face or speak your name  i die everytime i find a piece of him in corners of my mind so i washed it all away and time it took me time but i had left those memories back and far behind he called me yesterday just to say hey mandy moore - hey

      Wednesday, July 28, 2004  urlLink   Currently Playing  urlLink Ambulance LTD &nbsp; urlLink see related   well where did the week go? its been awhile! not that i've been busy.. just too lazy i guess. so lets see whats happened...  i bought a VCR! exciting i know! i finally took the plunge into 80's technology. i mean.. i had the DVD player.. but i have all these vhs tapes that i can never watch... but now i can. woohoo. also my mom taped i love the 90's for me, so i had to watch those. good times. it was really good, but they left out ALOT of stuff... i've heard they are going to have i love the 90's part deux though. so maybe that will make up for it. i also got a webcam.. why i have no idea! i used it about twice to wave at my friends... but it was 20 bucks and for some reason that meant i had to purchase it! and now i dunno what for. impulse buying dammit. i can give tours of my fun apt. though i guess. &nbsp;i spent some time with miss lona this week.. went to quizno's (of course) and washed my car. we watched blast too.. had a great time with her. i've known her longer than any of my friends! its nice.   of course we've had our nightly J trips. its been really fun. roger has joined us a couple of times. we also see some fellow music nerds out there from time to time. its nice to just sit around and laugh. laughing is always good!  we found out that our music is "the mask of zorro" this week for the fall show. it should be interesting. i'm very nervous about my first year spinning... hopefully it will all go well. i'm sure it will be rocky at times... marching is always difficult - but i love it.   vickie came to rsvl friday and we had quiznos and ran some errands for her. we had a good time.. it started stormin.. pretty cool storms over the weekend. saturday lee and i storm chased in dardanelle.. woohoo! he showed me where he grew up in ola. laurie visited on her way back from a wedding at subiaco. we watched big brother and amazing race. good times! i missed seeing her so much! she's an amazing friend. we barely see each other but somehow always stay in touch.   sunday vickie and jared had a cookout with me, trish, tate, delo, and jared's perryville friends. we had a great time. good food and such. they played horseshoes.. which i didnt really catch on to, but it was fun to watch. vickie got really sad when we all left. they are leaving for AZ wednesday and will probably be there for the next year or so. i'm sure we will stay in touch though.   i should be getting my 2004 winterguard dvd this week. WOOHOO! i've been waiting on it since april. its about time!  today shane, lee, and i headed to conway to shop. we went to target where i purchased some cd's and dvd's, then pier 1 and kohls. they had some awesome wall art at kohls but i decided i should stop buying things! then we ate at a really nice deli called mcalisters. we had such a good time. very fun trip.   tomorrow i'm headed to van buren to watch a drum corps competition "battle on the border" i'm very excited about that! lona will be going with me and i'll get to see mom, dad, richard, and pete. woohoo! matt and stackhouse will be marching with memphis sound too. it'll be awesome.  thats all i really know for now... life is simple, i suppose thats good. i have things on my mind though... the past - the future.. i'm very worried about fall. this should be interesting. fall has always been a nostalgic time - for me at least. theres something about the air, the wind getting colder, days getting darker. its odd. and especially dealing with everything that happened last fall... i'm not sure how i'll handle it. hopefully good. i'll let ya know.  hasta

      Well here it is, my first entry. I still have to read all of Ross's, it's a lot to read all at once! I had a good 4th of July. I got to spend some time with my Melissa, Kieran, and Bailey. Bailey is getting so chubby and she's such a good baby! She wakes up in a good mood and is laughing all the time, it's so cute. We had a BBQ at my aunt Clarissa's on Sunday and then went to the fireworks show downtown that night. This week has been going by so slow! I was suppose to get paid today but our checks didn't get here in time so I won't get it until tomorrow so that sucks! But a good thing is that I won $100 off of KISR today! I was the 20th caller and I had to tell them what was on a page in the red phone book. I won't get the money until Tuesday but it's still great!! Anyway, haven't much to say right now so I'm gonna get to reading the rest of Ross's blogs.

      *Okay -- so I took my xanga posts and added them.. that way I'm caught up both places! how exhausting! I just discovered I could finally get rid of that ugly template on here*   Wednesday, July 07, 2004    Currently Playing Mud on the Tires By Brad Paisley see related  - Whiskey Lullaby (ft. Alison Krauss) well summer 2 started today.. wee philosophy is so fun, i'm surprised we don't take it in grade school. BLAH. but englehoven is in there with me, i didn't see him til class was out.. but that was exciting! he's very nice. there were some other folks from my summer 1 classes in there too. i'm sure it will be thrilling.   last friday i decided to go spin during a break from the storms out in the marching lot. it was weird b/c it was sunny to the west and stormy to the east... kinda cool. anyway, i was spinnin and practicing some stuff and it started sprinkling and lightning. it was so cool! THEN a gigantic rainbow appeared! i'm not talkin a tiny one, it stretched all the way across. i just starred at it til it dissapeared. it was amazing.  went home over the fourth weekend, mom was in the hospital the whole time b/c of an ulcer she had developed. she lost alot of blood, but she is better and at home now. it was very odd being in the hospital again. especially seeing her laying there. me and granny got lost in the hallways, but we laughed so hard trying to find our way back to the room.   i saw my sis over the weekend too. we went to el lorito, yum yum! then i made her watch winterguard dvd's haha. i'm so evil. other than that i just sat around the house and made sure everything was okay there. then back to russvegas.  lee is single again and now wants to hang out again. i tell ya. its my life story. just sit on the backburner until someones bored again. lol its okay though. i'm not whining or anything. i'm glad i can be there.   i wont be seeing court much anymore since she's done with summer school.. that makes me sad! having ellie and lucy here was so fun. i'll get to see her plenty this weekend at the wedding though. i'm ready for this thing to be done with. bleh.   band camp started again yesterday! i just love the sounds of junior highers playing. haha. takes me back. anyway.. i guess thats all the news for now.   hasta  Tuesday, June 29, 2004    Currently Playing Satisfaction By Benny Benassi see related   Well June is almost over, and with it Summer 1! Woohoo! This has been such an unusual summer. I usually spend them at home in Ft Smith and workin at Wal-Mart... so it's my first summer from home. Haven't really done anything to exciting. School and work keeps me terribly busy. But this is the last week for workin in the music lab. Probably a dumb idea... but it will free up some time. Yay!  What's the deal with the weather? It's been hot, but not as hot as it should be. Maybe July will bring in some warmer weather. The sunsets of June have been amazing though. I don't think film would capture how awesome they've been. It's weird that I notice stuff like that. I always notice stuff most people don't. Stuff like that makes me so happy though. The clear nights of spring and summer just do somethin to me. I dunno... it's my romantic nature. I think everyone just thinks I'm nuts. Maybe they are right! Like me writing this stuff... who cares!?    I'm listening to the old LP's of ATU Summer Music Camps from the late 60's. They are pretty amazing. Alfred Reed came to the camps! I did not know that. They also had some guy twirlling instructor. It used to be a Music/Twirling camp. So TECH is to blame for promoting majorettes!! Grrr. If it was a guard camp it would be much better.    I'm sposed to go see Beth when I get off work, that will be cool. I haven't seen her much this summer... or Lona. And we live in the same town! But, they have work and men to deal with... as I have school and work.   Court is bringing Ellie and Lucy to stay for the day on Friday! YAY! I love havin Ellie here, so I can't wait to have Lucy too! I'm sure it will be a blast. We are gonna run and get lunch too.  Speakin of lunch, I missed having lunch with Vickie on Monday b/c I took a nap between classes.  I felt so bad. But I had three hours of sleep the night before thanks to someone. Ok, so it's sorta my fault too.  So I gotta run and visit her in Conway sometime soon. I still can't believe her and Jared are moving to AZ in July. It makes me really sad. But, thats all part of growin up. Movin on and going forward in life. Every year I grow up just a lil bit more. I cannot believe how much I've learned since being away from home. I've grown so much, and keep doing so. My 20's have been especially developmental. I just kinda careened through my teens. I thought life was crazy then. People never cease to amaze me... postively or negatively.   *sidebar* I just remembered I have to apply for stage 2.. CRAP!!  Oh yeah.. my sis got married, on the beach in Florida. I'm glad she's happy. I still haven't seen they guy since they've been married, but I rarely see him anyway. I hope he's good to her. She seems to think so... but we all know my feelings toward the male species that I'm a part of.  I'm sure it will be wonderful.  Rachel and Seth are getting married in like two weeks. Wee... crazy. I never saw it coming. I still find it kind of hard to believe. But, getting to spend all that time with Court will be awesome. We are going to the rehearsal dinner together of course and then walking down the aisle at the wedding together. Don't tell her, but I'm gonna trip her and cause a scene!!  And I believe I"m going to meet her beau John at the wedding too. That should be fun. Seems like they've really hit it off. While we are on the subject.. lets check in with my gal pals: Beth - dating Josh, Lona - dating Lance, Renee` - dating Neil, Court - dating John, Rachel - engaged to Seth, Vickie - married to Jared.   ARGH! hehe only kidding, I'm very happy for all of them. I just barely get to talk to any of them anymore. It doesnt make it any better that within the 6 pack there are issues too. Some like some, others don't. But, thats life!   I suppose I should stop rambling as I have been typing forever. Just had to catch myself up.   Cool summer tunes: The Thrills - Big Sur, Of Montreal - Disconnect the Dots, Chumbawamba - On eBay, Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out, Scissor Sisters - Take Ya Mamma, The Coors - Summer Sunshine, Benny Benassi - Satisfaction, Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending, The Killers - Somebody Told Me, etc...       Okay I'm gone.. HASTA!     Wednesday, June 09, 2004    Currently Playing Sunrise By Simply Red see related   well here is my post sponer! i know it's been awhile... but frankly it's been crazy! school is out! well... it was, now i'm in summer sessions and working. woop-dee-doo. my first summer in russellville and boy is it FUN.   things were nuts after premiering my piece... still working on gettin it to the publisher. everyone really really liked it, and i listen to it at least 471417988831267 times a week. it's my baby!   i turned 24 WEE! i like even numbers. good times. it's been okay so far. didnt really do much for my bday, but thats normal for me. i did get some nifty winterguard DVDs to add to my collection (i have four now and hopefully five in july!) and a NIFTY framed pic of me and spone that she designed just for me.. i think i'm gonna cry!!  winterguard is my obsession if you didnt know. i just found out about it in 2003, i had heard about it before, but was clueless to how awesome and amazing it is. i love it! http://www.wgi.org   speaking of guard, i made the tech guard for fall 2004. weird huh? i'm kinda excited and kinda nervous. i hope it all works out for the best. i love spinnin thats all i know. and this way i will have marched trumpet, clarinet, and color guard.. nuts isnt' it?! makes me very marketable for job oppurtunities.   i went to riverfest with shane and lee. lee wanted to see brad paisley even though he saw him the night before in branson, and i just wanted to go to LR and have fun at riverfest! so me and shane kinda just roamed around and people watched. it was great! i'm so glad i'm not a girl for many reasons, and was reminded of one of those at riverfest... restrooms. they were practically banging down the guys bathroom doors. it was funny stuff.   memorial day was fun, me and my fam went to the parade in FS and then out to my g-parents. grilled food, sunshine, good times.   then school started.. BLAH! and that brings us here! i think thats pretty much all i've been up to.... okay so i left alot out. but you know how it is.   i'm hoping this summer is going to be as fun as the last. i know fun isnt going to be a main option with all this school business, but hey.. you never know. SPONER gimme a call... i'd love to spend some time with you!!! woop woop. we will turn this town upside down, girl.   ANYWAY, i guess thats all for now.   P.S. all my friends have boyfriends       Tuesday, April 27, 2004   http://lfa.atu.edu/music/band/collage_concert_2004.htm   This is a link to some great photos Dr. Barber took at the collage concert... There is one of me after my premiere if you scroll some..    Monday, April 26, 2004   okay here is the official recording of my piece! enjoy! http://stuserv.atu.edu/clubs/cmenc/hurricaneinhavana.htm    Sunday, April 25, 2004   WOWWWW! This has to be the best day ever thus far. My dream finally came true! My piece was played and it got a tremendous response!! I've never been so happy. I've posted the audio rip from a VHS recording at this address   http://stuserv.atu.edu/clubs/cmenc/havana.htm   Keep in mind its a VHS rip and the audio is pretty bad. I will post the real recording soon! Enjoy.     Saturday, April 17, 2004    Currently Playing Discovery [Daft Punk] By Daft Punk see related  -  well, another week is done. i'm sittin here at work.. wee! i just love yahoo's launchcast radio thing. you can pretty much customize your own station. it rocks! i just wish i could get it in my car. i've given up on radio all together. if i wanted to hear the same three songs, i would just buy the cd's. the pathetic thing is, they have no clue. "Hot, New!" gimme a break. while we are on the subject.. am i the only one that thinks the Daft Punk guys are geniouses? i never can get enough of that "discovery" cd. its amazing! i highly recommend it.  my tush hurts from aerobics.. we jogged around the parking lot thursday.. phew! it was awesome though. i love the instructor. she is so motivational. i need a tape recording of her to get me through my days.   i drove to dover lights last night at like 12:40am.. just to clear my head. it was a great drive. when i got to the lookout there were people there, you know the big rednecks in there huge trucks.. so i kept going. but when i turned around they were gone.. i got out but stayed right by the door! its creepy out there. the stars were AMAZING! i could see a million billion. there was a dover light out, but i did not stay long.. are you nuts?  spooky stuff out there!      so i'm pretty sleepy b/c i didnt get to sleep until 3am-ish. ah well.     we are officially performing "hurricane in havana!" on the collage concert next sunday. WOOHOO! i can't believe it. the premiere!   only one ross and vickie friday left... its kinda weird, she's leavin after the summer for AZ. she'll be graduating along with beth and sponer.. weird. i officially hate being here!! anyway, i'm all xanga-ed out today..   hasta   Wednesday, April 14, 2004    Currently Playing Hotel Paper By Michelle Branch see related  - One of These Days ta da, it's Wednesday! I guess it's time for another exciting post since Sponer keeps givin me a hard time.   I'm doing the usual, watching Dawson's and avoiding doing things I should be doing. What is it about the Creek that captures me? It really is weird to say, but it has been such a big part of my "growing" years. I know it isn't the most realistic show, but the way it portrays friendships and relationships really speaks to me. At least it's more realistic than Saved by the Bell or 90210. Plus I just love Dawson, Joey, Jen, Pacey, and Jack... sometimes Audrey.   The monthly headgames started again... confused? yes. tired? yes. sad? no. Which is good. How can I be sad this week? The symphonic band is playing my composition and it sounds amazing. Everyone has been so kind and they seem to really enjoy playing it. YAY! I just get so excited when we play it... its so weird to finally hear it after all these years. Alot of it takes me back to my senior year, which is weird in itself. That was an amazing time in my life for several reasons. Go figure, me being nostalgic...  I'm going to visit Court tonight b/c we haven't had much time to spend with each other. We gotta have our Chili's gossip hour sometime! We discovered we hadn't had Chili's since spring break. YIKES! So, I"m sure that will be good for me.   Is it pathetic to still be waiting for that phone call? It's only been one full day...  hasta     Sunday, April 11, 2004    Currently Playing This Is the Last Time By Keane see related  - -  Alrighty, so that was a crazy week!  Let me catch you up.  Well, it all started last Sunday. We had our band concert in the "new" performance hall. It was quite nice. Right afterwards we were to change and board the bus... well I locked my keys in my car, along with my stuff for the trip and one shoe... yes I only had one shoe on. Finally, the TECH po-po came and took about 30 mins, but got my door unlocked. I was very worried the bandies would be furious, but no one minded. The trip up was fun, Lona was my bus buddy. We were both sick... thanks Beth.  We watched The Search for the Holy Grail.. it got on my nerves b/c it was so loud. Anyway, we stopped in Harrison and ate a FABOO meal (not really) at Western Sizzlin, then left for Mtn. Home. Yee Haw I tell ya. The hotel was so random. Had an indoor pool right outside our connected balconies. The whole hotel smelled of chlorine. I roomed with Grant, Roman, and Chance and our room was connected to Tiff, Kim, Crystal, and Jennifer. The pool was a source of entertainment for all. Many people got tossed in fully clothed. Not me! I escaped. My quick reflexes. Anyway, we stayed up til about 2am having band chat in the room next door with Matt and Wes. I got about two hours of sleep and then got up to get ready! Our concerts were very good, we are a great group. The kids seemed to enjoy it more in Harrison though. They were ROWDY! Of course, the Mtn. Home concert was 8 in the morning, and Harrison was after lunch. Anyway, it all went well. Hooray. The trip home SUCKED b/c I was so tired and feeling yucky. We finally made it and I slept forever.   Tuesday was Tuesday... I did a big practice alone in the hall for my recital the next day. I felt very prepared. The recital went great. I had a few mistakes, but that was expected I guess. I was so excited to have it over with! And even more excited that all my closest friends got to be there. It was frantastic to see them all.   Thursday the symphonic band read Hurricane in Havana (my composition). It was so fun! The horns amazed me... sounded much better. The whole piece sounded better. I think it has become more musical with the changes I've made. And hey, I did it all by myself!  I think it's pretty damn good.  I went home Saturday to see the fam and the video of the recital. Just kinda chilled out, had some Geno's and came back today (Sunday) and now here I am at work... on Easter Sunday. I guess it's okay for the campus to close down on MLK day, but not Easter. Whatever. Anyway.. that's about it! Minus the details.   Hasta..   Saturday, April 10, 2004   *where the stars go blue*       Well, it took me long enough... but here I am! It was a busy busy busy week. With the crazy band concert/tour, my senior recital, and classes... I didn't have much free time. I'll start bloggin soon. Just wanted to get it started. Hasta for now.     Ross
