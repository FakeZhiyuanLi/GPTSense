      ~the night is alright..well it could be better..hmm..yea..RiRi came back from her tuition every thursday with a guy fetching her home..its not that i dont trust her,but the thought of it makes me feel kind of strange..i wish i could be the one fetching her instead..that would make me feel more secured and to know she's safe as i kinda dont trust any guy with the girl that i love except her father..But i trust my girl alot.. ~aNyways my day was kind of boring,the weather was quite good..windy and stormy abit..as usual i fell asleep but woke up to study maths as i needed to..kind of complicated so i need to improve on that..so many fomulars!! a guy could lose his mind..really!..but well i had to.. =) i couldn't make a promise and break it esp to my RiRi..i did it for my own sake too..yea also,i marinated a chicken this afternoon and cooked it at night since no one was home..you could say i was inspired by a chef "jamie oliver" i think i spelled it correctly.. LoL..the looks of his dishes are great..i could smell it from my home even though its on tv..it smelt great when i tried it out but not exactly how it was done..loL..hmmm also,tonight RiRi nvr gave me any hugz or MuackZ..still waiting for it..but nvm..guess i wont get any.. =(  ~well nothing much happened today i  guess..ill type another one tmr..byez

      I have no mood for anything nemore..i know that i just feel hurt deep inside as i have let her down..so much...by placing all those dumb irresponsible msgges on her blog..am i that stupid not to think twice before placing it there..and now it has to hurt her..im truely depressed,i really need someone there for me and she proves to be the only one..inside it just cant stop burning and hurting me..i wish it could just dose the pain...its beyond description..i ran my 2.4km just for her and got in the third position as it just hurt so much that i dont wanna stop and just feel like running..jus think of making ur loved one disappointed and losing him or her..all i want is to see her smile,that would really make my day when she's really sad and can spare me a grIn..all i want to do is to just make her happy and enjoy chatting with me but i always go screw things up..im really disappointed in myself too..but for now...i understand she has to study real hard and i support her decision and will always be there to back her up mentally if not physically..i need to study either..so i truely understand and support her decision..miss you RiRi...wish could give you all the huGz and MuackZ i've missed..nxt time alright? For now,study hard and ill do the same..dont let nething get into ur concentration..
