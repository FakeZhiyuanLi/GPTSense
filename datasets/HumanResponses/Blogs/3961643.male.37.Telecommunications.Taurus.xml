						       &nbsp;&nbsp; I am once reminded of a saying from the great Taoist Master Lao Tzu.."Fullfillment comes from selflessness."&nbsp; If in our lifetime we could give of our selves freely, our time, our efforts to another human being in need, therein lies our joy and fullfillment, a certain satisfaction that we have done something with our&nbsp;lives that isn't a complete waste of time.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; I often think that I have wasted a vast amount of my time on nothing, meaning, I really haven't become totally fulfilled yet, or I haven't really become enlightened.&nbsp; But I am aware of my responsibilities to my wife, my family and a host of others.&nbsp; I guess in all, I am destined to help people, whether I choose to remind myself of it or not.&nbsp; I do not feel as if this is selflessness at all, it feels more like "responsibility,"&nbsp; is there a difference between a selfless act and responsibility?     &nbsp;   Peace......Tao     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

						   "Trying to understand is like straining to see through muddy water. Be still and allow the mud to settle." Lao Tzu  I think too much, it's a hard fact thatI believe we do too much of it. Aimless and less fruitful than allowing to let thoughts and understanding to flow naturally. This may not be  the easiest thing to understand, but it does follow through with "Knowing through not knowing," or "The less you know, the more you understand."  I guess to some this may seem like stupid drivel, or nonsense, but I have to say that this  thought is so true. Mental effort creates confusion, more than help. Ever try to think of someone's name, and the more you try to think of it, you cannot? The more you stop thinking about it, it comes to you, so goes the thought that the more you try to understand, the less you will be effective in achieving the answer.  Our lives are always filled with questions that we try to answer, and we always face the truth of not being able to answer them, so, in reality, do they need to be answered, or in time will they be answered when they are not so forced?  Not a question I can answer, but it's a thought that stays within me, I guess to be answered in time....  Peace....Tao

						   “Every human being’s essential nature is perfect and faultless, but after years of immersion in the world we   easily forget our roots and take on a counterfeit nature.”  Lao Tzu  My past memories seem to be haunting me lately, feelings and emotions that are apparitions fading in and out of my consciousness.  I don’t like to bring up old memories because I feel as if I have been through to much to go back and feel these things all over.  In my last post I felt it was necessary to go back to be present, or seeing without looking.   I am feeling that way right now and it’s not a pleasant feeling.   At least the moments are fleeting and these presences are only fleeting as well.  I think that painful memories are good to some extent, they may not be pleasant, but they are learning tools that highlight imperfections and of course as we all know, no one is perfect. The Way of Life is to be living according to what is natural, and to not provoke subtle currents to cause a ripple effect on us.  I think what is happening is this, all those previous times where I felt it was necessary to be something that I was not is making me realize that I am an individual, with a different way of thinking, learning and living.  No one has to like it but myself, but at least I am being true to my nature.  I am not causing currents to ripple, I am the current.   Peace my friends………Tao

						   Lao Tzu States that “The Wise know there is no one to go anywhere.  There is seeing but no one looking.  Doing naturally arises from Being.”   Chapter one: My Life, or the way things are (right) now.  Have you ever noticed how the days begin to bleed into one, where the next thing you realize it’s already Sunday and you get to go back to work?  I think age winds us into its clock springs and squeezes those days into our memories.   Days of young where the Sun was tireless as well as ourselves, where the cicada drone was our mantra, we hummed the sound until all thoughts of anything else were diminished and the hypnosis was grand.  Well, those memories are still living in my head, but the days seem less exciting, shorter, and less fulfilling.   Maybe it’s because the burden of where the next meal was  coming from or how we will pay the next bill crossed our minds.  We were enjoying the sprinklers and pools, the summer shade the beds we slept in and never thought once how grand it was that we had all of these things, and now that grandiosity is an inept feeling because we are the ones trying to fulfill those pleasures.  It’s a broken wing that we hobble with, trying to fly beyond the reaches of our woes and into the solitude of past creature comforts.   Lao Tzu was wise when he wrote the above, if we just learn that the cycle of our world comes full circle, someday we will enjoy some of those pleasures again.  Learn to see, without looking ( already I can taste the past in the present), being present both in the past and the present, brings us into the future ( be present and satisfied with what is at hand currently,  then we can understand what we are “Doing” now.    You can know all things are the way they are without looking, or going anywhere.  I know in some ways that statement seems complex, but it isn’t really, it’s very simple because of who we can be….by being nothing else but who we are.  Strip away the money, possessions, and status, and we are the past, but apply that simplicity to your present and realize that that should be your future as well.  We get so mucked up at what should be, when we should  know too well, we don’t exist because of money or other things, we exist just out of being.  Don’t look so hard to remember how things were or are, be present, but not present in your existence today and everyday.    Maybe I am confusing, because it’s written as a paradox, but truly, the less you understand, the less you know….and that is the way it should be my friend.  Peace &amp; Harmony to you my friend……….Tao
