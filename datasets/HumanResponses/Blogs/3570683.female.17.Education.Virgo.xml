      Ok, so I survived  Day 1 .  Plenty of tears and tons of sighs later, we arrive at  Day 2 .  Jonathan should either be in Illinois, or on his way... I'm figuring he's already there, since it's the second  full  day he's been gone.  I think even Zoey misses him, which is sad.  I realized last night, during the sermon from Dr. Loe (sp?) ... well he brought a movie with Kirk Cameron doing a sermon, but whatever ... I was staring off into space, thinking about him, wondering where he was and what he was doing.  I know my family is doing it, too.  I know his family has got to be doing it a lot more often than we are.  But for some reason I still feel alone with this burden.  I had a dream with him in it last night.  I don't remember what it was about, I just remember he was in it and he played a major role. It'll be the third night of VBS tonight, I hope there's something interesting to tape tonight, last night was pretty boring but I think Caitlin still managed to tape over 6 minutes of Sunday night's VBS.  If she did, I will be irritated, but I hope it just didn't record... or that I was reading the timer wrong... either way, I switched out the tapes. I'm tired though, I stayed up last night and did some Bible study.  I finished off Judges and read Ruth and today I start on 1 Samuel.  I'm going to go play  Ratchet and Clank  for a little while.  More later!

      Jonathan ships out tomorrow... but he goes to Raleigh today and I won't see him again for what's looking like 14 months (2 months of boot camp + 1 year of school) before he gets a real break.  Everytime I think of it, I get choked up.  I'm going to be the only one left here.  Caitlin is going off to NCSU and, even though I haven't really really talked to him since last summer, James is going to NCCU and where am I going?!?!  NO PLACE!!!!  Jonathan will be in Illinois for bootcamp and then he'll be in South Carolina for school... he won't even be permanently in state... most likely ... he'll never be here again... and I'll go completely out of my mind... I know he realizes that he means this much to me, he knows how I feel and I know that I have no influence on whether or not he leaves.. I'm going to miss him more than he understands though, I'm sure... I'm going to miss him so badly.  He's the only one that's come to understand me, he knows how to react when I get mad, when to hold me when I'm upset.  He knows how I sleep and how I eat and it drives me crazy that someone that knows me so well is going so far away.  I also know that it's selfish to believe that he's not worried about it either, though he's worried because everything he knows is about to change.  Nothing in his life will ever be the same... and I guess it's the same with my life, except my surroundings won't change and my family will still be here... but I'm whining and it's time for church, the last time I'll see Jonathan in forever... :'( Write more after church... if I can get on (Dad's supposed to get on the computer so there's no telling)  [edit]well, go figure I did get a chance to go on the internet. I found out that I am checking both of Jonathan's e-mail accounts... which should be mildly interesting... he'll get e-mail at the older one and not the other, which means I'll have something to read, maybe.  I'll print off his e-mails (if he gets any) and send them to him in the mail... Maybe I'll ask before sending his e-mails to him, but I'm still going to print them off and you best believe that I'm still going to read them.  But anyways, after church, I bawled my eyes out and Jonathan called me at 2:30 which didn't help because when I got off the phone with him I cried again... but he told me a correction on his e-mail address, and then he was pretty quick to get off the phone.. but I managed to ask him about the Tarheel shirt of his.. that he said he was going to give me.  Apparently, before he left to go to Raleigh (he'll be there now for sure) he put the shirt on the hood of the van, but he didn't come in the house, he didn't say bye.  I can't say I blame him, I would have started crying for sure and I wouldn't want to run the risk of his family seeing me cry or worse him crying or even worse than that, him crying in front of his family with me.  YOUCH.  VBS starts tonight at 6:30 so I better get myself something to eat, since I'm getting a migraine... Much love, more details later =) [/edit]

       Now this issue won't actually have anything to do with showers or naps, but the concept is the same as sunshine and walks in the park, or wildflowers and puppies... happy images, more commonly accepted than my usuals (thunderstorms and sex, lol).  I had the best day yesterday.  I was so comfortable and happy and smiley, and today shouldn't be any different.  It's just one lazy day after another.  My family is going out to the mall in Durham, because me and Jonathan are supposed to be going to a movie when he gets back from Kari's sister's wedding... he's supposed to call me and let me know, because his mom has a crop tonight and he doesn't know which car he's going to have... but it should be good nonetheless.  Even if he just comes over and hangs out, I like hanging out with his Liberal-Nazi butt(-crack face), lol... too many insiders there... I know, I know.  It feels so good to be back at a computer with a "1" key without tobacco juice on it... I'm so glad I can put some actual exclaimation marks in my post this time...  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, sorry, was a little obsessed for a minute there.  Dad and Mom are watching something about Da Vinci... It's pretty impressive.  They're trying to prove that Da Vinci was a genius .. though that's something that we already knew isn't it?  I mean, I've always thought of his as a genius.  There has never been many other words I could use to adequately describe him.  The were talking about  The Last Supper , how the original was done on this plaster.. the moisture in the plaster rose and the paint he used to do the picture, cracked... restorations sometimes did more harm than good... it's a ghost painting now .. but it's a wonderful ghost.  Geez, I wish Jonathan would go ahead and call, I'm getting bored and my family is getting ready to leave, and ... GEEZ.  I'm freakish about being home alone.  I have to have the T.V. on and be on the computer at the same time or I just can't stand it, I'm always consciencious of being here alone... like I feel like someone's watching me, but of course, no one's there so I can't figure out where the feeling is coming from!!  I have to find something to preoccupy myself when they leave (if he's not here yet, obviously...)    Well, I'm going to make a doll... or try to at least.  I'll write more later!

       Wow,  Perpetuity...  what a word.  I think Mom has reached a new level of made up words  She is forever coming up with words I've never heard of, much less know the meaning of.  But no, really,  perpetuity  is really a word.  It means:  1:  ETERNITY  2:  the quality or state of being perpetual [bequeathed to them in ~]  3: a:  the condition or estate limited so that is will not take effect or vest within the period fixed by law  b:  an estate so limited  4:  an annuity payable forever.  ((And for those that don't know::  Perpetual  means continuing forever.)) [[Definitions courtesy of  Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition ]]  But ANYWAYS (exclaimation point) Mom made this comment about having an in perpetuity of evidence that I smiled at graduation because they video-taped it with a cam-corder.  I had ZERO clue what she was talking about (exclaimation point)  I still think she's a geek, even though she's tried to explain it to me several times now...  We went down to my granny and grandad's house so the boys could do some yard work for them.. the borders of the yard were starting to look like jungle greenery (exclaimation point, exclaimation point)  Daddy is getting so tired, so his sugar is getting low.  Mom had to go take him some Pepsi.  He's going to overwork himself, as usual.  Well, at least he won't be able to give me a lecture because I didn't come... because here I sit in front of a computer with dial-up, eat your hard drive internet (AKA AOL) and I'm typing away on this weirdo keyboard (the keys are separated half way down and they stick... and there's tobacco juice on the one key... it's so gross I'm not even gunna hit the key... I did before by accident and my finger stuck to it... EWWWWWWWW (exclaimation point)  (( This would explain my use of (exclaimation point) rather than the punctuation mark. =op ))  But whatever.  I'm trying to think of something that shows perpetuity for this issue, though the length of it should suffice, right Jonathan?  Maybe if you ever get on here and look at this stuff, you might decide you want to get added, and you can blog on here, too.  I'm going to ask Caitlin if she'd like to when she gets back from GU, so if you decide this would be an easy way to communicate with us while you're off in Charleston, my dream home city, *gRrRrRrRr (exclaimation point)* then ya' can just let me know, right? Right, right (exclaimation point)  The font on this computer is so much bigger than the font on my computer at home that it's throwing me off.  They don't have the little clock in the corner either, and me being the geek that I am, I'm skiddish around clocks that aren't digital, so I've been scouring the room for one since I got here, only to realize there's  one  ... the digital reading on the cable box has the time on it... yay (exclaimation point)  Well, I think that's enough for now.  Much luvn you guys (exclaimation point, exclaimation point)

       Gah, I didn't go to bed until 2 last night ... well, this morning, and dad woke me up at 9:30 because he wants me to cut grass.  Not fair, he told me I wouldn't have to cut grass anymore, I could clean the house instead.  But nonetheless, I'm cutting anyway, so this issue won't be too long... Dad's coming in and telling us to go ahead and eat because when he calls us we have to go.    Maybe I'll edit this and write more later!  [edit](1:20 pm) Well, I went out and cut my grass, it took a little over an hour.  I like to cut my grass all at once.  My mom brings out water every 15 minutes because it's so hot and humid today.  I fell when I was cutting my side yard.  There are these little sink hole type things in my yard, and I wasn't looking and stepped in one of the smalled ones, and nearly twisted my ankle and skinned up my knee.  Dad was cutting grass in the backyard when it happened, and it wasn't really looking, but I do think he noticed.  I got up as fast as I could manage, and kept on cutting my grass.  When I got done cutting, Dad complimented my "cutting style".  He said he wished his boys cut as good as his girl.  I was pissed because I was tired, not really mad at anything that had happened.  I'm tired, but not so tired I feel the need to take a nap.  Well, we're going to go to Wal*Mart... again... LOL  M u c h  L o v e ! ![/edit]

       Something that I've been thinking about lately, is something Jonathan mentioned in an e-mail (obviously, I'm thinking about him all the time because he's not home and we're always talking about something on the phone or he's at my house when he's around).  I sent him a long(-ish) e-mail, I've sent longer, but in his response he said he didn't know he'd signed up for my newsletter.  Apparently, my e-mails are pretty long, but then again, everything I write is long.  The post before this one (well that I wrote -wrote ) is about average length for me.  At one point I was using my blog (on the other server), sort of as a chatting forum, but then again, that was kinda dorky too, because I was chatting with Caitlin through the blog, on Trillian, and on the phone all at once.  I was hyper-active and stupid.  But anyways, this will be my first official newsletter!  Yay!  Caitlin and I went together and got our nails done (and the pedicure) at B-Nails in our lil town for Performing Arts.  I think, for me at least, Performing Arts took the place of Prom, since I never went.  Yes, a teenage girl skipping both her Junior and Senior proms.  Oh, boo-hoo, you'll regret that decision, yada-yada-yada ... whatever, I've heard it all.  Prom is just not for me.  But back to my point, I've had my nails done for two weeks (on Saturday) and I haven't cracked, broken or lost any of my nails yet!  *Bows to cheering audience*  It's aaaaamazing!  My nails are usually off within the first week. I don't even really need a fill-in yet.. you can kinda see the edge, but these are looking really good for two weeks.  I might even just keep them like this for camp!  Jonathan comes back from TX on Thuuuuuuuuursday!!!  Yay!  Finally somebody to ttttaaaaalk to!  I'm getting massively hyper (via my typing, not on the outside, though).  Time to put in some Linkin Park and think to thaaat.  Dad said this week we're going down to work at Granny and Grandad's house one day this week, then paused, asking what day Jonathan comes in.  I told him Thursday night, but I probably wouldn't see him until Friday, and we'd hang out then.  Based on that, he decided when we would go down to work, because I need to spend time with Jonathan before he ships out.  Whoa Dad, you're oversteppin them boundaries AGAIN.  Admittedly, I'm still in love with Jonathan.  Love isn't something that just goes away when you break up.  He knows more about me than anyone else in my life, and understands me the best, because he took the time to find out.  But sometimes, sometimes I think Dad is in love with him more than I ever have been. I mean, if you've ever had one of your parents "crush" on your boyfriend/girlfriend, this is definately one of those times.  I put my prayers in my prayer box.  There isn't much space to shove a slip of paper in so I put in the most important ones (from least important to most): Jonathan's trip back from TX, Caitlin in Guatemala, and my brother James, who is still an Atheist.  Between the three of them, they kill me with worry.  I'm always afraid something bad will happen to James, and he'll die without knowing Jesus as his savior, without letting Jesus into his heart and soul and loving him the way Christians ought to.  I don't even love him like I ought to and I'm working on it as hard as I can, praying that God will let his will be done through me, but I feel like I need to keep praying for James.  Caitlin left thinking I was excessively upset with her, and I was, but I'm learning to be patient and understand the situation and I'm not so upset anymore.  I hope and pray she knows that.  I hope she understands that nothing I say will ever be excuse enough for my behavior... because excuses are nothing but cop-outs (something else I learned from Jonathan, blaming the problems and the attitude on the condition ain't gunna cut it).  And of course, Jonathan.  He's always on my mind, always in my thoughts, always in my prayers.  I'd be the one to fall for the military bound one, wouldn't I?  Well, most of the women in my family like them miliarty boys, we just can't settle on a family branch yet.  We've got Army, Air Force, and, thanks to my feelings for Jonathan, Navy.  For some reason, though, keeping my prayers in this little box, feels like they're closer to my heart, at the front my thoughts rather than on the back burner.  I know the box actually has nothing special about it.  It's just a little box on a necklace, it's nothing big, but maybe just having prayers in it, reminds me that I do have something to pray about.  Sooner or later, I'll have to learn short hand so I can fit more onto my little slips of paper.  =o)  Enough for this "Issue."  My fingers are starting to cramp, LOL =op  Much love!!

       I went and got Jonathan's surprise when I went shopping for my camp clothes.  They're all really plain and stuff... but that's how cheap clothes are supposed to be.  I got a couple pairs of sweatpants, 2 pairs of sweat-capris, 5 pairs of shorts, and at least 5 tops.  I also got some underwear and a couple sports bras. I bought this macaroni and cheese *b/c you guys know its my all-time favorite comfort food* at Wal*Mart and this frickin stuff is made with Tillamook cheese.  WTF is Tillamook?!  It's waaaaay too sharp to be touchin my macaroni and cheese.  It's like sharp cheddar on steroids.  I added mozzarella and american cheese to tone it down a little bit, but the steroids won't seem to wear off.  James, my bro, says its not so bad now, but I really can't tell the difference.   But yeah, back to shopping, I bought a prayer box at dollar tree and some clips for my hair so I can do little twisty things at the front of my hair when I get bored.  I have to get a little slip of paper to put in here... I'll go get that when I get done blogging. Me and mom had some serious fun out shopping.  Maybe if I can get her out of the house more often, we'll finally start to bond... I love hanging out with her, something very UNCOOL for a teen to admit, but it's still something I admit openly.  I love my mom! =o)  Me and daddy are pretty close already so I'm not so much worried about bonding with him, and brothers will be brothers (but we're pretty cool right now, too).  Philip and James are watching that gay-bo Digimon Movie.  It's not that James likes it, I think he's just watching t.v. to watch t.v., but Philip still likes that Digimon/Pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh! crap.  He put the DVD in because he thought we didn't have cable, because we lost it temporarily during this killer thunderstorm we had, and by the time it was 2 minutes in, we had cable again... he just hasn't turned the movie off yet.. and it would appear that he's going to watch the whole thing.  I don't know why people find animated card games amusing, but they seem to like them quite a bit considering there's a thousand shows and movies based on them.  Not to mention games, toys, odd bits of merchandising and the cards themselves.  I don't understand the pull of it all, but of course, it takes a lot of mathematical skill to play these games and guys usually enjoy them and I, I am NOT a guy.  Jonathan enjoys Yu-gi-oh, and I know other guys my age that play the card games themselves.    I want to watch one of the movies we rented but the battery in the DVD remote died so it's hard to control the movies.  We always put the captioning on in case someone talks during the movie, we still know what they said.  But without the remote, we can't turn on captioning and it's annoying standing up in front of the t.v. because my brothers scream and yell because they thing their missing something important.  We rented The Last Samuri, Gothika, Calendar Girls, and Big Fish... and I wasn't interested in watching The Last Samuri... Tom Cruise is not what I would call believable in that role... but then again that just sounds like a cop-out so I won't have to watch the movie... but here's a better one:  I DON'T like Tom Cruise, he's an over-rated ugly punk.  And Gothika, um scary thriller type things are not really my thing unless I'm curled up with a boyfriend... or just a really comfy protective guy friend .. he knows who he is.  We're on a roll, me and Jamie have not talked for a week today and it's kinda awkward and I feel kinda bad about it, but there's really no point in getting worked up about it because I don't feel that bad about it.  I am a really strong Republican and definately cannot stand being with someone who thinks Clinton was a good president... because honestly, what good did he do?  I'm not a supported of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for the military and his sleeping with interns was just annoying.  Kennedy did the same thing, in addition to the Bay of Pigs and I have no respect for him either, even though everyone thinks he was a wonderful president... Lincoln... well, fought against the south when we tried to succeed from the Union, we just wanted states rights, and he made it look like a war over slavery.  We just wanted the right to choice because we thought the central government was too strong and state government was obviously too weak.  But back to Jamie and off the governmental issues... Jamie just doesn't cut it for me.  He's not smart enough to hold up his end of the conversation and it's not that he's dumb, it's just we're on different levels... two totally different levels.  It was a mistake to kiss him at Performing Arts, something that never should have happened, but it did and I feel all the worse about it.  Well, I've been working on this for about 45 minutes, so it's time to sign out and try making another doll... YAY!!  Much Love

        I stayed up until quarter after 4 this morning playing The Sims on PS2.  Wow, I was definately zombified.  The first time I checked the clock it was already 3 and I was thinking, well, I'll just play for a little while longer and then go to bed.  So an hour later, not tired or anything I headed to bed... and tossed and turned for a good hour.  Can we say manic??  Geez.  Well, me and mama are going to go shopping in a little bit.  I'm going to cash the 500$ check from Granny (from Graduation) and the 76$ check I earned at work 2 weeks ago.  I gotta buy clothes for camp because I really don't have anything suitable.  I gotta get 10 sets of clothes and some pjs... and in those 10 sets of clothes, I'm including 10 pairs of underwear, 10 bras, 10 pairs of socks, and tennis shoes.  Well, I'm gunna bounce on out and go shopping with mama!  Much Love ..::and more later::..

       urlLink    This is a doll I made for Jonathan during his Samuri obsession (which I think is a current thing).  He went to see The Last Samuri and wouldn't stop talking about it, hence the Samuri.  She has dark hair and green eyes per his request (though if it had been up to me she'd have had brown eyes).

       Well, go figure, I am the only person with zero plans this summer.  Except for my zoo trip on the 22nd and my Carowinds trip on the 24th, I'm not going anywhere.  Meanwhile, Jonathan is in Texas visiting his fam., and Caitlin left this morning for a mission trip to Guatemala.  Jonathan will be back Thursday night, and Caitlin won't be back until the 21st, I think... I don't know, it's a two week trip.  Oh yeah, I'm going to camp this summer with the youth group at church, that's the 14th through the 18th.  So as far as that goes June's not too bad, but July will definately suck.  Jonathan ships out on the 27th for boot camp in Illinois, for the Navy.  When he first made the decision, we were still dating and it really freaked me out.  I was so scared to lose him.  Now that we've broken up, well, I'm still scared to lose him, but now that we're best friends, I understand that I don't have much choice, and I've learned to let go ... to a certain extent.  I'm still trying.  He has faith in me, now all I have to do is learn to have faith in myself.  I always get the feeling that Jonathan is the only one that has faith in me.  Dad is always reminding me that the messes I'm in are messes I've set myself up for.  It's harsh and it hurts.  Somehow, Jonathan finds a way to tell me that I set myself up without coming off so frickin harsh.  Caitlin only seems to want to spend time with me when Jonathan is around, and only, it seems, in an effort to keep me away from him.  If it's not her way, she doesn't want to have to deal with it.  Her attitude is starting to seriously bother me and it's getting to a point where I'm not afraid to tell her to her face.  Too bad I'll have to wait for her to come back from Guatemala to tell her that.  My parents are watching something about WWII on the History channel, pretty disturbing stuff.  I hate thinking about this stuff, but the thing is, it happened, and as an American, I feel the need to know these things.  We can learn from the past mistakes and it needs to be remembered as graphically as it was.  If not, it doesn't have the impact it should.  Men got their legs blown off, women and children were gased and burnt in furnaces by the hundreds and to our generation it's nothing but words, nothing but old stories that don't seem to mean anything.  Well more later  Much Luvn

       Well, I finally found someplace decent to host my blog.  My friend, Caitlin, had shown me a site to do it on, but it either started charging or shut down, I don't remember which.  But anyways, I decided I would add some of the stuff I'd been thinking and add on some of the dolls I've been making lately.  Over the summer I make pixled dolls and during the year I just run out of time during the day so I don't make them.  I'm going to have to figure out how to load pictures onto Blogger, so I'll be able to share them.  I'll add more later when I get done playing with the set up!! =)

      Well, obviously, I'm getting along just fine, since I'm not on here spilling my every thought like you people even cared.  No, that's not sarcasm.  My youth minister freaked me out tonight.  As soon as I walked in, he pounced on me:  Derick (that would be my youth minister): I have the best news!!  Guess who called me last night?!?  Me (with a very obvious fake smile): I don't know Derick, who called you last night.   Now you would figure Jonathan would have called him, as excited as he was. But no:   Derick:  Mrs. Fauble called!   Pause... Derick must be waiting for me to ask the obvious question. Simple, simple man... so I humored him.   Me, patiently: Well, what did she say, Derick?  Derick, disappointed:  Well, um, we weren't home.  Me, patiently: So how do you know she called?  Derick, happy again: She left a message!   I felt like I was talking to a small child with a severe case of ADD.  Whenever he wasn't being prompted with a question, he would quietly sit there, with an excited look on his face... and just not do anything.  Face marred with a huge smile and yet, no sound would come out of his mouth.  Times when you can't shut him up, but then when you want to know something, you get nothing more than a 1 sentence response.  It's his limit.   Me, patiently (you have to be patient with him sometimes): Derick, what did the message say?  Derick: She has Jonathan's address at camp!  Me: Do  you  have the address?   I almost said it, but caught myself.  Not enough details he wouldn't have known what I was talking about.   Derick: No, but Marcie is going to call her back tonight and get it.  The moral of this story?  My youth group still thinks me and Jonathan are a couple and that I am dying to know any information about him.  They think I will visibly crumble without him and I guess I'm  NOT  so I  MUST  be in shock or something.  Quick, get a wool blanket ... and suffocate yourselves.  LEAVE ME ALONE!  Yes, he is my best friend.  BUT I AM DOING FINE WITHOUT HIM!  GEEZ!
