       This is the sickest thing I have ever read and I feel very, very skeevy, as if I have walked through spider webs and can't seem to get them off of me. What the hell is wrong with people? Do people have that much insanity and free time to go through with  urlLink this . (By the way, this is not for the squeemish, but it is really news.)

       Author and attorney Scott Turow discusses the American legal system and all of the above mentioned subjects in a very  urlLink good article from the Guardian . Turow recounts the events, evidence, and the politics behind the false conviction of a Hispanic man in the murder of a 10-year-old girl in Illinois.

       Here is the ugly truth about performing beyond the expectations of your higher-ups; you will ultimately be fired or eliminated. Just like this  urlLink poor schmuck from Sweden .  This is a point I have seen illustrated, not only in real life, but in the movies, also. Like when Colin Farrel's character in  urlLink Minority Report , who is the only person doing his job perfectly, gets a bullet in the head from Max Von Sydow's character for all of his brilliance and hard work.  Remember to always perform at your expectation level and to never stand out or look too good, for fear of them cutting you out of the herd for slaughter (or unemployment).

       After dealing with salesman, mechanics, and my own gnawing sense of dread over my crapped-out car that seemed to permeate my entire existence, I decided to treat myself to a viewing of  urlLink Open Range  along with some whiskey and Mike & Ike's candy.   Go rent Open Range. Robert Duvall is awesome in it and everyone else is great. And the gunfight at the end is very realistic, almost as if you were watching parts of it on the news (if they had had the technology back then). There is also an interesting and entertaining piece on the making of the movie, that is almost like Costner's video diary of the entire project, that is on the Special Features disk.  Good stuff.

       My car's clutch just went this morning on the way to work. Great. I had a feeling it was going to go yesterday on my way home from class, during which I had to stop and feed the beast oil becasue it is leaking in several different places and demands the black giver of life be poured into its guts as payment and supplication for geting me to work every bloody day. My ten year-old piece of crap with no air and a blue book value of nada on a trade-in is useless and I am stuck here at home searching for a good deal on the net and in the newspaper.  I am so f-ed...crap.

         If you've visited my other  urlLink site , you have seen my tirade against Best Buy for their terrible customer service and their lying and deal-breaking. Today, I will tell you about my experiences with Adelphia, the cable and ISP company.    Now I had Adelphia provide my digital cable and DSL line for a decent price, until November of 2003, when I received a notice that they were hiking the rates in my region.  Now I had signed up for a package that said  I was to have digital cable, HBO, and DSL for a set price for 1 year, and my year was not up until March of 2004.  I called said company and waited on hold for about 15 minutes, after which some guy in their Pennsylvania call center tells me that my area is no longer competitive and that his company, Adelphia, should still honor our agreement.  But there was nothing he could do about it, I had to call my local reps.  Great, another half-hour of my life I will never get back.    I call my local center, do my obligatory 15-20 minute hold-the-line and listen-to-shite-music-and-ads until some woman lets me speak to her. After forty minutes I iron out the fact that Adelphia may have made that agreement with me for a year of set prices, but I didn't have any proof and there was no mention of it in my file-how very f-ing convenient. But behind door number two, I am told that I will have to only pay for the price of my digital cable for December and that the DSL will be free. They only ask that I consider keeping the HBO at the increased rate, which I tell them I would do because  urlLink Carnivale  had three more episodes and my wife and I had to see the finale (I know, it was like crack and I was addicted). In other words, "Yeah, we broke the deal  and you're screwed because you can't do anything about it, but here's a little gift-now please go away and remember to give us your money for sub-par customer service and an average product.  Buh-bye."                Oh, but it does not end there friends.    I get my stupid bill from the stupid company and the adjustments to the bill are not on there.  I call these a-holes again, hold for 15 minutes again, and then have to reiterate the past two conversations I have had with Adelphia, and after another hour of back-and-forth bickering, I am told that although there is no record of this second agreement, they will honor the deal and to send my check in. Again, more time I will never get back, stolen, along with my money, by Adelphia.    And you thought it was all over, didn't you?    Now it is the end of December and I have decided I don't want to pay the rate hike for the HBO and call to cancel it, which is done the minute I say I don't want it anymore. Instantly, my HBO goes blank. Wow, those Adelphia guys sure are at the top of their game when they are taking things away from their customers, aren't they?    Bastards.    So January rolls around and my statement comes and they say I owe them a ton of money, which I don't.  By now, like me, you know the drill with the call center and I lose another hour of my life and the bill is settled.    I hate them. I really, really hate them very, very much.    So the mail comes and my wife shows me an ad from another cable and ISP company. And the rates are awesome and we are locked into them for a year.  I call new company up and order service, then call old, dirty Adelphia up and tell them I want to cancel my service with them at midnight - so I can check my email and watch TV that night. And of course the idiots screw things up and turn off my service immediately-good day to you sir!    And the moral to this story is don't take crappy service from corporations who are underhanded and don't respect where their livelihood comes from. Use the most powerful weapon you have to fight these jerks - your money!      Oh yeah, and get a blog or soapbox and tell everyone you know or anyone who will listen to you that the lying, cheating corporation gives terrible service and that they should avoid them like the life-sucking bacteria that they are.    There, now I feel better.

       Welcome to  Kung Pow Pig .   For those joining the story in progress, I finished the script for the  Hotchpotch  graphic novel and am awaiting edit notes from the  urlLink Stenarts  artists, Thorsten Kiecker and Kai U, in Berlin Germany.  Look for an August release from Paquet Editions in Europe (or maybe someone else? we're still negotiating).  Of course the book will not be published in the USA, unless I can find a small or independent press to get it into the shops.

        urlLink This is a shame . Aristide is about to fall, maybe be murdered by some of the same death squad thugs that left the country when the American government, then under the Clinton administration, helped restore free elections and democracy to one of the poorest countries in the world.   I remember when Baby Doc's dictatorship fell. I was living in Miami and my school was near Little Haiti, a section of downtown Miami where poor Haitian refugees could find cheap, broken housing.  These same refugees fled Haiti because of the death squads and lack of democracy. When Baby Doc fell, the Haitians took to the streets in joy. Do you think their happy now?  urlLink Do you think that our government's washing their hands of Aristide's democratic government and allowing terrorists/rebels to overthrow a sovereign government is right?  At a time when our nation needs to improve its worth, we are only decreasing our value on both economic and moral fronts.  If it was Cuba and not Haiti you could bet your ass we'd be in that country now, or at least allowing their refugees into our country, which we are not doing with the Haitians. The reason for this is because our government, from Florida Governor Jeb Bush to the President don't care about Haitians because they don't vote republican like the Cubans do.  And if you think we won't feel the urlLink  ripple effects  of this coup, you're wrong.  urlLink Studies of complex systems  prove  urlLink the connectedness of entities  within the system. And Haiti is a country we have had dealings with more than once in our history, beside the fact that they are off of our coast, in our hemisphere of the world.

       I find it amazing how many people are actually scared or worried about two people getting married. Sure, there is the gay thing, but they are still people after all. Have you ever been friends with a gay person? Did you know anyone who came out? You know that their the same people, no different than you and I, they are just attracted to people of the same sex.   Beside the fact that this country was founded on the separation of church and state, which our president repeatedly cites in his  urlLink opposition to same-sex marriages . This whole thing goes into the same basket as the freedom of speech; you may not like it, but you should defend the rights of that person to do it.   What if someone told you couldn't marry the person that you loved? Do you think that's right, just, or fair? This is the same thing, and if you don't see it that way, then maybe you should deal with that little fear in you that is scared to death of people than aren't just like you.

I say tax the hell out of the porn industry. If the government has to get involved, then tax them so the federal government gets revenues for the actual regulaton and so the American people get something back besides getting their rocks off. And if they regulate this business, see to it that these actors get some profits and benefits. Poor stupid schmucks.

       OK, I know about the possibility that there may have been life on Mars and I do find it exciting and fascinating, but I still have to ask why Mars? As  urlLink this article  illustrates (indirectly), we have places on our planet that are just as inhospitable as Mars. At a time when global warming, population growth, and deforestation are causing problems and will be future problems to contend with, why go to Mars? Why not spend those billions of dollars on researching what has gone wrong on our planet so we can fix it before we go to another planet and find out what went wrong there? We live here, now.  urlLink Not on Mars .   See; starvation, low water supplies, rising temperatures, deforestation here on our home. On Mars, same thing as the desert;  urlLink a 259 day journey there , and no people.

As Washington pushes forward with missile defense and a bonus round of NATO expansion, Russian generals are bristling, while Russia’s command and control system continues to deteriorate, increasing the chance that misjudgment, error or sabotage could trigger a missile launch against, say, New York City, which is still targeted for a couple hundred megatons.  urlLink According to those analysts who never took their eyes off the nuclear threat, the danger of a missile exchange between U.S. and Russia is actually greater today than during the more stable periods of the Cold War."

       I know all about that self-fulfilling prophecy crap, but I have had several people tell me how bad their week is going and how they knew over the weekend that this was going to be a bad week. (And, I know many people who are having quite a shitty beginning to their year, which could be attributed to the  urlLink year of the monkey , but who can really be sure?) I, on the other hand, am not having a bad week. I have used up all of my bad weeks for the year in the last three weeks and am hopefully over the hump and coasting my way to good times. Now, I just have to concentrate on my programming courses and fill out reams of internship paperwork so I can graduate and go on to make more money, because eventually, a future baby (yes, I am planning to procreate because the world is ripe for another intelligent person like myself) will need a new pair of shoes somewhere on down the line.   Oh, and 33 is just like 32, but with more financial attachments and responsibility and zen-like acceptance of life, and more appreciation for the people who are your parents. Because I am turning into my father (and that is not a bad thing).

And from Israel:   urlLink Israel on alert after Hamas vows revenge   And this:   urlLink "The team of ministers ... decided this afternoon to adopt the recommendations of the professional teams and not to appear at the hearing which will start on February 23," Sharon's office said Thursday.   And South Korea chimes in with this. Way to go South Korea! Don't they make Hyundai's over there? Do I really want a Hyundai-quality clone of anything?:   urlLink "Scientists in South Korea are reporting today that they have created the world's first mature, cloned human embryos -- an advance that could speed the development of new therapies but also brings scientists a big step closer to being able to make cloned babies."   Now it's your turn to sound off, Haiti:   urlLink Opposition groups in Haiti have cancelled a protest march against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide after reports of violence in the capital. Barricades of flaming tyres have been set up along the march's route, and gunshots are said to have been heard.    And is this a form of natural selection or just stupidity:   urlLink In the United States last year there were over 11,000 deaths by firearms. No other nation comes even close to matching this appetite for death. That is eight thousand more than died on 9/11, but about the same number as those innocent Iraqi civilians that perished by our actions in Gulf War II.   Don't you feel all better now?

As for LOTR, the entire trilogy is amazing and is worthy of some great award. And if I had my picks for Best Picture, they would be:    Lost in Translation   Open Range   Big Fish   LOTR: Return of the King   The Last Samurai

       Since I am both asthmatic and have allergy problems,this  urlLink article was interesting . I wonder if this has something to do with everyone and their mother smoking over in Europe. Now I have to check the numbers in America.  And here's some more  urlLink info  about asthma.  And here are some facts from this  urlLink place :           Asthma has increased over time in the United States.  In 1980, 3.1 out of 100 people had asthma.  By 1994, 5.4 out of 100 people had asthma.  This is an increase of 75 percent (MMWR, 1998).         The largest increase in asthma was in children age 4 or younger.  In 1980, 2.2 out of 100 young children had asthma.  In 1994, 5.8 out of 100 young children had asthma.  The rate increased by 160 percent (MMWR, 1998).         The number of children ages 5 to 14 with asthma increased by 75 percent.  In 1980, 4.3 out of 100 children had asthma.  In 1994, 7.4 out of 100 children had asthma (MMWR, 1998).         Asthma does not affect all people in the same way.  The burden of asthma is greater among blacks, adult women, and boys.         10.6 million people in this country have an asthma attack each year (NCHS, 2001).        The asthma attack rate is higher in children than in adults.  5.3 out of 100 children have an asthma attack each year.  3.9 out of 100 adults have an asthma attack each year (NCHS, 2001).        The asthma attack rate is higher among blacks than whites or Hispanics (NCHS, 2001).  5.0 out of 100 blacks have an asthma attack each year.  3.9 out of 100 whites and 3.6 out of 100 Hispanics have an asthma attack each year.       Blacks also have higher rates of hospital stays and death due to asthma. These rates are three times higher in blacks than in whites in the United States (MMWR, 1998).

       I picked up my car yesterday and on the way home Salazar (that's what I call my car because my wife and I found yelling, "Damn you, Salazar!" to be quite cathartic) broke down. The engine siezed on the highway followed by the sound of grinding engine parts and black, putrid smoke billowing from the engine and tailpipe. All this, after I shopped around for the best deal from a reliable mechanic and am now out $400 and a car.   And if you don't think the world is a shite place because of that, let me share some wonderful headlines from around the f-ed globe and right here in my own state of Florida.  urlLink  "Body of missing Sarasota girl found; mechanic charged"   urlLink "Explosion on Moscow Metro Kills 39"   urlLink "Skin-Deep in Jehad: Pakistani Groups Sell Animal Hides for Terror Funds"   urlLink "Tenet denies CIA exaggerated warnings on Iraq arms"   urlLink "Ricin Attacks May End Writing to Congress"   urlLink "Man Lives with Dead Brother for 18 Months"   urlLink "Boys, 11 and 12, Charged With Raping Girl in School Bathroom"   And there you have it. All is not right with the world and my paranoia and dread grow daily. It does not help that on the way into work I walk by a city government building and see the newest terrorist security theat warning posted on the front door. It doesn't help that I have watched the play-back of an 11 year-old girl getting abducted, only to have the first thing in my ears from my rental car's stereo tell me that she was found dead behind a church. It doesn't help that I think 2004 sucks. Hey, wanna know a warm and fuzzy fact? We are losing at least one soldier a day in Iraq. A bit scary, don't you think, that I am actually looking back on 2003 with the golden-hearted tinge of nostalgia for the good old days of weekly code orange terror alerts and the middle of America's mass unemployment.   So that's how I feel, that's what I have to say. F%*k 2004. F%*k it right in the ear.   And have a nice day.

       In the head today:  Must reorganize my schedule to better accommodate studying time for my Advanced C and C++ homework. F%*k! My car! Hoobastank's new CD rocks. Must learn more French. Knowing how to ask where the WC is and ordering a cafe is not enough. This requires total immersion in the language and from now on that's just what I'll do. I will no longer communicate in the English language, only in French. Salut! Comment est la vou? Pa mal. Je suis Adrian. Je sui american. Je vudre un cafe, sil vou ple. Merde. Joder. Cono. (Just felt like cursing in Spanish.) And good news - the car repairs to my hydraulics in the clutch will be a $100 less than I expected. And from another mechanic (the first a-hole was trying to rip me off). It feels good to have narrowly escaped a pillaging from some bastard grease-monkey out to get his filthy hands on my hard-earned cash. Get down!

       Because Guiniverre's Coffee Shop and Art Gallery is closed for some artist's party. I'm here because I want a double espresso (or a doppio in Starbuckinese, or Italian). The line is pretty long, so I look at the sale items because I can always use a trusty travel mug. There are a few for sale and I find one I want and take it back with me on line. As I reach the cashier in his green-aproned statement that says  I know about coffee and you don't , I ask, "If I buy one of these cups, do you give me the coffee for free still, or do I have to pay for the cup and the coffee." Which Starbucks-boy replies, "Yes." Well I am thinking yes what? Yes yes, it is free, or yes no, it is not? And now I am considering making the test true or false for everyone's benefit.   So my puzzlement and silence prompts him to speak forth, "If you buy the cup, you get a ten percent discount off of the drink you order." Ten fucking percent? Why don't you just give me a penny off the total cost of the drink and not insult me with ten percent? Especially when it used to be that you got the drink for free.   "I'll just take a double espresso, thanks," I say as I put the cup down, after which Sparky with the afro asks me if I want a doppio? Now I feel like yelling at this schmuck to not indoctrinate me in the ordering of coffee, that your secret language of drinks does not wash here. Instead, I nod and walk to the second line which is made up of a balding, pot bellied, middle-aged man in corporate get-up; tie and white shirt, navy-blue pants. Thank god I can wear jeans and a t-shirt to work.  Then I hear a Starbuckian yell, "Non-fat soy, double decaf latte!" Baldy looks at me with this sheepish grin as if we're in a porn store and I can see the filthy title of his wack material that he has selected for his viewing pleasure, and I cannot hide my disgust for his woossy drink order. I think I would have been more impressed if he was taking home some gay porn with a title like "Ass-spelunking Man-Cave Adventure."   So baldy takes his non-fat soy double decaf latte and hightails it outta there and I watch him go and think,  my god, when did men become such pussies?  This poor bastard brings home the bacon and he can't order a freaking latte...with milk, from a cow?  Just castrate us all now and pass the non-fat soy double decaf latte.

       I have two programming projects, tests, and I am trying to increase the funny factor in Hotchpotch. On top of that, it is summer again (at least in Florida).

My grass is growing at an accelerated rate already and mowing into precious creative and study time.  And I hate summer. The only good thing about summer is that the little sullen brats that attend the nearby school won't be trapsing across my lawn and littering it with their candywrappers and other junkfood paraphenalia.  And another thing about summer vacation for all of you people who call yourselves parents out there; because it is summer does not mean that you get to take a vacation from being a parent!

If you'd like to see some of the places we went you can go here:   urlLink Basilique du Sacré Coeur    urlLink Musee d'Orsay    urlLink The Louvre    urlLink Opera Garnier    urlLink Rodin Museum    urlLink Harry's New York Bar

       And these keyboards are hell. Hey, look at that, I just found where the period button is.   Paris is beautiful. The Hotel Langlois is great. We are in a  nice quiet neighborhood a few blocks from the Opera Garnier, which is amazing, with its gold statues at the top. We also went to Musee d' Orsay and looked at the impressionists like Degas and Monet.   The French have been very kind, but they sure like their rooms hot, like 80 degrees F HOT. I am outta here before I die of dehydration.

But back to  Kill Bill Vol 1 . I have to say that Mr. Taratino impressed me. Loved the story, loved the Manga scene, loved the fights, and laughed hilariously at the  gallons of blood  spewing out of peoples bodies! Holy crap!

You don't realize what clean, fresh air really is until you breathe in a deep breath of the real thing. And that is what you get, or used to get when you went to Gatlinburg - crisp mountain air. The first time I had ever seen mountains was when I visited Gatlinburg in the early 1980s and I remember thinking that this is what we mean when we sing the song "America the Beautiful," which has always meant a little more to me than "The Star Spangled Banner". There is something truly poetic about the former, and not the latter song that reminds me of what a beautiful country this use to be and maybe could be again.   And now thanks to our own national avarice and the present administrations ignoring of the global warming conditions and its rendering of the EPA into an impotent agency, we just might be  urlLink kissing the Smoky Mountains goodbye.

        urlLink Spring  is here and it is time for  urlLink Judeo-Christian  resurrections and messiah bunnies carrying cold, colored hard-boiled eggs. Spring is here and it is time for a change and a rebirth, my own personal resurrection as it is, will be forever and ever, amen.   And what's to change, you ask? For starters, attitude. I am going to be the meaner, leaner, more focused Adrian. I have no choice, with a constant stream of out-of-town visitors, weddings, and two giant coding projects and finals all coming to a mushroom cloud head by the end of May, I have to be at the top of my game.    urlLink "April is the cruelest month,"  but its showers and hard work will bring May flowers and good grades and a degree. And then I start taking care of business, meaning I start looking for a job that pays what I am worth or I ask for the money I am worth, or both. Mercenary Adrian goes to the highest bidder because I am 33 and angry and have wasted much of my youth and am behind on where I need to be.  And sure, I have been stressing myself out, but I have no choice. I am just going to have to take these bad dreams and sleepless nights in stride. Never mind that I want to scream at the top of my lungs right now, giving voice to all of my frustration and anger. Never mind that I feel like I am trying to knock down a brick wall by slamming my shoulder into it over an over again.  Hell, never mind this post.   Arrrrrrrr. Back to work.

       We went to see  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  over the weekend and it was very weird and cool. I love this low-tech approach to sci-fi and speculative fiction the director and Kaufman applied to this story. It makes the characters seem to matter more than they usually do and amps up the reality of all of the strangeness invading these people's lives.   urlLink Focus Features , the people who brought you Lost in Translation, look like they have taken the inventive-solid-story-telling crown from Miramax and are consistently producing very thought provoking cinema.  If you like indie movies and speculative fiction, check it out.

        urlLink Merck pharmaceutical company has decided to cut thousands of jobs in the US, while hiring thousands more in other countries.

       Since I've been out of school I have been reading a hell of a lot. I took back my  Empires of Sand  from Jacqui, then our friends Mike and Cathy leant us  The Da Vinci Code , which I've been wanting to read since before my trip to Paris, for reasons that are apparent if you've read the book. Jacqui finished the bloody book in three days and leant it to me, right as I am nearing the end of the first book. And  I started it last night and can't put it down (damn you Dan Brown with your heretical knowledge and esoteric trivia).   Speaking of secret societies and magick history, if you liked The Da Vinci Code, please read  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco . you'll love it!

If this is true, it proves that the torture was implemented by higher-ups in the armed forces and government. It also means that we are losing even more of our almost already spent moral highground, and that means we are becoming the bad guys. Even worse, it means that other people around the world are going to start believing that the terrorists may be the "good guys" and that is not good for anyone.

       Bill Moyers discusses how the media is controlled by several individuals with very close ties to the GOP. Something very important in wake of all of the censorship being practiced in the media. Here's an excerpt:   urlLink "That's Sinclair's prerogative, of course. Every news organization has First Amendment rights, just as I'm exercising mine right now. But speaking out is one thing, keeping others from being heard is another. Sinclair censored Koppel."   I remember when we didn't censor so much; the economy was good, more people were employed, and we weren't being force-fed lies. If you don't like something then change the channel. If you have children watching, be a parent and take care of what they watch and explain things to them. Don't give up your rights and your power to others just because it makes your life a little easier. Do not let people tell you how to think and act and live because there are people out there who are more than willing to make every decision for you. This is not a daycare. We're all adults and should act accordingly.   You know what's right. Do you really need someone telling you how to feel and what to think every second of your life? We should all be responsible human beings that are accountable for actions.

Well, you could use your vote (if they decide to count it) or you could write emails to your representatives, or you could support an organization that aims to either prevents and defends your point of view. My suggestion is to Google the things you care about and visit those sights and find out how you can help make the world a better place.

       Many  urlLink psychological experts are commenting that the prisoner abuse in Iraq was too precise in its details to be the product of a bunch of low-level perverts  having fun. This article goes on to also explain that the way the interrogators were acting is in-line with people following orders and with nothing to fear because they were doing their jobs.   And there is also  urlLink a record of prisoner abuse throughout Iraqi jails, documented by the Red Cross .  A little fact: Did you know that  urlLink 90% of all Iraqi prisoners are innocent ? That's a statistic from our government.  What sickens me, besides the picture of a woman standing above naked, hooded men while smiling and wearing a  latex glove, is that anybody is willing to use the excuse of "just following orders" when that's what other war criminals that our nation has pursued have used in their defense.

       I don't know why I have been thinking about the miniseries  urlLink Wild Palms  lately, but I have, to the point of obsession. Or is it synchronicity? Maybe it's just this time of media overload with someone trying to make you buy their take on the world, trying to sell you their virtual reality and make it the reality. It was only a couple of weeks ago that Wild Palms, with its Mimozine and religious-political overtones slipping into my conciousness, that I found  urlLink The Wild Palms Reader  on sale (half-off) at Virgin Megastore. This movie haunts me. It has always been below the surface like a meme sleeper-bomb or herpes, just waiting for the right/wrong time to go off.   Or maybe this blurb from Amazon says it all: "Set in Los Angeles in the year 2007, a study of an American society in which the national economy has collapsed follows the machinations of ruthless Senator Anton Kreutzer, who plans to win the presidential race by using Virtual Reality technology. TV tie-in." I'll leave you to draw your own parallel judgements.  And unfortunately, there is no DVD of Wild Palms yet. I could get it on VHS, but I am  DVD snob and I would hate to purchase the movie twice, in case it does come out on my favorite video format. At least I have the Wild Palms Reader to keep my fix at bay, for now.

With the lives of 118,000 men and women who are about to be put in harm's way, is a national draft far behind? If you think it isn't, I covered this in a previous post a few weeks ago. Unsurprisingly, I Googled House Resolution 163 (the proposed reinstatement of a national draft) and could barely find any  urlLink reports of this very important resolution for a draft that is still floating around congress and the Pentagon.  And the original link that I had to the US Congress's site has been removed. So why isn't anyone talking about this?

        urlLink The Senate passed this $447,000,000,000.00 (it looks a lot bigger with the zeros, doesn't it?) defense bill late last night, unanimously.  That means not one person did not vote against it. Not one. The bill also includes $10,000,000,000.00 (10 billion dollars) for a missile defense program. Do the terrorist have missiles? Does Russia even have any missiles anymore? I know China does, but China, despite being a communist country, knows what is what and would never try to destroy the top buyer of its goods, namely us. Attacking and killing you best customers is bad business. The North Koreans you say? Like that little psycho dictator can afford to start a war. He's too busy oppressing his own people into submission to worry about anybody else except South Korea.   Of course they voted down a portion of the bill to aid Veterans health and prescription drug assistance. We won't patch you up, but you can go get shot. And how bad does your life have to be to join an organization that puts you in harm's way but won't help once you're out of danger?  I understand the money that is going towards giving soldiers a pay raise. Those brave, unlucky bastards more than deserve it, but why ten billion to a missile defense program?

Well,  urlLink it seems Michael Moore has borrowed the title of his new movie from Mr. Bradbury, without his position or a nod to the author .

If you have never read  Fahrenheit 451 , or any Bradbury for that matter,  urlLink check this out .

        urlLink Studies have found that some dogs can predict when a child will have an epileptic seizure before it occurs.  Up to 42% of families with epileptic children and dogs said that their pets responded to seizures by either becoming protective of the children or trying to "help" the child.  Oh, by the by; dogs rule.

       The Pentagon, the center of our military, wants to place undercover spies in our own country. As you may know, the military and the CIA are not allowed to operate domestically because a nation that spies on itself and has a military presence in its society makes it ripe for a coup or a totalitarian fascist state.   That is why Rome never allowed its army to enter the city. That's why we don't allow our greatest tools that protect our country abroad to operate within our own borders.    urlLink But it seems some people in our armed forces, intelligence community, and government are all for a domestic spy network that is answerable to the military.  And that cannot be a good thing. If there is a domestic problem, we have the FBI and the police to deal with that. Are they saying that our FBI is not up to the task of protecting us from spies domestically? And why do they want to have this kind of intelligence gathering capacity used against our own people?

        urlLink Wouldn't it be nice to have a job where people (lobbyists) gave you stuff like stocks in companies and new cars almost for free so you could help them out? Just become a Senator or Congressman and you and your loved ones could be swimming in affluence.    Collegiate athletes have very strict guidelines in how they should act and who they can accept gifts from, and what kind of gifts they can accept. The NCAA is a lot stricter in policing their athletes than we are in policing our elected representatives.   I think the extremely lucrative position we put our public servants in can be related to  urlLink Alan Moore's  Watchmen  . In that book, Moore asks the question, "Who will watch the Watchmen?" Who will police the people who make our laws? Obviously, having the people who make our laws police themselves isn't working. I know that they try to implement campaign spending laws and set-up oversite committees, but essentially what we're looking at is a club where if anything is done, it isn't done to make a big impact on the status quo.   Do you remember the last time Congress past a law that impacted the way we live? I don't think we can say the Patriot Act or creating the Office of Homeland Security really impacted our lives because I think they are pretty ineffectual. IF you think I'm wrong, just fly the unfriendly skies and see for yourself. I think the last time our government passed any law that made a large impact on our way of life was either Roe vs. Wade or the Civil Rights acts of the 1960's. And do you remember what they did to the guys that helped push that through?  One brother was murdered in Texas, the other in California.   It seems our laws are only designed to maintain the flow of cash to the right people and not effect any real change. And who wants to change anything really? I mean, do you really want to be  urlLink killed while driving through Dallas  or  urlLink while talking to people in LA ?

       Ephraim, a friend of mine, says that we are in the shitter both financially and morally. He tells me there was a time when people used to have values like not putting up with anyone's crap and giving them a good punch in the face for being a no-good bastard. He tells me that this is what the world needs now - some good old barbaric justice.  urlLink You want to skirt the letter of the law to screw people , you get a punch in the f-ing face. You want to repeatedly lie to my face, reach into my wallet, and then pat me on the back as if you're my friend, you get a f-ing punch in the face.   It's that simple.   Ephraim tells me that once, a big kid used to torture everyone around him in his second grade class. All Ephraim wanted to do was keep low, not get noticed. He knew, from playing chess, that the bully had a better run of the board than he did, with Ephraim not being a white kid and rich. Ephraim also knew that it was only a matter of time before the fit hit the shan the bully would find him and all of his differences and weaknesses. Sometimes Ephraim would dream about kicking the bully's ass and having all the girls and boys in the class like him and cheer for him, but that would not happen. That only happened in movies like My Bodyguard and shit.   That day came when the bully found him and punished him good as the same kids he once imagined would befriend him for standing up for them only cheered as he got the snot beat out of him. And you know what Ephraim thought about that day on the ground with granular, crunchy dirt in his mouth and the copper penny taste of blood running down the back of his throat? He thought of Christ on the cross and how he hated everyone and how Jesus wasn't there to save the world, he was just there to make someone else feel better and more powerful because it was not them getting the crap kicked out of them. And after that thought, Ephraim lost it and gave the bully a a black eye. He still got the ever-loving shit beaten out of him and got a detention, but at least he did not go down without a little dispensing of some justice.   And Ephraim tells me that sometimes you just have to hit them hard and make them feel the pain. And people tell me that I'm angry.

Valerie Plame and her spouse have claimed that she was outed because her husband, a former ambassador, had publicly disagreed with the Bush administration on its policies.   Looks like the Supreme Court-appointed president is worried about criminal charges.

       I get a fifteen minute break at work to not be at my desk and get some  me time. The last thing I want to do is talk to people I either know from work or don't know at all. Yes, I am an antisocial fu*k and no, I do not want to change. You see, when I go for a walk around downtown on my fifteen minute break I escape into my head and either think about what I have to do when I get home or how I can better myself or what life would be like if I was indestructible, masked, and had a secret underground lair.   So yesterday afternoon I am walking down the hallway on my way to the stairwell when some broad in tight pin-striped pants stops me and asks if I work on this floor? Yes, I reply I do, and keep moving hoping that she will leave me alone or is only asking for directions to another suite. She moves with me and asks if I know about the vending machine and who she could contact about getting her fifty cents back. As I keep moving toward the stairwell door she goes on about how she put fifty cents into the machine and hit the specific buttons and waited for her bag of chips to fall, but nothing came out and she would really like her chips because she put her money in and she did not get anything and that there is no contact number and there should be one because there usually is one and she has no chips and can't get her money back. Are you annoyed yet? Because I was. I smiled, nodded my head and kept moving. She must have followed me about thirty feet yabbering away about her lost f-ing money while at least twice I told her that I did not know anything about the machine other than that a man comes every once in a while to refill the thing. Sorry. Gotta go. Good luck.   And I am in the stairwell and out the door and on my break. Jesus, I thought she was going to start beating me for losing her money and being out a bag of chips.   I guess she really wanted those chips, huh?

You do not use a shotgun to hunt a tiger.  As a matter of fact, the Geneva Convention says that shotguns are an inhumane weapon.

       When did we become a nation that cannot make a decision? The last time our government, which is supposed to be an extension of the people, had to make a decision it was thrown into the hands of people who are not supposed to be deciding politics and policy. During the last presidential election,the use of the Supreme Court, a judiciary branch of the government, in deciding our electoral process was strange and in the gray area of constitutionality.   I think our inability to make decisions as a nation and people started with lies. Lies complicate things beyond measure, adding complexity to an already complex system, our government.   The lie in question that started all of this confusion and ambiguity was the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the creation of the  urlLink Warren Commission  to investigate the event. When, after years of investigation (and I use the word loosely) and the destruction of evidence by intelligence agencies and other government offices, we were given  888  (isn't that a fishy number in an  Illuminati  kind of way) pages of an indictment that was reached in an inept and clumsy manner. It took years for the commission to decide that one man outwitted the nation's security and made a very impressive shot that killed, in my opinion, the last president who made decisions that truly changed the status quo.   Which brings us to today's CIA, which is yesterday's CIA, and the skewed information provided to   Bush's White House as grounds for the war in Iraq and yet another  urlLink committee's 12 month deliberation in finding that CIA was at fault  (by the by, I found this on  urlLink Disinfo ). Which is really no answer because we can't decide on what kind of pressure the White House used in obtaining the info from the CIA or if someone outright lied.   Welcome to the Status Q; nothing has changed and I don't think anyone really cares as long as the gas is relatively affordable and we can all still put food on the table. And I guess that's the answer right there. We just don't care. And in keeping with my geekiness, I use an example from science fiction, namely Frank Herbert's  Dune . In that book, the status quo is being fought to be maintained by the people who have the most to fear from change: The government and big business. Remember, "The spice must flow." Or the oil must flow. Or the money must flow.   It's your world -  Change it .

Pediatrics Professor

       I first read about this idea about three years ago and wondered if they were ever going to go through with it: One of the ways a spacecraft could travel long distances without using up all of its fuel  or having to carry a large fuel supply on the trip is by using large solar sails that use protons from the sun to push the craft through space. And  urlLink the Japanese are currently testing solar sails for future space flights.

       Besides it being baseball season again, I can't explain why I have been watching so much baseball. I used to watch football, but they have so many damn commercials. Every time some football player grabs his crotch they have a round of commercials. If anyone from the NFL is reading this:  Please stop having so many damn commercials because it slows down the game.  At least in baseball you know it's supposed to be a long game. Plus baseball has the whole team effort thing in the field plus individual talent thing with the guys going to bat, and you don't have some monster getting injured every fifteen minutes, which only means more commercials. And baseball also has math in the batting averages and earned runs allowed averages, which I enjoy comparing.   And  urlLink the Red Sox beat the Devil Rays last night.  Again.

       As if reading this bloody blog is not enough, here is what's making the ole cogs in the electro-chemical noodle twirl:  I'm reading Don DeLillo's  urlLink Underworld  and am in awe of his 60 page prologue that is like a long steady-cam take ala Scorsese in Goodfellas that encompasses a kid jumping a turnstyle to enter the Dodgers-Giants World Series in 1951, down on the field with the players, up in the press box, and in a box with Jackie Gleason, Frank Sinatra, and J. Edgar Hoover on the day that the Russians exploded their second atomic bomb. This is amazing writing like Ellroy on  American Tabloid  and Burroughs in  Naked Lunch .  Also reading Carl Sagan's argument against the fantastic in  urlLink The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark . Although he makes some valid points, I am not entirely convinced that just because we can't measure it or it explain it that it does not exist. Sure, there are some real looney toons out there, but you cannot ignore the repeated patterns of some of the strange things that people encounter around the world.  And I'm also reading Barry Glasner's  urlLink The Culture of Fear , which is a look at how the media plays-up rare occurrences to "increase awareness" and fear, how certain organizations do not represent statistics properly, and how conservatives with money can sway people's opinions with labeling and exaggeration. You know what I fear? Stupid people and Bush in a second term.  And I'm trying to tweak my resume. Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

       If you like acts like Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews Band, and the Dixie Chicks, then you can attend a concert to support the voting of Bush out of office (provided his friends don't find a way to illegally re-elect him again).  Go to the  urlLink MoveOn PAC page  and check it out. You can  urlLink register for advance ticket purchases , too.  For you Florida residents: Pearl Jam is coming to Kissimmee and the Dave Matthews Band are going to Gainesville.

       Richard Sita is a hero. I don't like to use the "h" word, but it seems to warrant use when it comes to Mr. Sita. What else do you call a guy who risked his life and was tortured and beaten to help save the lives of a group of kids? And now  urlLink Mr. Sita, who was given political asylum by the US has, thanks to the Patriot Act, been imprisoned for almost a year without a fair trial.   Without a fair trial, without evidence, through circumvention of the Constitution. And this is America?  ( found through  urlLink Disinfo  )

       Maybe we will get those flying cars soon, or at least a jetpack, maybe (Man, do I want a jetpack!).    urlLink Pentagon backed science is working on a way to shoot particles of energy at biological matter to freeze it in place. These new "directed-energy weapons" are even trying to boil the liquid in a human body using microwaves , supposedly to be used as a deterrent and make it very uncomfortable for people entering an area they are not supposed to be in. These weapons sound like alien invasion weapons from H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds or something.   They also sound pretty damn scary to me.

       Author Rudy Rucker has a guest-starring blog on  urlLink Boing Boing  with some very interesting things going on, like Chaos, fractals, and things about writing. My favorite quote from him is:   urlLink I think the blog is the start of the lifebox, that is, the electronic copy of one's personality.    I agree with this. This is why my tagline is "Adrian Langton's conciousness on the web, uploaded on a regular basis." This blog is my digital imprint on the web. Even my friend Mike checks the blog before he calls me to see what kind of a mood I'm in or what kind of a day I'm having. Sometimes the anger scares him, but the world is not a perfect place and if I can't change it, then I will complain about it.
