       Here is me again, doing  my chemistry homework on biopolymers... would help if I knew what a biopolymer was again, but that's beside the point.... school hols end today, technically, because tomorrow's the weekend :( that's not good - I really liked the holidays and I'm so tired already and term hasn't even started yet :(  &nbsp;  My little brother's playing the computer (as always) and he's playing Avernum the shareware copy - rather fun, but addictive and long and I think I have to do some work - I can't wait until&nbsp; the HSC's over then I can do it all over again next year...&nbsp;for most people, I think that the end of the HSC is a period of time where you can forget school - for me, it's like 'ah done that now let's do it all over again' ah well can't wait until next year then me is off to uni!!! YAY!!!!  &nbsp;  is it just me or is the 'create' thingo different - I don't remember being able to change font, font size or font colour before.... maybe i'm just silly and inattentive and all that jazz (aagh! - not again)  &nbsp;  Still love Josh Groban. Still want his other CD. hmmmmmm which reminds me I haven't been on Ebay for a while.... let's go get other CD I think :P&nbsp;  _________________________________  Le mie mani stringono

      now I'm figuring out how to use this site - it's a pretty good setup actually, except I don't know what to use for a display pic (I suppose I'll find one someday when I can be bothered but I'll just remain faceless for now I guess)  I really should be studying for the trials which are on in about 3 or 4 weeks or something like that and I have the distinct feeling that I have chemistry homework due first week back - I know that I have music homework due and an english assessment task.... and don't ask me about physics - I wonder if the HSC does this to everyone or am I just insane? hmmmm  I'm still a bit annoyed at the hairdresser who 'wrecked' my hair (i.e. changed it to something I didn't want at the time - I suppose it'll grow on me and I'll get used to it and not mind so much but at the moment.... - I take 'layered' to mean 'having 3 or more 'layers' of hair', as opposed to 'having 2 short bits at the front which look really silly because they're uneven too and look like I'm trying to grow out a fringe or something'... ah well I'll stop complaining about my hair and go do some work now so I'm allowed to go shopping in half an hour (yay!)  ____________________________________ But I'll always remember... you're only an ocean away....

      Thanks clay for this very nice site hey this is going to be fun pity about the other blog that I had... somewhere.... it gone now I bet I haven't seen it for at least 6 months ah well and I can rave about stuff here and use it as a place to store most of my insanity so I appear maybe even vaguely normal to anyone else.... hmmm no chance.... ah well I'll go back to listen to Josh Groban again - currently my idea of the best singer on earth because it's not like full-on opera but it's not pop either it's kinda like a mix between classical and pop and rock, hence the name 'crossover' hmmmm but its really cool and I guess it's an added bonus that he looks kinda good as well ;P *goes away and stops drooling - just jk* but I think I'll stop raving now it may be bad for my health  Punctuation? Who needs punctuation? ____________________________________ Nobody is perfect I am nobody Therefore I am perfect :P

      ello, ello, ello.... I seem to have neglected this blog a bit, don't I? ah well, I guess that I'll write something now because I probably won't have the chance to in the distant future.....  Letsee - school's back and this is the first weekend already!!! it's amazing how time flies - thursday was the athletics carnival and i got sore from doing nearly nothing - running the 100, 1500 and picking up shots from shotput all day - I like the helping thing with y12 it got me out of doing a lot of running.... then again, the 1500 was quite painful  The Bond CD finally arrived after all that agonising - it's nice to know that Sam got the CD 2 weeks and 2 days before its release in Australia and I got to listen to it :D so we are a few of the privileged :P and mum's been listening to the Aled Jones 'Higher' CD from the library - I didn't really like him at first but he's been growing on me... I've just got something against males with a really high singing voice whose voices have broken already..... but Josh is still my favourite - still addicted to Oceano, I'm going to get the music book after the HSC can't wait!!!!  actually, I can't wait until after the HSC for a lot of things - no more English, Chem, Physics, IPT (well I'm going to miss IPT) but I get to start learning drums!!!! yay!!!! and then I can get a whole heap of sheet music!! YAY!!!! and then there's summerfest, and the trip to malaysia and I can't wait!!!  Mr H lent me his Rubik's cube book - I can solve the first 2 layers in about 3 minutes now - not too bad for only 3 days worth of learning... but I still can't do the last layer (the book's instructions are a bit weird at times) - I think I'm turning the bottom layer the wrong way when it says 'clockwise' - ah well.....   discovered  urlLink www.nerdparadise.com , fun site, still don't know what I'm doing there but such is life - it's a good boredom killer in between ebay auctions I guess :P and I really should be doing some work since Evie so kindly reminded me that the HSC is less than 100 days away.... or maybe not :P  __________________________________________ A Elbereth Gilthoniel Silivren penna miriel O menel aglar elenath!

       I love that song! I like the lyrics too :D Very appropriate for me at the moment :P ah well, I'll stop going through depressed period and babble a bit more     &nbsp;   Church was good this morning, Granite was OK tonight, I'm going to Walcha next weekend though!!! (NYSF selection committee thing) and missing a whole host of stuff for it.... (i.e. YF, music practice, Barton Lane soiree, Church, singalong, Granite, h/w..... I'm going to have to take the h/w along with me I think since the English is due on Tuesday after that)     I wonder what's new since I last posted... been losing track of the time a bit and getting really tired and depressed :( wonder why.... hey I posted yesterday???? wow it seems like it was a lot longe than that... and it's only 11pm? it feels like about 2....     &nbsp;   The Rem Urasin concert was pretty good on Saturday night&nbsp;- it's a pity about the last half... and Joel kept sniffing&nbsp;- have I had a gripe about this already? no, I haven't - and he fell asleep twice in the first half (which was the best half) - on Joanne's shoulder the first time!!! ah well, I guess he'll learn to appreciate it (when I was 12, I didn't like it that much.... still can't take the Chopin from the 2nd half yet - like eating cheese that's been really aged I think (now there's a weird&nbsp;analogy)     &nbsp;   I can't believe I'm still listening to Sarah Brightman (I think I'm getting over that under-ripened cheese, so to speak - the songs are really good but the singer... well I'm getting over the singer....)     &nbsp;   I think I'll go away now before this post turns into a majorly depressed gripe and get on with life :P    ____________________________    We shared emotions    Found new horizons    But now doubt pervades me    I say another prayer in the night

      doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo dooooo  I'm happy again - silly mood swings :P now I'm talking to 3 pples on MSN and shopping on ebay and doing blog at the same time....I found the Idea of North CD 'The Sum of Us' - very very addictive.... fun to sing.... I love the arrangements for a cappella and the jazz harmonies....  I'm trying not to be buried by work as I go through the traditional y12 silly mode right b4 the trials - we're sooo tired... but no more English or IPT assessments!!! :D :D :D :D :D  youth group was really weird - playing with raw chickens :P and I think I'll stop the overloading multitasking and just post this now... _______________________________  There's a line between love and fascination That's hard to see on an evening such as this For they both give the very same sensation When your lost in the magic of a kiss Her lips are much too close to mine Beware my foolish heart But should our eager lips combine Then let the fire start For this time it isn't fascination Or a dream that will fade and fall apart It's love, this time it's love My foolish heart

      Well it looks like my mood's decided to swing the OTHER way now.... :P It's been ages since I last posted here, I'll have to stop being so lazy - I think this is good for my self-expression abilities or something, or it's just something that I reckon's cool and fun to do therefore I will do it for the sake of it - sounds good to me!  Went away to Walcha last weekend, NYSF interviews on the other side of the panels this time - it was really fun, actually, and an eye-opening experience into the way that interview work - now I know what pples are looking for in interviews... I'd always viewed the other side of the table as a kind of unreachable area - now that that's over, I know that I've got there and it's amazing to think what I've just done - I've just helped to determine whether some of 31 pples are going to have one of the most prominent experiences in their lives, and which of them will have driven to Walcha for nothing and will have to be disappointed - then again, there were a few of them that really shouldn't have even gone for the interview - it was good of them to give it a go, but some of them were really not cut out for it.... like 'where is Australia's nuclear reactor?' and 'where is Australia's monolithic rock' and 'who is the president of your rotary club?' - if they couldn't answer those questions, I didn't really believe that they had the right to participate in a SCIENCE forum sponsored by ROTARY where they would require some thinking skills.... but it left me very tired that weekend did.... got to know Tim better though, he's actually a nice guy - so's the rest of the interviewing committee, but I'm glad that I chose the panel that I did :P I think I scored the better personalities, maybe not the most accomplished with their intelligence (except Errol, he was amazing!)... It was so weird that I got to call them by their first names too!  I was up until 2am this morning - finished English (50th gate) at 1 to 1:30, then I got hooked back on the Cube again... that thing is so addictive and bad for me, but I have to admit that it IS a time-filler.... NO MORE ENGLISH ASESSMENTS EVER AGAIN!!! YAY!!!!  Listening to Bond - sometimes it's great just to sit back and relax :D oooh I forgot to mention that we got a PS2!!! It feels like it's been around forever, but we only got it last... tuesday??? it feels like ages though! but we've got singstar and ddr and ratchet and clank so me and joel have heaps to play :D ___________________________________________  Lovers in the long grass  Look above them Only they can see where the clouds are going Only to discover dust and sunlight Ever make the sky so blue
