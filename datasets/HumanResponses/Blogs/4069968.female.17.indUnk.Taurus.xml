           [musik] - Franz Ferdinand "Tell Her Tonight"    [mood] - bouncy     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   hung out with the group today.&nbsp; or...last night.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; ben and sarah were dressed in their clown gear so we decided to go to taco bell with them.&nbsp; it was fun.&nbsp; though no one really was surprised.&nbsp; apparently they must get a lot of clowns in the stupid place?     &nbsp;   kosta called randomly while we were eating, and chris kept asking if it was the "child molestor."&nbsp; Not as bad as chris' however...&nbsp; but anyway.&nbsp; i was too busy laughing at ben blowing up a heart shaped balloon and calling it an empty ball sac. &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   now i'm bored and only semi-tired.&nbsp; i got up around six-thirty yesterday evening, but hanging out seems to make me sleepy.&nbsp; meh.&nbsp; i said i would do something with K tomorrow.&nbsp; but if i never go to sleep i doubt it'll actually happen.     &nbsp;   blah.     &nbsp;   and now jamie needs someone to go with her to the movies to meet the guy she met off the internet.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   boob.     &nbsp;   jessica told me that franz ferdinand is coming to town this september.&nbsp; hm.&nbsp; maybe i can get the monies to go.&nbsp; although it's not actually going to be that expensive.&nbsp; i can take jamie...or someone.&nbsp; i love that freakin' band.&nbsp; happy voices and happy music.&nbsp; or...semi-happy music.     &nbsp;   oh well.     &nbsp;   it's slightly better then really sad emo.

       [musik] - Bright Eyes "Sunrise Sunset"   [mood] - bored     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    mwaha.&nbsp; i finally got one of these stupid things.&nbsp; i've conformed to what all the kiddies are doing with their ::xangas:: and ::livejournals::&nbsp; not that i'm bad-mouthing the idea.&nbsp; i think it's kind of fun.&nbsp; to complain about your day to strangers and the occasional handful of friends.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   yep yep.     &nbsp;   so it's late, since i've have yet to go to sleep.&nbsp; ha.&nbsp; my mother gave me half a xanax in the hopes that i would be in bed before seven this morning.&nbsp; what a joke.&nbsp; i didn't even get semi-drowsy.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   so...yeah.     &nbsp;   half excited and half nervous about school starting.&nbsp; and no, it's not those cute little first day of school nervous jitters.&nbsp; it's "what am i going to do because leonard will be gone and this is my last year?"&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; suddenly i want to get insanely lost in my own head and never come out.     &nbsp;   kosta called earlier, having a weird ass breakdown of sorts because he was feeling that his life was going nowhere.&nbsp; i didn't know what to say in response really.&nbsp; it was...i don't know.&nbsp; i experience the same thing a lot, but i just don't know how to deal with it when it's another person.&nbsp; my people skills suck.&nbsp; i couldn't exactly tell him, "hey it'll be ok and you'll figure it out" because that would have been a lie...i don't know if it'll be ok.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   o  ne can only hope it so.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;
