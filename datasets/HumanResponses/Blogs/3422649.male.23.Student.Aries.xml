            Okay, so this is my first post on Blogger.com. I did have a blog of some sort on Xanga, which is another one of these webblogging tool sites. I found out about this webblog site from Call For Hell on TechTV last night. The sad thing about that is that it was the very last Call For Help, which was running on TechTV for six years.       Most of the people that watch TechTV know that TechTV was bought out by ComCast, one of the largest cable TV providers in the country. It will be combined with ComCast current video game network, G4 on May 28th. When my parents were looking to get rid of Adelphia as their television provider, I suggested when they went looking for a satellite option, that they get a package with TechTV included, saying it was a really cool station to have. The way that I ever knew about TechTV is after I was on a trip to visit my best friend Jon at SUNY Fredonia, we stopped by another high school friend Angela's room, and watch it. After the parents bought the Dish network setup and the package with TechTV included it soon became the channel that was on the family's living room television most evenings. With the announcement on Leo LePorte's blog on Leoville about the fact that ComCast was buying out TechTV and that most of the people currently on air were to be fired, in many ways it seemed like soon we would be going back to standard broadcast stations, since most of the other channels offered on the Dish are pointless.      I was going to be the first one to lead the charge against the ridiculous killing of one of the best television channels out there, by one of the country's largest mega-cable-corps. Besides, it seemed in a lot of ways that G4 was complete crap, and all that ComCast was going to do is try to kill off something that was better all around channel that actually had good content and organization then a straight up completely console and computer game focused station. After seeing a bit of the programming being preview on TechTV over the last few weeks, all hope might not be lost. The first program that impressed me was Icons, which talks about the history of some of the biggest video game makers in the world. It also answered one of my longest unanswered video game questions: "Why is Final Fanstasy RPGs always call Final Fanstasy, if there is about 11 of them now?" Other programs such as Filter, which has a hot Asian chick on it, and Arena that is pretty funny since they are doing play-by-play of Unreal Tournament 2004 games might be entertaining at the very least.      So, I guess at the moment ComCast will be spared my wrath. But with the lost of Call For Help, the only consolation is that The Screen Savers will be saved, along with X-Play. Gentlemen, we all know what is the best think about X-Play is not their rating system but Morgan Webb.      With all that said now, I'm off to do some more research on the differences of PHP, ASP.net, and a good forum creating tool.
