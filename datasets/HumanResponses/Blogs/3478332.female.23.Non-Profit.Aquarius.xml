      {is trying to cut down on smoking}  {...might be 'slightly' grumpy}  Its 3:55AM here, which is no biggie, 'cause I got up like 4 hours ago. Didn't sleep fo 2 days and kept trying yesterday. Finally got some rest, it sucks that now I have a headache...but what's a little pain. What really sucks is that I'm broke, which is a relative state of social being, its also only relevant right now b/c I actually *want* to buy something...sumthin' that doesn't include cigs or coke. Have tried to cut down on my nicotine intake 'cause I reached a pack-a-day. Its not even a struggle, which is kinda disappointing, yet comforting. Listening to   Gackt   and trying to suppress my fucking angst which I can feel creeping up on me. For these feelings I blame fucking Mattel™.  Mattel™ has a line of dolls called "My Scene"...a tribute to metro-sexual shiny-ness and being "crazysexycool". The great minds in marketing have made a nice animated video which features its popular, smart, artsy, sophisticates on "Spring Break" in Jamaica. The only reason why I'm still here, is that not only couldn't I find my gun, but being slightly disoriented from lack of sleep, I couldn't even locate the bullets in my pocket. Anywayz~ our super friends of cool, have fun in the tropical sun - all the girls have long hair which blow stylishly in the wind, the boys look liked they've been neutered and lathered in gel. They ride around in a red convertible, they go boat-sking. Its all beautiful. To quote one 'character' "I love Jamaica!"  I didn't see it, so I can't offer objective criticizm of the plot (PWP?), I'm just ranting on the images. When designing the dolls or even this show, what exactly were the creators thinking. Were they on drugs...are they pilz-popping, Blender-reading (the magazine, not the appliance), MTV-loving fuckers....or were their perceptions warped by an alien source intent on destroying us, speeding up the inevitable d00m as it were. Well whatever I think, these *people* deserve to be taken by the Klignon Armada and made to feel the wrath of some pissed-off British football fans. Daily some asshole complains to me about there being to much 'homosexual' content on tv, that u shouldn't show that stuff 'cause kids might get *ideas*, yet I'm sure these same assholes will sit their spawn infront the tv to watch this fucking bullshit and even happily purchase these "toys" for their kids. I mean, they're so fucking special! The perfect consistency of body types, the make-up and trendy clothing! YES!!! We must all be skinny and have friends that are exactly like us, we must all have skin that range from light tan to darker light tan (WAIT! not *too* dark, it'll clash with everybody else...same goes for pale) If you are a girl, know that your're beauty depends on the lenght of your hair...and that your girlfriends should inevitably have hair your lenght! Otherwise, they're total rejects n' should be locked outta' sight until their hair goes out. Also guys, please! I mean like keep in clean, dude! U like so need to neaten up those curls...here! Have some gel! OKAY!! Now that that's arranged nobody eat! EVER! I mean, look at these cute clothes, and these GAP™ cargos. We have to look the LOOK y'know. But if u *do* hafta eat, I don't know why...like if your muscles start to melt or sumthin', then please be considerate of the group and find a bathroom (fast!) and throw that crap up. Bulemia is only uncool if u talk about it so lets not. And if ur teeth fall out u can buy new ones, maybe even in trendy mega-watt white (saw that on VH1) and if u get acne, there's like pilz n' stuff for that! Okay! We can't have flabby tummies in the group, I mean u'll totally stand out! Right! yeah!  *bile*  Apart from that ever-genki message of self perfection, there's the little problem of vacationing on the island. I mean I love when people show these cliched, steel-pan playing, palm trees waving; images of islands ~ *really* I do. I mean I live in the caribbean, I can totally promise that its bliss! Well I have heard these stories about the extreme social inequity in Jamaica, where the minority rich exclude the majority poor from, oh wellz, just about everything. But I'm sure that's only b/c they wore the wrong shoes or something. yup! And I mean sure there's alot of crime and police violence, but its not like u can see it from the exclusive white-sand beaches. And you can totally go take a drive up the mountains and see like all the pretty flowers n' stuff, I mean the patrols aren't looking for tourists....and as long as u drive really fast and stop for no one I'm sure u won't get shot at like once even!  So yeah, basically these Britney-luvin' creatures make it high on my list of people to be put against the wall when the revolution comes...I for one feel kinda nauseated having to even contemplate this crap. Especially when lately people comment on me getting "skinny" and they ask y, and I tell them its prolly the smoking, and they laugh...'cause I'm really funny. And I feel all sorts of guilty self-conscious, b/c I'm *not* skinny {pats tummy with affection}. And so I'm gonna go have some coffee and chocolate cake....and maybe make some further preparations to my bomb shelter, just in case of a freak meteor shower or sumthin.  eat and be merry, ttfn.

      "Do children really understand the things you did to them?"  Have spent the morning in preparation...making sure to get some snooze, some day-time fantasy, and some funny reading done..."Man Your Battle-Stations!!"  I've learnt that this is the best way to deal with meeting my dad. Otherwise there's bound to be some pain and Radiohead later. I don't see myself as a victim, but my reationship with my X-chromosome donor has been fucked up for ages. When I was a little girl I worshiped him, the basic Elektra Syndrome...later as I grew older, read more and came down from my cloud, I began to notice that's things weren't so simple. Its b/c so cliche that people expect it...we've grown so used to ending our meetings with anger that we congratulate ourselves when we don't end with death wishes.  Cannot really conjure up the will to deal with it anymore, to ask myself why. I just leave it alone, and pray to be left the fuck alone, to not blip on his radar. Last year I got the bright idea to shut him out, to act like he didn't even exist. That ended when he began to  not-so-subtly manipulate my younger brother. Maybe its b/c I'm the product of a divorced house-hold, though to me it started long ago, but I've always been protected of my siblings. Not to the stifling point, but in the way that if u fuck with them, u better hope u have health insurance. So after witnessing my brother's distress, I decided to forgive...if not forget. So what, I told myself; if this is the person that's dis-owned u countless times, abandoned u, and called u a whore. Big deal, there's therapy for such things. But witnessing him pick another victim I couldn't handle. Now its not so bad as it was before...Having spent those months in denial of his existence were sufficient to separate myself from his antics. There is still an effect, but its mostly negligable. The prep, just a pro-active measure.   Still there's the passing broody thought, as to what happened? Why this disaster, I have friends who also have bad relationships with their parents...is there a why? I plan to never have kids, its not something I need and I don't relish the idea of fucking up some other person'd life just b/c I feel the primitive need to pass on my less-than-shibby genes. Kids deserve better, than anything I have to offer. Where do people get the selfish nerve to insist on having kids neway? I know that that sounds maniacal...but I really don't understand. When ur life is spinning outta' control, isn't it obvious that to u should not be responsible for someone else's existence? Doesn't that just mean ur fucking sadistic? People have kids, then simply push them out into the world, to let them be moulded into whatever fucked up, bible-thumping, satan loving , dog-killing little asshole that they will be. They take great pride in their accomplishments, paying tribute to their own genetic endowments, and then curse them when they fail. We give birth to them for the child-labour which we pay with allowance, and for the joy of having someone to ignore while we watch the news or some other crap. We plop them infront the tv with out so much as a backward glance, and wen they're old enough and have already been stripped of their induviduality by schools, and imprinted with society's social norms, we impose all of our unrealised dreams unto them. Like some cactai we bought, in blood and then raise fitfully with much ignorance in the dark...  For the love of God/Jesus/Jehovah/Yaweh/Krishna/Shiva/Allah/Gaia/Lilith/Satan/The Galactic Empire/The CIA (whoever the fuck u think is ruling ur Fate) there r 6 billion people on the planet. Stop with having the kids, give it a chance. Know that there's no need to do that to someone, and ur DNA is about as fucked as everyone elses'. Stop it...'cause when the revolution comes u will be first against the wall ~

      {stares @ blank screen}  {lights up cig...finishes}  {brain: activate}  Hi (echoes in the empty shell of cyber gloom) its 1:58am in my plain of existence and I've decided to start a weblog, to spare my friends from my noxious habit of ranting to them in the early morning hours when I have nothing to do. Not that I ever really *do* anything, but I think its a good idea. Tried this yesterday morning, but there was yet another black-out, and if I hadn't grown fucking used it, I'd prolly go around reeking social upheaval. But that's the thing with living in 3rd world bliss, u learn not to notice things, better still, u learn not to care.   Its raining now, and I luv it...its the most fucking beautiful thing to sit safely esconed while a tropical thunder storm has fun outside. Its mostly ended now...usually I like to play in the rain. It makes me happy, it does the soul good. But I haven't danced in the rain   for over 1/2 a year. Last year I had a bad cause of the flu, which led to bronchitis, which led to a slight case of pnuemonia. My doctor called it slight, I called it me losing 3 weeks in unconcious gloom. I don't sleep well, generally...haven't since I was a kid. I never get those cool dreams that people remember, the only recollections I ever get r nightmares. So imagining what it was like to be asleep for extended periods isn't hard, I'm in no hurry to go back there. Better to leave well enough alone. Have taken walks in the rain though, mostly b/c I was too apathetic to seek shelter, haven't gotten sick luckily. I like to think I'm not really afraid of alot of things...sleep isn't one of those things. As Poe said; "Sleep, those little slices of death. How I loathe them." I get where the guy was coming from.  "Fear is the Mind-killer,  I will face my Fear, I will let it pass through me, When it is gone... Only I shall be left."                         - Frank Herbert,  "Dune"   That pretty much sums up how I feel about fear, supposedly true bravery cannot exist witout fear, that's fine. I don't need to be the fucking hero. I just like to think that I could walk out my house @ 2:14am (current time) and not have to worry about being mugged or raped or abducted. And generally I don't. Here's were the rant becomes ranting: My country has recently been under the trend of serial kidnappings, alot of times the only way the victim suvives is by escaping. The kidnappers don't really seem to put alot of thought into their victims, they take whoever they want, or whoever appears to have money. I'm not a rich girl, hell I'm a slacker, I have a bank account (with no money) simply b/c I went to school and needed one. Today the police impounded a car that had been stalking the neighbourhood...the expected targets were either my house or my aunt's next door.  *fabulous*  Its fucking fucked, now everyone's all bunkered down in their caves, hiding. Like it really solves anything. Criminals have guns, they also don't give a fuck if u've properly locked all ur windows. At least that's the way it appears to me. If it all goes to shit, I'd like to think I'd be able to recover...I think alot about the worse things, it gives me breathing room. When u've made peace with the inevitable fucked-up nature of the world,  its' hard to let it bother u. It might have been ok, except that earlier this year, someone (some jackass posing as a private investigator) tried to kidnap me. I was blissfully unaware, this was handled by my parents and the police. However, 2 within a matter of months doesn't bode well. I suppose the reason y I'm still around to type nonsense is that I'm not really into exiting my house...fuck, sumtimes I barely leave my room. If I do its in the late evening to return late @ night.  Now, I can pretty much wave my excuse for socializing goodbye, its no biggie really. I wouldn't care, except for the trapped feeling. The awareness my folks keep around them about where I am at all times...*sighs* I have something resembling a good relationship with my mother, in that we've both learned to tread lightly...with my father its harder. Mostly I go weeks, sumtimes months without talking to the asshole. My folks r divorced, which is fine, b/c it never bother me, and prolly never will...but my dad and I have always had a tumultuous relationship. He picks today, when I'm trying to take a nap (in the daulight when its safe) and he call with the raging on the phone about how I'm no longer to be allowed to attend classes without someone dropping me and picking me back up. I was mostly groggy, so I didn't really get to respond, this piece of conversation lasted :46 secconds. It really fucking cheers me that the asshole ignores my utter existence and then suddenly when it occurs to him that my presence may no longer be there to *be* ignored, he suddenly devolops....a conscience. Or whatever the fuck it is. Supposedly he's coming to 'visit' later, I've asked my brother (younger) about this, and he seemed pretty pissed off and said he had no fucking idea. My idiot father seems to have some kinda fetish for fucking with my head...and when I ignore or am otta' reach circling the outer solar system, he picks on whoever's at hand. I rant alot about my father...thankfully he's stopped affecting me as much as he used to. I still get pissed off, but he's no longer able to make me depressed...this is a very good thing. Used to be that after one of our meetings or brilliant phone calls, I'd spend hours (days) locked in my room listening to Radiohead (O.K. Computer) and recently, chain smoking. But to him I say "ha! bitch, no more, begone with u!" Have not done that in the last few times I've seen/talked to him, including today's little flash. I decided today to make an actual effort and not smoke to much....since I was nearing a pack-a-day. So far, have only smoke 3/4 and that's ku.  If this was too bouncy, who the hell cares really....its a rant, u want plot, get a book. Currently reading "The HitchHiker's Guide to The Galaxy" - Douglas Adams. Arrived in the mail today thanks to an uber jolly english pal~ Laterz
