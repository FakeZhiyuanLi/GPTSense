       Intimations of Mortality    Death wanders like a preying bird within the confines of the Philippine General Hospital’s emergency room. It is 1 a.m., and the humid air of this midsummer night reeks of anguish. For even as evening deepens into a mourning echo, sadness is everywhere in this cramped, dingy ward.   In medical parlance they call it toxic. Patients pouring in faster than nurses can even keep track of them. But at least, the solemn mood of the room is punctuated only by the occasional sobbing of worried kins over ailing relatives.    I survey the scenes being played in front of me and I am overwhelmed by the amount of misery that apparently pervades the place.    In one obscure corner, a mother tries to calm down her wailing infant, as a doctor examines the child with weary eyes. In the sickbed next to them a nurse, with indifferent hands, attempts to feel signs of life from a barely-breathing old man by pressing her fingers against his wrist. An attendant carts away a woman in a wheelchair, while a man, presumably her husband, follows them. At the receiving desk, a nurse covers her face with her hands. She is falling asleep.    With no partitions to even distinguish between each patient's grief, the tragedy of disease becomes a communal experience in this ward. Simply, one’s sorrow can only be as bad as that of the person lying next to him. Gather all your wounded, the frail and the suffering, bring them here, this is sanctuary. But given the antiquated equipment and the dilapidated tiles, this sanctuary must be in trouble.   For one, people who cannot find a decent spot where they could rest opt to sleep on the curb outside the emergency room. Inside, ventilation is poor, with ceiling fans doing most of the work.    The inherent gloom in the emergency room reminds me of my own travails and the occasional depressions I suffer from. Unlike most people here tonight, I doubt if there are any reliable prescriptions available for my own afflictions. It even makes me envy these people a bit.    Distressingly, my life never seemed more finite than tonight, after I find myself in the company of those who are possibly facing the limits of their own mortality. I find it disturbing to think that someday I might just find myself lying in one of the beds here, my mortality imperiled, my pain exposed in full view of onlookers and passersby.    The alien scent of linen bedsheets and sterilized syringes pacifies the stench of expiring souls in this room. But somehow it still seems fake to me. Pain is a deeply personal struggle. But with patients closely lined up in rows to accommodate the overflow of people availing of this hospital’s free services, the ward’s set-up does not allow much room for suffering in private.    So I guess I’m still better off than the poorly attended patients of the PGH emergency room. At least I can keep my own torments to myself. If only for that then on a figurative and literal level, I can say that I wouldn’t be caught dead in this place.   (a mood piece written in May 1999, found it in my archives, and recalled a long-forgotten crush, hehe)

       Traces    (apologies to Rilke)    In lonely corners where strangers' footprints gather and vanish, I can almost see you smiling. In busy shops where people come and go with bags and empty pockets, I can almost see you; pensive and withdrawn. In bus stops lit up by weary lamps, I can almost see you; agitated, watching the minutes pass by waiting for a ride to take you to wherever it is you call home.  When morning breaks, you are the steam that escapes the edges of my coffee mug. When I leave the house, you are the gentle breeze that greets me outside; the kiss of morning heat and the pull of afternoon lethargy. You are my excuse to make it through the day, the anchor that keeps me grounded in the present.  Amid the chaos of airport terminals, the tranquility of coffee shop tables, the imposing height of skyscrapers and the humility of concrete pavements, I can almost hear some people whisper your name.  And sometimes, in the enchanting lyrics of a ballad, I can almost hear you sing to me in a language that only I understand. In the lines of a poem, I can almost see you taking the shape of every metaphor as if it were your hands that inked each word.  In empty seats on midnight transits, on the window seat of airplanes and taxicabs, you are a stranger dreaming of platforms and stop signs. I hidden alleys and crowded movie houses, I can almost see your profile in the dark. It is as if though you didn't want anyone to recognize you.  In every mirrorball, in every hospital bed, in every elevator, I can almost see you. In hushed conversations among kindred lips, in every feigned farewell, in every footstep along winding corridors, I look for you as a farmer dreams of rain.  I don't know your name, but you are somewhere out there. I have not seen you, but sometimes, I swear, I can almost touch you. At night I can feel your presence beside me in bed. It is as if though you had your hand on my chest and your lips on my ears.  Every waking moment is a struggle to remember what form you took in my every dream. I open my eyes to rumpled sheets and lonely pillows and it makes me hate every sunrise.  I look for clues to who you are among speeding cars, cobblestone roads, nameless walls and rooftops. I know you've been around but all the buildings refuse to reveal your name.  If I could, I would fly over the city and enter every door left open just so I could find you. But gravity burdens my search. And my feet can only take me so far. And my memory can only know so much of the city before I find myself in terra incognita. In the vastness of the land, I find that perhaps, I am just as lost as you are.

      Nobody will know about you.  I promise.  I will keep this secret if you keep your end of the bargain.  Make sure you don't tell anybody, especially the few friends that we have in common.  Don't tell them how I revealed myself to you only to be turned away.  They'll never believe it anyway.  Who would've thought --?  After all, a few of them have even turned to me, confessing how you drove them crazy with that supposedly harmless smile and disarming charm of yours.  You seem to know just how to break down other people's defenses even as you continually build those impenetrable walls around you.  But at this point, it would be best to keep silent.  Just take in the music from the stereo while you drive me home.  Drop me off at some point and speed off until you're out of sight.  And the next time we see each other, I will give you the option to look away if you see me.  You know how vulnerable I get when I see you walk in.  Nobody will know about you.  I promise.  Because the next time I see you I won't think about this burden at all.  I may not forget, but I can pretend.  You won't see me use that secret smile which you know I use only for you.  I won't ask you how you are and what is keeping you busy these days.  I will simply watch you move and follow your eyes as they rest on someone else's cheeks.  Should you decide to walk up to me, we won't talk about that letter, and if you have any further questions, don't bother asking for there will be no answers.  I will hide my pain, and no one will know your name, if you promise to stay friends with me after this.    I will carry this shame with dignity if you can carry a lie until the clock has moved forward and we can look back and laugh at this.  If you can pretend you're still comfortable with me then I will act as if nothing happened.  Which is not that difficult to do, since nothing really did.  Given that, this promise should be easy to keep, and I'm sure this mess I made won't make much of a lump once swept under the rug.  Nobody will know about you.  I promise.  You can wash your hands clean for absent sins, if you can honor my request for silence.  You won't have to say sorry and I won't be expecting an apology.  Mistakes like this happen to a lot of people all the time, right?    It was just my turn to play the fool.  My turn to jump off a cliff, and end up in the orthopedic ward.  It wasn't my first time, and I'm almost certain it won't be the last.  And if you can come up with a good excuse why you weren't there when I fell, then we can end up as good friends and you can turn to me when it's your turn to suffer a couple of broken metaphorical bones when you make that jump at the wrong time as well.  Nobody will know about you.  I promise.    If you can forgive the crazy things I did just to be near you.  If you can still think me normal if I admit I walked down your street just the other day.  If I admit that when I'm on the road I keep hoping to see you drive by and have developed a habit of looking out for license plates hoping it would be yours.  If you can be patient with all the messages I send you by "mistake" and all the occasional e-mails littered with my nonsense like spam.  If you can understand why sometimes I put you down, it is only because I think your ego needs to be brought down a notch for your own good.  Nobody will know about you.  I promise.    Maybe not until three years have passed and the calendar says it's January 2002.  Until we've searched for separate lights at the end of different tunnels or if the train has left; with me standing on this platform and a damned tune is stuck in my head.  Then and only then, will I finally admit, that 1999 was just a dream away and I watched you in your sleep and wished I could stretch out my arms to rest your head on my chest.  Not until I break our agreement and my lips betray my own silence and another soul finds out.  Then and until then, nobody will know except you and I.

       If The Eyes Don't Have It   Wednesday night.  It's right in the middle of an awful week of rushed errands and stressing deadlines, but I steal some time off to hang around a club in some out-of-the-way corner of the city to some sentimental music and good old beer.    But the booze and sounds are not my main motivation for coming here.  Against my better judgment I was convinced that it would be to my advantage to hang around the same place where chances are, I could bump into this guy I had taken a liking to.  I had to coax my friend Princess to go with me since we'd earlier agreed we'd just have coffee someplace else and bum around (and maybe watch cute guys pass by).  But two hours after going here, Princess and I are sitting on the pavement and she was breaking some bad news to me.    Princess tells me that with a simple, yet voluminous gesture, the guy made it clear that he wasn't interested in me.  Of course, the guy is no complete stranger.  In fact, we work together.  In fact, here in this bar, we're in the same table. In fact, it was a common friend who even told me I should be here so I could be with this guy.    I had gone to the bathroom and as I made my way back to our table, I said hi to people I knew along the way and got caught up in conversations.  In a span of no more than five minutes, the friend who said I should be here had tried to sit the guy next to my chair.  Princess says the guy contemptuously rolled his eyes and went back to chitchat with our other friends.  Apparently annoyed, Princess tells me; of what, she wasn't sure.  I guess I'm just too transparent sometimes.  My presence was a giveaway and the fact that most of the people in our table knew that I liked him was probably an unsavory context in which the gesture was made.  But knowingly or otherwise, the guy made the gesture right in front of someone I trust.  When I got back to the table, Princess asked me to go out with her and that's how we ended up sitting on the pavement talking about this.    As Princes recounts the incident that happened while I was gone, I felt somehow relieved.  When words fail you, your eyes won't, even if you want them to.  For a writer who has trouble with words, sometimes signs are all I have to hang on to.   And that sign was as categorical as you could get, I guess.  But I've been humbled far too many times to take this one sitting down.  Without blinking an eye I asked Princess to take off with me and go somewhere else.  With as much grace as I could, I excused myself from our friends and was out of there no sooner than I had resolved that I would never hang around anywhere just to get someone to notice me.  And by leaving I hoped I had made that clear.  Or you could say I was just chicken shit as usual.    In any case, what Princess told me was no shock.  This was the same guy I had asked to go out on a movie with me.  The same guy who tells me, all in one breath that he can't go to a movie with me because he's busy, he has a meeting and that he has no money. (Thought balloon:  One lousy excuse is good enough for me, dude.)  So despite her worry, I tell Princess that I'm okay and that I'll be fine.  It's nothing that a good lay won't cure in a day or two.  And I laugh.  But what I said couldn't have been farther from the truth.  People always say that the eyes have it.  That it only takes one look, and you can understand everything you need to understand about another person.  Don't worry about walls.  Your eyes will see through them.  Stop looking for the signs.  The eyes will give them.  Spare your words.  The eyes will tell all. Just look for that look, and you'll do fine.  For months I had given him the eye.  I looked at him in a way I didn't look at other people.  I had this longing, inviting look in my eye every time he walked through the door.  I watched him walk, I followed his every step with my eyes; I stared at him while he sat in front of me.  My eyes had all the answers to whatever questions might have crossed his mind.  I guess I should have known better, since his eyes certainly never gave any indication that they were looking in the same direction my own pair was.  And that's really sad, because you can bullshit your way into someone's pants with catchy lines, or you can let your hands do the talking.  But a person's eyes -- they're something else.  Which makes me think: when we fall for someone, how do we know we haven't lost sight of the things that really matter?  I began to think that maybe I got so wrapped up in my own feelings that somehow, I had become blinded.  My eyes wanted to see what wasn't there, all the time ignoring how the other person felt, which was nothing.  So out the window my self-respect flew that night at the club.  All things considered in hindsight, it was a long time coming. But of course, nobody breaks more bones than those who refuse to see.  So with a few kind words brought about by a most unkind gesture, I gathered my wits about me and concluded that it is time to open my eyes and move on.  From that night on, there were to be no more yearning and pining.    The following morning I went back to work and while I did not see him, I went on with my business as if the revelations of the previous night had had no effect on me.  Which is not to say that I was in denial.  Far from it.  When the pain of rejection is too much to handle you can lash out in anger, be indifferent or proceed with a new attitude.  I choose to take a different tack; after all I will have to deal with him again soon since he's just a few doors down the hall.  My new attitude consists of going about the way I treat him.  But this time, there will be no more clouds obfuscating my view, and no more dreamy looks thrown his way.    And it feels good to not get bogged down by the pettiness of pain.  When things are clear and you don't have to keep second-guessing and wondering, you get a sense of clarity about why you don't end up with someone you like.  I can see clearly now, and that's what really matters.  I can look up and know that the clouds are not in my eyes anymore.  Surely that means things can only get better.

      Thank You (an open letter for friends)  Sometimes I get to thinking - I don't say "thank you" often enough.  I have to apologize for that.  Maybe I am selfish without being aware of it.  Thankfully, with age comes a certain level of self-awareness and I am more aware now than I was perhaps not later than just a year ago.    And what a year it has been indeed.  From my tempestuous departure from a horrible job to my appendectomy to my introduction to my newfound political family, the proverbial roller coaster ride I call my life has been through some fantastic new heights, and to some devastating lows in the past year.  A lot of times I have doubted myself, doubted others, kept myself wrapped up in self-pity and unnecessary recriminations, failed to seize initiatives or simply didn't care enough to reach out.  I'm not about to make a promise that I will stop doing those things, but admitting my weaknesses is perhaps one tangible proof I'm headed for maturity now that I've just hit 26.  Either that or I am just in the  denoumént  of a possible quarter-life crisis.  Often I forget to say thank you to a kind gesture or some favor done to me ( specifically, my hospitalization last year! ).  But please keep in mind that even though I am not good with details, I never forget how people made me feel.  It's just that a lot of times I feel like I'm living my life for someone else, like I am always putting someone else's interests before my own, or putting on a show for someone else's eyes - which you would probably agree with if you know enough about me and the kind of life I live.  Sometimes I feel like the world owes me a favor and refuse to accept it when things do not go my way.  But during my selfish fits, I forget that the world does not revolve around me, and maybe -- just maybe -- I should stop thinking about what is due me, but just try to give out more.    I am not a very expressive person.  I often find it difficult to express how I really feel, because I'm afraid of being vulnerable and being seen as weak.  But I guess that's the point.  When the chips are down and when I am at my lowest of lows, that's precisely the moment I can see clearly just who I can rely on.  When I am hurting or just plain dismissive of the world around me, it's nice to know there are still people out there who will still have me as a friend anyway despite my flaws.  When my sense of self-worth is in question, when I can't say what I want to say right there and then, it's nice to know there are people with whom I can be with without having to be anything except myself.  And when I get to thinking about how incomplete my sense of self is, it's nice to just have people who will not mind being around me even if I don't say a word. It's wonderful to know that my friends are easy to find, even when I am being difficult.  So thank you for putting up with me even if I choose to withdraw inside myself.  Thank you for not judging me as a contemptuous asshole, which is what I really am.  Thank you for the encouragement for all those times when there were clouds in my coffee.  Thank you for understanding my temperament and making me realize that my happiness does not have to depend on any other person.  Thank you because tomorrow when I wake up to more challenges, more struggles and yes, even more heartaches, you'll still be there.  Thank you for your patience with my Zen mush and my compound sentences.    Thank you for being a friend.  Best, Vince :)

       Joyride  October 10, 2003  There is so much of the world to see.  But I have known no place aside from the labyrinthine roads of Manila.  I know very well the scent of her soot, the color of the dirt on her face, the stench of her mouth and the faked warmth of her embrace.  Sometimes I wish people could fly, or I were a mutant who could teleport just so I can see Paris in summer or New York in autumn.  I suck on my cigarette, cock my head up to exhaust the fume and I see an airplane taking off at night and long to take that last flight out of Manila and never come back.  Sometimes I imagine myself walking down a busy street in New York.  I am lost in a sea of people who are taller than me, people with red, orange, blonde, black or brown hair, and I am suddenly aware of my skin color, my eyes, and my race.  Would it make me distinct or just more self-conscious?  But I have to admit, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Sometimes, I imagine settling down in some place like Norway, in those times when I hate the sun and wish I didn’t have to be anywhere near the equator.  Or maybe live in the wilderness of Alaska in search of the Northern Lights and an epiphany or two.  Any place where it’s freezing cold and I can use heaters and don’t have to rely on human warmth to keep me from getting numb.  Or maybe in some wet, damp city like Seattle or Vancouver or London where the brooding, intense, introverted part of me can fit in perfectly with the constant downpours.    But If I do leave, will I find what I am looking for?  Will I land a job that engages my mind like a brilliantly laid out puzzle? Or will I end up washing dishes instead in some rundown fast food joint?  Will I fall madly in love with a handsome French poet or end up bed hopping with the same old shit heads that abound in this city?  Will I hone my words and turn them into a bestseller? Or will I end up wasted and wounded; an unpublished upstart who thinks the world owes him for putting down his words into paper? Will I fit in or will I just be a casualty of bigotry?  There is too much fear in me to step beyond the comfort of my comfort zone to risk planting new roots somewhere else.    Manila is my “context”, and everything in it – friends, family, work – are the factors that intersect and relate to help define, expand or limit my sense of self, and my ability to exercise my personal freedom.  What happens when I take myself out of that “context”, and place myself in a new environment? Will I be free enough to see for myself who I can be?    People I know who have gone abroad are almost invariably vocal about their desire to come back home.  The reason they left were primarily economic in nature, and after realizing dreams aren’t easier to chase anywhere else, they begin to long for the madness of the home country.  But my motivation is equal parts emotional and economic.  I do long to find a job that pays big, considering I feel undervalued in a market where I am dispensable and there’s probably a million other people who can replace me.  But part of me wanting to get the hell out of here has also to do with a sense of helplessness derived from not being able to fully realize my potential as a human being.  There is an untapped potential in me that isn’t merely hindered by economic hardships, but also from a basic sense of incompleteness and bondage.  Bondage to all the things that keep me grounded.  Which makes me wonder: is there really freedom in leaving?  I’m really not in a position to say.  But this I know: more and more often nowadays I look around me and I tell myself that this cannot be the future.  There has got to be more to life than hacking speeches for a politician, puking my guts out on Friday night binges at some club, overdosing my stomach with caffeine on weekday nights and fantasizing about guys whose names I couldn’t screw the guts to ask.    Maybe, just maybe, if I leave this all behind I would learn to appreciate what I have now only when I realize it’s all gone.  And from there I can be free to build up from scratch and assumingly make fewer mistakes.  Maybe I just take the phrase “burning bridges” too seriously.  But the thought of starting anew someplace else where nobody knows you and where you come from has the word “exciting” written all over it and it does make me think.    It makes me think about my place in this world, in the over-all scheme of things.  When I feel like I don’t belong or like I should be someplace else instead of where I am, I often think of another city.  Any city aside from Manila and I feel like I’m more at home.  Some call it wanderlust. I call it soul-searching.  Where do I have to go to be happy?  But don’t get me wrong.  I do enjoy the company of friends.  I love my family.  I like my job.  But it’s me I’m having difficulty dealing with.  My context unsettles me with its bland familiarity.  I am dissatisfied with the routine I have settled into.  There is no incentive before me that would make me kick myself in the butt.  I am not challenged.  And I take this to mean that a radical shift in the way I look at the word is in order, and I can only do this by heading off into the unknown, by literally exploring the world and settling down somewhere else.  If life is indeed a road, I feel like I’m going down a highway driven by inertia, not by a clear desire to head somewhere.  Now I am at a fork, and it’s time to put on the brakes, look both ways and see what’s in store for me down the other road.  It could be a dead-end, but as they say, every minute spent living is another chance to turn one’s self around.  I realize that just as in anything else, it’s not about the destination as much as it is about the journey. It doesn’t really matter where you’re going as long as you enjoy the ride.  And if putting some fun back into driving means putting on a pair of wings and flying, then surely the impossible doesn’t have to seem ridiculous.  So maybe it isn’t about the “where” as much as it is about the “how”.  I can go any place if I really want to but I guess that still wouldn’t make me happy.  But I’ll die if I don’t at least try.

       Thinking Too Much  October 26, 2003  It’s been five days and counting, and I’m still stumped.  I can’t seem to put anything down into paper.  I guess it’s because there’s really not much to be said about people that do not mean much to me anymore.  Maybe if I’d been a little bit quicker to capture the moment I might have been able to come up with something about a week ago when I was angry.  I was angry because I couldn’t help keep asking myself why I gave a damn about where  he  was and who  he  was with and what  he  was doing.  I was angry because I felt inadequate and unsure and unworthy every time I didn’t know where  he  was and who  he  was with and what  he  was doing.  I was angry because thinking made me angry and anger made me think even more.  The more I thought about it the more I thought less of what I felt and just dwelt on what I thought.  And all the thinking I did made me as dizzy as what I just said, and I ended up saying nothing because I thought it was just better to shut up and think.  But I just got angrier.  And I was angry because at the same time that I thought about  him , I knew I didn’t want  him .  I was angry because all I could do was think when I should have just stood still and let myself go through the motions without having to analyze things too much.  And the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I did not deserve such self-inflicted nuisances, and that I shouldn’t spend too much time for someone who doesn’t even have the time of day for me.  I just got more angry when I thought about how life seems to move around in circles and every choice, every turn we take is just some obfuscated sign that leads us back down to some place we already know and have been in before.  And mentally, this is where I am right now.  I’m back at one, and it isn’t a good place to be, where all I can do is think and not much else.  But literally this is where I am: a coffee shop, al fresco, on a Saturday evening, and I am engaging a very cute guy in an otherwise mundane conversation about how devastated we were with the last twenty pages of A Farewell to Arms and how Hemingway makes me want to put out a revolver and shoot myself in the head.  The guy had dropped in on my friend and I while we were having coffee, after he saw us having coffee while he was walking by the place.  My friend introduced us and he had some chips.  In my mind I thought  nada  about  nada  and  nada  when you  nada  with a  nada  and  nada  into  nada , which is  nada  until it is  nada .  And then he helped himself to some more chips.  And I just kept thinking of  nada .  Then he saw my copy of A Moveable Feast and that’s how we started talking, and talking about Hemingway.      I told him about how I thought of bringing my copy of A Moveable Feast to this coffee shop because I thought I would be doing some reading waiting for my friend, which I didn’t.  I was the one who got there late.  Anyway, I thought it was impolite to tell him the truth:  that I just wanted to be pretentious at that particular moment because of how intellectual it looked to be reading about a coffee shop in Paris in a coffee shop in Manila while thinking about the cobblestone roads of a city I’ve never even seen.  And he told me how he’d like to borrow the book once I’ve finished it.  Then I told him it was okay to borrow it right there and then because I have a long list of books I haven’t gotten around to reading anyway.  I was more elaborate about how I bought the copy at a discounted price but never got around to sitting down and reading the book because I can’t pronounce the French words right when I read them inside my head.  It bugs me that I can’t read right words like  Café St. Michel  or  Palace du Precepace  or some other shit like that.    So he thanked me and after a while he left to go someplace else where he had a meeting.  I followed him with my eyes as he walked away.  Then I got to think about how cute he looked and how warm and strong and massive he would feel if I wrapped my arms around him.    But then I got to think how he’s probably straight and thinking about somebody else while I thought about him.  I thought how he’s probably pining away for somebody else and nobody’s doing the same to me, and how pathetic that makes me.  Then I thought how that could be nothing new and how that has always been the case with me.  So I thought it was okay to think about him since I’m used to being on the receiving end of nothing remotely mutual.  And it made me angry because that shouldn’t be the point when you like someone.  But I thought about how I can’t help it if that was the way I felt.  Then I realized my thoughts were nothing and what I was thinking is nothing, and Hemingway is right about nada being nada and how one shouldn’t try so hard to put down words into paper when there is no bottom-line and the only word I can think of while I thought about him is nada.  And then I thought I should probably stop thinking since he’s going to give me back my book once he’s through with it.  Then I would run out of things to talk to him about, and all I’ll be left with are my thoughts and I would only start thinking again about things and things that don’t exist.  Then I realized that no matter how bad it looked, it was good.  Thinking about this cute guy didn’t remind me of the other guy who doesn’t mean much to me anymore.  All the while I thought about him and Hemingway, and I forgot about where the other guy was and who he was with and what he was doing.  Then I realized thinking didn’t make me angry anymore, so it must be okay to do even more thinking.  After my coffee refill, I got to think.  Maybe getting stuck back at one isn’t so bad after all.  There is a certain comfort in cycles, and the point is to learn from your mistakes.  So this is where I am.  A place where, to be honest, there’s still a little bit of anger.  A place where all I can do is think and not much else.  But if only for the sake of that cute guy, maybe I should start thinking my way out of this place.

      Giving Up  Who am I kidding?  You're never out of mind when  you're out of sight.  When you're near I want to  put my arms around your waist and pull you  close.  This morning at half-light I dreamed I  was kissing you.  I pretend I don't care when people put you down.   But the truth is I'm mad because I still see the  good out of all the bad I hear about you.  And it gets worse when I think about the futility  of it all and the absurdity of my obsession.   It's utterly naive of me to think a couple of  dates can take you off my mind when the mind is a  dangerous thing when your imagination runs wild.  Usher said you got it bad on at least two  occasions:  when you're out with someone but you  keep on thinking about somebody else; and when  you’re stuck in the house and you don’t want to  have fun because you’re thinking about someone  else.  I have it worse.  I think of ways not to  think of you but the irony is that I need your  presence to remind me so.  Time and again, the insistence of possibilities  draws me back to second-guessing the wisdom of my  decisions.  But the plain facts speak louder than  even the limits of my pride allow me to accept  them.  Yet acknowledging my emotions for what they  really are should not be taken as a cue to raise  the white flag anytime soon.    And that is the wisest yet saddest part.  It’s  not enough to know how you feel, when how you  feel cannot change the way things are.  There are  some things you just never say out loud when  walls are all you have left to talk to.

       A Peregrine in the Island of Tenderness   (written back in 2002)  Tonight I find myself walking the rugged length of the Academic Oval, alone with my thoughts; alone with the world and the forlorn streets lit up by almost-dying lamps. It is still a few hours before the blanket of this dark night gives way to the saffron kiss of dawn. Before the city is filled again with the sight and banter of millions of other lonely souls finding their way through her avenues and alleys. So I walk, consuming a pack of poison whose fumes travel the length of my lips to my lungs in silent but deadly fashion.  And as my feet conquers every inch of this road, I gather myself around the traces of our first meeting -- that brief moment of awkward introductions, then the comforting assurance of exchanged smiles and the free-flowing of words that followed between us. Before the night was over, I found myself vulnerable, yet willingly so, to your charms. And nobody knew it but me.  I took home what I could of you -- a hodgepodge of images: the sordid beauty of a dying sun in your eyes, the fine length of your arms, the gentle, heavy way you walked, your enchanting smile that hides a secret pain, and the inebriating wine of your laughter. I remember the way our minds seemed to meet at every turn, from the way we looked at the world around us, to religion, to the places we've both seen, to the more mundane details of favorite TV shows, books and music. I knew at that moment that when I wake up, you would linger in the air, and the scent of your presence would be in my coffee mug.  Every image, every memory I have of you is a hand peeling away the layers of this eggshell-crusted heart.  Even though I would later find out that breaking open the carapace that shields your elusive heart would prove to be a prayer for rain in the middle of May. As Sisyphian as deciding which of your messages should stay in my inbox and which ones should not. I miss the sound of your messages coming in while I'm busy at work.  Tonight however, we are both silent; apart under the same clouds concealing the same sun. I wonder: are you out there painting the town in shades of your private joys and pains? Are you deep in slumber dreaming of the one who has kept you just beyond my reach? I finish half the pack of my cigarettes, filling my lungs with even more poison, and an inexplicable anger takes over me. For as I am consumed by thoughts of you, I long to remember the feeling of being young, unfettered and unscathed by the jaded speed of this world.  But that feeling is long gone, replaced by a longing to find ways to coax you out of your reticence; by a deep wanting to feast on your lips and the salt of your skin. Wondering if I could cup your cheeks and breathe the warmth of your own breath.  The sublime tranquility of this night offers no comfort. Only more questions. And a road that I find is getting shorter. Giving up, my mind instead recounts fables I have heard before.  The story is told of a peregrine, a man wandering the world waiting for that moment when lightning would strike and kill him so that his misery can be put to an end. And another story is told about a man named Roberto, shipwrecked on a deserted ship called the Daphne. Isolated and with no means to leave the ship nor swim to a nearby shore, he reconstructs memories of Casale, a city in which he had fought as a soldier and fell in love.   "He laid out a Casale of his own passion, transforming alleys, fountains, squares into the River of Inclination, the Lake of Indifference, or the Sea of Hostility: he made the wounded city into the land of his personal unsated Tenderness; an Island of his solitude."*(*from Umberto Eco's The Island of the Day Before)   But in my mind the distinction between the two stories are blurred. At once I am the peregrine, as well as the shipwrecked man. Lost in her bowels with nowhere in particular to go, this city has become the Casale of my own passion, the island of my tenderness. The streets of this university have become the Avenues of Silence; the stars above, a Banquet of Despair. The feelings I have for you is my Sea of Emotions and the words that I will never tell you is the lightning waiting for me at the end of this road.  I am a peregrine indeed, travelling from one heartache to another in a cycle of self-denial and self-deprecation. You don't know it, but you are only the latest name in a list of those I've loved only in my mind. If I could heed Isak Dinesen's words I would speak like rain. The words would come and you would know why I write about you here. My words would be a gentle storm and your compassion, acceptance and even reciprocation would be the ship that saves me from this island. But there are a million words that cannot find their way out of my lips. And there are rules I have always been afraid to break. So I choose the easy way out and keep shut.  It is a sad decision that dawns on me as day makes its way to this hemisphere. Exhausted, I consume the last of my cigarettes and head home. The streets are empty; a vacuum of dust and insensitive asphalt. The night sky stands still and mourns. And here I am; alone with my thoughts, alone on this island. With no ride in sight, sleep will have to wait.

       The 25th Hour   The long and winding road to Laoag is fraught with questions and uncertain intentions.  I do not know what I am getting myself into but I take a deep breath, and get on the bus anyway.  It leaves at midnight, will snake its way along the unfamiliar stretch of highway up north and lead me to a young man I barely know.  Turn the clock twenty four hours forward and I am back to where I was before.  More positive than ever with a stupid smile stuck on my face.    What happened in between?  Obviously it was something good.  Actually, it was fantastic.  And I don’t mean the physical side of it.  Some people think I dropped everything just to get my rocks off.  But that wasn’t it.  People who know me, the ones who  really  know me, said it best: it’s not even about the guy anymore.  “This decision is all about you.”  Eileen added, “No one deserves to be happy now more than you.”  And I guess she’s right.  Living a life is no crime.  Letting an opportunity slip by is an option for losers.  I’ve been called a loser before, and I’m tired of it.  It was an unkind accusation, an arrogant judgment but I allowed myself to believe in it.  Thus, last Saturday was partly about proving that I can take a chance on life.  Not for anybody else’s sake but for my own.  That’s what I got out of PJ.  That and the fact that he’s a wonderful guy who deserves the very same things I so fervently seek.  After dinner we sat outside his house and started talking.  When he took me in his arms and kissed me, I felt a world inside of me open.  It was a world inhabited by hope and acceptance.  For the first time in a while, I felt it was okay to let myself be vulnerable again.    I told PJ I like him.  I told PJ I wanted him.  But I told him we should just take the moment as it comes.  I opened up, unsure of how he’d respond.  I expressed how I felt and yet I kept my expectations grounded.  His response was beautiful.  To be sure, he is not without his own issues.  I can understand his pain, although I cannot assume to know how it feels, nor can I assure him I will solve his problems for him.  That’s not what I came to Ilocos Norte for.  I came to PJ to see if we can have a connection, and I left PJ with the assurance that at the very least he’s found a genuine friend.  He’s walking wounded, but there’s a light-hearted beauty that shines through even when he claims he’s feeling shitty.  And I love the form of his mass, the categoricalness of his bones, the tenderness of his arms, and his weight pressing against me.  I like PJ.  It’s not difficult for me to see myself falling for him.  He’s funny, he’s smart, he inspires me, and there are sparks.    So this is the 25th Hour:  after spending a day with PJ, I find myself opening up even more.  I am more courageous and willing to gamble.  Risk isn’t such a bad thing after all.    Spike Lee asked whether you could change your whole life in a day in the movie from which I got this title.  I used to chaff at that question.  It’s so ridiculous, really.  Maybe you can turn yourself around in a month or two, or more probably in a few years.  But in a day?  Come on.  But last Saturday was pivotal in that I learned that most important of all, I should learn to balance between distancing myself from how I feel and look at it objectively on the one hand, and giving in with total abandon on the other.  PJ gave me the chance to do both.  In return, I’ve opened the door, and he can feel free to explore my heart anytime he wants.  If he gets tired of me, because he says we all get tired of people eventually, then at least we tried.    I guess to make myself clear – I just want to say that PJ is an open-ended question.  Someone asked me if he’s my boyfriend and I tell her flatly, that no, he is not.  I don’t want to impose any more expectations on him.  I don’t even want to crowd him.  I respect his space, his freedom, and his context.    But at the end of the day, I want to be the first to tell him that whatever he’s gone through, and if he’s been dealt a bad set of cards, it’s still okay because I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.  If it doesn’t work, then I’m thankful because I was at least given a chance to say how I felt.  So all in all, last Saturday was all about shattering great expectations.  But for now, I’m just watching the clock tick by, basking in and wishing that the 25th hour lasts a little longer.

       adulthood   There must be a word for this, when time has moved on and the 25th hour is over, yet you feel at ease for the good it has done to you.  When you know happiness is a choice, and it is only the path to it that you have to figure out.  When you know that letting go isn't always goodbye.  There must be a word for this, when you can look yourself in the mirror and still say "you're worth it".  When you realize that you are a gem, and if you are not worth the wooing then as longfellow said, then you are not worth the winning.  When even 'winning' loses its contrived definition and become a process and not an end goal.  There must be a word for this, when after the long kiss goodnight you can actually look forward to tomorrow and not hate yourself for waking up alone in bed.  When your bed becomes an affirmation of individuality, not a prison where you are supposed to languish in longing and wanting.  There must be a word for this, when you can live with your choices and regret fades from your dictionary like a badly conceived term.  When you realize words are not all that you have, because you have your heart, and you have your mind -- and they're working in unison instead of against each other.  There must be a word for this when you can forgive without being asked for it, when you can channel your anger into something positive and be able to rise above the pettiness of self-doubt.  There must be a word for this, when your heart gets broken and you can still manage a smile.  When you can pick up the pieces without resentment for playing the fool.  When it doesn't even matter how many times you play the fool, because you get through it a better man, a better person reaching out again and again until you can get it right.  There must be a word for this, when you can see the light and it doesn't come after the dark but coexists as they should, in harmony, with one unable to survive without the other.  When you can stand in the light with no fear to go back into the dark, if need be.  There must be a word for this, when it's in the tip of your tongue and you can't just say it out loud but still feel good inside.    There must be a word for this, when in spite of all the cow dung you're dealt with, you can dust it off and go on.   There must be a word for this. No doubt about it.

       The Peregrine   Two questions I hate to be asked: “Who are you?” and “Are you happy?”. They're both nebulous and irrelevant.   People see me through different lenses, as I suit their own lives. A son, a brother, a suitor, a friend, a confidant, an antagonist, an adviser, an employee, a colleague, an acquaintance, an ex-classmate, an orgmate, a spurned lover, etc.   But stripped of all conceptions about my identity that are predicated on the relationships that I have formed, lost and found again, what becomes of this man? In all honesty, I can't tell you, and neither should I try. There's more to a person than what you can possibly box in 500 words or less. All I know is that I'm a man who is trying.   I'm a man who is trying to be a better presence in other people's lives. A man who earns a decent living in a job that tries to make life a little better for my fellow human beings. I'm a cadre, an activist, an agitator with my words and a proud moderate at heart.   I'm a man who is trying to be a more open partner. Step by step, slowly yet steady. I'm tearing down the walls in my own sweet time, under my own terms. I'm unraveling the mystery I've spent some time building up, as I fumble my way towards ecstasy. (thanks for finding the right words, Sarah)   I'm a man who is trying to put on the brakes, even though I'm fully aware that the best way to approach life is to approach it with reckless abandon, damn all consequences. I'm a trainwreck waiting to happen on the way to nowhere (thanks for the quote, Chantal)   I'm a man who is trying to keep hoping even if I have every reason not to do so. I believe in the inherent goodness of people, even though people sometimes let you down, or hurt you, or turn their back on you. People are people and I'm just going on (thank you Simone, Kim and Jonny).   I'm a man who is trying to keep the faith, even though I remember I was fifteen when I last prayed. I'm a man who believes that there's more to existence than this plane of being, but that God is not best articulated by organized religion, and that the bottom-line of our soul is the consistency of the goodness we show and express towards other people. I believe we do not get more than what we give.   I'm a man who is trying to stay grounded, yet never lose sight of stars. I’m a man who swings from one extreme to another, with a full range of emotions in between. I’m a man who is trying to tone down my intensity, but is helpless against the power of my passions.   I'm a man who fell, but got up again. A man who wants to fall, for the right reason, for the right person.  A man who isn’t afraid to fail, not anymore.  A man who knows his worth, even as he tries to draw the line where enough can be said to be enough.  I'm a man who just recently realized he is capable of forgiveness even if it hasn't been asked for.  I'm a man with no bitterness.

      In lonely corners where strangers' footprints gather and vanish, I can almost see you smiling. In busy shops where people come and go with bags and empty pockets, I can almost see you; pensive and withdrawn. In bus stops lit up by weary lamps, I can almost see you; agitated, watching the minutes pass by waiting for a ride to take  you to wherever it is you call home.   When morning breaks, you are the steam that escapes the edges of my coffee mug. When I leave the house, you are the gentle breeze that greets me outside; the kiss of morning heat and the pull of afternoon lethargy. You are my excuse to make it through the day, the anchor that keeps me grounded in the present.   Amid the chaos of airport terminals, the tranquility of coffee shop tables, the imposing height of skyscrapers and the humility of concrete pavements, I can almost hear some people whisper your name.   And sometimes, in the enchanting lyrics of a ballad, I can almost hear you sing to me in a language that only I understand. In the lines of a poem, I can almost see you taking the shape of every metaphor as if it were your hands that inked each word.   In empty seats on midnight transits, on the window seat of airplanes and taxicabs, you are a stranger dreaming of platforms and stop signs. In hidden alleys and crowded movie houses, I can almost see your profile in the dark. It is as if though you didn't want anyone to recognize you.   In every mirrorball, in every hospital bed, in every elevator, I can almost see you. In hushed conversations among kindred lips, in every  feigned farewell, in every footstep along winding corridors, I look for you as a farmer dreams of rain.   I don't know your name, but you are somewhere out there. I have not seen you, but sometimes, I swear, I can almost touch you. At night I can  feel your presence beside me in bed. It is as if though you had your hand on my chest and your lips on my ears.   Every waking moment is a struggle to remember what form you took in my every dream. I open my eyes to rumpled sheets and lonely pillows and it makes me hate every sunrise.   I look for clues to who you are among speeding cars, cobblestone roads, nameless walls and rooftops. I know you've been around but all the buildings refuse to reveal your name.   If I could, I would fly over the city and enter every door left open just so I could find you. But gravity burdens my search. And my feet can only take me so far. And my memory can only know so much of the city before I find myself in terra incognita. In the vastness of the land, I find that perhaps, I am just as lost as you are.

      August 7, 2004  Where does one go in order to find love? Everybody keeps saying you don’t go looking for it. It finds you. But if this is true, and everybody believed in it, won’t we all end up waiting? So who’s going to do the searching?  I sought it out because I believed love is always in need of a little push. In a world where the “meet market” is crowded with pretenders and shallow assholes, I wanted to find that tiny little corner where I could feel safe and secure. I didn’t know who or what to look for, because I always said that all you need are sparks, and that you shouldn’t judge someone based on where they’ve been or what they’ve done. Loving someone means dealing with the package as it comes, no questions asked.  Then I realized that I was exacting the highest standard of all. For how many among us can truly say that we can love someone without making some sort of judgment? How unconditional can we get in giving our love, except for that kind of love which is reserved for our mothers and fathers?  I keep thinking about it. Is my approach just too idealistic? Am I too intense? Am I too sentimental? Am I lacking in social grace, tact, and honesty? Or am I just plain ugly? Are my walls really that impenetrable?  As a tired and trite song goes, if one finds the place, how does one recognize the face? For far too many times I got it wrong:   It’s not the Collegian. It’s not the young man who sleeps beside me on weekends while we wait for bleeding drafts to come in.  It’s not in my long-lost friend Karla’s pool. It’s not the sweet, funny guy who kept me on the phone for hours.  It’s not the Bistro. It’s not in the eyes of a young turk whom everybody wants but can never have.  It’s not in a city half a thousand miles away. It’s not the stranger in tight shirts with long hair fascinated with ashtrays and funeral parlors.  It’s not in Kit’s party. It’s not the guy whose name I kept calling out as they dragged me, wasted and wounded, off the street and into a couch.   It’s never in any place near where I am. It’s never the guy I almost thought it was. It makes me think whether this is karma working its way to me. Am I paying for some other mistake I made in some other lifetime? Surely, the pain I have caused other guys can not amount to the pain I’ve been dealt. That isn’t being insensitive, just a statement of a highly unimpeachable fact.  I’m getting less than I’m giving, and it sucks. I want to put a stop to it. It’s sad, on the other hand, because I have so much more to give and no one’s taking it. I’m ready and able and willing and no one seems to notice, and no one cares. So why should I?  I’m down with this second-hand emotion, this sweet, but old-fashioned notion. I’m tired of another “used to be”.  Maybe it’s time to stop believing love means having to make so much sacrifices. Love isn’t about playing the role of the martyr. It’s not about chasing after anyone. Maybe it’s time to stop thinking love has to hurt to feel good, that love is best understood when it is out there for everyone else to see. Maybe it’s time to stop believing wearing your heart on your sleeve is the only way to go. Maybe it’s time to stop believing love finds you because you’re not afraid of showing how hurt you are.  Or maybe I’m wrong. There’s nothing wrong with me nor in the way I look at love. It’s just those guys that didn’t work out right. There’s no need to blame love.  Maybe it’s just time to focus on me instead. Not as someone else sees me, but as I really am. It’s time to find empowerment in solitude, not to be cowed by its overwhelming power. After all we’re all still alone at the end of the day. So I guess I should settle with the fact that I’m just me, nothing more, nothing less. I’m not the perfect someone. I might not even be The One for anybody, but I am Someone, with or without someone else.

      Even though I depend on words for a living, Sarah McLachlan inked the words to my life.  She accuses me of building a mystery and I cry 'guilty as charged'.  She said my love is better than ice cream, and I think of what flavor best describes me (ampalaya?). She croons about messing up and I imagine drowning in a bathtub for all my own foul-ups.  I used to think words are all I have and so I relied on them to speak in my behalf until I learned words were just weaker weapons than actions.   That you can string together the most elaborate phrases yet never quite capture the beauty or the sadness of a moment until you find yourself in that moment and you choose to seize or leave it.  Sarah talks about the violence of existing only for one person and I weave dreams about failed loves, weep for unrealized pursuits and refuse to let go. She offers me advice to grieve in my condition for not having the strength to say "I need you", and I am immediately thinking of a calm shore besieged by a storm on the horizon.  And when someone asks me how I am doing in the romance department, I just smile weakly, and tell them "I'm still fumbling my way towards ecstasy."  But when she sings about Adia, I realize that's where the buck stops. :)
