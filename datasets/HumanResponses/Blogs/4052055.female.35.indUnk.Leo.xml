						   The summer semester is officially over - took my final yesterday... we'll see how that goes.&nbsp; BTW - I got a call from Jimmy D the other day.&nbsp; He wants to email me this letter.&nbsp; I'm curious, but I'm also willing to bet I know exactly what's in it.&nbsp;   Just checked my grades - 100% on my Algebra final!&nbsp; Yea for me.  &nbsp;Nise & I will be going to the Stitch &amp; Bitch at Aalim Saturday - I REALLY need to get to work on my costume - I don't want to bring just the pieces!&nbsp; I also need to finish her bra.&nbsp; I'm hoping I can get some help with hemming my chiffon panel skirt.&nbsp; Wish me luck.  &nbsp;- Kirvi

						    Everyone says that&nbsp;keeping a&nbsp;journal is good for mental health, good for the soul.&nbsp; Of course, I've never been much into what anyone else says (see profile, and a dictionary for the meaning of "introvert" if necessary.)&nbsp; Studying for my Algebra final this week - I have to take it by tomorrow if I want the extra credit points.&nbsp; Of course, I had to take tard-math due to my having enjoyed the 80's far to much.&nbsp; That and a 12 on the math portion of my SAT's.&nbsp; Think about that for a moment.&nbsp; Allow it to really soak in.&nbsp; 12, baby.&nbsp; Big 12.    &nbsp;  After the total blow-out of a vacation I just had - wait, that could be misconstrued in this context.&nbsp; Strike "Blow-out," insert one of the following - "annihilation"&nbsp; "destruction on a global scale"&nbsp; "seventh outer ring of Hell".&nbsp; Ok, better.&nbsp; Now that I'm back, I can't believe I didn't buy any of the cowrie shell belts or beaded/sequinned wrap skirts I saw.&nbsp; I really hate to spend money, and I was pretty occupied with fighting that part of my personality that wanted to act like the child of rich, divorced parents - "you guys got me into this shithole - now compensate me materially for my anguish."&nbsp; So I didn't really buy anything much.&nbsp; Tommy did get me this beautiful carved statue, it's a man & a woman, very minimalist.&nbsp; And I got my tattoo finally.&nbsp; I say finally, like I'm the one who's been wanting one.&nbsp; Oh, I kicked the idea around, but T really wanted one, and he really wanted me to have one too.&nbsp; So I got mine first.&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/morrigandances/dragons.jpg &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Well I should probably get back to work - which today means, studying for Algebra final while pretending to contribute to the corporation's goals.&nbsp; And stealing FudgeRounds out of the Atlas snack-drawer.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;- Kirvi
