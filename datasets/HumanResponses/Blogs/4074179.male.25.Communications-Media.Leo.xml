       Santa Barbara, Calif - July 29, 2004 - As a spectator, there is a high demand to protect the brown-eyed girl habitat of Southern California from the rising numbers of blue-eyed blondes who have made homes in many towns throughout Ventura and LA county. Like many native species of the region, the brown-eyed girl is rapidly declining in numbers given the exponential population growth of the blue-eyed blonde.   According to environmental researcher, Tom Smith says that "there is a real need to find the brown-eyed girl and to support them in an attempt to preserve a state treasure. Extinction seems imminent as many stock up on the necessary products to insure there survival in the blonde nation. The blond menace is reshaping the S. California ecosystem. If state funding could be obtained, I would spend more time researching this situation. However, I am not in the position to do so. I leave this situation in the hands of the brave people of S. California.  Be strong... help is on the way.  :)

       So it is kind of like exiting one world and entering a new world. In the first world you are broke - but it is okay. It is okay because everyone in this world is broke except for the rare exceptions. Your time there is fun and you enjoy, not only the interaction, but hopefully the information learned. Then, like in birth, you squeeze your way out into the other world. In this world, you seek a career and money. Let's face it, you need these things... for in this world you are not interested in living on the street or going hungry.  These two worlds are very common to all. Most, at one point or another, went through the small door and came to dwell in the new world. This is the time upon which one graduates from college and enters the world of business or whatever...  Like a naked, starving baby hanging upside down being smacked on the but... I have entered this world. In the footsteps of those before me... I seek the confines of the new world through employment. Being in this stage is an adventure as my good friend Miss Julie would say... and I believe her. Yet, I can't help but think about the advantages of no longer being on this journey to find a job. It's sort of like a treasure hunt... and the more you look... the more in debt you become. In time, you hope to find the job that will fill the financial void of your adventure. May we all find the treasure... so that we may all enter the new world and quit being smacked on the butt like a newborn baby.  Enjoy reader... Remember this story isn't based on actual events. Many of the situations discussed have NOT happened in real-life... also I speak only of the situation that plagues my friend's best friend's brother's cousin's girlfriend's nephew. So I hardly no the person at all.
