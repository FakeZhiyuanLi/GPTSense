      I thought you were everything To me.. You represented everything.. I gave you my all Thinking you had all the answers  But now. I have moved on.  Finally I have found happiness And For once It doesnt include you.  I met him. I thought he was nothing Because You were my everything.  He showed me the way. He gave me his hand to hold. And I climbed the long journey with him. Putting my trust in him. And for once I am not afraid To move forward with someone else.  I no longer blame myself. I no longer hold on to past regrets. I have realized my mistake In placing the blame on me. When you were the one creating all the problems.  Its ok now. Its over now. All we have left are memories  And.  I have began a new journey. So now I whisper final words in my last chapter to you. Goodbye.

      My insides are full of tears Tears that refuse to release...  All I know is When I think of you.. I realize What I have lost...  I know you have your loyalties Your trust but I also know You want to believe me.  All I know is... I am begging for one more chance One shot at love... One shot at a future with happiness One shot of what could be.  My friends all tell me different things.. I dont know whose advice to take. I dont want to lose you. Something that has already happened. I dont want to be annoying nuisance you have. I just want to know where your at.  All I know is... My heart is singing out to you.  You trapped me in your world.. Causing me to fall for you. I would have done anything for you. I did things with you that I didnt do with anyone.  All because I thought you were special. I thought I meant something to you. Apparantly not.  I just have one question: Are you suffering as much as me? Do you think of me when you wake up and when you go to sleep..  Do you wish you could go back to the way things used to be?  I know what we had was short It didn't last long due to.. Outside influences  Yet  It was the best thing that happened to me. It was something that entered my life and  Made me smile every day I had the happiness I never experienced.  They say: It is better to have loved than not loved at all.. I truly believe in that   Because... While this heartwrenching pain refuses to go away I would never give up what I had with you That is something I will never forget  Something new Something different and Something full of spice  So while you cause me to suffer every day I would like to say: Thank You Thank you for giving me something no other could give and thank you for taking my heart away and not giving it back.

      So I hate how I am always looking for new updates in ppls blogs and they NEVER update them. Like my sister. She refuses to update them and it really annoys me...  On a side note.. I went on a date with Mr. Nice Guy last night.. IT was cool we went to Caffe Italia, we saw Mean Girls (which is such a good movie!!), and we had ben and jerry's ice cream... Then he came over to my place and we just talked.. Overall it was a good date butt what really made me upset was when we kissed... OK this may sound REALLY bad but when we kissed I was thinking of Rejector the entire time and I was thinking man I wish I was kissing Rejector right now!! Thats soo bad!!! AND to make things worse when we were driving to Cafe Italia I saw a green camry and kept looking at the driver AND when we went to ben and jerry's I thought that I saw Rejector at Pluto's but I wasnt sure.. Plutos was where Rejector and I went on our first date... sigh :( I told Koco today she goes thats ok your not over Rejector.. Yeah I am definatly not over him and freaking Mr. Nice Guy is coming out with us tonight and I really hope Rejector will not be there not unless he realizes what a mistake he made in letting me go...  man I really dont want to chair for the conference butt I dont have a choice.. It kynda ruins my whole weekend.. Not that its not already ruined with my Rejector/Mr. Nice Guy drama that is guaranteed to happen..  I called my friend last night to chat.. he put me on the phone with his friend who was visiting..(whom I have never met) I ended up talking to his friend for like 1-2hrs on the phone.. Crazy huh?  what else is there... I am at my internship right now...  Oh well...we'll see what tomorrow brings...  I think this is my first birthday that I have not looked forward to and thats because of all the drama thats occurring around the weekend..  i remember on my first date with Rejector he asked me if I would cook for him...Man I wish I could go back to those days...

      So as usual Im listening to sad love songs in my car...  Then I talk with kookie about Rejector. She told me maintaining my reputation is the most important thing. She told me she thinks all of Rejectors friends see me as an easy lay... Thats really embarassing.. I hope they dont... Butt yeah she said because I went to his place that one night ppl will assume that...  Then today I went to Safeway and coming home I heard Naughty Girl on the end. I got so mad!! I just started cussing and stuff and finally I found Dont want you back on one of my tapes and I started screaming the song... Yeah...  Then I got home and had dinner with Foxxy...  Then I chatted with Koco about Rejector. She made me realize that he really mistreated me. He didnt treat me right. I told her how I wanted to talk to him and she gave me both sides of the verdict. As I started chatting some more she decided it wasnt such a good idea... She thinks I should bring out Mr. Nice Guy... At first I was like noo.. I dont want to cuz I dont... butt uhhh well he texted me thinking of you,need to go back to studying for my finals :-(     That was soo nice and sweet... butt anyways im hoping that if i bring out mr. nice guy rejector will get jealous and realize how much he wants to be with me... Just like in Somethings Gotta Give..  Anyhow...thats the deal-o  my sorry ass needs to get going on my paper for polysci

      Why are you filled with hate? After all the sweet things you said... After all the tenderness you showed... After everything we shared...  It may not have been much It may not have been long  But for me It was special It was beautiful It was something I could not express through words.  You consume all my thoughts, my dreams, my everything. When I go to sleep, I think of you. When I wake up, I think of you. When I work, I think of you. When I study, I think of you.  I dont have any regrets.. Only that I didnt make that one mistake. That fatal night.. And Scaring you off.  Its not like I cheated on you. Its not like I manipulated you. All I did. Was be honest and truthful.  And what I get in return  Is your silence and hatred. For what? Did I do anything wrong?  For once, Can you step into my shoes And See where I was coming from. Instead, You listen to others And Think only of yourself.  I wish  I could turn back the hands in time Erase history Start all over again.  But I cant...  So I will retreat Into my little hole... And wonder If you will ever see me through.  One day My innocence will be proved. You will regret Treating me the way you did. I hope that day Comes soon. And for your sake... That I will still be around.  All I know is.. Im being accused of something I didnt do. You wont even give me a chance to explain myself.  Maybe you dont want me anymore. Maybe you dont care about me anymore. And this is.. Your way out.  I guess I'll never know... All I know is.. This pain refuses to go away..

      OK so as much as I want to hate Jason and blame him for everything I cant...  I mean yeah he did say things about me that werent true, he is talking shit about me to Rejector who would obviously believe his roommate over me butt he's not the only one in blame here.  Most of it  is  my fault. I am the one that overreacted that one night. I am the one that kept talking to Jason on the phone, and I am the one that was "checking up" on Rejector even though I wasnt.  I think part of it is also that night I must have freaked out Rejector.. I mean I did act psycho saying he's right there, i know he is. And all that drama...  Part of it could be Rejector using Jason as a scapegoat. He maybe doesnt want to have to do anything with me because of the fact of what happened that night with me acting up and all...   All I know is Im hurting here... A lot.. It sucks to be in this situation and I wish he would give me another chance, the benefit of the doubt, or just hear me out. All I know is.. I am going to talk to him about it and he can be rude to me, break my heart all over again (he already did it once so whats another time around?), or just simply ignore me. I just hope he will allow me to give my 2cents and listen to what I have to say...

      SO you all know how the song Naughty Girl.. Beyonce f. Lil Flip reminds me of Rejector right?  Well I decided to post the lyrics here...[Lil' Flip talking] Ladies and gentlemen! This is the remix, Houston's finest Lil' Flip, Beyonce holla at 'em  [Lil' Flip] Posted up in the back of the party girl 'cause I don't wanna good girl,I wanna naughty girl I like ya style and ya body girl And we can leave the spot in my Mazarazi girl anything you need I got it girl cause I'm connected my game perfected I'm reppin Texas everytime I spitt this ain't a one night stand I wanna make you my chick (yea)  [Lil' Flip]  I'm a tell you what I like,you can tell me what you like 'cause it ain't no thing for me to book you a flight(Uh) or better yet we can charter a jet I'll take you to foreign countries that you ain't been yet(Uh) after a month I know ya feelings gettin stronger 'cause when we on the phone now we conversate longer You know I want ya,I ain't playin wit ya mind I just wanna spend time,if that's cool I'm fighting Temptations cause ain't nobody like you I like ya belly ring and that cute tattoo I make moves like the boss on the low so holla at Lil' Flip when you ready to roll (woah!)   This is the part he would always rap to me... The from the beginning to "to foreign countries you aint been yet" then he'd ask me to rap the rest of the song.. Sigh...  In the car kookie and I heard Naughty Girl.. She wouldnt let me listen to it. She said it was cuz its played out--which is true. I know she is sick and tired of it butt I also think its cuz she knows it reminds me of him.

Then today, kookie and I went not once butt 2x to get fast food... Jake had asked us on friday if we were athletes cuz of our fly bodies.. Butt uhh today kookie was funny when she's like yeah we wont be athletes any more!! hee hee...

      So I had an endless night of sad waves washing over me...  I told my best friend Cristina everything---She told me she thinks that Rejector's rmate is purposely creating drama for me cuz I used to talk to him last year. Butt its like he likes kookie and I never did anything with him other than dancing and harmless flirting butt she was still like you know how guys are.. She also thought that he hella yelled at me to look all macho in front of his friends..She also thinks Rejector is confused about how he feels about me.  So anyways Koco was kickin it in my room and she had asked me a bunch of questions earlier. I had just finished reading all my poems from my blog to her and kookie. So Koco made me answer her questions. She goes I am a pro at heartbreak..trust me if anyone knows its me.  So I told her how I felt. She gave me her honest assessment of what she thought. She said I think your going to go out and he's going to go out. If you see him, do not go up to him not unless he comes up to you and in that case say hi. Yeah. So thats the deal-o.   I wrote a lot of poems about him. Usually if I like a guy then I will write 1 poem.. Butt as you can tell from my postings, I have written hella poems about him.  yeah anyways im going with sexy koco to the mall so ill catch ya fine asses lata

      You broke my heart.  You took everything I had. Shredded it to pieces. Threw it away. And Stomped on it.  All I know is... I am never ever ever going to give a guy my heart again.  All because of what you did to me.  This pain I have inside.. It wont go away. Why? I wonder could it be..because you caused it.  I really thought you were the innocent one. That your friends were trying to tear us apart. Incite us against one another and create drama. But I guess it was you all along.  You just wanted to get rid of me. String me along for the ride.  Your the first one I ever gave my heart to. I had many opportunites, But I thought you were different.  I guess you werent. All guys are the same..  All they want is bootie  All I know is my heart is aching Im in pain And this pain  will never go away..

      OK so I went to the grad with kookie...  I looked hella fine..sporting my short ass white skirt and babygrl tank...  So we see Joe and he's nice to kookie and me..  Well to make a long story short....Rejector officially broke my heart tonight...  I saw him talking to 2 grls.. One with brown hair the other a blonde.. SO yeah I was talking to hella guys...  I kept watching him.. He was talking mostly with Jason, Mike, Ryan.. Ray hella ignored me...  Jason kept touching me and stuff...  Then...Finally I get the guts to tap him..He was soo mean to me. He at first was like do i know you? I dont think I know you? SO I said my name and kept looking at him. He said stop looking at me.. Dont look at me. If your leaving then just leave...  Then I keep looking at him.. He straight up told me did you talk shit to my rmate last week? I go I dont remember talking shyt to your roommate but if I did..Im sorry. Then he goes i just want you to know that I never fucking talk to grls who cuss out my friends.. Then those fucking kutis go Seema! Seema! Seema! Seema! as if i didnt have enough drama to deal with.. I almost started crying at that point.. Kookie noticed I was shaking... I just turned my back to everyone and faced the bar.  Then at the end of the night I talked to Jason... I told him what happened I go your rmate is being mean to me. He goes dont mind him-he's just drunk.  Yeah probably fucking those goris. Cuz I looked at the end of the night he was gone...  This is the sad thing. I hella looked at him. Even though Mr. Nice Guy is physically more attractive than Rejector to me Rejector was the finest guy I ever saw.  All I know is my heart is broken and I am really upset...  I told Koco everything.. I couldnt stop crying...Im in so much pain... I told her how I saw something in his eyes.. That I know he still feels for me. She told me he was just trying to get rid of me and not to blame his friends. Because his friends in my opinion were just trying to create problems between us...they didnt want to see us together... thats what I feel anyways..  All I know is this pain wont go away and it really hurts...  Seema

      OK so you know how I am really bored?  Well I was just staring at my blog. Staring at it.. Not even reading anything and suddenly the words Me, Myself and I caught my attention..  When I first got my blog my sisi goes i really like that song by Beyonce. I go oh yeah.. she has a song called me, myself, and I!! I forgot about that.. the phrase just appeared in my head and I decided to use it when i was creating this blog tho..  Its funny at my internship-before when I shared this office with nick, sewit, and amy no one had my office #. Then I got the 18th floor... I didnt have a #. Now Im back here, everyone has my phone number here... its really interesting reflecting on that..  Well anyways when I was driving to Sac this morning I was flipping channels and me, myself, and i came on. It was the first time in a long time i really listened to the lyrics. I have been doing that a lot lately-that my hearts been hurting...  I listened to it for awhile until I realized the situation in the song was different from mine. I dont know I just felt like being gay like that...  Well in that song, Beyonce's voice is truly beautiful. Now I know i love shakira and all... Butt in that one song out of all songs Beyonce's voice truly sounds soft, sweet, sexy, longing all of the above ya know? I was just listening to her voice and I was literally touched by all the emotions I detected in her voice.. I was like wow... almost at a loss for words... She also sounds that way in Brown Eyes, and Emotions from Destny's Childs last cd. I love those songs too..  Speaking of Emotions, I LOVE that video. Its so touching. Everytime I watch it, I cry. For some reason that song reminds me of Courtney and it makes me sad.   Other songs that remind me of Courtney are I'll be Missing You (P. Diddy f. Faith Evans), and Love Takes Time.  Its funny how songs can transition for different meanings..  Like originally I liked I'll be Missing You because it reminded me of JSA Summer 1997 and the Serra bldg. That was me and my homiez songs.. Then after Courtneys thing it reminded me of her.  With Love Takes Time.. That song always reminded me of Courtney. Today I was in the car listening to my tape to that song and it totally reminded me of Rejector. Why? Because if you really truly listen to the lyrics, it represents how I feel.  Back to the Emotions video.. Although I think all of them have bad situations, Michelle's takes the cake. Her grandma dying.. That is soo sad. I have some friends whose grandparents are everything to them, almost like a surrogate parent. Thats hard to deal with.   I really like the Emotions video.. There are underlying themes in there that are really deep. I also have always liked Michelle because I feel like she has always been given the shaft. In that video her voice is really showcased. Next time you see that video listen to her part. She truly has a beautiful voice.  The Destny's Child CD is really good. The last one they put out. It has the typical lovey dovey themes, butt it also has deep issues that ppl deal with on an everyday basis like death, rape, faith. Things like that.  Another CD I really like that is deep and showcases a hella tyte combo is that of Dream. The one with He Loves Me, He Loves You Not. I used to work at the Post Office on campus 2 yrs ago and I would play that cd along with BSB all the time. Ppl would come in and ask who I was listening to. Their voices mesh well together in a soft, sweet melodic tone  and  they have really deep good tunes.. I need to get that cd.  I used to meet closet BSB fans all the time in the PO cuz id be playing their cds. I would bump into the most hippest, craziest, trendy grls. (I am very trendy myself) Thats what I love about the Backstreet Boys. Their fan base is very diverse. At the concert you see young ppl, old ppl, moms-dads-kids, grandmas-grandpas, ppl of all colors shapes sizes and forms. At Nsync concerts you see mainly teenyboppers.. Im not trying to hate, im just telling it the way it is. Because I have been to both concerts..  For those that know me and were wondering: yes I do still like the backstreet boys, no im not psycho like i used to be, and yes i am waiting for a new cd to come out...  until next time  Peace  ps i only have 2 minutes... yippee!!!

      OK so I am officially bored...  The proclamation is pretty much wrapped up and I dont have anything to do. I mean I could work on answering a letter but those are so tedious and I'm not in the mood for it.  I just called Zarqa about Awaaz...She's going to get back to me at the end of the week. She's not going to the Senior Dance get together butt I am.. It sounds like it will be fun..   So i have 30 minutes to chill...  Dont worry I wont bore you all with another poem about Rejector.   I was envisioning myself at the grad in my tiny ass skirt and hoping he was there... Only in my dreamstate he never showed up and I was sad.  Yeah. I hope I can patch things up with him, because he consumes all my thoughts...  Im soo bored...so whats up?   I really dont want to do the MUN spring conference anymore.. butt its really messed up to back out with 10 days to go. SO i will stick with it...  Man I have to go to Cats house after my internship for Dais training... You know I never heard the word Dais until the Berkeley conference... My chair kept referring to himself as the Dais, so I thought oh another name for Chair.  Do you know how bored I am? Sure I have the internet butt theres only so many times you can check your email and your blogs...  I think I am the only one that is thys obssessed with blogs..its fun tho.. and it gives me something to do to pass the time.  Why does Shem never answer his phone? does he realize how annoying it is when you keep trying to call? hmm maybe he like rejector is avoiding my calls cuz he's tired of talking about rejector.. hee hee  ITs a miracle how i was sooo sick yesterday and how dayquil nyquil and prayers transformed me into what i am today.  I washed my hair this morning so right now it looks like a bush...  I am still debating on straightening my hair or straightening it and then curling it for tonight...  hmmm....

      I am so alone Without you I am nothing. I long To feel your arms wrapped around me. Whispering sweet nothings in my ear To have things back The way they used to be.  I wish I could turn back time. If I could. I would change the past. Erase uncertainties. And be happy again.  You were the only one I could truly be myself with. You were the only one Who made me feel. You were the only one I felt comfortable around.  If you saw how I am feeling. You would run away. You would be so scared  To face reality. Wait. Thats how things are now.  Why are you listening to your fears? Why are you listening to what others are saying? Why not? For once. Just listen to your heart.  If you did. We would be one again. Happiness would take over. And together we could erase those sleepless nights.  I wont lie. I have met others. But not one of them Come even close to you.  What have you done to me? That I have become so dependant on you for my happiness? You consume everything I am. All I have left are my memories.  Memories so few. Memories that wont be erased. Not until you erase them.  I will not forget you. I will not abandon my hope. That someday, somehow you will learn to forget the past. Forgive me for my mistake. And give me another chance. The day you look me in the eye and tell me you feel nothing. Is the day I will move on.  Not a day passes that I dont think of you. Everything and anything reminds me of you. I hope you wont say goodbye to something so special, so intimate, so crazy. Because not only will you break my heart, But you will lose something great.  I know you cant resist me. One look, and I will know everything. I long to see you, to kiss you, to talk to you. Until that day.  I remain  Lonely.

      Man I dont know what happened to me!!  I got soo sick at my internship yesterday..I had to leave my class early cuz I was so sick. I was so mad because we were learning Brazilian dances and I really liked it... There was only one part I didnt get :(  On the flip side.. I kept sneezing and blowing my nose in my Polysci class. So much this guy gave me his packet of tissues.. So much that my professor who started taking role last week and I didnt go because I had internship stuff to do and I got sick told me he wasnt going to excuse me and then yesterday after class he told me he will excuse me. I dont know.. maybe its because he is so young butt I feel really comfortable talking to my professor like he is a friend.. I dont talk to him like he's a professor.. Its funny...  So I get on the bus and I see Jenil and Anu... I chat with them about being Indian, the culture show, and the after party.. Oh and Tejas' antics who I called Tejal.. oops.. I also saw my roommate and kicked it with her... It was cool..  I think we were entertaining the whole bus.. hee hee... So kal ho na ho is showing next week at chem 194... I think im going to go!!  Anyhow, Koco and I kicked it last night. We had the most intimate conversation about guys and love and other stuff... I really enjoyed our conversation... Plus we talked about Rejector and she agreed with me that she thinks he still has feelings for me. She told me that he wouldnt have come up to her and asked her about me and stuff then. She thought it was me he was talking to on the phone tho. When I said it was prolly some other grl she said you dont know that. She also told me he was alone at the end of the night which made me feel better.   I really really really want to patch things up with him. I have been praying so much to God for it. I really miss him. I know he misses me too.. I hate it when other things come in the way. I have been listening to love songs that remind me of the situation.. yeah.. If it doesnt go, then I wont listen to it..  I dont know, Im soo depressed...  Please rejector, give me one more chance. I wont fuck up I promise. All I am asking for is one more chance. You wont regret it I promise.

      So I had this dream last night that Rejector called me. I dreamt that I was in kookies car with her and he called me. I answer the phone and Im all sick and I saw it was him calling cuz his name was on my phone. He goes yeah its me. And we were talking and it was all good...   I wish that were reality...  I am hoping that on Friday I will see him and he will try to talk to me. And we will iron things out and things will be back to the way they used to be.. I keep acting like we were in a relationship or something.. It's all his fault.. He trapped me in his lil happy world...  Like his roommate  EVEN  stands a chance with kookie now after all the shyt he said about me. I mean I would understand if what he said was true and I guess I can see where he was coming from butt the things he said was just WRONG!!! Obviously Rejector is going to believe his homey, his roommate over me butt man it sucks...  Its like why the hell would you want to ruin your roommates happiness ya know? Butt I know he was trying to protect him from getting hurt.. I guess from his point of view... Before he was the one that was sprung, now its me. Except I'm hurting...   Yeah...Anyways I need to get to my Proclaimation so I'll catch you later...  I told Simran today..We always talk in the mornings when she's driving to school and Im driving to my internship...thats my only downtime with her.. She thinks I need to forget about Rejector and move on with my life.. Its hard tho cuz he's got me in the palm of his hands...  oh well...  Back to work!!!  On the flip side...Sewit is coming to my birthday dinner.. She changed her vacation plans so she could come. I feel so honored :) I'm thinking I want to have it in Sacramento instead of Dixon, cuz I have been to both and the one in Sacramento is nicer!!  Until next time.

      Why do we cross paths we know dont stop? Why did I allow my heart to fall? Why did I end up at this point?  All I know is... If you gave me a second chance... Everything would be different  Now I know what sappy love songs are about The ethos and the pathos The emotions, the singing, the wailing All in all the gut  Why are you so obstinate? Why have you moved on? After everything that happened Was I just another grl?  Apparantly.  Why does it hurt so? Its not because you dont care. Its not because you dont feel. Its not because you have moved on.  I know you still care. I know you still want me. I know you still miss me.  You think being at the point were at is the best for the both of us. But I know if you were to see me now. You would go livid with jealousy. You wouldnt be able to leave me.  Why do you have to listen to what others have to say? Yes I may have done that in the past. But Im not anymore. Im listening to my heart. My heart that is calling out to you. But your rejecting it. Rejecting it because your afraid of the future.  Afraid of what you desire to grab, to hold on to.  I was always afraid of rejection. My pride got in the way. Until I met you. You made everything easy. You did all the hard work. All I had to do was say yes, take your hand, and enter your world.  But now the going has got tough and you decided to let go. I didnt. Im the strong one because I know what the impossible holds. Your the weak one because your afraid of the impossible.  You see I am able to look past everything and hold on to hope. You take everything through details and let that control you. I used to do that. But once I realized I lost you. I learned my lesson.  Not to let the impossible, improbable, and reality control me. But to let my heart go. Let it fly past everything and speak for itself. Thats what its doing right now Speaking to you. Rejection.

      So today I had my Nepali Presentation...  Phil called me because he needed me to work on my endnotes for my brief...so my lazy ass got to work on it... Actually I had been up since 8:30am-i was waiting for Koco to get out of the showa...  Anyways Keenan called me to discuss plans for heading over there... I dont know if I have mentioned it, butt I think he's cute...even if he has a grlfriend... hee hee..  So I am frantically finishing up my speech, going over finishing touches with Phil, ya know basically freaking out...  Then all of a sudden I have butterflies swarming my tummy about the Presentation...Im hella scared and calling up Catharine, Kris, Shem anyone I can think of to calm me down.. Finally I get through to my mom and she gives me sum advice...  So it takes me FOREVER to find Hielems office...oh well...I eventually found it after Keenan dropped me off... Lauren and I cut the barfi together and I practiced my speech which was 10 minutes.. their all you better shorten it!!!   So we all head over to class together minus Saadia and Phil.. yeah.. so I call them to find out where their at.. Then I make an announcement about the food...  OK so basically Saadia hella messed up on her opening... Poor thing looked like she was about to cry, butt it was cuz she got no sleep at all. Personally I think she did ok. Butt whatever...  The rest of us kicked ass aparantly... Saadia had her stuff down too she was just nervous...thats all...  Hielam and I overlapped a little...Most of the questions were at Helen in the economic perspective... Phil answered one of my questions but thats because no one answered and thats because no one remembered the question.. Yeah.. I answered a few... It was cool...  So hella ppl at mithae and stuff...And i guess we did a good job...  Then we made plans to kick it at Keenans place sometime next week or something.. We'll all get drunk... hee hee... sounds like a plan to me!!  I really liked everyone in my group :)  Then stupid freak...ya know the one that led me on last qtr comes up to me and asks me about the show and stuff... I was friendly cuz ya gotta be in those kind of situations butt I wont forget what he did to me...He goes I want to watch a hindi movie with you.. I felt like saying why cuz im wearing my pin striped suit? hee hee oh well.. Veronica came up to me and gave me a hug.. I cant believe she is married... that is some krazy shyt right there!!! So he tries to flirt with me and walks me to the IR bldg.. He was jealous cuz Daniel was sitting in his spot I guess... Daniel is my friend I dont care!! ha ha  So I go in there and chat with Daniel about our presentations... He said the ambassador was worried cuz we didnt do a run thru.. Well I wanted to butt no one else did.. oh well.. He said it was really good and ran smoothely.. So he ate some mithae and so did Jackie and Jeri.. It was cool...  Everyone loves mithae  So while on the bus I called kris up and told him about my presentations.. I will always consider kris a friend.. he was my friend this entire year through MUN. We met in the computer lab and exchanged screennames... He had told me awhile ago he liked my pin striped suit so I told him I was wearing it... So I told him about Mr. Grlfriend and how he was trying to flirt... OK im just going to say his name here because its not as if he reads this..Actually I'll call him Rejector because obviously he has no interest in me anymore otherwise he'd called me by now.. The guy I am not over, the one I cant get over, the guy  I  fucked up with is Rejector. So I told Kris what I did last night.. Kris doesnt think Tim cares because he would have called me by now or something... ANYWAYS my question is where the fuck is shem? he's never ever around.  HE'S  the one i need advice from...  Why is it you always want what you cant have? Just wondering thats all. Why cant Rejector give me a second chance? I promise I wont fuck up... Why are all his friends so gay? OK OK OK anywayssss  Saadia sent us all an email apologizing about her blunder... Im like sweetie you did NOT blunder.. you were just a lil shook up thats all... I was happy cuz everyone from our group ate the mithae at the end.. Afterwards Daniel goes: the Ambassador  hella  missed out, the food was soooo GOOD!!!

I really enjoyed going to the group presentation meeting... I think I dazzled everyone with my being on top of my game.. Im glad I went cuz I really like everyone in the group... I made a bunch of new friends.. We have fun together :)    I bumped into Teja from the Culture Show at the gas station... I was talking to him about the aftapty... He was bragging about starting fights... Im like thinking uhhh ok... SO anyways... he invited me to this frat indian party butt im thinking in my head... no i dont think so.. He's a koolkat and all butt I dont think the pty will be too sich or anything like that so yeah...  Phil helped me with the powerpoint because I didnt know how to do it... Thanks Phil.. I appreciate that... I told them I am sure the fact that we all really like each other will project in our presentation!! Keenan goes yeah our group chemistry... that sounded funny "group chemistry"  I had absolutely no idea that Keenan was part of a frat before..  I told Lauren about  him . She told me I should call him... guys like that when you call them and say sorry... Kookie wants me to invite the guy I am seeing tomorrow to the grad on friday.. I kind of dont want to tho... I am secretly hoping  he  will be there...   Koco left me a sweet note on my blogs...that meant a lot to me... the triple threat foxxy trina and dirrty or should i say koko karamel and kookie got a lil sumsum from wendys...woohoo...  well my fine ass needs to prepare my speech so late...

      OMG the scariest thing just happened to me!!!  I'm so LUCKY to be alive!!!!  So I am driving to SAC to get mithae about to merge on 99S when I suddenly I hear this loud crashing noise... Naughty Girl was playing (for anyone that doesnt know ryte now thats one of my joints) At first I thought it was the road, butt then I realized it was my car... I quickly pulled over to the right side and called my friend Sarah. I was shaking almost crying and asked her what to do.. She told me to call AAA Roadside Assistance, so I did. I was hella shaky on the phone... the lady was really nice tho.. She was sending a rush out for me. Then my dumbass called  him . I only called him cuz i knew he lives in Sac and thought maybe he could change the tire for me. Of course he didnt answer the phone... prolly screening my calls...  Talk about feeling like a major loser...  Then I get to the Pakistani Market and this stupid white guy who looks like a chala goes DAMN!!! GRL YOU FIIINE!!! and he starts talking abt how he's russian this and that... i was hella scared still so I just looked at the floor and he said some obscene things to me.. Luckily the Uncle was working and there was and Uncle and Auntie in front of me so I felt safe. I felt since I was desi they wouldnt let anything bad happen to me. Sometimes the fob culture pays off...  So on the way back, the other guy calls me... He asked me if I was still on for tomorrow night... I said yeah.. I was happy cuz he was on his way to study.. I know I know that sounds hella gay butt at least he's got something going on.. I dunno tho his voice is kynda weird.. i dont really like his voice... oh well sigh...  I saw Kris and Kristy on campus today.. I really like them both... Duh I like Kris... we only got hella tyte over spring break and this qtr... Butt I really like Kristy... I think she's a nice grl, I am prolly the only chica in MUN that likes her... oh well...  Anyways I gotta bounce to mah presentation group...  Minha Baji if your reading this... dont tell mom.. im going to tell her about the tire myself k?

      OK so I am officially obsessed with this thing!!  Dont think you know everything tho....I still have my diary...  SO I completely choked on my midterm.. Butt i was very happy to find out that its only 10% of my grade.. So I can still have an A or a B in the class...  Good thing Latin American Studies was my area studies otherwise I would have completely choked on the Latin American part of the maps... I dunno about the African maps tho...  The essays were ok tho...  I really like my class...everyone in it is really cool and nice... The teacher is kynda wack tho.. butt for some reason I thynk she likes me...  So I walk out of my class and I have a msg on my celly.. I thynk is it him? No it couldnt be!! And I keep telling myself its not him its not him its not him... Its just that last time I walked out of that class and had a msg on my phone it was from him.. Sadly it was Catharine... Sorry Cat telling me about the extra chair mtg tomorrow morning... As stoked as I am to do it, I dont know if I can make the mtg cuz I have to practice for my presentation.... Actually I am beginning to have second thoughts about chairing... Shem told me I should stick with it and do it butt I dunno anymore im in that 50/50 zone right now...  Oh yeah in my class ppl kept making announcements about shows and dances and our teacher talked about some Vietnamese dance thang... It made me wonder... Should I have made an announcement about my culture show? Oh well its too late!!!  So now that my midterm is over I can trypp out about my presentation tomorrow... My mom emailed my brief back to me so Im assumming she liked it... I went through geckomail to look at my old position papers I had emailed to Nishan for past conferences and the formatting was similar so hopefully my brief will be good enough... Some ppl in my group did essay format and others did other formats... Oh well let the best man win  Last night Sonia was reading some cute ass quotes to me about love and stuff like that... there was one that i really liked about crushes falling in love etc... Ill put it up once i figure it out...   Man I am starving and I already had lunch.. I would just go home and write up my speech butt my polysci professor has started taking role every class so I cant miss any... :(  I still have to go to East West to pick up my mithae...the Uncle better have it in by now!!!

      OK OK so I am a procrastinator....what can I say?  I finally finished my brief last night...at around 2:30am....whew!!! I put the finishing touches to it this morning...  Right now I am freaking out about my midterm I have in 2 hrs...  I wrote this poem about him last week. I needed to submit a poem and the poem I really wanted to submit I couldn't find... So I quickly whipped it up... I am going to share it w/ all yo sorry asses: 				  The Storm                  By Seema Kareemi   5/03/2004  Everything was great  So  Why have we ended up at this point? We were so happy. . .  In our own little world With words and actions speaking our every move. Then,  The storm hit. Rains poured the skies Allowing stupid nothings. . . Like confusion, denial, jealousy, control Coming in slowly, slyly, stealthily Only to manipulate the atmosphere. With you I found Serenity, calmness, happiness. I was able to fully express myself, Something I had never done with another person before. Yet, When the storm hit, The tides washed ashore Causing us to drift further and further apart. First with fights, then distance Finally, here at this point. It is only now I have learned my lesson. Not to let others get in the way of happiness. I can control my own destiny. Not to listen to others. Instead, listen to myself.  I always think of you and what we shared. Now, I have learned my lesson. My only question is. . . Have you learned yours?  yes yes yes my loser ass cant stop thinking about him... i know i know i am such a freak... if he really cared about me he would have called me by now...which he hasnt done... so obviously he was full of shyt... he didnt give a rats ass about me... butt still i cant help the way i feel so i will retreat into my lil hole... actually i will go back to studying...  I have to go pick up mithae today for my Nepal group presentation.. AND i dont have a prepared speech... I dont know for some reason I am not too worried. Perhaps it is because of my MUN experience... look at me i act like a war veteran... me and my cocky ass... What I am worried about is the overall presentation... the questions ppl will ask me no.. butt my speech yes... Hopefully it will flow smoothely...  At this point I feel the only ppl in my group that like me are Saadia and Keenan. Keenan cuz he sent me an email abt the culture show and was the only one that responded to my email about the mithae saying he trusted my judgement.. Saadia, cuz she and I have constantly been on the phone through this ordeal.. and altho I think she sides with Phil a lot she likes me a lot and has my back...

      OK so I officially feel bad...  I got off the phone with Saadia about 45 minutes ago...  And started working on my brief which I should be doing now instead of thys stupid shyt...  I feel really bad because I wasnt on top of my game... I was hanging out with my friend today and she goes man you really have Senioritis...  I think i do.. or maybe its the Spring Fever.... Or maybe its my obsessing over this guy I really like... or maybe its a culmination of my being a college student and about to leave...  Everything got put into perspective the other day when I realized I was living my life for other people. I was doing things to please other people. I did what my friends told me to do. I did what my parents told me to do. Instead of thinking for myself and doing what  I  wanted to do!!! Maybe if I had listened to my heart and listened to my gut feeling then I wouldnt be in this mess. Here I go again... going off on another tangent... I intended on writing about procrastination and how I feel guilty and I end up fraying into my personal corner that I cant escape...  I guess what Im trying to say is that Im sorry that I listened to what other ppl expected of me and not what I expected of myself. I will never forget that blunder and hope I dont repeat that mistake again...

      Wassup Wassup Wassup?   So today is officially my first day doing tha Bloggerishific thang.. You see I got it from my sistah... Thats right babye... This is just me attempting to once more procrastinate from studying... that is writing my brief and studying for my midterm... Once again my sexy sonia is attempting to keep my gay ass in check...   I realized today that gay is my favorite word to use... I use it way too much... i think its ingrained in my vocabulary...oops   OK so I am officially NOT OVER this guy... Lets just say I majorly fucked up :( and it sucks cuz he's all I keep thinking about. I am going on the ultimate dream date with this other guy on Wednesday butt its like I dont care. Id rather be with the other guy. I think he may still have feelings for me or he may be full of shit.   All my friends keep telling me to forget about him butt i cant help it... He's the only guy I want. The funny thing is I normally would have never gone for him---butt his sweet talking got to me... No guy ever made me feel the way he did!!!   One of my guy friends who is kynda like him: white and ghetto thinks it will work out...butt I dont know... All i know is anything and everything reminds me of him...i keep hearing sad love songs...oops :( OK enough mushy mushy   The culture show was tyte...The afta pty was tyte... We were all hoochified... Never seen so many indians in one joint.. I liked it tho cuz the guys were hella respectful... Of course there was a fight and yes i got my attention :) Hella ppl came up to me and told me how i kicked ass, they liked our outfits etc... major ego boost for me...   I am looking forward to going to the Grad on friday with sexysonia... Hopefully I will meet some fresh cute faces... I'm not going to look forward to it tho cuz i dont want to fuck it up y'know?   I am so glad I met Meera and Sonia. They are such koolkats.. Their friendships mean a lot to me.. I dont think they really understand how happy i am to be their friends...   mun is interesting....at the beginning of the yr i thought it was my life... now that ic things more clearly i can see how fake ppl are!! I feel like I can really only trust 2 other ppl in the club that I would consider friends... maybe a few more.. ITs funny how ppl keep changing personas and faces like its they keep jumping onto each other. Everyone talks shyt about everyone and the next minute acts like their best friend...i hate that shyt just be real y'know?   My best friend from the bay area is going to New York pretty soon after my graduation.. I know we dont talk that much butt im really going to miss her!!!   My grl Joy emailed me the other day... I was a bridesmaid in her wedding 2 yrs ago... She is preggers... yep yep... I was in shock!! I couldnt believe it... My rmates were like thats cool and happy and stuff.. I guess it was more of a shock for me cuz its like little joy...having one of her own!!!   Some ppl up in thys joint have serious disorders...I need to fix their problems...me and my homeys do... lets get their medications out foxxy...   Why are guys so confusing? Why do they consume our thoughts? Why do they make it seem like we control them when in reality we are the ones being controlled by them through emotions and feelings?   This is my first time baring my persona to la publica so please please be gentle with me... NE ways... i am a supercrazyweirdo as you can tell from my blog and lingo...butt damn straight skippy im proud of it!!!

      What does it mean? What does it stand for? Why does it confuse people so?  It will take you on a never ending journey In your quest for knowledge Your thirst broadening by the day.  Causing inner conflicts Destruction erupting. Only to replay past incidents and moments in your head.  Furthermore, It brings new experiences. With unexpected courses to take, Causing Utter confusion amongst many.  It is a test to see how far you can go. Death, birth,  Friendships and Relationships Coming and Going.  Fear, Love, Hate, Faith, and Hope All playing dominant indicators.. On a day to day basis.  There is no answer to Life. All we know is it is there... Existing Thus serving as the antithesis to existentialism.  Why do we question it? Why dont we? Why do we sit here pondering about mythology and psychology? The eternal answer is...  It is here And there is nothing we can do about it. So, Instead of  pushing it away, questioning its essence, and pondering past and future occurrences, Why dont we embrace it?  Ahh.. Then the debate is over? And for some of us... Such a suggestion is Preposterous.

      This cold keeps threatening To take over my personal demeanor I try and try But Waves of dizziness, nausea, and the pain in the back of my head Threaten my own being.  Being congested isnt fun. Perhaps it was hearing the passing of my friends father. Perhaps it was the rememberance of Courtney... Perhaps it is because it feels as if everyone; all my friends are leaving me.  All I know is... I am in a new state of transition... I dont like the way it feels. Because the ultimate outcome Is up in the air...  And the one thing I cant stand is suspense.  Last night I tossed and turned in my bed... As the heat came pouring in my bed... I got up and felt sick Nightmares of past, present, and futuristic events Came pouring into my memory....  Bringing forth fear, pain, despair, confusion and other emotions  I like the place Im at right now... I wish some players wouldnt act the way they do, But Thats life...  So I'll climb into my sea of sick feeling, lonliness, and uncertainty And hope that maybe tomorrow I'll return a brighter star That has no ailments or impediments... Simply Another Seema.
