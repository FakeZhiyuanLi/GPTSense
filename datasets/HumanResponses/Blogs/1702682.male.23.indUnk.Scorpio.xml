      It's amazing how much work you miss when you are sick for a day - I don't think that the fish I had at the "Rude Native" on Sunday was particularly fresh. I have been working non-stop today! It has been a little stressful at work; some market research that I requested turned out to be useless, I have been asked to follow up with people about contracts who seem to have dissapeared off the planet and I have been asked to put together a new survey for prospective customers by Thursday. Ah, the working life. Oh, and to top it off, I got my first tuition bill today for next term - a whopping $7,500.00.  I'm going to the gym tonight after work to do a back and arms workout; those are always fun. I am going to start a weight training blog to record my progress. I used to write everything down religiously at the gym, but it was too much effort to bring a notepad and pencil with me all the time. Instead I will just blog what I did as soon as I get home from the gym.  I'm getting really excited about my trip to Cozumel later this month. I spent the day deciding which adventure tour I want to do; I think I'm going to do the ATV, kayak, snorkel one. I really must get my NAUI referral updated, or else I won't be doing any SCUBA diving.

      How often do I get the chance to fly to a different city to go to a house party? Just once so far - this past weekend. Don's friend Scott was having a 40th birthday party in Ottawa, so we flew up on passes. The party was great, unfortunately I didn't get to see much of Scott and Steve's house, just the kitchen really. But, I had a very enjoyable time. While we were up in Ottawa, we had a chance to see Matt and Mark. I have known Matt for a long time, and Mark for as long as he's known Matt. They both used to go to the University of Waterloo; they moved to Ottawa about a year ago. I introduced them to Don while we were there, but he had already met Matt! Apparently, a couple of weeks ago they were both in a "best chest" contest at Icon (the Ottawa gay bar) during Ottawa pride. They were the only two guys in the contest and were both beaten by a lesbian with big breasts, it wasn't a big boobs contest, so God knows how she won it! Anyway, they chatted on stage a bit. I am getting less and less surprised by how small the gay world is.  What an eventful weekend! On Friday night I went to a BBQ at Don and Bruce's followed by Woody's and the Barn. I got so trashed at the BBQ - someone started pouring shots of Goldschlager (see the link - I don't know those people or anything, I just googled "how much gold in goldschlager") I think it was Gary - so I didn't even buy any drinks while we were out. Saturday was Ottawa and Sunday was Rick's birthday get-together. Rodney was goin to Rick's as well, so I drove him down to KW. That drive is getting so boring, so it was nice to have someone along for the ride. We had excellent food at the "Rude Native", which, unfortunately, was interrupted by some fairly awful live music. We headed over to Plantation (a coffee/dessert lounge) afterwards where a very nice French server stumbled through describing the available cakes; Rod and I were being very patient, her English was quite good, but slow. She was rudely interrupted by another server (what a jerk) who also took over our table. He gave me a raised eyebrow when I asked for soy in my latte and he was already in my bad books for being so rude to the French girl.

      I graduated from the University of Waterloo this April with a B.Sc. in science and business (biology option) with a minor in economics. It was a 5 year co-operative program, so I had 8 lecture terms and 4 work terms. I took a lot of molecular biology and genetics courses as well as some ecology and microbiology courses for the science component. The business component of the degree was mainly economics - I only had to take 2 additional courses to get an economics minor. I am glad that I was enroled in a co-operative program; the work experience has proven to be invaluable even at this early stage.   One of my work terms was at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto as a research assistant for an associate scientist (Dr. William Stanford) and a post-doctoral fellow (Dr. Morteza Bonyadi). The research was in developmental biology and genetics related to osteoporosis. Most of the job involved tissue culture, cell counts, slide prep., etc. which was pretty menial, but an experience I will never forget. I have cited the paper that Morteza finished after my tenure below (look for my name at the end of the article). There's a link to Bill's lab in my "links" section.  Mesenchymal Progenitor Self-Renewal Deficiency Leads to Age-Dependent Osteoporosis in Sca-1/Ly-6A Null Mice. Bonyadi, M., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA]. Vol. 100, no. 10, pp. 5840-5845. 13 May 2003.  My last work term was at Cybermation, Inc., a mid-sized enterprise software company in Markham, Ontario where I was a product marketing manager. I did a lot of work on pricing, vertical industry market analysis, etc. This is where I realized that software is not the industry for me. I find it so painfully boring.  In the fall, I will be starting a masters degree at the University of Waterloo's Centre for Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology. I'm very interested in science/biology related marketing, venture capital and business consulting. I would also like, at some point, to start my own business - hopefully something related to biotechnology. The MBET will give me graduate-level business training targeted towards technology and entrepreneuship/intrapreneurship - which I think meets my career goals quite well.  In the mean time, I have a summer job at Research In Motion, makers of the Blackberry wireless handhelds (see the link). I'm working, once again, in enterprise software. RIM makes software that interacts with a company's email server to allow emails, calendar information, etc. to be pushed out to wirelss handheld devices. I hate enterprise software, but I have high tuition to worry about next year and RIM pays very well. Plus, I had a lease in Waterloo continuing from my final year as an undergrad, so living is cheap as well as convenient.

      I'm starting a new blog. My old one was ugly, full of huge gaps (the longest being about six months), etc. And, things have changed quite a lot since then so it's about time! I will also be running two other new blogs which will be accessible by clicking on my profile.  From a biological perspective, there are only two things that make us who we are: our genes and our environment. Genes are portions of DNA; the environment can be anything from how well we were fed as children to what the weather is like outside to our lifelong thoughts and activites. Phenotypic plasticity is the concept that genetically identical individuals raised in different environments will display different phenotypes (physiological or behavioural characteristics). I chose the title phenotypic plasticity because my genes are not going to change but my environment will and so will my personality. My blog is a record of my thoughts and activites, and a glimpse of who I am.
