       So here I am again, Saturday night, nothing on the telly so I have just been reading through loads of old threads on the forum site.&nbsp; For some reason I seem to be eating sleeping and breathing WLS info at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The web site   urlLink  www.WLSINFO.gov.uk    has been a wonderful source of advice and support.   I do have good news though ..   I returned to my GPs surgery and saw my own GP rather than the fella I saw last time I broached the subject of WLS.. And it was a completely different reaction, my GP listened to what I had to say, looked at the research I took for him to look at, discussed it fully with me and informed me that not only have my local hospital employed a surgeon to carry out WLS but the local PCT were setting up a committee to see how they can implement the NICE recommendations in the given time scales. Horrrraaayyyy !!!&nbsp;   However as I know little about the surgeon employed locally I have still asked to be referred to Mr Sommers at King Edward in Midhurst.&nbsp; GP is going to find out about the funding and knows that if it is not a good sign that I will want to go privately asap.   Last night we (hubby and I) went to the south east support group run by Nell (from WLSINFO).&nbsp; It was really good to meet so many lovely positive people, and I came away feeling even more positive about my decision.&nbsp; Thanks to you all...   On Monday night I am going to meet some people who live even closer to us at the meeting being set up for the south coast.&nbsp; The more information I get at the moment the better informed I am when&nbsp;I see Mr Sommers.&nbsp; Its been nice getting to know Carol, and we have spoken a few times on the phone now.&nbsp; I think the peer support is invaluable during this journey.&nbsp; How can we talk to anyone who has not contemplated WLS or undertaken it already, I feel safe talking to others who know how I am feeling right now.   Sent off for tickets to come to the annual conference in November and booked a hotel room, just watch it all coincide with my OP LOL...   Still not told anyone my plans yet .. Very hesitant about sharing what I am about to do .. Maybe I fear that people will try and talk me out of it .. or look down on me for taking up the surgeons time whether privately or on the NHS ..I still feel this is a very private journey and that I will tell people in my own good time.. Probably when I am losing weight and they begin to ask how etc.   It is almost a month now since I made the decision that I was going to have WLS, it took me two weeks to pluck up the courage to go and see the GP again after my earlier refusal, then I had to wait two weeks for the appointment .. now it seems as if it is going to be all systems go. I have told my GP that I want the op to be done in October or November as I am really busy in September being a fat bridesmaid then going on holiday to Zante at the end of the month .. so I figure October will be a good month .. I will hopefully also be well enough to begin the uni course I am planning to start in January without having to miss any actual days in uni.&nbsp;   My emotions at the moment are really positive, I am happy, excited and really looking forward to the future .. Daft thing is I always used to go to bed and to help me relax think nice thoughts .. usually about retiring to the sunshine etc .. now its when I am post op!&nbsp; I am sure I will experience a variety of emotions as the op date gets closer .. I remember how I felt in the days leading up to my wedding (3 years ago) ecstatic one day and balling my eyes out the next!&nbsp; My hubby to be kept me well supplied with Bach rescue remedy and weekends away where wedding talk was banned.. I can see him carrying out the same sort of role as the weeks unfold .. bless him.   Right now going to bore you anymore .. will come back to my blog next week.

      Today, I have been very busy at work, but have found my mind drifting all the time, weighing up all the info I absorb yesterday.  I feel extremely positive, and have decided I am definitely going this route .. and will be very determined next week when I see the GP.  If he is not very positive I shall be asking for a private referral.  My husband and I spoke at length last night about this and he realizes that this will mean so much to me.  We talked a little about his fears and the what if's!  I explained to him that without this I fear for my own future and to me that is a huge what if!  I also explained that I would have a much better quality of life and would be able to do so much more, like the ironing for example, as I currently find it too much to stand at the ironing board for any length of time.  Simple stuff! yeah but I just cant manage it.  Anyway I think he realises that I mean business and he now wants to attend a support group with me so that he can talk to others and get a better idea of what it will mean for us both.  Part of me wonders if he is worried that I will change post op .. but I know I will still be the same person inside.  I have decided not to tell people I am having this surgery as for me my weight has always been a very private issue .. yeah I am fat, people can see I am fat, but it is not a topic I care to discuss openly.  I was married for over 2 years before I told my husband how much I actually weigh.  So to date, my husband and best friend are the only people I have confided in .. apart from everyone reading this of course.  I shall decide what to tell work nearer the time.  My parents will try and talk me out of it, so I will not tell them until either immediately before or after .. again another decision to be made at a later date.

      I have for some time been struggling with my weight and health.  I have yo yo dieted most of my adult life, and as a result I am now heavier than I have ever been before.    Last summer I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which led me to re-examine my lifestyle.  I initially did lots of research on the web regarding managing my condition without medication, and for a couple of months followed a low carb approach to eating.  After a few weeks of settling into the this way of eating, I felt great and my blood sugars began to stabilize. My GP however went nuts when he realised what I was doing and told me I needed to re-introduce the carbs back into my diet.  I am now on two types of medication for my diabetes along with meds for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  The good news is however that my blood pressure is better now than it has been in about 10 years, and my cholesterol is down from 5.5 to 3!  The bad news is that the 2 stone I lost on the low carb approach to eating has now gone back on with a but extra.  This brings me to where I am at this point in my life.  I have for a while been thinking about weight loss surgery, and have done some intensive research over the last week or so, found a wonderful web resource wwww.wlsinfo.co.uk  which is a must for anyone considering weight loss surgery (WLS).  There is a really supportive forum which provides the peer support and guidance which I believe will be invaluable over the coming months.  My first step on my journey has been made already by locating this resource and reading up on all my options and arming myself with all the facts and findings ready to share with my GP.  I made a previous comment to the GP I see for my diabetes about wanting to find out more about WLS and he laughed openly in my face and said no way would I be considered.  I meet the criteria for NHS funding!  So I have now made another appointment to see my own GP on the 23rd July 2004.  Through the research I have done to date I believe the lap band will be my best option, as it is less invasive, and because diabetics have difficulty with healing time, the less invasive approach makes sense. However I will listen to what any experts in WLS have to say on this matter upon consultation.  My husband Ricky, is a little hesitant about the thought of my undertaking such a big step.  He says he loves me as I am .. but if he loves me as I am surely he will want me to be healthier and happier with myself than I am right now.  Rick lost his first wife age 39 to a viral infection and I can understand his reservations, but I also want him to understand that one of the reasons I wish to have the WLS is so that my life expectancy is increased and my quality of life much improved.  We have three wonderful grandchildren, I want to be able to get down on the floor and play with them, run with them to the park, be there to see them grow up.  I also want to grow old with Rick by my side. It took me years to find my soulmate and life partner after a very unhappy marriage that lasted 19 years.  My ex husband led me to believe that because I was fat I was not desirable, and I would never find another man to love me, etc etc and looking back on the 19 years I was with him I now realise that every time I started a diet he would in some way or another sabotage it, which then became the norm for me after a couple of months of dieting. A vicious circle. I finally made the break and filed divorce papers on my 40th birthday in 1998.  I met Rick in Feb 2000 and we married in June 2001, and we are very happily married and very much in love.  We have three wonderful adult children between us, Gavin my son is now 23 and my two stepdaughters are Louise age 22 who is mummy to Perry and Lizzy and Michelle aged 25 who is mummy to Evie.  I have a job that I really enjoy, I work within the social care field as a family placement social worker and my main field of work is with disabled children. So as you can see every other aspect of my life is going very well, if only I could get my weight sorted and in turn my health everything would be totally hunky dory!!!  I intend to use this blog as a way of recording my feelings and thoughts about the prospect of the WLS and also as a diary of my day to day life.
