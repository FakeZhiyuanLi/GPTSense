      My baby boy's first day of pre-K was so exciting...to me anyway...lol.  Of course he was excited too, but for me...oh my goodness, he's really growing up!  I had to take pictures going inside this morning, in typical "mommy" style.  Now if he'd only had a perfect day, it would've been complete.  But nooo, he has to go and play in the water and soak his shirt, because "all my friends were playing too".  So he ended up in minor trouble.  But it could've been way worse.  And he made my day when we got home.  Sometimes kids do little things that let you know that as much as you fuss at them, they really are listening.  We stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few things.  Normally, I take everything in the house when we get home, but I let the boy carry one bag...you know, give him just a lil responsibility.  But of course he complains...every single time.  Today, though, I didn't give him anything to carry, I just sent him towards the door... he asked me "Mommy, you don't want me to carry anything?"  I was so happy..he actually does know he's supposed to help out!!!  Yea!!!...I am a good mommy...LOL  Sometimes its the little things that give you pleasure.

      I have to wonder why it is that people in general, but men specifically, don't appreciate a good thing sitting in their face until it is gone. And I don't mean just a good partner in a relationship. Even being a good friend goes underapprciated these days. I got a voicemail from a guy I had been involved with earlier in the year, we'll call him the "crazy one". We had been dating off and on for about 3 months or so. And the entire time, I knew  something  wasn't right but could never really put my finger on it. He was one of those very charming guys, was really fun to be around (at first glance anyway). But he had a habit of not returning my calls, and being unavailable at "normal" hours. On top of that, he starting having trouble with the law. Now, I'm a "ride or die chick"; I'll stick by a good man going through a hard time; hell, I would want the same from a friend or mate or whatever. But the combination of his "unavailabilty", plus his accumulation trouble, and his lack of attention AND his evolving negative attitude eventually pushed me away. So it's now been about 3 months and every 2 weeks, religously, he calls me. I have long since stopped answering my phone when he calls because our separation wasn't exactly "pretty". Every message is the same: " I miss you, I want to see you, Lets take the kids out, Lets go eat". it's amazing to me the things that you are offered when you don;t give aperson any attention. I couldn't get the time of day from him when we were involved...oh but  NOW ... now you know who I am, and want to come around. Not happenin' buddy...take your negativity elsewhere.  And I say this not, while admitting that I have been NOT perfect in this area myself. I just broke my neck myself last night to see a very good friend of mine (we'll call him Babyface) who is going back to school this weekend. He and I were involved for a good part of last year, although completely long distance. Our realtionship kinda died out towards the end of the year, but we're still real cool. Anyway, once I moved back here, I was happy to know that in the summer we would get to kick it. He came home in mid-May and we hung out twice. And I haven't seen him since. And that is of my own fault, I confess. I wasn't really calling him, hadn't really invited him over and wasn't really returning his calls...I know I'm a damn hypocrite. I ran into him at D&amp;B two Fridays ago and he told me when he was going back to school and I just went crazy.  Now look who's calling who trying to get in some last minute QT...lol  We kicked it last Friday and last night and said our lil goodbyes. I'll miss him and I know that I won't slack on our time with each again. I have so few men around me that I can call real "friends" that I know have to appreciate them more. Especially since out of the 5 men that I do call "friend" only one live here in Atl right now.

      Yesterday, I had not 1, not 2, but  3  positive situations happen. It's rare I have more than one positive thing happen all in one day. I'm wondering if I should be scared for today.  Positive encounter #1: Ran in to the ex outside the building at work on my morning break. Considering I'm not a happy camper before about 11am, I was prepared for some type of run-in with him. He had this look on his face that is screaming "I'm beyond pissed, so really don't feel like fucking with you right now". So I am surprised as hell when he walks right up to me and gives me a hug. And not just a "hey how ya doing, how ya been" hug. Oh no, this is a "I need something cause life is shit right now" hug. Now mind you, we are standing smack in the middle of the doorway to get into the building. I'm thinking to myself  "Why are you doing this right here, right now, can we please move!"  But, I don't say anything. Turns out he was just having a crappy day with office politics (this place isn't all people think it is) and just needed consolation. How   I   became this source of support, I don't really know, but I listened anyway, cause I'm not  that  mean (well not always anyway). Now considering all of this happened from someone how a week ago, probably was considering putting a hit out on me so he could take our son back...this this was a major turning point. I get back to my desk and surprise number 2 - he has instant messaged me telling me that despite what I've done, he can't help but to forgive me because of his love for me. I'm reading this thinking "OMG...there is a God" How much more thankful can I be to know that our dispute over the boy is finally over...3 weeks earlier than I anticipated. Ahh, can the day get any better?  Positive encounter #2: A girlfriend of mine invited me to go a lil social networking event with her on Friday. Normally, thats no big deal..I'm usually invited to stuff. But  this  friend isn't just any friend. I only recently gained back the ability to call her  anything at all  much less my friend. This is a friend that I broke "girl's rule number 1" with. Yeah, I did it. I got involed with her "ex" (who I later found out wasn't exactly her ex after all). At the time it happened, I was going through my separation from the "ex" and I used the excuse that she had not always been such a good friend to me, and we weren't on "that" level of friendship, so her man was not off limits to me. None of those we're good excuses, then or now. What's worse is that, once it came to light, I felt terrible about it. I don't usually do things I regret...if I did it, I meant it. Even getting married...I don't and will never regret. But this, doing what I did to her...I will always regret. I realized how much of a friend she actually was to me when I destroyed our relationship. Now, 2 years later, upon my moving back to Atl, we were able to sit down one night at dinner just just let everything out. The hows, the whys, and most importantly, the "I'm sorrys". What is forgiveness? When a woman can forgive another woman for doing the unspeakable. It meant more to me than I can explain for her to not only accpet my apology but to forgive me as well. So for us to kick it,  and her to have actually invited me ...a sista is still on a high!  Positive encounter #3: There is so much more to sexy than the physical. Intelligence, aspiration, motivation...that's sexy to me. And so is originality. The worst thing about dating is the constant "getting to know you" questions. I just like to spend time just talking and getting a feel for a person, not spending 2 hours anwering question after question. Anyway, the current guy I've been getting to know (we'll call him SC), for about a month or so now, asked me one of the most original questions I've been asked in quite a while. My answer to "how was you day?" is usually "pretty good, could been better, could been worse". Mostly because I don't like to dwell on the negative...I just push it aside and keep on going. SC asked me in response to my answer, "what could've been better about it?" LOL, can we say I was  totally  taken aback by that! I've never had anyone actually show an interest in what happened during my day and what was bad about it. So I was more than shocked, most pleasantly I must say. I shared with him the little things that were bad about the day, and we continued our convo from there. Talking to him is always refreshing. We always have "interesting, out of the norm" conversations. And I have yet to like he's coming at me just for the physical. Its going to be interesting to see how this one plays out...most guys don't make it past 2 weeks...he's been around and  still  holding my interest for over a month now.

       And once again we have another one. Do guys just see it differently or am I just odd? When I'm interested in someone...and it's so rare that I am...I pick up the phone and call just to say "hey, you were on my mind". Yet, if I do this, I may get you on the phone maybe 85% of the time.  great, thats cool with me.  HOWEVER, my voicemails seem to go unreturned for a day or two. Hmm, so now I'm thinking "you're not interested after all". Cool, no prob...I can certainly take a hint. I'm not calling you if you aren't interested..I'm interested, not desperate. Now after a week, you call, wondering why you haven't heard from me. Come on, what is that about? Do guys have a different way of showing their interest? I'm mean, I know you don't like talking on the phone...truth be told, I'm not much of a phone person myself. But I do understand that if I don't call, you don't know you crossed my mind. So looking in the reverse...yeah I'm gonna think the same thing. Damn, once again..I just don't get it.

      The ex called to our son (who will from this point be reffered to as "the boy"...yes we actually call him that...lol) tonight.  As always, they had a great conversation.  Kinda hard to have a bad convo with a 4 year old though.  Anyway, the ex actually asked to speak to me!  He hasn't had more than 2 words for me since I moved the boy back home with me last weekend.  Boy was I shocked!  I didn't expect much more than the basics for months  (if that much at all) , the way he carried on about me "taking the boy from him".  It wasn't about  "taking him";  it was, as it has always been, putting  the boy's  best interests above and beyond our own.  We can't always be his "friend" and his "parent" at the same time.  I don't think the ex ever caught onto that in the 5 months the boy was living there.  I never wanted to hurt the ex's feelings, depsite his cursings on me.  I have forgiven and moved along from that chapter in my life, and getting back at him wouldn't serve me any purpose...especially trying to use the boy to do it...that's just   trifling  .  Anyway, it was  almost  nice to have a respectable convo, without the hostility.  Now he  "said"  he's gonna get the boy this weekend so he can visit with his baby sister and step brother...let's see if he carries that one out.
