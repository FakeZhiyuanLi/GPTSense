      Had a chat with the  Ex  earlier today. She really is good people. Breaking up is weird. That's it. I have nothing profound to say about it beyond that simple fact. I've been thinking about our conversation for the better part of the day. Not to find any hidden meaning or figure out if I could have possibly phrased something differently but more, I think, because i just miss having conversations with her so I keep replaying this one.  Anyway. I was actually planning to write something about a conversation I was having with  Mistah Lovah Lovah  about aging and solitude vis a vis loneliness but now that I'm here I'm just not up to it.

       and the winner is...  By the way, the winner for the  BEST  phrase I have heard all month goes to {drumroll, please}  Mr. Sir J  who, just this morning, uttered these fateful words:  "...the rest of the panty tasks were washed away during the kayaking portion of the race."   This will either be the  name of my next band  or the  title of my next book  depending on which career I get moving on first.

       Finally...!  It is  about time  someone finally spelled out what exactly is  urlLink appropriate  for me (a woman) to wear. Thank you,  urlLink Robyn  for the link. You have no idea what a huge weight this is off my mind... (Keep going through to the "next slide" -- for those of you with a limited imagination they go ahead and dress up some mannequins  like the sluts they are  to illustrate the "don'ts".)

       A moment of silence for Kate   ....    Katherine Hepburn ,  urlLink dead at 96 . World mourns.  Kudos to you  Katie ! You were an inspiration, a goddess and an ass-kicking chick at a time when it didn't exactly pay to be different. Rest in Peace. You rock!    Well, it would appear that our little  Angel  became a man last night! We are just sooo proud. I don't have all the details yet because  someone  has yet to call me (probably still all snuggled up cute mongst the  sweat-stained "love-sheets" ) {heart}.... yay! Good going! Nicely done and all that. And, also, while I'm on the subject and because  someone asked , the  background  on the  two boys  who are rather suddenly in my life is as follows:  A long time ago when I was a tweenie living in  Albu-turkey, New Mexico  (yes, we have the same money) we lived in a house in the  Heights  (which, for those of you  not  from ABQ, is where the  upper-middle class  folks lived. We lasted about two years before moving to the  South Valley  where the  hair was bigger  and everybody had  a pool in their backyard ; it was called the  Rio Grande !)  Anyway, I was friends with  two sisters  who lived across the street from me (they had a  Barbie townhouse  and  two  parents. I was a bit put off by the sheer excess of this arrangement but live and let live, I say.) These sisters and I spent a whole lot of time running away from their  bratty, snot-nosed, little brother  who was, I think,  3 or 4 years old  and  who spent  all his time  trying to put his  filthy, grubby  little kid hands  all over  our stuff. Long story short, we moved. I lost track of the sisters.   About a year ago my mom ran into one of them and mentioned that I was a big  rock star/web designer/ theatre critic/ doing Something-with-computers  out here in  Cali  and passed along my digits. Fast forward to three or four months ago, I'm minding my own biz-ness when suddenly, from out-of-the-blue, as they like to say, these two 20-somethings sashay into my life armed only with  skateboards  and  scraps of paper  with some kind of mostly illegible writing on them. I'm the only one they could track down (Yay, me!) so it has since become my  joy  and my  burden  to  shepard these youth  as they traverse the  modern Gomorrah , making sure that they bypass  actual harm  while still managing to have as much fun as is humanly possible and to get laid a lot!  Now, those of you  paying attention  might by now have put two and two together (like i  finally  did last night) and come up with the fact that  technically , by screwing around with  Dirty Boy  I am messing with   my friend's little brother   which is not just wrong, it's  gross . And, I gotta say, I'm right there with ya. It took me a  minute to get there (I'm telling you,  all the drugs  are just beginning to kick in) but, rest assurex, I'm there. As far as I'm concerned this is just a big ole  slippery slope  and if I don't  nip it in the bud  now it's only a matter of time before a 20 year old  Boo  is screaming at me to leave her friends alone! {Shudder} K. No more of that. From this day forth I am a socially responsible, upstanding, dating- within -my-generation citizen. Promise.

       Ex-Gay?  Spent the week-end being  out  and  proud . Well, kind of proud, mostly just  out . First  me  and  Boo  went  old school on the Volvo  (not sure why it didn't occur to me that we could always just drag out a  hose  and a  bucket of suds  and spend as many hours as we wanted scrubbing in the sun  last  week-end but hey, I don't get paid to  think ...!) Anyways, by the end of our washing experience we were both  very wet  and  very silly  and it didn't cost a damn thing! take that, Carwash Man!!   Then,  feeling like we got away with something ,  me  and  Boo  went to the  Dyke March  to meet up with the  CP  and eventually with the  Miss Bee/Ms.B  contingent. Even ran into the  Best Friend  and her  fabulous Entourage  toward the end of the eve which was unexpected and therefore even  more  special.   Today [Sundee], dropped the kid off with  CP   then, having been ditched  again  by  Emerson  (who, as he  is trying to get his life together , is officially excused) wandered around the  Civic Center  with the rest of the out and proud listening to country music and trying not to buy  some really cool surgical steel jewelry  which would have necessitated a piercing in places that have  suffered enough abuse . Instead i got a  very fancy pinky ring  which sports the single word that pretty much sums up  everything I hope to become . [as an aside, and for the record, when I mentioned the  new ring  to  Dirty Boy  his response was " what's it say:  'F*cked'?! " It  actually  says " Princess " thank you very much!  DB = prick ]     Notwithstanding the snottiness, and  having nothing better to do with my life , I ended up going over to  Chez DB  where we sat on the couch and watched  urlLink Snatch  on his big screen. Oh, and I  may  have tried to kiss the bastard. For the continuing record, he wouldn't let me  but get this ...   { *alert*  the following may very well be " too much information " for some of you readers out there who think of me as the  sister  you  never had . If descriptions of PG-13  humiliation  and  naughtyiness  vis a vis the  Chickster  and another consenting adult ooge you out, then  urlLink click here  instead to go to a site that  not only  champions a very good cause but which actually  makes a hell of a lot of sense  in terms of a workable global solution to ending hunger. Good folks. Give them money.}  So, we're sitting there and the movie is over and  DB  has  just  said I can't kiss him [saving himself for  Other Girl  I guess.] and we end up having the following conversation:   Chick : Damn. Now I have a headache.  Dirty Boy : You know how you get rid of headaches?  Chick : How?  DB : You have to get the blood re-directed away from your head.  Chick : What?  DB : Re-directed.  Chick : How the hell do you do that?  DB : Like this...{scoots over to my side of the couch and starts unbuttoning my pants}  I am  not  kidding.  This  is the boy who earlier in the evening would have  nothing to do with my top half  because he's saving himself for  marriage  or something and now, thirteen minutes later , he trying to send  the finger family  South for a little recon! I, of course, was incensed, appalled and not just a little  indignant . I didn't make him  stop  or anything cause,  Christ , the guy is talented and his hand felt  really  good, but  still  (!!) What  is  it with boys and their  complete inability  to follow  the accepted rules of engagement ??     So, as I was saying,  urlLink Snatch , the movie. Good flick.  Guy Ritchie  has got one hell of an eye for the good-looking boys, i'm telling ya. I don't know what kind of  arrangement  him and the Madone have but he could have been the poster child for the  2000 Pride parade . Check out the  five minute faux jerk-off session  in  urlLink Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  with the beautiful boys suddenly deciding to drown each other in seltzer. Christ! If that's not  homerotic , I don't know what is. Anyways....      All of this brings me back to my original point which is that I have no idea if I am even  still gay . I was surrounded by  close to a thousand  of the world's  freshest females  most of whom were sporting  neon  signs stating that they were, in fact, " bent " and the hottest  I  got was over  some dragqueen  playing keyboards in a band called   urlLink PepperSpray  . (Speaking of which, if anyone knows the band and can get close to " Peg " could you ask him if he needs a  wife/girlfriend/groupie/decent web designer  and give him my number?)   I mean, I know I  don't want a girlfriend  right now. I'm  pretty  sure (despite all the recent activity) that I  don't want a boyfriend either , so where does that leave me? I can't even  pretend  to be  politically Lesbo  since the one extended encounter I had with an  actual  female I spent all my time  rolling my eyes  while she tried to convince me to go cheer for some chick because she was going to get boo-ed because she had won some contest and some people thought she shouldn't have won cause she was " currently  heterosexually partnered"... blah, blah, blah. I mean, c'mon! " Currently Heterosexually Partnered "? What  is  that?? Anyway. I'm not  political  anymore. I'm never going to have  real sex  with a girl ever again and the  vast majority  of my tingly feeling are being caused by the male side of the species... I'm beginning to see why  real   Rug-munchers  are so afraid of us  Bi-chicks . Couldn't make up our damn minds if our lives depended on it. In the interest of  honest reporting  though, I  do  have to say I got a  slight buzz  from some gal who stopped to inquire if I had any  aspirin .  CP  claims i blushed and threw a sidelong glance or two after the lady in question. I maintain that   Miss CP  is still recovering from  all the drugs  she did in the  late eighties  and as such is  not  the most reliable witness but, I will admit I  may  have been  somewhat  intrigued.   At any rate, the sun stayed  mostly out  and the  week-end stayed  mostly good . I give it a six overall. I'm tired now, though. And my head still hurts.

       Down among the washed  Once again, was riding the train of the  well-scrubbed  today and I noticed something.  Nobody pays to ride the N . I mean nobody. (Except  me  but I'm not  well-scrubbed .) It was weird. People were getting on  multiple entrances , there was an occassional  mad dash  followed by a triumphant  swoop aboard ;  backpacks were adjusted , people  amiably shifted   around to make room but  nobody  put  any  money into the coinbox. And  nobody  showed a fastpass. At first i didn't really think to much about it until I saw a girl get on,  pause by the fare box , pull out her wallet, discover she had no singles then, with  complete unconcern , she replaced her wallet, pulled out her phone and began to make a call. I'm not kidding. People were treating the farebox like  a cup being passed  after the  silver guy  stops moving.  One lady got on with her kid and made a  HUGE  deal about her child putting  35 cents into the box  and getting a transfer. Everyone smiled. "How cute! She's  paying ." It was decidedly weird. It was weirder when I realized that it's possible these people don't pay because they know the odds of them getting harrassed in a "transfer, please" kind of way by the MUNI police are pretty slim. It's just  not that kind of line . I think there may be some sort of rule that the very clean don't need any other "proof-of-purchase." I could easily imagine every single person on that train (except me)  striding into some shop  on Irving street with a blouse -- no bag, no reciept, just the blouse -- crumpled in their hand, hoping to return it because it  just didn't fit right . And I bet it would work. I bet the  serious but concerned  salesperson would  take back that blouse  and not even check it for stains. I bet they'd take whatever card was handed to them and ring up the refund  including  the sales tax, smile at that customer and sincerely inquire whether or not "there would be anything else?". Weird.     There was a lady on the train today who was not so much a lady as she was  a watercolor sketch  of a lady. I don't think I've every seen someone so completely  drawn , if you know what I mean. Her  lines  were f***ing amazing! Anyway.  I couldn't stop staring at her. Another lady noticed me being fixated, glanced at the object of my attention then back at me. Then she shrugged and continued reading her million and six page  Harry Potter  book. "Not very well-scrubbed." She probably thought. "I'll bet she paid full fare." I don't care. I want to take that  watercolor lady  and  hang her in my livingroom . I think she'd go great with my couch.      Quick good-bye to some co-worker friends   Good-bye,  Andrew .  Michelle  and  Jim . I really enjoyed working/hanging out with you guys. It's people like you that make coming to work fun and I hope your next gigs are fulfilling and lucrative. Best of luck in the real world. Don't let the bastards get you down!!   I think I need coffee now. And another shower; only this time with sweet-smelling soap.

       A solution for you?  So, after much  back  and  forth , I finally ( finally ) got  Network Solutions  to forward my domain name to the Hayseed house. Type in " urlLink www.seriouslyinvolved.com " et voila! there you are at my temporary home page!! (Yay!)  BUT , I want the address in the little IE window at the top of the browser to continue saying "www.seriouslyinvolved.com" instead of having it display the re-routed path to Hayseed.net. Anyone got any ideas on how to make this happen?

       I want to have a nine-way with the Supreme Court!   Well, maybe a  6-way  because, now, apparently  urlLink it's  legal... How much  urlLink ass  is being kicked right now??    Alrighty, on to more important issues, like...  my  week-end. I'm guessing that now that we're allowed to be gay the festivities this coming Sat/Sun will be  off the hook ! which, leads us to our main concern of "what will I wear?" The  Escort  has informed me that he will be attired in  fading indigo jeans  and a " Lucy !" muscle T. He has further informed me that if I am not at least partially " all that " he will ditch me for the first person he sees who matches his outfit.  I do not care because he doesn't know that I'm leaving him to go watch  urlLink the Animatrix  (and possibly  urlLink Hedwig  with the fabulous  urlLink  Emerson   at noon. Hahahaha!!!) Sides, I don't really like the Sundee part of  urlLink Pride . It's always so  hot  and the boys are all so  Boy-ey ! Sat. though. It's all about the  urlLink Dyke march ! The fabulous  Miss Bee  has invited  Boo  and  I  to meet up with them in the park for a little potty-luck and some quality chick scoping. Given that it is  boiling  today, the odds that it will be  freezing  on Sunday are good.  Sat . however, may just be bearable. Mmmmmmmm, girls. Gotta love em.    Right. So, I  was  going to do today's posts as "literary critique" wherein I explore the  complex relationships  between the artist and her muse vis a vis the study of a series of  uncompromising yet superbly artful  reflections which are initially so varied that some may find it difficult to believe that they were penned by the same author. The ambition of that particular undertaking, however, would have produced an  unwieldy masterpiece  that may have been heroic to some yet precisely because of that heroism, would have shown weaknesses to be more like  tragic flaws , defining qualities that we can lament but at the same time can't imagine this blog without. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that since this blog,  like everything else in our modern society  is essentially about love  and loss , it seemed redundant and cursory to even attempt  explication through words . That said, we now return you to our regular writing.    Back to the week-end... Looking forward to  urlLink Pride . In a  wierd mood  this morning though. I had  one of those dreams  about the  Ex  last night .  Damn ! Say what you want (not that there's that much  to  say since the  Ex  is really a very sweet person) but that girl was (and probably still is) hot! I find myself in a very interesting predicament here onna counta,  she  probably still hates me and while I couldn't really predict how a  surprise run-in  would go, I  do  know that everytime I've seen her in the past I tended to want to smile largely... all I'm sayin is, it's weird to think that should we  someday run into each other  on BART my reaction would be "{Big smile} Hey!" While hers would probably be "{stony face} Oh. Hey." Know what I'm saying? I guess I'm just not used to wanting to see someone who I made a conscious decision to not want to see.   K. nuff of that. Decisions were made. Lives were changed. Beds must be lied in. Moving along now. nothing to see here.     By the way,  this space   is  for rent. So, if anyone wants to post any notices or advertise anything feel free to drop me a line and we'll work out the logistics. That said:   Wanted:   " Daddy  for medium height, super-cute, skateboarding  boy toy . Must be willing to drive me around and buy me stuff. Will reciprocate by being extremely witty,  hot in bed  and adoring in public. Extremely well-built ( extremely !), but on the skinny side. Not afraid of commitments. Send all responses to  Angel  via Chick's e-mail."  [O.K. so  Angel  didn't really say any of this but I know he wants to. C'mon boys, let's  step lively  here. I want to get this kid  laid by July 4th !)

      The phone call wasn't anything, more news about nothing, but it started Chick thinking about phone calls in general. Like why people who you didn't want to call you back did and people who you did, didn't. Chick was missing people. She missed T and the Boy. She missed her old friends who were settled into lives that didn't have room for her. She even missed people who she hadn't technically lost. Like Q. Chick had left a few messages on her best friend's voicemail and received a few messages in return. The feeling was definitely mutual; that they should talk, get together, share stories, but no time was set. There were scheduling conflicts, deadlines - on both sides. Chick understood but it still made her sad. "I'm just hungry. I should probably eat." Chick decided, checking the time. "Or I'm about to bleed." She ammended, checking her datebook. A friend pinged her to check on the lunch situation. "Let's take care of the hunger first." Chick decided, getting up to go. "We'll deal with the gut-wrenching cramps later."

       A new leaf  It has been brought to my attention that I am " too Victorian " in my writings. As someone who not only  welcomes  but actively encourages criticism (constructive or otherwise) I have decided that today's postings will be  Hemingwayesque . I'm not sure if this is the start of  a grand tradition  (p'raps tomorrow I'll channel  Dave Eggers  -- nah, I'm not that cool. Anyway...)  but it's  what the people want  and as such, it is  what the people shall get !    It was usually pretty quiet around the cube. That is unless the dolls started talking. Then it got loud. The subdued yet constant  chat  like pigeons not quite sure if they're ready to roost but at the same time unwilling to call it a night. The dolls were quiet now. Waiting. Watching. Chick noticed that one of them was having a hard time making eye contact. Chick didn't care. She was used to the silence. The quiet, accusing "we 'belong' to you?!" that hovered in the air between her (to them anyway) grotesque typing humanity and their painted vinyl perfection. The question was mostly unspoken but acknowledged nonetheless.  Chick surveyed the landscape. She played with her stapler for a minute, just to teach the dolls a lesson, then glanced at her to-do list. There was only one thing on it that she was actually interested in. The rest she considered "busywork". In the grand scheme of things, Chick supposed, it was all "busywork." Chick had some more coffee. Boss #3 pinged her with a query. Chick liked Boss #3. She thought he was smart. There were others in the office who were beginning to warm up to him as well. To appreciate his slighty skewed yet methodical coding. Chick was secure in  her  fondness though. After all, she had liked him first.   " Move buttons to SourceSafe " she read aloud from the list. Chick wondered what would happen if she didn't move the buttons. What if her OS decided to take a holiday and she lost her life's work, or worse, the client's files? Chick sighed and sat back. She missed her kid. Wednesdays were the worst. Nothing but work, cats, and sleep between her and her 5:30 pick-up the next day. 5:30 on Thursdays. That's when her life began again. This? This "in-between" time?  This  was busywork. "I've discovered a theme for my life!" she announced to the dolls but they'd stopped listening. Chick took another swig of coffee. There was a bake sale going on in the kitchen. Chick's contribution had been two pans of brownies. Now she wondered if maybe she shouldn't have left one of the batches at home, so she could eat it tonight. While she waited on the couch, with the cats, for the day to finally be over.

      Why o' why  don't I live in  LA  ?? Oh right, I hate it down there. But that was " used to be "!  Now  there's all this cool stuff going on  re:   urlLink Grease 2  'n sheet!! Thanks to the fabulous  urlLink Miss Diva  (friend  extraordinaire  to the always vivacious  urlLink Jason !) for this  urlLink link . I love her because she was a part of that  magical night  and because she says she'll let me know when they're going to do it again next year!    In other news,  Pretty Boy  got a  urlLink car . This is  only funny  if you happen to know the boy in question and you know that he's gotta be like  30  at this point and has  never owned a car in his damn life  or even had his license for that matter! O.K. maybe not funny, haha....    Then there's the part where we're all standing around talking and I laugh/ sneeze  and  snot  shoots out of my nose while the uber chivarous  Sir J  and  Tony  continue the conversation as if nothing untoward has just happened. Christ, I am  nothing  if not suave!

       2 old 2 B Hootchie?  On my way to work this morning I happened to pass by my favorite store of all time; a little boutique called  Ragmatazz . Upon glancing in, I spied, there in the lower left side of the store display, a pair of  pink, seude, velcro tennies . I began to salivate. beads of sweat dotted my brow. I feverishly checked the hours of business and considered the feasibility of  hanging around outside  for close to two hours until the manager arrived so I could explain my situation and perhaps get her to do  one  pre-sale...just one,  please .... while I was thus captivated, a  largish woman  who appeared to be mid-forties, possibly fifty arrived on the scene with a set of keys. She saw me staring hungrily at the shoes and hopefully at her and laughed. "I'm just going into the side office" she remarked, "but those are nice. I have a pair." she nodded and winked and went on her way.   O.K. Here's the thing.  Me  liking the shoes? Cool. Fresh. Contemporary with just a hint of youthful whimsy, dare, i say, even slightly Fly.  Her  liking the shoes?? I dunno. She seemed very nice and all that but she was just so... old . When I was a twenty-nothing I worked at a "vintage" clothing store in the Haight called the  Wasteland . I'm not gonna say we copped tude or anything but we were sort of expected to be  half an hour beyond whatever was going on right now  and we did act somewhat superior about it. Thing is, I remember these old ladies coming in (like  35-40 !) with all this money and their newly lifted bodies buying stacks of stuff and (I'm not ashamed to say it) these women were regarded with  just a trace of pity . Back to me. now. I want those shoes. I like  Forever 21  dammit! I  try  to dress like a rebrobate. Granted not at work (usually) and not nearly to the extent that I did - back when the body was a bit more, shall we say...  slammin' . But what does this make me?? Have I become  one of them ? I've already accepted the fact that I'm going to embarrass my kid(s) Will this be my area of annoyance? (Interestingly enough,  my mom  has been known to throw togther an enemble that  makes her accessories cringe  and throughout my growing years, I've at times wondered why she " couldn't just dress like a normal mom "... eh hem... realizing, of course, that that has  NOTHING  to do with this post, so... moving along...) I don't think I'm an embarrassment  yet ... My friends are still,  for the most part , willing to hang out with me. But... (and here's the rub) even if I  was  pathetically clinging to  the styles of my youth ... I don't think I'd do anything about it. The one thing that makes sense to me as a 35 year old lady is that this is what I'm like. This is me. My hair won't grow longer than my shoulders, I will always scoff at {shudder}  green  food. I wear ripped clothes. I like old books bound with leather bindings and I love my kid's shoes. I'll age out of the other mid-twenties stuff (no more drama if it can be avoided, and definitely no more staring at someone for three hours in a club waiting for them to come talk to me then going home alone. In fact, no more clubs period. Clubs suck.) but the clothes thing... Nah. To all those ladies I snickered at back in my Wasteland days,   a heartfelt apology  . You go, my fashion-sistahs -- You're  never  to old to be Hootchie!    So, I participated in this  urlLink survey  last night. It took fifty million years to complete but it  was  interesting to see the sort of  methodology  utilized by our  United states Governmental  fact finding agencies.   [alert:  Grad school  geeking out ahead. If you're eyes begin to glaze over, skip to the  next section . It's got  puppies ...]   First off, the materials were in  English  and  Spanish . There are apparently no readers of any other  ethnic flavor  that our government is interested in.  Filipino ? nah, thanks all the same.  Russian ? Nope. Sorry. I found this interesting. Also interesting was the fact that  the guy conducting the survey  had to  read each question  (and all the responses) out loud. He  had  to. I tried interrupting a few times (for instance when the answer I wanted to give was listed  first ) but was informed that "all the answers  must be read  in case there is a more appropriate one in the list."  I also realized that  I suck at math . A part of the survey involved deciphering ad content. For instance: if a pillow is typically 12.99 but is on sale for 9.99 and you have a 10% off coupon, how much will you end up paying? huh? In real life i just hand over a twenty but  that's not gonna cut it  as far as the  United States Government  is concerned!   There were some great, questions about children's reading too. "Do you read more than 15 minutes a day to your school-age child?", "Does your child see you reading - often, sometimes, seldom, not at all?" Oh! and the best part was the end where I got to read made-up words. I dunno what they're checking with that but i gotta tell ya, who knew simply reading the word " floom " off a card could make a person so smiley??   Anyways, interesting experience. I highly recommend to anyone who is approached for (non-incriminating) data that they tell all.  Everything in our world is based on numbers  and the more of us out there adding to the national statistics the less likely (I would hope) it will be that truly evil things (like library closures in poorer neighborhoods) get suggested.    Puppies!!

       urlLink This  apparently happened last week-end. My so-called  urlLink friend  down in L.A. went but neglected to inform me. {sigh} see... thing is, I sooooo thought my back was had... {shake head. won't. let. them. see. me. cry. quietly going back to work...}

       Standing up to be counted...  Er... ah... I mean  sitting down ! So, I've been selected to participate in a  nationwide survey  regarding adults and reading. I received a brochure in the mail (which I promptly tossed into my  oft cleaned ,  never smelly  kitchen gar-bage receptacle) then Friday eve  this guy  comes around with a  sheaf  of papers asking if I am, in fact, the person living in ... blah, blah, blah and if i could answer a few questions. Suffice to say, I , like most of my  fellow Americans  probably would not  have even opened  the door had I known who this person was and what he represented but, since I did, I felt it behooved me to invite him the hell in. Long story short, The ole  US  of  A  is trying to get a feel for "adult reading patterns" and I ( I ) get to represent my block! Whoo Hoo!  Jane Eyre , in the house, yo! Anyway, this, as with most things, started with " a few questions " yet quickly became " I'll come over Monday evening for  2 hours  and ask you every imaginable question I can dream up about the ways in which you fancy yourself literate ." {sigh} I mean, I suppose it's for  the good of the country  or something but what about  Seinfeld ? ... Speaking of which, I went ahead and assumed from the  sheaf  and the standard issue laptop that ole  Jim Ferguson  [6'2'', Caucasian male, early 50's, clean-shaven with greying hair] was  not  a serial killer but, in the event that I  fail to post tomorrow , go to my house and  check the crawlspace . Oh,  and feed the cats . If, by chance, I'm not in the crawlspace and am instead someplace more easily accesible ( like under the bed ) I don't want them lunching on my remains.

       Huh?  Excuse me but what the  urlLink hell ?!  Speaking of which (40ish years young musician attempts to re-package herself as 20-something popstar -- news at 11:00!) I was talking to  my kid  yesterday and she mentioned that she " hates it when her leg gets fat ." (!!) Upon further questioning it was revealed that "fat" is what happens when you're sitting and your thigh becomes "soft". To better illustrate (perhaps because she took my look of  extreme shock tinged with dismay  to mean I wasn't quite  understanding  what she was trying to tell me)  Boo  began poking various parts of her gymnast-tone,  five-year-old  body and saying "See! It's squishy." I, quite simply, was and am at a loss. Again, I  know  that this happens and I  know  that our society markets these images of unnaturally thin body types to increasingly younger girls... blah, blah, blah, but  c'mon!  5 years old???   5  ?!! {sigh} I, of course, tried to disguise my chagrin by pointing out that 1) muscles get "soft" when they are in thier relaxed state and that's what helps them stay flexible and stretchy and 2) I, myself, had some  squishy bits  that, just so happened to be among Boo's favorite places to snuggle when she needed some comfort and/or a rest and that these bits were actually quite cute, especially when we poked them and they jiggled.  she (grudgingly, I think) accepted this second line of reasoning but still.... What the hell are we doing to our girls??????

       Hullo, Happy, happyies!  I'm in a  fabulous  mood today. Had a splenderific week-end and all is right with the world (for now.  breath is  not  being held...)  Me  and  Boo  spent Sat. rolling around  Frisco  like the  big-shots  we are. First, went for a casting call/photo-shoot thing at  Fort Mason  -- they're looking for people to be in an insurance ad. How sad has my life become that I am now stopped on the street and asked to participate in a casting call for  insurance ?? I think they just wanted my kid anyway. I'll have to get used to that... -- at any rate, photo shoot was quick and fun.  Photographer guy  was nice and let  Boo  do bunny ears on me for one of the shots (which given that we were  numbers 398/399  respectively I gotta give him props for.) Then it was off to  Fisherman's warf  to be fabulous like the tourists only   better   because we know how much things are  supposed  to cost!  Sunglasses  were thrown on,  french fries  were eaten,  marionettes  were purchased -- I actually found  a decent parking space  so you  know  it was meant to be... Then home again, home again, to the happy abode.  Chick's  famous baked spaghetti for sup-sup and off to bed. {sigh} Life, she ees sweet.     Then, on Sunday...  breakfast ,   urlLink Finding Nemo   and thorough  scrub-down  of the old truck. I'd forgotten it used to be red. Anyways,  Finding Nemo  -  finally ! This was  Boo's  second time seeing it so she was very helpful and covered my eyes during all the scary bits. Very beautiful animation. Very sweet story. Nicely done,  Pixar ! Keep up the good work. Can I just say,  do-it-yourself carwash places  are becoming  SUCH  a rip! Sheesh. First you have to use their  stupid tokens  instead of real money which means you have to buy more than you probably need since you may need a tiny bit of extra time but not the  whole two minutes  extra.... And what's with the  two freakin' minutes ?? Who washes an entire car in  two minutes ?? Whatever. The spray gun is really fun so I will continue to go but sheesh, makes me mad.  Boo  was  a trooper  and a  huge  help both with the bubble brush and the after towel-down. Due entirely to her careful ministrations the lower half of my esteemed vehicle is spotless! Some  Shlub  (me) was in charge of the upper half so there are all these half-assed-dirt-re-distributed-into-circle marks but whatever! I can't be good at everything!!   Later that day:  dropped off  Boo  with the  CP  and, un-able to go ahead with  Plan A  (Hanging at the Hayseed house watching  urlLink the  Animatrix  -- the highly anticipated viewing having been mercilessly  re-scheduled  by   urlLink Emerson  ) I ended up down at  the Pier  watching  Dirty Boy  and  Angel  attack things with thier skateboards.  Other Girl  was there as well, so the two of us sat (her looking bored, me  being  bored) for a good  thirty minutes not talking to each other . Yipee! Betty Friedan would have been  thrilled !   This is Other Girl:    OG:  [early twenties, pink, pointy hair, "Emily's Cats" t-shirt with cut-off sleeves, oily jeans, converse high tops, studs in her ears, nose, tongue and belly button - to  Dirty Boy  whom she is rumoured to " like "] Hey!  DB:  [trying to slide across a pointed rectangular concrete thing on a foot long plank of wood without killing himself] What?!  OG:  When are we gonna f***??   DB:  [Misjudges some crucial something; slams board into tiny lip thing at end of concrete rectangle and lands on his back fairly close to where we are sitting] Ahhhhhh.....!  OG:  [Smiling tenderly down at him] Stupid.  O.K. so at this point I laugh. I  have  to! Apparently the site of  DB  bleeding goes a long way toward relieving any real or imagined animosity between  myself  and  Other Girl  and we begin to get along famously. For about an hour. Until her brother comes to pick her up.     O.K. so I have to take a moment here to do something that I am convinced is the right thing to do but which is painful for me nontheless. After much reflection ( and after having taken a quick look at the numbers ) I'm afraid I am going to have to rescind a pseudonym. I have decided that the  nom de blog  of  "Beautiful Boy"  is more a  title  than a permanent monniker and, as such, can be won or lost depending on the vagaries of fate and our esteemed panel of judges.  Not  to say that our former  Beautiful Boy  is no longer beautiful (I think of it like  the Presidency  or the  Miss America  pageant --  [you'll always be beautiful to me, man !]) but for the purposes of this blog,  Beautiful Boy  from earlier posts will henceforth be known simply as  Pretty Boy  (which is still  really ,  really  good!)  eh, hem...  Now then.  Other Girl's Brother . Oh Mi GAWD! Can we just say CUTE!!!!! Can we all take a collective moment to appreciate the sheer perfection that a human male can achieve (especially one with long brown hair, cafe au lait skin, the cutest teeth I've ever seen and a waist you just want to lick butter off of... well, maybe  YOU  might not want to but I guarantee it would be because of some wierd dietary restriction, NOT because the thought didn't occur to you.... Sweet! This  Beautiful boy  (you knew it was coming) comes riding up, throws himself down on the steps and proceeds to engage us in a chinwag (I say "us" in the metaphorical sense;  Other Girl  completely ignored him). I am  confused ,  captivated  and  delighted  all at the same time until, surprise, surprise, he suddenly glances at his watch, stands, and orders  OG  to " C'mon " as apparently they " gotta go meet, Mom. " Sorrow, Desolation. The sun may have chosen that moment to set.... {Sigh} Well, at least I know how to find him should I ever 1) turn straight, 2) need a daddy for my next baby 3) want to re-affirm my faith in all that is holy.

       Whew! That was close!  I came  this  close to thinking about posting something up here  before  going to get my special, free-trade, organic, picked by persons making more than 5 bucks per day, uber-aware mug o coffee with a shot of ghiradelli chocolate syrup on the side. Let's just say, I'm glad not only for  you , my obsessed public, but also for the rest of the relatively oblivious free world that I came to my senses and re-thought that misguided attempt at a decision!  Now then, where were we? [sip] Ah, yes, today's post. Today's post concerns familiarity vis a vis casual conversation.    Run-in #1 : On my way to pick up the kid yesterday, I notice  cute dyke  I recognize from days gone by (the strides in my confidence, BTW,  can be measured in miles as I neither  turned and ran ,   tripped over something tiny  on the sidewalk nor  forgot any names ) I made eye contact, I smiled, I nodded as I hurried past, intent as i was on getting into my truck and to my child waiting,  shivering alone in the cold  for me to  finally  show up. (Actually, by the time i arrived at the camp,  Boo  was happily empoyed doing an United States puzzle; perfectly toasty, eating an orange. I swear that kid needs me  not at all . Ah well, I will continue to cling to her until  she kicks me away  so she can ride unencumbered off into the sunset that is her grown up life.) At any rate,  this  run-in felt perfect. This is someone I know, whom I've spoken to on more than one occassion, whom I'm written a flirtatious note to now and again  but  (and this is key) this is  not  someone whose life I need to catch up on. Nor do I think she would  burst into flame  if she somehow missed hearing my hours long monologue re:  work, kid, school, second kid, work again ... blah, blah, blah. I know her, I like her, I may, at some point actually  want  to talk to her but for right now, I've more pressing issues to attend to.   I bring this up because  this morning  on the train I ran into one of my  Dad's ex-girlfriends . The fact that she was in San Francisco and not in  Phoenix  where last I saw her (albeit 15 years ago) was in and of itself shocking; add to that, the fact that she looks  exactly  the same as she did back then and you get into truly bizzare territory. So, there I am clutching my transfer, hanging onto the rail thing (essentially looming over her) squawking  "Dixie?"  The female in question glanced up and said, with some aplomb (gotta hand it to  Pops , he tends to hook up with smooth wimmins) replied: " Oh, hello, Chick ." [she didn't really say  Chick , but you get my meaning]. Which left us... where? My  Dad  and this female were together for 7 years, I met her a few times when they co-habitated in Phoenix. What I could remember off the top of my head was that she  liked neutral colors  and  ate only the wings  when my dad made fried chicken. Hardly a conversation starter. Still though, there I am, swaying above  this lady  to whom i can think of nothing to say, for the rest of the trip downtown, feeling weird -- why? Because, I felt like I had to say  something . Why?? I didn't feel compelled to yak with my  long-lost buddy  yesterday, why all of a sudden must I begin channelling  Miss Manners   today  in front of the woman who immediately bought me  expensive new shoes  after discovering what appeared to be {horrors}  athelete's foot  sprouting between my twelve year old toes during a visit to  Pops  one summer (I think it was actually sock fuzz --  Mom   was furious when she found out that  Miss Dix  had not only doused us all with  Tenactin , but then proceeded to wrap our old - perfectly serviceable - shoes in multiple layers of plastic shopping bags before carrying them out of the house to dispose of them in the  curbside  bin. God only knows what  Dixie  would have done if she saw what she took to be a  flea .) I couldn't  move  or start reading my magazine or something, because now we'd acknowledged each other and it would have been rude. One thing that was made incredibly clear though was that when someone knows  nothing  of the last ten years of your life, getting them  up-to-speed  as it were is an  incredibly daunting task . "Hmmm? No, I'm not working at the clothing store anymore, and I'm no longer dating Mike. I'm a lesbian now; unattached but co-parenting with a female Ex-partner of mine; living in Oakland; working as a Web Designer for a huge Insurance firm you've never heard of; also going to school to earn my EdD in Educational Policy.  Kid  is 5 and a half. She's great. Yeah, I still eat noodles all the time. Heh. [Dammit, I should have brought up  the chicken wings !]" "Nice to see you to. Yeah, keep in touch! [ Keep in touch??! ]" {Sigh} life is wierd.

       to Camp or not to Camp   This morning's dilema is as follows:  I've been invited to go on a camping trip that involves canoeing to get the the campsite location. This is an organized trip and there is only one adult spot left. I can bring  Boo  though. The trip is four days long and relatively inexpensive.    plus-side:    I love camping  I've been needing a break for awhile now. If i don't get into a different head-space soon I will go insane   Chunk of time with  Boo ! Yay!  I won't be able to do alone stuff with  Boo  very much after the new kid gets here so the timing on this is good    potential down-sides:    the canoeing part seems a bit sketchy. If it was just me I'd be fine but what if something (God, forbid) happens to the  Boo  and I need to get her the hell out of there? How quickly can we find help if we need it?   Boo  is a city kid. She's gone camping before but not for extended periods of time and usually there's a Winnebago involved. I could see this being fun for her for two days but  four ...?  I only know  one  of the people who will be going on the trip. What if the others are health-freaks or way into R&B or nudists or something?  I will be expected to  cook a meal  for these people. (Hope they like noodles and gravy...)  What if it rains?  Hmmmmm. Well, I'm going to be thinking about it all day so if anyone has any input feel free to comment.    In other news, I was cleaning last night and I found a photo album that my  Dad  gave me after my  Gramma  (his mom) died. I'd already glanced through it once but what I didn't realize was that each little slot actually has pictures on top of other pictures! There were like 50 pictures I hadn't seen! The best one is of my  Big Brother  around age four sitting in the dark. All you can see are these  red cowboy boots  and some  skinny legs . On the back my  G-ma  wrote "Van's favorite picture". I can't decide if I should send it to him now or wait until he's lecturing his daughters about some style matter then whip it out....

      missing the kid ( still  -- sigh). At least i see her tomorrow. Ole  Caseworker  is supposed to come by tomorrow eve as well and be very cheery about the fact that i've heard  nothing  about our potential new kid. Part of me feels really bad that I'm being such a complete baby about this and the other part of me really wants to throw things... ah well, I am nothing if not contrary. Big shout-out to the fabulous  Miss Tail . Thanks for the ride to work today. It was just the kickstart I needed to get me focused and happy on this lovely Wednesday morn. All of that happy focus has since  dribbled away in to nothing-ness  but it was nice while it lasted.

      o.k. let me make something clear here. I started this blog to get stuff out of my head and into an attractively arranged template so I could stare at it occassionally and giggle to myself instead of keeping it all locked inside and sucumbing to some mysterious heart disease. Given that this is stream of conciousness-stuff, and that I am writing about my life, it is inevitable that I may,  on occassion  say something that paints someone in a position they made feel uncomfortable/annoyed with. I am sorry for that. If anyone feels they have been unfairly portrayed feel free to utilize the comments section to refute and/or e-mail me and, if I think you have half a case, I will publicly retract and/or apologize for any untoward statements. If, however, the things I said are basically true but because I was in a wierd mood they came across in an unsavory way, tough titty! I am a woman of many moods and I refuse to kowtow to certain members of my reading audience who are semi-offended by my characterization of them and their filthy degenerate minds/lifestyle. I probably won't write anything truly mean about anybody up here but if you're in my life you can expect that I will herald your accomplishments to the high heavens but that I may also, on occassion, be annoyed with you. Especially, if you're being a  prick  about some offhand comment I made on a blog nobody reads! k. glad we got that straightened out. I feel much better now... How bout you?

      I like old guys. My two current favorites here at work are of the older persuation and I just think they're the cutest! especially when they're being all crotchety about something. Actually only one of them is feisty like that. The other might as well be  Mr. Rogers  with his all his good-natured helpfulness... every once in awhile though he'll drop some pseudo-sarcastic gem that makes me think he'd probably be a hell of a lot of fun outside the office. If I ever quit this place he will be the  first  person I proposition.

       I'm back!   Did we miss me? I was sick yesterday. I will not describe the type of sick due to the delicate sensibilities of some of my readers; suffice to say, much time was spent staring at the catbox (located in the  bathroom ) and wondering why the heck I don't clean that thing more often. No wonder I don't have any friends. (Actually, it just occured to me that the friends I do have are supposedly  "allergic"  to cats and that  that's  why they never come over... hmmmmm.... It's all beginning to make a freakish sort of sense.....). Anyway, I'm here and I'm realizing that I have nothing interesting to say so I'll stop for now. Hopefully, by lunchtime the mind will kick into gear and the witticisms will just spew forth....

      I have got to get better about avoiding conversations with  Boss #2  that begin  "So, how was...?"   Weekend, show, physical therapy  -- whatever it was, it  sucked  and it will be complained about until my eardrums burst or I begin hallucinating about the woods behind my house, one of the places were lived when I was growing up. Mmmm, green, growing things....   Tony  was just standing here, looking all cute and fresh, and telling me that his parents  watch golf  on TV. (Well, that wasn't the only reason he stopped by but the rest of the conversation was work related and therefore not interesting to me). Anyways, it got me thinking... Do people actually care that much about  golf ? I called the  Big Brother  to get some corroboration here, and apparently they  urlLink do .

       week-end part one   Now this is bliss  - went to  Summertime in the park  with  Mr. Lovah Lovah  et al. Fabulous time, fabulous weather, much fun was had by all (In a very low-key kind of way.) How beautiful is  Miss K .?? I'm tellin' ya,  M-Love  needs to stay on his damn toes with that one. I mean, it'd be slightly more fair if she was dumb or something but super cute  and  super  nice??! I ask you! The fabulous  Miss S . was looking super-fine as well. Very much with the dressed to represent (Vancouver in da house, yo!) and the hair going flip and the pretty green eyes. Man, if this is what the gals from up north are looking like these days I needs to move out! Especially now that it's legal to be gay up there.     urlLink "This is not a question of being nice. This is not a question of being a Liberal. This is a question of equality, of giving a people of a different orientation the same rights that I enjoy''     I'm going to use that in a dinner conversation at some point. "this is  not  a question of being nice...!" (Of course, I'll pretend i made it up, I mean, what's the point of being an American if you can't usurp a good quote from the 'Nucks?)    The  kid  and I had a fabulous time all week-end. The  CP  was being all accomodating 'n sheet so I got to have  Miss Boo  all day Sundee as well (that's right folks,  four days straight !) I cannot even begin to tell you how cool it is to look at your kid first thing Sat. morning and not immediately think about the 2 hour date you have with the bridge and the drop-off and the going home alone thing scheduled for later that day. I am happy.   Things I like about the new schedule:   Nice solid chunk of time to just freaking hang out with the kid  Saturdays and Sundays with  Boo  exploring the world  Knowing if  Boo  actually ate the lunch you made that morning   (This is  huge , BTW; that kid never eats but I had no idea the extent to which she doesn't eat. Friday she came home with one uneaten sandwhich, half a carton of milk, most of an apple and a full bag of carrots. which leads us to the fact that  Miss Boo  managed to subsist an entire day on a small bag of cheese nips and some pirate booty. Concerning but good to know.)    Getting to wind down together after we've been out and about all day. Sitting on the couch staring at the TV which none of us has the energy to get up and turn on -- priceless!   Things I do not like about the new schedule:   I do not get to see my kid for  three whole days !!!!!!     In other news  - some guy got shot right next to my house. Now, I know this sounds very weird but I don't feel all that weirded out by it. I mean, I live in  Oakland  - people get shot.   The fact that it was  right next door  makes me slightly concerned about retaliatory violence and all of that but really, in the grand scheme of things, this shooting was very directed. The shooters rolled up on this guy, some girl he was with started screaming, they shot him and left. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that they didn't shoot randomly into the crowd, they weren't just bored and out looking for someone to kill and there hasn't been anything like that in my neighborhood in the three years since I've lived there.   I dunno, I still feel relatively safe. I mean, of course i'm going to be a bit more on the look-out and of course I'm going to try to plan to keep my kid as away from what I perceive as unsafe situations as much as possible, but really, given what I can afford and what I need to do, my current set-up housewise is pretty much it (good-size, relatively secluded, safe, beautiful and, for the first time ever, relatively free of awful landlordness) I don't want to move... I bring all this up because my   urlLink front neighbor   was pretty freaked out and it got me to wondering if perhaps I was not quite freaked out enough. She actually saw/heard it happening so I'm sure it must have been a more visceral experience for her. I feel bad for her having to witness that. I feel bad for the person who died and for that person's family and kids and parents and friends. I feel bad but at the same time I don't personally feel any more threatened.  CP  was a champ about the whole thing though, cause I have to say part of what I was dreading most was having to justify living where I want to live to the kid's other mom.     So, yesterday the kid and I have the following out-of-the-blue conversation:   Boo:  Mom, what do you want most in the world -- besides me [interesting that she can read my mind enough to know my initial answer]  Me:  Um, a baby sister for you.  Boo:  K., I'll make you a deal. You want a little sister right? If I get you a baby sister, soonish, you have to get me a cell phone.  Me:  What's "soonish"? Like in the next month?  Boo:  Yeah. In the next month.  Me:  Deal.  Boo:  Deal. Shake.  I do not  even  know where this came from but I do know that if we get a placement in the next month, hand-to-god, my five-year-old's gonna be sportin' a pink Nokia!

      The next time some boy tells me I'm gay because I " haven't met the right man yet " I'm not going to bite his head off. Reasons for this newfound empathy are as follows: I do the same thing. Often times I find myself looking at the ladies and thinking " You, honey, are only making due because you have no idea what it's like to be with the Chick! " Case in point: There's this girl here at work who I soooo want to be my  Pretend Girlfriend . Usually, i'm good. Usually, I can go over to her cube and think helpful, business-ey thoughts while leaning over her desk and avoiding direct eye contact. But, sometimes, hand-to-god, I'm over there and she's all frustrated about something and she leans back in her ergonomic, roller chair and she smiles in some completely over-it kind of way and I just want to take her into the handicap stall, push her up against the wall and make her feel  good .  Again, I'm not saying I want to go meet her family or convince her to leave whatever excuse for a boyfriend she's got. I don't want to stay up all night giggling with her on the phone or massage her feet after a long hard day at the office; I just want to run my tongue over every visible part of her shivering body for a few minutes then I want to come back to my desk and get the hell to work; is that so wrong??

       Oh, the humanity!  The lovefest last night was not to be believed! The hugs, the laughter, the sheer unadulterated  bliss  of it all (a tear or two may even have been shed...!) I'm telling you, people, you do not know what joy is until you pick up your kid after not seeing her for  three whole days !! The world is once again a shiny happy place.  Boo  loves her room by the way. I know this because she said " Mommy, I love it !!" Seriously, who needs hard drugs when you've got a perfect kid around??    I was thinking today (on the train, as i left  Boo's  camp where I will go  tonight  to pick her up!) about boys. I was wondering what it is that makes them so vulnerable seeming (at least to me) all the time. Even the assholes seem as though they're covering up for some need to just get snuggly with somebody. I know, I'm sounding all girly but I'm not talking about that kind of snuggly. Believe you me, I am the  first  to try to wriggle away when a situation starts getting all " let's just hold each other... " but there is definitly something to be said for the fact that I know of at least three people who I could just go have a total breakdown in front of and (while they may take photos for later use) they're not going to think anything but how to make me feel better. A kiss, a hug, a hair ruffle, maybe a well-placed kick in the behind, and I'm ready to get back up on that damn horse. Do boys have support systems like that? I'm not one for generalizations (Ha!) but it seems to me that part of the problem is that everyone goes all squirmy wierd when a boy has trouble keeping it all together (at least in this culture, amoung the gents I see - o.k. now I've gone and ruined what could have been a kick-ass declarative statement by puting a bunch of contextualizers on it! Damn grad school, what have you done to me??!) I dunno though. Maybe it's just me puting my girly filter on a social situation I just don't understand. Hmmmm.    So, I'm on the train today and I notice that it's full of the best smelling people I think I've ever been around. Really good, homey smells, not all tarted up like the  38 Geary  or Uber Egg-span-seeve/BodyShop Like the  1 California , just nice, soapy clean. There's a boy here at work who smells like that. whenever he stops by to chat, all fresh and pressed I think "Wow, how is it possible that you're always so very clean?" (Sometimes I think it in a slightly mean way but that's only because I've just noticed some bizzare stain on what  looked  like an acceptably clean, work-appropriate shirt  after  i've already arrived at work and have been hobnobbing for the better part of an hour.  Boss #3  generally looks all pulled-together as well but in a different way. Like he thinks about it. well maybe not like he thinks about it  alot  or on a daily basis but like he knows what looks good on him and strives for that when out shopping.  Tony  (gonna call him Tony cause he's all "toney, toney" n' shit) just looks like everything he owns happens to be clean and free of holes. Interesting.

      BTW, lunch was fab! We discussed  Other Girl  at length. She sounds normal (which will  not  stop me from being violently jealous but at least  DB  may not get completely jerked around by this one.) He says she's got a potty mouth too, which is scary when you think about it. Two attractive young things (one skater, one emo) slouching around the town, swearing like sailors. Their children will be a  delight !     I was going to practice pool tonight but my teacher  Buddy P  hurt his back and can't come so I may just wuss out. Hurting one's back has got to be the suckiest type of physical ailment that can happen to one. Or if not  the  suckiest, at least a close second. I'm sorry you're hurt, Dude. Wish I could help. Since I cannot, I will instead, go home and watch bad TV while I eat noodles and think fat thoughts. Alone. On the couch. Missing my kid. Sigh. k. Just needed to take that moment. I'm fine now.

       How to survive at work - take 1  Ramble. I just got into a super-long rambley conversation with  Boss #3  and it was great! He's so cute. We went from  stylesheets  to  Grandmothers  to  Boo  to  Kick Ass Project Manager Lady (who I have a massive crush on -- actually, at this point, who  don't  I have a crush on??)  Boss #2  is sitting in her little area nattering away to someone else, which in the grand scheme of things is excellent because it means she's leaving me the hell alone....  it' wierd; it's not that she's all that different from  Boss #3 , it's just that for some reason when she's being wierd it bugs me but when  B-3  is being wierd, even if it's in the  exact  same way, I just blow it off.... Hmmmm... someday I will try to analyze why that is. Not today though. Today I will intensely dislike  B-2  and have that be o.k.

      Whoo Hoo!  Dirty Boy  is going to have lunch with me! He says he's not going to kiss me anymore because 1) He's getting all committed to some   other girl  who's  not  me and 2) He's still got his panties in a twist about the  urlLink cold sore reference  but whatever. He's easy on the eyes and I needs some distraction right this second.  Sux though, cause with the  new schedule  not to mention the other random creeping signs of total disinterest, I don't think  Beautiful Boy  is going to kiss me anymore either. (!!) Where am I going to get my kissing from?! Oh, well, I hear that there are moments in real life where kissing just doesn't happen. Perhaps we will explore  that  for awhile.  In other news,  LC  and crew are going to be hanging with us in the park on Father's day which will be nice.  Lanky Canadian Boy  is going to try to be all upstanding n' shit cause he wants  Boo  to respect him. Ha! He says he's not going to drink or swear that whole day. I personally think it's sweet  of him to think it but im also going to be ready for the hasty exit should his life suddenly necesitate a chronic binge. Hey, I've seen the photos/video, I know how he gets. ;-]

       Props   You know, i woke up this morning in a significantly better mood than i was in most of yesrterday and I just have to say I am most fortunate in having the world's best landscape peeps as neighbors. I stumbled out the door this morning and, my God, my front yard (which is tended to and arranged by the fabulous  Tall One , partner in crime to the also very cool   urlLink Small One  ) is beautiful! There are plants and flowers and beautiful rocks doing attractively arranged things all over the place. Me likes. I especially like that none of us thinks even for a moment that i'm going to be seriously responsible for any part of the design/upkeep. I mean, the  Tall One  occassionally throws me a bone -- she was very effusive when i managed to get a bunch of smooth stones poured into a mostly rectangular shape -- but we all know who's Queen of the yard at our joint digs. Yay, landscape artists! We *heart*.....

      Yay, the  Lanky Canadian  is back from his trip down south, and not a second too soon! He's all rested and tanned and happy-like... Yay, I say! We have  big  plans to go see the new Rugrats movie with  Miss Scout  (who, by the way, before she got annoyed with  me  and the  CP  and this whole  new schedule  thing requested that she be henceforth referred to as " Boo ". In this,  as with most things , her wish is my command). Above and beyond all of that, I now  REALLY  want to see  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean  but since  Miss Boo  is not quite old enough and I no longer have immediate access to a ten-year-old, I'm not sure how I'm going to swing it. I may just bite the bullit and go see it  by myself  in another town. I like having my  LC  back. It's nice having someone who thinks  Boo  is just as bees-kneesish as I do, to go on and on (and  on ) about when she's upset with me and I'm sad and missing her and not going to see her for  three more days !! o.k. I'll stop. Welcome back,  LC , don't ever leave again!

       So how was *your* weekend?   My goodness, my week-end was freaking  packed  with things and people to do and see! To begin, I spent the day at the Play-parenting workshop at  urlLink Mocha  which i had fairly high expectations of but which quickly (and i suppose predictably) dissolved into every other "meet n' greet" the world of the "aware gay" has ever produced.  What  is it with us gay people and our need to devulge our entire life stories when asked for a simple " Tell us your name and something about yourself "?? throw in " Where you are in the process " and/or " some of your experiences with your child " and it's all over but the singing as they say. Still though, it was not a total loss. The time we were all together (with the kids) was nice. Although, I have to say, for a place that's supposedly all about  children's art  the "mural painting" time was alot more " directed " than I had anticipated it would be. Here's me thinking that since this was a  kid  produced product then maybe the  kids  could choose what it should look like/how it should be colored but apparently what the  Directress  meant by "kid-produced" was that " I tell you what to paint and you [the child] paint it. That is unless you're to small to paint within the lines at which point I'll ask you to move 'outside the space' so another, more controlled child can realize my vision."  I did get a cool  urlLink book  though and the  Scout  seemed to have a good time so, it all turned out fine. (Ha! while i was looking for a link to the parenting book I came across this  urlLink one  which leads us to our next topic...     so, on my way out of the  Mocha  gig with my fifty-three children in tow, I hear my name being called and lo and behold there are  three cute young dykes  smiling largely at me and I have no idea who they are! Isn't that great! They don't call me  Chick Magnet  for nothing! anyway, I am pathetic and I suck and apparently i've met them all before and they're talking as if I remember and I'm hemming and hawing and have two squirmy babies who've just been buckled in so i throw around a few business cards and plead with them all to  please  "stay in touch," so we can "hang out" and it isn't until they've smiled and hugged off on thier merry way that I finally ( finally ) remember who the hell they are/were.  Ole Blue Eyes  was the current of the  Aussie  ,  CP 's Ex one removed from me, if that makes any sense. The  Aussie  has since returned to her native clime but I gather they (she and  Blue Eyes )still correspond.  Hip Young Thing  I met one afternoon at  CP's  whilst she was shooting one of her many films and the other,  Serious AIDS Ride Girl  I met in the company of one or the other of them a few months earlier. Why am I so lame? Second, why, whenever I meet gals of the lesbian persuation, these days, do I instantly think "I bet they'd really like  T " How tortured and guilty am I that I'm  still  trying to fix her up with someone who won't trash her heart?? Whatever.  No ladies for me, thank you very much. I am all about the babies....     Segue #2 - Speaking of which, I also found out at the get-together that the big matching meeting I was being depressed about because I hadn't heard from anybody at the agency isn't happening until this coming Wed. Fingers once again crossed, world, let's make this happen! In a fit of  something  I spent all day yesterday making  Scout's  room into a duo-kid space. I'm actually pretty excited with how it turned out although I spent  way  too much money at  urlLink IKEA  (that place is frightening, yet, still I continue to go...)  I'm soooo ready to just have that darn kid. sigh. I'm sure a huge part of it has to do with me being over work and having nothing else that really excites me about my current life (except for  Scout . She always excites me. I can't think about her right now though because we're starting  the new schedule  and I already miss her and I'm not  scheduled  to see her until Thursday evening! I think I'm going to try to worm my way into their evening tonight. P'raps dinner... hmmmmm......)  Anyway, that was the week-end. Let me know how yours went (use the "talk-to-me" link at right) and I'll post it here for the world's perusal.

       It's a friends blog!  I got a card in the mail yesterday from the fabulous  Miss Bee  ,mother no. 1 to the twins and the unbelievably fab  Lil' LB , (For those of you new to my world,  Miss Bee  ought not be confused with the other  Miss B , her partner in crime who is really more of a  "Ms." B  and who, while being equally fabulous, did  not  send me a card.) Can I just say,  I heart my friends! There's  Miss Bee , sitting in the coffee shop with her brood of fifteen all needing to be attended to and she thinks to not only write me a jaunty little note but also manages to get a stamp on it and throw it in the mail!! I stand in awe. A sweet note too. We wuv! Then, this week-end I get to watch the  best friend's  child who is also quite spectacular. We're going to this big foster parent training at  urlLink MOCHA  where for some reason the kids and the parents are split up into separate workshops (why do people  do  that??) so, while my babies are guaranteed a good time I'm actually losing out on the "hang-time" with them. whatever. The  best friend  and her  esteemed partner  aren't going anywhere anytime soon so i spose I'll be able to steal aforementioned child some other week-end..... How thrilled am i that all my buddies have cool kids right now? Very, that's how!   In other news.... went to go check out  Scout's  summer camp. More "Self-centeredness and You!" instruction from the  CP  but I practiced my Zen breathing and we all came through it with hardly a scratch. I did realize on the way home, though, that part of my issue with  CP  is that I think she should be on her knees every waking minute of the day thanking the God almighty that she was blessed with such a super-riffic kid and she thinks more in terms of "Oh, I didn't realize until right this second here at the orientation meeting that I would have to drive an extra ten minutes every day to get my child to her really kick-ass camp.  Hmmmm. Why did 'we' [meaning me] rule out the camp across the street from my house again? [Expensive, too old for our kid, and with four weeks of swimming -- Scout can barely be persuaded to run through the sprinklers]" I did not scream. I sat. I mused. I found my happy place. I channeled Budda. Anyway, enough of that. Back to my friends. I'm lonely today because the  Lanky Canadian  is off on some obscure jaunt down the coast -- again, I'm not sure why these people think they can just desert me on a whim but rest assured, jobs will be lost...! ( Best friend  keeps pulling the same thing where she's off to the spa for the week-end with  Chick number 2 , Lalalala... "Relaxation", she calls it! I call it "out of range should i need her sorry ass!!!" and don't give me this "works incredibly hard on socially concious issues, trying to move into a bigger place, raise a child and negotiate two relationships" crap! Tell it to the Marines!)  So, there you have it.  Lanky Canadian  out in sun with pretty girlfriend. Me stuck in office with  Boss number 3  (who's not so bad, actually), hoping  Boss number 2  stays home sick again today.

       Whew!  Well, the graduation was fun. I *heart*  Joanne !! (one of  Scout's  classmate's mums) She's all Long Island and stuff. With the big emotions and the "Don worry about dit!" I love her! Sigh, so, I'm back and I'm tired. In one of those wierd moods that only  CP  can spark. I've been mad at her on and off for the last five years and it's not getting better. Usually (always) it's the "totally self-centered" thing -- the complete refusal to just  do  something for someone else if she can't see how it benefits her. so today we're being all uber co-parenty and she announces that she's not going to do something (i forget what) and that she's self-centered but "o.k. with it." I just don' know. It seems to me that I'm going to have to learn to deal with it since I'm stuck with her for the next 15 years (although, thank  GOD  for  Sarah  doing girlfriend duty. I don't what I'd do if I had to be invested in the rest of the woman's life) ... thing is She's not always awful. And she's a damn good co-parent. It just the selfish thing that kills me. Sigh. Oh well. the cermony was sweet, my kid is a princess and it's all over for the next little bit so.... If anybody knows how to make this stuff not matter so much, let me know...

       Pulling teeth  Why is talking to  Boss Number 1  so much like pulling teeth??  Sheesh, he sits in his office all day long dreaming up new and ingenius ways to  irritate  us then he goes all wounded puppy when someone has the  audacity  to quit for a better postition where they  might , heaven forbid, actually get a raise (not to mention some respect)...! whatever.... I need to not let him get to me. It's just that every single time I talk to him it feels like a goddamn audit "so, how's school? It's finished right? and the kid, you expect her when? So, you're probably going to be able to do full-time this summer...?" I mean, if I thought for a second that he actually cared it'd be different but all he's thinking about is his stupid quarterly earnings.... o.k. breathe.... I will not let the bastard get me down. I will remember that he is a small, miserable little man with a failing business and a wife who is  way  too much woman for him... There. I feel much better now. I'm off in 47 minutes to attend the kid's grad ceremony! I intend to videotape, photograph and/or transcribe every single second of it onto a shimmering fabric woven from Jason's golden fleece... or maybe not. depends on how i'm feeling.

       "Hurry up and wait" still...   Just got off phone with the  Caseworker . He is a study in being encouraging while at the same time completely non-commital.   Highlights from this particular conversation:  "Good news! We're having a training that you should probably come to since we'll probably be seeing something come up for you fairly soon."  "I should probably schedule another visit to the house just in case we get a bite this time. Hmmmmm. How about early next month?"  "You're at the top of the list at this agency but then again, since you're looking for a younger child you'll probably be up against several other families on thier side."  AAAARRRRGGGGGGG! There are 70,000 waiting children in the California Foster Care System. I just want  one . Sigh. Oh well, good things come to those who've abandoned all hope. We shall persevere.  In other news, i just found out my  Big Brother  is planning to participate in a triathalon in Hawaii. My first question is, of course, why even go to Hawaii if you're just going to torture yourself once you get there.  urlLink Jason  is also trying to get to Hawaii. Go visit his  urlLink donations page  and give him lots of money. (Technically it's going to the AIDS Project LA , so even if you don't feel like doing something just because I say so and/or you don't know him from Mathilda's second cousin,  donate  anyway, it's a good  urlLink cause !)

       One day old and already in trouble  Let me begin with a retraction. in yesterday's post I made up names for some boys I know. While I stand by my naming convention  I admit that someone unfamiliar with the gentlemen in question may be led to certain assumptions that may not be true. That said, let me here state for the record that while I chose the alias " Beautiful Boy " specifically because the lad I'm referring to has long golden hair, super-pretty eyes and a slammin' physique, I did  NOT  in  any  way mean to imply that the person of " Dirty Boy " is at all below standard accepted levels of cleanliness and/or hygiene. In fact, I would have to say that my buddy  DB 's sleek little skater body is almost too clean -- the word "squeaky" leaps to mind. The reason I chose that particular nom de plume for my darling angel is because, quite simply, I don't think I've ever met an individual with his mind so firmly lodged in the gutter. That's all. Deny it if you will,  DB  but despite your butter-wouldn't-melt exterior, you are a filthy, degenerate and everybody knows it. Let me also state, for the record, that I in no way meant to imply that my  Dirty Boy  has any known comunicable diseases. All I'm sayin' is every time we make out I break out. Conclude what you will.   Whew! Man, this whole anonymous thing is harder than I thought. I'm going to have to come up with a better naming convention. Speaking of which, my bub who shall henceforth be referred to as " Scout ", is graduating Kindergarten tomorrow and I am so excited I can't even stand myself!  Missy Scout , You are super huge and super-splendid and I can't even begin to think what I could have done in this life or the last to deserve such a great little girl but there you go. In other child news, there's a huge matching meeting at the agency today so i may just get a "possible placement" this time around. Not holding my breath or anything because then I would pass out and potentially miss a whole bunch of work-related tet-a-tetes but... gosh, it would be nice to know who our second bub is going to be.... anyways. More later, after I've swallowed a vat of coffee.

       Inappropriate conversations - take 1   So, anyway, I started this thing primarily because I am feeling this need to engage in wildly inappropriate conversation with my peeps at work. like to the point where I'm forcing them to listen to my ramblings well after the point where they've indicated in  no  uncertain terms that they are  Not  interested/passed out. Today I'm wanting to discuss my lip. My lip freakin hurts. It hurts because I let it be chewed on by two (yes,  two ) boys this week-end. Not sure what I was thinking with either of them but whatever. I'm pretty sure it was the second of the two who shall heretofore be known simply as  Dirty Boy  and not the first,  Beautiful Boy  (since it seems as though we now have a theme on our hands). The fact that there was lip chewing at all is remarkable given that I'm pretending to be a lesbian but, since THE  BREAK-UP , ladies have got me wicked spooked and a girl's got needs dammit! I think  Dirty Boy  is responsible for the soreness because a) he is a freaking animal when it comes to kissing (I'm scared to try anything else -- I don't want to get hurt) and b) every single time we make out I get a  massive  cold sore eruption. (I know, sexy, but true).  Beautiful Boy  did his fair share of chewing as well and I  was  a tiny bit tipsy so I may have been getting a bit more banged up than i thought but still...  My lip HURTS!

      well, here we go! As I'm sure every single blogger in the whole wide world has declared upon setting out to chart the ins and outs of thier mostly pathetic lives, I'm new to this, folks, so bear with me. First let say that I'm just not seeing any kind of chat/post comment feature so, for now, if you have anything you need me to hear  urlLink drop me a line .

      So, at the urging of  Miss Bee  I joined  urlLink Friendster  a little while ago and soon thereafter  Mistah Lovah Lovah  inquired as to whether or not i would be  his  friend to which I replied in the affirmative and  now  (after having not having checked in a while) it would seem that not only is  urlLink Alice  suddenly a part of  my personal network , I also apparently have  21484  other close personal  buddies ... Is anyone else intimidated by what this system seems to be supposing...?

       Riddle me this...   I just got a  spam message  with a subject line stating: "Her feminine size" (??!) My mail host wouldn't let me open it (well, it  strongly cautioned  me against entertaining such a  foolhardy idea  and since I don't feel like  wiping out my harddrive  and all the attendant project files on it, I will obey) but seriously...!  What on earth  could that be about??? Anyone??  Also, what is it about " dating " that makes you want to  run back  to the relative safety of your  ex's bed ?? I've been having some  majorly inappropriate thoughts  about a coupla of them lately (thoughts which  quite conveniently  bypass the " issues " and skip straight to the  sexy  bits) ..... Ah, well,  Life  has seen fit to give me a  nice measure of time  to spend with some  very  talented  SOs  (which is more than those poor starving kids in  Quebec  will ever have!) so I s'pose I should not get all cranky about the fact that  certain people  won't just drop everything they're doing in order sleep with me whenever I ask them to. ( Selfish  bastards...)

       One down, one to go!  Well, that was fun. O.K. so maybe not fun, ha ha... Can I  just  say, if you're going to go out on a  date  with someone and you want to ask them about stuff that  when they answer  is going to provoke  on-going fits of nervous laughter , can I  just  suggest that you ask them over  e-mail  or during the  pre-date phone call .... Can I  please  just put that out there??! K. So,  date  was o.k.  Young Lad  was nice enough but a bit different than he initially "presented", shall we say... (Oh, my  goodness ! It would appear that the cute butch girl I smiled at on the street this morning is  HERE  for some sort of meeting...! well, hell-lo... Sorry, {focusing}where was I...?!) Anyway, ended on a  handshake  and a "Nice meeting you" then I was  off  to my snuggley, fluffy bed, to pay some much needed attention to my cats and to place an introductory call to Date #2,  B-R Guy , who BTW was awfully nice. He seems articulate and funny and I  think  he may be willing to indulge my  power tool fetish  so you know it's all good!! Anyways, I'm seeing him on  Sundee  after the peeps leave so we shall see what we shall see....

       Yes, but is it cheating...?  Just e-mailed  Young Lad  to re-arrange times with him (onna counta I  was  looking forward to  going out  and  meeting up  and  stumbling around  drunk a little bit and  now  I kinda just want to  get out  of our  date  so i can go home and get on the phone with someone else...!) And, thing is, I actually feel a little bit bad about it. I feel bad because  Young Lad  is a nice person -- I think (!!) -- but he's just not giving as good  conversation  as some of my other potentials...! On the other hand, the  whole situation  strikes me as kind of  hilarious . Let's all  bear in mind  that I have actually met  none  of these  people  and that I've only seen somewhat blurry photos of them (none of which were  particularly  scary) and I'm  already  getting all  attached  to some and  sorry-feeling  for the others. Gawd, I am  such  a freakin'   girl   about this stuff! Oh, well. Whatever. My capacity to be weird amazes even me...

       Now, they come crawling back...!  For those of you who are  keeping score ,  three  more of our original  11  potential datees have "checked back" as of this morning, and I have to say, I'm no longer  impressed . I dunno what it is but they're just not as  compelling  as they were last week. I have  two dates  set up, one  on-going conversation  and a "get wit chu when I get back from  Dallas "  (which could mean  anything  really) and I think I'm good with that.  Not  that I think these  two dates  of mine are going to "turn into anything" but the simple act of lining them up has made me think  long and hard  {snicker} about what  exactly  it is I'm looking for. I mean let's review the  facts , here. I have  work  8 hours a day, five days a week. I have my  kid  3-4 days a week, I'm trying to get  another kid  who I will have seven days a week and  grad school  starts Aug. 25th which means that I'll be spending  at least  two evenings a week in  class  and  hopefully some time  studying  and  writing papers  and  stuff . Which leaves me with what...? approximately  8 hours a week  to grocery  shop ,  wash  clothes,  clean  the house,  de-flea  the cats,  kill  the ants,  wash  the dishes,  return  the library books,  watch  my favorite TV  urlLink show   check in  with my peeps,  take  a shower and hopefully,  sleep . K. So, essentially what I'm looking at is a  chronic lack of time  in which to engage in the requisite  face time  to conduct an  actual  relationship with an adult person while, at the same time I continue to want to have SEX! And not just any ole sex. I want to have that happy, cool, relaxed kind where should you start laughing for no particular reason right in the middle of it you don't have to spend the next three hours doing "damage control". [see above: I have  no time  for damage control!]  Also, I don't want to have anybody  freak right out  if I have to cancel on them because I have my kid an  extra  day or I have to  finish a paper . Basically, I want the kind of relationship I have with my  friends  + sex. (Although, I  gotta  say, the kind of relationship I have with  some  of my  friends  is pretty damn close to that -- heh heh heh... sorry...moving on...) So, this is what I want, I guess. I want to establish  on-going friendships  wherein it is a given that  if  the urge strikes us and  if  we have the time, boots will knock. What do we think? Is it completely naive to envision such a thing happening??  Anyway,  Date #1  with  Young Lad  is tonight. He seems perfectly charming. He also seems like he's about  twenty  so hopes for this going much further are slight but it should be fun just the same.

      ah ha! Upon further investigation it would seem that  Scary Girl  explicitly stated in her last e-mail to me that she would " ttyl !!" (I'm assuming that means "Talk to you later" -- ah, these crazy kids with their abbreviations...!) so I'm off the hook, right? Or is that simply a way to wrap up a conversation and I am  still  required to "check in"?? Anyone? Help...?

        urlLink Segregation ...   Good or Bad? Discuss...  Didn't we  just  spend a whole bunch of time trying to become  more  visibly in "the mainstream" so we could become more familiar (meaning  less scary) and ergo less likely to get pounded all the time...? I dunno, In my humble opinion the  only  rational/legal way  urlLink this school  can continue to exist is if it is open to anyone who wishes to attend it. I mean, I can see establishing it as a safe space for gay, lesbian, transgender, and questioning youth but seriously, I don't think a publicly funded school is allowed to  not let  certain students in (and what are they going to have to do anyway -- pass a little  quiz ? Produce someone of the  same gender/orientation  and make out with them for a specific amount of time?? Mind -- boggles...) C'mon. Separating " the gays " may make for a more comfortable high school learning environment ( maybe ) but it's not going to address the larger social issues of  inclusion  and  acceptance  and I think it might just end up making things worse further down the line...

       Howdy!  I just sailed in here three minutes ago. BART sucks! Anyways... have not yet had coffee so I'll keep this short. My  Dads  and my  niece  are coming to town for a coupla days in just a bit and I'm sooooo excited! I did the  full-on  bathroom clean-up (which involved  bleach  no less!) last night and tonight I'm going to throw down with some vacuum attachments and a little  spic n span ! That's right people, watch my dust!...er...ah... I mean  lack  of dust... oh whatever...   In other news, my truck got broken into. At least the camper shell part of it.   What they took: a pack of  toilet paper , a bag of  potatoes  and some clothes washing  detergent . (No, I do  not  live in my truck! I went shopping for  supplies  and was too  lazy  to take everything inside...)  What they  did not  take: my  tent , my  tools , my  radio , the  money  in my glove box, my kid's  library books , my kid's  float-ey toys , yet  another  container of clothes washing  detergent  (I guess the thieves had a brand preference) and my  electric pump .  They  did not  break my window, they did not leave the campershell door open and they did not otherwise trash or destroy anything else. All in all, I'm pretty o.k. with the whole situation. If nothing else, it's a nice little kick in the pants to get me to clean out my damn truck!  Oh! and I just remembered they took some  magazines  a friend had given me (Martha Stewarts'  Living ,  Real Simple  and  Lucky . Now, since even  I  am not witty enough to comment on the buckets of irony inherent in their selections, i'll not even try.) Bye now. I'm off to find a cup and some joe.

      Quick  ad  update: out of  11 initial flurries  of stat exchanges and a  week-end  to digest ...  THREE  persons have stepped up to continue with the correspondence! Whoo hoo! One is, funnily enough,  Mr. Initially-Insipid  (or " I-I "), two is  Young Lad  from the East Bay who is keeping me in  freaking stitches  with his postings and three is a disillusioned  engineer/bike racer guy  who just told me he's "cool with my age" because he's into " older  women" ( prick !!) Anyways, of the ladies,  Scary Girl  was the only one I wrote back to and she has not replied as of yet today -- but that may be  my fault  because I  may  have been the one who was supposed to "follow up".... not sure. Should check.   So there we have it. I have scheduled  two  dates: one with  B-R guy  and one with  Young Lad .    I-I  and I have decided to wait until he returns from some alleged "business trip" before attempting further plans (which may just be a nice way of  blowing me off  but we shall see...)  For now, I must say, while I am a bit  disheartened  that some of my  original  picks (who were campaigning with some enthusiasm  last  week) have failed to check back, I'm not at all displeased with the conversations I'm having with the few who remain  in play  as it were. Good show,  Gentlemen . Let the games begin!

       the response   So, the  ad  was placed on  Friday  and i  must  say the response was better than I anticipated. Out of about  67 replies  there were  10  which were  not  insipid and  1  which  was  insipid but it was soooo insipid that I  had  to reply and the ensuing dialog has actually been quite hilarious. The  ad  ran in both the  Girl seeks Boy  and the  Girl seeks Girl  category (not to worry. I was a  good  bi-girl and warned everyone that that would be happening...) The  breakdown  in response, by  gender , was  64 boys  and  3 girls . One of the girls was looking for someone " feminine  and  discrete " both of which I am  in spades  but I just didn't think it would work; another wondered if I would like to meet her husband accompanied by a pic of her (i'm assuming, husband's) member ( sexy !)plus they live in  San Jose , and the last was from a  charming lady  who seemed intelligent and normal and who I must therefore  be afraid  of. Not that I'm  not  going to write back but I don't know if I have it in me to associate with a gal I can't  keep at arm's length . P'raps I should give ole  San Jose  and her body part a chance...

       Disturbing interludes…   In an otherwise perfect weekend. Weekend =  great ! Had  the kid  all day both days so you know it was all good.  Sat.  was spent running around to various  birthday  type events including stopping by the new  Hayward  residence of  my girls  and finding out that both of them are doing fine. Their moms moved them into a  new house  with  four  bedrooms so they all have their own space (at least for now.) Her  new man  seems fairly nice and the girls looked good. Stayed just long enough to  pass out the prezzies  and the  contact info  should they need to find me and we were off to the  next get-together  in  SF . Second  birthday party  was very awfully fun as well with lots of cool parental interaction (there’s a neat little  super-shy  kid whose parents are trying to get him into  Boo’s  school. They’re from  New York  and they are FAB-ulous! I  really  hope we see more of them.) Then,  back to the homestead  for a bit before dropping the  child  off with the  Misses B/ees  et al for a sleep-over then it was off to the  Big City  to indulge in a little  adult  entertainment by way of a very swank dinner  party  thingie hosted by a  wonderful lad  who was celebrating the end of his first year with his lovely  soon-to-be-an-aspiring-writer-boy-toy . Party was very nice. Super low key,  fascinating  people, aforementioned  STBAWBT  was A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E and  quite  a catch and I think extra congratulations are warranted!  Congrats !! Got to confab with all manner of  choice  people and got to watch the  fireworks  go off over  PacBell park  (because, when all is said and done, what’s the  point  of having a swanky celebratory party if you can’t adjourn to the balcony for a  festive lightshow …??) Last but certainly not least, I was able to  round out  my eve engaged in a much needed  tete a tete  with the ever elusive  Pretty Boy  who since he got  urlLink THE JOB  has become harder to pin down than  a greased flea   but he was  home  and  up  and  willing to entertain  me for a bit – bring me up to speed re: the job, the car, the gym etc. – before sending me on my way back to the  snuggly cotton freshness  of my green-ey gold bed…. We {heart}  Pretty Boy ! He’s a  keeper  that one….  Then, this morn,  up  and  shower  and  off  to get a  bagel bribe  to take to the  B  house in exchange for my  Boo . Switch happened, short visit occurred then  off , once again to yet  another  birthday party for one of young  Boo’s  very best-est friends at her house in  Frisco .   And here’s where the  weirdness  begins…     So, there are  all these kids  running around right, and there’s this one,  Lane  (that’s his  real  name by the way. Mark my words this kid will end up in the news -- and not in a good way)  who is  obsessed  with  Boo’s Best Friend  like to the point where he keeps following her around and demanding to know where she is any time she manages to elude him. Both kids are about six years old but  Lane  is bigger and stronger and at one point he was pulling  BBF  around by the arm to wherever he wanted her to be. Now this is  key . I’m  all for  the fun and games and I  grant you  that I don’t know this kid and his relationship to  BBF  but there was a point in there where he had  dragged  her to the couch and was kind of  sitting  on her and she was saying “I want to get up” and he  wasn’t letting her  and  no one  (by which I mean the  adults  present) seemed disturbed in the least. Everyone was  smiling  and discussing which schools were “ good ”. So, I went over and made him get off her and she  RUNS  away from him and climbs onto the couch next to her mom who is pregnant and resting and smiling and tries to kind of  crawl back behind her .  Lane  comes over,  grabs her leg , pulls her off the couch  onto the floor  and kind of crouches on her. She assumes a sort of  balled up fetal position  and once again all the adults in the room, mom included, sit there watching this little spectacle with these “kids will be kids" kinds of smiles plastered on their faces. Meanwhile  BBF  is not moving.  Lane   is continuing to terrorize her. I look at  Boo  who looks and me and we both shrug and look at  BBF 's mom who FINALLY sort of notices that her kid is kind of comatose and says “Are you O.K.?” I stand and stretch (in what I hope is a menacing way) toward  Lane  who finally moves away from  BBF . She continues to stay huddled up though until her mom leans forward to touch her, then she springs up and   runs behind the couch .  Lane  starts to go after her but he is stopped by her mom who says, “Not right now Lane, I think she needs a little  alone  time.” (!!!!) So. O.k. am I right in thinking “What the Hell??!” Is that not completely fucked up? Anyone?? Now, I know all the “not really my business”, “may not know the entire situation”, “shouldn’t assume that this is typical” blah, blah, blah bullshit but, seriously, is it just me?? I am  completely  disturbed by the fact that a roomful of adults would  sit there  while a five year old is tortured and I am amazed that this  little psychopath  is even allowed  near   BBF  (apparently they are old friends. His nickname for her is “ NumNum ”) on a regular basis. What could I  possibly  be missing? Anyways,  BBF  managed to stay kind of away from him for the rest of the party – upon picking up her son and watching him grab  BBF  from behind and announce he was “bringing her” with him,  Lane’s mom  beamed and was heard to remark “Lane just  loves  BBF!” and I am in shock. I’m all over cutting  BBF’s parents  some slack because they seem like nice enough people and I know it can be hard to deal with  tons of kids  and  birthdays  and  pregnancy  and all of that but still, that kind of dynamic isn’t built instantly, right? It looked like it had been going on for awhile… {sigh}. Anyway. Not saying I’m the world’s  best parent  or anything but I do think sometimes that there’s some  fucked up  stuff being accepted as “normal behavior”. Then again, what can a person realistically do…?   You know what though, if anyone  ever  sees me being abusive or putting my kid in an abusive situation (even if  I  think I’m being normal and rational)  please  tell me your concerns. I’m not saying I’ll change anything right away but I’ll listen and I might snap out of  whatever weirdness  I’m indulging in.... Maybe. Maybe not. Probably if I’m not seeing that my kid is being potentially damaged, I’m not going to be in the mood to listen to criticism. Even so, tell me anyway.

       Call for submissions  By the way, i  love  hearing from my  peeps  in response to the stuff I write what'd I'd  really  like though is for people to use the  "comment" feature  at the end of each post. It says "{sigh}" when it's empty and it makes me sad to look at. Obviously, if what you want to say is very  personal  then feel free to contact me the  other way  but if it's just a general "Um,  THAT  was kind of stupid..." or something equally helpful, i'd love having the ensuing  flamewar  be a bit more public....

       Receptionist wanted...  Yo, if anyone out there knows of anyone who is looking to hire an  entry-level receptionist , office assistant type let me know. There's a  super-nice  lady here at work who is looking to change careers (currently a security guard); super personable, but not a lot of office experience. (and  cute ! Can I just say...!!  Not  that that's any reason to hire her  nor  is it my  primary  reason for wishing to assist but jeesus, gawd, I gots to say, she's pretty easy on the eyes...{mind drift} Oops... sorry, where were we...)     The  kid  has a luhau (sp?) at school today so she is all dressed up Hawaiian style and I  just  have to say, she is adorable!  Mistah L-L  is picking her up from school and he has a digital cameral so those of you who want access to some primo "Boo-being-cute-in-a-sarongey-sort-of-way" pics let me know and I'll see about floating some your way...     So, I'm feeling the lack of  snuggling  in my life and am thinking about  posting an ad  on Craigslist. I imagine it would run thusly:   "Here's what I want. I want someone who is mostly nice, fairly funny and kinda cute to read this ad. I want that person to respond with  a witty e-mail that will make me smile. I want us to meet for coffee/tea/bagels/whatever and freaking slay each other with our charming ways/ hilarious wittisisms. (I want someone who knew I spelled "witticism" wrong but was willing to cut me a little slack.) Once we've established that we're both brillant, sexy and 'doable' I want us to figure out a time when we can get busy. I want us to continue to write to each other; to occassionally call each other late at night and, whenever there's a break in our otherwise stupidly hectic schedules, I want us to f*** . If this works for you let me know; if not, why not? I'm curious..."    What do we think?     BTW, the butt is doing fine. It was many time less painful this morning than it was yesterday although it still hurts to sit...

       Nice!  Less than 5% of the Californian voting population may get to  urlLink choose  the next governor! Sweet! K. folks, let's do this...! All I need is 3,500 bucks and a few thousand siggies, whaddaya say? "  Chick  in 2003 "??    You know what's nice? An  impromptu  evening visit from the ever-fascinating  Miss Tail , that's what! What's nicer? Her bringing  ice cream  and wearing an awfully cool pink, stretchy top thing! We wuv!!Gonna miss that girl when she's gone {sniff} but at least she sounds like she's moving in a fairly happy direction and what the heck, I  may  find a way to make it  all the way  into  the City  now and again for a visit to her new pad. {smiling bravely. moving on...}    So, my  back/butt  still hurts. If anyone knows anyone who gives a decent  massage  send em my way will ya. (Actually, if anyone knows anyone who gives an  indecent  massage...! heh heh heh -- Ouch!)     I am curently reading " urlLink Eyes on the Prize " the "companion book to the award winning documentary showcasing the civil rights movement from 1954-1965" and getting all outraged 'n sheet. Thing is, I am  a product  of this whole move to integrate thing.  Moms  and  Pops  were there,  on  the buses,  in  the marches.  Big brother  was featured in one of those " babies in jail while their parents await sentencing " photos, I've  heard  the stories but, thing is, i don't think I ever really  understood  them until I started doing some  re -reading (or in this case,  first  time reading) of some of the seminal texts that came out during and about that period of time in our fabulous nation's history. I mean, sure, I colored the cut-out of  MLK Jr.  in kindergarten. I sat through the requisite snippets from the civil rights movies in Civics class. I read " urlLink Soul on Ice ", I was president of the Black Student Union fer chrissakes -- why then am I surprised and outraged at by the  murder  and subsequent  double  "hung juries" of   urlLink Medgar Evers  ? Why do I know more about  Fannie  Mae   (the folks who service my loan) than I do about   urlLink Fannie Lou Hamer   and the drive for  voter registration  in Mississippi? What about   urlLink Joseph Rauh  , fer chrissakes, and the truckload of chutzpah it took for him to champion the  urlLink MFDP  cause as well as to spend the rest of his  81  years fighting discrimination and attempting to ensure that the law be used as "a vehicle for righting social wrongs and not perpetuating them."??    I am  amazed  that I, a fairly progressive, mixed-race, soon to hold a doctorate in  Educational Policy , flaming liberal know  next-to-nothing  about these people and the events they helped create and support. I suck. I'd love to  blame the system  though, so if anyone else feels woefully inadequate re: the discussion of these and other pertinent historical movements let me know. If there are enough of us  dumb-asses  out there I think we've got a really good case for  shifting the blame  onto the schools!

      Went to see   urlLink Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle   BTW. It rocked!! I was slightly trepidatious because an aquaintance had labeled it " urlLink bad . and not the good type of bad..." but after having seen it I can only say what the hell did he expect?? I found the movie to be exactly what it was sold as and  delightful  to boot. I could have lived without  Bernie Mac  and his bizarre performance as a man who apparently was instructed only to "make something up" instead of being given actual lines to deliver but other than that... Kudos McG and crew! Nice job. I laughed out loud several times and when the music started for the Strip club scene (featuring the   urlLink PussyCat Dolls   in addition to our handy trio) I believe I may have actually said aloud "Sweet, God, no! Are they...??" before being silenced by the sheer mass of sexiness that proceeded to pour forth from that screen. My gawd. Wow. that's really all I can say. Wow.

       Is it just me...?   Or is it wierd for an  urlLink eight year old  to be out pimping for her moms and grandmoms?   "and remember all you men out there my mother 29 and grandmother 57 are both single their address is the same as ours..."    Also, I really don't buy that a kid wrote this:   my grandmother carolyn is into genealogy and if you visit her links below you will meet some of my kinfolks hayes in missouri and davis in oklahoma also my mother roxie is very pretty and she is also single so you must check her out..   I mean, c'mon, what eight year old knows how to spell geneology and uses the phrase "you must check her out"??  Anyway, I've had some coffee and I'm sitting very still so my mood is slightly better.

       Today I am  not  sexy  Today I am in pain. I'm tired and whiney and crippled. Yesterday I was the same but I had the good sense to stay home and sleep all day. Today I am sitting upright and typing and feeling sorry for myself. I know that I am not sexy today because I met some lady in the elevator who was. She was smiley and vivacious and wearing neat stretchy leopard print pants. She had platinum blonde hair, chocolate skin and two gold teeth. She was wearing 6 inch heels and when she said "Anything sweet in there?" (referring to the plastic bag I was carrying) she coupled it with a super-toothy smile and a Costa Rican accent.  She  is sexy. I am not her ergo I am  not . Today, I'm not even close.

       Mistah Lovah Lovah  just filled me in on  his  week-end complete with  video  footage. On the one hand I am horrified. On the other I am somewhat grateful that this particular technology didn't exist when  we  were young and stupid. The  photographic evidence  is bad enough...

       Deeee-scusting!  You wanna know what'll turn you off  chocolate syrup  forever? Being on the coffee clean-up crew for the week and having it be your first day cleaning and thinking it is about time to change the  syrup  bottle (since it currently takes  thirty-two  short pumps to get even a  drop  of chocolate and that's just not going to cut it, this is the government people!!) and pulling out the  pump-thingie  and, in a burst of enthusiam for the  sheer mass  of chocolate that is running down it, swiping a finger along it's  glistening brown shaft  (stay with me folks, we'll talk about *that* later) and  right  before popping said finger into mouth, glancing down and seeing that the  entire shaft  of the chocolate pump is covered with  mold  (!!!!!!!!) ! That's right folks,  whitey-green dots  of chocolate syrup mold. Not that i'm  implying  anything and not that anything like this has  ever  happened to me but I gotta tell ya, were it to happen, I think I'd be pretty grossed out....    Week-end was weird.  The Good  stuff first:  Ms. B  has emerged from her surgery altogether fine, practically spry in fact (not too mention extremely sexy-looking in a pajama-pants wearing way...  woof !) and is now able to brag about the  forty-two inch  scar across her sternum which circles around to her lower back region.  Congrats  on the  quadruple bi-pass ! I still say you should tell everyone a shark bit you. Anyways. Had a special long visit with aforementioned  Ms. B  which was simply  delightful . Also got the quick "how-ya" with the  Missus Bee  and (since they arrived in my car) got the super-mondo  best friend  and best friend's babe check-in as well. Speaking of whom, the lovely  Lu  was persuaded to make a  repeat appearance  in my world on  Sundee  for a few hours and she just never fails to impress me with her  all-round  greatness!   The Bad  stuff wasn't "bad" in the typical sense of the word...[ Disclaimer:  the following contains thoughts  and impressions as they filter through my head and are concerning my  kid . They have not borne any scrutiny from the standard cast of characters whom I employ to help me "keep it real" and so may be a bit unformed.  Also , let me her state for the record that i absolutely understand that  on every level  I have  the best kid  ever and that I am truly, hugely blessed and that there are people right now in  China  who are forced to go to sleep at night without knowing the pleasure of a "Don't let the bedcats bite!" Sung out in an absolutely sincere tiny, sleepy voice. I  know  this... That said...]   My  kid  was weird this week-end. Actually, we were both weird. She was weird in a very insecure, needing to be re-assured of things I  know  she knows, jealous of pretty much  everyone/thing  else in her universe kind of way and I (since I'm uniquely  unqualified  to deal with issues considered to be sterotypically "female" -- like the whole seeming lack of self-esteem; how can I be  beautiful like a princess  so the world loves me -- kind of issues) reacted poorly. Now, before I go into further detail I would also like to put forth the statements I do  not  want to hear in response to my semi-rant:   "That's it?! That's nothing!  My  kid [insert something horrific here]....." (I  know  that in the  grand scheme  of things I am blessed. I  know  that these issues  per se  are  not  that serious. i also know though, that if your kid is acting  one way  through much of her short life and she suddenly begins acting  another way  -- I don't care if it's as simple as she always  paints  with  blue  and now she's  coloring  in  red  -- in my opinion it bears paying attention to. If you simply  cannot  stand listening to my  drivel  then skip to part three. That part's about sex.)   "Don't worry about it. It's normal." (Again, let me state for the record that I'm  not  saying my kid is out on the streets every night looking for better ways to shoot up. I understand that she is a growing little girl and will go through phase of development that are  perfectly normal  for her age and learning. Again, though, I have to say there were  quite a few  stages that  I  went through in my growing up that while being considered  normal  really kind of  sucked . I do not want my child to feel sucky if I can help it and if she  must  feel sucky, I still want to understand it so I can be there for her should she need me to be. That said, should all this prove so  mind-numbingly dull  you find your eyes beginning to roll back into your head, I again point to the above escape clause re:  sex  in the next section.)  K. So, for some reason my  kid  is hyper-aware of  who  is getting attention and  who  is  not  right now. She spent  all  week-end announcing that "so-and-so said [she's] not  the  cutest kid in the world" or that the waitress ( CP , stranger on the street, toll booth guy) "liked the baby better". Her hair would not  lie flat . Her socks would not  stay up . She wanted  bl onde hair. She wanted  long  hair. The cats wouldn't  leave her alone  then they  wouldn't play with her .  Lu  was touching her chair.  Lu  didn't want the crayon she gave her. How come she couldn't be  little  again? On and on and on. Granted it was interpresed with relatively  good cheer  and her normal useful, helpful, interested self but  my goodness  I ran through my  entire  stock of "It's not a contest" type quotations within the first half hour.  THEN  she spilled water on the couch and when I remarked upon it said (in her  reasonable  voice) "Well, it's  your  fault for putting it too close to the couch. You should have known I'd spill it." Here is when I (sort of) lost it. First, I  cannot  stand it when people do not take responsibility for their actions. I  know  she's five and I'm  all over  the "allowances due to age-approriate expectations" blah, blah, blah but  thing is  this is the  first  time she's done that. (Not the spilling part. She does that all the time, but the blame it on someone who isn't in the room thing). Usually, it's "Mom, I spilled, can you come clean it up?" (Which we're also working on... again, not the actual spilling...). Second, when in her  life  has she ever heard,  ever , that I  expect  her to mess up??  Anyway. Basically we're talking a fairly standard "shifting of blame tied to an unrealistic analysis of herself and the situation" and instead of being all textbook about it, I yelled. I yelled at my kid. I  NEVER  yell at my kid. (Well, once. when she was  two  and she didn't want to sleep in her bed and it was three o'clock in the morning and she kept calling out for water. I yelled then too, and I felt  HORRIBLE  about it...) Sorry all of you who would feel really great if I yelled at her more,  not  trying to claim any superiority,  not  saying that not yelling is the  single best way  to raise a child, all I'm saying is i  don't  tend to yell when I'm mad at her and in this instance I  did . So. I holler: "That is completely untrue! Why would you  even  say that??" Following which she stares and she starts to cry. So i...  leave  the room. Again, what the hell?  Again , with the I  never ... Bottom line, I know the kid is  feeling insecure  and  needs a snuggle  so, I respond by  leaving  the room. This will  probably  not be something that   urlLink CPS   is especiallybe concerned about but I FEEL HORRIBLE about it! {Sigh} That's it really. We,  of course  made up.  Snuggling  happened.  Kisses  all round. Thing is, I know that, of course, these things happen and that it's  probably stress  but I don't feel like I'm  particularly  stressed about anything in particular right now. And actually, to be perfectly honest  that's what's really weirding me out. I mean c'mon, this is  minor . If I'm acting slightly strange in response to  this  imagine how bizarre it's going to get when  kid two  shows up, won't eat, cries  all  the time, breaks  Boo's  things and is  insanely  adorable to boot... now  that's  a situation! What happens when  Boo   really  freaks out and needs a milion hugs?? What's my weirded out response going to be then?? to move out??! Well, anyway. Just wanted to get it out into the world so I could look it over and see if i'm missing something (probably), just being really, really hyper-sensitive (definitely) and whether or not this situation warrants further scrutiny (nah...). I'll just try to keep on the ole toes and figure out a way to deal with this newfound insecurity on my  Bubbaloo's  part. Hopefully this will be like the summer rains: sudden, swift, yet, in the end, fleeting.      The Ugly:  So,  Dirty Boy  calls me up last night to suggest ways in which I could entertain him. I suggest that he  break out the butter  and get re-aquainted with his right hand as 1) I have sworn  off  the  Boy scouts , 2) am smack in the midst of  a visit  from my  Aunt Flo  and 3) am tired and want to go to bed. He, as is his want, ignores the first and third and focuses on the  second .   Ever been in the  middle  of a conversation with someone which you think is going one way only to be  horribly  shown that it is, in fact, going a  completely  other way? (And that that  other  way is  deeeee-scusting !!) So, conversation starts with me thinking: "My goodness, this  new generation  of boys sure is  comfortable  discussing female bodily functions". Seemingly gone are the days of "Eeeewwww!" or "Can we just  not  talk about it?" Here we have  a boy  who is not only  comfortable  discussing the process but seems  actively interested  in the minutae of the monthly curse. My how  refreshing ! Only to find that what I took for  scientific inquiry  was actually some  perverse type of arousal ! eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww!  What  is that about???! First off, I actually  kind of liked  the days of  secrecy  and  tribal rituals  and  "menstrual huts" . It kind of seems like the  one  time a chick's  allowed  to be really uptight, tired, and not-in-the-freaking mood and it's  all o.k.  Is it too much to ask for  four  days in the month where it's o.k. to be a puffy, irritated blob and not have to worry about putting out?? Sheesh! anyway, thank you  Dirty Boy  for single handedly ruining my oasis of non-expectancy. You suck.

       First and foremost...  A  good friend  of mine who,  in addition  to co-parenting some of the  coolest  kids I've ever met and providing  sustained ,  kick-ass  spousal support of the  wifely  variety to the fabulous  Miss Bee ,  also happens to be one of the  best  persons  ever  to set foot on this planent is having a little  out-patient surgery  today so, just wanted to say my thoughts and good wishes are with you, pet! Hope it's no big deal, that you heal soon and that the hospital staff treats you like the  king  you are! Oh, and pinch a  nurse  for me, would ya...?    So, last night I finally got a chance to read my  homestudy . I was  supposed  to have read it a long time ago but what with one technicality and another I just got to see it yesterday. It's pretty interesting in that there, in  "hard copy"  is  you , your beliefs, your life, your relationships and your aspirations; in fifteen pages or less  single spaced ; written by someone who has met you  five  times. All-in-all, it's pretty accurate (although obviously  skewed  slightly to address specific issues that might matter to the  agency types .) There was one funny thread about my mom though. I guess in the interviews I kept saying she was " loud " (which she  is  but more a  boisterous , completely lacking in  tact  or  sublety  kind of loud). Apparently, though, what the  caseworker  was hearing was that she  "yells alot."  "Cynthia's mother often yelled at her...." Now, I'm not saying  mom   never  yelled but she didn't yell all  that  much, she was just  LOUD  about everything. Whatever. If I want, i can go in and have them change the report but since the  odds  of my  mom  ever seeing this are slim and since I'm  deathly afraid  of messing with anything at this stage in the matching process, I think i'm going to let it be. Sorry mom.

       Well, hello!  Another interesting development... not  in the my new kid department but in the  general world of kids : These two girls that used to live in the apartment below mine pre-current-housing-sitch, ended up having to move shortly after I did and I lost track of them. Anyway,  long story short , their mom calls me  yesterday  to tell me about the younger one's birthday party... "they're in  Hayward  now.. would i like to come to the party... blah, blah, blah..." It's been close to  two  years! Anyway, I'm just delighted that she got in touch. The girls are  great  and I was sad they seemed to have gotten away.   Also, I was reading over some of my more recent postings and i noticed that I seem to  leave things hanging  quite a bit. That is I tend to get all  outraged  or  obsessed  about something, write some long, rambling post about it, then move merrily along to the next bit of  life drama  without ever having said what the  resolution  in the last case happened to be. This, in my opinion, might lead one to think that I have a whole lot of unfinnised bidness in my life but I actually don't. I just find that the  act of writing  about an issue sometimes helps me  clarify  where I stand on it or simply enables me to release some feelings about it, once it's resolved, to my way of thinking it's  gone . Why write about it? Having said that, though, I would like to take a moment to clean up some  loose ends  as it were (keeping in mind that this is  rare  for me to do so  don't  go expecting it in the future!). Ready? Here we go.  Eh hem,    I did  not  take the  parking space . I found a space in a lot nearby that is cheaper on a daily basis, less busy in terms of filling up every morning and which accepts plastic.   I am no longer  mad  at the  Ex-girlfriend . I understand that she is just doing what she needs to do and did not mean any harm to me and mine. I accept that she feels she needs to live a life that does not include me and that as difficult as that is for me to understand that is just the way it is and as such I've accepted it and will now move on. (I wish her luck, though. She's quality people and derserves the best.)    Boo  is fine as well. Everyone is  just  fine!   I decided  against  the  Snake River  trip with  Miss Tail  in favor of a shorter, more manageable trip with the  Boo . (It was great, thanks for asking.)   I am  not  currently getting busy with  Dirty Boy , nor do I have any intentions of re-starting that particular aspect of our relationship. (It's just too damn  oogey , no offense  DB )    Dirty Boy  is still stupid over  Other Girl  who is keeping him on a very  short  leash which I happen to think is  hilarious .   Aforementioned  leash  is  not  the reason  DB  and I are no longer getting sweaty. For some reason  OT  doesn't mind if  DB  swaps spit with someone she  likes .  DB  and I are  not  partaking because it is  gross (!!) no more no less. ( OT  is wierd.)     Angel  is still not sure what to do about  New Boy  who is leaving on the 31st of this month. He is considering moving to  Austin  to be with him. I am  suspending counsel  on the subject ( BAD IDEA ! Do  NOT  move! You've only known him for a freaking month! What if he's a psychopath?!) in order to give him the  mental  space to come to his own conclusions.   I never found out who  Angel of Darkness  is but "hooking up" never happened   I'm still tired   Lyle has  not  called yet...  hmmmmm.... I think that's it. Let me know if there's anything else outstanding and I'll endeavor to address it (maybe, I don't know actually, I had turkey for lunch and now I'm a little tired...)  Oh! And before I forget, two other things...   Congratulations!  to  Boss #3  on his 1 year anniversary!! i've not met the significant other in question but I'm sure he's  stellar !   And   Happy Nuptuals  to our own  Sir J.  who is in glorious  Vancouver, BC  right this second preparing to get his  hitch on  to the lovely  Krista  (sp). All the best, my friend! Hope your day is  fabulous !! (Their  actual  wedding date is Sat. but the odds are fairly good that I will  not  be blogging this week-end so I'll get the props in now...)

      Here's some news...  My   Caseworker  just talked to  Rosemary's caseworker  and the field of "potential families" wishing to adopt the little angel has been narrowed down to  two ,  me  and some  other shmoe . Which is  great ! However, he's still being all  feet-draggy  about answering general questions and giving more of an  indication  as to whether or not I'm going to be allowed to see  Miss R.'s  file... Then there's this  other  baby, newborn basically, who needs a placement " ASAP " according to the social workers but her  biological mom  hasn't decided what she wants to do in terms of  re-unification  so they're (the  caseworker peeps ) all talking about " concurrent  planning" which essentially means that you take the kid and in the event the mom does all the things she's  supposed  to in terms of showing the state she can care for the child, you release her (the kid) to the mom. Buh-bye. If the mom  doesn't  fulfill her obligations then you adopt the child. Nice, but I can't do it. I could  maybe  do it if I didn't have already have a kid but there's  no freaking way  I'm going to let  Miss Boo  get attached to this new person only to have her taken away. So... where does that leave us? Not much further than we were before, I'm afraid, but at least it  feels  like things are moving along, kind of.

       Yes, but how much "dietary fibre" does this syrup have?"  Is it  funny  to anyone else that  Ghiradelli Chocolate Syrup  has " Nutrition facts !" printed prominently on the side of the bottle?? O.K. sorry, these are just the things one notices when one is not yet  willing  nor  able  to fully embrace one's morning.   Right, so last night got to hang out with the splendid  Lu  (child of the  best friend  who was off  galavanting  with the rich and  urlLink pretty  last night with  Chick 2  -- which, now that I'm thinking about it probably isn't the  best  pseudonym for the  lady  in question onna counta she's undoubtably  so much more  than just  one of the girls  currently keeping my  best bud  happy so p'raps we will change her name to...   "Fancy"  . Sorry,  Ducks , but I don't know you well enough yet to come up with anything  more apt  so for now, you're  "Fancy" . Welcome to the show! Where you from...?)    Lu  is a  very great  and we had a  fab time  and I am uber fortunate to have such  great  friends producing  fantastic  offspring that they then (for some unfathomable reason) allow me to steal away. (!!) I'm getting her on  Sundee  too! (Whoo hoo!)    Other than that not alot going on.  Caseworker  left a mesage yesterday saying he had more info about my  Rosemary  (but didn't bother to say what it was, of course) and also that there was maybe a  newborn  hanging around the offices as well. Now,  given my druthers  I, of course, would  prefer  my  Rosemary  (who is two y.o.) but in the  grand scheme  of things, if, for some reason I don't get her, I'm not really sure how I feel about the  uber-tinies . i mean, I  think  i'd be o.k. with the raising part (I  did  manage to  not kill  or otherwise  maim   Miss Boo  during her formative years) but I'm a teensy bit concerned about the fairly  huge  gap in age tween the two childrens... Upon further reflection though (and after having a quick chat with  Fancy ) I'm beginning to think it wouldn't be so bad -- less  immediate  competition and maybe more of a "getting-to-know-you" period where basically, since the baby just lies around all day, there's less having to immediately figure out what's going on with this person, what's already been hardcoded, and what is still open for interpretation and more just snuggley, screamey, messy diaperery cute-ness.... Dunno. I'd love to hear some thoughts if anyone has any...  well, I spose that's it for now folks. Maybe I'll write more later if my life suddenly gets interesting.

      Christ, I love  urlLink this chick's  writing!    from Entry dated: Wed. July 9, 2003   "The ones who get on their cell phones to cry to their girlfriends or proposition ex-boyfriends or call the sitters to say they're on their way home.  Like that one, in the lime green spaghetti strap mini dress you swear you've seen before. 'You must've wore that last week,' you say out loud with an exhale of cigarette smoke. She's on the phone dialing the one she's going to think about during her cab ride. You always fell for a girl with something you can't quite place on her mind. And you swear you've seen that lime green spaghetti strap mini-dress before. Then your cell phone rings.  'Hello?'  'Guess who!'   -- Girlsarepretty.com"

       Nothing to see...  I don't have anything particularly interesting to write about this morning so instead I will make another  short list . This one is of  some of the things  that made me  happy  yesterday:   Having  lunch  with the ever-fabulous  Ms. Q   Getting to see  Tony  all  dressed up  and cute looking in his snappy "living-an-actual-life-outside-of-work-that-requires-looking-nice" outfit (especially the  shoes ! The shoes were  Sweet !)  Demanding that  Mistah Lovah Lovah  bring me  chocolate  then having him actually produce said chocolate within one minute of the demand time. (I think he's got a stash... I may have to raid his desk one of these days while he's down south  screwing with the  urlLink cows  )   Hearing from the ever cool  Starbutt  who's currently  trying to exist  way up in Seattle-land  Hearing from  Pretty Boy  who got some   urlLink JOB   and now is too busy for his closest (well, maybe not  closest ), oldest (o.k., so,  technically  not oldest  per se ...), most drop-dead gorgeous-est (Ha!) friend in the world!  Getting the check-in from the  ultra-splendid   Miss B  who I worry about sometimes,  trapped  in that house with just the  babies  and the  voices  ...(not really.  Miss B  is  beyond  capable -- I just have this ever-present  urge  to take her out, out, out! Since I cannot, I will instead buy her  cute shirts  that are perfect for a  hot  mom out and about on a  hot  afternoon...)  and, fresh from this morning's living   Finding out that the soooo cool, ex-co-worker  SAH  just got moved to a place where he can now  instant message  me throughout the day (Whoo Hoo!)  What a Wonderful Life!

       Pirates!  Well, I  finally  saw it and yes, it was a  babe-fest . I have to say I was a little misled by all the various things I've  urlLink read/heard  about it. I think i spent the whole first  half  of the movie expecting it to be different ( hilarious , witty, almost entirely without an appearance by  Mr. Depp  -- someone actually told me he was only in about  30%  of the film!) but then when I  let go  of what i  thought  it was going to be like i actually found myself really enjoying it just cause it's  really  cute.   I was discussing it briefly with my work-buddy  Tony  yesterday and I think his was the  apt-est  of all the summations I've heard: " It is what it is ." I would add that I thought it was a  particularly charming  version of the genre but essentially I find it doesn't stand up well to analysis. That said, initial fight scenes were a bit too long for my taste but  boy-howdy , any and all "failings"were more than made up for by earnest  babe -ness, cool  costumes  and girls that didn't just stand around. kudos  Disney ! Good job!    Then, on the way to work today, some lady stopped me as she was getting out of her car and asked if she could give me a  CD . I thought it was some kind of  marketing  thing but she handed me a CD titled " Conciousness is the Key to self-worth --  Angela Davis  on 9/11 speaking in Colorado ". It's obviously homemade and written on it are also the words " Reach one, Teach one " and " Listen, copy, pass it on ..."  Now, I haven't listened to it yet, but I just gotta say how  freaking cool  is that as a  general  concept! Just a little  grassroots  teaching going out to the  Oak-Town  peeps! Listen up, yo...!  I'll listen to it today and if it's not  bogus  or a huge  scam , I'm planning on  making a couple  of copies to hand out as I go about my own travels. Let me know if anyone is interested and I'll float you a copy as well....    And  lastly  but not  leastly , big  cyber-hug  to my  friends  out there who not only  put up  with my  crankiness  yesterday but who actively tried to make me feel better. I'm  really fortunate  to have such thoughtful, articulate, (well-read, sweet, able to wear the  hell  out of certain outfits!) people in my life.  Smoochie kisses  to all of you! (and especially to  Miss Tail  who was instrumental in helping me access my inner teen last night by being just as giggley and silly over  certain movie persons  as I was... Does the camera  love   Mr. Bloom  or what??! And how about the "held hostage by  Johnny Depp " bit??  Sweet  Mother of Jesus...!) Anyway, Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

      This  just  in: my pal and "top-flat-in-the-duplex-directly-in-front-of-my-house" occupier,  Miss Tail  is  deserting  us to move back to  San Francisco  meaning that her fabulous,  LARGE  one-bedroom in the heart of the  rollicking Northgate district  in sunny  Oakland  (I  just  found out that's what the area where we live is called. The  city  put a sign up yesterday about a block away from the house) is shortly to be rendered  available . If anyone knows anyone who is  cool  and  nice  and  not a sociopath  who is looking for a home to call their own, please let me know so I can inform my fabulous  Landpeeps . TIA!

       take that!  Ha! I just did the ultimate bad mood thing at the ole in-house coffee bar. Noticing that the coffee pot contained  at least one  cup but (but jsut barely) of already made coffee, I went ahead and poured myself a tall one  without  setting up a new pot. I just left the remaining not-quite-a-full-cup sitting there on the burner. Didn't even turn the thing off. (I  did  wuss out at the very end and did a quick swab of the counter where I had spilled some chocolate syrup but hey, whaddaya want?! Have we never heard of  Baby  steps!!

       Warning...  I’m in a  bad mood  today. I’m in a bad mood because my ex-girlfriend  pissed me off  yesterday. I’m in a  bad mood  because part of the  fall-out  from the incident that pissed me off was that  my kid  was pretty seriously disappointed and was sad all day. I’m in a  bad mood  because despite 8+ hours of  damage control  including a movie, ice cream, and riding bikes the  last  thing my kid said to me before she went to bed was “today was a bad day… But, I love you.” I’m in a  bad mood  because I was awake  all night  thinking about how  stupid  it was on my part to think that a  pleasant exchange   meant that everything was going to be o.k. and that we were all going to be able to  move the hell on  and acknowledge the good things we could still contribute to each others lives.… Whatever. I’m over it. I’m through trying to prove what a basically  decent  person I am to people who are  invested  in believing that I suck. I am  particularly annoyed  that I let my kid be dragged into it but again, all I can do is make sure it doesn’t happen again. Forget the  tiptoeing around feelings , forget the  hyper-awareness  of where I can and can’t go. I’m sick of  spending a whole bunch of energy  trying to be a decent person only to be accused of being (continuing to be)  devious ,  inconsiderate  and above and beyond all else,  someone who makes people feel like shit . If I  am  that person then good riddance, you should be glad I’m gone. If I’m not, then whatever, nothing I can do is going to change that perception and I’m sick of trying. I repeat. I am done.

       Who says there are no decent guys left??   Courtesy of  urlLink the Stranger  Personals (Sidenote, how  pathetic  am I that I first clicked on the " classified " tab because I didn't know what " Personals " stood for. I thought it was  kink -specific...)   "GOOD LOOKING, $TABLE, 48YO WIDOWER   Seeks female companionship for possible LTR. I will treat you good--dating a guy with a Corvette in summertime doesn't suck.  8997"    I know it's entirely unnecessary to call attention to the cre8tve spelling but... what sort of woman is this guy after  exactly ? I mean, I can't imagine he's fishing for someone who is  primarily  interested in his wallet (in that case he wouldn't have mentioned the  'Vette .)  dunno, maybe I'm reading  WAY  too much into this but the fact that he says he's  good-looking  and that he'll treat his potential new flame "good" makes me think he really is interested in something a bit beyond your standard business transaction.... Let's hear it folks, is this guy just including those qualities that he thinks women are interested in or is he simply looking to exchange  cold hard cash  for warm, soft ... [the  obvious  rhyme is too crude even for someone of my dilettante sensibilities to transcribe, so I'll stop this particular musing now...moving along....]    O.K. now here's an etiquete point [This morning's blog is simply  filled  with questions that I'll need some answers to from  you , my public, so put your writing caps on...] Yesterday, whilst on the train to go get the  world's-most-perfect-child , I ran into  Angel  and his  New Boy  (who  was  wearing his cowboy boots!!) After a bit of the back and forth I launched into a particularly amusant story re:  something  (I forget exactly what but trust me it was  hilarious ) only to notice, upon finishing, that  the boys  did not seem to find it quite as delightful as I. I mean, they were  polite  and everything but the response was decidedly  restrained . I immediately demanded to know what possibly could have happened during thier  formative  years that could have produced  trauma   so severe that would render them incapable of appreciating a quality story, only to learn that they'd  heard it before . Rather, they'd  read  it before, on my blog. It was  funny  then. Upon re-telling, however it grew a bit  stale .   Now here's my question, I contend that the bastards should have told me  immediately  that I was re-hashing or at the very least, if they were determined to let me  drag myself  to the punchline, they should have done a better job of  pretending  they were at a first hearing. It's  weird  and  uncomfortable  to be upstaged  by yourself  and (not to issue  idle threats  or anything) in a way it sort of makes me think i should either  not write  the good stuff (making for a boring blog) or  not relate  it to random passer-by (making for a boring me). Which is not to say I can't be fully entertaining on both counts! I  gots  stories! You tell me you've heard one, I'll pull another out of the hat but I contend (again, still) that it is up to the  listener  to let me know they've already experienced the  money-shot  for that particular story and that we should please move on. Am I wrong here? what do we think?    Lastly, I've been on a waiting list for a monthly parking space near where I'm currently working for about a month now, and I just got a call saying there was one available. Now, what with summer (no school for the  Boo ) and the  new schedule , I find that I'm not driving all that much these days. Once school begins, in late August, I will undoubtably be driving more (maybe 3 or 4 days a week) but, even so, the fixed, monthly price is comparable to 4-5 days a week parking.  Benefits as I see them:   Guaranteed parking no matter how late i'm running (this may be key once the new kid arrives and I have to work out her schedule as well)  Not having to make sure I have  eight freaking dollars  every single time I feel like parking near work  Drawbacks:   Currently, I don't really need the space since I'm driving so little but I can't be sure another space is going to open up when I do need it  In the grand scheme of things I'll probably be spending a bit more on parking than I would have otherwise  Having a guaranteed space might make me more inclined to drive when I don't need to thus increasing traffic congestion, adding to the greenhouse effect and making me more stressed and thus slightly less pleasant to be around  Having a guaranteed parking space might make me a bit more inclined to sleep in which might lead to unpleasantness in the Nirvana I call work...  So, what do we think? Do I grab this space now or do I let it go and take my chances with fate as they say...

      An  urlLink interesting take  on the current state of "feminism"   "OK, the girly-girl women kick everybody's butts and always get what they want in the end. But what kind of cockamamie message are they sending? That strong, confident women who are not intimidated by anyone or anything can choose to look however they like -- even feminine and sexy -- while going about their business? There is something seriously wrong with putting such thoughts in the minds of impressionable young girls, and believe me, as soon as I figure out what it is, I am going to fire off a letter to the movie production companies. "   Isn't this what Femme dykes have been saying for years...?

       Exs in da house...!  Well, not really, but i have been thinking alot about them as a group lately. Every coupla months I send an e-mail off to the boy who taught me what  truly inspired sex  is supposed to feel like and he replied ( surprise! ) as well as sent some info on how to contact my  Alaska Man  so I have  Exes  on the brain.... By the way I didn't mean to imply that just because I was  thoroughly schooled  by... let's call him  G , that i'm dissing those who  came before  [{snicker} yeah, that pun was intended]. I was always pretty into the getting nekkid and getting my mack on but, let's just say pre- G , it was mostly  the chase  combined with  the companionship  combined with  the fuzzy, nuturing-type wuvums  that equalled what I  considered to be  "decent sex".  G  taught me how to  f*ck!  and for that I will forever  bow down  to him. Now, I  fully understand  that there are other bits to a healthy relationship and  props  must go to my  Alaska Man  for showing me that I was desirable and smart and funny and worth keeping around just the way I was with  no strings  or conditions attached and for showing me that it's possible  to break up with somebody that you love  but who just isn't right for your life and have that be o.k. -- an  equally laudable  accomplishment even if it's not as sweat-filled. And, while I'm at it,  a shout-out  to  Pretty Boy  for pulling me out of the  abyss  that was my life after me and  G  parted ways, thanks for the  support , the  sweetness  and the  amazing boot-knocking . Also, thank you for letting me live  your  life for awhile while i figured out what the hell to do with mine. To  CP  -- what can I say -- i thought that you were going to be the " forever " one and in some respects you are just not in the way I originally imagined. You gave me my first glimpse at the  heights  (and  depths ) a truly committed relationship can get to and you  helped me produce  and are securely  commited to raising  the world's most  perfect  kid. For that, regardless of whatever it is that you are currently doing to  annoy  me, I will always appreciate you and I will continue to support you in whatever ways I can ( Usually . If I have time. there's some  fine print  in the contract but we can go over that  with the lawyers  at a later date.) And lastly and mostly, my sweet  T . You are one of the most intelligent, empathetic, beautiful women I've ever met. I'm amazed I got the opportunity to become a part of your life and I'm grateful for the 3+ years of  unwavering support  and love you  showed to me  and  everyone in my world . Thank you. Also, I have to say for the record, that there were  other folks  as well who taught me a hell of a lot about loving and supporting and accepting --  Q !! -- that for some reason or another I never paired off with but for whom i will still eternally give thanks that they are willing to be a recurring character in the show that is my life. {sniff} I love you guys!!      Right, now that's that's out of the way...    Back to me! Quick  fill in  on the day yesterday... I had to scoot out of here  mid-morning  to take the  Boo  to a Doctor's appointment (she is fine. she's had a  recurring tummy ache  that we said we'd get looked at so we did. -- Very nice doc didn't find anything to be concerned about so all is good.) By the way, for any of you out there with kids,   urlLink Childrens' Hospital in Oakland   is the  best  hospital  ever ! Every single dealing I've had with them from the appointment desk to the advice nurse to the care clinitians has not just been  good , it's been  stellar !! They  rock ! they don't do  HMO  though so switch to whatever  PPO  your company currently offers and  get over there !  So, when I got back to the office  Boss #2  was all freaked out and weird about everything -- she'd been looking for me for  2 and a half hours  and  nobody  knew where I was! My timesheet was  completey screwed up ! The accountant back at home office was breathing down  her  neck and  ready to kill me  if we didn't get this  huge freaking problem  straightened out!! Whatever. Timesheet was fine, somebody in another office read it wrong (actually  Boss #2,  incompetent  wench , could have  easily  figured this out since it took me -- with her standing behind me -- about  three seconds  to check into it)  Penny  (the accountant) was  not  "ready to kill me", to the contrary we exchanged a few e-mails later in the day about  Kid #2  and Salsa dance classes furthermore I told  Boss #3  where I was going before I left... why do people like her  even  exist?? Whatever. (Gawd, she just bugs me on such a major level! O.K. stop. breathe...)  Heard from  Caseworker  about my darling  Rosemary . He faxed my homestudy over to SF DCP (Rosemary's  caseworker  is named  David Lee  so if anybody knows him  call him up  and tell him what a  great  person I am and how totally able I am  to provide  this kid with the  best life ever !  Don't  tell him about the  trysts  with twenty-somethings and the late nights with  Lyle , though. That'll be our little secret...)  Anyways, I think that's essentially that. Was  pissy  due to  B-2  annoyance factor but all-in-all had a fairly productive day. Get to  see my kid  tonight, so that pretty much ensures a  fabulous  mood all day today... we'll see though,  B-2  just popped her head up and glanced over here so i'm sure she's just figured out a new way to goad me into killing her....

       Still tired after all these years  Why am I so  exhausted  all them time?? I mean, it may not be immediately apparent to all of you out in browser-land but there is  not a single moment  when the thought of my  beautiful bed  is more than three steps outside the perimeter of my usual musings. I was going to try to go  play some pool  tonight but right now I'm so sleepy  I can hardly stand . P'raps I will postpone the knocking of the balls around in favor of turning in early for some quality sleep-age...    Saw  Beautiful Boy  today. He cut his hair! ( Wait , what's that sound?? Ah yes, it is the sound of  angels beating their breasts  in lamentation as the heavens become a shade  less bright ...) Looks o.k. I guess... (If you like  short black pointy  hair. Not that there's anything  wrong  with  SBPH , all i'm sayin' is if you decide to trade  perfect  in for  trendy  or  cool , well, there are those of us asthetes who are going to feel a bit betrayed. That's all.)  Rock on with your short hair,  BB ! I'd still talk to you at a party...! Also slightly disconcerting is the fact that  Beautiful Boy  was toolin around in a tricked out Toyota that had "Persian Pride" written on the front window. Disconcerting because, for some reason, I thought he was a bit more "bike-friendly" and because I thought him and  Other Girl  were Mexican... P'raps there are  two   beautiful boys  in the world??? Could the  fates  be so  kind ?? ah well, I'm sure everything will be made crystal clear in due time...    Have I mentioned I'm tired? Sleeeepppp... sleeeeepppppp... k. I'm going to either find more coffee or a plausible excuse to go home. I'll keep ya posted....

       I'm in awe...   Mistah Lovah-Lovah  just got back from a trip to  Vancouver BC  where he had this to share re: the fact that he and his buddies were enticed  to leave the house  by the promise of someone having some " hot friends " who would be at the club they were supposed to go to. Go  urlLink here  to read the full account but for those of you who are click-shy, let me offer this tidbit...   "Hot Friends"  This phenomenon rarely exists.  Any girl will say their friends are 'hot' but usually in most cases, they are not.  But stupid males will hope that the  3.21% chance there ARE hot friends will come true.  Odds are never good...yet...as males....we will still keep falling for it...because we are stupid AND we dont want to be the group of guys that say 'No.' and find out the next day that the friends were indeed 'Hot' and they missed out ...this will bring ridicule, name calling and general beratement of not only all your male friends, but those just passing by on the street who happen to hear of your stupidity. -- Mistah Lovah Lovah   Boys. So simple yet at the same time, so... simple.

       Oh my gawd!  I met  Lyle Lovett .  I.  met .  LYLE LOVETT !!!  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  K. So, I went to  Santa Rosa  to go see  Mr. Lovett  in concert right? So, I get there about  an hour early  onna counta I have no idea how long it takes to get to the  Luther Burbank Art Center  from San Fran and there’s no way  in hell  I’m going to be late. So, I’m early. I’m waiting calmly with the rest of the  shmoes  (for those of you  unfamiliar  with the  Santa Rosa  demographic, let’s just say there were six " alternatively colored " people there last night.  Four  were  singing  with the band and  one  was  playing Saxophone . Needless to say, I’m somewhat conspicuous.   Cue  Nancy : (Sixty-ish security guard, white hair, sparkley blue eyes, guarding the door to the backstage area) “You waiting for someone, hon’?”  Me:  “nah, I just don’t want to sit with those people yet.” I gesture toward the group I am sandwiched between – lots of “ fun ” jewelry and  authentic  Hawaiian shirts. She grins. I grin. We bond. (What up,  Nancy ! Way to  support a sistah , holla back!)   Thus begins a  rambling 30 minute conversation  about theatre, security guarding, living in  Santa Rosa  for  60 years  (Christ!), inter-ethnic romance, teaching, adoption, stage fright, you name it, we discussed it. Good gal that  Nancy . So anyway, show starts, I go sit. Show  rocks !  Lyle  is cute. For some reason I got this great ticket where I’m in the fourth row,  practically on top of the guy …. Since I know everyone cares,  Mr. Lovett  has a  GREAT  ass! Anyway, show ends, multiple encores. People file out.  Nancy  (remember  Nancy ?) waves me over. Do I want to meet the band? She inquires… I stare. She waits. I nod. She smiles and leads me backstage to a kind of outdoor area where  THE BAND  is milling around. We walk over to where a small group of people including  LYLE LOVETT  are sitting.   The following conversation ensues:   Mitch : (guitar player in the band – to Lyle) Lyle? {Lyle Lovett looks up. Lyle Lovett smiles. (!!)}  Nancy : This is Chick  Lyle Lovett : Hello. {extends hand}  Chick : Hi. {Shakes hand. I shook  Lyle Lovett’s  hand!!} Great show.  Lyle Lovett : Thank you. I’m glad you enjoyed it. ( Lyle Lovett  is glad I enjoyed his show!!) {nods, smiles} Excuse me… {turns attention to someone else}  Wow. All I can say is wow. Such soft hands. You wouldn’t expect  a guitar player  to have such  soft  hands. {sigh} I love  Lyle Lovett . Thank you, god. Thank you, Nancy. For those of you that care, I then turned to  Mr. Mitch  the guitar player and seeing that he was messing around with some  bizarre guitar-ey  thing and asked how many instruments he played. Hour long conversation ensued of which I remember  NOTHING . To make a long story short,  Band  was getting tired.  Nancy  needed to lock up and I was sent on my merry way. Got home around 2am. I am so exhausted right now I may just pass out. Yay! Did I mention that I love  Lyle Lovett ?

       my goodness  I sure am busty today! I got this fancy new top that I thought would be a  decent compromise  between acceptable work attire and  " Mr. Lovett  was wondering if you'd care to join him backstage... " garb and while it is, in fact quite fetching it seems also rather inclined to  drift . This combined with my new super-mondo-hold-em-up bra -- et viola, " Houston , we have  cleavage !" Hmmmm. Not sure if I should attempt to re-arrange the over sweater thingie so I'm a bit more cover-rard or if I should just "sport em like Beckham" as they are wont to say.... Actually, I've just noticed that I am starving. Food first!  Major decisions  like this one should  never  be made on an empty stomach!

       And now it's Monday...  Well, here we are again. At work. {yawn} I had a wierd dream last night. I'm not going to go into it in detail onna counta it was a fairly  obvious ploy  on the part of my  subconscious  to get me to start paying attention to some  key  life lessons and since I've made it my job to  avoid that kind of stuff  I'll not dwell on the bulk of it.   One interesting bit though, featured the arrival of my  future boyfriend ,  Mark  (a sweetheart. cute in a scruffily quiet kind of way. looked kind of like my kid's teacher  Chrissy-bear ,  who , get this, has been known to  skate  with  Dirty Boy ! Small world, eh?? Christ, I'm old...). The aforementioned bit also contained footage of my slightly  more future   girlfriend,  Milo  (sorry,  Mark ). O.K. now even if this was  all  I chose to pay attention to, what the hell?? I find it so bizarrely interesting that while my own subconcious  will  admit attraction to and subsequent hooking up with a boy,  even it  won't pretend I could sustain a lasting relationship with one. Although, in the dream, I got together with  Mark  first and was only introduced to  Milo  right before the alarm woke me up so,  technically , she wasn't my girlfriend  yet  but I think we could all see where things were heading!   Again though, I could be reading this  totally wrong  and I may instead be destined for a  non-monogamous-three-way  with both (Whoo Hoo!!) or just doomed to be with the one yet pining after the other for years on end (dammit!)... either way though, it's all  too scary  for me to think more about right this second. I will chalk it up random fantasies dreamed up by a generically horney imagination and let it go.  In other news, I'm  still  going to  Lyle Lovett  tonight! Whoo Hoo! Now  there's  a man I could commit too!!

       I suck!  Let me begin by saying that I suck. Across the board and categorically, I suck! After all my  whining  about how  nobody  wants to play with me I completely forgot my  very best friend  in the whole world’s birthday (July 2 --  Happy Ups ,  Home-girl !) and for that I should be shot! (or at least smacked around a bit... ){Sigh} Sorry, my best-est of all buddies. I will endeavor to a) make it up to you and b) not be so  completely lame  in the future. Forgive?? Kisses?? Mwah! Mwah!    K. Now then. Can I  just  say, integral lameness notwithstanding, I am in the middle of the  best holiday weekend  ever!   [For those of you who p’raps might be led to think that I  strolled in here early  to write up my adventures, I am in fact, penning this missive on  Sundee eve  still awash in the afterglow of the  best camping trip  ever and waiting on a pot of noodles to finish with their cooking. I  WAS  going to post from home but as I am  lame  (who the hell gave me a computer and why do they think I should be allowed to operate this type of heavy machinery??) and cannot figure out how to make my dial-up work on this stupid Windows 98 system, I am instead typing and saving and posting in the morning when I get to my alternately protocoled cube.]  So. Camping. Amazing! Splendid! Much fun was had by all. Campground was  fantastic , sun was out, gentle breeze was gently breezing.  Boo  and I found the world’s perfect-est places to 1) eat breakfast, 2) access the river, and 3) play a rollicking game of meadow tic tac toe using rocks and small yellow flowers.  Kid  lost  another tooth  for which the  tooth fairy  traded her two friendship bracelets. When I explained that there were two so she could keep one and give the other to a friend my  perfect kid  squinched up her nose and said, “Can a  mom  be a friend?” and handed one to me!! {Dying!}  How much did I totally need to have a million years of time to hang out in the sun with the  world’s perfect-est kid ? Very much, thank you. I am happy and content and brown like a berry. I am also, freshly home and showered and newly slim from all the walking and splashing and floating. Can I  just  say, I’m like eight types of f*ckable right now. You know the laid back, surfer chick “let’s just do this” type? The  sunburned ,  sauntery , “how great does every part of my slightly sore but still very tingly and looking for alternative kinds of exercise body feel” type? I want to  marry me  I am so relaxed.  This  is why the “booty call” was invented. Like  Lauren Bacall  in  urlLink To Have and Have Not : “ urlLink Here’s that bottle again .” Since I cannot find anybody, I will instead pray to the god of improvisation (you ever notice how the older you get the more willing you are to invest in a detachable shower head?) and find my blessed repose in that manner.  Oh , and it’s not even over. The  fat lady  has not even begun her warm-up on the  perfectness that is my life  because  tomorrow ,  Monday , I am going to see  Mr. Lyle Lovett  in concert with his large band at the  Luther Burbank Memorial Center . Why is it that I am so blessed? Hard to say. My working theory is that I was a  freaking saint  in the  last  life. Whatever though, I’m just about the happiest camper to pitch a pup tent on this earth. At the count of three you may commence wishing you were me. One… Two…

       the irony  Went shopping last night for a few  key , last minute supplies re:  the camp-fest  that will hopefully be happening this weekend. Spent an appropriate sum of money on the  coolest  and  most fabulous  of all quality campground set-up stuff. We are sooo going to be camping  large ! Upon arriving home and after taking the scruffily fantastic  Izzy  out for a quick run; received a call from my dearest  Angel  (why do I feel like a freaking  den mother  all of a sudden??) informing me that his  love , his  raison d’etre , his new  passion/lifelong desire  is (ready for this?)  visiting  from  Texas . I’m so  sorry ,  Honey ! I forgot to mention the  escape clause  that surrounds those who hook up at a  SF Pride event  and now my  Angel  whom I’ve  sworn to protect  is all sad because his  newfound light  is going home in a coupla days. (As a side note:  New Boy  has a pair of  cowboy boots  that he apparently wears on a daily basis. (!!)  How great is that?? Anyway, sorry… re-focusing…) I suck. Well, maybe you guys can write or something… (she says completely dismissing an earlier conversation she was having with our man  Tony  in which she staunchly defended her assertion that “long-distance things  never  work!”… {sigh} oh well, what’s a  den mother  to do?)     Thinking about camping. I  love  camping. My truck is currently a  camping machine ! I have the tiny charcoal grill, the mid-sized tent, the inflatable mattresses with the  electric  pump (because I am officially  too damn old  to blow anything up!) the folding chairs, the sunscreen, the ice packs (which, dammit! I just remembered I left on the counter back home. f***.  Ah well, at this point not even sure if camping is going to happen so will not let it get to me. Who needs cold food anyway??  Iced drinks  are for  wimps !)  I am  sooo  excited. Did I mention I love camping?    Let’s see… anything else exciting going on right this second??  Don’t think so. P’raps I’ll post later when I need a break from the always special stylesheet abstract I’m working on. I’ll do it secretly, of course, because heaven forbid  Boss #2  catches me working on something that has nothing to do with her and her  narrow little world … k. I’m not  even  going to go there as I need to maintain my current jovial outlook. {Breathe in breathe out -- smell the rose... blow out the candle…} There. Much better.

        So,  Mr. Lovah Lovah  was discussing  random, disgusting things  with a  buddy  of his (at  work , as is his  wont ) and the conversation drifted around to the following lofty subject:   “Which would you rather have posted to the internet - pictures of you passed out drunk with  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  “ defecating ” on your face or you passed out drunk with  [Specific degenerate friend]  “ reaching orgasm ” on your face.   Apparently the little circle of respondents was divided as to which was more categorically discusting.  Two  of the boys and  all  of the girls chose the salt bath.  Mr. L-L  elected the  feces . One respondent also mentioned that the girls probably chose the "emmissions" because they were “ accustomed  to it.” This is where I came in.   Chick  (4:18:56 PM): cuz they're used to it???! what the hell kind of  misogynistic ...?!  Chick  (4:19:31 PM): see, that’s  exactly  why girls won’t go down on you people. You have to convince them  that it’s a good thing  Mr. L-L  (4:19:42 PM): hahahahaha  Chick  (4:19:57 PM): you should  enthusiastically  choose the cum because it's soooo  great  and  tasty  and  healthy  and it  makes your skin glow   Chick  (4:20:04 PM): then they'll be more interested in the act  Chick  (4:20:16 PM): dummy  Mr. L-L  (4:20:45 PM): that is true  Mr. L-L  (4:20:46 PM): lol  Chick  (4:21:45 PM): i'm telling you, you need to talk to me  before  you go having these types of conversations with your friends  Mr. L-L  (4:21:51 PM): hahahaa  Chick  (4:22:19 PM): and why exactly did it have to be  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  performing the act?  Mr. L-L  (4:22:55 PM): cuz  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  is the one that will take pics of himself mounting us guys when we pass out drunk...  Mr. L-L  (4:23:01 PM): it's funny to him  Chick  (4:23:12 PM): I see...  Chick  (4:23:49 PM): and you still pass out drunk in front of him? Should I be doing an internet search on you?  Mr. L-L  (4:24:20 PM): nope...lol  Chick  (4:24:37 PM): can i post our side of this conversation?  Mr. L-L  (4:24:53 PM):   NO    Mr. L-L  (4:24:53 PM): ok..maybe  Chick  (4:25:19 PM): what if I write some sort of  sensitive commentary  to offset your  philistine  viewpoint?  Mr. L-L  (4:25:37 PM): let me review it first  Chick  (4:26:07 PM): I'll censure it a little for my PG-13 audience  Mr. L-L  (4:26:11 PM): ok.  Chick  (4:26:18 PM): sweet!  Does  anyone  wonder why I can't live without this guy??

       It's out!  My  Boo-ster  is a big, huge, splendid,  grown-up  girl and she has just   LOST HER FIRST TOOTH  !! Whoo Hoo! Good going, kid, you're the best-est!!    In other news: I am  soooo  gay! Forget all that  crap  I was throwing around in  previous posts ; I went home last night, had some noodles, watched my favorite  urlLink TV show , fell asleep and promptly had  a series of dreams  that would make a fratboy blush! I mean,  my god , it was like my subconcious had been saving all it's pennies for the day when it could embark on  an all out media blitz  championing  chick love ! wow. I'm still tingley. Anyway, I was all leerey and oggley at all the girls on muni this morning... I feel like a twelve year old boy. "Hey  cutie , what's  your  name..." Heh heh heh... (whew, though,  glad that's cleared up . It's no fun living in limbo land...)     Right, moving on. back to the  fabulous kid . Me and her are trying to go  camping  this week-end. I'm gonna head over to this sweet little site tomorrow and see if we can get a spot (fingers-crossed) then we'll probably hang out at the river for a few days then roll on back to the homestead Sundee morning ish.   Ahhh.... adventure. Relaxation. Peace and quiet. Trees. I'm going to be such a pleasant person to be around after this trip...

       It's begun  Wandered in late today cause I had to go by my  kid's camp  and drop off some " gym  clothes". That's right, folks,  my kid  calls me last night and announces "So, tomorrow I'm  going to the gym  so I need some clothes." The  gym . The  kid  is a  walking muscle . Anyway, it just threw me is all. I'm positive this is the first in  a long line  of causual pronouncements that will render me speechless. " Mom, I'm thinking of going out for cheerleading. "; " Mom, I'm thinking of going on a diet. "; " Mom, I'm moving to Somalia to track indigenous waterfowl. I won't really be reachable by phone, mail or fax but it's only for two years... "; " Mom, this is Brad...we're getting married!! " {sigh} At any rate, I'm in a happy mood because I got to see my kid an extra time and she's  great !    In other news, Our  Angel-Baby   got some  Sunday night although he's totally denying it right now. Apparently he  met a boy  and they "spent the night walking around the city and  talking ." Uh...yeah...      Had a great conversation with  Miss Tail  last night about this whole isolation thing that me and  Mistah L- L  began discussing earlier in the day. Basically, my deal is that I'm feeling alot like the older I get the less I feel a part of a group. Any group. I mean, I have my friends and stuff and i love them but whereas we used to sort of get along because we had tons in common now I think it's more like we stick to each other because we just feel like it.   There's a shared history there and a certain amount of trust and commaraderie; it's a great support system and I'm lucky to have it. But that  finishing each others sentences  thing, that ability to just go out and hang out and know the other person is having the same kind of time you are, that's diminishing as we all get further into our separate lives. And maybe it's supposed to. I mean the whole point of growing up is that you (hopefully) learn more about yourself and we're all basically unique so maybe the thing you realize is that there isn't a group of people out there who are exactly like you and you just need to learn to be o.k. with it.   I'm really beginning to think that relationships (friendships and otherwise) are mostly about just deciding to stick around -- I mean hopefully you get something in return but sometimes you don't -- it's that whole  better or worse  thing. Whatever it is about these people that made them valuable might morph into something else or disappear altogether but if you're committed to the friendship, does it matter if the person changes? Maybe it's just about staying present. People don't change all  that  much and the odds are pretty good they'll never completely loose whatever it was that was so compelling... I dunno. I'm babbling now.   One last thing though, I was talking to a  buddy  on the phone the other day and we were trying to make plans to get together and I was flipping through my datebook reading off dates which she kept shooting down (for admittedly valid reasons. She's a busy gal) until finally I got a little annoyed and said " You know what, just call me when you have time. " To which she replied "You know, if you ever  really needed  me, I'd be there." I throw this out there because while she meant it to be comforting and while I definitely know and appreciate her support, the whole point of me trying to be self-sufficient and drama-free is so I won't  really need  her. Does that mean we never get to hang out?

      k. i'm back. Just had to step on over to  Discount Builder's Supply  and see if I could get a little " contact high " from all the  contractor  types whose actual job it is to  fix stuff all day . (!!)  My adorable,  Lumber-cutting-crush-guy  is still there (sheesh, it's gotta be like  15 years  that he's been over there cutting up stuff... I love him beause - among other things - he's  completely sarcastic   and annoyed acting yet at the same time spent the  better part of an entire day  helping me  sketch ,  estimate ,  select  and  cut  the  wood  for my  kid's loft  then turned around and charged me like  1.50  "for cuts" which, for those of you in the know, is  ridiculously cheap  and really very nice. Plus he's got  sexy hands ...) he smiled at me and shook his head and I just MELTED!  Eh, hem... anyways (see, now I'm in a  crushy mood  cause  Professor K  got me all worked up. so I'm remembering all these  other  crushes I never quite managed to get over -- you know, sometimes I think it's harder getting over a  crush  than it is getting over an actual  relationship . It's like with a crush there's no "closure"... although, I can't honestly say any of my relationships ever had real "closure" either but whatever... where was I??)  Speaking of building stuff BTW,  R-B Guy  is back from his trip to  urlLink Outter Mongolia  and has graciously offered to help me figure out how I can turn the  aforementioned loft  (which is now supported by two corners of the bedroom) into a free-standing affair which is just  SOOOO  sweet and useful and stuff! {warm, heart-y feelings!!}  so I may just get to keep that thing up and around and in  Boo's  life for longer than i thought! Yay! Cute, funny, comes with his own power tools...!  R-B Guy  = excellent addition to the  Chick posse . Welcome to the club!     In other news, I got into my  Berkeley class  which was GREAT although I was less than prepared to be attending  UC Berk  during the  day , during the  middle of the week . Can we  JUST  say wall-to-wall-22-year-olds?? Shesh! As some of you may or may not know, I look rather like a twelve-year-old meeself so it wasn't (at least not seemingly to me) obvious that I could have parented some of these kids (o.k. maybe not  parented  but very definitely much-older-sister-ed them!!) and as such, I had the most earnest  young people  inquiring as to whether or not I "needed help" finding my "books and stuff" -- "stuff". A very  nice boy  in my class asked me afterward if I "wanted to go get coffee or something and talk about stuff".   Now I know what "stuff" meant back when I was in  high school  but I'm not super sure what it means to the kids today.... Anyone? Was i being "asked out"??? and if so, was it really bad to have  laughed  in his face?? (Seriously, I didn't  mean  to, he was just being so  Grad  student, and  EARNEST  and everything!! I know, I know, I need to  do us all a favor  and just stop it right now! It's hard though cause in a way it feels like I'm getting a chance to go back and do  high school  again only without all the  bizarre insecurities  and need to be home by 9:00...! Although how ironic is it that now i WANT to be home by 9:00! Hee Hee...) Anyway. It's light years different from my  Mills class  where not only am I among the youngest, I'm also one of the ones with the fewest/youngest kids -- interesting being able to compare the two....

       Do overs!!   First, before we go any further into the whole  craziness  that has been the last few days let me offer a HUGE, extended, shout-out to the  Fabulous "B" family  and their a-d-o-r-a-b-l-e  children  (and I suppose the  County of Alameda , as well) --   CONGRATULATIONS   on the  official recognition  of parenting ability vis a vis the  Ms. B  and your sweet-teen-age-before-you-know-it  Twins !!! You're the swell-est family of five that I know and i wish you all continued  health  and  happiness !!     Now then, the week..... Actually, we could start with this morning and track back if we like... yes! Let's do that! This morning, first official drop-off by  MamaChick  of the  Boo  and ... the Chickster f***s it up! (That's right, folks,  completely incompetent , that's me!) Locked  keys  inside the house, forgot  Boo's   breakfast  and  lunch , missed our  freeway exit  and was EXTREMELY close to being actually  tardy ...! {sigh} i don't know why she keeps me around...  Doh! I'm being summonded. More on my silly life in a bit...

       It's all about the book learnin'!!  First day of class for our little miss  Chick  and it was GREAT! I already have a  HUGE  crush on my  Professor  (D. Ketelle =  Hot !) which is very nice cause it's been  years  since I've gotten to do the  schoolgirl googley-eyed  thing. Have I mentioned that she's  great ! She's all  "older" lady  and  jokey-joke  and  smart  and  extended eye-contactey ... {sigh} we wuv.... There was one bizzare happening vis a vis class last night, I was looking around at all my  new cohorts  and I saw a  vaguely familiar  face which I just couldn't place until... (ta-da!) I finally figured out that this was the chick I had my very second  girl-specific crush  on!! It was about  9 years ago  and we were both working at  urlLink TRoT  -- actually, she left soon after I started and I ended up getting her job as  Production Assistant ... We had this raving  ASS  for a  boss  and he told me she was gay so I spent the  rest of our time together  trying to hit on her... She's one of those  shy, retiring types  so I think we can all predict how well that went over! I never found out if she really was bent or not. (Right this second she's  married  with a  new baby  but I'm coming to find that doesn't really mean much...)  Anyway, it was interesting/wierd to talk to her again. She's still  pretty cute  in that shy retiring way but I'm not as attracted to those types anymore. The girl sitting NEXT to me though...! Now THERE's someone I'd like to be my " study partner " heh heh heh...  Leaving at 11:30 today to go see if I can get into my  second class  at  Berk.  I'm actually not going to be so sad if I don't since I'm temporarily signed up for a Wed. eve class with the delicious  Prof. K . so I'm thinking it'll work out either way.  Prof. K  is shorter than me (a fact which I do not usually find all that appealing but I gotta say when a cute little professor grins up at you and says "Welcome, Cynthia!" well, gosh darn it, it's hard not to get a little melt-y...!) Hee Hee!  Let's see... what else...? I think that's it fer now. I'll try to check in after the Berk class and give a quick update. Til then, I expect everyone to be on their very BEST behavior! Kisses n' stuff!

       Who writes these things...?    Aquarius  - Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) 8/26/2003 A friend from a distant state or foreign country whom you may not have seen for a while could awaken strange new feelings in you for which you're totally unprepared, dear Aquarius. You may even see this person as a potential romantic partner. What you do about it, of course, depends on your situation. However, it probably isn't a good idea to pursue this attraction today. It may pass. Wait a few days, and if it's still there, well, who knows...   Ha! Sooooo, too late! And  on that note , thank you, my darling  Dirty Boy  for the "wake-up call" this morn. And for the books! You are a  boy  among  men  and I like you all the more for it!     eh, hem... Now then, main point of this morning's posting (which may or may not turn out to simply be an  extended rationalization  designed to cover the fact that I am proving to be completely unable to keep my filthy paws off the baby brother of a  dear old friend , but, as with everything else, we shall see shalln't we...)   oh! but before we get into that, can I  just  say, yesterday I went to meet  CP  and the  Boo  for the post-first-day-as-a-first-grader debriefing and in picking up aformentioned child (whilst she was off scampering around the playground one last time) I found myself embroiled in a conversation with  two ladies  about the "original"  urlLink Bratz  dolls vis a vis the  urlLink newer   urlLink introductions . Did I mention that these girls were  7  and  9  respectively? Did I mention that  Boo  was  NOWHERE  near the discussion area and that when she did finally come running up, backpack in place, ready to go, I made her  wait  whilst I  clarified a point  or two regarding a hertofore unknown  urlLink addition  to the pack(!!) I swear, there is something so intrinsically  wrong  with me it's almost a shame we can't map it on the human genome and start selecting against it in our unborn children. Anyway.... where was I?????     ah, yes, my theory of connection or what I like to call the " Connection Continuum " [jot that down folks and remember, when you see it showing up on  Dr. Phil , you saw it  here  first!]  K. essentially what we are talking about is this. I'm thinking that everyone (and by  everyone , I mean  me ) has an  established set  of ways in which they connect. Now I'm not saying that they necessarily have an established set of rules by which they become  attracted  or otherwise  induced  to connect (although, I'm working that  theory  out as well...) but that once they've decided that  connection  is what they're after then there is a  pattern  to the various things they do in which to derive the  greatest amount of satisfaction  from that particular type of connection.   For instance -- consider the first date. There are those who would NEVER consider kissing/touching/whathaveyou on the first date regardless of how much they may want to. Part of this may be due to societal influence, lack of self-knowledge, having eaten garlic for lunch but assuming that none of these is the overwhelming factor, I would posit that once a person has decided that a connection would be appropriate there is a script (or as we shall see upon  further explication ) a series of scriptlets which they follow that are essentially the same practically regardless of the individual who inspired them.   Now let me be perfectly clear. If I happen to find  a person  attractive due to their  devastating wit  and in finding them attractive I decide I would like to continue talking to them this is  not  to say that if I happen upon  another individual  who happens to have the  nicest tits  I've ever seen that my immediate response toward  her  will be to commence with the chinwag.... What I mean by  scriptlets  is that while I think that different people will arouse different reactions I think it's fair to say that the way in which I  choose to react  to someone with a beautiful body is probably going to be  pretty close  to the way in which I respond to an entirely different person who also has a beautiful (albeit differently beautiful) body. I'm talking about  pattern-making , people, and I don't necessarily think is a bad thing. What  is  bad (and here's one of the places where  everybody gets it wrong ) is not having enough recognized patterns to cover the full spectrum of connection and so being forced to apply a pattern that may not be appropriate to the situation simply because it is familiar.  The way I see it, connection can best be described as a  spectrum . At the one end (let's say the  red  end) you have  pure unadulterated lust . At the other (the blue) you have the pristine clarity of  platonic attachment .  The first thing to note is that one cannot say that red is  better  than blue or vice versa. One may  prefer  the red tones to the blue but that's fairly situational in my opinion. The other thing to note would be that while there may be  variances in intensity , there is no  inherent escalation  in the spectrum. Red does not HAVE to turn into blue. It  might . Then again it might not, but it's not a predetermined path by which one should be made to  feel bad  if things aren't "moving along" there is no "along" there is only the  continuum .   So then, here we have our  continuum  and our  patterns of behavior . My contention is that, should a person, for whatever reason touch down in a particular spot on our continuum we will pull out whichever behavior we know will give us the most  satisfactory interaction  for that color. Case in point: My beautiful  Dirty Boy  weighs in at a fair to moderately intense red-orange. Given that this is where he falls I think that it is fine to just freaking  jump  on him instead of trying to treat him like I would a  green-y blue  acquaintance wherein I might try to have some deep intellectual conversation with him vis a vis my fears around flunking school, screwing up both of my eventual kid's lives and completely f***ing up at work thus getting my ass  severely  reprimanded,  embarrassed  beyond belief, and  eventually fired  (a conversation which I  guarantee  you he has no interest  in  nor aptitude  for ). Again, not to say that  DB  is simply good for the  one type  of interaction. I am a  flexible ,  open-minded  gal and the  continuum  is just that. Any person invited into my personal  connection arena  is more than welcome to exercise  any and all latitude  in exploring its  prodigious length .   One  key  point here, however is that there is  not  a great deal changeablility in regards to  girth . I am who I am and I will react to one  intense violet blue  in approximately the same way (allowing for SOME variance in circumstance etc.) as I would  another violet-blue . That is to say, I will get  hugely possessive  of you and try to  take care of every single aspect  of your life to the point where (unless you are a  five year old child ) it may actually prove fairly  insufferable . This is how I am with my  violet blues . If you  want  to be a  violet blue  yet at the same time expect me to be  somewhat relaxed  about my  deathgrip  on your life, it, simply put, just ain't going to happen.  Green-y blues  have an easier time. While I may still sort of assume I own you, I'll at least let you have the time and space to live your own damn life (provided you  update me constantly  and there is at least  tacit  agreement that it's only a  serious fluke  of happenstance that your life isn't  completely  revolving around me.)  I guess my  key point  here though, is that  regardless  of the place you happen to be on the violet end of that continuum, there WILL be a measure of ownership on my part. That's what I mean by  patterns . Interestingly enough, I'm not particularly possessive of my  Reds . I think one thing that may happen in my life is that I end up in a relationship with someone who's mostly  purple  (that being a mix of blue and red for all you non-"creative" types) and that they may  assign an aspect  of how I'm acting (e.g. possessive) to the  red  (sex) side when, in fact, the  redder it gets  the  less  likely I am to demand fidelity...  But I guess that's just grit for another mill....  Anyways. I'm tired of writing and that's really the gist of it. Just some of what I was thinking on my drive in this morning. Thoughts? Anyone...?

       I'm baaaaccccckkkkk!  Quick show of hands,  who missed me?!! Well, my goodness, I sure am thrilled to be back and posting and all of that! Whew... where to begin...??!     Let's start with a quick shout out to  Pretty Boy  who is sweet and adorable; who I love like a brother (well, not  exactly  like a brother. Maybe more like a  step -brother... or a cousin...  second  cousin... eh, hem... anyways) and who I will always value as a contributing member to my  life  and  happiness  {sniff. Wipe eye...} and whom I was momentarily annoyed at for seemingly blowing me off but with whom I have since made it completely up with... (did that make sense? Oh, well, you know what I mean.)     Next, much love and  "feel better"  thoughts go out to my sad, sick, little buddy  Q  who is dying right now and soooo deserves not to be (again with the playing fast and loose with the English language...  Professor Zimmerman  at SFSU would be so dissapointed...!) Hope you're doing better and that the life is not so overwhelming as to make it impossible for you to get the rest you need.  As always, let me know if I can do anything to help.  Kisses !     As far as  Boo  news goes -- extended week-end with her was  FABULOUS  -- very  sunny  and  relaxed . Not nearly long enough!  First day of school  for my great big  1st Grader  is today and this morning's drop-off was a bit  mixed . Initially we had lots of  big girl happy excited-ness  (not to mention long, new, pink,  ponytails  and a fancy new purple  back-to-school outfit !) but upon arriving in  class  and being introduced to our  new teacher  (who seems very nice -- very  focused  if you get my drift) we had a  classmate  of ours, who we knew from  Kindergarten  mention that our  fancy new ponytails  looked "crazy" which we took  badly  and then proceeded to cry. No worries though.  Parents  were  consulted , assurances were made ( insulting child  was  immediately  dispatched to the area where "all-who-harm-or-worry-my-kid" are summarily killed -- his mom is  young , she can have more...!) and my little  trooper  went back to the mat to begin her  first learning day . All-in-all I thought the whole thing went quite well.  CP  had some reservations (she had some misgivings about allowing  Miss Boo  to make decisions which might lead to her being  teased , like for instance if she wants long, pink hair; wherein I am  quite comfortable  with the idea since, truth be told, I'm all OVAH doing  whatever you want  with your self -- so long as it's age-appropriate -- even if it means there are  those in the world  who may make fun of you but, being both  respectful  and  supportive , I  did  take note of  CP's  concerns and if the teasing/unhappiness continues, am o.k. with  Miss Boo  returning to her former hairstyle earlier than planned...)  {sigh}My little bub! She's just growing up so fast!

       aaarrrrggggg!  I just  totally  disapointed my kid! Gawd, I suck!!   See, we had made this "spill" -- white glue, tempra paint, flour and an Odwalla bottle -- and it was supposed to take  48 hours  to dry and  Boo  was going to her  CP's  house for three days and so we had this  BIG  plan for me to take the spill with me to work (today) and to bring it when I went to go pick her up from  CP's  house  tonight  so she could  pretend  she'd spilled her odwalla in her room and we could watch  CP  freak out... which is a GREAT plan except  CP  called me last night and said she was going to bring  Boo  to me in  Oakland  and I said  o.k.  and didn't TELL  Boo  and subsequently came to work sans "spill" and  Boo  JUST called me all  excited about the trick  we were going to play and I had to tell her that 1) I didn't have the spill with me, 2) the plan changed and I didn't tell her and 3) since I didn't have the spill here with me the  soonest  we could play the trick is SUNDAY which is  AGES  away and now she is  completely  disappointed and sad and it's ALL my fault!!!!!!!! Add to that the fact that I tried to make her feel better by saying "Well, how about this. When we get home I'll play frisbee with you..." to which she replied in an insanely tiny, wounded voice "Will you play with me more than you  usually  do?" AAAARRRRGGGGGGGG! Me=SUCK!!!!!

       Permanent Partner's Act  [This is also from  So-called Lesbian's  site but I thought it was important enough to reprint in it's -- mostly -- entirety. Cheers!]   "Five US Senators have recently introduced the  Permanent Partners Immigration Act . This bill, if enacted into law, will allow same sex non-native partners to stay in the united states with thier US citizen partner. The information is below. Please read this and contact your Senator immediately. This Act will  not  cost American taxpayers anything, yet to bi-national couples, it will give something most people take for granted -- security.  Please do what you can. And most especially, please talk to your family and friends and let them know how important this Act is to same-sex bi-national couples.   What you can do:   Please  urlLink contact  your  Senator  and urge him or her to cosponsor the  Permanent Partners Immigration Act  (PPIA), which would allow U.S. citizens and permanent residents to sponsor their same-sex partners for immigration to the United States. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Senate version of the bill (S.1510) on July 31, 2003, with five original sponsors: Senators Mark Dayton (D-MN), Russell Feingold (D-WI), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), and John Kerry (D-MA).   PPIA's History:   In February of 2000, Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) introduced PPIA in the U.S. House of Representatives. With the assistance of LGIRTF, Congressman Nadler's office drafted the bill, and it gained 59 cosponsors in its first year in the House of Representatives. On February 14, 2001, PPIA was reintroduced in the 107th Congressional session where it received 106 cosponsors. The bill was reintroduced again in the 108th Congressional session on February 13, 2003, and it currently has 115 cosponsors.  In a questionnaire distributed by the Human Rights Campaign, seven of the nine Democratic Presidential candidates said they would support PPIA, and two candidates --both are U.S. Senators --said they were undecided. Now is the time to help your Senator decide to support PPIA by taking action!   How does PPIA work?   PPIA would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by adding the term " permanent partner " in sections where "spouse" currently appears, thus ensuring that a non-citizen permanent partner may receive the same immigration benefits that a non-citizen spouse now receives. Under PPIA, a person may qualify as the permanent partner of a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident if, among other things, he or she is:   At least 18 years of age   In an intimate relationship with the sponsoring adult U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident in which both parties intend a lifelong commitment   Financially interdependent with that person   Not married or in a permanent partnership with anyone other than that person; and   Unable to contract with that person a marriage that is recognized under the INA.   To find out the name and contact information for your Senator visit this  urlLink website  and enter your zip + 4.  Further reading on the  PPIA   urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ."  Thanks!

       Can't we all just geek along??   urlLink This  is cool. ["Pond" is especially beautiful.]    Got a "date" with  Pretty Boy  this week-end. We're going to go eat. I dunno what it is about me and him and the eating; I'm not a big "eater"... I mean it's just not the first (or even  second  or  third ) thing on my "list of things to do" but it's always what we end up doing. Actually, I  do  know very well why I need to have a table between us  at all times  but still... if anyone can think of any other  socially acceptable  ways for me to keep my mouth busy, let me know....   In other news, the new  urlLink  Chez Lovah Lovah   is in a swanky-dank,  rha-thah upscale  part of town which I usually avoid like the plague and which brings with it a certain  dilema ... On the one hand it becomes obvious to me that the  Boo  will no longer be allowed to visit  Mr. L-L   EVER AGAIN  (sorry, dude.) but on the other... how's she ever going to learn what  not to be like  if I keep sheltering her from the "thems" that populate his new world?? {sigh} Well, noone ever said  motherhood  would be easy...    Speaking of me and  Boo  and a dog named Sue -- we are off, off, off the next coupla days registering for school, getting hair made longer and pinker, meeting potential little sises -- so, while I  will  have the  ole laptop   physically  WITH me I may not be  posting  with any regularity {sounds of beating breasts, gnashing of teeth and desolate weeping in the streets} I might though. Depends on how good a time I'm having and how much I want to gloat about it!

I just don't think I can imagine a better way to spend the occassional afternoon.... {attention drift -- snap back to reality} Sorry. Hormones again. I'll stop....

       The Queen is dead! Long live the Queen...!  Quick Quiz -  When you hear the term "Blow-out" which is the first thing that pops into your head:  1)Flat tire 2)Par-tee!!!! 3)Hairstyle (as in "using this new instant shampoo will add days to your blowout!"  I was reading this  urlLink magazine  and there was some recipe for "saving your  blowout " and I have GOT to say i went looking for  party tips !!   {shakes head} I just don't think I'm their target demographic.  Anyways, so {settle back in chair, get cozy}.. I'm as big a fan of the  urlLink goddess made flesh  as anybody and let me JUST state right here and now for the record that if  Ms. Jolie  showed up on my doorstep tomorrow demanding a spit shine i'd be on my knees before the "Nnnn" met the "I"  but , having watched  urlLink If These walls Could Talk - Part II  last night (I know, I know, it takes me a minute to get to things sometimes...!) I am so firmly in the  urlLink  Chloe Sevigny   as all that  makes life worth living  camp that quite seriously, I'm  no longer sure  who would win out in a "pick one from the jello-filled wrestling pit and commence to making out" type contest were I the  judge ... And it's not  just  that she ( Chloe ) is BEAUTIFUL, it's that she's  dressed amazingly !! We're talking silk ties, linen pants, garbadine shirts -- mmmmmmmmmmmm..... Why are girls so beautiful??!! Why are they so completely, decliciously perfect in every way?! See,  THIS  is why I have to stay away from them! It like an addiction... Where are the  AA meetings  for recovering Lesbos, that's what I want to know!!  {sigh} I  was  going to go on and write some more about gay culture and assimilation (there's a mini-raging debate over at  urlLink NP ) but I've lost all my energy... maybe later...

       that last post was a classic!  Trust me... So, I've just fallen victim to the ever elusive disappearing post!   K. let's see, there was something about the week-end being FAB... some blah dee blah about a picnic,  Boo  felt old... Gave  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  my truck... got sweet  check-in call  from  R-B Guy  who is living life o'reilly out in the  Great Plains  area (not really, I'm just not super sure where  Montana  is. I mean, people keep trying to explain it to me but I'm just not  visualizing  it. S'o.k. though. I  blame our schools .) Let's see... what else... oh, typed in conversation tween me and  Scary Girl  to try to ascertain if I was THE most  horrible person  alive and since I just so happen to have it here, i will paste it in again...   Scary Girl: You suck!  Chick: Sorry.  Scary Girl: You should be.  Scary Girl: Why did you even place an ad?  Chick: I don't know. I just... I mean I placed it in the boy section then I got all " Bi " n sheet and thought might as well place it in the girl side too...  Scary Girl: That's stupid  Chick: Yeah...  Scary Girl: so, what's the deal  Chick: whaddaya mean  Scary Girl: You like me  Chick: Yup  Scary Girl: I like you  Chick: Yup  Scary Girl: So... that's it. We stop here?  Chick: I guess  Scary Girl: You're weird  Chick: I know. I'm sorry.  Scary Girl: Stupid.  Scary Girl: So, I'm going to stop talking to you then.  Chick: K.  Scary Girl: I mean, it just seems kind of pointless  Chick: Yeah, I know.  Chick: I'm sorry. I really didn't think I was going to freak out. I suck  Scary Girl: YES you do!  Chick: See, this is what I mean. I haven't even MET you and it feels like we're breaking up!  Scary Girl: Yeah.  Scary Girl: K. so, whatever. Your decision, I guess. Good luck on your travels through "Man-Land".  Chick: Hey, this isn't about that! You just scare me is all.  Scary Girl: Thanks.  Chick: {giggle}Man-Land  Scary Girl: [anouncer voice]"Man-Land! Land of the writhing, nubile, young Man! Where men are men and women are scared!"  Chick: Ha!  Chick: Sorry.  Scary Girl: You're missing out.  Chick: I know.  Scary Girl: YOu suck.  Chick: I know that too.  Scary Girl: I'm gonna go.  Chick: K.  Scary Girl: Let me know when you stop being a chickenshit loser.  Chick: K.  Scary Girl: Bye.  Chick: Bye.  Yup. I suck.

       I'm here, I'm queer...  and I'm  tired ! That's right folks, I'm  still  tired! I am  never  ever going to catch up on what is rounding out to be  years  of lost sleep and dammit, I'm feeling a little  pissy  about it right now...  Although, re:  that  -- it is entirely possible that I'm  pissy  due to some  bizzarre hormonal imbalance  since i haven't yet received a visit from " my  friend  " this month. Typically, I'm like clockwork down there (arguably the  only  area in my life where I'm predictably normal) but not this time. And I gotta say, i'm conflicted. It's not that I LIKE the  pain  and  annoyance  and  puffy parts  but at the same time, having the schedule suddenly  decide to get freaky  on me just makes me think thoughts like "Well, you  are  getting older. Maybe this is what happens when  your body starts to decay ..." Nice. Anyway. I'm probably  pregnant . Ah, the joys of one bi-girl's life. Limited time only, win a chance at being ME! Line forms to the left gals, no shoving....      Kid's  last day of camp is today. She is very excited to start school again as am I. Have I mentioned that  Boo  is the  very best kid  in the whole world? She's taken to noticing when I do stuff that she considers "nice" and remarking on it. For instance, we have an  HORRENDOUS  ant problem at  Chez Chick  and I'm always running around with a  soapy cloth  and a  broom  and this  top secret Chinese "Ant-be-Gone" chalk  trying to keep the  little monsters   out  of the cat food, refrigerator, bed etc. ... So, this morning we're already in the car heading across the bridge when I remember that I left a  fishstick  on the dishrack (Do NOT ask). I groan.  Kid  asks why. I explain that I left a  fishstick  out on the dishrack and that the  ants  are going to notify all their friends and arrange a kick-ass (I didn't really say "kick-ass")  houseparty/breakfast/brunch  retreat wherein all  four thousand colonies  will march straight into the house and start  treating the kitchen counter  like the  US  treated the  Phillipines  in the early fifties. (Yeah, I know. I don't expect her to get  ALL  the references but it does set up some interesting playground dialog for later in the day... ) to which she replied "Well, that's o.k. [ When , I ask you, is COVERT invasion ever o.k.??] because they need to eat too." "The ants?" I asked, checking the rear view mirror to make sure that MY child (the one who will wake from a sound sleep in order to inspect the couch for any lingering signs of the tiny black bastards before allowing me to set her down on it) has not been replaced by some tree-hugging, hippy, no-belly-button, kid-automaton from  urlLink  Disney   corp. "Yes," she says having another bite of apple. "That was a nice thing you did." She then added "Let them have their breakfast in peace. You can kill them when we get home."

       TEH UPDAET FOR 2DAY IS IM STIL SIK11!1 OMG WTF  Thanks to  urlLink The English-to-12-Year-Old-AOLer Translator  for translating my standard bitchy, whine re: sick, tired, etc. into "Tween-speak"! We wuv!  k. so... that's it really. still sick. (flu/cold - damn you,  DB !!).... Stayed home yesterday which was nice in a snotty-fairly-constant-blowing-of-the-nose kind of way....  oh! wait! That is  NOT  it! two very important  bits of occurence  did occur yesterday -- first and most important was the offering by  Caseworker  of a  second  potential  Sis-for-Boo's  file for my perusal. This  lovely little girl  is  3.5 y.o.  and seems  completely  stellar. She is, however, already quite grown up and we've (me and the  Boo ) had a number of conversations in which we agreed that the  way coolest  part of her  big sister-ness  was that she gets to be the " big  kid" (kind of offsets the  crappy  part of no longer having your  room to yourself , no longer having your  mom's undivided attention  and having everyone in existence suddenly thinking the  baby is cuter than you ). Not that the  3.5 yo  is  huge  or anything but there's a very good chance she will outgrow  Miss Boo  in  the next year or so... which might be fine. I dunno. We're going to discuss tonight.   Other weirdness about this case is that this is one of the kids that is embroiled in the "high profile" case currently being addressed at SF County meaning that  this kid  is essentially the  reason   Rosemary's  caseworker hasn't been able to devote any time to  that  case... I dunno, I told  my  Caseworker that the whole thing feels a little  "conflict-of-interest"-ey since I'd obviously prefer  Rosemary  but noone is going to work on getting her placed until after  3.5 yo  is sorted out and I happen to be one of the  potential solutions  in  3.5 case  which  logically  (to me at least, I'm not getting the sense anyone else  sees the problem ) kind of takes me  out  of the  Rosemary  pool...It's all very odd... The word "compartmentalize" was thrown about a bit in terms of what I am supposed to be doing re: these two girls but since what we're talking about are actual  human persons  and that this concerns  the rest of our lives , i'm kinda thinking it's  not  such a great idea to try to "narrow my focus"... {sigh} Ever feel like you're completely missing something...?    Second noteworthy thing would be my  truck . I need to get it  smogged  and  registered . I was driving it to  smog place  yesterday when I notice "check engine" light is once again on. (It comes and goes.)  Nice smog man  tells me that he cannot do the smog check while light is on. I take truck to  reasonable mechanic  who tells me he cannot fix light because it has "something to do with the emissions system" and apparently the someone has to "check the computer it has inside it" so I then took it to the  dealership  where I was informed that it will cost  156.00  to "put it on the machine" to  diagnose  the problem after which I will get a call re how much it will cost to fix. Oh and BTW my warranty expired  THREE  days ago... (!!) So, then, let's re-cap shall we? I need to pay my registration ( 93.00 ) which requires a smog check ( 54.00+certificate ) which means I need to get "check engine" light diagnosed ( 156.00 ) and fixed ( $$$$$ !) meaning that i'm looking at  4-500.00  due  in full  by the end of  this  month in order to continue legally driving to work. In the words on our Twelve-year-old AOL friends --  WTF ??!!

       Gay marriage   Hullo kids -- there's a  quick vote  going on right now at the  urlLink CNN  website about whether or not  Bush  is an idiot/gay marriage should be outlawed via  constitutional ammendment  and while I personally am not in favor of  ANYONE  getting married, I do tend to think it should be left up to the  individuals involved  rather than typed into the constitution so...  If you have a sec.  urlLink trot on over there  and vote  "Hell, nah!!"  er...ah... I mean "vote your conscious"... Cheers!

       Gosh, where does the time go??   {yawn!} I'm sooooooo tired right now I cannot even stand it! K. Let's see. quick week-end update: Good. Very fab. Had less time with  the kid  than I would have liked (she had a fabulous  playdate/sleepover  on Sat. and a   urlLink birthday party   on Sundee so I got to actually interact with her NOT AT ALL!) but I did get  some  quality snuggles which, added to the delightful fact that I have her tonight AND I get her all week-end next week-end, suddenly makes it much more workable...  Also got to have some  quality hang time  with the effervescent  Lu  who continues to be the  most fabulous  almost two-year-old in existence! We three had a  very fun  breakfast at this  cafe/diner place  I like to go to. Let's just say a fair amount of " Sugar Packet poker " was played (I'm not super sure but i think  Boo  kicked my butt -- toward the end there was a suden shift toward  creamer/jelly architecture  that may or may not have effected the overall outcome....)   Also on Sundee, got to go see  Miss Tail's  new  swanky-swank aparte-mont  in the fabulously historic  Cole Valley  area where everyone is twenty-eight and nobody  thinks  they're rich! Suffice to say, her new digs are  tres cute  and  awfully nice  and I'm sure she's going to be wonderfully happy there... Yay!  Thanks, BTW, to all my super-dooper wonderful well-wishing  friends  re: the new job sitch. I'm sure you're all sick of hearing me whine so I'm doubly grateful that your congratulations are taking the form of "Good for you!" instead of "Are you finally going to shut up now??!" Anyway, we  wuv !  mwah !  mwah !  Oh, and one other follow up thing, re:  Boo's Best Friend  and  Lane  (aka sociopath-waiting-to-happen).. Some of you may remember I wrote this long diatribe about the  little monster  and my disbelief re: the "inaction" of  BBF's mom  vis a vis his continued pounding of  BBF ... Well, I've since spent a bit more time talking to  the mom  in question as well as just generally hanging out with their family and while I am still kind of amazed that that sort of event was allowed to occur I have (I think) a better understanding of their particular parenting style (let's just say they seem to have  a far greater threshhold  of "Let's wait and see how the kid handles it" than I do but I also saw that they -- the mom in particular -- were at the same time fairly supportive, so...) also  BBF's mom  when I inquired as to what the heck the deal was with "that kid" responded with "Yeah, I know. He's gotten pretty bad. I don't think we're going to let him come over anymore" which (although it is not strictly speaking  any  of my business) at least gives me the feeling that she's not completely oblivious to her kid's welfare.  Ha! She also told me that the  Little Sociopath's  dad is a cop!  Yay !

       Whoo Hoo!!   I just got a fu*cking kick ass promotion/move here at work!! Technically, it's not more money or anything (yet!) but it  is  out from under  Boss #2  (I'll probably be ordering HER around a bit) and out from the project I was on into a less defined, more "process analysis/director's assistant" role wherein i get to interact mroe broadly with the various departments/managers, work directly with the IT department head and basically create my own job out of a few amorphous tasks... Yeah, buddy!! Whew. There's been tons of budget talk lately and as lowest ranking  gal on a "non-essential" team (who also happens to be  SUB -contracting to contractors) it wasn't looking so rosy,  especially  when one considers that I am going to ask for a chunk of time off to begin parenting  kid-2 ... But  now ... Well, let's just say, I have a proven track record with taking this generalized "we just want things to work" type of position and making myself indispensible so I'm thinking my immediate future is pretty much a fixed thing.  Ha! I can't WAIT til they tell  Boss #2 !! I guarantee you she will flip right out....!

       still tired, after all these years...  I'm  EGG -sausted!   O.K. so I was talking to my  sick friend  last night and he mentioned how  cool  it would be to 1) get yourself on the  gubernatorial ballot  and 2) sneak out of the polling place with the one they give you (since it now that it has your name on it) so you can keep for posterity/show it to your kids should they someday  question  your life in politics/impact on affairs that  really  matter... An idea which I think it  BRILLIANT , BTW! He's from  New Mexico  though... does anyone know if you have to be a  California  resident to be governor (I'm assuming but you never know) and if so how long it takes to become " residential "?   And speaking of  sick friends  (and tying nicely back to my  header , if I do say so mee-self) I would  just  like to say that  if you are sick  and you're planning to  come to my house  and get your  sick germs  everywhere so my  kid  catches them and in turn becomes sick -- thus creating a situation where I need to  stay up all night  making sure  noses  are wiped,  backs  are rubbed and  nosebleeds  are stopped --  DON'T ! Please, I beg of you, if you are ill please be kind enough to keep your sick ass  away  from my house and my family and most importantly  me  because I'm already engaged in an extremely tenuous dance with our good friend  sanity  and  further loss of sleep  is just not going to help anybody at this point...! I'm  not  saying I won't come visit and  rub your footsies  and  bring you soup . I just don't need any new and exciting  germage   introduced into the permanent part of my life.  Let's see.... I don't really think there's anything else noteworthy going on right this second... Still waiting to hear back from  Caseworker  re:  Bub-2  (aka:Rosemary).   Scary Girl  and I continue to correspond. She gets HUGE points for  laughing  at me when, after she suggested we should maybe meet I came back with "I guess. But, don't you think that would ruin it...??!"   R-B Guy  is gone gone gone today, I think. Off to the rolling hills of some central state where he can row around in his kayak, ride around on his  urlLink bike  and daydream about all the things he's going to do to me when he gets back... ah, vacations! ain't they GRAND! Seriously though, not sure if you're reading this  RBG  but good luck and good riding! Hope you have a fabulous time out in the netherlands. Try not to get sideswiped by a truck.

       For the record...  I would just like to state that while I may be one of those girls who likes to  kiss  and  tell/write , I am and  shall continue to be  the  height  of discretion when it comes to describing other types of  fleshly interactions . For instance, were I to have had  SEX  last night I would realize that however slammin this alleged   SEX   may have been that this is neither the  time  nor the  place  to discuss such a sensitive and personal undertaking and I would therefore, of course, choose to remain mum. Sorry but that's just the way I was raised... "Discretion thy name is  Chick !"    Next, I would like to state that for the remainder of this week  Mistah Lovah Lovah  will officially be know as my   urlLink Little Korean Dollface  ... Cheers!

      Did I mention I have  ANOTHER   date  this very evening with  R-B Guy ?? The ever-fabulous  Q  feels very optimistic about this one (for some inexplicable, to me at any rate, reason given that she's not  actually met  the lad in question and is just going by the  skewed commentary  I'm feeding her.... I've got a sneaking suspicion she's on his payroll but I'll need to investigate the whole thing a bit further)  Q  very nicely gave me a few tips re:  not  sending him screaming off into the bushes -- at least  not right away  anyway. We also played a  very  fun game wherein I would tell her what i  wanted  to say and then she would tell me how I could phrase the request in a such a way as to make it slightly less demanding/threatening/coersive/scary... Apparently, it seems to be mostly about "tone"... Anyway, we wuv! That  Q , she's stellar!!

       "...If you're single it's for a reason!"  This said in an ominous tone by  Mr. Diva-licious , a-d-o-r-a-b-l-e friend of  SAH  at Taco Tuesdee last night. Uh, yeah... thanks, fer that ( bastard !)... Also in attendance were fabulous  co-worker guy , the  Writer  boyfriend of  Boss #3  and  SO  extraordinaire of the aforementioned  SAH . All wonderful boys and all  especially  charming last night!   Let's see, what else... Welcome  SigTau  to our readership! You are a man among men (and my own  personal blueprint  for behavior the  second  I decide to try to be  butch !) For every honest dyke there must be at least one  frat boy  type with whom she can discuss half naked chicks with  gi-normous  tits and you, my friend, more than fill that niche in my life. Thank you for existing! (BTW, if you continue to bring me the most recent editions of  Stuff  I will continue to overlook your fascist tendencies and medeaval voting practices....K? K!)

       Nothing to report  Not alot going on this morning. I didn't sleep  at all  last night (don't know why -- possibly the  hot flashes ) so I'm kind of sleepy right now. I'm also really  wanting to be touched  (not like  THAT  you perverts!) just kind of  stroked  and  cuddled . My  cats  were sleeping stretched out on either side of me when I "woke up" this morning and it was so nice having two  purring warm bodies  all snuggled up next to me that i actually stayed in bed a full  half hour  longer than usual just soaking up the  kitty cat love .  Meaning, of course, that I was late for work. {Sigh} why is it that they don't just  send me my check  regardless of what I choose to do with my day? What's up with the whole " strings  attached" way of working we've set-up in this country??! Sheesh?! What happened to the  trust , people??   K. Anyways... I  really  want to go see  urlLink this . It's opening in  Vegas  and it promises to be  flat-out amazing . I'm on the  mailing list  so they keep sending me snippets of the  pre-show preparations  (which is cool in and of itself)... It's supposedly  all about sex  so I can't go by myself (well, I mean, I  could  but I've been getting some  weird vibes  from myself lately so I think I'm just going to give myself a little room to figure out where I want this realtionship to go and hopefully to stop being such a  complete bitch  to myself all the freaking time...!! but that's another blog...) Which means,  in a nutshell  that I need someone to go with me who is 1)  willing to sleep with me  after (and possibly during) the show, 2)  not  willing to sleep with me but willing to let me watch while they  sleep with someone  else (preferably someone whom I find attractive) or 3)  willing to go with me and while  initially  saying they're  not  going to sleep with me, due to their complete lack of self-control/copious amounts of alcohol, willing to be "persuaded" that sleeping with me might not be so far out of the question.... So, there it is folks. If you or anybody you know fits into one or more of these categories and fancies a trip to  Vegas  let me know. We need to get moving on this, time's a wastin'...!

       now then, where were we...?  ah yes... the  week-end . As we all know the  peeps  were in town and  much hilarity  was had by all!  Thirteen year old niece  continues to be a  splendid  individual (there are  all sorts  of interesting observations that i made vis a vis her and her familial, seemingly-hereditary  traits  and her  dad's influence  and her  likeness  to the  Boo  but I'm going to wait to write about all of that onna counta I'm sure my  reading public  is  far more interested  in finding out how  date #2  went and whether or not the  Chick-ster  " got some "...)  But  first , let me just say  Sat. eve  out with the  crew  was made  especially nice  by the apearance of  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  and the always splendid  Miss K . who joined  the family  for some food and some   urlLink HyperBowl   butt kicking action! [For some  unfathomable  reason my child very much adores  Mr. L-L   -- also, I think  Boo  was needing a little  bolster  to her cool factor since she had this new-fangled grown-up  cousin  trying to  boss her around  all week-end, and being  able to summon  a cool fun adult of her own who had  no allegiance  to the  wanna-be monarch  pretty much made her night -- as  such , I am  especially  grateful to  Mr. L-L  and his for thier somewhat short notice cameo.]    Now then... the  date ... Actually, did I mention my  boots ? I just got some  kickin new boots  that I  cannot  wait to have an excuse to wear...! K. {giggle} sorry. {serious face} the  date . The date was nice.  B-R guy  [who actually will be henceforth referred to as  R-B guy  -- that's right folks  unlike   Young Lad , there will be a  henceforth  with this one...!] was/is super cute, pretty blue eyes, cute teeth (which, for those of you that know me,  pretty much says it all ), witty conversationally, sweet personality-wise, super soft lips.... eh hem....   Point at which I  knew without a doubt  that  date  was successful was when we were at his car and I was looking at this  Motorcycle racing magazine  (O.K. I was actually  fixated  by the  naked  girl lying on the ground next to the bike in the center spread) and he remarked on how nice it was that i was  showing interest  in his  hobby of choice ! Ha! "Showing interest"?? Is that what the kids are calling it these days? I got chore  interest  right here, heh heh, heh.... Anyways,  R-B guy =full on cutie and (because my life does not  always  work exactly the way I'd like it too) he's  leaving  for an extended ride across this great country of ours for a few weeks! Yay! But, no worries. I'm going to try to see him again before he goes -- besides which, I figure it'll take awhile for the  marks to fade  so at least he'll have something to remember me by, right? Ha! just kidding,  R-B guy  was a complete gentleman, a credit to his sex... {smile} eh hem.    So,  anyways , very nice time was had by all. And...what's the perfect way to follow up a sweet date with a sweet guy? Extra points go to those of you in the audience who guessed "arriving home only to be greeted by a snotty, feverish  Dirty Boy  curled up in a miserable heap on your couch"!  Janice , tell em what they've won!!   Yup, it would seem our little  Angel  wanted to make the  sweet love  with  Mr. Austin  one last time {sniff} before he hightailed it back to the  land of the High Hair  and kicked our hero  out into the street ! Having  no place else to go  (I can think of  four  or  five  places off the top of  my  head but then again, i'm not feverish...) ta-Da!  I  was blessed with a visit. (This is  particularly  ironic because I was  JUST  talking to  R-B guy  about how one should  never  let someone get into the habit of "just dropping in" to one's apartment when one is not home...  Funny  huh? Anyway, I got  Mr. Stuffy  undressed and into bed and pretty much decided that since I now had a  captive audience  I might as well  talk his ear off . (For the record,  DB  agrees with me that  R-B guy  "sounds nice" and this is probably "just what I need" although I think he may have just been saying that so I'd go away and  let him sleep  but whatever.... It still sounded good coming from an  objective  source. I'm going to check in with  Best Buddy Q  later on today to get the  REAL  scoop on what I should be thinking about all of this but it was nice getting to indulge in a little immediate post-date analysis...) {sigh} o.k. now I'm getting tired. Coffee now, more writing later, maybe...

       Two conversations...    Conversation #1      Chick: So, what kind of doll do you want?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: The light colored one [note use of the word "light" since extremely smart child knows that if she says "white"  MommaChick  will get all weirded out on her]  Chick: {getting all weirded out}Why?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: I dunno.  Chick: Is there something particular you like about the light one?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Yeah, I just like her color.  Chick: There's one that's  your  color. Don't you like your color?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: {shrug}not really.  Chick: why?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Dunno.  Chick:  {Quick mental perusal of STB6YO's friends}Is it just dolls or do you like "light" people better too?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: I like "light" people better.  Chick: {!!} Why??  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Because they say "I" like I do.  Chick: {lost}"I"?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Instead of "ah". Like "Ahm going..."  Chick: You like light people because they sound like you?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Yes.  Chick: But that's cultural. That's doesn't have anything to do with what color they are  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: ...  Chick: You know that right?   Soon-to-be-6yr-old: ...  Chick: There are lots of brown people who sound like you.  I  sound like you.  Soon-to-be-6yr-old:  Because you're not dark.  Chick: {?!}I'm not dark?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: No. The darker you are the more you sound like that.  Chick: hmmmmm. I don't think that's always true, Sweetie.  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: Uh huh. All the dark brown kids at my school talk like that.  Chick: Yes, but if a light kid is raised in the same family then they'd talk like that to.  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: {stares at me}  Chick: So, would you want to be friends with that kid? Even if she didn't sound like you?  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: It depends. If she's nice.  Chick: So, you could be friends with a darker kid too, if she's nice  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: yeah....  Chick: Well, o.k.  Soon-to-be-6yr-old: But I still want the light doll.     Conversation #2     Baby Brother:  What's the kid want for her birthday?  Chick: A  urlLink Bratz  doll. The Asian one. She likes it because it's "light"  Baby Brother: Yo, That reminds me, I just met this  African American Chinese  guy!  Chick: He was mixed?  Baby Brother: No he was from  China ! Grew up there!  Chick: So he's  Chinese ?  Baby Brother: No, he's a black guy!  Chick: But he grew up in  China ?   Baby Brother: Yeah.  Chick: So, he's not actually  African American , he's   Chinese     Baby Brother: {as if to someone who is really just completely missing the point}But he's  dark , like me...  Chick:  Right, but  culturally  he's   Chinese  . He's not  African American , he's  Chinese !  Baby Brother: .... Let me talk to the kid.  Seriously, is it just me? And I trying to make this much more difficult than it needs to be? I don't think my  kid  (or my  brother  for that matter) is racist or anything because we never actually established whether or not being "dark" was bad, just that it's different and that she's more comfortable with sameness, but she's definitely prejudiced in favor of light skin (and long hair -- stay tuned for the  gender-stereotype  discussion later this week!) and in her world (and unfortunately apparently in my  Baby Bro's ) if you look a certain way, you  are  a certain way. period. I dunno. I mean, I get that part of it can be attributed to the "greener" grass theory (Look at all those light wimmin trying to get tan) and that another bit can be assigned to random desire to look a certain way based on what you personally think looks cool ( STB6YO  also wishes her eyes were more "slantey" and that her hair was pink-violet all over); still another part knows that it is intrinsic to kid/teen-age/early twenties-ness to question and change and experiment and that expecting a  healthy and holistic total acceptance  of body, mind and spirit may be a bit too much to ask of a soon-to-be-6yr-old but still... Racism is so insidious. I just wonder how much of it is natural  processing/pattern-making  and how much of it is  society telling her what to think ? {sigh} Anyway. I'm off to figure out  "loot bags"  after I put in an order for a  "Barbie" cake .  My life is the definition of  irony  right now.

       Damn, now I need a new axiom...   So, today, on the way into the city, I mention to the  kid  that I want to get my  hair cut  this weekend. She says "Why? Your hair looks fine." I reply with a bunch of blah blah blah about comfort with hair styles and how it gets "fuzzy" and how I  just like it  when it's shorter, etc. She accepts this. Then later as we're walking to her class she says "I wish my hair was like H.'s" "Why?! Your hair is adorable!" reply I, forehead furrowed; need to instill ability to  frame a positive self-image /overwhelming  sense of disbelief  that my kid sees herself as anything  less than perfect  always, swelling within my maternal breast. "I dunno," says she, shrugging. "I just like it when it's long."  {...!}    in other news,  friend for life   Tony  just brought in this  urlLink book  about relationships based on  astrological signs  that is  creeping  me out! First off, let's ignore the (in my humble opinion  more than slightly  accurate) defining of my  week of birth  as "The week of Genius" -- here is the beginning of the descriptive paragraph outlining my situation should I choose to pair with someone say, whose birthday is... let's see... how about {choosing at random here...} July 2nd:   "This can be a brillant combination for furthering projects and realizing goals. The relationship lets it's partners know that they do well operating in a broad social context; together these two naturally take the lead in any endeavor, meanwhile sharing few tensions between themselves over dominance and control. They do, however, demand the highest quality both in others and in themselves. The realtionship's quality of nurturing and understanding hatches new ideas the way a brooder hatches chicks...."   Here's me and the kid:   "The Libra I - Aquarius I couple is likely to have a liberating effect on those with whom it comes in contact with. The emphasis in this relationship is not so much on the independence of each partner but on thier combined power to undermine authority and loosen the bonds of tradition - in general to promote a freethinkng and forward-looking ideology or lifestyle. Libra I and Aquarius I lie in trine aspect to each other in the zodiac suggesting an ease between them...."   Hee Hee!   Anyway. I'm becoming obsessed. Damn you,  Tony  for bringing this poison to my desk!! Must... work... now.... step away from the book....

I have a  HUGE  bruise on my  tuchas  from last night when I rather unceremoniously fell onto a  pile of wood/tools  in a feeble effort to make my kid's room  slightly safer  for her to occupy until the loft is completely finished. HUGE. all purple and green with a sexy red welt running down the center of it...! Yup, who wants some NOW, Baby!    In other news:  urlLink Here's  a seemingly cool organization that  Sleeping Beauty  left in the comments section. I read through the site and it seems like they're trying to do some good in the world. Plus the site itself is pretty spiffy. Go check it out if you get a chance and/or if you are or know a teen-aged girl in  Alameda  county.    Did I mention my ass??  Hurts ! Still! I sailed in here slightly late this morning and got  right to work  on one of my projects only to notice that I had an  e-mail  saying that I was required to be in some meeting with all the  big bosses  that had  already started  and that I ended up wandering into an HOUR late... Nice. Seriously, is there anyone out there wondering why the hell I haven't been politely asked to leave yet??

       Pop quiz!  So, I'm tired  all day  yesterday, right? due to  TOTAL  lack of sleep on  Sundee  night, so... yesterday, I get home from work,  exhausted , and, of course, being an intelligent, forward thinking gal, I  1) crawl immediately into bed in a somewhat futile attempt to catch up on the accumulated  years  of missed sleep i've amassed thus far  2) realize that although I'm tired, I am also a  student  and thus need to finish my reading which I do before crawling into bed and entering the land of blessed repose  or  3) Blow off the reading but stay up until 3am anyway working on my  kid's loft .  That's right, folks, I am an idiot! I am also officially so tired right now I  may die ! Ran into  SigTau  on the elevator, he suggested copious amounts of  RedBull . I am so exhaused I  actually  considered it!  Oh, before I forget,  belated shout out  to the fantastic  Lu  who turned the  big 2  last week and who is as  fetching and fabulous  a 2-year-old as ever I've seen! Congrats, honey! Happy getting huge!!  {Sigh} Somebody shoot me, please....  Loft  looks good though....

       the way high school  should  have been  I had the  best   high school date  last night! I was kind of out of sorts this last week (anybody notice? - quick show of hands...!) so my  Pretty Boy  agreed to take me out and  treat me like a girl . First, we went to this touristy restaurant in the  Marina  and talked about dumb stuff, then we got back in his brand new  urlLink car  and drove all over the  Presidio  and the  Marina  listening to loud classic rock and acting like idiots. We even ended up "parking" down under the  GG bridge  so we could ... eh hem... "look at the view". Anyways, It was sweet and adorable and it felt like a "do-over" of prom night  - cuter boy (with longer hair), sexier clothes, faster car, no curfew --  Yeah, baby!

       being black and being a blogger...  There's a fascinating discussion raging through the blogsphere re: the concept of being a  urlLink black blogger . I discovered it when I stopped by   urlLink Jason 's  site for my daily visit and I clicked through several of his links to other discussions that were intelligent, far-ranging and compelling. Having said that, I don't honestly think I have a damn thing to add to the conversation. I am tired right now and even if I weren't, I am far too busy attempting to explicate my mixed-race, bi-sexual, parent-of-a-young-child-al position to try to switch frames/analysees based on the occassional perception of where my allegiances might lie according to my skin tone. The discussion is oftentimes enlightening though and I would highly suggest that people stop by to have a little looksee.

       These guys are my new music review heroes  For no other reason than one of their reviews contained this sentence:   "It's something of a relief in these times of bands bothering to make decent music that pop's core values - ridiculous hair, pointing one's penis at a lady in a mask..."    combined with a  urlLink picture .     K. so. I go downstairs to get my  bagel  and   TEA   at around the same time most mornings. this pretty much assures that I will be running into the  same peeps  over and over again and while most are still so  completely shocked  that they're even  out of bed  that they can't do much more than  stare and mumble  there are a few who are quite  gregarious . One  gentleman  in particular palys particularly fast and loose with the  life story  and i  just  have to say, were I to ever meet his ex-wife ( Diane  -  who is "out there!"), his older daughter ( Sarah  who just moved out of her apartment which her ex-roomate trashed and which  our friend  subsequently spent ALL week-end cleaning up and who is now moving into a new place that is smaller but in a  MUCH  nicer neighborhood), and his younger daughter ( Stephanie  who just hooked up with a boy she knew when they were kids but who is currently running with a pretty "bad crowd" -- not to mention the fact that this kid just broke up with his girlfriend -- and who just recently told the aforementioned ex-wife,  Diane  about the situation and now  Diane  is "all up in arms" thinking  our buddy  needs to "step in"...!) let's just say, I'm not sure what I would be able to say to them.    School yesterday was luverly. There is a girl in my class who is a dead ringer for  urlLink  Alexis Bledel   who plays  Rory  in the  urlLink best TV show  ever! (except that the  girl in my class  is dark brown and  Alexis  is off-white but no matter, the resemblance is eery I tell you!) Anyways, I bring this up because I am currently in a group with  Rory's twin  as well as with  Coffee Boy  and i couldn't be more thrilled! We're going to be studying the "history of place" in which we make "an ethnographic and cartographic study of a location" -- probably the liquor store at the corner of Broadway and 40ieth -- and write a report about it. Yay, us! There is also an EXTREMELY annoying  green-glasses wearing girl  in our group who while I can't say  exactly  why she bugs me just does and I'm going to do my best to ignore her.      My beautiful kid's  Back-to-School night  is tonight which i think means we're all going to be  herded into a room  where we'll "meet and greet" the principal while our kiddies are  whisked away somewhere else  to play and snack. Have I mentioned the  sheer uselessness  of events that  separate people from their peeps  as a way to facilitate "bonding"?? Anyway. I'm going to  protest hotly  the  second  anyone tries to wrest my  Boo  from my grasp (unless, of course, she  wants  to be whisked away, which she probably will --  damn the  brainwashing cult-like mentality  at these so-called "alternative" schools!) Sigh. getting tired. going to act like I'm, working now....

       "Web meetings" - Informative or grossly generalized waste of time? Discuss...   I am currently participating in an  on-line meeting  that is attempting to explain to me why  Marimba  technologies is vastly superior to  SMS . So far I've learned that I can:  "enable complex systems while reducing human intervention for administration   integrate rather than change the environment or process  capture your business requirements and policies  enforce the policies and report against compliance  allow you to take proactive steps toward cutting costs"  I've learned this through a series of power point templated slides that progress at a rate of one every  6 minutes ! Ooops, hang on, apparently we are now going to learn about a "paradigm shift"... I mean, seriously , I could have gotten this from a brochure and at least it would have been glossily packaged! Criminey!  "Closed-looped, policy based management" What the hell??!  K. nuff of that. Big shout out to  the girl I like .  Thanks for the check-in. You're sweet. You're also quite safe as I have no intentions of moving to the  Portland  area anytime soon. That plus the fact I've once again given up on  adult relationships  pretty much ensures that anyone peeping into your window in the middle of the night (much as you might  wish it to be  me) is, instead, just some random stalker.  My GAWD could this "presentation" be more  boring ?????? Were you aware that  SMS  is  not  a policy-based system? or that it manges Windows and NOT your environment (Dur??) O.K. sorry. Just because I'm having to sit through this nonsense does not mean you should have to also. Although... what's that thing about misery loving company...? Anyways, I'll write more later after I've digested the  Marimba  sales-pitch...er...ah... I mean information offering!

       And the hits just keep on coming...!  Hallo folks, let's see what is there to say this morning...? week-end was lovely. Bagels with the  Bees  - always fun;  Boo  class = great (there quite literally is not a single thing in the world more adorable than 6 year olds doing acrobatics)!  Boo's new/regular teacher  is fabulous in a  butch kind of way  and if I was in the mood for it, I think I'd add her to my  crush list . I'm not though so she'll have to stay in the land of "cool people who I only really consider when I'm in their actual presence". Not a bad place to be, actually -- I'll bet the  vast majority  of my crushes might actually prefer to be switched to  that  list...!   Anyway. Spent yesterday working on the  loft project  with the amazingly sweet  R-B Guy  -- thanks you soooo much for everything, my friend. Hope you find what you need from life -- and it looks great! we made this AMAZING  railing  for  Boo's bunk bed  that is a freaking  work of art . The loft's not done yet but it's getting there and it's much less close to  falling down  so I'm happy.  Aside from that nothing else to report (at least not anything that needs to be aired in public) ... OH! Except that the plans for the  Boo birthday  are shaping up nicely so be on the look-out for your invites; coming soon to e-mail near you!

       I'm here...  but I'm tired.    The  urlLink girl  I like was born in 1984. Just by way of reference. I graduated  high school  in 1986. fuck.    God, I am just in such a  crappy mood  right now. I mean I'm not really onna counta all my  buddy boyz  are hanging around and  dammit  you can never have too many  adorable young men  in your life, but still. The  second  they're gone it's back to " fuck ! What the freakin' fuck??! Why is everything so stupid and why do I even exist and why am I trying to get anything at all accomplished given that it's just going to 1) not work and/or 2)  suck !" Now, don't misunderstand. I am well aware that I am  by far  THE luckiest human being on the planet I'm just depressed is all. Actually, you know what, I'm going to stop writing right now because I'm sensing a shift to  maudlin  and given the aforementioned freaking  overall greatness  of my life that would not only be silly and self-serving but  intensely painful to read  when I get back from another typically fabulous week-end. Ciao!

      so we're not going to get Rosemary. Her biological mom is sueing to get more visitation (turning her from "low-risk" into "medium-risk") and her caseworker isn't sure whether or not they should place her with the other potential family (the one that was NOT us, which apparently has no kids and two parents, one of whom is "stay-at-home") or whether they should leave her in her current placement with her Foster folks who already have her and adore her (but who are too old to be considered for permanent adoption). Anyway, sum total is either she stays where she is, she goes to the other family or she goes back with her bio mom -- C'est la vie, thanks for playing, we have some lovely parting gifts for you on your way out! Our Caseworker was telling me that now we should start looking at all the other counties' children and that this is all somehow a good thing. I dunno. I'm kind of sick of the whole thing to tell you the truth. Not like I'm dropping out or anything but I'm tired of wanting something so much that I have NO control over. Blah. This process sucks.

       Today I am in a fine mood  I really am. I'm feeling fit as a freaking fiddle, cute as hell (although I  am  wearing some fancy, uber-hip  pants  I got yesterday which, I shudder to say, may be a bit "young" for me -- low-rise, tight, boot-cut -- I mean, I  think  they look fine but I keep trying to pull  them  up and my  sweater  down so as to better hide both my  granny panties  and my "nothing-to-be-ashamed-of!" baby-building  stretch marks ...! Sigh, I don't think old is in the fact that you necessarily stop looking good in things but more in the fact that it starts to bug you when your clothes aren't "comfortable" Anyway...) I've got my tea, I just finished a very yummy bagel. All is good with the Chick-ster's life.    Class yesterday was fun. We got all  heated  about stuff. I actually may be developing a SLIGHT crush on  Coffee-Boy  but only because he's so  intense  about everything. i mean, my God! Can you imagine what it would feel like to have that level of intensity applied to yourself?? O.K. points to those of you who are thinking " stalker !" still though. In addition to pants (I know, I didn't really say anything about class but it's pretty standard stuff still. Clarifying but no real relevations, although my  Prof   did  say she's going to try to steal me away from  Mills  -- Hee Hee! And leave  Professor K. ??! Never!!) I also bought some   urlLink comic book porn   which I like for a whole variety of reasons but mostly because i actually  like  the  drawings . I mean, I figure if I'm going to look at airbrushed chicks doing stuff to each other it's only a hop-skip-and-a-jump to  urlLink drawings of chicks  doing stuff. Besides which, the  drawn chicks  can not only get into some unbelievable  positions  they can also have sex with  Vampires  and stuff, so there! Thing is, I'm  reading these things  on the  BART  on the way home and I'm struck by how funny the writing is. I mean one of the issues was called " Yuppies, Rednecks and Lesbians from Mars " and yes there were all sorts of women in  various states of undress  but there was also a commune of  yuppie guys  who were hiding out in the tunnels underneath the  New York City library  rotating the "usage" of a single  blow-up doll  that winds up getting  riddled  with bullets thereby forcing them out into the  redneck run devastation  that is  post-apocalyptic New York !! I mean C'MON! That's more fun than those stupid " My boyfriend and i have always had an interest in gardening, and since we have a fairly high wall of primeroses surrounding the backyard, I've gotten into the habit of doing it in  the nude. So, one day I was back there planting Hydrangeas thinking I was fairly secluded. Little did i know that my neighbor  Rebecca  and her handyman  Floyd ....! " O.K. so maybe I'm slightly interested in what gets shorn but still, gimme  Biker babes  with dragon pets and perky 44 D's anyday over " Beverly , whose interests include investment banking and skiing...!"  Sheesh! How the heck did I even get on this   topic  ?? Sorry, folks, I'm in a rambling mood. OH, it's been brought to my attention that some of you can't see the "comments" area in the  timestamp  at the bottom of each post. If you are one of those who cannot (and if you have a minute) could you please use the "talk to me" link at the right to send me a note re: which browser you're using -- including the version if poss. If too many people can't comment then I'll look into replacing the system. Tanks!  Confidential to  JT : Of  course  she's playing games, but have you considered that perhaps she feels like she  has to  to avoid getting  invested  and subsequently  hurt   Mr. Talking-about-how-much-you-dig-this-girl-whilst-having-sex-with-someone-else ! In my humble opinion it is  entirely  possible that this girl you like is not as tough as she's acting and that if you were to  step the hell up  and let her know that you  really  want to be her  main squeeze  she  might  let her guard down a bit long enough to tell  you  where she's been all week-end. Just a thought. good luck.

       First the politics...  Print out  urlLink this  mail ballot request form, fill it out and send it in.  From  urlLink Moveon.org  [which, interestingly enough has been blocked by the filtering software at the state sponsored place where I currently work. ]:   Mail voting is critical to beating the recall. More than half of normal polling places will be closed in this election due to time constraints, making many voters much less likely to get to a voting booth on October 7. Voting by mail is the answer.   This Saturday we're kicking off our vote by mail campaign with something fun. We're going to gather in groups of 30 to 50 volunteers across the state to hand out ballot request forms and information in our communities. In one day we will help tens of thousands to vote. We could change the outcome of the recall election on Saturday. Click here to learn more and to pick a place for a gathering in your area:    urlLink http://action.moveon.org/     Reasons to reject the recall initiative (I know I'm preaching to the choir but what the hell...) also from MoveOn:   10 Reasons Why the Recall is Wrong:    A single congressman brought us the recall with $1.7 million of his own money -- while simultaneously putting himself forward as the man to replace the governor.   The recall threatens to give California a governor elected by a tiny percentage of the electorate -- and gives wealthy individuals an unprecedented opportunity to attempt to buy the governorship.   It threatens to invalidate a fair election just months after it took place.   It sets a dangerous precedent -- if it succeeds why wouldn't opponents attempt to recall every future governor?   It's expensive: The recall election itself will cost over $60 million.   It prevents our elected leaders from working to solve the state budget crisis and other important issues by forcing them to campaign to defend the results of a fair election.   The cost to the economy is too great: a successful recall would cause enormous economic instability and loss of confidence.   This won't stop in California: 18 states have recall provisions. Unless the California recall is decisively rejected, sore losers in others states will continue to use this tactic.   The recall threatens California’s environment. Governor Davis has made important improvements to environmental law. Polluters see the recall as a chance for roll-back.   Gray Davis has made important gains in education, health care, the environment and public safety. The recall is an attempt to reverse those advances.    That's it folks. Recall = bad. Now then, back to our regularly scheduled program...

      I've said it before and I'll say it again, this  urlLink chick  is brillant!   The first line is, "It always happens at nighttime." The sixth line is, "Please mommy don't cry." Halfway down the page, the kid's hiding under his bed and near the end he's remembering a trip to the beach they all took when everyone was happy. The end is of course the kid pleading for mommy to wake up. Anyway, Mrs. Thompson will drop it into the assistant prinicipal's box before she leaves at 2:30 and family services should be on campus by next Wednesday to ensure that every step towards protecting the mother and child is ridiculously bungled, pretty much handing the father a handgun with two* live rounds in the clip, both of which will be discharged within six months.

       Sigh...  Quick, what's  the  sexiest thing a  hottie professor  can say to her student as said student slouches into her office seconds away from being officially late??  Bonus points  for anyone who answered: "I've been thinking about you!" team it with a  gorgeous smile  and we have  box-office gold , my friends!! Gosh. i just really like her soooooo much. She's sooooo  cute ! and little (i know i keep saying that but when a person clocks in at 5'2" ish there's not alot of peeps in the world who need to look up to her if you get my drift...!)  And it's not  just  the cute thing. it's the  voice . And the  hands ! the tiny beautiful ( short-nailed ) hands...! K. Sorry. I'll stop... She loaned me a  book !  Two  books from her  very own library . She pressed them into my hands, leaned forward and said with a  very  sweet smile "if I don't get these back, I'm going to come looking for you!" {dying!!} O.K. seriously. enough. Who wants to listen to me go on and on and on (and on) ... She's 46, she lives in  the East Bay , she's got a  son  -- she kept throwing around the "we" so I'm ash-uming there's a  hubby  in the picture -- probably been married for awhile, best friends but not really sexual anymore... Doubt if he'd feel particularly threatened if the  wife  developed this sudden "interest" in one of her students... at least, not at  first  -- Heh Heh Heh...(Ha! I wish!) She's all excited about me because she wants me to be a  City Manager . She says she'll be my "advisor" (Tee Hee!)! Jest let me know who I have to talk to, people! Time's a wastin'!!    Did I mention I'm giving up the  coffee ? Here's an exerpt from an e-mail I wrote to a friend of mine about it: "So, i'm jumping off the  coffee boat  and back into the  land of tea . i used to be such a COMPLETE snob about the  tea  vs the  poison ...er...ah... coffee  but I slipped into  corporate land  and apparently abandoned  every single moral and aesthetic principle  I had and well, i think we can all see where it's gotten me. BUT no more I say! No more reliance on the  brown frothy liquid  just to maintain some semblance of good nature; no more dressing in virtually identical "decent" neutral colored  tops  simply because they're clean and not torn and I'm too tired to care; no more "blah blah blah" about how I'll probably be here in  Corporate-land  for "another coupla years, maybe more, who knows" --  I  know, dammit! i will be OUT of here in  three  years, no longer! I will be  looking for windows  and massaging  policy wonks  in order to get my  urban educations needs  met. i will be  fast tracking  it toward  City management ! I will be wearing "smart", snappy separates with "fun" accessories! i will be a  freaking inspiration  and I will drink TEA!!!!!!"  Sheesh! I don't why some people even talk to me anymore....    *                    *                    *    shari wrote: Well, I'm certainly going to stop talking to you. No more coffee. Jeeesh !

      I love  urlLink this  girl...  Reason one: I like the way she writes. e.g. "my beekeeping professor acts so smug about honeybees, like he invented them or something."  Reason two: She lives in Maine or someplace obscure like that but also has managed to create and maintain a crush on a tweedy, "older" Professor person named "Zimmerman"! We are sooo obviously separated-at-birth it's almost scary! Except she's about ten years younger, paler, blonder and living on the east coast. Ah well. Nothing's perfect....     In other news, I'm meeting up with my  hottie teacher  this eve to discuss "where I'd like to go" with this whole  doctoral program  thing... I know where I'd  "like to go" ...Heh Heh! [{gasp} who said that??! Who has been sneaking in here and typing on my keyboard??! Shocked! I am, just  shocked ! Eh hem...] but I'm not super sure she's  that  kind of  teacher ![ again  with the filth??!! I order you to cease and desist at once,  Sir , or I shall have no other recourse but to seek  legal action ...!] Ah, well. I'll stick with the adoring grad student thing and see how far  that  gets me... At least I get to see her on a regular basis. That's better than some of my relationships!     Big shout out to  Sir J  for his assistance in my efforts to secure a breadmaker! You are brillant! That's it, just brillant!     I miss  Pretty Boy . I not actually going to  call  him or anything because he's a  very  busy person and I'm acting like I understand that and am fine with it and more than occupied myself.... Still though.    {sigh}   I'm also attempting to weane myself off  coffee  and it's proving  difficult  not so much in the "head-achey" physical way but more in a cranky,  sad for no reason  way. Although, I'm also expecting a  visit from Auntie Flo   sometime this week so the ole  hormonal variance  may have something to do with the  moodiness  as well. And on that note, isn't it  GREAT  that you, my  public  get  all  the intimate details vis a vis my cycle yet I'm unremittingly close-lipped about the details regarding  actual traffic  in and  around that miraculous self-cleaning organ?  (not that I trust the whole "self-cleaning" propaganda to the point where I won't give it a good swab every now and again but I do remember reading someting about leaving it to its own devices and it maintaining a fairly pristine set of working conditions all by itself -- although that particular brochure may have been about the "inner ear". i don't really know anymore...) Anyway, my point being: you all get stuck with the  biology  and none of the  chemistry  and damn it, I feel for you....!  I was talking to  Tony  the other day and we were discussing some boy and in trying to describe the sheer amounts of baggage he came equipped with I said: "Let's just say he's going to take awhile going through customs!" Which made us both  fall over laughing  and which (since I give you nothing else) i thought I'd share with you all today. "Look!" I hear you saying en masse, " Chick  is sometimes witty in real life! Let's keep reading in the hopes it translates to her writing...!" {again, with the sigh} I am in such a wierd mood....

       Comments   Alrighty then, how's everyone doing? Good? Good. It has recently been suggested that the " comments " area of this blog is insufficient in that it is too damn tiny and "that nobody reads it anyway." Now, I for one,  love  the comments section primarily because when a  loyal reader  does deign to  actually type something in , it's usually pretty funny (what can I say, it would appear that I am surrounded by people who are  witty to a freaking fault !) thing is, not alot of people seem inclined to use the  comments functionality  more than sporatically. NOT that this is a problem. I'm all about the rambling  on  and  on  and  on  until someone calls the  cops ... What I  would  like to know though is  IF  I were to figure out a way to make the comments slighty  more accessible  to the  general reading population  (a task which may or may not involve a move to a whole other  blogging system ) would any of you be more likely to  leave your thoughts ? Conversely, if I left it the way it is but took it upon myself to  periodically post  those insights that, in my humble opinion, were particualrly apt/made me  fall out of my chair  would that suffice? Furthermore, do we think it would be my  moral obligation  to  notify  the individual  before  making their comment  more  public or is the fact that they  left it in the first place  enough to get me out of any  potential legal situations  vis a vis making those thoughts a bit more apparent...? My  initial impulse  here is to establish a "comments" area where I can copy and post any  related notes  that strike my particular fancy while still leaving the full comments section for persons to explore should I forget/not have time to regularly go back and edit past postings.... What do we think?     K. Next. A super big shout to my splendid ex-co-worker buddy  SAH  who is currently frolicing in the sunny, bohemian climes of  urlLink  Ann Arbor, MI  , who checked in this morning to say that all is well and who I miss terribly! This whole "you-working-somewhere-else" thing? I  don't think that was such a good an idea after all.... So, you be coming back, when??  Actually, along those lines I wandered in this morning  completely sad  that I haven't had a chance to check in with my  boyz  who are actually located right around the freaking corner! (Damn  new job responsibilities ! Damn  school !) Luckily the always adorable  Tony  stopped by to remind me of my priorities and I was able to squeeze in a visit with not only his fine self but with my super-favorite  Sir J  as well!   Sheesh. I've got a freaking lot going on right now. It's nice that everything seems to be falling into place but still....     School. Love school. Still hot for  teacher . After class on Tuesdee,  Prof. K.  suggested we get together to discuss "what I wanted to get out of her class" to see if she could "help me with anything" eh, hem... The aforementioned  tete a tete  happened yesterday and will  happen some more   on  Monday  since I was late ( dur! ) and she didn't feel like we had enough time to  really get into  the various ideas she had for "helping me advance"...! Sigh. I heart her. My  Wed. class  went well as well.  Berk. Teacher  is a bit scattered but fellow  students  are cute/smart seeming and I like roaming around the campus -- although I am SOOOOO taking  BART  from now on. It costs in the nieghborhood of  12.00 - 15.00  to park over there for one freaking 3 hour class!! Bastards! Anyway... I had a  ton  of reading to do and  two little papers  to write which I actually did so I feel pretty on top of my game (right this second. Check back with me in a week and I guarantee you, I'll be flailing...!) One of our readings for the class was/is  urlLink  Bone Black   by  bell hooks  and I have got to say, it didn't really strike me the way I thought it would. I mean,  urlLink this  is pretty indicative of the type of review I associate with this particular memoir and I was really very excited to read it but, I dunno, it just didn't stike me as all that brillant. I mean, maybe I'm not  aware  enough of the time/space/issues that she's writing about to understand how powerful her living through them was but on some level, I guess I expect a writer to anticipate that.... To be perfectly honest, I responded to this book the same way I did to  urlLink  The Bluest Eye   -- I LOVE  Toni Morrison , I wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't get into the writing. I dunno. In a way I feel like a  bad feminist  or something but at the same time I have  no problem  getting completely into any of several (all) of  Milan Kundera's  books not because I know any more about  communism in Prague  than I do about the  South during the early part of the century , but with  Mr. Kundera  I don't  HAVE  to know anything about the locale. The way that man puts words together to describe feelings/impressions is  nothing short of genius  and it never occurs to me to wonder if perhaps someone else might be getting more out of the text than I am....       In other news,  Big Brother  is driving out tonight from New Mexico for a little visit and to participate in a  urlLink triathlon .  I, for one, am  thrilled  that he's coming out onna counta I heart him very much. I'm a teeny bit confused however as to how exactly one  watches  a triathlon -- given the various wide-ranging components...? Ah, well, I'm sure it will all become clear in by  Sundee . Also arriving via plane will be the luverly  Missus Bro  and the  Squirt  whom I will be squiring about all day on Sat. Yay! I am fairly positive that much fun will be had by all.     Last and certainly least, here's some  urlLink political   urlLink crap  you'all might be interested in....    *                                                 *                                           *                                                 *    sick of writing documents wrote: comments??? How about full on discussion board!! Time to post some inflammatory stuff and have at 'er. People should leave their names, or be an "anonymous coward", much like slashdot. Time to start some word wars...    Chick wrote: Ha! and here's me thinking I've been inflammatory all along...!    a loyal hockey fan wrote: I'm loving the comments section. Are they moderated, or do they go straight to production with no usability review? If not moderated, I'd basically be free to vandalize with whatever propaganda I see fit. Anyway, in terms of the Bush recall effort, those people approached me at a peace rally in February. It bothered me at the time because I think even poor decisions must be suffered through. I've watched many (failed) recall efforts come and go in my home province of BC. They're the same every time, big press release, big news, gether some signatures, less press, it dies off and fails to attract enough attention before the deadline. We all shake our heads and wonder why we suffered through it. The Davis recall appears to be a different story. It looks like it's really going to work. Scary stuff.

       In a nutshell...   Long weekend  was  Fab ! Hope everyone out there had as GRAND a time as I did!! I'm currently moving into "the new space" here at work so I'll not  linger  long here in  blog-land , just wanted to give a shout-out or two to the folks who  enriched my life  this  week-end .  First and foremost would be the  Fabulous Miz B's ! Thanks fer the loverly invite to the  postponed-but-still-o-so-happening legalization  of your family unit! It was  very grand  hanging with ya'all, not to mention a  delight  seeing the various  babies  basically marching out the door on their way to  college !   Next we have a very  awfully warm squeeze  for the  front  urlLink neighbors   who were soooo very gracious to my wandering  Boo  after she  got tired  of me and decided she really wanted to visit with some  other  adults. I am  well aware  that an  unexpected visitor  (regardless how  freaking adorable  she may be)  is, oftimes a bit much so I'm super-modo thankful that you guys not only  took her in  but even went so far as to  teach her a skill ! (That poker playing is going to come in handy the next time we get to  Reno !)   Let's see, then we have  Mr. R-B Guy  who not only allowed me to  invade his domicile  on  Sundee  but who also made the fifteen hour drive out to  Oak-town  on Mondee to assist in some  serious planning  for the  loft re-assignment surgery . I am  always delighted  to find that my friends are so  completely  talented and this was yet another example of how  gloriously lucky  I truly am!   Other minor  players  in the week-end but  no less important  were the fabulous  Miss Tail  with whom we dropped off a  couch  and then proceeded to breakfast with and  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  who supplied the aforementioned  couch .  Awfully good  to see both of you! I really don't get to hang with either of you nearly as much as I probably should (really!) but my goodness, when I do squeeze in the random visit I am simply struck by the quality-personess of both of you. Really, you're just phenomenal!   Whew! I think that's mostly it. If I forgot anyone, please know it's because I'm all flustered and trying to figure out why my keyboard is soooo freaking  high  at this new station and not because you who were not instrumental in my happiness. Kisses all round! Mwah, mwah!! More later if time permits......

       Kids today!  So, last night, I'm at home, making some   sup sup  , washing a  dish  or two and I hear the  kid  in her room playing "school". I peek in and she's got some  animals  lined up and she's explaining some  concept  to them but the  big floppy rabbit  isn't interested so  "Miss Honey"  has to get  authoritative  on his furry little butt and explains to him (in a pretty stern voice) that if she can't get some   attentive listening   pronto  Mr. Bun  is going to be warming the bench for the first five minutes of recess! Now this is scary even to me so, of course,  Bunny-Boy  straightens up and the lesson continues. Now the  reason  I bring this up -- the reason I select this  particular instance  of my kid's adorability to relate is because the  lesson  for the day is on "interrelated concepts". "This is a  Ven diagram " announces my  six-year-old  kid drawing some circles overlapping each other.... My  professor  drew a "ven" (sp) diagram in class the other night and  hand-to-god  that was probably the  first  time I've  heard the term . Sheesh! Seriously, if that kid was tall enough to reach the  Cheerios  my continued existence in her life would be  completely  obsolete!     Thanks to our  Travelin' man  for the primo suggestions re: small circular tins! {rubs hands together} This is all coming together soooo nicely!    K. hat's it for now, I'm sneaking out early to try to get my  Trick  on so   Happy Happy Hallows   to everyone! hope everyone has as much fun as it's possible to have without getting killed or evicted!

       I need a circular tin...  And no, that's not  code  for anything. I really do need a smallish circular shallow container preferably divided into "pie-shaped" sections (in fact I need  four  of them) so if anyone out there has any leads re: this, please to let the  Chick  know. Thanks!  In other news, my  Beautiful Prof  had her wallet lifted yesterday which SUCKS so everyone is required to  think good, supportive thoughts  for her in order to  persuade the universe  to further assist in the "setting right" of this stupid and annoying situation with as little effort/pain as possible. Thanks again!  K. So, someone rings my doorbell at  5:36  this morning. Just a single ring. I assumed it was my  BB-Q  coming for a little visit (Ha! not really, she had just mentioned that she might be stopping by to  steal my truck  and I ash-humed that was code for "Just wanted you to know, I'm taking your truck but I don't want to wake you up") but  then  I got a phone mee-suage from the lady in question stating that she was NOT using the vehicle today which leaves us with the somewhat disconcerting fact that  someone rang my doorbell  (politely) at  5:36  in the freaking morning! (For those of you familiar with the housing layout you will realize that you have to actually  go looking  for my doorbell, it's not like it's just out there on the street for some random passer-by to toy with...) Anyway. Weird.  You know, I think, I'll actually leave on that note. I have a  group paper  due today that I must print and bind and whatnot so I'm off off off to the land of the eed-u-ka-tid! Hope the world is splendid for everyone today!

       Fascinating!  Well hello there! I am in a FABULOUS mood today (not sure  why  since i've been having to  WORK  all morning -- Bastards!!) at any rate, I had a  very  productive  date/advisory session  last night with the Ever-Hot  Prof K  and she gave me an idea for a project that while being  stellar  in and of itself led me this morning to an even  BETTER  idea that is just so   fabulous   I don't even think I can stand it! Really. I don't. I'm not going to say  what it is  or anything onna counta it's  highly marketable  and " the man " has spies everywhere but should I actually do it I'm sure most of you will be forced to make much of it so don't go feeling  left out of the loop  or anything. The Fabulous and Effervescent  Miss Bee  just sent some pics of her bubs (aka  children  you perverts!) and THEY ARE ADORABLE!! Now,  both  of the  Ms. B's  are pretty  easy on the eyes  but I still swear I do not know who they paid to get a  license to produce  such phenomenally  attractive childruns  but there you go. Life=wacky sometimes. {sigh} K. really just checking in. I have to get back on track with my  production duties  or else I will be   skewered   at the end of this week.  Ta fer now.... Drop us a line if you get a chance!

       Ugh.  Here it is my  favorite day  after my   favorite  day  of the year (we  get  an hour, yeah. Baby!!) and I'm still tired. Granted i have NO leg to stand on viv a vis  why  I'm tired (and  achey  and the tiniest bit  hung over ) since I had a  great  week-end, but still... I'm  exhausted  right this second.  Shout out to  Pretty Boy , thanks for treating me to one of the  most expensive  plates of  pasta  I think I've ever eaten, and thanks for taking it completely in stride when I inadvertantly ordered a  bottle  of the  Chateau Syrah '97 instead of a  glass  (  Loser  =me!) You're one class act, my friend and you just get more and more adorable!  Didn't mention it on Friday but I had my  butter-Boo  here with me at work for part of the day and she was just GREAT! She sat in on some very boring, very long, very  confined  meetings and was a   trooper   throughout! Yay,  Boo , we wuv!  Also big shout out to the fabulous  Miss Tail  who is carrying more than  her fair share  of the  flirtatious duties  (see  Chick's   bonehead interaction  with  cute girl  below). I have always felt that the world  needs more flirting  and I am delighted you have managed to so completely  carry the team  this week-end! I, myself, have thought long and hard about what my damn deal is and have, as of yet, come up with  nothing  so you may be playing all the positions for the next little bit.   TIA  , you rule!

       I am an idiot.   Cute  Boo  Teacher comes up after class today. Smiles warmly, extends her hand and says: "I just wanted to officially introduce myself. I'm  C ." I, being just as suave as it's possible for a  single human being  to be reply: "Oh. Uh. yeah. Hi. I knew that." I  knew  that??! What am I in "How to effectively curtail a conversation 101"??? And,   no  , in answer to those of you who are probably saying, "well, after that, you  rallied  right? You came back with something.  Anything ... right???!" Nope. I sat there. Another  parent  stepped into the  void  and commenced with an actual   conversation  .  Boo , herself stepped up and remarked that she "liked class today!" I mumbled something relatively incoherent, acted like it was some kind of freaking  chore  to gather together the assorted clothing of two  six year olds  and left. Gawd! Sometimes i am so unbelievably lame I amaze myself!     Miss Boo  is having a  playdate  right now with a child whom she  cannot stand . It's weird. This kid torments her pretty constantly at school but at the same time sometimes she's incredibly nice to her so our  Boo  is  conflicted . She was pretty excited about the IDEA of this kid coming over but the reality of the situation is that i have two kids in my house who insist on fighting about EVERY SINGLE THING the other says. Cute though because they also want to have the exact same stuffed animals, dinner plates and drinks as each other. Ah,  youth ! Anyways, they're getting along right this second (in a bossy, cranky kind of way) so I've been reduced to "figurehead" status. I feel a little like  King Solomon : "So, then you said what? And then what did  you  say? And what about that hurt your feelings? So. what do we need to do to fix it? K! So, let's do that then!" Hee Hee. Kids are weird -- not like us  adults  who are really  easy  to figure out...!

       The king is dead! Long live the King   Or rather the  President . Today  i  am the  President  because my kid put a  stars and stripes sticker  on my hand and  informed  me that I was. So, my  first line of business , I'm thinking is a nice long  nappy-nap  in the  Lincoln Bedroom . After that I'll see about  balancing the budget , making education  our number one priority  and getting the troops the  HELL  out of  Iraq .   Speaking of which (the Presidential sticker, not the troops -- besides which, was anyone else surprised by the fact that a "troop" is a single person...? For the vast majority of my life I thought "troop" was plural like a "Boyscout troop" which is composed of many children, anyway...) I'm wearing this  stars and stripes sticker  on the train today and I notice a "radical type" glance at it then at me and I actually felt uncomfortable. Like I should  take it off  so people don't get the "wrong" impression that being that I  agree with  or  support  anything currently going on in this fine country of ours but then I thought "Hey! It's  my  country too, dammit!" So I've decided to take the path currently being blazed by our own  Elephant Princess  and join in the fight to   "Take back the Flag!"   Who's with me (!!), show of hands...!

       Things I do NOT wish to be reminded of...  I know I said I'd put out for  Lyle  tickets but that was a joke! (Well, not entirely but I said it after the  original  offer was made so it's not like it was part of the contract...!) and These children having designs on me is NOTHING like me having designs on my  professor ! They are  young  and experiencing   minor infatuation   with someone who they consider to be their "superior" yet at the same time "accessible" and the power differential inherent in that situation turns them on. I, on the other hand, am in  love . (Or at least pretty seriously in like. Besides, my  Prof  is cute!)

       Mrs. Robinson meets the WonderTwins!  What if you were friends with somebody who showed up in your life somewhat randomly but then proceeded to sort of entrench themself by calling your house, inviting you over for movie nights at their house, just sort of dropping by at odd hours.... What if they one day gave you a ticket to see the  urlLink world's best musician  claiming that they wanted "nothing in return" just thought you "might like it". What if they then dropped by your house one night bearing a box of  urlLink chocolates  and a six-pack of  urlLink beer  stating that they were "in the neighborhood". What if during the course of the evening they tried to intice you into playing "Truth or Dare".... You'd think they were fishing for a  one-way ticket into your pants  now wouldn't you?? What if they were a "them"?? Seriously, I do not know what is up with kids today but I think a coupla friends of mine might have a   crush   on me. Together. The TWO of them. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all about the  togetherness  vibe and if I was going to make the  sweet love  to a  group , you two would definitely be at the top of my list but sadly, methinks the  wrong tree  is being proverbially barked up. You see I am OLD. We old people have had a chance to look around a little, try a few things, kiss a pretty wench or two and the thing we've come to value most highly mongst all the things we've seen and done is  sleep . That thing last night where I  got all cranky  cause you guys wouldn't leave and it was inching past 10:00? That was for real. I ate your  chocolates , I drank your  beer , I laughed as your told me your interesting  stories  and make  pretty little faces , I even felt a tiny  flush  when you decided it was "too hot' in the house and started taking your  clothes  off. And, at 10:00, all these things notwithstanding, I wanted you  gone . Understand? I do NOT have the energy anymore to engage in crap like that. Please do not take it personally but at the same time, if I  am  on the mark in any respect re: this whole plan to   get-you-some-Chickster   please remove me from your list of possibilities. I am flattered (You're both very sweet and I'd probably do you separately) but I really cannot  even  begin to get into why the whole thing is such a very bad idea. Just trust me on this.

      There was this guy on campus today  paying a whole lot of attention  to a plot of  grass  near where I was sitting this morning having my  bagel  and  tea  and doing a little  light reading  vis a vis -  "Cultural critism and hegemonic discourse as it pertains to the pathologizing of an ethnic subset..."  And by attention, I mean  Serious  attention. I mean, let's say you're braiding someone's hair, someone that you like so you're being super careful and not pulling or anything but at the same time you want to do a good job, be  thorough  about it and all that, so you're sort of  slipping your fingers  through their hair delicately but with some  authority  as you divide the various strands and smooth out the lengths for braiding; this guy was doing that, running his fingers through the grass but not in any kind of  off-hand  way -- with authority! He even pulled out an  implement  at one point and used it to slash at some offending bits but in a  business-like way , not like he was  mad  at the grass, more like he was  pruning , which I might have thought he was doing if he hadn't stayed crouched over the same  foot by foot plot  for well over half an hour. I mean, this is   Berkeley   and there's one hell of alot of grass and if he was the  official gardener  I can't imagine he would have been able to keep the entire place as tended as it obviously was by spending that much time and energy on one little tract. I mean, they  re-seeded  an area up by my class a few weeks ago then when the shoots didn't appear  immediately , they just ripped it up and planted some of that "roll-out" grass stuff over it. Not a patient bunch,  Berkley lawn-care peeps . Plus, this guy had bluish hair. I'm seriously doubting that   Cal   would employ a blue-haired, Hawaiian shirt wearing skater guy to "represent" as it were, regardless of how much he liked grass. Anyway, I watched him for a really long time as he finished "pruning", stuck a metal stake into the ground, counted off the steps to the stake from the nearest tree then packed up his implements and sauntered off. I went over to look at the bit where he had been standing but it just looked like grass to me. I gave it a pat anyway just cause, then went to class.       Speaking of class, have I mentioned how much I'm enjoying school? It's strange how much my classes are feeding each other. I mean we were talking about "inclusion" last night then today we're discussing giving kid's "voice" and some sense of political agency and now I've got all these other ideas for my "design an inclusive school" assignment... It's just weird is all. Nice weird but weird.  I'm going to start referring to everything as a potential "chapter" of my dissertation. It makes everything sound so much more  directed . Like, oh sure, it may look as if I'm just hanging out with a bunch of kids who don't want to be in school but when you frame it as "fieldwork" that you're engaged in in an effort to measure youth autonomy as it supports attempts to secure a more authentic "agency" well, dammit, it just looks better on the grant proposals is all I'm sayin'....

       I think my soul is old  I'm sitting here staring at a  urlLink West Elm  catalog and I'm thinking I have a theory about  those people  who like having one stick of  brushed steel furniture  with a  single oversized book  of prints made during  Picasso 's blue period lying  slightly askew  atop it as their  sole living room decoration . I'm thinking maybe they're  new . Like maybe their souls are  fresh  and  new  and just got here and haven't really had a chance  to look around  and become attached to all the  diverse trappings  of a life well lived. Maybe they feel better with the  one or two items  much like some very  small children  become attached to a single "fluffy" and that's all they need. I'm thinking the same thing about people who like their things all  shiny  and  new  and  pressed . I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it I just think it's interesting that  new things make me nervous  while they make other people  feel more secure . My  Baby Brother   loves  new things.  CP  makes an honest attempt to keep anything she purchases as fresh  as the day she removed the shrink wrap . Me, I look for things with stains. I just got a new pair of shoes upon which I just noticed the first  scuff . I am thrilled! Anyways... just thinking about stuff before I go to class and have to think about other stuff. Cheers and all that. Hope everyone has a spectacular day....!

      Know what's  hot ? Sitting in your  Hottie Professor's  chair trying to arrange a  booty call  using her office phone. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't  intend  to be sitting in her chair whilst  setting up the nasty , I  intended  to call my buddy  Pretty Boy  to just check in, see how his life was going and then I thought "Hey, maybe I'll just  go over  and see how he is  in person " and  then  I thought "but if I drive  all the way home  the  second  i get in the door I am  not  going to want to leave, so perhaps I will call him from here [being  urlLink school ]" then I thought "but  where  is there a  phone  on which to make this call" and I looked up and my  uber sweetheart teacher  was unlocking her door and I thought "hmmmm, perhaps she will let me use her phone to make this call" so I asked and she said yes and then I got in her  office  and I was so delighted suddenly that I was "in her space" that I  HAD  to stare at her stuff -- besides, she went out in the hall for some reason (SEE,   tact  ! Yet another  sterling quality  for me to make much of!!) and it was easier to stare while  sitting  and then HE answered and he sounded sooooo unbelievably  cute  and  unavailable  and everything that drives me crazy about him that by the time I REALIZED I was drooling all over my  oh-so-patient-prof's  phone... well, let's just say that while the  normal  part of my brain registered "mortified" the  other  part of my brain, the part that really just isn't consulting the  list of reasons  that  Best Buddy Q  so helpfully compiled re:  other  career limiting moves I could engage in instead of trying to sleep with my Professors (not really. I have accepted that  that sort of intimacy  probably just isn't in the cards but still, a gal's entitled to completely deny reality, right??)  that  part took a  long cool look  at the situation and registered "Hot!" Anyway. I'm weird and wired and my boy is scheduled to  begin  driving home from  Mountain View  in about  three hours  so, no nookie-nookie for me. P'raps I will eat lots of chocolate chip cookies instead. Yes. That sounds like a plan.

      I'm sure this is interesting to  noone  (at least no one who still  reads this thing ) but me but in investigating my pockets, I discovered a locket that  Boo  had given me to hold for her at some point this week-end. I opened it up and further discovered that she had found, cut out and managed to glue a tiny picture of the Ex's son into the inside of it. Not sure what more to say (or even what I think) about it but I just thought it was interesting that she wanted his picture to be in her keepsake.

       Genius!   Kid  had a starring part in a  skit  this morning at school where she exercised her " right to pass " ( Tribes  thing, you wouldn't understand) and she was  brillant ! Just  stellar ! Good job, kid! You rock!    I was in such a very pissed off mood yesterday that I completely forgot to give major props to my Sweet little  Angel  who has managed to entice his  Texan  back to our fair state for an  extended visit ! Good show, Hon'! I have  GOT  to know though, does he  always  leave his  boots  on...?     Also big shout out to all the  beautiful boys  in my life who were  so nice to me  yesterday when all the big bosses decided to  FREAK RIGHT OUT ! You guys are the  best ! No,  Really ...!

      Blah! Work  sucks  today! My various  bosses  are all  freaked out  over some  HUGE  scheduling thing that i did (with their  approval  I might add!) that apparently  threatens the fate of the free world  or something equally heinous...   Anyway, just to give a little overview of the new rant structure vis a vis the " key players ":   Boss #1, 2 & 3  have been  dissolved  as  functional entities . Instead we now have " Head Honcho " being my direct supervisor here at   Sniff  , " Tampa Teddy " being the guy in charge of the   GlobalGroup   troops (coincindentally also being the one making my life especially difficult right now FOR NO REASON!!!), " El Torito " (aka Boss #2 ) being my "team lead" and primary contact with   Leech-Land   and finally  Todd . Boss extraordinaire, head and CEO of   Leech-Land  . For those of you keeping track,  Boss #3  is no longer my boss but remains  my bud  so we've come up with a shiny new monniker just for him --  Elephant Princess  (Not "elephant" meaning in any way to imply that he's  heftier  than most but "elephant" as in "the elephant in the room noone is talking about" and "princess" just cause... well,  if you know him you'll see why this just sooooo right) ... K. are we all up to date. everyone set? Good.      Tampa Teddy , you   SUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK  ! {breathe out} There. I feel much better now.

       what does desperation smell like?  K. so I cannot stop going to   urlLink travel sites   and checking on " vacation sales ." I came  THIS  close to booking a flight to   Georgia   because it was cheaper than  Albuquerque  (where I actually  have  family)... I was in the elevator this morning and some chick was talking about  Washington DC  and I started thinking "Hmmmmm.  DC ... What is there to do in  DC ? We could go to the  Mint !" The  Mint . I ask you...! {sigh} I am soooo needing to just freaking GO somewhere! But where? And with what? Contrary to all appearances I'm not exactly rolling in the cash right now... Anyways, if anyone knows someplace good and cheap (or expensive to get to but with appropriate "ins" -- re: someone me and the  Boo  could stay with for a coupla days) let me know ASAP otherwise I'm afraid I'm just going to book the next  non-refundable fare  I see and wind up in  Salt Lake City  standing in line to see the Osmond's birthplace!! (Not, that there's anything wrong with that....)    So, you know what's fun? Sit down with a  six year old  (it's more fun if it's  your   six year old  but if you are not so  blessed  feel free to borrow one from the  neighbors ) and flip through a fashion  urlLink magazine . Flip through fairly fast, page by page and let the kid tell you what/who  appeals to them  and what doesn't. Every so often see if you can get them to tell you what it is exactly that they don't like about the " nahs ". I  guarantee  you will gain an  incredible amount of insight  into the  human psyche . Plus, it's  fun . I, myself learned that "furry bags are  weird ", that there is such a thing as "too much gold", and that  even a six year old  can tell when a lady is "way too skinny!"

       Too much information  Today, standing on the  train  ( not  the good-smelling one) lodged between  a pole  and  two female persons  of the   Cole Valley  variety  I learned the following:    Patty  is  only  43 and has already started  menopause    Jill  and  Frank  are celebrating their  5th anniversary  but with the   baby   it's probably going to be a  stay-at home  thing   Karen  thinks that's a shame and will  take the baby  but probably can't take  Melissa  since she's already  got the girls  and they're having a  slumber party , but on second thought, maybe  Melissa  can come if  Jill  thinks she won't be bored   Jill  thinks she won't be bored but  Karen   knows   Frank  and he's not going to want to do anything anyway   Karen  thinks maybe a  BB-Q  after the  kid's game  might be fun   Jill  is astonished to learn that the  kid's game  will  only last 30 minutes    Karen  assures her that it's because it's  T-ball  then suggests that perhaps they should just  take off  [I'm assuming the two of them] and "celebrate" on their own [not super sure how it ended up being "thier"  anniversary  but maybe i'm missing some "used-to-be-together"  lesbo  vibe...]     Jill  thinks this is a grand idea and wants to go to  Sonoma  [ Sonoma??! ]   Karen  thinks maybe  Marin  or  Sausalito  but remembers she can't because the  sonogram is on Tuesday  [sooo, not sure how this information is pertinent but again, p'raps I'm missing something]   Karen's  mom and her grandmother all started menopause  at the age of 43    and , we're back to  Patty ...!  k. so. Do I need to meet these people at a dinner party? I think not. I feel like we went to high school together fer chrissakes. That  Frank  guy, though, needs to catch a  fast clue  cause hand-to-god if he  doesn't  step up quick, before he can put 6 and 9 together, his little lady's gonna take  Missy  and the  Bub  and set up some housekeeping with "her good friend, and sometimes f***buddy",  Karen .     now then, where were we...? Ah, yes, being  sunny and light  about the world. Last night the  Boo  opened a present she'd just received from her  Great Gramma  and ta-da! A copy of   Doctor Doolittle   that was given to my Gramma in  1924  by her teacher! Yay!  Gramma  also enclosed some of the notes we've (me and my brothers) written her during our time on the planet together. Consider an exerpt written by a thirteen year old  Chick  about a pillow:   Hello G-ma, How are you? I am fine. Things here are going well. Did you get the pillow I made you? I made one for my mom too that says 'Kiss the cook'   [Kiss the cook?? on a pillow? I ask you...!]    she says she likes it   [bless her sweet heart! I wonder if she still has it? I should ask - hee hee]   and that it was just the thing she needed.   [??!]   Anyway, I'm going to go now. I love you and hope you and G-pa are doing o.k. out in all that snow!   [Har Har! Get it?? They live in North Dakota! Snow!! eh, hem...]   Bye for now. Kiss the cat for me!   [I have no idea.... -ed]"   Yay! we heart  Gramma/Great Gramma !!      Big shout out to my  Best buddy Q  who is sick and dying. Sorry Sweetie, hope you feel better soon. Let me know if I can do anything to help....

       Viva la gender-bender types!  I heart people who do the gender cusp thing! I mean  really  heart them, like to the point of just admitting i have a  freaking  fetish   about it!   Yesterday after class I went to see a  gallery show  about  boys who dress like girls  -- the show consisted of a series of  tryptichs  showing "before", "in process" and "after" shots and while I have to say some of the  before  and  afters  were pretty interesting onna counta the remarkable (or lack of remarkable)  change in demeanor , the   "process"   shots were amazing...!! My goodness! How beautiful is it to see a black and white, 3/4 shot of a  bee-u-ti-ful  boy curled over a tiny mirror, flourishing a  mascara wand ! Who knew the image of an otherwise extremely "straight-looking" beer commercial kind of guy, leaning in a doorway and grinning as he pulls on a pair of spangly fishnet stockings could be so damn sexy! And don't even get me started on the various "full make-up but otherwise nude" pics (!!)  "Compelling"  does not  even  begin to cover it. i swear there's gotta be some sort of club for  gals like me  who really just want to watch boys getting decked out in the sequins and heels. And let's not forget the  ladies ! This particular show was  boy specific  but I feel compelled to give the love to the  short-haired chickie  slipping into the crisp, cotton button-down shirt as she readies herself for a night out.... mmmmmmmmmmm.....  Anyway. Good show.    In other news i have THE world's largest, grossest, most imflamed, infected looking, not too mention ITCHY  cold sore   ever  to appear on the planet we like to call earth right now on my  bottom lip .  Line forms to the right  people, step right up, viewing starts at nine! Now then, much as I would LOVE to blame  DB  and his insidious little germ-age for this breakout, I  cannot  since he's been  officially shackled  for the last little bit. I  was  going to go for the "stress" card but that would imply that I've been  working  which could not only be  easily disproven  it might also send some of my  readers  into severe giggle attacks and let's face it, they're not the  strongest  bunch to begin with -- so that leaves us only with FATE. i have a  paper  due on  Wed . and  Sunday  is really the only time I'm going to have to concentrate on it so  my body  (knowing that I was  actually  considering spending the day  at the  urlLink movies   or in the backseat of someone's  urlLink car ) has decided to step in and make it so I have to stay home and type. {sigh} So nice to know  someone  is thinking about this stuff. I'd  hate  to have my life left  completely  up to me!

       She wasn't good...  but she had good intentions!  Lyle =Great. Great performer, great singer, great songwriter. Although, I may not go to his shows anymore (KIDDING!) onna counta the  company  I'm being forced to keep whilst in attendance is beginning to get to me. Seriously people, am I the only freaking  non-white ,  non-upper middle class ,  non-early-to-late forties  chick (who wasn't brought by her parents)  in the world  who loves me some  Lyle ? And the overall  vibe ; the whole "Let's call him by his first name (e.g. {shouted out mid-performance} "We love you,  Lyle !") Let's act like we  really  know the man, let's pretend we [all  three hundred  of us] are his close, personal friends and should be allowed to suggest what he plays next!"  vibe  kills me! Sheesh. I kept wanting to just cringe away whenever anyone started with the  calling out . I want a  pin  that says "loving Lyle in a  healthy  way..." {sigh} ah well. c'est la vie.   I  do  gotta say that there were considerably more  peeps of color  at this particular show than were at the last one. I was a teensy bit worried because  Mr. Lovett  did not choose to bring his  back-up singers  to this gig meaning that  the ranks  were  potentially diminished  five-fold... Luckily, he enlisted the aid of a local  gospel choir  who were apparently each allowed to bring  two  guests -- I'm just assuming, since I ended up counting  thirteen  brown people in the audience divided by the five brown types in the choir... Sorry. Just tired of standing out all the freaking time.... Still and all, show was great. Got home at midnight. Am currently exhausted.     A friend of mine is traveling around  New Zealand  and he wrote this in an e-mail:   "thinking of taking a train across the outback to  Perth ..."    Gawd! is that a beautiful concept or what??! I have  got  to get out of here and go do some serious traveling. I mean like NOW...  {sigh, again} still tired. must go work now....

       It's genetic!   Sorry, just had to check back to let everybody know that the ability to appreciate certain finer things in life are apparently  encoded in a person's DNA. Witness following conversation betwixt myself,  Boo  and  Cutie Programmer/Production Guy  here at work:   CPPG:  Well hello there!  Boo:  Hi.  Chick:  Hey. CPPG this is Boo.  CPPG:  Hello Boo.  Boo:  {still very cool} Hi.  CPPG smiles and walks away. As we continue down the hallway Boo looks up at me with a big ole smile and says   Boo:  Well, he's very handsome!   Chick:  He sure is! {Yay!}   uh, just so there's no  confusion  or anything,  SigTau  we were  not  referring to you, sorry....

       First off...  Let me just say this -- me.  Lyle . 8:00. tonight. {shhrrriiiiieeeekkkkkkkk!!!!!} Eh, hem. Now then...   Kid  is here with me today which is GREAT! How fun is it having your  Bub  with you at work??  Pretty damn  I'd have to say! We were  informed  that I was expected to come in today  despite the fact  that the persons I work directly with/under are  off   celebrating this glorious  divesting-of-the-Native-Peoples-from-their-land  Day. Whatever. I'm sneaking out early, F*** em if they can't take a ... er... absence? K. sorry, moving on...     Got a request from a  urlLink regular reader  for a "cooler nickname" which of course pre-supposes  a number of things  not the least of which being that one or more of the  other  names I have for people are cool/actually thought out. Still and all though, not willing to risk  fisticuffs  over this one (primarily because she  looks  easy going but trust me, she's  way  scrappy...!)  so after much thought I think I'm going to go with the " X-Factor ".   Reasons are as follows:   We have a weird relationship, me and her. We know each other. We like each other. She lives FIVE freaking giant steps away from me but still and all, i know almost nothing about her that wasn't told to me by her blog/her ex/our mutual buddy  SAH  so, given that she's my resident  woman of mystery , it seems pretty apt  I seem to recall she was a HUGE fan of the now defunct  X-files  and I'm sure she likes the  X-men  as well (I know, stretching, but we do what we can with what we are given...)  Even though she's seldom actually present in my life, it's eery how many times I end up at a gathering where she is in some way referenced. Weird, i tell ya!  So, there we have it!  X-Factor  ( X-Fact  has got a mate who'll I'll no doubt have to come up with something for as well but I've exhausted the creative- spark  assigned to this post so it'll have to wait....) Big shout out to  X-Factor , thanks for the impromtu watchage of my kid. I, myself, never get tired of the  Boo  but she sure does get tired of me. Thanks to both of you for being so accomodating!    Last and certainly never least (although I probably should have covered this BEFORE I used up my interesting vibe, ah well...) a big old THANK-YOU to  Mistah Lovah-Lovah ,  Miss K  and  Miss S  who were so very kind as to invite myself and the little one to celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving with them on Sat. eve! The food was  fabulous ! (And so pretty!!) Now, those of you  who know me  know I'm  THE  world's pickiest eater but I gots ta say, those gals served up some  tasty food ! Turkey, roast potatoes with garlic, mashed 'tates, yams -- Yum! No wonder  Mr. L-L  is getting so fat!   K. I'm outtie. Gonna pretend to work, now so I can justify getting  really pissy  tomorrow about how I had to come in to  WORK  today!

      This from  Other Girl :    So,  realistically , what's the maximum number of times you can fall truly, deeply in love? I think seven.... which would mean, I've used up all my turns so I should probably hope it's more like eight or nine. I don't really see how it could be though.    I, myself, would think it'd be alot less than seven but I hadn't really considered it as a finite occurence until a few minutes ago. I guess maybe  seven  is about right. I'm at  six  right now, not counting the kid...

       Sheesh...!  I was completely  blindsided  by the  parental units  at Boo's school today. Man, they were coming at me from all sides... "Is  Boo  going to be able to make it to  Shaleta's birthday party  tomorrow?", "Do you have your  giftwrap sales paperwork  with a check made out to...?", "Hi! We're  new  and our daughter  loves  your kid and we want to set up a playdate! [note: During this particular incursion, I also had  Boo  standing there giving me the "Um, mom, THAT'S the girl I was telling you about who I can NOT stand!!" look]  Chick : Um, yeah, sorry, we're not really  doing  playdates right this second because my schedule's just so... well, YOU know how it is...! [I gots my Baby's back!]", Can  Boo  come to  Randy's party  next Saturday?", "Can I talk to you about  the dance class our kids are in ...?", "Can I give you a ride to BART???" I mean, My Gawd, people!!! We are just a couple of tiny  problemsolvers  in a  vast world  of issues. Damn you, eerily passed on to our offspring unbelievably charismatic personality traits!!  (Ha! sorry. I just really wnted to see that last bit in writing.) O.k. I'm better now. Off to meet with the masses re: some work thing that I'm ill-prepared to address effectively (thank  GAWD  I've got the world's most  talented team of people  working with me, otherwise I'd be  ska-rewed !)      Oh, and I also wanted to say a great big Thanks! to my beautiful  Professor K.  for advocating on my behalf with the powers that be at the  urlLink school  and getting them to not only alow my petition for special study but also to waive the late fee usually associated with such random flights of nonsense. We wuv! K. off now. more later maybe. We'll just have to see...

       "The Asian sterotyping thing...  may not have worked for  Abercrombie & Fitch  but I'll bet  urlLink Ghetto-stereotypes  will work for   urlLink us  !!" - Bonehead Marketer    The  urlLink game's  inventor,  David Chang , 28, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan when he was 8, said: "They just have to remember this is just a game. This is a satirical look at stereotypes in America."  The game "is completely disgusting," said Franklin Stevenson, 40, a computer animator who heard about the demonstration on the radio and supported the protesters. "It speaks to the level of racism that still exists."  "It's like selling pictures of a lynching and people buying it like hot cakes," said Stevenson, shaking his head.  The controversy appears to be fueling the game's sales.  "For every bad e-mail ... I probably get like 20 orders," said Chang, who runs the operation out of his home in St. Marys, Pa.  Change said Urban Outfitters is the only retailer to carry the game in the Chicago area and sales clerks at their two stores in Chicago and one in Evanston said they have sold out of the game.  Calls for comment from Urban Outfitters corporate headquarters in Philadelphia were not returned Monday.  Chang, who said the game's inspiration came to him in fall 2001 while watching an episode of "MTV Cribs," a show that profiles the residences of famous rockers and rap stars.  Chang dismissed the criticism. Every race is denigrated in his game, he said.  "There's Asians, Irish, Italians, Jewish, any you can think of is on there. It's not just focused on the African-Americans," he said.  Chang said as an Asian-American he has had his own experiences dealing with negative stereotypes. To underline his point he said he has included in the game an exaggerated stereotype that assaults his own heritage.    Nice!  Anyway,   urlLink Worse Than Queer   has a (IMHO)  much  better argument for why the game and products like it purportedly intended as kitsch which utilize cariactures etc. should be more closely considered before we demand an instant recall --  not  that she's saying we  shouldn't  dismiss them, just that we should consider it a bit first...   I'm not suggesting that it's all just "play" as if people weren't deeply, psychically invested in these images/contests for meaning in different ways, or that we abandon representation as a site of political struggle because, hi, that's all I do, but that we get smarter about it, examine the circuits of power (who's "appropriating" from who? for what purpose? what exactly is being "borrowed"? etc.) and the ways in which resulting cultural productions are framed, exchanged, and potentially re-appropriated and/or deformed.     entire article is  urlLink here ...   Honestly, myself, I'm divided. My first thought was "Ha! I want it!" followed closely by the thought that I'd have no place to keep it since the  last thing  I'd ever want is for my  kid  to find it (or something like it) and think it has anything to do with reality, which in a twisted way it does... kind of... i guess... Anybody? thoughts??     New to the side links  urlLink Worse than Queer  insightful, rambling and more than a little pissed off. We like.

       First a moment of silence...  For the governor that once was:   {...................}   and a heartfelt vote of hopefulness that the new guy doesn't further screw everything up! You go, Guv! Good luck!  K. So, I'm kind of honestly thinking that given that a "record" number of  peeps  were motivated to  vote  and given the fact that having this  particular bozo  in as the requisite "republican" will alleviate the need to elect a more "politically oriented/conservative" one at some later date, I don't feel the need to complain all that much. I mean, we DO live in a  "democratic" society  and if the  vast majority  of people surrounding me  honestly think  this guy can do any better than the last one, well then so be it. At least people felt empowered to voice an opinion [however ill-informed and stunning in it's inability to see "the big picture" it may have been], and that's what we all wanted, right? Right?? Eh, hem...     In other news, THANK YOU,  Dirty Boy , my  sweetest , most  wonderful-est   boyfriend-for-life  (except not  really ... BUT I would have to say you are  extremely well positioned  to "get some" pretty much  on demand  from the  Chickster  for the  rest  of your natural life although, given that, it is too bad you've recently become " exclusive " with the ever cute  OG . Ah well, such are the vagarities of fate...) You are the  best  and I am honored and amazed that you saw fit to give   me   a  ticket  to see   urlLink Mr. Lyle Lovett   {shriekkkkk!!!!} in  concert  , in  Oakland , at the  Paramount !!!! My life is already full of  amazingly fabulous things  and the fact that you managed to pull this out of your...er...ah...  thin air , is nothing short of  frosting  on top of the  frosting  of the cake that is my life! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I owe you big time (take careful note, good readers, The ever-lovin'  Chick Magnet   will  put out for  Lyle Lovett  tickets!) Sigh... we heart....

       Sorry...  I was just thinking about this one time in  high school  when our  drama group  took a trip to some other school for a  state-wide drama competition  [not only did we  not  win, at one crucial point in the production  our stage set fell over ] and I got all  incensed  because shortly after we arrived, I glanced across the lobby and  some girl  was wearing  my-then-boyfriend's  pin! Let's just say,  much   off-stage drama  ensued during which our mutual friends went to  great lengths  to assure me that the  pin in question  had "just dropped off" and that this girl had picked it up and that  MTB  was simply following her around in an effort to get it back. I, of course, didn't believe a word of it and retaliated by  pseudo-hooking up  with  the-world's-sweetest-college-boy , who was trying to stage manage the entire production, find ushers for said event AND field the other rampant females who were trying to score invites back to his pad [I was actually in the room at one point listening to him fend off some other chick who wanted to come in and "look around" -- I don't blame em, kid was CUTE] anyways... long story short, at the time I didn't think it was at all possible that that  pin  just  happened  to fall off and that that chick just  happened  to pick it up. Now though, in retrospect, I can see how it might have happened that way. Sorry, I thought you were a lying sack of sh**,  MTB . My bad.

       Yawn!  Today I am home "sick" which is code for  SICK ! I am soooo dying right now. Not dying in the sense that I can't prop myself upright and make a feeble attempt at entertaining  you , my  public , but sick in the sense that my head hurts, I'm so tired I can't even figure out how to open the milk (true story), I'm slightly nauseous (probably due to lack of breakfast -- see aforementioned  situation  involving the fucking "child-proof" milk container!) and my joints ache. Now, I fully realize this is because I full-on over extended myself during the "7-day-birthday-extravaganza" that was last week but as it was all for a good cause (My beautiful  Boo 's birthday!) I am  mostly  prepared to suck it up and soldier on. [side note here, how freaking brillant is  Lyle Lovett ?? "My angel in distress/you look o.k. to me/ I'll send you my address/ when I know what it will be/ well I could easily stay with you/ on your side of heaven's door/ cause I don't love you any less/ but i can't love you anymore...."]    Now then. Quick week-end update:  Birthday bash  was fabulous! All the pretty people were there and much merriment was had by all. There was a bit of a time crunch at the end there since the way the party place worked was that the kids got an hour of running amok followed by  45 minutes  to eat pizza and cake and figure out the present situation. Cool  in theory  but in reality there's no freaking way seventeen kids are going to settle and eat and open lootbags and trade stuff and burst into tears for no reason in that short amount of time so although the troops made a valiant effort it still seemed a bit rushed toward the end. No worries though,  Mr. Lovah-Lovah  and the Fabulicious,  Ms. B   were good enough to get much of the hilarity on tape so I'm sure the only thing we'll remember three years from now will be the screaming.   So, last night i was sitting in a miserable about-to-get-really-sick heap on the porch and who (or rather  what ) should decide it's time to pay  Ms. Magnet  a visit? That's right, the friendly neighborhood   possum    who apparently  lives under my house . A  possum ! Now, don't get me wrong but I'm a desert kid; I know nothing of furry beings the size of small dogs with  long, rat-like tails  and  prehensile paws . In addition to hailing from the land of scaly creatures who run when you approach, I'm also a city-dweller. How the hell [excuse my french] does a freaking   possum   1) get into the city in the first place, 2) decide to live smack underneath a fairly busy residence [although not so much anymore since I've gone into semi-retirement] and 3) make friends with the resident pack of cats so there's no fighting over the kibble on the porch? Furthermore, what possesses aforementioned animal to suddenly decide that I am no threat whatsoever to his dinner activities?? A  possum !!!! What are we, in  alabama ??! Christ!

       It's all relative...  So some  lady  sitting in front of me on the bus today,  sneezed  and when I said "God, bless you!" She gave me  this  HUGE  smile . I was puzzling over this as the bus continued along on it's merry way until I saw she was holding a  yellow rosary  and apparently reciting her " Hail Mary's ". I guess it means more to have a stranger  save your soul  from the ernstwhile  urlLink clutches of evil spirits /eternal damnation if you're Catholic....     Gosh, I am soooo freaking busy right now! K. Sorry for the scarcity of witticisms. I've been forced into a position here that is uncomfortably close to  actual work  and I'm just not sure i'm o.k. with it! Birthday din-din last night was grand!  Kid  was a bit tired and as such was the tiniest bit cranky but in gen. all = good. The  Mondo B-day extravaganza  is slated for tomorrow and can I  JUST  say, I can hardly wait!!!! Sheesh, you'd think it was for  me   or something (Hee Hee, it soooo is! I'm just glad the  Kid  is o.k. with me vicariously  re-imaging my childhood  experience through her. I'm scared what'll happen when she's twelve and won't let me share her life anymore!! hmmmmmm. p'raps  bribery  is in order.... Or some sort of  blackmail . We shall see....) Anyways, really just stopped by to give the old heads up to my loyal fans re: my  lack of communication : It's not  you , I promise! It's   me  . I just can't  commit ...!

       Happy Birthday, Baby!  Happy happy birthday my precious, perfect repository of all that is  good  and  meaningful  about the world!!!! I love you,  Boo . You are the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee, the sunshine in my day! You, simply put,  rock  and I thank my lucky stars  daily  that you saw fit  to bless me with your presence! Enjoy being  six ! I hear it's a  very  good year....    And while we're at it, a big shout out to  Miss Bee  who also recently turned six (yesterday)! Congratulations! You're the coolest  mother of twins  I know (with the possible exception of your ernstwhile partner in crime, but hey, it's not  her  birthday now is it??!) You go, you adorable young thing! we wuv!

       Beauty and light...  But, having said all that, I also realize there are people out there trying to make their kid's lives work with  co-parents  who are complete   a**holes   and so, whilst I reserve the right to be occasionally annoyed, I do still feel very lucky that the worst of my problems seem to be minor disagreements over who gets to advise  Boo  on how to handle the bully at school rather than who forgot to pick up the kid because she was busy  smoking crack  with her new  strung out girlfriend ...    Right, moving on.  Boo  and I went to the see the  urlLink Degas sculptures  yesterday. She was in a sad mood (i think she's getting sick) and so was more interested in hanging out on the benches than in the sculptures themselves but still and all she was a big ole trooper! She did actually get pretty excited about some of the art in some of the other galleries but "excited" for a kid translates into  touching  and by the time the   third  adult person  had politely asked her to please stay off the exhibits she was pretty much done with art. She did let me carry her around to some of the  Victorian rooms  though and she even went so far as to murmur "pretty" when she noticed me transfixed in front of one my favorite " urlLink sad little milkmaid " paintings (speaking of which;  William-Adolphe Bouguereau  =   amazing   and what with  Christmas  coming up, if anyone feels like  buying a substantial bit  of my love feel free to consider  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink this  as worthy installments...!) Anyway, all in all long week-end was fine. I had a great time hanging wiht the kid and also had some very tasty ham and potates for  Thanksgiving  repast and me and the  CP  were mostly able to play nice so it's all good. Hopefully, I be able to finish the second of the thousand and six papers due this week, and then, maybe, possibly, get some actual sleep tonight! O.K. probably not but it's good to hope, right?

       Total Hate   Hullo folks, hope the Turkey day was all you wanted it to be and more! Today I officially hate this guy:   Noah's Bagels staffperson:  Can I help you?  Marin type guy in Outback Red Windslicker thing:  {holding two partially eaten bagel sandwiches} These are completely underdone. I've ordered these maybe thirty times and I know how they should taste and these aren't cooked right.  NBSP:  O.K. Let me take your order again...  MTGIOWST:  She didn't cook it right. You have to set the right time on the microwave and really watch it  NBSP:  Two...?  MTGIOWST:  EggMitts with  Egg Beaters , Cheddar Cheese, pepper and chives ONLY, toasted on an everything bagel  NBSP:  Yes, Sir. We'll make them right away. {turns to give order to other staff person who has been there at least six years - I know this because I've been going there for six years and she is always very pleasant to me}  MTGIOWST:  {leaning over counter - raised eyebrows} ah, ah, ah... can I have someone else make them please?  NBSP:  {shrugs, begins to make the sandwiches} ...  MTGIOWST:  {now leaning on counter supervising the microwaving process; nodding} good.  AAAARRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!! Why do people like this even exist?! What the freaking hell can this guy's life be like that he needs to be this much of a self-satisfied  ASS  in front of his wife/partner/girlfriend/casual aquaintance/total-stranger-who-just-happens-to-be-sitting-at-the-same-table and kid?????  I hate him. I really, really do.  O.K. now then, back to me.    I am at work right now testing an application. Now, boys and girls, I know there are those out there who might tell you otherwise but don't you think  for a minute  that testing is not Fun Fun Fun!! (!!) Actually, I've only just started testing. The bits I really wanted to look at, I can't get to work so I'm more  sitting and staring   and occassionally  cursing  as I drag my  tired ass  back over to the   stupid cube   where our   stupid test machine   is sitting so i can restart the   stupid webserver  ... I'm also drinking  coffee  (gasp!) which probably accounts for my  surly attitude . I'm telling you, the switch back to tea didn't come soon enough! (Disclaimer: I'm  only  drinking this cup of coffee because the  OTHER  person who is here today just handed it to me and it seemed  really wrong  to smile up at his drenched face and say "Hey, thanks for leaving the building, going out into the rain and struggling back through both locked doors with  two  cups of steaming hot liquid, but I'm actually not really drinking coffee anymore. That stuff'll kill ya!"). Take that,  MTGIOWST ! This is what   courtesy   looks like!     Alrighty then, whilst we wait for  yet another  re-start, coupla quick things re: this past holiday.   1) Co-parenting sucks. Maybe it's just me and my raised-by-a-single-mom ethic but seriously, there is nothing more disconcerting than having it demonstrated to you  yet again  that somewhere in the world is a  relative stranger  whom you didn't actually like/trust/value enough to stay with forever but whom for some  inexplicable  reason has an  equal claim  to the person you love more than anything else ever. I mean WTF?? O.K. granted it's not that bad but still, it's wierd. It's wierd realizing that there are  two  people trying to instruct and instill values and sculpt  one  little mind and that those two people are not together mostly because they could not re-concile their world views. Those same world views, I might add, that are getting foisted upon an innocent little  sponge person  who is then tasked with trying to sort them all out in such a way as to not offend any of the  sixty-thousand  adults who are depending on her to make their lives perfect...   As you may have intuited  CP  and I had a slighty rocky  Thanksgiving , mostly because it was just us with no one around to run interference.  Boo  is still having issues with  Demon Child  at school and  CP  is of the opinion that  Boo  "should just walk away." Now, I was there on Wed. watching them on the playground and while it may be a  great idea  in theory, it just doesn't seem like the simplest strategy to implement so I suggested perhaps  Boo   remember  that she could just walk away but that maybe we'd try to figure out something else as well.  CP  took what I was proposing to be  exclusive of her  and bristled. I took her bristling as failing to understand the real-life situation and got annoyed,  Boo  tried to run interference by changing the subject to the brownies we were making and we all tr-la-la'd it from there...   I think the  main problem  is that the two of us aren't usually trying to parent at the  exact same time  in the  same space  so when we do, it feels like we're stomping all over each other's ideas...  My  solution, along those lines, would be to just never be in the same place at the same time but I sense that both  CP  and the  Boo  might be unhappy with that little arrangement so I'll have to see what else I can figure out. One thing I did notice was that  CP  is better at Co-parenting than i am. I think this because she is able to recognize me as an equal parent and can share/relinquish her role when I'm around. I cannot. I mean, I understand that she is also raising our kid but at the same time I just cannot step back. When I'm around  Boo ,   I'm   her parent and that is just the way it is. I expect her to follow my rules, heed my advice, turn to me if she needs assurance -- regardless of who else is there. Furthermore, I don't see this as a major problem so it's unlikely that I will change. {sigh} I just don't think I'm cut out to "co" where parenting is concerned....

       It's Lord of the Flies all over again!  Hallo class!  Today we're going to reflect on a few of the things we witnessed during today's play-yard observation but first some stuff about ME.  Registered for my Spring classes first thing this morning -- O.K. can I just say, sometimes I get the distinct impression that I (and my life) am a button attached to the end of a string. the string is mostly invisible and is always taut so usually I think it's just me (the button) hanging out, rolling along, doing all those  adorably annoying  things that somehow manage to both  piss off  and  enchant  the masses on a daily basis but then something like my  school registration  comes up and I realize that I have no control at all and in fact I am simply a button being pulled along by this string to all the places, people and situations, I need to interact with to have things continue to function in a way that will cause me some happiness and, at the very least, smaller amounts of heartache.   Case in point: I did not know I was supposed to be registering for classes today. I quite simply was not in any way aware that the reg period was fast approaching and that there would be a fine (200.00) if I missed the cut-off and registered late. Then, last night in class,  Hottie Prof.  has me chat with a girl who is very nice but whom I  typically do not talk to  about cross-registering at Berkley and during the course of our conversation she mentions that the reason she wants to cross-register is because the class she wants into is full prompting me to inquire how she knows it full to which she replied that (it being near the  end  of the registration period) you could go on-line and see what was left. (!!)   So, all of a sudden I'm faced with needing to register for classes the next day. Which, co-incidentally enough is the day I have off from work anyway. So I move some things around time-wise and arange to be at the school right at 9:00 when the center opens. Upon arriving i recognize a classmate of mine from last semester and (again in the midst of a   casual conversation  ) she tells me she's registering for this   policy   class taught by this  great teacher  who usually doesn't teach evening classes and that it's open to grad students (!!)  As  I'm standing in line figuring out what to take...! Is that not just bizzarre?? I dunno. "Co-incidences"/Luck like this happens to me all the time but sometimes i swear it's just too calculated to be random... Anyway, I'm happy. I'm taking "Public Policy: Issues that affect Women and children" and "Quantitative analysis" (whoo hoo! You gotta love you some number crunching!) Anyway, I jsut thought it was eerie... Moving on then, back to the play-yard...     So, some of the things I noticed about the  1st graders  at my kid's school while they were at recess:   There's one girl who seems to prefer playing with the boys. (I originally wrote " always  plays with the boys" but my brain is in "objective assessment" mode so I had to qualify it.) It's interesting because although she is included as a member of their pack she is not treated the same. All the decision making about what is going to be played next, what the rules of the current game are, who gets to tackle who should someone have both the football and the tetherball and be unwilling to give one up... are made by the boys. The boys throw the ball, catch the ball, kick the ball. On the one occassion I saw where the girl got the ball it was because a wild kick sent it off under the bench and she got to it first. Once she had it the boys treated her like they would any other boy - screaming for her to alternately throw it to them/at someone else but once she did throw it they stopped paying attention to her again. And it's not like she was being shy or "letting" them ignore her; she was right there, yelling , dodging, suggestiong, etc. They were just, as a group, not seeing her as someone who should influence them.   The boys tended to play in big groups while most of the girls played in groups of three or four. Also the girls were all over each other - pulling each other around, picking each other up, hugging, pouncing, etc. The boys didn't really touch each other while they were playing although they did touch each other when they  stopped  playing. There were lots of pushes and backpats and pokes when everybody lined up but when they were actually engaged in a game it seemed to be more about how far they could stay away from each other.   Secrets are bad. This was announced to me during one of the frequent demands for my council wherein a group of about four girls (quickly joined by four others) came marching over to inform me that  C  wanted to speak with  Boo  privately but that that wasn't fair because you're not supposed to have secrets and anyway it made  A  feel bad that she wasn't included. For the record i told them that "speaking privately" was not the same as "telling secrets" unless it was done in order to make someone feel bad and that   Boo   was the one who got to decide whether or not she felt like being "spoken privately" to... which I gather was somewhat unorthodox because everyone looked a little surprised.  As they were walking away one of the little girls whispered to another little girl that " Boo  got to pick because her mom's here..."    The concept of "Being popular" seems to hang on a child differently based on whether you're a boy or a girl.  Boo  seems to be very popular with her little group in that there was much tussling over who got to play with her and much discussion over who she "liked better" yet it was patently clear that this type of "popularity" was not making her particularly happy. In fact, it was making her worried-looking and a little stessed. on more than one occassion she just walked away from the squabbling group and ran across the playground to come lay on my lap and relax for a minute before one of the other girls came to collect her. By contrast the most obviously popular boy (him being the one who was most obviously orchestrating the larger games and whose opinion was sought out by the others in the group should there be a need for a ruling vis a vis some interaction) was loud and confident and clearly comfortable with his position. Then too, for him popularity seemed to mean he got to order people around. For  Boo  it seemed as though  she  got ordered around more.   There was one little girl who the other children just don't play with and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. She's small, tinier than  Boo  even, quiet, polite, loves to get hugged.... It's strange. She seems to crave attention - my first day observing she came running up and threw her arms around my leg, smiling happily  before  asking who exactly I was... And I've seen her give the other children hugs (she's always hugging  Boo ) and when I mentioned to  Boo  that maybe she'd like to play,  Miss Boo  shrugged and went over and invited her to follow them in their game but kids just didn't seek her out to play with. I'm going to see if  Boo  can tell me when next I get a chance to talk to my kid because it was just so  not  obvious to me why she'd be an outcast.    Kids play be their own rules. If you don't have something to bring to the table, you are not interesting to them. It doesn't seem to matter what it is though, just that you can do something interesting. A number of times I saw kids just stop what they were doing to watch some other kid do something interesting for a bit before running back off to play. And kids who noone was playing with, if they managed to get a hold of a ball or suddenly got very interested in their shoelace, would suddenly find themselves part of a group who would swirl around them until they became uninteresting again then they would disperse. The thing is none of it felt mean-spirited, really. Everyone was basically polite -- it was just very clear that these kids had to have a reason to notice you. In other words empathy didn't seem to be the prime motivator out there on the schoolyard this morning!  Whew! Anyway, those were ust some of the things I found to be interesting this mornign whilst out watching my kid interact with the other kids. Man, I'm kind of glad i'm a grown-up (kind of. I'd forgotten how fun teatherball can be!) Anyway... my lunch is finished and now I'm just avoiding real work so i'm off...  I hope everyone has the very best  Thanksgiving  ever! Ciao, for now!

      well, it's late (ish) and I'm tired because I've staying up writing stuff and making stuff and testing stuff and I have been home from school for two hours now and for some obscene reason I am not asleep. I'm not even sleepy. I mean I am sleepy but not in the way that I need to be in order to GO . TO . SLEEP .... so... here I am blogging.  Have I mentioned lately, how much I like school? I heart school. And it's NOT just because my  professor  is soooo amazingly smart and cute and nice. I just like it is all. oooo! Two interesting things happened tonight.   1) A girl in my class told me that  my  paper (the one I wrote on my leadership project last year) was used in her class last week as the "model paper" -- meaning students who didn't know what sort of paper they should write were shown  mine  as an example(!!) An example of  what , I have no idea....  2) I found out that   tomorrow   is the last day to register for classes for the spring. I found this out in a  casual  conversation orchestrated by my aforementioned cutie teacher   {sigh} Anyway, so, it would appear that I am registering for classes tomorrow before I go to  Miss Boo's  class for my second round of "observations" (for the paper that I'm writing in one of my classes, not because I think there's anything suspect about the way  Boo's  schooling is being conducted.... Actually, just for the record, Boo's teacher rocks!) after which I'm going into my actual work place to finish one project and begin testing on another one (yay, me!) And you wonder why it is I feel the need to stay awake all night when I quite obviously would be doing well to rest the hell up for my big day tomorrow?? ME TOO! {sigh again, albeit more of a resigned one than the former which was definitely more "crushy"} I'm gonna go lie very still and see if my body can rest control of my mind for a least a few hours....

       "It doesn't matter if you're a star...  Doesn't matter who or what you are! Just grab a guitar And get to rocking That's rock and roll!  Found a  Shaun Cassidy  tape at  Community Thrift  for a dollar (is it just me or have they gotten  hella  expensive?? C'mon kids, it's not like you're  Amoeba West !) And I have just  got  to say, my goodness, it's been a long time. Let me begin by putting it completely out there that I was an active member of the  SC  fan club; I had his album on vinyl (in fact it was  my number one make-out partner  during those lean years between 11 and 17); I watched every single episode of Hardy Boys (including re-runs) and I even went so far as to temporarily disown/stop speaking to my best friend  Cammy  when she dared to suggest that perhaps, just  perhaps  (she later recanted)  Parker  might be the better boyfriend of the two...(!!) So, anyway, popped in that tape and hand to God, I was twelve again - bouncing around in my seat, grinning like a maniac at the boys in the  Chevy Malibu  next to me ("Da Doo Ron Ron Run"? Anybody?? c'mon, they were in a   Malibu   you know they were feeling me!) I even teared up a little when we got to the "sad" song: "Mornin' Girl...."  "Well, a man is hard to find in a woman's land"  Oh, don't let too many tears, wash away your dreams!  Just tell yourself that nothing matters {sweeping musical crescendo}  just be prepared..."  I mean, sure it makes  no sense  ("hard to find a man in a women's world? WTF?) but still!!! That little  emotional warble  he throws in at the end freaking slays me!!      K. So, last night I went to the  urlLink 8th annual Miss TrannyShack pageant  with my buddy  Angel  which basically means, I went by myself.  {This is us preparing for the evening in the tiny, crowded, yet still disturbingly tidy bathroom at Angel and Dirty Boy's aparte-mont}   Chick:  Don't leave me tonight.  Angel:  {peering intently into cracked mirror - applying the  second  set of false eyelashes} I will not leave you tonight.  Chick:  Promise.  Angel:  I promise.  Dirty Boy:  What're you guys doing tonight?  Chick:  We're going to Tranny Shack. Angel says he's not going to leave me to go running after some girly boy but I don't believe him.  Dirty Boy:  {to Angel} What about  Texas guy ?  Angel:  {rolls eyes} What about him? I am not going to  pick up  boys. I am going to hang out with my dear friend  Chick  whom I never see and who I love {stops for a moment to survey what I like to call an outfit} and who needs to change her top.  Chick:  Change my top?? What's wrong with my top?! I love this top! And who even says "top" anyway??! It's a shirt! I'll bet you say "soda" too...! {Angel rolling eyes  again  flicks light switch on wall shutting off primary illumination and magically turning on black light revealing thousands of shimmery cat hairs and what looks an awful lot like a Monica Lewinsky-style man-juice stain smack in the middle of my chest} Fine. What have you got for me to wear. { Angel  produces fairly cool sequined baseball shirt;  DB  smirks at stain,  Chick  mumbles through disconcertingly complicated "top"} Promise me you won't leave me.  Angel:  {back at the mirror} I promise I will not leave you.  {At venue}   Angel:  Ohmigawd, look at her!  Chick:  You said you were going to stay with me!  Angel:  I am staying with you. God woman, you have got some serious abandonment issues --  As far as I am concerned we are Martin and Eng.  Chick:  Who?  Angel:  Martin and Eng. Those Chinese twins. The ones that were stuck together...  Chick:  "Martin?"  Angel:  Whatever. Didn't they end up getting married?  Chick:  Who?  Angel:  Martin and Eng!  Chick:  I don't think the one twin's name was "Martin"  Angel:  Whatever darling... {scans crowd} I'm getting drinks. Wait here. Don't want to lose my better half, ha ha! {moves off into crowd smiling happily into beautifully mascaraed faces}  And, yes, for all of those of you who guessed that that was the last time I saw him you are  correct ! Diane, tell em what they've won! Bitch.  No worries though, our  Chick  is nothing if not resourceful and quickly made friends with some  German chick  and her "here for six months to study dance -- have you been to the Lexington club?" eentourage. All brillant people and particularly nice to have someone my size to commiserate with when the sweaty, vaseline covered (albeit still rather hot) gay boys finished their musical numbers and decided to climb en masse onto the platforms where we we also  sort of trying  to occupy space. They were pretty respectful though -- asking if it was o.k. that they were sitting on our feet/leaning their stinky, man-sweat-soaked bodies against our pristine, formerly girl smelling thighs --  so it was all good.   For the record, my love affair with the beauty that is the  urlLink tall ,  urlLink goddess-like ,  urlLink drag queen  continues unabated. I mean, seriously, you would be hard pressed to show me a gesture that is so completely evocative of a  swan sailing past  on a warm summer night as the gesture that is an impossibly tall, amazingly sequined, pink-haired creature bending forward with an accomodating smile (always with the  smile!) to better hear what some lackey has to say to her. Simply put, I was dazzled. By the way, last year's  urlLink Queen  performed this year as well - that girl is   hot  !  I was also introduced to a  new concept  -  Girl Drag Queens . Not  urlLink Drag Kings , but Female bodied persons dressed in Tranny drag, lipsyncing to catchy pop songs. There was a girl there last night who was  amazing  (her performance was so freaking awesome it practically brought the damn house down) and I'm sure if audience response was any measure she won hands down (I left circa 1:00ish to drop some  Germans  off in the  Mission  then crawl back into my oh-so-inviting bed -- right this second?  Dying  from lack of sleep. Thanks for asking.) so I didn't see who won but it does beg the question of what one has to be to be  TrannyShack Queen . I mean, isn't kind of the  point  that you're  Transgendering  it up in some way or another. Not that girls in general are somehow closer to Drag Queens than boys thus giving them some kind of unfair advantage -- they're not, I checked -- but I dunno, it still sort of seems unfair, maybe because she was sooo good. It's like  "Martin"  and  Eng  being allowed to take part in the annual   South Valley Pride picnic three-legged race  ... Anyway.   VH-1  was there so look for me soon on your local cable station. K. This is already far too long so I'm outtie but I just have to say on a final note: Spoken word? Especially if you're not Laurence Fishburn; has  NO  place in the talent portion of a TrannyShack show... Sorry, but it's just not the crowd-pleaser it once was....      One last  urlLink freebie ...

       I'm going to hell  {phone rings}   Old Friend:  Chick?  Chick:  Yes?  Old Friend:  Hey! It's  Old Friend !  Chick:  Oh, hey. How's it going?  Old Friend:  Good! How're things out there?  Chick:  Good.  Old Friend:  Cool! Hey I just talked to  Dirty Boy  and he says you're doing well. He said you're really being great to him!  Chick:  Oh... really?  Old Friend:  Yeah! He said you're totally taking care of him and making sure he's "hooked up" {laugh} whatever  that  means...  Chick:  Uh, yeah, heh heh...  Old Friend:  Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks anyway, I mean, I know he kind of just showed up and {lowers voice} I gotta say, we were a little bit worried when they said they wanted to go out there... {lowers voice further} Did  Angel  tell you... He thinks he's...  gay ??  Chick:  Oh, um, yeah, he mentioned it. I mean I'm cool with it, you've only got one life to live right?  Old Friend:  Yeah, I guess. It just seems a little... I mean, I don't know... he's just, you know....  Chick:  Yeah.  Old Friend:  Well, {dismissive laugh} maybe he'll meet someone nice out there and it'll all take care of itself. He probably just needed to get away for a little bit. {laugh again} Hey, got any girlfriends you could set him up with?  Chick:  Ha! Um, yeah, I mean, not really... I think he's doing just fine on his own. I'll keep an eye out though, heh heh...  Old Friend:  Cool. Hey, is  DB  seeing anybody? I asked him what he was getting into out there but you know how he is...  Chick:  Uh, yeah, I sure do... Um, I think he's seeing this one girl...  Old Friend:  Really? Is she nice?  Chick:  She's cool.  Old Friend:  Is she pretty?  Chick:  Uh. Yeah, I guess... she has pink hair and lots of holes in her face... [I didn't really say that last bit]  Old Friend:  Well, that's good. O.k. I'm going to go. Just wanted to check up on the  Baby  Brother.  Chick:  Well, thanks for calling, maybe we can have lunch or something next time I'm in  New Mex .  Old Friend:  Yeah, that would be great!  Chick:  K.  Old Friend:  Hey, Chick...?  Chick:  Hmmmm?  Old Friend:  {lowers voice} I know I don't need to tell you this but... could you kind of keep an eye on  DB ? Sort of make sure he's not getting into anything he can't handle?  Chick:  Um, sure. I guess... Yeah, no problem  Old Friend:  Cool! Thanks, you DO NOT know how glad I am that you were already out there. I mean, it just makes us feel better that he could be out there with someone who's established, you know? Who  knows  us, who can kind of take care of him...   Chick:  ...  Old Friend:  Anyway, I'll let you go. Thanks for looking out. I'll see you soon, K?  Chick:  K.  aaaaaarrrrrrggggggggg!!!!!!     On a completely unrelated note - this morning in the elevator some man asked if my kid went to a   urlLink Montessori   school. I said "nope" to which he replied "Wow, you look exactly like a  Montessori  parent I used to work with. Hmmmm. I look exactly like a " Montessori  parent" on the one hand kind of interesting, on the other, makes me want to go home and change into something with stains in obvious places....

       Jeanine Garofalo naked!!!!  Have I mentioned how much I like  Ms. Garofalo ? This morning, for some reason which I have not yet figured out, I found myself thinking "hmmmmm, haven't heard from  Ms. Garofalo  in a bit, wonder what she's up to?" I then did a quickey web search and came across  an  urlLink interview  with  Eddie Vedder   and this site which is penned by some  urlLink  guy   and which interestingly enough, has nothing to do with  Jeanine Garofalo  but upon which he posted, as a kind of litmus test the following phrases:  Jeanine Garofalo naked  Jeanine Garofalo nude  Jeanine Garofalo pics  just to see what kind of traffic he'd pull in. I don't know about you but I find this fascinating... (I mean, he pulled  me  right?) That plus the fact that he sounds like my cousin in Minnesota (which is not bad; just very, very,  STRAIGHT )... Anyway, moving along...      urlLink The girl I like  has this to say about orchestras:   I love orchestra, it's my favorite because I feel like I can actually let go of all my self-conscious hangups and just enjoy music, enjoy contributing to something much larger than just my instrument, something that makes sense on a broader deeper level.   O.K. now I bring this up because part of the reason I am so freaking fascinated by her is because she is honestly in love with something I know nothing about. I mean, this is her life -- music. Not just music but  orchestral music . Well, it's not her entire life (at least I assume) but still... I dunno, I just think it's  pretty phenomenal  to be young and talented and finding  real holistic beauty  in something that is not specifically packaged, aimed at, marketed toward, whathaveyou, "youth today". K. sorry, i'm sensing that this whole post is going to be kind of  rambley  but what're ya gonna do? No, seriously... What.are.you.gonna.do??!     Last and probably least in all this is the fact that we're having  another   bake sale  so I'm surrounded by  mounds of sugary-goodness ! mmmmmm. bake sales. Anyway,  made  brownies  (again) and every time I go through this particular exercise I find myself thinking "Dammit, why didn't I leave half of these at home?!" This morning is no different and as I'm  digging through my wallet for change so I can go  buy back  one of the brownies I made, I am once again forced to confront the wonder that is modern day existence in the corporate world... ah. well... c'est la vie and all of that...

       At least they're not psychopaths...!  I don't know about you but I find that every so often I feel the need to stop what I'm doing and reflect (really  reflect ) on the fact that regardless of all the  highs and lows  of my former  relationships  and the  myriad reasons  why my  "then-partners"  became  "Ex"s , no matter what else I  could  say about them (and granted that's  not much  since they -- every last one of them down to their  spangley tipped blue seude shoes , were   princes   who deserved better than my  pathetic self  in their lives... except for that  one ...  she  was a kind of a pain...  kidding ! Anyway...) they were  not  (and continue to not be)  psychopaths . I bring this up because there's a new girl here at work who was just telling me about her  ex  ( psycho !) who currently has nothing better to do than drive by her new apartment trying to see if she and her daughter are home.  Great ! Yeah, I know I'm lucky, but seriously, the  extent to which I am lucky  occurs to me now again in all it's fullest   glory   and I find I must stop, take a minute and  thank all those people  who have given me  bits of themselves  throughout the years and who didn't (tempting as it may have been) turn into   pyscho-beasts   when the time came to give those bits back.  Bless you.    In other news, my kid likes  old books . This is only a  little  spooky because I, myself LOVE old books and I have a  entire shelf  devoted to  weathered, leatherbound masterpeices  I've collected (mostly from my  G-ma's house ) over the years; but still, it  is  slightly disconcerting because the  kid  has  sixteen thousand  books of her own plus a good  four square feet  or so of  MamaChick  books within easy reach yet she still went to the trouble to clear off the ottoman, stack up some pillows, and balance precariously on one foot while she reeeeaaaached up to grab a particularly dingy (mmmmmm, dingy leather books.....) tome which she then brought to the couch so she could hold it upside down and pretend to read it.   Now, seriously, I ask you, I'm thinking there's  no possible way  the love of old books could be  genetic  but still... it's not like she ever sees me reading them, I just like staring at them. Anyway, I found the  book  last night when I was (eh, hem) "cleaning the living room" (aka sitting on the couch watching  urlLink Joe Millionaire ) and noticed that were I to have had a  child  placed with us and were the  social worker  to make one of their  impromptu visits  then they would no doubt be  thrilled  to learn my six-year-old is reading " Callhouse Madam ." Yup, bring on the kiddies...!     Here are some interesting links I found on the  urlLink Amish Tech Support  site. I was going to do some involved intro to each but I'm too tired.  First, the  real  news...  Meatloaf is rushed to  urlLink hospital    Then the rest...  If you can't vote do you have  urlLink rights ?  and,  Americans  are " urlLink different " -- and I don't think that's "different", Ha Ha...

       Whew!  That was hairy! Meetings all morning and more this afternoon. Sheesh! Anyways, week-end was splendid! I had several hot dates (mostly with very small children) which was great! Took the eldest of the  B children  to see  Boo's  movie then met up betwixt and between with the ever-fabulous  Travelin' Man  who's freshly back from "backing" around various places considered "out" who was squiring the  B-Twins  about town and who is my own  personal repository  for all great ideas vis a vis assembling things from glass/metal. ( Mr. TM  also brought me back THE WORLD'S COOLEST PRESENT from  Aussie-land , that...or rather those, being  circular refrigerator magnets  from some  chicken eaterie  out there with the words "  Chick Magnet  " emblazoned pon them. We wuv!)    O.K., quick which line of the following statement made MamaChick  DIE  after first dissolving into a puddle of  gushy kid-love  when delivered with an absolute serious face by her  Boo :   Boo:  A. [horrid child from school] was mean to me today.  Chick:   Whad she do?  Boo:  She asked me who I liked better and I said C. so she hit me.  Chick:   She  hit  you?  Boo:  Yeah. Then i tried to ask her something and she just walked away.  Chick:   Well, [thinking: she  hit  you???! seething hatred building up, developing plans to have child arrested and/or excommunicated] I wouldn't take it personally. I don't think she's a very secure little girl.  Boo:  What's "secure"?  Chick:   When you feel safe and listened to and loved.  Boo:  ...   Boo:  I'm secure.  Chick:   [Dying!] You sure are! [Still and all though that kid is  toast !]

       More later promise...!  I'm going to post the usual  long-winded ramble  about the  week-end of champions  just past but before I can do that I must go meet about " naming conventions ." So, in the interim, since I can't just sit here not typing  anything , let me instead remark on the fact that  the girl I like  just got the world's  urlLink coolest coat ...! Why, oh why, must I live in a "temperate clime" wherein your outter wear choices are either "light" or "ski"??!   Also, got my paper back from my  Beautiful Professor . She's mad at me because I managed to mangle  every single existing   urlLink APA  citation formatting standard known to the modern world. What??! It's not like I'm in grad school or anything...! Oh... wait...   K. I'm outtie...

       Being Bi  What being Bi means...  Being "Bi" means that if you're on  MUNI  and you notice that  some boy  has a  particularly nice butt  you  immediately  start looking for a  girl  with a  separate yet equally nice  bottom so you can  justify  your attraction to the  Boy butt  without feeling like some   visitor   to the land of all the other  attractive-yet-for-some-reason-still-not-getting-laid heterosexuals .  Being "Bi" does  NOT  mean that your chances of aformentioned laid-ness are necessarily any better, it really just sort of means you get  rejected  by twice as many people.  That is unless you're married to a  hot chick  and in an  open relationship  wherein you have a  boy or two  (and perhaps another girl or two)  giving it to you regular-like  on the side. Then, being "Bi" pretty much means  all cake all the time ...! at least that's what I hear....     So, today I am in a  good mood . Partly because I managed to make a  dear friend's  life hell ()Thanks  OG , I owe you one!) and partly because I just am. I had a fun evening with my kid, I had a relaxed stroll to the bus this morning where I got to watch two of the world's most  wondrous butts  swaying gently in front of me for close to five minutes. Seriously,  who can complain  with this kind of life?   Speaking of which, I was trying to explain to  Boo  this morning that she can't have  everything   all the time  and she at one point looked up at me with  absolute frankness  and said "Why not?"   Why not indeed? I threw out the old "Try concentrating on the things you have got instead of the things you haven't" (Thanks,  G-ma !) but I could tell she wasn't  particularly convinced  that that was the path she wanted to pursue vis a vis this whole "getting everything" stance. Well, you do what you can do right? I mean, i'd be cool if she  could  figure out a way to get everything she wanted all the time. It's not like I think it's somehow beyond her. I'm more concerned with whether or not she's happy in the interim....

       Bonus! Yay! Last night as I was walking home from BART, I happened upon  Best Buddy Q  waiting at the bus stop near my house and as such got to have a good  twenty minutes  of unexpected "hang out" time with her PLUS a bonus glimpse of the  ever-fabulous   Little Lu ! Sometimes the timing in my life is  just so right !   K. So, I  just  fired off an e-mail to all my assorted managers explaining my  "adoption plans"   again  lest they forget ( again ) that it's something I'm  planning to do  and neglect ( again ) to factor in time in which they must learn to live without me for a bit so that I can get my  New-Boo  settled in... I currently inhabit a very strange state of expectation wherein I never know if announcements like these will cause  every single person  in the entire world to  lose their minds  but heck, at least this time I'm ready for it.    In other news, I would like to offer a  clarification/rebuttal  re: yesterday's post submitted by a regular reader of our forum.   Apparently, it is the studied opinion of this individual that I "totally misrepresented" gestures and/or remarks made yesterday by this well-meaning  guest in my home  -- apparently aforementioned gestures/remarks were "a joke" and I have been advised that I should "stop thinking everything is about me." That being said, this individual would also like it known that he or she has "no interest" in pursuing relations with "a dried up tw**" like myself and as such I should "consider myself lucky" that he or she continues to occassionally become so "desparate" that they  appear  to be making themselves available to the likes of me.  Our lovely reader goes on to opine that I quite often come across as "a total c***" and that I need to stop "bad-mouthing other people's jobs" just because I "get paid to suck d*** all day" rather than doing actual work.   Right. For the record, I'd like to  formally respond  that I was  not  in fact making fun of anyone's  new employment . I feel that  phone solicitation  is a  valid and fabulous  way to make money and if I ever run out of d***s to suck, I may just look into it as my  next career choice . Above and beyond that, I think this reader's otherwise astute analysis of the situation as it occured in my livingroom yesterday is quite probably a correct one and I will therefore let it stand. [  DB=Whiney...Little...Prick.  ] Alrighty then, moving along...       Me  and the  Boo  (and the eldest of the  Missus B's  children) will be out and about this  glorious city by the Bay   either taking in a  urlLink flick  ( Boo's  actually in this so I would recommend everyone who is dying to say they knew her when queing up for some tix...) or watching some  quality acrobatics . This all depends on  permission  from the  Little B's  parents,  ticket sales  and  Boo-mood  so nothing is set in stone, just wanted to give a head's up to those stalkers out there trying to plan their next " crouch and wait ".

       Warm and sweet   Dirty Boy  is sitting here right now being sweet to me. By that I guess i kind of mean he's not being ANNOYING which is a weird way to define   goodness   but you take what you can get, right? Anyway, I bring this up because we are discussing his   NEW JOB   so I suppose   Congratulations   are in order! Our beautiful little  skateboarding child  will be one of those  fabulous few  who call you while you're trying to  eat supper  and attempt to harrangue you into purchasing  tickets  to the  police officer's ball . Note: He is  not  a police officer. He is not even close. So, if for any reason, you feel the need to  hang up on him  (and his cold-calling friends) but think perhaps you  ought not  because he  IS  the  LAW  after all -- no worries! Disconnect at will! Just don't be all   mean   about it since it's just a  freaking job  and it's not like he's intentionally  trying to ruin your life .  You know another thing I realized about  DB  (since he's sitting on the floor in front of me watching  urlLink Hedwig  I feel compelled to  write about him  --  mostly because he's not going to realize it until he gets to school and checks the site, hee hee) is that he's got  two modes : Annoying, arrogant, filthy mouthed, skater boy who could not freaking  catch a clue  if his life depended on it and sweet, adorable, really quite smart skater boy who catches far more clues than he lets on... But the thing is these   modes  , they can switch in the  blink of an eye . It's   disconcerting   I tell ya...!   Case in point, he shows up a little while ago; let's himself in (I know! Why give a  degenerate  the key to your house? Do NOT think I haven't had that  exact  thought many a time....!) and after helping himself to some tasties from the  fridge  decides he needs to find out what I'm doing. I (for those of you who like details) am taking a  shower . A nice long shower. The kind of shower that goes on for  hours  because you've basically decided to blow off the  seminar  you're auditing in favor of doing some  real work  that you need to finish by the  end of the month  and which, all things considered, you're kind of on a roll with and  since you're on a roll , why not indulge a little and take some time out to stand under a   warm, pulsing showerhead   for the  better part of an hour ... So,  DB  figures out that it's probably not the cat using all that water and decides to not  just  enter the bathroom but to actually go ahead and make himself comfortable (having a little sit-down, flipping through a magazine)  so, I being  gracious  despite the fact that I am being MASSIVELY inconvienienced ask in as  polite as possible a way  what the hell he's doing here, in my  town , in my  house , and in my  bathroom . Then realizing I really don't care, i ask (again, in as polite a tone as it's possible for the human voice to register) if perhaps he wouldn't mind getting the  hell  out so that I may continue my bathe. Instead of replying to this absolutely reasonable and measured request he instead replies "Come out. I'll dry you off."   Now. I think we all know a little of the  history  twixt the two of us and as we are also all well aware of the fact that I have  given up young boys  for  Lent  I think it comes as no surprise to anyone that I replied with a curt "Hell, no!" followed up with what seemed a fairly simple directive "Go do something! Go in the living room. Watch a movie or something. i've got stuff I have to do." (The voice may have trailed into a bit of a whine during that last bit but I would humbly ask that my readership consider that the stream of water was getting a bit cold). "C'mon" quoth he ( Quick note : there's this whole   thing   I do where I  completely ignore  the tiny voices screaming in my head and just do whatever it is I'm asked. I know. I'm working on it.) So, I say "O.K." and step out into the FREEZING-NESS that is my now cramped bathroom and allow  Mr. DB  to actually dry me off. With a nice fluffy towel. And you know what?   It felt  really  good!   He got all the crevices and stuff but didn't try to get frisky even once. Up one leg and down the other. Pat, pat, pat. ruffled through the hair; inside the ears; turn around so he can do the back... I don't think I've ever been so thoroughly dried...! All the while with this serious, frowney look on his face. Then, towel folded and draped over drying rack.  Bathrobe  offered, he picks up his magazine and wanders out into living room to flop down on couch. It's times like these when I realize that I'd marry him if he asked. So, feeling fresh and glowing and loved I finish up in the bathroom with some of the detail work before wandering out to join him in the living room only to be greeted by a grinning, sprawling  discusting  boy pointing happily to a certain  suddenly prominent  body part and inquiring whether or not I feel like "taking care of it"! EEEEEEWWWWWWW!!!!!! What the  hell  is wrong with boys???! Sorry, with  some  boys.... No. Not even "some" boys, ALL boys. What is it that  all  boys are really some  twisted combination  of  split personalities  and that those personalities are usually   completely opposite  ? Anyways. I threw my pen at him and told him to get the hell out of my house since I have to work. He, of course, took this to mean "Stay. watch a movie!" and for the last little bit has been sitting cross-legged in front of the TV having some yogurt. {sigh}

       My newest obsession  K. everyone go  urlLink here  and sign up and start reading about stuff and commenting on stuff. Go ahead, i'll wait... Hmmm hmmm hmmm {twiddles thumbs, checks bottom of shoe for possible rock inclusion...} You back? Great! How was it? Did you run across an article containing this series of sentences:   "Besides, what if being a housewife did mean your worries revolved around cooking and keeping the house in order? Is that any less noble than your worries revolving around total quality initiatives and process optimization so that the company you work for can make a little bit more money?"   If not, here's a link:  urlLink http://www.buttafly.com/originals/havingitall.php   You'll notice I actually took the trouble to  write out  the entire thing just on the off chance that someone out there for  whatever reason  isn't quite clear what the random occassionally  underlined word  means and thinks that perhaps it may just be a device for showing additional  emphasis . I went to this trouble for one simple reason. This is, in my opinion a  good article  written from a viewpoint that is rarely championed.   I mean I've heard lots of people attempting to justify  stay-at-home-parenthood  because it's  better for the babies , the  parent  gets  to be a part  of those all important   "milestones"  , it's more  cost efficient  since  childcare  in this country is feaking outrageous in terms of cost/month ( not  that I'm saying  decent kid-care providers  are not worth it -- I  absolutely  think that the wonderful woman who raised  my  child was  woefully  underpaid... I'm just thinking more in terms of more  state subsidies  or  corporation grants  to assist in offsetting child-related expenses) all of which are  absolutely valid  but how often is it that we hear the  plain unvarnished truth  that having "a   career  " in this day and age quite often   sucks   and that we in the  working-for-pay world  might just want to re-think our decisions to spend  eight hours every day  ensuring that by the time we reach retirement we will be unable to see (what with the daily exposure to flickering monitors, flourescent lighting and various chemicals wafting merrily around those vacuum sealed buildings), feed or bathe ourselves (Once the  carpal tunnel syndrome  really sets in we'll be lucky if we can even tug the  elastic waist  back up over our expanded, saggy bellies after a trip to the little programmer's room), or sit up straight (Mark my words, we will be a society of  hunchbacks  before the century ends). Now, I'm not saying I personally feel like joining the ranks of those who find their primary conversations tend to revolve around diaper wipes, bizarre rashes and the refusal to ingest anything green but seriously, considering the fact that the last lengthy conversation I had in this place was about how very wasted my  urlLink buddy  was this week-end combined with a blow-by-blow description of the  projectile vomitting  that accompanied this  urlLink bender ... well, it's just not like there's a clear distinction as to which is the  loftier  pursuit....

       I *heart* my friends!  All of em! Just love every single one of them into tiny little peices! K. Quick thank you (THANK YOU!) to the  urlLink boyz  at  Hayseed house  for their  timely intervention  into my about-to-become-HUGELY-frustrated-with-my-inability-to-transfer-files-to-the-server life. Granted they didn't actually DO anything other than sit there and watch while my (stupid) laptop suddenly decided to start behaving itself but you know what, sometimes I think that's what  tech support  is all about -- seriously, I think my machine can sense when it's in the presence of persons who know how to definitively kick it's 10gig ass (do the words "fresh install of the OS" mean anything to you   LapBoy  ??!) so it straightens up and flies right! Either that or it started working because I was hooked  directly into thier network ... Whatever, all I know is  Emerson  and  Pretty Boy , you collectively and individually  rock !    Other happenings around town included a viewing of  Cirque du Soleil - Alegria  which was  awesome ! Sort of a mixed reaction from the  Boo . She was loving it all very much but at the same time wanted to do everything she saw the performers doing so we kept saying "Well, if you practice   now , when you get big you can audition to be a part of the show." which almost worked until they brought out this little kid to be a part of one of the stunts. Stupid little kid. (Not really, but he/she sure did blow a really great explanation as to why exactly it was our  Boo  could not go be part of the show. It was almost scary how quickly it switched from "something she could concentrate on and do when she got big" to why exactly it was that  we , her   parents  , weren't a bit more well connected in terms of the circus world!)    Last but certainly not least,  quick observation  vis a vis all the really  cute people  in the world. This started with me thinking that some of my various  Exs  were really  quite attractive  as far as  categories of peeps out loose in the world  go but then  Tony  showed up looking very much the adorable boy and  some girl  on the elevator had it going on as well... so, just a general shout out -- If you are doing your part today to add to the beauty that is the world,  Good Job ! Keep up the good work. I, for one, am very much appreciative of all your efforts!

       And we're half way there...   K. So, turned in the  first  of the three " career make or break " projects to the  Head Honcho  this morning and she liked (Yay!) {huge, freaking sigh of relief}.  Second work project  is coming along nicely  due entirely  to the kick-ass  ministrations  of the  team  I'm working with so I'm not super worried about that one coming in  on time and under buget  (which, given that our  budget  is  zero  is actually kind of funny)  third project  is being studied today and may get a  major push forward  this afternoon in which case, it too, will be  all about the roses . On the  school  front,  four major papers  have been written; we still have  one group  presentation to do (next week) and  one more paper  for each class due but not until early  December  so we're good there. Re: personal projects, I have  one website  to build by the end of the month (eek!) which I have  not even started  the design for (double eek!) Meanwhile, the  Boo  and I are working on a  "Pick Us, Dammit!"  book for our  case worker  to take to the matching meetings that needs to be done by  Monday  (and which is A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E BTW) and somewhere in amongst all of this, I am going to want to HAVE SEX! (Not going to happen but gawd, sure would be nice... Anyway, moving along...) Oops, sorry. not actually moving along. Just realized it's meeting time so I'm off, off, off...   But first, quick  welcome home  to our  Travelin' Man , not sure what the opposite of "Outback" is -- "Infront"? k, just thought of  all sorts  of stupid jokes to the tune of "Down in front" that I'm gong  to spare you, my   beautiful and stylish audience   because i *Heart* each and every one of you more than life itself! (Did I mention we're going to see  urlLink  Cirque Du Soleil - Alegria   on  Sundee  with the crew? I only bring this up because there is the  slightest chance  that I love  Le Cirque  the tiniest bit more than I love some of you but, no worries, we can go to  counseling  or something and get it all figured out....) Also, my buddy  Saltlick  has ventured into the world of blogging so I've added him to my list of links, that he may  reap the largess  of mine own estate (Just don't go liking him better than me and spending all your time on  his  site instead of mine!! eh, hem. Sorry. Aboandonment issues. I'm fine now...) K. really. I have to go. would you  stop  with the begging me to keep writing...???????! Sheesh. You are a needy bunch today!

       Was that an earthquake?  Hmmmm. Nice to live in a place where the  rumbling of a large bus  can be so easily misconstrued! So... just got back from the first annual  Parent/Teacher Boo 1st grade conference . My child  "demonstrates good skills in the areas of language arts and math. She is a conscientious student and a sensitive, kind friend to her peers.  Boo  is a delightful student!"  {sigh} We  so  Heart that kid. On the one hand it's like "Of course!" On the other it's like "Wow! Where'd she get that from??" Either way it's  cool  and  nice  and I am  unbelievably blessed . Right. Back to work now...

       NakedHeads!  People should be naked more often. Not like in public or anything (Unless they're  phenomenally attractive  in which case it should be a  felony  to wear clothes unless it's snowing) but just in general. Like in their real lives. Just got home from work? take your clothes off and relax a little. Making din-din? Throw an apron on over your birthday suit and have at it! Just got out of the shower? Take a second or two to read a magazine standing in front of the ole heater -- I mean, seriously, whatever happened to the concept of the air-dry?? Now admitedly, being the semi-recluse that I am it is hard for me to determine the current state of America's nakedness, all I'm saying is I've been wandering around in nothing but skin for the last half hour or so and it feels pretty good. Then again, I'm brown. I have this theory about brown people always sort of feeling dressed but that may just be because I simply cannot understand how my lighter-skinned brethern manage to make it through the day without copious layers of sun-shielding clothes worn over a generous slathering of sunblock SPF 360. Anyway, crude, half-thought out, border-line racist generalities aside, I do have to say I like the nakedness. Now, though, I am off to school. You all will have to excuse me while I slip into something a little less comfortable.

       Mixed mood today   Was feeling fairly   fresh   and   sporty   this morning until I got the heads up from  El Torito  that  Todd  and  the Enforcer  were questioning my proclivity to " always " call in sick on  Mondays  - they were just wondering if there was "a situation they should be aware of." Now while my first response was f*** em! and my second was "Tell them I'm an  alcoholic !" my third  slightly more useless  exercise in checking out the  actual facts  as if anyone is going to care, was to review the  timesheet records .  Five  Monday absences in the last  6 months . One was to  register for school  (check, sent a lengthy e-mail to everyone even remotely interested in my billability), one was   Labor Day  , One was   Memorial day  , which leaves us with   two   sick days in 6 month. And we're back to   f*** em  !    Know what's nice though, getting a  sweet drunken e-mail  from a boy who likes my butt. I gotta tell ya,  never  underestimate to  power to charm  contained within a single straightforward compliment re: someone's body parts!     Let's see... what else.... Gosh, I think that's it actually. I'm just going to go put a finishing touch or two on my paper that's due tonight then I'm off to the first in a series of   very  important meetings ! Hooray, me! Hooray, meetings!

       Sick. Again. Still.  Yup, sick. Sitting at home. Not  so  very unhappy about it though since it's finally  feeling like winter  and the day is  crisp  and  clean (ish) and all I have to do is  NOT  concentrate on the  millions of things  yet to be done and focus (focus, focus) on getting better. Although, not super sure how that's going to happen what with my  chronic avoidance  of exercise, healthy food, vitamins, non-sick individuals and a decent night's sleep.... who knows, I've been  phenomenally lucky  lately (case in point: yesterday was a veritable orgy of good timing, minor miracles and parking spaces materializing out of nowhere) so maybe, just maybe, i will kick this latest bug as well. Probably not. it'd be nice though to have a night where I don't have dreams about suffocating/choking (damn, inflamed tonsils!!) anyway. I'm home. If anyone misses me overly much,  send  chocolate  .      Cute Boo Acrobatics Teacher  who I made a  fool  of myself in front of last week -- rides   motorcycle  . Nuff said.     Halloween  was fun. A bit light on the  T&T  onna counta   alternate plans   were developed by the somewhat  less than communicative   CP  so we had to do our  candy-grabbing  in SF fairly quickly before heading back to the  Oaktown  side to meet up with  other interested parties  for more Treating, thing was though, by the time we got to the  East Bay ,  Miss Boo  was pretty tuckered and we didn't have a known spot to disembark (we  might have  had I been informed of the plans earlier than  7pm Halloween eve  but there you go -- tandem child-rearing!  Joy !) Actually, though, I'm pretty sure it was just me who was disappointed/annoyed.  Kid  was tired at the end but still seemed to have a  swell time . She ran into  every single kid  in her school  all dressed up  and  high on sugar  so I spose it all came out in the wash.    Rest of  week-end  was fun as well. We went to the  urlLink circus  which was FANTASTIC. The  animal acts  were o.k. (dogs = cute; lady tiger tamer = o.k. in a  "didn't-get-eaten kind of way); The  people acts  though were amazing! Lots of  brown performers  which was nice. One guy  tied himslef up in knots  which  Boo   loved ! My personal favorites were the  Chinese Acrobats  (but I'm biased toward people throwing stuff around) also putting in an appearance,  Double Dutchers  and the  drummers  from  urlLink Drumline  all excellent but  OMIGAWD  there was this bit at the end where these  motorcyclists  from  Chile  raced around each other in a  CIRCULAR CAGE  for minutes on end without killing each other which was quite probably  the most astounding thing  I've ever seen in real life! Very cool. I'd recommend that everyone go next year or whenever they come back to the  Bay area .   Then, on  Sundee , me and the  Boo  did some  serious   laundry  (during which I became the recipient of  four  fabulous scenic marker drawings  -- yay, me!) and after which I dropped her off with the fabulous  Miss Tail  while I went to attempt  re-connection  with an  old friend of mine  who just got back from a trip to  India . K. mental note, when every response  to a query includes the word "years" e.g. "How old is she now?" "Six  years  old"; "How long have you been in this apartment?" "About two  years "; "when did you guys get married?" "Three  years  ago" -- all I'm saying is maybe a little more " keeping up " is in order. All of this is, of course, my fault. I am a loser when it comes to  just freaking finding time  to hang out. Sorry. The   life   keeps getting in the way. Apologies all round. (Not like it won't continue to happen, but at least know that I  intend  to see you guys. Honest, Keep inviting me to stuff, k??)    Now, as you may have noticed, given the sheer amounts of fun crap we accomplished, I had the  Boo  full time over the last little bit and I must say I'm becoming spoiled. i did drag her all over the known universe though and for that I feel a bit bad. I have to remember that I have access to her for probably (hopefully) the next 12 years so I should maybe not try to cram everything into the few week-ends we've had lately where she's mine all mine (Hahaha)!!!  eh, hem. Anyways, I'm going to slink back into bed now. Maybe more later if the mood strikes. Otherwise git back witcha later, Homes, Ciao!

       Warning!  This post contains venting of a "where's the soapbox??" nature so if you're  adverse  to such a thing (especially this early in the morning) here's a  urlLink link  to the truly twisted -- yet still strangely compelling world of   ultra-realistic Japanese sex dolls  ! Enjoy!  [Actually this whole site is really just  begging  to be thoroughly explored -- don't miss the pics sent in by the little ladies' " urlLink foster parents " --  Makes you re-think the whole concept of "bringing em up right!"]      Which , BTW, segues nicely into my mini-rant for this morning entitled: "What the HELL is up with this concept that each and every child has a primal/primary bond to the two people (and  only  those two people) who donated his or her genetic stock??" I mean there is SOME agreement that it is  possible  that should these  two  individuals be  dead  or otherwise prove completely unfit to raise a child that maybe some sort of  bizarre secondary bond  can form (maybe) between the child and a  non-one-off-genetically  related caregiver -- say a   grandparent   or heaven forbid, a   step -parent  ( same sex-second parent adoptive caregivers  are ONLY permissable if the white picket fence is firmly in place, one parent stays home and everybody is super secure in their  gender roles  lest the child "get confused" as to whom the "mommy"  really  is -- do NOT even get me started about that one!!) and the thing is I'm really getting sick of it. I'm sick of people who i otherwise consider fairly intelligent shaking thier heads in wonder as they murmur crap like "That's just so amazing that you'd even  consider  adopting. i mean, I know I'd always sort of wonder about her  real  parents..." or "That's so cool that you can  share   Boo  like that. I mean if she were  my  child I don't know if I could just  give her away  half the time..." And the always adorable flip-side to that statement: "Yeah, I mean, I've  considered  having a baby but there's just  no way  I could do it on my own! I mean a kid  needs  two parents right?"  Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I am NOT saying that children do not benefit from having two  responsible committed adults  in their lives who care about them and want to have a hand in raising them.  Of course they freaking do! But responsible/commited/mature/gives-even-half-a-shit does not (let me repeat for emphasis) does NOT equal "biologically related" and it sure as hell doesn't always have to mean "functional part of a committed couple"... Sheesh! Sorry. It just really pisses me off that on the one hand we have working bio moms freaking out about their kids "getting too attached" to their nannies and on the other we have government institutions keeping kids in foster placements rather than giving them to  proven , responsible  single  parents because someone somewhere decided that kids can  only   truly thrive in an environment where they are able to sufficiently bond with thier egg/sperm donors!!  k. {breathe} I think I'm done.  Happy Tuesday  everyone. How's the day working out for the rest of you?

        Does this make me a "Lady of Leisure"??  Ha Ha! Just got back from watching  urlLink LOTR:Return of The King  with the ever fabulous  Travelin' Man ! My goodness how  kick-ass  IS that movie??!   But first, Friday eve went with  Bendy Girl  to go see  urlLink City of God  which  kicked my ass  in terms of over the top unbelievableness that is apparently every day reality to people growing up in places like  Bendy Girl  grew up in... seriously, not a  light  film -- but good! I'd say excellent even. I was thinking about it way too much on Saturday so I  self-medicated  with a healthy dose of  urlLink Grease 2  and by the time  Stephanie  and  Michael  shared that crucial last kiss I had managed to come out about even....  Sat. (when not spent watching the  best movie  the 80's ever produced) was mostly taken up by laundry-doing, kid-missing and make-up sleeping (can one REALLY make up for thirteen years of lost sleep though,  really ??) then on to today,  Sunday , shopping with the famous  Miss Tail  (during which some TRULY fabulous shoes were purchased and "date" with  BG  was thoroughly analyzed -- nothing happened, but when one is a  dyke  even nothing deserves some scrutiny!) and finally hoooking up with the man, the myth, the idea guy himself,  Travelin' Man  for a little quality  LOTR  viewing... {sigh} kind of sucks that the  kid  had to be  stolen from me  for me to have such a  very fun time  gadding about with my pals but I guess, in the grand scheme of things, if one is to have one's child  wrested from one's grip , there are definitely worse ways to spend the ensuing days...

       Ta-Da!  Ladeez and Gentlemen...! Allow me to introduce the one -- the only -- the WebHostess with the Most-est...   Chick  ...   Magnet  !!! {general roar of approval from an appreciative and obviously soused crowd} That's right folks, our gal  Chick  has managed to showcase her prodigious talent in just a right enough light as to convince the nice folks at  urlLink  Good Vibrations   to  hire her  as their brand new  eCommerce Manager  !!!!!  Super cool things about this:  1) I get to work at the swankiest, girl-friendliest, co-opin'-est place currently in the sex biz world -- How cool is that??! 2)  Ms. B  is my boss! And she's  normal ![What is that I'm hearing?? A  possible end  to the rash of   COMPLETE FREAK BOSSES   who have had the good fortune of being able to label me thier own personal  butt girl  throughout the various peaks and valleys of my working career????] We heart  Ms. B  3) Did I mention that it is now part of my job to play with...er...ah... assess   sex toys ??  4) How very "time for a change" was it?? I mean, really... 5) Todd (Head ass current company) = ska-rewed! HaHaHaHa!!!!!!  Things that suck a little bit:  1) How much am I going to miss my  boys ???? ( Tony ,  SigTau ,  Mistah Lovah Lovah ,  EP ,  Sir James ,  Family Guy  -- you make my life here bearable and I'm so sad i won't be having you pop in unexpectedly and saving me from doing actual work...  sniff  I love you guys!!!)  2) I'm actually feeling bad about my little project. I mean, it's soooo almost there and it was kinda like the  CyberBaby  I never had and what if someone awful ( El Torrito ) gets put in charge of it and screws it all up??? {sigh, again}  3) And even if that someone doesn't screw everything up, i still kinda feel like I'm deserting my beautiful team who put in so much time nad effort and now I'm just walking away....  ah, well. You do whattacha gotta do right? People were building kick ass applications for computer asset tracking across large-scale insurance concerns long before i showed up and they will continue to after I've moved on... It's all relative i guess.  So, really, that's it. New job = me.  Christmas  was fabulous BTW, lots of downtime and hanging about with the  child  and  CP  (mostly with the child) before they flew off off off to the land of the  LA s. And now, they're gone and I'm sad and  child-missing  but in general doing well....!

       Whew!  Just got back from pimping...er...ah,  showing  off our app to a room of  potentially interested folks . There was lots of interest (although they were as impressed by the uber-cool mini-projector I brought to show it with as they were with the application but whatever, beggars can't be finicky or however that goes...) and I am happy (thrilled) that it is DONE! I also got some  fancy new leads  vis a vis this other huge part of the upcoming development phase so I'm pretty tickled right this second.     Now then, where were we??  Hullo folks! Long time no hear, eh? Gosh, It's is rare, I think that I feel "overwhelmed" I mean I  always  feel tired and like I've got fifteen tons of stuff to do  every single second  of my existence but, generally I'm pretty confident in my ability to get stuff done -  nawhattamsayin'? The last week, though, sheesh, butts were  kicked , my friends, butts were  seriously  kicked!   Anyway, where did we leave off with this little narrative? Ah yes, the  Boo  events.  Boo  events were  awesome . On  Thursday  eve the kid and the rest of the  1st grade group  got on stage and played  air guitar  to "We will rock you!" by  Queen  (which,  seriously , if the very idea's not bringing tears to your eyes then you haven't the  faintest  idea what  Christmas  is  really  about!)  then  we all danced around like maniacs for a bit before heading out into the rainy night home to our super comfy (now that i fixed the heater- yay, me!) house.  Friday  was the official  school winter assembly  wherein my child played a drum and spoke (spake?) a line from a poem about  Kwanzaa  that her class had composed. Pretty damn cool, I'm tellin' ya! I like having a kid.   Saturday  we had yet another show, this time in  Boo's  Acrobatics class which also was pretty ridiculously awesome; followed by brief appearance at  Miss Tail's Hannukah Party  where  Boo  throughly schooled me in Dreidel before the lights went out and we said our goodbyes -- then, yesterday, we went   ice skating  ! Yup, that's right  Chick  strapped  blades to her feet  and ventured out onto a surface that was slicker than a  plunging larid  (e.g the Artic Tern) who got caught in the  urlLink  Valdez oil spill   (dunno where that came from, sorry though...  urlLink bonus link ). The  Boo 's little buddy,  Eli  had his  B-day party  at the   urlLink Yerba Buena Ice Skating rink   and I just have to say, my little  Boo-ster  is  such  a natural!  I , however, am not. Luckily noone fell so I wasn't really required to do much more than escort the kid slowly around the rink. I do have to admit though that she managed to end the day skating on her own, fairly far away from the wall. I... well, let's just say, I pretty much knew every scratch, dip and break that railing had to offer and couldn't probably sketch a farily  accurate diagram  of such by memory....  Was  supposed  to hang with  Bendy Girl  for a bit on Sunday but those plans had to be scuttled do to sudden skating/scheduling conflicts. I, of course called to apologize/grovel effusively and was informed that I had missed my  one opportunity  to get close to her as she had plans (big plans) for the rest of the month. Being nothing if not  persistent , however, I managed to wheedle a mini date out of her this  Friday  eve (Whoo Hoo!) -- I promised to drive her around in my truck. Never, I repeat,  never  underestimate the appeal of a  urlLink red ford Ranger  with a customized rear bed on members of the fairer sex! Especially the butch ones, you'd think they'd be immune to it's myriad charms but dammit even boy-girls find it difficult resisting it's basic appeal!

       It's so funny because it's SO true!  K. just took the  urlLink  What advice would Christopher Walken give you?  quiz  by  urlLink Quizilla   and here are my results:       Ladies are your trouble!     "Okay....look....friend.  You've gotta stop thinking about the girl.  She...she lied to you -- your family knows it.  Look, I know that stings, like a wasp, like a wasp with teeth, baby!  Here's some walking around money.  Take it from me, go and get yourself a new suit. Not one of those JC...Penny jobs, but a good suit.  A nice fabric, like Wool.  Get yourself a wool suit and enjoy yourself.  See a cockfight, anything, pal?  Look, you're number one."  {sigh} i mean, I always kinda  knew  it but it's different hearing Christopher say it, yaknow?

I think... anyway. She's in my links now so go visit if you get a chance....

       You're not sure what you can say about it. It's not exactly offensive. Not necessarily sexual. But it is really creepy for a boss to create a desk display comprised of three naked Barbie knockoff dolls, one of them with her left side apparently having been melted with a lighter, as it is now covered in black and beige ripples where the dripping plastic dried.  They're not in any sort of sexual position. Just standing side-by-side on the edge of the desk, the first thing you see when you come into his office. And their arms are up in the air and they're kind of kicking their legs out. It just looks like they're walking someplace, nude (and severely burned), and they just saw a friend they're really excited to see. They're shouting hello.  When you went in this morning, your boss alerted you to the new addition to the dolls. It was a little toy guitar leaning against one of them. He said, "See? They're a band."  -  urlLink Pretty Girl     Brillant!

      I want to write like this...   Lean your nose away from your book about a writer having trouble writing a book to kiss her scalp and breathe in the smell of her skull for ten minutes. Her skull contains her brain, and her brain is what reminds her that she's in love with you. You owe her brain big time, so give it some kisses. About ten minutes worth is adequate tribute. Then go back to reading your book about a writer having trouble writing a book.  -  urlLink Pretty Girl

       Tired!  God, I am  exhausted ! Like really seriously tired. Bone tired. The kind of tired that cannot be addressed by simply "getting some sleep" -- nope, this is the type of tired that requires a  glass of wine , a  massage , and a good  14 hours of uninterupted rest  to fix. Now, since I   1) have no wine at my house,  2) have nobody who feels like rubbing my body at my house and  3) have to get up and go to work approximately 8-10 hours after any point at which I'm going to get to bed tonight   I would have to say that all signs are pointing to: TIRED FOR THE REST OF MY NATURAL LIFE!!!! {sigh} o.k. I'm better now.   No i'm not dammit, I'm still tired!  And how did I  get  so very  worn out , one might ask (not one who knows  even a little bit  about what I like to  call a  life   but definitely something that might occur to a  casual passer-by ). Good question. By hanging out with my  friends , chatting on the  phone , finishing  assignments  etc., etc., etc. that's how. In other words, I am currently exhausted because  I  dared  to attempt  to stretch my life  to accomodate some of the  fun possibilities  that suddenly made themselves available to me (!!) ! I know! What was I thinking??! So, yes, my  current state  is my own damn fault. Fine. still though... What would it take to build a life where the thought of  chocolate ,  sex  and  sleep  don't carry the EXACT same weight in terms of things I'd most like to indulge in right now... Actually, scratch those first two. I'd pretty much sell my soul for the last. mmmmmmmmm. sleeeep......

       Just a quick check-in  Setting up for the  holiday party  here at work and there are THINGS TO DO!!!!! Not really but there are those who think there are  THINGS TO DO  and so I must be in a constant state of  standing upright  lest I be labeled someone who has  NOTHING  TO DO???!  Anyway, big  Boo  performance plans over the next little bit. First, we have the  Winter Sing  on  Thursday  which will feature food and songs and drum pounding. Then, on  Friday ,  Miss Boo  will be featured in the  School Holiday Assembly  wherein she will recite a line from a  Kwanzaa poem  and lastly,  Sat . the delightful child will  delight and entertain  we proud parents as she (and her class) show us a few of the skills they've picked up this last semester in their  Acrobatics  class! I, for one,  can not wait !!! Now, since I know you're all feeling jealous and left out of the goodness that is  Boo-performance  right about now, know that I am attempting to arrange  videotaping  of at least  one  of the aforementioned events so if you're  very  nice to me.....    In other news, the Delightful  Miss Tail ,  Missy Miss  and the  CP  have returned from thier jaunt to the sunny reaches of  Matzalan . I have not actually  spoken  to any of them yet but I  did  recieve check-in via Voice Mail and they sounded  rested ,  tanned  and  chipper ! Yay! I don't know about the others but  Miss Tail  (IMHO) sure seemed to need a break. That girl is doing some  amazing things  with her life but gosh, she makes me tired just thinking about the various concerns she tackles on a daily basis...  {sigh} o.k. I really want to continue with the rambling but I am apparently needed to stand in the kitchen area so I'm off off off...! Have a wonderful day my  Little Snow Angels ! Mommy, loves you all very much!

       Well, Howdy there Honey!  How the heck are all my sweet little peeps? I am good. Week-end was GREAT!  Bendy Girl  sighting went well (well, actually it went kind of   serious   cause  EVERY SINGLE ADULT PERSON  in the auditorium suddenly decided they needed to have a word with  MY new girlfriend  -- KIDDING about the "girlfriend" thing BTW; just a little humour. Trying to keep things light...!  BBQ ,  OG ,   everybody  , breathe....) so we didn't really get to talk all that much and when we did  Boo  was sad so we were all being serious. I did check in with her later though and she and the  Boo  had a stellar little phone based tete a tete so I'm thinking it'll all be good.   Next,  Boo  and I tackled our   fifty thousand errands   and actually accomplished an  amazing amount  in an  astonishingly short time  (for some reason all the lines we were in were really miniscule -- dunno why, but hey, I'm not looking any gift pachyderms in the mouth....!) And we got a  tree ! We got a great  live tree  -- it's a   urlLink Norfolk pine   and it's beautiful! It's a cool shape too, not triangular like a standard (dead) tree but more "frondy"... Anyway,  Boo  picked it out and she also picked out the beautiful  chinese patterned pot  we planted it in and I am so excited because (theorhetically) we can just move it outside (  urlLink ??  ) when we're done with the  X-mas holiday celebrations  and perhaps use it again next year. I, of course say perhaps because we all know I tend to  kill plants  faster than you can say  Rice Crispy Treats  ("Rice Krispy Treats!!") But I will try to make a good faith effort!  Finally, yesterday was my  company holiday party . It was at  urlLink Teatro Zinzanni  which was  grand ; very festive and all that. Super-huge shout out to the fabulous  Best Buddy Q  for providing some quality  Boo  watchage. My kid loves you guys and she was so looking forward to hanging out with you! She kept saying "Is it 4:00 yet?" -- seriously, she had a really great time. Thank you sooooo much. Also thanks to  Pretty Boy  who was the   best date   a girl could want. You make me feel like a  big ole girl  whenever I'm around you and, dammit, I like it! Thanks for being in my life and thanks for being such a pal!  Hmmmmm...... let's see. what else...? Fixed my heater this morning. I am sooooo the gal about the house these days... OH! and my  Baby Brother  might be putting in an appearance next  Tuesdee  for a coupla days which is not only very great, but it alleviates the necessity for me to lug all their gifts to the Postal Office for shipping! Yay! Siblings rock! I strongly urge everyone to go out and get some!  K. I think that's it. Lunching today with  BBQ  then back to work to tie up a few party details. Nothing crucial/stress inducing... all in all I'm thinking today will be a very restful day.....

       Happy happy happy!  Today I am happy! Now, I've been happy before (I've been pretty happy for awhile now, actually) but today is the first day in a very long time that I've woken up knowing that there's not a single thing i have to  turn in  or  prepare for  or  present today  so while I still need to snap the hell into  Christmas mode  and commence with the shopping, X-mas tree buying, gift wrapping, present shipping, etc., etc., etc. -- I'm feeling remarkably calm right this second.  Plus , I get the see  Bendy Girl  tomorrow (yay! although wierd cause it's, of course, in the context of my  child's class  so I have to act like I'm pleased to see her while at the same time hiding my desire to push her up against a wall and just freaking GET ON with the making out!!)  Then  I get to see  both  my  BBQ   and  my  Pretty Boy  on Sunday! Seriously, if i sat right down and made a list of  scintillating persons  who I was most interested in spending some quality time  staring at  the  vast majority  of it would be covered by the end of this week-end!   Also, this morning heard from the  Landpeeps  that we're getting a  new neighbor  who also has a  little girl  so hopefully she will be cool and her child will be  swell  and  Boo  will have a friend to play with who lives right in front of us! Yay, again!   K. I'm out. Belated shout-out to   urlLink the girl I like   on her  award-winning accomplishment  earlier this week. She   rocks   and I hope there are people fairly close to her letting her know that on a daily (if not hourly) basis!

      Quick update re:  school project  -  Lovely Professor  received,  lovely professor  liked,  lovely professor  left what has got to be the  world's sweetest message  on my machine about how brillant/wonderful/cute I am [o.k. she didn't  say  the "Cute" part but it was there, between the lines!] so we are not only all good in terms of overall acceptable project completion, we are also fairly well fixed for a mid-break teacher-student hook-up at some point during the next coupla weeks to discuss my little game "at length" heh heh heh...

       In the zone!   Sorry, I just read that on a friend's post and thought it would be ironic to the nth degree to use it on MY site so there you have it!  So.  The date.  The date went well. Can I just take a minute here to admit to something? On some very intrinsic level I think I'm prejudiced against boys. Not like I don't like them or anything but i think I assume they're  pretty simple . Again, I mean that in the  best possible sense  of the word -- not trying to  cast aspersions  on any the   fabulous boys   who currently  so  have my back and are making my existence, in some  very intrinsic ways , worth living; I'm just saying, the way I relate to  boys that I like  is so completely (freakishly almost) different from the way I act around  girls that I like . That's the main qualifier BTW. "That I like." I tend to treat my  friends  the same regardless of  gender identification  although I have noticed I'm  far more likely  to just randomly decide to sleep with my  boy  friends than I am with my  girl  friends. More on that later. Maybe. Probably not though.   Anyway... thing is, if i like a boy and we're alone I just flat out jump on him. Even if I'm not sure I like them or we're just hanging out being buddies but something has occurred (alcohol, boredom, witty conversation, etc.) that makes me realize that it might not be such a bad thing to commence with the macking, I'll still just kind of jump on them. My assumption in these cases is that 1) If they are  not  interested they will just pull away, slap me and start sobbing (kidding!) or 2) If they  are  into the  sudden physical contact  that it will continue until we're both  tired/bored/hungry  at which point we will break for  sleep/TV/and/or food  and that will be that. Included in this is the assumption that there won't be any of that "So, what do we do now/where are we going with this/what do we do about your existing girlfriend?" nonsense at the end.   Seriously, I could spend all night  licking some boy's body  and  still  act all   surprised and shocked   when they mention that it might be nice to go grab some breakfast together. With   girls  , on the other hand, I  assume  there's going to be future crap to work out before I even know the chick's last name so I put all this energy into trying to  figure everything out  before we even get started. It's wierd. I mean, I'm on this date and I'm really wanting to just kiss this girl and I  can't   because I'm afraid she'll "take it the wrong way." And even I'm not sure what I mean by that. All I know is, I don't want to  offend  her, I don't want to  put myself out there  to get  rejected , and basically I'm spending all my time sitting there trying to find  clues  as to whether or not she likes me in the way she holds her  latte  -- it's pathetic.  So, back to that date thing....  The date was nice.  Bendy Girl  is hot! She is incredibly cute and the fact that she's relatively  normal , basically  sweet  and completely in  love  with the kids she teaches just adds to her overall kissablility. Plus, she kept taking her clothes off. Granted she was wearing like  sixteen layers  but still! it's disconcerting when someone whom you think is cute, suddenly decides mid-conversation to stand up and pull off their sweater -- and their sweatshirt -- and their rain pants...Nice. Unbelievably  sexy , but disconcerting all the same.   Now then, having said all that, I must now put it out there that the  Chick-ster  did   not get smooched   last night {sorrowful cries ring out from the balcony}. The two of us  did , however, manage to draft a  preliminary contract , work out some of the more pertinent  rules of our engagement  and to  reach a consensus  vis a vis the relative attractiveness of the two of us so I actually think there's some chance (about 15%) in hell that I'll be seeing exactly what a concentrated  Capoeria  regimine can  do to a body  up close and personal in the near future! Maybe. As it stands we have tentative plans to perhaps get together and continue our discussions at some point during the next two weeks, so we'll see how it goes.   Christ.   Sometimes, I wish boys had breasts!     Oh! and speaking of boys, big super-huge shout out to  Travelin' Man  who has parts of my back I didn't even know existed! Thank you soooo much for looking out in terms of  entertaining things  to do about town, potential  job opportunities , and ways to allow  Chick  to be closer to  power tools . You rock!

       Done!  Done. I am done.      I'm still done.    Yup. still done.     wierdest thing, I woke up this morning feeling like it was  Monday  but not like "F***! It's f***ing Monday!!" more like "Ahhhh, fresh new week, fresh clean slate...." Very strange. Anyway.   I turned in  the project  last night. my  teacher  wasn't there (she had scheduled another meeting right after ours and thought we were meeting  half an hour  earlier than we really were -- I'm o.k. with this because I know that she is really just on a fairly basic level COMPLETELY in love with me and the thought of this being our last meeting this semester was  tearing her up inside  so she "forgot" the time for our appointment and subsequently  had to leave  before I showed up. Whatever. It happens.) so, I left my  game  (that's right folks, I made the world's coolest  Policy/Inclusion/Empowerment game . I'll post pictures of it next semester when/if I can steal it back for a few minute -- otherwise you'll just have to wait for the public version soon to be released by  Mattel  [jk]) and high tailed it home where I then spent the evening  NOT  READING/WRITING about  education  but instead trying on  every single item of clothing  I own in preparation for the  Holiday party  on  Sunday  which our own  Pretty Boy  has agreed (after only minor amounts of  pleading/monetary bribes ) to accompany me to... K. Can I just say, Holiday parties are an interesting animal. On the one hand you need to get "dressed up" but on the other it's still "work" so your normal  dress-up/ho-bag  clothes aren't necessarily appropriate and if you're  me , your only other option clothing-wise is "week-end wear" which, if it's not ripped, stained and/or wrinkled it probably  didn't fit right  and is waiting to be returned to  Crossroads  -- I did find one  killer skirt  which I forgot I owned and a pair of  super high red heels  so at least my  bottom half  will  represent ... Maybe I'll go looking for something cute on Sat. in between starting/completing all my holiday shopping, taking the Boo to her class, cleaning my house, ridding my  refrigerator  of   ants   and checking in with the  Caseworker  re: the  total lack  of available children/the  supreme suckiness  of being told (yet again) that I "sound great!" and am "next in line" for a kid whose  currently being placed  with a "two-parent family." Apologies to all those "two-parent families" out there but c'mon! I'll put our little selves up against the  vast majority  of you   schmoes   any day of the goddamn week and I  guarantee  you I'll raise the less f***ed up kid! Sorry, just had to vent. I'm fine now.  oooops! meeting time. i'll write more later if I get a chance. Otherwise, Happy Wednesday! C'mon people, Rock it like you mean it!!

       A vote!  A  very nice woman  agreed to have  sex  with me today. That is, I  think  she did. We were at an  event  with  Family Guy  and his   adorable  family  (seriously, I don't think I've ever met  an entire family  that seemed so freaking  sweet ! It was a little  eerie  actually, like he went out and hired these people to represent the various family persons who'd i'd already heard so much about and already formed a pretty  stellar opinion  of -- although, I guess in retrospect they  did  match the photos he's got on his desk... anyway, a-d-o-r-a-b-l-e! The whole damn brood!) and this   girl  , whom I've mentioned before, and I start with the  chinwag  and I ask how her  Thanksgiving  was and she says "Great" and asks how mine was and I say "O.K." and  somehow  we start talking about how I only feel like I really need a  girlfriend  three or four days out of the month -- do NOT ask me how 1) we got on that topic, 2) how I suddenly found the chutzpah to even  discuss  such a thing with someone who is both relatively "hot" and apparently single and 3) why I am so bizarrely cynical about this type of crap/interaction but at any rate -- the conversation proceeded thusly:   Hot Girl: Why?  Chick: Why, what?  Hot Girl: Why only 3 days a month? {asked with the sweetest lilt I think i've ever heard. She's Mexican I think. I think that's a  Mexican  lilt...}  Chick: Oh... well... [let's all keep in mind that we're in an auditorium SURROUNDED by children and their fairly wholesome parental-types and I'm standing in the corner trying to arrange a little girl-on-girl action. Christ...] I mean, I have   really good friends   so I'm sort of  covered  as far as the whole conversation/entertainment/sympathy/diversion thing goes....  Hot Girl: So, what do you want three days a month?  Chick: ummm... well, I mean, sometimes it's just nice to get "close" to someone...  Hot Girl: {stares at me}...?  Chick: um... you know...  Hot Girl: {stares at me}??  Chick: {whispers}intimacy... you KNOW...  with  someone...   Hot Girl: {remarkably loud for such a small person}You mean Booty  calls??  Chick: {sheepishly scanning the room, smile}uh, yeah. Heh.  Hot Girl: Why can't you find anybody? You're cute.  Chick: Uh....  Hot Girl: Do you ask people?  Chick: Um....  Hot Girl: I mean, what do you do?  Chick: Uh, I dunno. I guess I just wait for someone to come along who's cute and who thinks I'm cute and who's also busy all the time and who I can have a conversation like this one with and who keeps smiling when I get to the part where I say 'I  REALLY  am only interested in 'getting together' a coupla times a month.'  Hot Girl: {nods, produces pen and scrap of paper}{smiles}Call me.   Chick:  {!!!!!} Um... O.K.  Sheesh! Of course there's no way  in hell  I'm actually picking up a phone but still...! Actually, I don't know for sure if there's no way. My initial reaction was "Oh, yeah!" quickly followed by "Yeah, right." By the time the evening began to wend down and I remembered that the whole  POINT  of the outting was to hang with  Family Guy  and his  lovely wife  (I promise I didn't know she was going to be there/nice to me/in any way receptive to my pathetic advances -- Sorry.) and I had rejoined tehm and finished with the introductions (that's right kids, she's  Boo's  Gymnastics teacher) I'd settled on "Well, it's never going to happen but it was nice acting like it  might ." But still, you really just never know once the ole hormones enter into it I'm really pretty much on autopilot....  So, there you have it folks - I pretty much  have  to call onna counta she's  Boo's coach  but do I actually ask her out in an attempt to try to get to know her incredibly flexible Capoiera toned body a little better or do I just let it ride?  I'm thinking Run and hide but I'll let  you ,  my people , cast the deciding vote....    In other news, that  mondo-huge make me or break me project  I was doing for work was presented by my fair self to the  Head Honcho  on Friday and.... [drumroll, please] she LOVED IT!! {sound of cheers, flower petals floating softly to the ground all around my modestly bowed person} She wants to show it to everybody at a  huge manager meeting  this coming   Thursday  though which opens up a whole other can of worms in terms of actually  fixing  some of the stuff I was cleverly hiding during yesterday's demo but  still , I have faith in  my team  (now reduced to one -- luckily he's the  best one ) and I am confident we shall prevail!!   {Sigh.} K. I think that's it. I'm only  really  writing right now because I have to do a  ton  of work on my  super-mondo-fantasmariffic school project  tomorrow and i want to get this out of my system so I don't spend all day tomorrow  posting  when I should be  working . Hope everyone's week-end is stellar! Chat with you all on  Monday ! [see, now I'll be embarrassed if I try to post anything before then...]

       Happy Birthday!   Today is my beautiful Professor's birthday!  Happy Birthday ,  Pof. Ketelle , you and everyone like you are what make my world livable! Give your  mom  a big squeeze for me next time you see her.    K. in a remarkably good mood right now given that I arrived at work today to find at least three MAJOR  un-finished tasks  that my boss ( El Torrito  - who is out for  four weeks  as of yesterday) didn't "have a chance to finish" and left for me to do. This is particularly funny because when I left on   Tuesdee   I specifically ASKED if she was good with everything and she said "yes". Why are people so lame? Actually, that's not true, I just had a  very cheery conversation  with a lady here at work who is soooo not lame (in fact she's so very intimidating that I can barely talk to her in spite of the fact that she's always very pleasant when we run into each other. And we  wonder  why the  Chick-ster  isn't hooking up on a more regular basis??!) Speaking of which (I'm going to go ahead and take this out of the parenthesees because I'm rambling and rambling has  no  truck with "containment") there's this girl at school (ex-school now, Whoo Hoo!) that I'm physically attracted to but who, personality-wise, irritates the hell out of me. Now don't laugh but this is somewhat unique to my experience because I usually think people are cute until I get to know them then, when they prove idiotic, they become less attractive to me. Nawattamean? This is the first demonstrable incident in a very long while (let's watch as  Chick  convieniently forgets her 20's) wherein it has been shown to me  numerous times  that this chick is annoying (not  Dirty Boy  annoying-yet-still-in-some-sick-way-fascinating, but annoying-boring) and  pedestrian  and  classist  and  smug  yet still I cannot stop staring at her ass. The girl has an amazing ass. And she's  cute . She's standing there arguing with me about how if  homeless people   really  wanted help/work/affordable housing they could find it (easily) and I'm thinking "What the hell are you talking about, you Moron! God, you're pretty!" Anyway. Last class was yesterday and she comes up and says how great it was to have me in class and how we should "keep in touch" and can she have my number -- not like that you perverts, she militantly hetero -- and we should go have coffee and I'm thinking "are you kidding??! I can't find time to hang out with people I  approve  of and you want me to hang out with your sorry ass?? mmmm.. your ass... which I guess is truthfully not all that sorry... 5-1-0...." I know. I am weak and pathetic. but seriously, before you go judging you have  got to see  this girl's butt...

       Whew!   Two down, one to go... But first, know what's the  coolest part  about assisting with the holiday dressing of  one half  of a  gorgeous couple ? The half you're  NOT  dressing may just decide to trot out her  fine ass tuxedo duds  and give you...er...ah...her wife a  little show  as well! I'm telling you folks, I didn't plan on having the  world's sexiest friends , it just kind of turned out that way!  k. so, anyway,  two papers  have been officially turned in. I spend the coming week working on  THE PROJECT  and then we are done done done until  January 16th !!!!!! I'm so excited, I may just cry...   Terror Girl  is still being mean to the  Boo . She hit her today. No worries, however,  Ms. CP  is going to go to school tomorrow and cut off her arms or something so we're all good. (See, we do agree on some stuff!)   I am sitting here watching   urlLink The OC  . Not because I want to but because I don't have a paper to work on and because I've finally discovered where  urlLink Lane 's boyfriend escaped to! See, now there's the problem. I don't need another  overwrought teen drama  a la 90210 to have to follow just because I happen to think   urlLink Adam Brody   is brillant! Gah! Kill me now! And is it  just me  or are those new  Target  ads where everything is red and kind of uber mo-dearne SCARY?? I mean seriously, everyone's all slow-mo and way too thin... Creeps me out...  And why did  Pink  stop working with  Linda Perry ? What the hell?? Ah, well, I'm not jumping off her bandwagon just yet but that girl better watch herself, nawattamsayin'?  Aaaaarrrrgggggg!!!!!! Why am I watching this???! o.k. must. stop. watching. this. crap. Ah, this is better. Some  Ice Cube  movie dubbed into Spanish --   Zona Prohibida!   {sigh} ah, well, what's one complete waste of a half hour gonna hurt?

       random conversations about girls   at the  Degas  exhibit:   Lady:  He's considered a great artist because he was so good at capturing the female form.  Lady's kid (age=10ish):  Are these real ballerinas?  Lady:  Of course not! Real ballerinas aren't that heavy....  in my livingroom:   Boo:  {watching a video; leaping around the room pretending she's Gwen Steffani, now confused because Ms. Steffani has stopped leaping and is now crouching down on the stage looking small and timid} What's she doing?  Chick:  She's being small and afraid.  Boo:  Why?  Chick:  Because the song is about how some people think girls are tiny and afraid and not very strong...  Boo:  {looking at Chick like she is  completely  making stuff up - one eyebrow raised and everything} You're kidding.  Chick:  No, really. She's acting it out.  Boo:  {quiet for a second, then commences to leaping around again} Whatever.  I'm  not afraid!   on the way to truck this morning:   Old Guy:  Hey Baby Girl!  Chick:  {looking around} Me?  Old Guy:  {nods, waves} What you know that's new?  Chick:  Not alot, actually. {Old Guy nods.} I'm "Baby Girl"? I thought my little girl was "Baby Girl"  Old Guy:  She is. You're both Baby Girls! {winks} You're never too old to be a Baby Girl...{waves one more time then shuffles away.}  Chick:  Hmmm.   on the street in front of work (no lie):   Chick:  {accosting Girl standing in front of Rite Aid with tattoo on shoulder that says "Baby Girl" in fancy script} Hey!  GSIFORAWTTSBG:  Hmmmm?  Chick:  I was JUST having a conversation with some old guy about "Baby Girl"!  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   You know her??  Chick:  Who?  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   Baby Girl.  Chick:  oh, uh no.  just... I mean I just thought it was weird cause I was just talking to this guy...   GSIFORAWTTSBG:   Oh. {Confused}  He  knows her?  Chick:  No. It's complicated actually. We were just talking about the words....  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   ...  Chick:  Baby.Girl.  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   Oh.  Chick:  Um... well, anyway. I just thought it was weird.  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   ...  Chick:  k. bye.  GSIFORAWTTSBG:   Bye.

       Holding...  Sitting here waiting for the nice people at  Network Solution s to stop whatever the  hell  it is they're doing and pay attention to me  Goddammit !! So thought I might as well check in. I Know, I've been a bit  lax  re: blog entries for my loyal/addicted/slightly stalker-esque public and for that I humbly apologize. I am at the  tail end  of my semester at school and as such have  fifty thousand  papers due so any time that can be spent typing tends to go more toward  papering  than  blogging  -  single notable exception  being yesterday whilst I was here attempting to make application stuff work but, there you have it.  Paper s will be turned in on  Tuesdee  and   Wed . respectively then fabulous " special " project needs to be completed by following  Tuesdee  then I am free, free, free! to blog, blog, blog!!! HaHaHa! eh, hem... sorry. moving on. well not really. I'm actually trying to finish up some stuff so really this is all you get for right now....  Chick =  blogtease  !

       Ha!  I'm baaaaacccccckkkkk! (I know, I already used that earlier but I'm  36  now and when a woman has reached "a certain age" she is suddenly allowed all manner of license!) So, then I am back. i had a  Fabulous  time in  New Mex ! Saw your sister,  Dirty Boy . I told her you were "awfully serious" about a  pre-med  student out here named Julie -- that you'd given her a ring and everything but she wanted to finish school first... You should probably be expecting a phone call from them...  i love my brothers so much it hurts sometimes to even continue looking at them -- yes, that's right, the Magnet family IS.THAT.COOL.  -- and I am feeling  refreshed  and  relaxed  and relatively on top of my game. Thanks for asking. Work seems to be going well (I, of course, say "seems" because  I  think I'm doing swell but I'm equally sure everyone else there is 1) wondering whether or not that "at-will" part of the hiring agreement is actually going to stand up in court and 2)  exactly  when it is that I intend to start doing all that stuff I said i knew how to do in the interviews...! No worries, though. i am reasonably certain that by the time they figure out that i am a  fraud  they will have goten so very attached to me that they simply cannot bear the thought of parting ways (not unlike an annoying puppy who shreds the furniture and takes liberties with your shoes but whom you simply cannot bear to give away!)  I am, in fact feeling so very vivacious that I find myself facing the age ole question -- what on earth do I do with the attention! not that there is that much. in fact there's really just the one. Attentive person that is. Young (and I DO mean young) lady who works at the cafe here on campus -- OH! Speaking of which, I'm a  BONEHEAD  and i forgot to "check-in" for my spring semester so i'm here on campus merrily trying to add/drop classes and the registrar tells me I've been "withdrawn" from school! Took me ten minutes of groveling and 200.00 bucks just to get him to do the amount of typing (about thirteen seconds worth) it takes to " re instate" a student...Sheesh. Sometimes i amaze even myself. Anyway... -- Cutie cafe girl is being all flirtatious and whatnot and I am being flirty back and my brain is actually saying "hmmmmmm. I wonder if this is a likely candidate for S-E-X???" {sigh} i really don't know what's wrong with me. maybe it's the spring in the air-- wait...    I just got through reading   American Gods   by  Neil Gaimon  and while I found it interesting, i have to say I probably wouldn't read it again. i felt not unlike I feel reading Armisted Maupin's more recent novels -- Interesting, somewhat compelling but in the end probably could have been said with alot fewer words. Good thing i finished it though. i just went to the bookstore and bought  $81.18  worth of   new books   that I'm supposed to be reading.... Although, I think I may try to slip in the book that  Travelin Man  loaned  me and which name escapes me... Ah, well... I'm sure those of you who  really   need to know will find a way to plumb my subconscious...   Quick super huge   Thank You!!   to the  Tall One   who lives in front of me for so fabulously stepping up to care for the wild kitties who make my front yard their home (and who i feed myself when I'm not out galavanting about the continent!)  Also a shout out to  Family Guy  for sharing the deets re: his flock o' cuties! i sure do miss having on-site persons with which to swap "and the OTHER thing she did that was sooooo cute was--" stories.  Speaking of which! You know what THE CUTEST thing ever is?? The cutest thing ever is when a couple of kids who are 5/6 get together and stare at each other so intently that  their foreheads touch ! I've seen this in action twoice now and I CANNOT even stand how adorable (in an extremely serious way, of course) it is!!!!!     You  know, I'm thinking that maybe, just possibly, the way you know you're really, seriously old is when even as you're trying to tell yourself that you COULD just flirt with a girl, possibly get to know each other a little, maybe hang out, maybe kiss - but that if you're SUPER clear about everything then if it should turn out that this girl wants more from you than you can give, you can just explaing the situation, reference the past conversations and while she might be  sad  she'd at least understand and go away... even as you're thinking that, the OTHER part of your brain -- the part that knows you're full of sh**, is already working out where  else  on campus you can go to get a decent sandwich and some fries.

       In New Mexico   FYI...  I am currently in  New Mexico  visiting my BEAUTIFUL  family ...! I am having a  wonderful  time. I got an amazing turquoise ring for my   birthday   (not to mention a day of  skiing  for me  and  my kid all expenses/lessons  paid  -- those of you who are VERY lucky may qualify to see the  Boo  skiing photos....) Anyways, I'm not officially back until Tuesday so these postings might be scare until then. Suffice to say, I LOVE my family!! They rock in sooooo many ways it is hard to even being to translate. I am blessed and lucky and fortunate. And that's all for now ... Salim, out....

       School!  Who Hoo!! First day of  school  for me (for this semester) starts TONIGHT! yay! I have soooooooo missed communing with the peeps who think about deep educational stuff n' sheet... Not that my  regular hommies  DON'T or anything {kisses! I lurv you all} -- it's just... well... i have certain  needs  that just don't get met in my everyday life -  intellectually , I mean..... eh, hem... anyways...  Just had  lunchie-poo  with the fabulous  SAH ,  El Torrito  and  Tall Guy  ... They, as a crew, are super delightful and it is always great to hear the things with your previous company are continuing to go to  hell in a handbasket ... I think though, that I might have had a slightly more  cheery  time if for our next get-together we  restrict  the gathering the  tiniest  bit more ...  K. I'm really just stalling while the  IT guys  figure out how to get me write access to some server-age which I think they may have just done, so... looks like I'm out!

       They're baaaccckkkk!  For those of you keeping track, you may have noticed a marked  LACK  as it were in the mentioning of a certain under-thirty crew and while most of you (like myself) may have cared not even a little bit about the sudden disappearance of one  Dirty Boy ,  Other Girl ,  Angel  and  Texas Guy  I'm sure their respective mothers  did  actually give half a damn and will now be relieved to hear that they have returned from the rain-soaked halls of our sister state,  Portland, Oregon ! Give it up folks! That's right, the   prodigal crew   has returned -- slightly older, not particularly wiser, but in some respects cuter ( Texas Guy's  new haircut =   tres chic !!) Welcome back, kids! I can't say I missed you but I sure as hell could use a little diversion! Ha! Just kidding. We wuv our wandering rainbow children {big squeeze!!} I would like to take a moment to point out that apparently, for no reason other than my  urlLink new job position  i am now, in their beyond all reason jaded llittle eyes "cool" ... this is only  slightly  disconcerting because it makes me really wonder what  exactly  it was that I was before. Ah, well. no worries. If I left it up to the   puppies   to define me I'd be nothing more than a leathery old Mrs. Robinson stand-in who rents out rooms on the side... Glad you're back, Children! Stick around awhile, the weather's great!  In other news, birthday bash was fabulous! So very many wonderful children types running around. it just warms the cockles to know that the Alternative set seems bent on catching up with their more "conservative" brethern in terms of sheer output! Go, us!  Let's see... what else...? Missing the  boyz  right now:   Tony  - There are some truly fab people here but as of yet none has undertaken make it thier mission to brighten my mornings with the daily drop-in (NEVER let it be said that a stop-off by an attractive and well dressed young man isn't JUST the thing to get your morning going in the right direction!)   Family Guy  - I, am Dying to know what the world's  Cutest Family  is up to!!   Sir James  - What can I say, your "serious" look kills me! I need some earnest-ness in my life. Everything here is just too damn flippant...!   Mistah Lovah-Lovah  - I actually  DON'T  miss you at all but hell, I'm making a list, right??? Kidding! Are we still going out on the 30ieth??   Kyle  - I also don't miss because I've found another cute, approximately my age, serious gay man to bond with; sorry! (Again with the kidding -- sheesh! you people cannot take a joke!)  and  Drew  - You are the standard by which I shall forever measure all men (and some women!) I want to steal you away and keep you here under my desk (not like  THAT  you perverts!!) but you'd probably get bored.... {sigh}  Anyways... I miss you all. Write and let me know how the  New Me's  doing... You had better not be hanging around her desk, you fickle bastards!!

      Oh, and a  HUGE   HAPPY BIRTHDAY  to the  L-Bean  and her  beanie-babe siblings !!!!!!!!! You all are quite possibly the best 3 & 1 year old persons I know and I'm  delighted  to be periodically invited to hang with you and your fabulous little posse (even though I  know  it's only because of my close association with a certain  Boo  -- I'm good with that! Quite frankly, I'll take what I can get...) Happy Born Day  Mama Bee  and  Mom B  for first squeezing em out then sticking around to raise em up right! You two have collectively restored my faith in the  American nuclear family unit ( -ish ) and I will always cherish you for that!  {sniff -- wipe eye}

       Yay Me!  First day   flying solo   and the  FIRST  thing I do is release the html version of the newsletter (to 12,000+ people) before everything is in place that supports it! Nice! Go, me, go me... {sigh}   Chick Magnet & Co. -  Discovering fabulous new ways to SUCK!   Anyway.  Assistant  is VERY nice and politely inquires as to whether or not I sent out the newsletter -- i respond "No, I don't think so." She (still polite as she frantically checks our listserv) replies "Uh, I think you did." Now, here, boys and girls is where she starts  seriously questioning  her continuing tenure here in  Newly-Inept-Land ! Huzzah! K. Sorry. It's just that I've been working  all day  to piece together all the random threads of my training and attempt to fix this and  just  when I got everything sort of figured out/fixed  the Webserver went down (probably something I did) bringing down not only our sites but essentially closing the retail stores as well. (I've been assured by the  IT department  here that it was in fact not  in any way  my fault but I'm sure they're just being nice.) I repeat {sigh}............

       Just a quick check in  To let you all know that I wasn't in any way  molested  last night. I chose a different (more well-lighted) path home and arrived safe and sound and slightly frisky, truth be told... K. I'm out -- this is the day the lady who's training me is   leaving   and I've already forgotten  every single thing  she told me so 1) I'm ska-rewed and 2) I want to try out some stuff before she sails off into that sunset we all like to call "abandonment"!

       Last night...  Two things happened. 1) I saw a Vampire 2) I got mugged  First, since I don't want anybody getting all  freaked out  or anything... I  did  have my money taken from me but 1) the mugger was  incredibly  polite/willing to negotiate and 2) I wasn't, in any way, hurt -- I mean, I'm a little freaked out about it (and I think I know who it was but in general there are a thousand ways it could have been much worse so there you go...)  Now then, this  Vampire  I saw: I know she was a  Vampire  because although she was not in any way "sterotypical" she was INSANELY attractive. I mean, I saw her standing waaaayyyyy at the end of the BART platform and was so completely captivated by her that I had to go hover for the rest of our trip. She had  translucent skin ,  garnet  colored  lips  and long  wavy dark hair . She was dressed in as cool a way as a  retro-type with modern influences  gal could possibly be dressed with a blood red  handbag  and  shoes . She had  shades  on at first but she took them off on the train ended up having these  CLEAR  golden eyes -- I'm telling you! She didn't smile or anything but after she figured out I was  staring  at her, she kind of did this half-grin/half-snarl thing revealing part of a set of remarkably white (remarkably  pointed ) teeth.... She also had these beautiful long, pearlescent fingernails.... Seriously, it was weird. It was weirder because I seemed to be  the only one  who even noticed her. People were moving all around her without looking at her at all.  Very odd, i tell you. Very odd indeed. Anyway....  Then, on the walk home, it was dark and I had my hood up and pretty close to where I turn off  Tele  to get to my house I noticed a long shadow moving up pretty quickly behind me (this was after I had just passed  two individuals  obviously engaged in a  drug deal  a little ways up the street) -- so this  individual  comes up and puts his hand over my mouth and says "I just want the purse, gimme the purse." I said "Can i just give you the money and keep the purse?"-- (I had to repeat myself a coupla times cause he kept saying "Don't talk, don't talk, just gimme the purse"  but finally he said "Yeah. Gimme the money." so I opened my wallet and found...  no money at all . Nice. I showed it to him and said I didn't have any money and he said "Why not?" (which truth be told, was a damn good question) and I said "I don't know." Then we both sort of stood there (and this was weird because I was thinking "Hmmm, why  don't  I have any money and what can I do to get out of this if I don't have anything to give him?" and he still kind of had his arm around me but in a very relaxed way -- I mean, neither of us was tense or anything) until I remembered that I  did  have some money in my organizer so I said "wait! i do have money!" (in a kind of bizzarrely triumphant way -- also weird in retrospect) and I found it and gave it to him. While I was looking, he took the opportunity to explain to me that he was "an addict" and he had to do this to "feed his habit." I assured him that I understood (and then, for some reason, I started to get tense, so then he got tense and I had to remind myself to relax again). I gave him the money and he said "O.K. don't turn around." and I said "o.k. i'm not turning around" and that was it. He left. i continued on my way.   Now, analysis-wise, I didn't really feel  scared  (and still don't) although I did feel really  agitated  for a few hours afterwards and I definitely have resolved to not ride BART home with  Miss Boo  anymore in the  Winter  since it's dark by the time we get to our hood-- although part of me (and maybe I'm being naive) thinks that had i had the kid with me  Mr. Drugged-Out-Criminal Man  wouldn't have picked me to rob; I dunno, I just think he'd have picked an easier target than some lady with a kid since a  mom  might  really freak out  if she thinks her kid's in danger or her kid might act unpredictably or whatever... but still no train for Me and the  Boo  at least until Daylight Savings time begins again.... and I was pretty  suspicious-acting  around the  guy-who-I-think-it-was  (just some random druggy middle aged guy who recently started hanging around our neighborhood looking sketchy) but all in all,   in the grand scheme of things   it was a fairly  polite robbery  and I got to keep all my  credit cards ,  addresses  and  photos of my kid  so I'm all good. I think. Maybe it'll sink in tonight when I'm walking home (or maybe I'll get robbed again!) and I'll wig a bit more but right now.... I think things are still fairly  rosy  in the  Chickster world .

I very much enjoyed losing all my money and I further enjoyed seeing some of the boyz from whom I've so recently separated... {sniff} I miss you guys!!

       Lest there be untold lamentations in the streets...  Seriouslyinvolved .blogspot.com is on temporary hiatus due to technical considerations beyond my control (namely that I used to write at work and what with me essentially  waiting  -- not unlike a vulture -- for the current WebChick at goodvibes to relinquish her title/position/CPU I'm not really technically  connected , if you get my drift, to any internet access type tool, PLUS I used to connect at home using my work dial-up which as been cut off so, I'm pretty much stranded in non-web land. no worries, though, i'll figure something out -- if not immediately, then by friday (webChick's last day is thursdee...) latest and the world will once again be able to know the glory that is me at my whinyest! In the meanwhile, maybe it's best if we all just take a moment to see other people and if we still feel like we need each other in our lives at the end of the week,  then  when we come back together it'll be that much more beautiful!

       Home stretch, Baby!  So, here we are. Last day after 2 years at SNIFF/5 years at The Firm. The Firm peepstook me out for drinkslas night and it was all jsu kind o  sad. Todd said he was going but then begged off at the last minute. Probably listened to all my parting comments via a tiny hold drilled in the wall separatinghis office from the conf. room we were in and got all hurt or something "What the...??! I gave that girl the best years of her life! At least she had a JOB! Especially in THIS economy..." anyway, he popped out to say he wasn't up for drinks but we should definitely get together for lunch -- which, interestingly enough, given our particular history i think might actually be fun. Once someone ceases to have absolute power over the source by which you pay rent they sort of move from annoying to just kind of silly-sad... anyway, maybe I'm just hoping for stories of all the hardships ole Todd has had to endure (and hopefully is still enduring!) that he didn't feel comfortable sharing with an employee.... Hmmmmmmm.   The boys  and I got together for  group pic  yesterday and it really hit home how very much these fellows entertain me and how enriching they've been to my existence here at  SNIFF . I'm really hoping I can figure out how to channel  SAH  and his propensity for  keeping in touch  with ex-co-workers cause, seriously, I would be just a touch sad if through my own  bizarre busy-ness , I lost track of any of my peeps here. Ah well, c'est la vie and all that. We shall see what we shall see...  In other news  BBQ  is  off  the the wilds of  Guerneville  to frolic in the sun with her  Sweetie . I would like to state for the record that I am NOT at all jealous and that I wish her all the fun/best on her trip. There. See. Not jealous at all.  I WANT TO GO TO GUERNVILLE!!!!!! WWWAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

       I'm here...  Sorry, too tired to finish the rest of that..... I was up late (for me anyway) last night watching my new favorite  urlLink show  and my old favorite  urlLink show  and then when I tried to get some sleep I was all  agitated  (I'm  "spinning"  right now -- anyone who is even  remotely familiar  with the "do-it-yerself" babymaking scene knows what THAT means) and needing to be touched and ... well... just blah... Anyways, quick update re:  Bendy Girl  -- It has henceforth been resolved that we are "just friends";  friends  who see each other very occassionally and chat on the phone when/if the mood stirkes us but  that's all ! I'm kind of relived actually. I mean it was nice to know that I am now capable of hanging out with a  female  in a  "dating" capacity  without my brain   melting   but still, it's all just soooo exhausting you know... Still and all, best thing for it, I think.  Speaking of  girls  though, got a super great  hug  from the beautiful  Security Guard  downstairs after I told her I was moving on..... Hmmmmm, kinda makes ya want to  quit stuff  more often! K. I'm outtie. At meetings/"tying things up" all day today so if you don't hear from me til tomorrow at least you know why! :-]

       Warning!   This entry may not be appropriate for the queasy of heart or for anyone who really just does not need to know "certain things" about their  good friend   Chick . If it's just too early in the morning for  shocking revelations  which may potentially put you off the  Chick-ster  for  months  if not  years  to come, skip to the second half of this post as it is about  heartfelt conversations with little ones  and NOT about  body parts .  Eh, hem, now then. Quick confession: I,  Chick Magnet , am in love with a  body part . Now, don't get me wrong, I'm  pretty attached  to the  owner of the part  as well, I mean if you were to walk up to me and say, "Chick, we're going to  take this person away  to another planet and you'll never get to see them again EVER!" I'd be pretty sad about it, but I've got to tell you here and now that if you told me  they  could stay but that this  particular Part  had to go, well.... I'd probably be  as  distraught if you catch my drift. Seriously, I cannot stop thinking about it (and the various things I want to do to it -- not all predictable things either, mind you, I'm not  just  interested in it for it's ... "it-ness"-- I want to get to know it better, sit down after a long day and have a little conversation with it, maybe a glass of wine, find out how it's day went...) anyway, I've lost my mind and am obviously sore afflicted. Still and all though, having spent the better part of the night thinking about it, I guess it's better to be in love with a peice of someone you  like  than in love with bits that are attached to someone that discusts! k. sorry. moving on...      So, yesterday the kid calls me to let me know what she's learned for me (We have this thing where since she's at school learning stuff and I'm at work  NOT  then she has to learn something for  me  everyday so I'll be able to stay on top of current events as well as continue to converse in an intelligent manner about the issues which shape her young world) so, she's telling me that today we learned about "velocity" (?? I ask you?! I didn't even  hear  that term until I saw it used prominently in an  urlLink ad campaign  late last year...) and we're chatting and from basically out of nowhere she says "Mom? Is it hard being a mom?"  And I didn't know what to say. I mean I  actually  said "Sometimes. But lots of things that are really amazing are hard." Which seemed to adequately address that particular query because then we started talking about the storm that was suposed to hit on  Tuesdsay  (today) but it made me think. I mean, if I  really  think about it, I don't think being a mom to  Boo  is all that hard. I  do  think it's hard trying to stop every annoying person in the world from trying to mess with my kid's outlook on life; i think it's hard that I've tended to have to justify my particular flavor of mom-ness to complete strangers from a whole subset of various angles; I think it's hard to love someone sooooo very much while at the same time being made constantly aware that that's not going to be enough to stop all the bad/annoying/oogey things from happening but really, none of that has to do with  Boo  as a person. Parenting her is not hard. Life is.  Boo  makes it easy to see why it's a good thing that I'm here and there's just not alot in the world that does that... Anyway. Just something I was thinking about last night. When I wasn't thinking about " the Part "

       Howdy!  Well, hello there folks. I have not written today onna counta I am tired and  SWAMPED  alla pona sudden here at work (I was just introduced to the  New Me  who I will be spending my remaining time here at  SNIFF  training to do a job I've held for all of  3 months ... anyway, she's cute. Kind of "fresh out of Business school" but cool enough seeming. What is it about finding out that you've been replaced with someone who is essentially your  opposite  in every way, shape and form that is so very unnerving?? Ah well. It would be folly to expect anyone to come up with a one-to-one exact copy of anyone so complex as the  Chick  so I'm just going to attempt not thinking about it and see where that gets me!) Week-end was FAB-ulous.  Pretty Boy  pretty much rocks my world which is neat and cool (and just a little anxiety-producing but whatever...) Got to hang with the child a LOT which was also neat. We went out into the   Rainstorm from Hell   the other day and felt quite  small  and  tossed about  for about half an hour. Then I dropped her with the  CP  and me and  Miss Tail  hooked up for some quality hang-age with her most fabulous pup  Isabel  -- we heart her ( MT  - not Izz - although we do love the  Izz  an awful lot!) because she is going to teach me how to   cook   this year (It's my only  actual resolution  so it just may happen) ... We've agreed that I will learn to cook  one dish  a month; that that dish will not involve anything "seasonal"; that it will contain no less than 60% ingredients that have a shelf-life of forever and that it can be fully prepared in under 20 minutes! In return I'm going to "help her adjust her life attitude." Just between you and me, I think i have the easier part of the bargain!   O.K. I'm really just checking in with ya'all before heading on out so, more tomorrow maybe, if I can get away from my  Shadow ...  Oh, but wait, my  Lovah-Lovah  is back from  Mad-Cow Land  (Canada) which is  great  as he was very much missed! He's all excited about  my new  urlLink job   because he thinks that this somehow means he has greater access to cute nekkid chicks. I'm trying to 'splain to him that "No, *I* am the only one who gets access to cute nekkid chicks!" but he's just not hearing it right now... Ah, well... somethings you've just got to learn the hard way...

       Brillant!    urlLink The girl I like   sent me a  CD  with two  performance pieces  on it that she did (cello-brillant!) and that she's sending off into the world in hopes of  winning much acclaim  (which, had I even the  slightest bit  of anything to do with it, she most certainly would --   in spades  !) ... She sent it awhile ago but I've not been able to actually remember to listen to it at a point in time when it was in the  same city  as my ears so I've  just  (this morning) popped it in and  my gawd , it is just so very beautifully done! Apparently what I'm listening to are "the first two movements of the  Shostakovich cello concerto " -- the first is really quite moving (there's a bit in the middle that  kills  me) but the  second ... sheesh! I am  in no way qualified  to judge these things but it's just really amazing is all. All  tragic  and sad but beautiful nontheless... Anyway, Thanks  GIL  for the CD! I'm going to listen to it  non-stop  until it becomes a a  permanent part  of my  brain's background noise  then maybe I'll go watch  Grease 2  again to round it all out!

       And HERE we are!!  Well, it looks like we all made it ( gross assumption  on my part as I've been in bed all day -- i.e.  not  calling up my chums to see if anyone got shot... still though, I will believe everyone is just fine until i hear otherwise, dammit! Our  Chick  is nothing if not  an optimist !!)   First and foremost, super huge   thanks/shout-out   to my  Best Buddy Q  and her  lovely other half  for inviting the  troops  to thier digs for a glorious  New Year's Eve   gathering of the babies ! I am ever amazed that we all managed to have such   completely gorgeous offspring   and having everyone together like that just feels so desparately  extended-family -like and  warm--gushy  that, well, it brings a  tiny tear  to this salty old  Chick's  eye! I heart you guys sooo much! I swear I have  the  best  bunch of buddies  a gal could hope to have! {love!}  Right. Moving on. As we all know it is now  January . There are some   crucial birthdays   in January --  Martin Luther King Jr. , my  mom , my  gramma , the illustrious  Miss Tail , the fabulous  Miss L-bean ,   ME  !!! Now I know what you're all thinking: "Eek! I've only  22 shopping days  left to find something   appropriately fantastic   with which to celebrate the fact that our own beloved  Chick  has somehow managed to hold off the  marauding hordes  for the last  36 years  and shows no signs of weakening!" There there. I  beg  of you,  please  do NOT  panic . I  know  the  impulse  will, of course, be to buy me something  urlLink expensive  but I  must  caution against  giving in to the temptation  because then I would feel like I  owe  you (  sexually  , I mean) and nobody wants that! So, then, what's a  poor pal  who just wants to show  Chick  how very much she's worth in terms of  cold, hard cash  to their otherwise  colorless/lackluster lives  to do?? Glad you asked! May I direct your attention to the  urlLink link  at the right, namely the "Get on my good side" one that takes you to my  Amazon wish list ...  anyways, really just making conversation, I, of course, expect  nothing more  from my friends than   absolute fealty   and   occassional kisses  , oh, and   chocolate  ! Lots of  chocolate !   Speaking of which, I'm awfully  excited  right this second (in a lying around in bed kind of way) because the fabulous  Pretty Boy  has suggested that we take a drive over to the  rich side of the Bay  tomorrow after work and act like we belong there! I am not  just  delighted with this suggestion because it means adding to the hours I've clocked driving around in a super cool little car with white racing stripes but also because it's just such a sweet thing to do -- go off for a little put around places where even the  homeless people  wear  linen ; maybe have a little  sup-sup  somewhere where each and every portion is carefully crafted from totally organic, cruelty free, adult animals who've already lived a long and productive life and have actually signed waivers attesting to thier desire to now re-join that oh-so-glorious cycle of life that includes my-omnivoristic-self and a little light sauce; possibly ending with a  casual stroll  round some incredibly  clean pier  with a bunch of "really very well perserved"  Marin  types.... i dunno, just sounds cute is all.  And I'll bet you there will be  chocolate  involved! If there is a god (and I  know  there is) I fail to see how there could not be...!

       I think I may start bleeding from the eyes   So, here at my new job it is my joy/curse to see a variety of  wannabe products  that would like pride of place on our  hallowed shelves . Regardless of what your average layman (get it? Lay-man! Heh heh...) might suppose, the buyers  urlLink here  do actually take their jobs seriously and as such there is a need for a space here in the office which we like to call "the reject pile."  Two minutes ago , my  lovely assistant  walked up to my desk and presented me with a product from that alleged pile which I would  LOVE  to share with  you , my readership, but which, sadly is apparently a "demo" version and which I'm just not finding using one of the many fine  urlLink search engine's  out there. In my search for the "  Mini  Pierced Be-Atch! " however, I did run across these:   urlLink http://naughtynovelty.zoovy.com/product/LT113133     urlLink http://familyevolutions.com/shopping/?linkpage=indexf2.cfm?Cat=%3Cfont%20color%3DF4F4F7%3E2%3C%2Ffont%3EBaubles   Why, oh why??

       Just real quick...  I.LOVE.MY.KID    VM message from my child left last night whilst I was sitting in my public policy class wondering what the hell the point was to doing anything EVER:     Boo:  Hi Mommy! I just wanted to say -- gahhack! No, wait, GAHHACK??! That's not what I wanted to say! I was chewing [giggle - then suddenly serious] um... what I wanted tosay was that I miss you and i love you and I ah -ppreciate you coming to school this morning and giving me a kiss and... let's see... that I love you ... wait, I already said that. well I do. K. Well. I'm going to go.  kisses, kisses, kisses, mwah!, mwah! mwah! [click]  !!!!! I KNOW!!!  I also love  Prof. Ketelle . It's hard to say  exactly  why I love her -- a close personal friend of mine who knows  NOTHING  about how I actually am and who will be turning TWELVE in March yet still somehow thinks he's qualified to speak on such issues, posits the theory that I want to  be  her and, as is my want, I'm translating that into a desire to  have  her. He is nuts.  Prof. K.  is cute!  Further on that note, if anyone knows a woman named  Karina Moreno  who works for the  urlLink Children's Defense Fund  and who can get me a   date   with her I would be eternally grateful (and there might even be a little  cash  in it for you as well!!) She is beautiful and brillant and, yes, I do want to be her but I also very much want to DO her so do let me know...

However, you have many quirks which can either win people over or completely annoy them. But you're a sweetheart through and through, and it's hard not to love you.        Take The Johnny Depp Quiz!        which I think is pretty accurate so...

       Rendered stupid  I am 36 years old. I am secure in my adorableness, smart, happily single, primary breadwinner for me, my cats and most of my daughter. I have a great home, a fantastic job and a way with words that dumbfounds 73% of the voting population. Why then is it that upon meeting the shockingly charismatic man that my psychotic aquaintance (mom of kid in Miss Boo's class) is seeing for the second time I am rendered dumb.   Second question. Why is a man who is warm, intelligent,  Italian , committed to his daughter and obviously enamoured with children of all stripes not too mention insanely attractive dating a crazy person? That's it really. My musing for the day. Why am I such an idiot loser that all I can think to say to the beautiful man smiling at me and warmly pressing my hand between the two of his is: "Nice to meet you... [then, realizing we've met before and engaged in an extended conversation] uh...  AGAIN !" Dur...!  What  is wrong with me?

       And the Award goes to....!  That's right folks, the awards season is upon us and in the spirit of this inanity I'd like to take a moment here and there to offer my own props to people who've maybe not accomplished a whole lot, possibly arent' the most well known, hell, who even I can't stand sometimes but who, in thier tiny, some might say mostly insignificant ways have made an impression on me lately. And so, without further ado, here they are!   The award for:    Best thing ever to shout out in a gym at your best friend who's calling you a wuss just because you thought a "push-up" was a tasty ice cream treat:    "Dammit Man, lay off! I can't help it if I fucked your girlfriend last week, but she was all over me from all those drugs you keep lying all over your place!!"  -- courtesy of   urlLink Mr. L-L   God-Uncle Extraordinaire and former friend    Fine-est freaking Cat doctor I think I've ever met  (and believe you me, I've been a cat owner for awhile now!  note: see how graciously I avoided the "pussy" jokes? This is a  classy  awards show!)   Ms. Noel Grandrath, DVM  at  urlLink VCA Bay Area Animal Hospital  we love you, Man! er...ah... woman ! Kinda makes you wish you had hypochondriac cats(!!) anyway, moving on...    Best Seduction Line I've heard this week:    "Is  DB  here? No? Can I stay here tonight then?" [obviously, the offers for quality lovin' are  not  tumbling in right now....]    Best brush-off by a family member:     Little Brother:  Hey, can I call you back?  Big Sis:  Sure, when?  Little Brother:  Um. Just... you know... whenever.    Best inadvertant yet still fairly crushing insult from really hot co-worker who's standing directly in front of your desk as you sit there trying to work:    "Damn. Not a single person who I  want  to talk to is at their desk!"  Kay. That's it for now. I'm sure as the day progresses more of this kind of silly crap will make itself known to me and if you're veeerrrrryyyy lucky, maybe, just maybe, I'll put it up here for you to share!

       Pretty, Pretty, Pretty!   Today is a  very, pretty, day .  Three pretty things I noticed within the first three minutes of me stepping out of my front door:  1) The plum tree in the front yard is covered with little white flowers  2) The light/air out there is freaking amazing -- I {heart} pre-storm light  3) There was an older Af. Am gentleman out walking a small, blond dog with the  coolest  russet colored velour  urlLink fedora  (note:  urlLink here's a site  I ran across looking for the appropriate hat link. V. Hilarious.)

       Congratulations!  By now you all may have heard the  SF  is handing out  urlLink marriage licenses  at the drop of a "all-you-have-to-do-is-stand-in-line-for-a-million-hours-in-the-rain-and-do-some-paperwork" hat and I am  super proud  and  delighted  to announce that the  fabulous ,  wonderful , and  oh-so-deserving    Misses Bs  managed to obtain one of those "only handing out 400/day", "official/legal for now anyway" documents !! Yay! This will make the SECOND marriage between those two that I failed to be on hand for and I've just got to say I hope I'm around in  forty years  when you guys  renew your vows , although, truth be told, I'll probably miss that too -- I'll send something nice from  Guam , though!  In other news, this week-end was a little weird but fine in general. I had invited a  classmate/friend  of the  Boo's  over for a sleepover Friday night (so her mom could  get busy  with some guy she met whilst on vacation in  Mexico  -- I actually met him on Sat. He seemed like quite a nice person. Too bad he's getting involved with a  FREAK ! Anyway, more on that later maybe...) Thing is,  Boo  and this person have a  very strange relationship in that while this child can't seem to stay away from the  Boo , she spends the majority of her time being mean to her. Now, given that her mom is a  head-case , I think it's fairly likely that she's just mean to everybody -- what was weird though was that the few times she  wasn't  being mean, when she was  actually being nice ,  Boo  was mean to her! I know!! My Boo! My  sweetheart Angel-girl  with nary a mean word to say to anybody was  actively mean  to this kid. Something to see, let me tell ya! So. I spent a whole bunch of time being "disappointed" with the two of them which is never fun and which led to some tears and overall unhappiness -- cute though, late Saturday after little  Miss Demonchild  had gone home, I went in to check up on my  suddenly very quiet  kid and it turns out she had put  herself  on timeout because, obviously I wasn't going to get around to doing it... (I was feeling bad about the whole situation since I  was  the one who invited her and I know for a fact that this kid is a terror...) because, seriously, a kid's got to have some  freaking    structure  ! I mean you can't tell a kid she's been disappointing all day and then not do anything about it! I swear, it is a damn good thing  Boo's  around to school me on this stuff... otherwise God only knows how she'd get raised! So... anyway. much of the week-end was spent with us being distant and moody which SUCKED but we're good now. I have her here with me until noon so at least I get a little quality Boo time to make up for the at-odds-ness (anybody else sensing what a  complete wreck  I'm going to be when she's twelve and doesn't talk to me for three days in a row.) Yesterday I spent reading and writing a "legal brief" for my  public policy  class ... I'm still trying to catch up with the onslaught of reading my  Prof  gave at the beginning of the semester --  why  do professors assign you  fifteen thousand pages  of reading before anyone who isn't actually  in  publishing has had a chance to buy the damn books??? Anyway...  OH! Almost forgot, I've had  several requests  lately for new aliases -- Let's see,  Ms. B .... There are not a lot of names I can think of for you that aren't going to get me in trouble  but  I was just reading " urlLink An Ideal Husband "  by  Mr. Oscar Wilde  (I know, I know...THIS is why I don't get my reading on public policy done! O.K. moving on...) which nicely supports given the events of the past week-end but then, at the same time, I'm also realizing what a  kick-ass administrator  my cute little married friend actually is (and NO I am  NOT  just saying that because she happens to be my boss! {offended by the very suggestion} )So, in light of all of this, I'm thinking the new name for  Ms. B  is going to be  Ideal Husband/Our Esteemed Leader  or " IHOEL " which I like very much and which sounds vaguely Jewish or maybe Hawaiian.... Anyway, there you have it.  Other Girl  has also put in a request to change her monniker to "Other Woman" or "Other Lady" or something like that to which I must reply "Uh, yeah, talk to me   ten years   from now and I'll think about it."  Denied!  Alrighty, then. That's it for now, I believe. Hope your respective week-ends were FAB! talk attcha all later!

       Hating the Game...  First let me say that this is NOT going to be yet another  rant  by yet another  single person  against the forced "lovey-wuvey-ness" of the upcoming  V-D extravaganza . I think Valentine's Day can be very nice and special and if you have someone to go play/celebrate with more power to ya!  That said, what the Hell??! Have we all gone insane? I mean, I have no problem with the idea that it's a nice idea to celebrate the fact that you love someone -- I, myself, am ALL about the love -- but my god, I really think the  rules/expectations/guilt/stress/MONEY  aspect of the whole damn thing are really getting out of hand. Case in point:   Note to parents  from my kid's school (not  official  note, just friendly reminder from "Concerned parent"): "This Valentine's Day please remember that if your child is going to bring a valentine for a friend, he/she should provide valentines for  all  the children in his/her class rather than singling out a select few. This will prevent any particular child's feelings being hurt and will contribute to the cohesiveness of the group."   Ummmm. My child plays with   three   kids in her class. She has "crushes" on   two   others. She has   two   best friends (neither of whom is in her current class). Sometimes she really likes   one   particular child and sometimes I  force  her to play with another little girl whom she quite honestly has no use for but she plays with her anyway because she loves me. From what I've seen my child is not all that different from  every other kid  in her class. If my little girl did not receive a Valentine from one of the   18   other children in her class with whom she is friendly but feels no special attachment, I'm thinking, really, honestly, that there would be no skin lost off her back -- that is unless she was  informed  that it was the   norm   for  everyone  to give  everyone  Valentines. THEN were she not to get one,  then  she might notice and/or feel a little bad about it. Look, people, all I'm saying is there  will come a time  when my  Boo  doesn't get a Valentine from  every single person she knows . When this time comes, I, for one, would much rather she had learned that it's  no big deal  starting at age six; than learn instead to expect something that will probably cease to happen as she approaches older kid/grown-up-ness. Just my personal thoughts. I'd love to hear what other people think about this. Really I would.  Next, I heard this on the radio today:    Boy voice:  Happy Valentine's Day Honey!  Girl voice:  [sounding angry] All you got me is a card??!  Girl voice:  [Having opened card and discovered gift certificate for something - now sounding happy] Oh, my goodness, a $75.00  urlLink gift certificate ! Oh, honey, I love it! Thank you!  K. Is it just me or would anyone else  snatch that damn card  right out of that   chick's whiny, ingrate, grasping little fingers   and start packing the  U-Haul . I mean seriously. Where the hell do people learn that not only should they  expect  something each and every  Valentine's Day  that is "significant" (e.g.   expensive   and/or different from the affection you get the rest of the year) and that they not only get to be  disappointed  if it doesn't happen but that they also get to be  pissed off   if they feel it's not enough of those things??! Hmmmmm. Could it possibly be something they learned IN THE FIRST GRADE!! I dunno. I'm really just asking...

       So, tired right now...  Luckily, I have  no  appointments tonight and as such will be crawling into bed circa   8:30-9:00ish   and drifting off into that sweet land of the  delicate repose  for a nice... long... uninterrupted... sleep-session. Maybe. We'll see.  Coupla of cool things: heard from the fabulous  Tony  yesterday and have made plans to meet up for some  lunchy-lunch  which is just GREAT since it's been  sixteen years  since i've seen him and his snazzy outfits so obviously it is about freaking time!  New Job check in: Still seems to be going well. I, for one, am particularly happy. I've got big ( huge ) plans for  development  which seem to be proceeding at a  decent clip  so that's all good. Noone here has started  yelling  at me yet (in fact, the level of  overall nice-ness  in this place is practically "Stepford" in it's  sincerity  and  effusion  ... is that a word? "Effusion?" If so, is it a  dirty  word??) Anyway, I'm happy and content and still feeling slighty overwhelmed but at least at this point its my own damn fault  -- meaning that all this  stuff  I have to do is stuff I dreamed up so I can't really blame anybody but myself. I may try to though. Stay tuned...  Speaking of which, my  VCR  is inexplicable to me. As we may remember,  Traveling Man  was so good as to show me how to set the damn thing, which I  did  and which has yet to actually start recording at  any  of the times I  programmed  it to record. I have no idea what's its deal is but if anyone out there is currently compiling copies of  Gilmore Girls  and/or  One Tree Hill  and wouldn't mind sharing them with me I'd much appreciate it. You don't know what it's like to sit in your  public policy class  alternnately wondering if 1) the reason for the current decline in California schooling can be directly traced to the passage of Prop 13 and 2) Whether or not Rory is ever going to hook up with "naked Guy" at Yale! It's nerve racking I tell you!!  Anyway. I'm going to go find food now. more later, if I get inspired but probably not.

       It's all about the hair  Well, hello kids! How the heck are we this fine afternoon? Me? Why I'm  great  actually thanks for asking! So, weekend was very fun. Squired the famous  Miss Tail  and her   new haircut   around  Friday  eve ( urlLink karaoke , drinking -- probably best that I've forgotten most of it!) met up with the ever-lovely  Missy Sue  and  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  as well and proceeded to have an FAB-ulous time.  Mr. L-L  did eventually desert me but no worries!  Three seconds  before he   wussed   out of my life a very nice young lady who went by the monniker of  Ming  and who was "visiting with a friend" took up residence near my chair so I was able to replace him pretty much immediately in terms of having someone  tall , and  fascinating  to chat with as the night drew to a close. Plus, her hair was  much  better! At any rate.  Mr. L-L  made it up the next day by bringing me and my kid  junk food  right before her class started (only to then proceed to  lecture   me  on proper nutrition vis a vis offspring -- this while he's shoving a  Big mac  down his throat...! I know!! Damn good thing I {heart} him otherwise I know a certain curb with his name on it!!)   Sat., following the  Boo  class we absconded with a friend of hers and finished out the eve with the ever fun  playdate/sleepover ! You all wish you were me and my life right now, don't think I can't feel it!   Sunday  I managed to persuade  Pretty Boy  to go driving about (not difficult given the weather, his shiny still-newish car and the  urlLink super-low rockstar jeans  i just got last week!). I don't want to make anyone  too  jealous (too late!) so let's really just say  Presidios  were circumvented,  Golden Gate bridges  were viewed and much (emphasis on  much ) fun was had by all -- well at least by the two of us. I'm pretty sure the  middle-age golfer guys  may have had a moment or two where the fact that they were  miles  away from being as   good-looking/fabulous/kicking-it-in-a-mini   as the two of us came crashing into their conciousness like an errant golfball through the clubhouse window but whatever. It is not my job to make sure  EVERYONE  feel attractive/desirable/necessary! Sheesh!  Then , after the frivolities were mostly over, I ran into an old friend of mine who is now waitressing at this  urlLink place  we always go to eat. She holds claim to being one of the  single most beautiful girls  I have ever met in my life and I haven't seen her in awhile. We exchanged info though so maybe I will attempt to restart what little friendship there actually was at the time and see if it can be expanded upon. Probably not though. I'm pretty satiated right now, plus I have TONS of reading to do for class! Anyways... week-end was great as always. I'm starting to feel things slip into a kind of a pattern and I'm realizing (well, at least  admitting ) that everything is at a great point of "set-ness" and that all I really need to do right now is maintain... which... I think... barring any unforseen   drama   i may be able to do. {fingers crossed} maybe...

       Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts  WASHINGTON, DC—In a move designed to make the United States seem more "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy-metal manner," Congress passed a bill Monday changing the nation's name to the Ünited Stätes of Ämerica. "Much like Mötley Crüe and Motörhead, the Ünited Stätes is not to be messed with," said Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK). An upcoming redesign of the Ämerican flag will feature the new name in burnished silver wrought in a jagged, gothic font and bolted to a black background. A new national anthem is also in the works, to be written by composer Glenn Danzig and tentatively titled "Howl Of The She-Demon."   Ha! Sorry, back to work now...

       Man Finds Self Back At Porn Store Again   "JASPER, WY—Gregory Steevers, 37, found himself standing in the aisles of the Pleasure Island adult bookstore again Monday. "I was out on a walk after I dropped off the electric bill," Steevers said. "I stopped and had a sandwich, then, before I knew it, I was perusing the shelf of anal videos at the Island. Weird." Steevers said he's "ended up" at Pleasure Island about twice a week for the past four years."  O.K. so  urlLink The Onion  is always funny but this week it is seriously killing me...

       My Hero!   So, last night, we were treated to a FABulous B-day celebratory dinner by the wonderful and currently, indispensible  Travelin' Man . Din was GREAT. We went to   urlLink Emmy's Spaghetti Shack   and, seriously, with the word "shack" in the title you KNOW it's allll gooood...!  THEN , as if the lovely food/company weren't simply enough,  Mr. Man  proceeded to figure out how to set my VCR to record  every Tuesday night  so that I am now free to go to my  public policy class  without having to think "Crap! I'm going to miss my  favorite show  in the world AGAIN!!" For this we are grateful. Thank you  TM ! You are stellar and more than half of the "cream in my coffee"!  In other news, I'm expecting a  wee one  here any minute. My  Boo  is sick and the  CP  will be dropping her by so that she can be small and sniffley here with me until I get some stuff done, then I will take her home and snuggle her up and give her lots of toasty good lovin' so that she feels better tomorrow and ready to face the ratrace that is first grade!! In fact, I think they're here so I'm out...

       msut be all the sugar!   First, let me state, for the record, that my  Best Buddy Q  is  always  right. At least when it comes to telling me what to do about MY life that is. I mean, she may be a bit MEAN about it sometimes (borderline  abusive , really) but in general I find that the more I listen to her the more likely it is that i get what I want... hmmmm.... There's a connection there that I really MUST explore further someday. Anyways. Had some awfully (in my opinion) productive/edifying meetings today so while I didn't actually get some stuff worked on that really needs to be worked, i  did  get some stuff figured out in terms of "the big picture" which can't be all bad.   Had a very funny check-in last night as well from the awfully cute  Dirty Boy  (who is claiming to  hate  me due to some  minor prank  I may or may not have pulled whilst I was spending time with his  family of origin  in  New Mexico ) -- seems he got a call from his   Mom   which went something like this:   DB:  Hello?  DBM:  Hello, Sweetheart  DB:  Oh, hey mom. What's up.  DBM:  Oh nothing. I'm just wondering how YOU are???? (pregnant pause which may or may not have something to do with the fact that I  might  have told them he was engaged to a  skinny, blonde, law student ...)  Hee Hee! I love having friends to mess with!  Speaking of which, in about 17 minutes, I will be leaving the premises to go have a celebratory din-din with the ever-fabulous  Travelin' Man  (I  think  we're still celebrating my birthday but seriously, at this point, so long as the food is free and the company is fun, I'll celebrate just about anything!)

       This morning I am at a loss...   Several key things are happening right now that perhaps you, my reading audience, can assist with.   1) There's this  guy ... Ha, just kidding. Well, not really because there  is  this guy... O.K. thing is there's this boy and he's my friend and we like each other and stuff  but the last coupla times I tried to force him to hang out with me he was awfully sweet and everything but he also had "other plans". So, here I am with a sudden  window  as it were about to open in my (I think already quite well established   extremely   packed) schedule and I want to find him but I also REALLY don't know if I can handle the (again really very nice) rejection. I mean, i  could   use my evening in some other productive manner e.g. getting some  sleep   or going out with some other friends or whatever... thing is... I kinda... well. The thing is, I want to get l.a.i.d! That's right people, the  Chickster  wants to get touched in a way that is considered by most to be inappropriate workplace behavior.... {sigh} Oh, well. P'raps I will just  not do anything  and see what happens. Actually, now that i REALLY think about it, a decent night's sleep does seem pretty  sexy  ...   2) I just had  M&M s for breakfast. Not sure if that's good or bad; just thought I'd put it out there.  3)  I have been offered a ticket to the   urlLink Melissa Etheridge   concert at the  Filmore  on Monday night (thank you  OT  and thank your  Pops  for the hook-up) but, were i to accept it would, in effect, mean that I was going to the concert with my child-friend's  Dad  which just seems REALLY wierd to me! especially since the child in question is always hitting on me! ( DB  could you  try  to control/satisfy your woman??!)... anyways, as with everything else in my life, I will definitely think about it but..... [Those of you who are  paying attention  may note that upon a similar occassion I accepted a ticket to watch  Mr. Lyle Lovett  playing at the  Paramount  from this self-same musically aware duo without even the SLIGHTEST hesitation and I would JUST like to say, in my defense, I didn't  know  where that ticket came from and even if I  had  -- c'mon! it's  Lyle  fer Chrissakes!!]  Anyway, my fingers are frozen and I think my files are through downloading so I'll be off for now... ta!

       Three things...  Real quick, three things I've been thinking about lately (o.k. on my drive into work this morning -- I am nothing if not topical!)  1) I had one of THOSE dreams last night about an ex-co-worker Boy- friend  of mine last night (I actually have had many dreams that I've been remembering lately. I kinda think it's because I've been being woken up  smack  in the middle of them the last few days so they're being  seared  into my conscious mind... anyway...) and the funny thing is that he's not (by a long shot) the one one would THINK that I'd have that sort of dream about if ya knawhattamean. I mean, no disrespect or anything, he's absolutely  stellar/attractive/gainfully employed  etc. Just not really my typical  type . Dream was nice though. We both seemed to be having a pretty good time so it's all good.   2) I  love  my kid's teacher. There are a bunch of reasons why this is the case but the most recent happens to be that she cares  not even a little bit  about  dumb stuff like TARDINESS in the first freakin' grade. I mean maybe she WOULD if we were always late or something but for the occassional "got stuck on the bridge" nonsense she's pretty cool. I know this because we were late this morning and we had to go to the office and get a tardy slip/"tut-tut, I am just amazed that SOME parents have such a hard time getting their children to school on time!" speech from the school secretary who is in charge of filling out those slips of paper -- said  entirely  for my benefit, I'm sure -- so we got our slip and slunk into  Miss Boo Teacher's  class and were greeted with "Hello! Got caught in the rain? You can put that right there, Hon." Paired with a cheery smile/finger indicating we should put that tardy slip  directly  into the  garbage bin  so she wouldn't have to do it...  Miss Boo Teacher =cool.  3)  Reverse psychology  doesn't work on my kid.  Boo  gets to sleep in my bed with me on  Thursdays . She would very much like to sleep with me more often but for some reason (which I'm not even super clear about) she's not allowed to. There's some rule that I'm vaguely certain the  CP  and I set up along time ago that I'm sure could use some  re-visiting  but I haven't got the  energy  to really do the research on it -- not unlike the  sodomy laws  in some states. Anyway, the other night, or rather morning ( 4am ) kid has a  bad dream  and instead of calling out to her "Well, try to go back to sleep and we'll talk about it in the morning." followed by an hour of  sniffling ,  half-sleep  and  calling out for assurance  that those monsters had not only been been escorted OFF the premises they'd actually, in fact been  shot  and had their  bloody carcasses  put up on display in an area where the  Boo  could see them easily from her top bunk -- I elected instead to just go get in bed with her so we could both just freaking get some sleep. So, when she wakes up in the morning and discovers me there she inquires whether or not I had a good sleep. I reply "yes!" and go on and on about how much I like her bed. Then for added measure I say "I want to sleep with you ALL the time [this being where the reverse psychology comes in because that's what  she  says to  me  and this way, theorhetically, she gets a chance to tell me "no" which is  empowering  to her while at the same time supports  my  position in the matter] and she says "O.K.! If you really want to you can." {sigh}  Who  decided I should be allowed to parent??!

       Love and Light  Welcome to the happy, joyous, love and light world of  Miss Chick Magnet . Come in. Sit on down. Put your feet up. Enjoy the satisfaction and joie de vivre that is a happy, contented Chick... mmmmmm... bask in the glow.... Feel the warmth.... Now get out!  Ha. I am in a good mood today. This is due to several factors which I will detail in the order in which they occur to me.  1) Kid was with me ALL Day at work yesterday which, for those of you unfamiliar with the joy that is the  Boo  was  GREAT ! I love having her near me. i love that we went off to go meet the  urlLink God-Uncle-Peep  for lunch and had the following conversation:   Boo:  The rest of the class is going to  Yerba Buena  park today [not her literal class, but the group she was with yesterday during her  other  official day off from school].  Chick:  Do you wish you could go?  Boo:  Yes. but no. I mean, I like it but I like going to your work and seeing my grown-up friends more. And you. I like being with you.  Chick:  {melting into large puddle of goo} Cool. I like you too.  Boo:  I know.  2)  Professor K.  loves me and sooo has my back. Finished overdue paper (finally -- one down six to go!) which I was in the process  of surreptitiously trying to slip onto  Other Professor's  pile when  Other Professor  notices me and smiles largely.  Not  the response I was expecting since I've been nothing but a  Major  f***up in her class thus far. As class progresses, I notice that she's being awfully nice to me an awful lot.   [to guest speaker] "You probably know  Chick , it seems you two have a lot in common." " Chick , maybe you can help  A.  figure out a topic for her final paper?" "See you next week! {Said in singsongey voice combined with a jaunty wave}" so I am perplexed and leaving class and run into Beautiful, Brillant  Prof. K.  and she says "Hey, you! I was thinking about you this week. I thought of something you could do as your final project for  Other Professor's  class that ties into your job and I discussed it with her and she thought it was a great idea! She's very excited about it!" I. Love. Prof. Ketelle.  3) For some bizarre reason things vis a vis the  sheer amount of paper-writing  that has to happen in order for me to not completely fail this semester don't seem that insurmountable today. Probably won't last but nice right this second.  4) Having lunch with my  BBQ  tomorrow. which is  Great ! Because I miss her (even though i  technically  saw her -- and her Bee-u-ti-ful offspring -- three days ago)  So, all-in-all, I'd have to say, sum total i'm happy. today. Hurry in, People, Get it while it lasts! Cause when it's gone, it's goooone! Well, no, probably not, but you get my drift.

       You know what's sexy?  This phrase:   "drop the hammer on the next bitch you nail!!"   You know what else is sexy? Spelling   "creditt!!"   with two "t"s....  Spam  -- it's not just a godsend, it's a way of life!  Sigh. I have too much to do.  April  hasn't even started yet and I'm already behind. Help!

       Me time...  Gawd, I'm tired! I stayed home  sick  yesterday to try to relax and ended up just getting more freaked out about the fact that I have  fifty-billion  papers due over the course of the next month... arrrrrrgggggg! At any rate. My "department" here at work appears to be growing which is nice because now it means that i have  ALL  the really talented "making-the-web-stuff-run" peeps under me -- Hahahaha!!! The sheer power!!!! er...ah...eh, hem... sorry.  Wek-end promises to be good. Hopefully, I will freaking get  some  of these papers done before it is over. Maybe. My brain has shut down for the evening so I don't really know that I'll accomplish anything beyond picking my nose and worrying some more but, who knows....  Played poker on Wed. eve with da Crew and while I did not win I also did not lose so... feeling pretty good about my place in the annals of poker-dom (Tee Hee, I said "annals"!) I'm thinking of  changing  Mistah Lovah-Lovah 's  nom du blog  to " All In/All Out! "  Taht's it. I'm exhausted. Everyone have a glorious week-end!

      I just got totally strong-armed by two tall, nordic, impossibly thin, extremely serious teller ladies at the bank I go to. I gave the one my  paycheck  and asked to get some money back (a  miniscule  amount which was MORE than covered by the amount I already had in my account) and she did that serious, no-making-eye-contact, undertone thing where she says "Just a moment" and rings for "customer service" -- who was conicidentally  another Swedish-looking chick  with the same  vaugely European  but still hard to place acccent (they're probably  both  from  Des Moines ) and who walks (glides) over and tells me in a v. concerned voice that I should have  direct deposit . Now, I've got nothing against  Direct Deposit  and to tell the truth I kind of prefer it but seriously it was like the fate of the free world was at stake here.... Or maybe they just really want me to  never  come into thier bank again. I probably make the place look tired. Weird. Anyway, there is a tiny round  picture  of me in the street version of the   urlLink Bay Guardian  . I am apparently "sex-positive." Nice to know. I wonder if that's  code  for "Never going to get laid again?"

       Looking for a working definition of "kindness"   So, my  mom  called me last night and she sounded so sad. I really have no idea how to deal with that woman. I mean, she raised us and we are   perfect   ergo she must have done  SOMETHING  in a correct enough way for her to be able to replicate her success several times over. But she's so  disillusioned  and  bitter  and  ungenerous  right now. I can't imagine that she was "always like this" but I also can't remember a time when she wasn't to some extent. Seriously, the woman has none of the skills it takes to exist in the world she wants to exist in -- socially, I mean. She's loud, she's stubborn, she fails entirely to see any of her own complicity in situations that "for some reason" turn bad -- she's the opposite of the kids she raised. I seriously don't get it. I also don't get why I can't just be nice to her. I mean, I'm doing all this " basic acceptance " crap around really just getting that people are just people and that every single human being (even the very obnoxious) have some aspect of them spun in a way that I find admirable but I find it INCREDIBLY difficult to just freaking be nice to the woman who introduced me to the world. And believe you me, she needs it. I think it's a love thing. I get this  massive amount of love  from people and the world and my kid and I think it makes it easier for me to love back. My mom's pretty cut off. I mean, my brothers and I try to spend as little time as is humanely possible around her lest we go  insane  and start with the  shouting , she's hasn't had a "significant relationship" since the 80's and everytime she finds a job where it seems like people "need" her (like her teaching) she gets fired because she annoys the hell out of her supervisors. I dunno. I was listening to her last night and I kept thinking "Well, I seriously doubt that this latest notice came  completely  out of the blue. I mean, seriously, You're working for a   huge bureaucratic organization  , there are probably  multiple levels  of warnings you have to get before you can be let go. You probably just weren't paying attention because you  never  pay attention!" But instead, for probably the first time in my adult life, i just said "I'm sorry."   God. I hope like hell my kid is better at this than I am.

       Where's the balance?   Mistah Lovah Lovah  got  urlLink jacked  this week-end which  sucks  and for which I am sorry. I hate it when really stupid stuff happens to kind of decent people.   In other news  The Girl I Like  has  urlLink opted out  of our   consumeristic-car-driving-fossil-fuel-guzzling-space-degrading   culture. I think this is cool. By entension I think she is cool. Rock on,  Little Cello Girl , you and you alone are our hope for the future. (Er...that is, at least until our  little ones  are grown up and ready to take over, but seriously, until then, it's  all  you!)     Did I mention that I am  sick ?  Miss Bee  forced me to partake of some " holistic " drug thing and now I am  DYING !! At any rate. Ran into my beautiful  Professor K.  last night at school (I do this thing where I take the  long way  to class so I can walk by her office but she's never there so last night I was kinda running late so i took the  short way  and there she  was  coming down the hallway eating a cookie. sigh. I {heart} that woman.....) She just got back from N'orleans where she gave a talk on  conversation . I want to be her. ( And  do her. Let's not forget the " do " part...) Anyways, she brought me another  refrigerator magnet . NEVER let it be said that a heart cannot be solaced by a simple  refrigerator magnet ...! It's actually kind of funny. When I'm in a relationship with someone they can call me every day, remind me to pay my bills, buy me bikes and leather jackets for Christmas, love my kid and when all is said and done, I'll still probably be grouchy at them for forgetting that I like  Shilling  brown gravy not  Lawry's  dammit! But be a beautiful professor. Run into me randomly every few weeks , bring me  fridge magnets  and  cool pens  and I'm sooooooo all good! Weird.

       Happy Birthday  Happy Birthday  IHOEL  you are a man amoung women and we heart you very much!!! (actually, the birthday proper was yesterday I believe but still, better late than never, right!) Thanks to you and yours for the   delicious cupcakes   BTW, there was  much  discussion of the various merits of combining  chocolate cupcake-ness  with  chocolate frosting/sprinkles  on the way home...! Yum!  In other news:  This is  urlLink Sailor Uranus  (http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/1773/)   Sailor Uranus is a new Sailor Soldier who appears in the third season of the anime and manga series, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon. In the anime, she and her partner, Sailor Neptune, have a mission completely separate from that of the original five Sailor Senshi. Uranus and Neptune's goal is to find the three Talismans, which are the keys to finding the Holy Grail and preventing the Silence, the end of the world. Their methods are much more severe than that of the Sailor Team, and they believe that the death of innocents is a necessary sacrifice for the sake of the world. They often come into conflict with the other Sailor Soldiers.   Her civilian identity is Tenoh Haruka, a tomboy high school student (who pretends to be a man in the manga), who also is a famous racer. Her best friend and lover is Kaioh Michiru, whose other identity is Sailor Neptune.    Me and the kid went to  Blockbuster  last night, rented a  Sailor Moon  video (which, honestly I've never seen before although I'm familiar with the character) and in amoungst all the  teeny-bopping/bizzarro-world-eyes-turning-into-hearts anime crap  there suddenly appears this individual -- short hair, wearing a suit, whom I thought was a boy. "That's not a boy."  Patient child  explains. "That's   Sailor Uraneees  ." "Sailor-Who?" I inquire, still not quite  grasping  that this character in an immensely popular mainstream Japanese animation series was/is, in fact, a cross-dressing butch girl in love with a Blue-haired femme chick. Until the two of them changed into their   Sailor personaes   and all of a sudden  SU  was leaping around in the same super short schoolgirl outfit as the rest  of the  Senshi  battling a Vacuum cleaner woman who had hoses attached to her breasts (I honestly don't know...)  THEN  finally, it all became clear. (Clearer still when the kid said "That's her girlfriend!" about  urlLink  Blue Chick  ) And, with that clarity, for some reason, came the thought that the world may actually be changing for the better.

You're pretty narrow minded  and opinionated with regards to music (and probably most other things  as well). But you're allowed to be, because you really  are  better  than everyone else.

I just did more to assist the  fledgling relationships  of  random females  who I quite honestly feel I owe  no allegiance whatsoever  to before  9:00am  this morning than I think I've done in the  last thirteen years . Whatever. Maybe I'll get to move to the shorter line while I'm waiting to get into Heaven. Maybe not. Anyway. Good-luck, you guys! Thanks for the memories! Call when you find work...!

       My Bad!  Ha! It has come to my attention that that last post about "my dilema" could actually be thought to apply to  two  of the situations I've created for myself rather than just the one pathetic one. Quick show of hands for all those who thought I was talking about  Pretty Boy ? Nope. What I have with  Pretty Boy  is not pathetic at all. It is a freaking  GODSEND !  PB  is for all intents and purposes my lifeline right now. Yes, he's quite probably going to stop talking to me  the second  some hot young thing sits him down for "the talk" but that's fine. I mean I'll be sad/bummed and stuff but seriously, I  own  that boy -- he's got my name etched in scar tissue on his soul, he'll never be completely gone. Besides, he deserves the kind of happiness one such as I could never provide (at least not without a substantial make-over so...). The  other  one, the real dilema is not so much a dilema as a reason to discust myself... In fact, you know what, I've already spent too much time obsessing about it. Done. No more on that today. (Except to say that we are NOT hanging out tonight partly because I got a better offer and partly because he called me last night after reading this thing  to laugh at me ! Prick.)   Now then. First have to give  major props  to the  front neighbor . That woman somehow set up a situation where she gets to rip apart the house they're living in and rebuild it from scratch. We're talking  power tools ,  farmer's tan ,  sawdust  flying everywhere. I'd be jealous is I wasn't so freaking impressed...! (o.K. I'm jealous too but I'll contain myself so long as I get to watch...)  Next, big shout out to the lady at Alameda county who was gracious enough to answer my   WTF!!   e-mail re: why the hell we didn't get a kid (again) from them during this last little round of placementing. I try to make it a  point to try to understand that it's not me personally that sometimes there are forces behind a situation that I simply don't see and/or understand but still, it's hard and I was mad and she has been nothing but sweet and is continuing to talk to me about the process at ole Alameda county so kudos to you  Ms. D . You rock!   Hmmmmm. I think I'm going to actually stop here. I smell coffee brewing and the gal I need to talk to just walked in so... I'm out out out.  Happy St. Pats Day , people. Make it a good one!

      I'm hot. Not to be confused with  HOT  but really just kind of hot... and tired. I'm tired too. Consider the following situation:  Girl likes boy. Girl knows she has "no future" with boy so Girl encourages boy to get out and "meet people". Boy meets another girl. Girl is happy for him (really) yet at the same time feels an almost unquenchable urge to "fight" to "keep" boy all the while realizing she doesn't want him (not really, at least not permanently)... Girl thinks that it's probably a really good idea to just freaking leave boy alone so he can go be happy already. Girl is resolved. Girl feels good about her decision. Girl is finally feeling somewhat like an adult. Boy checks in.  Girl practically bites her tongue in half attempting to  not  shift conversation in any way toward discussion of concept of their "relationship". Girl  almost  succeeds. Boy inquires about girl's plans for  Spring Break . Girl mentions that she has none, thinks maybe they should "hang out." Boy isn't sure, needs to check out some stuff. Will call girl back. Girl hangs up phone and commences with the mental kicking of herself....   Now consider the question, as I have been for the last little bit now: What the hell is wrong with me????  Seriously. Pathetic doesn't EVEN begin to describe it. The two things that can happen here are: Boy says "sorry, can't hang out. To involved with my other person at the moment" thus hurting girl's feelings or Boy says "Sure! Love too" thus prolonging the slow, agonizing march toward the inevitable brush off.   Ah well, whatever. You only live once, right? ;-]

       Spring Break!  Whoo hoo! It's   Spring Break  ! Given that I  work  full time and have about a  ton  of reading to catch up on that really only translates to about   15 minutes   of actual additional time I have in which to  do nothing, but STILL!! Whoo Hoo! [I'm channeling  partially dressed twenty-somethings in Florida  right now! Can you feel it...?]

       Best Friends!  The  child  was  student of the week  this week and she got to do her little "How my week was" wrap-up today in class. After she gave the specifics, the  various class members  got to ask questions and one kid asked "Ummmm, who's your best friend?" and my  angel-child  said "Um, my moms!" (!!) To which the questioning child quickly replied "You can't have your  moms  as best friends!" To which my little   Star   replied "Uh Huh!" (again with the !!!s) and quickly moved on to the next question.  How much do we [heart] that kid????????   K. sorry. Just had to gush a little bit. Saw  Family Guy  today as I was out and about having lunch with the  Ladies  and now I'm feeling all  parental  and wanting to talk about my kid and stuff! Whatup  FG ! Me and you, lunch. Serious child discussing. Possible updated photo viewing. Let's make this happen!  Was talking to  Dirty Boy  last night (I know, I know, this in getting to be a  very  bad habit -- it's like talking to him is some sort of  gateway drug ) -- he offered what is quite possibly one of the most  brillant assessments  of something I've been known to do, that I think I've heard in a very long time. We were discussing relationships (of all sorts) and I was going on and on about "patterns" and "jelousy/lack thereof" and "closure" and stuff and he came up with this concept of a "release point" that is just  brillant . K. I'm probably not explaining it right but basically it's the point at which you just decide, for whatever reason, that you can let go of a particular "frame" and move on. Now it's interesting because it doesn't have to be a concious thing or a bad thing -- it's not the same as "the last straw" -- it's more like a final acceptance that you know something. Like when my kid learned to walk. She spend a long time tottering around with her arms out ready to grab at something in case she fell but then one day she just put her arms down. Like she knew she wasn't gonna fall and even if she did well, so be it.  Well, the reason I think this is so brillant is because I have been hard pressed to explain that thing that happens with me where if I'm in a relationship and it's faltering I will do  anything  to keep it going up to a point, then I just stop.  Now, I can't honestly say that whatever it was I was trying to keep going has suddenly become less valuable -- usually I still care a great deal and it kills me that I'm "giving up"-- but my need to "try", my need to have something be  necessary  to me, it just disappears. And it's not just relationships. It happens with jobs too. When I left my last job for this new gig i really could care less what happened to my old company and (not that they in ANY way deserved it) I previously felt a significant desire to try to make it work. Then, one day, after a year at  SNIFF , I just stopped thinking I could ever make it into something that would work for me. Which doesn't mean I stopped doing my job. I still did the best job I could and probably accomplished more during my last 6 months than ever before but it cannot be denied that it was VERY easy to leave when an opportunity presented itself.  DB's  theory is that I have a "release point" -- that my brain gets to the point where it's got enough information, tried enough things, put stuff in enough different positions, weighed enough of the options to finally know where it stands and when and if the situation requires action that supports that it makes perfect sense that not only can I completely change direction but that I can do it with some resolve. (Again, I know, I'm taking relationship advice from a  five year old degenerate  but still, it's a pretty interesting analysis...) It's also interesting that the situations that continue to prove most aggravating to me in terms of "lack of closure" are with people who I just don't think (for whatever reason) I'm "finished" with... Again, sorry, I'm totally rambling (I'm waiting for our test server to realize I put a bunch of files on it. Stupid test server!) but it struck me as kind of smart and applicable last night.....  Ooops! Looks like we're up. [FYI -  IS support chick  here at the new job ROCKS!!] BFN!!!!!!!

      How to be an idiot - Part I:  1) Run into girl you have crush on going up the stairs. 2) Ask her brightly how her dog is doing. 3) Notice that she is staring at you like you have something between your teeth -- When she responds [oh, so politely] with: "You mean   Emma's   dog?" realize you have her mixed up with  another  girl you were hitting on yesterday, lower your eyes, mumble something stupid and rush away from her down the stairs.   Doh!

       Tired...   Today I am exhausted. I was at a very  intense meeting  all day yesterday (which was v. fun BTW I got to talk to lots of  interesting co-worker peeps  and spend some actual quality time with  IHOEL  who's a  gem  of a person!!) Anyway, I got home and chatted with my conscious (aka  DB ) about this person who I  thought  I had a crush on but then started thinking that maybe I only thought I had a crush on her because it would be nice to have a crush on  someone  and she's really quite nice and could easily be crush material so... anyway, I sort of sat next to her at one of our  break-out groups  and talked to her a bit but I just don't know. I mean I still think she's freaking  FINE  but maybe our connection is meant to be different than "sparky." What if she's just meant to be my friend. My really really good friend. Who I get to crawl all over sometimes and kiss and stuff... -- k. i'll stop. (The sign of a  true dyke  BTW is that she's got to engage in some sort of  deeper analysis  in order to have a crush on someone who could honestly care less about her...)  so, we also talked about this  other  girl who I also feel kind of "sparky" about but then  MC/DB  says: well, why don't you get to know her then you can see if there might be something there" and I thought "Nah." I thought "nah" because I honestly feel (at this point in my life) that "getting to know people" for me is pretty much analogous to "making friends" and I don't feel  sparky  about folks who are in the "friends" category (at least not right now). Which is not to say that this can't change. And actually, even writing it doesn't sound entirely correct because I have no problem with having  sex  with my friends, it's just the "sparky" part; the tingley, can't wait to see you, can't wait to find out what dumb thing you did over the week-end, realizing that your eyes are actually kind of a  light hazel  rather than golden brown... all that crap, that's what I look for in my crushes and that's what disappears when I actually start seeing a person as a buddy. I dunno.  DB  thinks I'm being stupid. I think I agree.

      Ha!  Ex-Boss  just sent me a link to the new spiffy  urlLink website  which the mucho talented   urlLink Marsha   and crew just completed.  "Hi C.,  I thought I'd send you a link to our new web site - launched this weekend. We have updated the branding on our web site and updated the information on each of our practice areas. Thought you might be interested. Take a look when you have a moment. Hope all is well with you in your new job !!!  www.terrace.com  T."  O.K. first, I worked there for   5 years   as a "Creative Designer", does he  REALLY  need to remind me what the url for the site is? Second, I  care  that the information in "each of the practice areas" is updated?? Seriously... How is he so very wierd??!

       Something I just realized...  It's possible that I may no longer be "in step" with today's generation of youth. Case in point, witness the following IM conversation conducted via my home PC by certain persons under the age of 25 whilst I was on the phone talking the the ever-sweet  Miss Tail :   2BDtrMN:  Sup?  666touch:  Came to class   2B:  and?  Touch:  like nobudy bidness...  2B:  lol  T:  Hehehe...  2B:  Cici icq me...  T:  ?  2B:  Looking for Ling. Who was late BTW  T:  ADN...! Beowtch.  2B:  He said he would've sat beside me...  T:  Oh yeahhhhh  2B:  Soukie-sweet!  2B:  Damn...!  T:  ju chat?  2B:  for a while then...PSP  2B:  Ling came...She asked me why I didn't sit with Cici...If I did, she might have thought that I'm neglecting her right...?  T:  Beach  2B:  Hehehe...I'll never forget you as a friend girl...!  T:  After what you've done for me...! lol  2B:  Where are u?  T:  Oakie-town  2B:  Hugs!  2B:  :*  2B:  She putting out?  T:  U know it!  [ed. note - I  so  am not!]   2B:  Dawg!  T:  Hehehe...  2B:  K IO  T:  CY  Now, then, not only did I not understand the  vast majority  of the above conversation [reprinted, of course, with the consent of at least one of the parties concerned], I'm hard-pressed to state a  significant reason  for it to have been conducted at all but that may just be me...   Headache  persists  BUT  I was able to inform an interested party just this morning that on a scale from one-to-ten, I'm sitting at a  pretty solid 7  right now, so, that's gotta be good for something. Had a fairly  intense dream  about the  ex  last night though. She was dating some foreign chick and they were going to get married and live happily ever after. The  foreign chick  was also  quite visibly pregnant . Huh. I've been having a lot of really intensely disturbing dreams lately. Not that this one was so bad -- I mean, never let it be said that I don't wish my Exs  the  very best (it can be rumored and/or mumbled, though) -- just lots of dreams involving situations completely outside my control over which I have very  mixed emotions  is all.... Sigh. Anyway. I'm going to get the H -E-Double-hockey-sticks back to work now because, as we all know, nobody likes a slacker!

       Now then, where were we...?   Ah yes! The news (well at least all of it that's fit to print!) Let's begin by sending a rousing   "THANK YOU!"   to those of you who not only contenanced my  complete abdication  from blogging duties -- huge, stressful, deadline notwithstanding, I realize it is I who am entirely at fault here and I thank  GOD  that you've chosen to stick with me -- but who also provided interim support throughout what I'll simply refer to as "my dark period." I am back (although given that I'm finding new job, new classes and old life responsibilities the tiniest bit challenging right now, I may not be as " frequent/intensely entertaining " as past posting has been, I will however strive for  regularity   -- and c'mon, seriously, when one such as I has reached "a certain age" that's really all any of us can hope for!)   Thank you to  The Rabbit Lover  (also known as my loverly co-web-facilitator here in the trenches) she is fabulous and talented and a joy to work with. Seriously. I could not have survived without her.   Another big thanks goes out to the  Co-parent  who was almost scarily accomodating/sweet about schedule switchage and a whole host of other kid related things last week. I appreciate it and am grateful for your support.  Special thanks also to  Dirty Boy  who for some reason is just making me really happy right now. Don't know why. Probably won't last, but for now, you're a  sweetie  and I don't care who knows it!  Lastly, shout out to my  Best Buddy Q  for reiminding me of my  attendant duties  vis a vis  correspondence  with the world-at-large and who i'm sure  entirely fails  to realize that the  only  reason I cut  her/the rest of my sweeter-than-they-have-any-right-to-be peeps  off during times of  intense stress  is simply because they are just  too damn compelling  and I have TO WORK dammit!!! I know,  pitiful excuse  but I'm hoping to make it all up to everyone with lunch, hugs and copious mooning!  K. So what's been going on? Took  kid  to have her general medical check-up and found out (surprise) that she is jest fine. She's in the 15 percentile growth and 10th for weight which is normal and healthy, just small so I should stop with the worrying already [Fabulous  Dr.  didn't actually  say  that but you know she was thinking it!] Also, child has perfect 20/20 vision and excellent hearing (Yay! I'm telling you, there's definitely something to be said for selecting a donor specifically so he could "compensate" for your freaking near-sighted genes!)    Kid  dressed up as what she wanted to be when she grew up on Thursday and settled on  Veterinarian . She was a  People-Doctor  when I dropped her off at school so I'm not super sure what  machinations  caused her to alter her focus but, c'est lea vie, the world of animals has been doubly blessed.  Speaking of which, we have a   kitten  ! As we already well know, there is a pack of  feral cats  living in my front yard and while I have been laboring under the illusion that they are all   fixed   one of them has managed (possibly via  immaculate conception ) to produce an offspring. Said offspring suddenly started bounding about the front yard and steps a mere few days ago and while a significant part of my brain is thinking "Shoot! Now I'm going to have to  trap/ fix/feed/be kind of responsible for  yet another freaking cat!" the other part of my temporal lobe cannot help but think she's just about the cutest little gold-striped kitty I've seen in a very long time! If anyone wants a cat, let me know!  Note to  Angel  - sorry about your leg, buddy. I hope you heal up quickly. You're past the "growth" stage so you'll probably only be stuck with  residual  limping. Nothing that your  adorable smile  won't more than compensate for!   Travelin' Man  - Welcome back to the world of those who hate their job! (Well, I'm no longer  technically  a member of that  elite club  but I'll pretend for you if you like!) Seriously though, while I  am  somewhat sad for you, at the same time I am delighted for me because this means lunch dates which we've already established are my only means of communication with those who I actually like so, once everything's weighed and calibrated I'd have to say... bonus as far as I'm concerned!   Little L-Bee  - Sooooooo sorry you're sick. It sucks to be sick and it sucks to be little and sick and I wish there was something I could do to make everything better. If you think of anything let me know. otherwise just hang in there. You'll be better soon, I'm sure. [Ditto message to  Sweet Little Lu  but I think you're already better so just keep on keeping healthy! Kisses to both of you!]   Tony  - I  will  see you dammit! It's sunny, it's no longer as crazy, my horoscope said so (and you know how accurate those puppies are!) so... no more lolly-gagging. "Lunch date with T" has been written  in pen  in my calendar and as far as I'm concerned that's practically the same as having it passed as a joint resolution by the acting bodies of congress so... [sorry, i just finished writing my mid-term for my public policy class.... Ask me about   term limits  ! Go on, ask!]  Heard from the  CaseWorker  that we were turned down on all of the children we were being "considered" for last month. Am officially depressed about that but whatever. Will wait semi-patiently for whatever is supposed to happen to happen, I guess.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Went to see the   urlLink Lion king  . Costumes=amazing. Cast = o.k. Kid was entralled, though, so I spose it was almost worth mortgaging the house...   Plan to kick some  poker a**  in a coupla weeks so that's something to look forward to.   I think that's it really. I'm starting to get a slight headache so even if it's not, I'm still gonna go. Kisses to everyone. Mwah, mwah! I lurve you, all!

       Ways I torture myself - Part 1  O.K. so there's a  pretty significant list  of ways I set myself up to be miserable but this morning pinpointed a specific incident that led to one of those "larger epiphanies" about the world in general so I just thought I'd share. (Yay, you!)  K. So, I wake up every morning by having my  radio  begin playing this  urlLink stupid morning show  hosted by these oftentimes  fairly obnoxious people  so that I must immediately wake up and hit the snooze button. When I'm by myself this means I have  ten more minutes  during which to sleep/consider the various reasons why I pretend I exist/wonder how I'm going to get to work before the show starts again and I must  AGAIN  hit the snooze button. This can go on pretty much indefinitely. When I have the  Boo , she sleeps with me on  Thursday nights  which means that there is even more of a sense of urgency about waking up and smacking "snooze"  Friday mornings  since it's  pretty much a given  that the  first  thing blaring out of those ernstwhile speakers will be  "ass!"  or  "hairpie"  or  "fourteen children burned to death yesterday on thier way to school..."  So, to recap -- morning show comes on. I hit snooze. Show stays off for ten minutes then comes on again.   When I have the  Boo , my mornings are like this:   Wake up, hit snooze, yawn. Stretch. Stare at ADORABLE sleeping angel child snuggled up next to me. Make mental note re:  extraordinarily loud snoring  in order to torture her later when she is more fully awake and can become adequately annoyed. Get out of incredibly warm bed. Wander into bathroom. Brush teeth. Grimace at hair. Realize all clothing options SUCK. Radio show comes on again. Run into room to push "snooze" button.  Choose something relatively clean from clothing pile on floor assuring self that there will be time to re-consider outfit after everything else is sorted out. Go into kitchen. Assemble  exact same lunch  for  Boo  (with slight variations due to   yogurt/apple   availabilty) as I always assemble. Feel guilty. Resolve (again) to stop being such a   slacker mom   and learn how to put together  exciting, nutritious lunches  that involve  multiple tiny containers  and "fun" shapes. Radio show comes on again. Run into room to push "snooze" button. Go into livingroom, put lunch into backpack. Carefully remove, sort and stack  fifty thousand memos/papers/fieldtrip slips/cookies sale forms  . Resolve to carefully consider each and every one of them at later date. Notice that "things to carefully consider" stack is growing precariously large. Remove anything dated earlier than  March 3rd  to "recycling bin" (aka garbage can). Sign child's homework. Learn that her first grade class has apparently moved on to studying   quantum physics   (illustrated using boats and puppies) -- feel good about this while at the same time v.  inadequate/afraid.  Radio show comes on again. Run into room to push "snooze" button. Go into kid's room. Carefully choose  adorable , matching outfit. Go in to wake up world's sweetest sleeping child. Introduce her to outfit. Squelch hurt feelings as she (after considering my selection) gets up, goes into her room and selects a different outfit that is not only several times cuter than what I put together but also manages to be cleaner, hipper, and slightly derivative (but still better) of the outfit I, myself have on. Feel better, though, because we are now "twins!" Sit on toilet feeling completely unnecessary as child brushes teeth, brushes hair, assembles ponytails and wanders off to find "cool" shoes. Radio show comes on again. Run into room to push "snooze" button. Stand there a minute, then realize that instead of pushing snooze I could just  turn the volume all the way down . Resolve to do this next time. Check actual time. Realize we are about to be REALLY late. Run around like crazy woman assembling breakfast, finding sweater/jacket, feed cats, collect backpack, bag, PTA thingie asking whether or not you're most in favor of cutting funding for "the Art Center, Capoeira, the Computer Lab or the Science teacher", Radio show comes on again. Run into room to push "snooze" button -- Run out the door.  So. What was this core thing that I realized? This intrinsic, global concept that occured to me on my way across the bridge this morning? I realized that it's not the fact that we sometimes set up faulty patterns/make mistakes that makes us human. It's the fact that we never,  ever  learn from them/change. Thank you. More on this depressing thought later I'm sure.     In other news, though, kid drew the world's  coolest  sunset with crayons for me to bring to work today so I'm actually pretty happy right now. :-]

       I am here...  But I am  not  fresh.... I was out too late last night having a drink with the  Miss Tail  and laughing a whole lot then I sat on the bridge for  a very long time  while the road crews decided what they were going to do with the   middle three lanes  . Finally got home and couldn't get to sleep -- stayed up instead to watch  urlLink Slaves of New York  (quite possibly  the  finest motion picture ever made) This  urlLink reviewer , BTW, is obviously on crack.  Which leaves us now, here, very exhausted. I'm not sure why this whole non sleep thing is continuing to occur given the marked  lack  of stuff I have to do right now but, who knows... maybe it's "residue" stress.    Quick shout out to  Pretty Boy  -- His  urlLink company  is going IPO meaning he will soon be richer than  GOD  and I have got to say, it really couldn't happen to a nicer guy. All the best with your newfound wealth, my friend! If at any point you feel compelled to to kick down some bones so your favorite ex can get a  nice little duplex  in Oaktown, you jest give me a ringey-ding sos we can work out the details.  ;-]     Lastly, big ups to  BBQ  without whom I quite possibly would have failed to realize any of the true and lasting happiness that is currently my life on this planet. You are a  gem  of a person,  incredibly hot  and possibly the  best buddy  a human girl could ever hope to have. I.heart.you! Mwah!

       I'm DONE!!!!!!!  I'm done. I'm done, done, done. Done=me! That's right folks, the eagle has landed! Whew! Quick show of hands, who thought I wasn't gonna make it? K. {cracks knuckles} where were we? Let's see. I have a new friend. His name is   Ahn-drash   [that's phonetical BTW -- i have a feeling I'd  butcher  the real spelling]. He is from  Hungary . Been here for a year.  Very nice young man. Wanted to know if I was  American  {giggle}. Not sure why he decided to come to this particular  rathole of a country  but I'm sure I will be finding out soon enough. [Just kidding BTW. The  United States of America  is (are?) not a rathole(s?). This is the  greatest country   ever  and anyone who doesn't believe that needs to take their   terrorist a**   back to   Canada  , Pronto!]  {Sigh} I'm sooo happy right now.  Tired ,  disoriented  and  dropping stuff  but happy nontheless! I have  lunch  planned with my  BBQ ,  I have  celebratory drinks  after work planned with the glorious  Miss Tail  and, most importantly of all I have  no papers due !!!!!  O.K. Quick question? Why can I not get it up for  femmey girls ? There's a very nice girl in my now defunct Tuesdee class who has made it very clear that she wouldn't mind " keeping in touch  over the summer" (heh, heh, heh...)  and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, "you're interesting. You're funny. Why the heck shouldn't I hang out with you." But  then  I think about my  Pretend Girlfriend  who is  also  interesting and funny as well as being just plain HOT and I find myself not really all that interested in  Little Miss Longhair  anymore.  Ah well. C'est la vie and all of that. It takes all types right?

       Forced to start killing folks...!  O.K. seriously, if after being told that my diet consists primarily of  egg noodles  and  brown gravy , one more  otherwise sensible  adult acts like I just said " crack cocaine  and  lead " I will, hand-to-god,  go   Kill Bill 3   on thier ass! Can we all please remember,  carbs  don't kill people,  stupid extreme diets  kill people! God! I am in such an irritable mood today! I'm on page freaking  8  of a million page paper and i have  nothing  . else . to . say! If the  Children  were here they could all sit around in my living room talking about inane shit and at least providing some sort of diversion, but  no  they've decided   Austin   is better suited to their  delicate skating sensibilities  --   Austin  ! I ask you...??? I want a backrub, a margarita, some salty chips and a clean house.  I want this stupid paper done and I do  not  want to be thinking I should probably sign up for a summer class. I do not want to be in any way responsible for  anything  right now. I want someone to feed me, bathe me, make sure i get ten hours sleep a night and that I don't look stupid when i walk out of the house in the morning. And, yes, I get that had I started this stupid paper earlier I would not be sitting here right this second freaking out. aaarrrrrggggggg! I want my  Mommy . (Or at least the person my mommy was when I was  8  and the school nurse told her I was "easily distractable and possibly learning impaired" -- Turns out, I just needed  glasses . Couldn't see the board. Boy, did my go  ballistic  on that lady's a**! Tee Hee! anyway.... back to this stupid paper.)

       I don wanna talk about it...  Poker sucks.  At the time of my leaving though, this new chick  Nikki  looked pretty much to be cleaning up though so, I'm confident that the  estrogen  still prevailed last night!  Speaking of which, coupla thoughts about  boys . First off, last night we had some  new peeps  adding thier  personalities  to the poker-age and while I'm all for increasing the  pool of money  that I  will  win, one  particular  new person introduced  cigars  into the mix and I  just  have to say -- not all that impressed. It was funny though, When the subject of  smoking  came up, me and  Sir James  were kind of hemming and hawing, not  thrilled  but not being particularly  explicit  about our disapproval either (which, obviously DIDN'T WORK because half the room started puffing anyway!) but the  first  thing  Sweet Miss K.  said upon entering after a long day spent helping the less fortunate stop bleeding was "My God, what stinks??!" She then made everybody open all the windows and went on quite loudly for awhile about how annoying the smell/smoke was.  K.  rocks!    Anyway, I was talking about boys.... What was I going to say about that? Hmmmm. Oh, yeah, so  Cigar Man , in introducing the concept of smokage actually did ask if anyone would mind but he only asked the girls. Or rather he asked the  boys  what  they  thought the  girls  would think. The girls who were sitting right there. In the room. Actively engaging in the conversation and stuff. "How about the ladies?"  Cigar Man  inquired politely. I have no idea why this stands out as weird to me but it felt  solicitous  yet  dismissive  at the same time. ESPECIALLY when the anti-smokers were fairly divided evenly moungst the sexes. Anyway. Sort of drove home the point that there are some men that I'm just not going to "get" and that's o.k.   Second thing I was thinking involved older boys (like in their 20s) and little girls (we're talking 6 years old and below). Now before we go leaping  to the tried and true knee-jerk, cliched reactions vis a vis these types of relationships let me just say that this is  not  going to be a  fear-based discussion  about a  few  people who lose complete control of thier ability to  set and recognize appropriate boundaries  (if they ever had the ability that is.)  Child-molesters  suck. We hate them. Moving on. What I find interesting is the fact that there seems to be some impetus for twenty something boys to really connect with little girls in a way that is really comfortable and easy for both of the parties involved.  Boo  has at least  three  older gentleman friends ranging in age from 23 to 29. They are all upstanding (mostly), responsible, sweet young men and, for some reason, they all seem to really enjoy hanging out with my kid. And we're not talking about  babysitting  here, we're talking about hanging out, having conversations, factoring in time to re-connect, getting added to the official  Boo  phone list, etc. etc. etc. For the record I think it's   great   but I'm still a little in awe of my six year old's ability to have the kind of relationships with  grown men  (minus the sex) that most of my  straight girl friends  would KILL for.  Anyway. This is already getting rambley so I'll stop now. Happy day people. Make sure it's fun!

       Tired but generally good...  And about to  KICK  SOME POKER A**!!!! Thas right, Baby!   Throwing down   will happen tonight! Some will win, some will lose -- but all will be  dominated !!  eh, hem. Now then. I'm changing the referrential name of my  New Girlfriend  to   Pretend  Girlfriend , mostly because I don't want/am not ready for/am getting wierded out by even joking about having anything even  close  to a G-friend ever again so, for now (because I like her and want to keep talking about her ad infinitum) I'm going with a fresh monniker.  Pretend Girlfriend  called me last night to arrange for some carpooling type activity and can I JUST say I got soooo  happy about it. Beyond all reason actually. No idea what my deal is. I'd spent the evening at school having inappropriate connversations with the 22-year-old- children  in my class so, I guess maybe I was just kind of excited to be able to flirt with a  peer  for awhile. Anyways. Me=starving so I'm out, out, out. Peace!

       I'm thick!  I am dying! I am stuffy and sneezey and tired-ey... I know, I know. Poor little basically healthy, getting to play with websites all day, going to a great school and getting to "intellectually engage" with some of the finest minds in the  Oakland Unified School District ,  mom to world's perfect-est 6 y.o., loved and supported by the world's coolest family, surrounded by a pack of buddies that are  scary  in thier overall perfection... blah, blah, blah... Actually. No "blah, blah." Writing that list just put me in a much better mood. Ha! go figure. At any rate, let's discuss my group last night shall we?  First, let me begin by saying one of the members of my little  four person discussion group  is across the board one of the most objectively, physically  beautiful  girls the world has ever  produced. I mean this. I am convinced that  97% of the known world  would recognize some hint of classical gorgeousness in this Lady's perfectly symetrical features, pearly little teeth, dark, flashing eyes, rounded smooth features and full curving body etc. And yet, I have to say, There is  another lady  in our group who is much more  angular , sits kind of hunched over. thinner lips. A bit freckled who I would soooooooooo much rather be  stranded with  if you get my meaning. At any rate. We had quite a delightful discussion around  urlLink The Essential Conversation  vis a vis  parent/teacher conferences  and "authentic" connections to student work (I know,  booooring  but I find it kind of fascinating -- well, as fascinating as a thing can be when you're sick and coasting on two hours sleep...) and it came out that this little  pack of soon-to-be teachers  are somewhat  terrified  of talking to parents! Now, representing the other side of that coin (myself being a parent that gets all  wierd  and  defensive  at  P/T confs .) I found that FASCINATING! Like whatamIgonna do? Bite you?? And if I did, how would that translate to how you'd treat my child...? anyway. interesting.     On a much  sadder note , the  Children  are leaving me. They're off off off to join  GW  in the land of  Bush  -- Damn you   Texas Man  ! Damn you for creeping into my  Angel's  life and stealing away my  only connection  to the up and coming generation!! Hmmmm. well. probably for the best (i don't think I was doing all that great a job raising  three twenty-somethings  -- the "incest" alone would have Social Services knocking on my door in  at least 36  of the continental  United States ...!) I'll miss you guys v. much. I hope things are  fabulous  for you out there and that you will call and write and just generally let me know how you are. Remember, if you need ANYTHING ... call  OT 's dad, he's loaded!

       2 -- count em --  2  hours of sleep last night...  What in God's name is my problem. Like it isn't enough that I have to figure out a way to produce  20 odd pages  of  public policy analysis  by next Tuesday, I need to keep myself  awake  all freaking night as well???? {sigh} It's all good though because my own personal saviour-chick over in the Marketing Dept.  just  gave me a  tiny pizza   and  I got to see my  New Girlfriend  (who is sick so there's that whole additional level of adorable-ness going on there!) K. I just wanted to check in and whine a little. I'll stop now.

       Fucking elephants...!  K. So my  kid  tells me she had a  bad dream  last night. Apparently she  "was going into the man's house because the elephant told her it was o.k. but then when she got inside the lady screamed at her."    What the F---??! First off, what the hell is an   elephant   doing telling my kid she can go into some  random house  where there is obviously a crazy person living and second off, how dare some  wacked out female  start screaming at my kid for something she was in no way responsible for? (!!) Bitch.  Anyway. We had a snuggle and it was all good, but still. I think kid's scary dreams are scarier than adult scary dreams. i mean, I can kind of tell where most of my  anxiety dreams  are coming from. But  talking elephants that set you up ?? I mean, what're you gonna do with  that ?  In other news, going to the  Bee's house  tonight for some fun and festivities. Yay, us! Then heading into a week-end that looks remarkably "ish-oos" free -- except for the fact that I have to write  yet another paper  (due on  Monday .) {Sigh.} How is it that one can be so close, and yet still so far....

       Bite marks...  Howdy folks. Let me begin by saying I am  tired . Let me go on to say that for the first time in quite along time I know  exactly  why i'm so tired and truth be told I don't mind  even a little bit !   Eh hem, now then, where were we. Hung out with my  New Girlfriend  last night. Have I mentioned that that girl is freaking HOT?? Well, she is. And sweet. We went out for drinks and to go get our  Vietnamese food   on  (I think those of you who know me  even a little bit  can guess just how  wrapped  I currently am based entriely on the fact that when  NG  suggested   Vietnamese   food my response was " K.! ") during which events  NG  spent a good amount of time providing very thoughtful and detailed analysees of some questions I'd come up with for my  Families and Communities  class.  NG  rocks. Stayed out too late though and spent way too much time analysing  every single thing  both of us said and did so I didn't get to sleep until  3am  or something obnoxious like that. Still and all though. I like her. She's a keeper that one. Hopefully she will continue to grace me with her exalted presence. Please, please, please.....     In slightly sadder news, the elderly father of my Kid's other Parent passed away yesterday. My condolences  CP . I hope you get the support you need around this and that this provides some of the closure you were looking for.   Aight. I actually have an incredibly busy day today so I'm out, out out! Happy Thursday to you all!

       Stupid happy right about now...  First, can i JUST wish a big ole hearty CONGRATULATIONS to my dear friend Elise and her (now) wife, Jenny on thier recent nups! Here's wishing you kids all the best that life has to offer and then some!  Next, can i just say OUCH! re:  BBQ  lopping off most of her  hand and forearm  in a tragic  blender  accident. She went over a few of the more pertinent details vis a vis "painkiller" injected  directly  into the  tip of her severed finger  {shudder} but I really can't dwell on it right now..... Suffice to say, i am soooooo sorry you got hurt,  BBQ  and that your hand continues to hurt. If you need  anything  from me (Headscratches, back rubs, undoing buttons, eh, hem...) you just let me know, Missy! I am sooo there!  And finally let me just say i am soooo feeling the love from  my crush-objects  right now! (Interesting that it took me  swearing off them  to inspire this devotion.... veerrrryyy interesting, indeed! But still, nice!) My beautiful  Prof. Ketelle  went on yet another fact finding mission, this time to the sunny shores of  San Diego  and (without a single prompting word from yours truly!) brought me back another  fridge magnet  for me to add to my now really  quite impressive collection ! We heart her so much it hurts! Then I have a "date" with my  New Girlfriend  tomorrow wherein we will sit around discussing "community" issues and, more importantly, wherein I will have an opportunity to stare at her like the  lovesick, pathetoid  that i am and not have to worry about freaking either of us out overly much! how great is my paper-writing life right now???? k. nuff about all of that. I just had some moments to kill before class and i was feeling strangely upbeat about the life. more tomorrow, maybe. if I don't expire from the sheer happiness first!

       Hello, Bunnies!   Happy Easter  everyone! Spent a good chunk of my  Easter Day  at the  B house  and can I JUST say, those people are  fab-u-lous ! I am  so  glad they let me hang around their   amazing family-ness  , I really am.  Easter Din  consisted of some very yummy mashed tates, asparagus and  a side of pork  -- very tasty and very filling! I got to take a few pounds home with me to snack on throughout the course of my  six-hour paper writing stint . Speaking of which, I am so tired right now that  I may die . Seriously. The  kid  was up all night Sat. night, meaning her mom was up all night as well -- the  key difference  being that the kid  accepted  the fact that she was up and actually got some stuff done whereas her mom kept trying to pretend she  wasn't actually awake  and instead spent the better part of the night lying very still with her eyes squeezed shut listening to the refrigerator door open and close, the dolls come out, cheerios being poured, etc. Seriously, even the cats got annoyed (they're not allowed to wake me up so they do this thing where they hover  three inches away from my face  until I'm officially awake then they start pushing at me in an effort to get petted/fed so this whole "fake sleep" thing was really messing with their mojo. "Is she awake?" "Will she pet us?" "Are we allowed to jump on her?" "Oh, whatever. Let's go play with the little one.")     Paper 1 of 3 actually did get written though (i haven't re-read it yet so I'll bet it's a mess but at least it's out of my head and onto paper), that's good. Two more to go and I'm free free free! Well, at least for the next coupla months anyway.     I had a  third thing  to write about but I've forgotten what it was. Hmmmmmmmm. Spent waaayyyyyy too much time this week-end thinking about my  New Girlfriend  (calm down everyone, we're only together in my head which is probably for the best. Fewer opportunities to argue about how we never have sex anymore. ha! Sorry.) Oh! I remember what it was -- I peeked outside last night and saw that my  amazing front door neighbor  had not only completely freshened up the front (my front, her back) yard but that she'd also cleaned up up the miniscule plot of land that me and the  Boo  use when we're pretending we know anything about gardening! Yay, her! We wuv!! K. That's it for right now. I'm off to find  coffee . Lots of it. In fact I wonder if  urlLink Starbucks  does an intravenous feed...?

       Get This Party Started!  O.K. so is "Get This Party Started" by Pink not THE BEST SONG EVER??  "boulevard is freakin' as I'm coming up fast I'll be burning rubber You'll be kissin' my a**!"  Genius!!!   (And don't give me any of that "Well, I'd  hardly  call it the  best ever  -- what about the  Beatles   urlLink White album  or anything by   urlLink Zepplin  ?? In the parlance of my six-year-old  {roll eyes} "Blah, blah, blah!" )  K. So anyway. I had declared  celibacy  regarding my getting crushed out on folks during the month of April, onna counta I have  sixteen zillion papers  due by the freakin' 27th (!!)  I declared celibacy regarding having actual sex too but that was more rooted in the fact that I just wasn't liking the sex I was having (Ha! Kidding! Actually it just the  ONE  that I was  DISSATISFIED  with.  Pretty Boy  was great! :-] ) Hee Hee. Sorry, I just really love being aboe to talk about people without haveing to hear back from them right away. Especially when WE ALL KNOW who I'm talking about but if that person gets all ansty at me they're basically outting themselves as a LOUSY LAY and thereby setting themselves up for years of ribbing by pretty much every single one of our mutual friends. {sigh} It's good to be Queen. Now then, where the heck was I?? Oh yes, crushed out. I'm not crushed out  yet ,  but I can sense it coming on. It doesn't help that everyone here is so freakin' adorable and nice and accomodating... and that all we do all day is talk about SEX. I know. Poresito. Shutting up now.  Except, I'm trying not to be a freak about this.

      I'm in a weird mood right now. I just got off the phone with this   CHILD   who, when I told him that I  maybe  was  kind of possibly  starting to  like  this person I work with, stated: "Great! Did you need to borrow my bike or are you going to chase  this one  down on foot?" Which was not only  not  funny, I'd have to say it bordered on   obnoxious  , especially coming from  him , ferchrissakes... yet and still, though... it got me thinking. What it got me thinking was this:  Have  I ever been involved with someone with whom I have not made the proverbial "first move?" I really don't think I have. Why is that? Maybe it  might  be a good thing to see if it's even  possible  for me to just hang out with someone I like and stop trying to freaking  force  everything. Not in  this  instance of course.  This  instance is a "soooo not going anywhere" sitch but maybe... possibly... if I ever decide adult humans are again worth the effort.... Nah. I've taken my vow of celibacy (which extends to crushes) and i will  stand fast  regardless of the myriad temptations... {snicker} Quick show of hands, who believed  that  one??

       Who's supporting who?  Know why I love my kid? (I mean, besides the  obvious ...!) Because she's  constantly  crafting these moments wherein I can feel like I'm a good mom. Case in point, we're in my " Families and Community " class last night discussing  school newsletters  and  Prof. D  is making a list of reasons for sending these things out, so he calls on this one chick who says "Newsletters are a good way to inform parents of things that might be coming up or that might be important to the kids but not necessarily to the parents."   K. So while  Prof.  is writing this down,  Kid  says to me  sotto voice  but still loud enough for  surrounding classpeeps  to hear: "Mommy, is there anything that is important to me that isn't important to you?" To which I get to reply: "Nope. If it's important to you it's important to me!" Thus ensuring that I have a warm, supportive, "good mommy" medal practically glued to my chest for the rest of the evening. I swear, it's like slow pitch softball. I  know  she's feeding me the easy ones but gosh, it still feels really good to be able to occasionally knock one out of the park!

       Thank you, thank you, thank you!   My  extreme thanks  and gratitude to all those who lent an entertaining hand this week-end and assisted in  Boo  watchage thus allowing me to wallow waist-deep in paper-producing -- I am grateful to have such  fabulous persons  in my life to serve not only as  eye-candy  but also as  stand-up pals  when I need somewhat responsible types to entrust the only thing that really matters in my life to. You collectively rock!     K. Know what I hate about Daylight Savings time? (I mean, besides the part where we  lose  a freaking  hour  of our lives??!) I hate the fact that for the first few days, weeks , months, following  the switch  I've got this wierd  mistrust  of time. I mean, seriously, it's like the we  had  something that was  real , that I  depended  on and now... well, I just don't know any more nawwhattamean? It's like a bad relationship where you know you should leave but for whatever reason you just can't so you stick around but deep down you're just waiting for the next time.... Anyway. We'll do some group therapy around this. It'll be fine.     I finally found a real, concrete use for cell phones. Work just ordered me to carry around this "tool-of-the-devil", (Bastards. Although, by and large, they continue to rock hard so I'm not  really  complaining even though it does feel the tiniest bit  FAUSTIAN ! Anyway...) so, yesterday I'm waiting in the   urlLink movie theatre   for  Friend Number One  to show up with  my child  who he's managed to  abscond  with for a  large chunk of the day  and I realize that they're not going to arrive on time because time isn't exactly being what you might call "straight up" about anything so i call him -- from the theatre! Just like that! Didn't have to go outside into the freezing cold. Didn't have to find a freaking quarter. Didn't have to do a damn thing other than pick up the world's tiniest phone, figure out how to turn it on, push some random combination of numerals and hope to god it actually connected to the person I wanted it to... et viola! There he was! At home. About 40 minutes away from a show which started in 15.  He  may be useless as a friend but I have to say I'm begining to see the lowly cell phone in a whole different light! Now if I can just figure out how to turn it off....

       Happy Birthday!  Happy B-Day  Travelin' Man  (yesterday, actually, but  I find that if I don't write about this stuff as it occurs to me well then it'll never get posted!) hope the day was  Fab-u-lous  and that you are enjoying the very few years left to you on this planet! Ha! Kidding. you don't look a day over 47! Really, I mean that!

       Reason #6 why I {heart} my kid's teacher   Me:  [serious, frown-ey expression] So, I've been reading  urlLink The Essential Conversation  by  Sarah Lawrence-Lightfoot  and i just have to say that I've been  completely  moved by it and regard it as one of Education's  seminal texts . I hope we can put some of her  key principles  in action today during our  Parent/Teacher  conference and really have some  authentic  connection around the  Boo .   Boo's teacher:  [Huge smile] Well, I hadn't planned on any of that but I'll see what I can throw together!   Hee Hee! She's a keeper that one!

       Kindness of strangers...  Attempted laundry today with the  kids  in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. i also learned how remarkably sweet  total strangers  can be for no reason other than because they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my "wash-day" outfit... Also, I'm not surper sure I'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olefactory incentive there!  I am doing two things right now. I am composing  an  post and I am also watching The Collected No Doubt Videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room. There are many reasons why this whole situation thrills me to no end but the top five are as follows:  1)  Travelin' Man  lent me this super nifty DVD player as well as bought me this cool DVD featuring the aforementioned videos.  TM  rocks. hard.  2) Whilst my computing area was established via my "desktop" PC I rarely (read "never") used it just for the fun of it.  Boo  played on it quite a bit but it wasn't easily hooked up to any sort of  internet access source  so mainly it was all about typing papers and working on stuff I copied onto a disk from work and brought home. Since getting a work laptop the only time the  Pink Monstrosity  was called into play was when  Boo  wanted to make stuff using  KidPix . I've since shipped  PM  off to my mom in NM ( big Brother  just set it up for her. Interestingly enough  he's  the  best kid  now cause he set the thing up. Me? I just  shipped  it! Whatever. It's not like I've only got the  one  mom -- wait... ;-]) Anyway! Long story short, I got a new laptop, wireless DSL and a relatively clean work area on the world's coolest drop leaf desk. My computing life right now is  sweet .  3)  Baby  is asleep. My God, can I  just  say two kids is  exhausting . I'm not going to go there with the "careful what you ask for" blah, blah, blah because I'm the   luckiest   human being on the planet and this luck is best illustrated by taking a cool appraising glance at the stuff in my life that is  exactly  as I requested it... I'm just tired is all and glad  Sparkle  takes the occassional nap so I can stop chasing her around...  4)  Boo  is better. She was sick yesterday. Throwing up. Miserable on the couch all day. 102.5 fever. I called the advice nurse at Children's who scared the HELL out of me -- "Sounds like she has a   stomach virus  . Could last up to  48 hours . Vomitting will probably be followed by diarrhea which could last for up to  five  days. Call us back when her temp hits  104 . Other than that just keep her comfortable and hydrated." WTF??! Anyway, she stopped vomitting mid-day and her temp never went higher than 102. No diarrhea either. She was MUCH better this morning. Ergo, my world=great.  5) La, la, la! I get to see my  Pretend Girlfriend  tomorrow. I haven't seen her in  forever  and I had  just  decided I needed to stop acting silly vis a vis her adorableness when (ta-da!) I went to see my  BBQ  who got me all stirred up again. So, we're pretty much back at square "stupid" -- ah well. There are no doubt worse people to have crushes on. (In fact... I think I've already cycled through most of them!)  So, there you have it. I'm happy right now. Tired but happy. I also have the best friends ever with the cutest hand-me-downs for my  Sparkle ! I'm telling you, I don't think I could have planned this better if I'd  tried !

       I'm alive...!  Just barely! Thanks to  Travelin' Man  for being the absolutely  sweetest person ever  and spending the better part of  sixteen weeks  (o.k. more like two hours) getting my  DSL  installed/set-up once the "user-friendly" directions FAILED ENTIRELY to work. Also thank you for the mondo sweet prezzies and the gratis computer tweaking. What did I do to deserve such  phenomenal  friends??! Seriously?? Anyway. I'm tired. I'm happy, lucky, more than content with the direction the life has seemingly finally been steered in. I am also scared, tired, slightly blue and really not very sure what THE HELL I was thinking but, whatever. You do what you gotta do right?  Sparkle  is here full-time permanent-like. Papers have been signed. She's basically ours. There are certain "i"'s that will need to be dotted circa  November 26th  but for all intents and purposes she be  mine . (I'd insert an evil laugh here but I just don't have the energy.) I'm 97% sure I can get her into  God's-own-Daycare  too where she will not only be tended far better than I ever could but will also be fed  three nutritious meals  a day and allowed to pull everything she can get her tiny little hands around onto the floor. She'll also learn  Spanish . Hmmmm. Wonder if I can get  myself  in there...  Quick shout out/feel better to  Miss Bee  who is having all her teeth removed today (why is it exactly that the ones they pull out are the ones we call our  wisdom  teeth. I just can't help but feel that that's just really somehow ill-advised...) I hope the swelling is minimal and that the rebound time is short. Love to  BBQ  who was gracious enough to entertain me and  Sparkle  today and who I adore because she is one of the few people who can get me all giggley in spite of the fact that I'm exhausted, haven't showered in a week and am concentrating on spooning yogurt into a-should-be-sleeping-fusspot of a baby.  BBQ , you rock. {sigh} Actually, I think I'm going to stop there. i have a big little one who needs me to go scare away the strange voices in the bedroom and a littler little one who's going to wake up in 2 hours demanding watered down apple juice and a backrub so, I should get some sleep while the sleeping ees gutt. Kisses to all. Huge   Thank You   to all you sweet beautiful people who are being so happy around my happiness. I've got the best friends ever and I hope I tell you how much you all mean to me at least half as often as I think it!

      Hey everyone, quick update, transition happened so now we have  Sparkle  full-time at our house which is FAB-ulous (and tiring -- how'd I forget this whole babies not  sleeping  thing? Hmmmmmm.) In a completely unrelated incident the world exploded at work at about the same time so, oddly, while I thought there might be more of a  stretch  between the time  Sparkle  arrived at our home and was introduced to work, I've come to find that this was very short indeed. She's here right now whilst we wait for some meeting to start and she's being awfully patient, I must say... Anyways. That's all the news really. As soon as I get  DSL  up at home I'll start posting again with more frequency. Til then, guess you're just going to have to call for the deets! ;-]

       Luckiest person ever!   Just a quick check in to say that I am the luckiest person EVER! I went down to see my  Sparkle  today and took her for a walk around  Foster Mom's  neighborhood.... Can I  just  say, SUCH a beautiful place to grow up! Quiet, peaceful. Trees and flowers and friendly waving people everywhere... really I don't think I could have asked for a more idyllic setting for my Baby to have spent her first year.  FM  has been and continues to be GREAT! She's just so committed and caring and cool... I dunno. It's just really amazing to me that she and  Sparkle  found each other and that she's so good to her babies and that she likes and supports me being her bub's new  Mommy ... {sniff, wipe eye} it's just all really cool is all! (P.S. I got a   Sparkle smile   today when I walked in! Have I mentioned she's A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E!!!!)

       My house is a mess!  K. So, in an attempt to begin moving things into a fit enough state to host the new kid, I have somehow managed to make my house even more inhabitable (if that's possible) than ever before. {Sigh.} I need to just start throwing things into boxes and letting  god  sort it all out! Speaking of which, how quickly have I moved from "Resigned to just having the one kid for the rest of our collective lives" to being "slightly annoyed that this lady in   San Jose    still  has my baby!" Now don't get me wrong. i am grateful beyond belief that  Foster Mom  is such a very stellar person and that little  Sparkle  has had the benefit of being in one (secure, loving, capable) place all of her short, sweet life but still and all, now that I've met her, now that we've all  pretty much decided  that she's mine -- I'm just kind of not really seeing what the  freakin' hold-up  is! See, there I go agian. Of course I see what the hold-up is. the hold-up is that this woman has been raising/bonding with this person for a   year   and I'm waltzing in and carting her away without even an "if you please." How much do I suck?? A few things I'm realizing:  1) It takes a certified  saint  to be a foster mom. Don't hand me your stories of blah, blah, foster mom who's "only in it for the money" bullsh*t...!  Sparkle's FM  has been doing this for  fourteen  years. She's had more than  275 kids  pass through her house. She's 56 years old, currently adopting a three-year-old and  STILL  is having a hard time with the thought of my  Sparkle  leaving her. A   Saint   I tell you!  2) How much must it suck to be adopting a baby where you actually  know  the birthmother. Especially sucky if she's not such a bad person. Like if you're just waiting around for some teenager to pop so you can wisk her kid away to "a better life." Seriously, I'm just starting to realize how very fortunate me and the  Boo  are to be able say in no uncertain terms (relatively) that this kid we're getting will most likely benefit from knowing us as much as we'll benefit from having her in our lives.   3) Skin color is a pretty significant trump card. Things I'm realizing the more I talk to  Foster Mom  include the fact that she, herself, was considering adopting my bub (and probably would have gotten her, too) but held off because she had faith that "God was going to be sending the right person!" Well, she was right about that but the interesting thing here is that the  short list  of her prerequisites vis a vis "right" are... "African-American." That's it. There were "two ladies" that applied that she fancied herself "dismayed" by (assumingly they were lesbos) and although she  did  say that "she could have accepted their 'lifestyle' if they'd seemed  really  interested in  Sparkle " she later confided that she was "delighted that they dropped out" because they were both {shhhhhh} "white!" Interesting. Not that I'm  complaining  since sum total, I win but interesting nontheless. Also interesting to see what she makes of the fact that "God" has sent a  big ole dyke  who was raised by her  white  mom and who works in the adult   SEX   industry!  :-] Not that she's going to really  know  about any of that until  after  all the  appropriate paperwork  has been signed but one can't help but think that p'raps her God  does  work in mysterious ways!  Anyway,  Boo  met  Sparkle  yesterday and the two of them got along swimmingly. Another thing I forgot in my hyper-focus on "the attendant issues that will no doubt arise" was that  Boo  is the world's best kid. After we'd hung out for awhile and were on our way back home I mentioned to  Boo  that I was the world's luckiest mom becuase I had the world's best kid. She (perfection incarnate) replied "Kids. You have the world's best  kids ."

       Memories...  {sniff} Put together the  Boo's old crib  last night in preparation for  Little Miss Sparkle  coming to stay and I have just  got  to say - I love that crib. I have all these memories of my  Boo-Beane  circa one-year-old clinging to the bars and chewing on the railing... I don't think she ever actually slept there but my goodness it all kind of came rushing back. It's a great crib too.  Both  sides come down -- one-handed operation too; definitely NOT to be underestimated believe you me!

       Really just beautiful...  Hello folks. Sorry, I've not checked in before this -- I know many of you have been waiting with baited breath to hear how things went with  Potential Daughter #2  who shall henceforth be referred to as  Sparkle  but everything is moving  really fast  all upon a sudden and I've just been running around trying to catch up.   Meeting with the various  Caseworkers  went well. Meeting with  Foster Mom  (who is GREAT, albeit in an uber-Christian sort of way) went great. Meeting with my dear sweet little  Sparkle  went great! Sum total = She's healthy and fabulous and developmentally on target and I'm pretty happy about all of that. Not to mention the fact that she is a-dor-rable! Second upshot of all of this is that they ( Caseworkers  et al) are seeing this "placement" happening at THE END OF THE MONTH. That's right folks I need to figure out  every single thing  that needs to be figured out vis a vis  adding a happy, healthy one-year-old to our family  in the next   week   or so. In addition to the fact that, due to her age the game plan is for me to go down there ( San Jose ) fairly often to participate in her daily care so she can watch her  Foster Mom   approve  of me and which will help the eventual transition but which (like this morning) also sort of translates into a  2 hour drive to give a 20 minute bath . Me = soooo  not  complaining though. She is great! I am happy! Overwhelmed. Scared. Not just a little freaked out, but HAPPY nonetheless!!

       Happy Belated Moms Day!  Hope everyone loved their moms up very much yesterday! If you are amoung those not fortunate enough to have a mom who deserves serious lovin' then I hope you managed to find a suitable replacement and failing that, at least manged to get out and live a little!  Speaking of all of that, my own personal week-end was grand! Sat. was a bit tricky with me and the  Boo  -- lots of sadness and tears "for no reason" (I feel like there's this  huge wave cresting  vis a vis new  baby sister  and Boo's  completely freaking-out  that I'm expecting and ostensibly "prepared for" that's just so going to   suck   when it actually happens) but I think we're both just going to have to stick it out and deal with stuff as it comes up and that everything will work itself out. Still tough though.   Sat. eve we attended an  gala event  to support  CP 's  latest movie  which also featured a dashing  Miss Tail  and a very spiffily cleaned up  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  so whilst I may have been able to imagine several other ways I could have been spending my Sat. night, this one didn't turn out to be all that taxing. I {heart} my friends!  Sundee morning, hooked up with the  CP  and we all went and had a very festive  Mom's day brekkie , which was nice. After that  Travelin' Man  and I went to go see  urlLink Kill Bill 2  which was GREAT (and v. mother's day affirming in it's own twisted way... Favorite Quote from the movie: "Not that it's any of your business but I'm a  fuckin' surgeon  with a shotgun!") OH! And get this, I'm buying my ticket to go see this  "R" rated movie  which, correct me if I'm wrong but, I  believe  means "you must be at least  18  years or older to attend" and the ticket lady  asks me for my ID ! Seriously! At first I thought it was just a standard thing but then she proceeds to NOT ask  TM  for his! WTF??? Anyways, the rest of the movie going experience was grand and the sitting in the cafe and chatting and the music shopping after was also grand! Really, I don't think I could have imagined a more fabulously relaxing afternoon! Thanks  TM  for the stellar companionship! After all of that, I ended my glorious day/eve by hooking up with the ever sweet  Pretend Girlfriend  who made time in her busy schedule to stop by and spend some quality time on my couch shootin' the sh**, having a beer and jest plain being a very good sport about my obsessive need to stare at her. Seriously, I get that I'm a very lucky girl but sometimes I feel doubly blessed!

       Not so great today...  Today we have a  headache . Just a titch of a headache -- nothing to stay home over, but an headache nonetheless. The  child  is not so happy either. Kind of  sad  and  clingy . She was v. unhappy with the idea of my not staying with her while she was in class today. All day. After  five years  in the  managed care/school system  my kid actually still thinks on some level that my  staying with her in class all day  is an option that I just  choose  not to do. And, I guess she's right. If I really want to analyze it, I guess I  could  sit with her all day.   She   comes to my work to hang out with   me  . Hmmmm. P'raps that's what I'll do. Pick a day and just follow her around. Yeah, that's what I'll do.  Now how do I set that kind of thing up?  Anyway, could be accumulated stress (lots of  big life-changes  coming up for discussion -- baby sister suddenly becoming a realistic possibility, school ending, just getting older in general), could be lack of sleep (we were both kind of tossey and turney last night), could be the fact that we have  too damn much to do  this week-end (all fun stuff but still stuff that requires doing in a relatively short amount of time), could be anything really. Combine this with the fact that I just "solved" this issue we were having with pricing this morning by suddenly  paying attention  to something that our  Goddess IS chick  had been trying to explain to me for  close to an hour  and which, once I actually  heard  what she was saying and took a quick glance at, was pretty straightforward. God. I'm suspecting that I will by-and-large be COMPLETELY WORTHLESS today. I sure as hell hope nobody needs anything important....

       Career Day!  Whoo Hoo! just got back from talking to  thirty   12 year olds  about my "career" as a web designer/artiste. I had fun. Hopefully, they did as well. They were actually all  pretty damn adorable  (and  TALL  -- my god, what are they feeding these children??) some of them were completely uninterested but they were all super respectful and nice. Then there were like a handful who were obviously way into it but it was difficult trying to explain  the process ,  the software , how I  came to be a web designer  and  helpful places  they could go on-line to learn this stuff -- all  in under 10 minutes  while, at the same time trying to be  engaging . Still and all though, aside from the fact that the   tiniest   of them still towered over my  short little self , I'm really glad I did this. Other speakers included an  FBI agent , a  Fireman , a  Cop , an  Account representative  for Levi's (Docker's department), a  Sushi chef , a  hair stylist  and a  photographer  (!!) I  know ! How'd  my  silly a** get in there with  that  lineup?? It was also very  adorable that some of the kids who were in my sessions waved to me in the hallway when I was leaving. Yay!    Got the  check in  from  Pretty Boy  this morning. About time, too! What with the   IPO   and everything I was beginning to wonder if he wasn't gonna start  frontin'  and whatnot -- you know, forgettin' the little people...! But nope. He's just busy  datin'/working . Good to hear he's happy/doing well. Getting together may happen at some point next week -- which would be an interesting study in  "keeping hands to selves"   but we shall see what we shall see. Maybe we can "just be friends" for awhile and see how that goes.... ;-]    Also had lunch with  Travelin' Man  yesterday which was very much fun. Truly a  gem  of a person. We're gonna go see something gorey on  Sunday  so any interim missing of his fabulous self will be short-term.   Aight. Here I am, getting back to work now. See. Here I go.... Working... Now.

       Victory is mine!  Ha! So,  kitten  = caught! I scooped her up and carted her scared little self off to the vet last night wherein she will hopefully get all fixed up and duly returned to me this eve none (mostly) the worse for wear. Front neighbor is re-doing the eintire porch area with tongue and groove slats which is just COOL! (I think i have a wood-fetish) ... Let's see. Nothing new to report really. I'm officially "desparate" but that's not really  news  to anyone.  (although, I'm equally attached to my new  drama-free celibate lifestyle  so it's not so much   desparation   as it is wanting to get  really close  to peope I already like. I would not, for instance, welcome with open arms the advances of some  random individual  who might call out to me on the street, say....) I'm lunching today with the ever-cool  Travelin' Man  which should be  extra nice  cause I haven't seen him in a little bit. I was just in a meeting from which I emerged with  Chicken Noodle soup  which is just cool pretty much anyway you look at it! Heard from  Caseworker  that  Kid 2's Caseworker  has assured him that this is not all some   cruel joke   so  meetings  will be set up which is also pretty cool. I think that it from me for now though. I'm just kind of happy contented n stuff. Hope ya'all are the same.

      I want  kisses . I want kisses from a grown-up who has been thinking about my lips for awhile and who, while acknowledging that they are useful for a   whole variety of acts   up to and including spewing  witty rejoinders  like nobodies bidness, also thinks it would be cool if they stopped yapping long enough to allow for the kind of  intense smooching  typically reserved for  veterans  returning from overseas.

       Outwitted by a cat  A kitten actually. Do me a favor. Review the following statistics and give me  Your  odds on who  should  have emerged victorious vis a vis the match-up last night...   Me:  Human. Above average IQ. 36 years on this planet. Backed up by 50 years cat-trap making technology and a can of fresh tuna.   Cat in question:  Kitten. Probably about 6 months old. Brain the size of a smallish apple. Plays with bugs.  So, I failed entirely to catch that  stupid animal  last night (plus it was dark and I was tired {whine}) so I'm sitting out there again tonight hoping to entice aforementioned animal into the nice scary wire house I've set up to imprison it so I can take it to the vet and have it cut apart and sewn back together. hmmmmmmm. I'm beginning to see the rationale for it maybe not wanting to get caught...   Dumb cat.

       Not for the weak!  Hello all! How were our collective weekends? Great! Mine was fabulous as well. Well, kind of. Sat. was great. Sundee morning was fine (we went to pick up a  cat trap  to try to "collect" this  feral kitten  who is in need of some  fixing  and we went to get the trap from the lady who gave us our  house kitties  and who -- after "mothering" maybe  200  or so cats during her lifetime, STILL goes on and on and on about my charcoal kitty,  Igor . I mean, he's a great cat and all but sheesh...! anyways. She's great and nice and  Boo   loved  the fact that our cats have a "Grandma") but then I decided to do a  semester's worth  of  laundry  after which I decided to "clean" (aka move piles of crap from one spot in the house to another) which ended with both me and the child very  cranky  and  annoyed  with one another. The final straw came after we had spent about  twenty minutes  arguing about whether or not we should get rid of our computer monitor (CPUs going to my mom and I want to put the laptop in it's place but  Boo  is, for some reason, inordinately attached to the idea that the monitor must stay. I have  no  idea what's up with that but anyway.....) then I said "I don't want to talk about it anymore." Then she said "Well, I Do!" which I have NEVER heard come out of her before and which caused me to stare at her "in a mean way" [she says. I think it was more of a "frustrated" way but whatever....] which made her flounce off to her room. When I went in to look at her she started crying and said it "felt like I didn't love her anymore." Which KILLS me so we sat in the  orange chair  and snuggled a bit while I triend to explain that while I wasn't always going to have patience with her I  was  always going to love her." to which she replied, snifling, "I wish you had patience too." {sigh} So, that's where we left it. This morning I went in to look at her adorable sleepy self and she woke up and smiled and said "Mommy, I'm glad you were pregnant with me." And I said "Why?" and she said "Because I like my life."  {dying!} And, just like that, it all became good again! (She also said, "I'm sorry I was cranky last night." but that was after I gave her a  cookie  so it probably only half counts. ;-])     In other news,  Bendy Girl  is of the opinion that I should call her. Conversation as follows:   BG:  You should call me.  Chick:  Why?  BG:  {grin, shrug} Just cause.   Keee-rist!  What is it about   girls  , Man??  Too late though. I have given myself to  celibacy  and there is a  VERY short list  of persons for whom I would renounce  mine noble pledge . [note to   urlLink Lyle's   people. Certain allowances are, of course, a given. Let him know that he's still free to call me whenever he's in the area.]

       Is it still "irony"...  If it's shown "edited for content" on network TV all chopped up to make room for  47 minutes  worth of commercials??   K. So, mistake #1 was thinking I could "just sit down for a minute and see what was on the tube." It's not  Tuesday  so I know my  urlLink favorite show  isn't going to be there. It's not   urlLink channel 9   so I know it's fairly likely going to be drivel but with a lead-in like  " King of the Hill "  and a few well-placed shots of  urlLink Rosario Dawson  -- well, let's just say I HAD to watch!    urlLink Josie and the Pussycats  . The movie. Edited for network TV. Ironic commentary on pop culture starring (among others) indie queen   urlLink Parker Posey   or   useless crap   that wasn't all that  outre  in the first place finally realizing it's ultimate ironic moment by sheer dint of being split apart and wrapped around ads for  painter's tape ,  Gatorade  and  classic Lays . I'm sorry folks. I tried. But not even  Rosario  could save this ship from going down! Mmmmmmmmmm....   Rosario Dawson   going down......

Dispatcher:  O.K. We can do that for you. Name?  Me:   Chick .  Magnet .  Dispatcher:   Chick ...  Magnet ... wait, I know that name. You have a daughter named "Boo"?  Me:  Yup. { ???! }  Dispatcher:  I'm  Ex-Girlfriend's  sister.  Me:  Oh! Well... Hi! Um, how are  you  doing?  Dispatcher:  Good.   Me:  Great!   Weird.

       Five Days and counting...  Right. So, it has been  five  days since I've been  without a crush object  and it may just be me but somehow the sky seems a little less bright today... Could be the  fog  and  low-hanging clouds  but I'd really prefer to think it's all about me and my particular needs.   Poor  Miss Bee  had an  horrendous  evening last night trying to deal with this lemon of a car I foisted upon her. I'll spare you the gorey details, let's just say things didn't go exactly as well as they perhaps should have and not only does  Miss Bee  deserve a warm hug for not completely losing it immediatley upon realizing that she wouldn't be getting all the way back to her wife and thirteen babies any time soon --  Mr. Travelin' Man  ALSO deserves a HUGE shout out for braving the wilds of inter-city traffic and lending a hand! Yay! to both of you. We wuv. I am sorry my car crapped out so early in the game. I'll see what my people can do vis a vis getting your  loaner chariot  fixed so that you can once again be on your merry way!

       Everything's fine.  Sunday was fun. Marching was great. I liked being out and the kids behaved  amazingly .  CP  and her lovely  SO  chipped in with an  impromptu assist  so the actual parade part went remarkably smooth.... Not sure what else to write. I could say lots, I guess but I'm tired.  (Gosh, ever since my  BBQ  told me she'd been  fooling around  reading  other people's blogs  I've been thinking I need to get in here and write something  exciting  and  fun . Something  new  and  different , you know, keep that  energy  we used to feel alive... but, right now, I'm exhausted. Plus, I have a headache.)   Is this what   Lesbian Blog-death   looks like?

       I'm here...  I'm a mom, I'm tired. Get used to it! So, I'm not out as an  dyke  tonight. I  tried . I really did but after a full morning/early afternoon meeting with  caseworkers , attending  AcroSports  classes and browsing  Haight St.  rummage offerings (followed by  45 minutes  of driving around the  Mission  looking for parking) I glanced over at my two  sleeping babies  and realized that it was more important to me that they continue to sleep than it was for us to join that  glorious sisterhood  known as the  Dyke March ! I figure 1) they'll do just just fine without me, 2) I'd probably get  really sick  of telling all those peeps I only run into once a year at this particular event the history of my suddenly being with two childs and 3) I don't really need reminding re: the sheer numbers of dykes in the world who aren't even really considering having sex with me right now.   So, instead took the babies to the children's park at Lake Merritt where swinging happened, faces were painted and babies got supper. All in all a vastly superior evening I must say!  Except for this one thing. K. so I know I need to get used to this kind of thing but still....   Lady who was painting  Boo's  face kept telling her she was beautiful (which, as we all know, she is!) thing is after she finished she glances at  Spark  and says "She's yours too?" I say "Yup!" She says "they look different." I say "They are different." She continues to stare at my  Spark  with a non-smiling, kinda  perplexed  look on her face. I say (and I'm kicking myself now that I didn't just leave it...) "She's adopted." Face clears up. "Oh!" she says "Well, congratulations. But she's your  real  daughter right?" with nod at Boo. "They're both my real daughters!" (SHOULD have said.) "Yup." (actually said. Then walked away with painted Boo feeling weird so promptly started this inappropriate conversation with my up until then quite happy/oblivious child)   Me: "So, when stuff like that happens it makes me sad for Spark."  UUTQH/OC: Why?  Me: Because she's me "real" child too.  UUTQH/OC: So....  Me: Well, that lady was saying that you're really pretty and by NOT saying that you guys are alike she's sort of implying that  Spark   isn't ....  UUTQH/OC: is she?  Me: Pretty?  UUTQH/OC: Yeah.  Me: Of course!  UUTQH/OC: As pretty as me?  Me: Um... differently pretty. I mean, you're REALLY pretty  UUTQH/OC: [sad]...  Me: Honey? What's up?  UUTQH/OC: [very sad] She's already cuter than me, now she has to be prettier too  Me: No!  UUTQH/OC: ...  Me: That's not what I'm saying! You're beautiful!  UUTQH/OC: But you got sad because that lady liked me.  Me: No! That's not what I'm saying...  UUTQH/OC: [blinking away tears] then why are you sad?  Me: I'm not! I'm just.... I'm sorry.  I suck.  Anyway. Tomorrow I'll be out and proud. Tonight, I'm just trying to not  completely suck  as a parent.

       Whew!  Took the babies down to  San Jose  yesterday to indulge in some quality JC Penny photographic moments with  Foster Grandma  et al. Have I mentioned that  Ex Foster Mom  is GREAT! Well, she is. Very admirable. She's going to make a  stellar  grandmotherly addition to the family! Anyways, fun in a "mall" kind of way but EGG-sausting! Kind of glad to be back at work actually. Ha! Show of hands for those of you who NEVER thought they'd hear that come out of my mouth! K. In other news, I'm not allowed to like my  Pretend Girlfriend  anymore which makes me less than ecstatic but whatever. Life happens. -- or rather I can  like  her all I want but I'm not allowed to wish/talk about/try to finagle her into liking me back so.... applications are now being accepted for a  new full-time crush object . Must be vivacious, drop-dead adorable, at LEAST  32 years of age  and able to make me fall over laughing even if I entered the conversation  pratically suicidal .  Especially  if I entered the conversation suicidal. Liking of babies is a plus as is O.K. ness with irrational assumptions of ownership on my part and the occassional need to deliver the exact same advice  over  and  over  and  over  irregardless of my ever adhering to it. Line forms to the left people. Photo not necessary but short stories would be nice!   Also, in light of me and my  PG's  new imaginary relationship, I will henceforth refer to her as "Ole Green Eyes" a la Chachi from Happy Days. Cheers!

       Conversations...   Boo:  I can't do whatever I want. I have to listen to you.  Me:  You  can  do whatever you want. The only reason you have to listen to me right now is because I'm supposed to be making sure you don't get hurt. I've been alive longer than you so I know more about not getting hurt than you do so you should listen to me until you're old enough to have figured it out.  Boo:  How old?  Me:  46.  Boo:  No! How about 18?  Me:  O.K.  Boo:  17?  Me:  No!     Dirty Boy:  So, what are you going to do about your life?  Me:  What about my life? My life is great!  Dirty Boy:  I mean the "adult" part  Me:  What "adult" part?  Dirty Boy:  {smug silence}...  Me:  Shut up!     Random Stranger:  How old are your babies?  Me:  Six and one and a half.  Random Stranger:  And when's the other one due?  Me:  ...?  Random Stranger: {with meaningful glance at my tummy -- smile} How many months are you?  Me: {scowl} I'm not  any  months.     Sparkle:  Bahbahbahbah!!  Me: {absentmindedly - picking up dirty clothes} Really!  Sparkle:  Mahtoblhhhhpppp!  Me: {absentmindedly  - picking up toys} You don't say....  Sparkle: {looking at Boo's videos} Movie!  Me: {suddenly paying attention - amazed} You want to watch a movie?  Sparkle:  Yeah!     Me: {getting dressed} ...  Boo: {delighted} Yay! You look like a teen-ager!  Me: {nonplussed - entirely unsure where to go with that} My clothes?  Boo:  Uh huh.  Me:  Is that good?  Boo:  I guess.  Me:  Should I change?  Boo:  No. You can be my big sister.  Me:  Got it. Who's going to be your mom?  Boo: {shrug} I don't really need one do I?

       The horror...!   I have just been informed by   urlLink Bazaar   that "dishelved hippy","maxi-coats", and "pink as a 'statement'" are out. Damn. I was  this  close to being cutting edge!  K. now, let's see where were we... Took  Miss Sparkle  to the Doctor on Wed. so they could check her "pincer grasp" and get me all worried about her apparent "lack of it." Whatever. I have a   huge issue   with medical peeps (however well-meaning) attempting to quantify/evaluate  babies  and their development vis a vis agreed upon "stages." I mean on the one hand all the literature re: what kids are "supposed" to be doing in the  first  grade is all about reassuring caretakers that "children learn at different speeds and that some skills may be temporarily 'lost' as new ones develop." yet at the same time I'm supposed to get all  freaked out  and start searching for a  qualified physical therapist  all because my  13 month old  isn't (theorhetically -- the Dr. didn't actually have anything small for her to try to pick up) "pincing things"! Annoys me. Also, what is up with hospitals needing to take a  litre  of blood every every single time they see your kid? Sheesh. I loves me some  Oakland Children's Hospital  but I really can't stand the western medical profession.  In other child-related news, the  Boo  made me laugh so hard i swallowed my gum the other day when we were driving home. We'd just been having a super serious discussion about how someone can be your friend yet still not be very nice when she says (all serious face and quiet tone) "Mommy can I ask you a question?" "Sure Sweetie," I reply (with concerned frown) "You can ask me anything."  "Are you looking for free checking?" saith she. "Huh?" Saith me "or how about an iPod" she suggests reading the next billboard we pass.   This continues until I can't  even  stand it any longer and am about to die laughing then she sums up by glancing at an advert for the newest BMW and announcing "It's just another Toyota!" {sigh, wipe eye} I love that kid.  Not really much else going on. Both childrens are responding well to their new day watching.  Miss Sparkle  will be starting to go from 8am-3pm on Mondee and if all continues to go well, she'll be in full-time as of week after next and I'll be back in the trenches (which I've surprisingly missed of late) trying to meet some serious deadlines/prove some key people didn't make one freaking horrible mistake by every thinking I was in any way qualified to do anything.  Oh! Saw my  PG  on Thursday which was GREAT although she made me feel guilty by inquiring whether or not I've spoken to  Pretty Boy  lately. Nope. I suck. Which reminded me that I've also not called my  BBQ  in about a year and a half either and while I  could possibly  continue living should  Mr. Boy  decide he never wanted to speak to me ever again (not really), I will  never  be over requiring the constant attention/guidance doled out by the ever-sweet  Best Buddy Q  meaning, of course, that at the very least I'm gonna have to get the hell over the "too busy" thing and give that gal a call!

      you know what's wierd? That a cat can totally understand that a baby is a baby and not only let itself be totally abused but will also get that the baby "doesn't mean it" and will continue to hang around it. One of my cat won't even stay in the house if  Sparkle  is awake but my  other  one lets himself be pulled, pinched,  slept on  and dragged around by his foot -- all without hissing, running away and/or scratching (inadvertant or otherwise). Sweet, because it's obvious  Spark   adores  him but wierd nonetheless...

       two things...  1) My balance is totally shot. Seriously, I keep almost falling over and am constantly dropping things. Could be total lack of sleep, could be all the drugs I did in the late eighties. I honestly don't know but it is COMPLETELY DISCONCERTING.  2)I have gone completely out of my head and am writing random stories to people pretending to be someone/somewhere else. hmmm. Pretty sure   urlLink Freud   would have something to say about that but I really can't think about it right now.   That's it. Going to go put away groceries now before driving into the city to attend an  training   without  the Baby (Miss Tail, you rock!). Quick show of hands -- who wants to be me right now? {sigh} Ah well, c'est la vie and all of that. G-ma always said "You can do  anything  for two weeks!" She never mentioned the state you'd end up in though once those two weeks were through. P'raps I will give her a call and inquire....

       Low-carb Coke??  Is there nothing sacred??!   K. So, moving on. Going on a camping trip to Yosemite with a One year old who you've only known for three weeks....? Not such a stellar idea. Inviting the Ex to go with? Priceless! Not that I didn't have a very fabulous time and not that I'm not grateful to the Mistah L-L crew for including us in their shin-dig but sheesh! A few things I realized from this particular excursion:  1) The single most traumatic sound in the entire universe is the whimpering sound of a Baby who hasn't had a nap in 13 hours and who FINALLY fell asleep an hour ago, who is  just  about to wake up screaming in a tent shared with a six year old and her other co-parent, in an otherwise crowded campsite, after everyone else in the valley has also finally gone to sleep.  2) The single most horrific realization vis a vis the aforementioned circumstance -- that the bottle/formula is "outside" in the "bear locker" (lest they smell the sweetness and come investigating) and that the keys to the car are somewhere in the tent (possibly in CP's wadded up jeans) under the two other surprisingly still sleeping occupants.  Yup. These are the moments when you hope God realizes that all those things you said you'd do if the Baby would just  please  go back to sleep...? You were just kidding. Mostly.  Trip was not all horrible though.  Yosemite  is beautiful and it was hot and we found a stream/tiny beach that was amazing... Plus Mistah L-L and crew were wonderfully sweet and accomodating. I think it's just a matter of scale. Drive out was a bit too far, camping party was a bit too large, expectations for relaxation a bit too unrealitic, etc. etc. We're hoping to try again at the Russian River (45 minutes away) without the CP, with a bit more preparation vis a vis baby sleeping habits in unfamiliar places and with a modified  Mistah L-L  crew (meaning fewer people to annoy by having to constantly alter plans due to child readiness) sometime in July.      In other news,  both  little girls had their first days today.  Boo  is ensconced at an  Fabulous summer camp  wherein she will learn to swim! (Know what one of the best things about your kid starting summer camp is? Flirting with all the tanned and beautiful  24-something camp counselors  so they'll be  especially  nice to  your  child! What up  Jorge !)  Sparkle  spent her first hour-and-a-half at the  DayCare  she will be hopefully calling home for the  next 4 years  and she also did wonderfully. She was a teeny bit tired due to lack of morning nap plus week-end excitement but all in all she handled herself like a trooper! I was dispatched to a cafe to while away the time whilst she became "acclaimated" which was fun because I actually got to write some  real  letters/stories to some peeps. The kind with  paper  and  envelopes  and  stamps  and stuff! I know!! I'm being sent away tomorrow morning as well so I may just continue this writing rampage...!  {sigh} Right now though...I'm tired. I woke up at 5:00am on Sat. to get everything assembled and packed for the Yosemite trip. Didn't sleep Sat. night due to unhappy Baby-ness and bizarre half-sitting "sleeping" position which needed to be maintained all night so finally-sorta-sleeping Baby would not get joggled/re-awakened, and woke early this morn to get the troops ready to start their collective new adventures. Tonight, though...! Tonight, I sleep...!

       {Sigh}  I want all my days to be like this. Well. Minus the serious loss of "it" this morning when my baby decided she  didn't need any more sleep circa 5:30am/didn't want to be held/didn't want to be put down/woke up my big girl who thought it was funny that the baby was awake but needed to suddenly be held herself/and who wasn't particularly hungry either ... all on top of the fact that I stayed up late last night to finish this thing we have to post every  Friday  by noon but I didn't get it finished so I needed  Sparkle  to at least  pretend  she could exist without screaming for more than 15 minutes at a time. In the livingroom. While I worked in my bedroom. And her big sister ignored her to watch Sesame Street. Anyway.... Once all  that  was over we all went out for a little walk and had THE BEST TIME! I love Oakland! I love being out in the world with my beautiful babies! I love not getting all stressed out about everything. Seriously, once we moved  away from the madness  my world was perfect. I don't really think it's the new Baby per se that's making me a bit crazy I think it's the feeling that I'm doing things in the   wrong context  . Baby at work meetings/working at home when kids expect attention etc. just throws everything out of whack. But, it's all good right this second.  Big Sis  is perfect (and sweet and watching her  urlLink Totoro  movie -- thanks  TM !) and  Little One  is asleep. Soon I will be showering then I'll start getting ready for the mondo-huge camping trip we're taking with  Mistah L-L  this week-end! Whoo Hoo!

       and the word for today is...  Ineffectual! Man, I just got out of an "overview/status" meeting at work that kicked my ass! i mean, f***. The world is going to hell in a handbasket and for some reason it all feels like it's my fault. Or rather it's not specifically my fault but it's happening and I'm not there and so it feels like I should 1) at least  know   more than I do about it, 2) do something more than I am doing about it and/or failing that 3) at least be around to support the bastards who ARE there trying to sort things out.... {sigh} I mean, I get that I need to do this (aka bond with my new child) but it's hard not to feel responsible when crap happens in my department and people need me to decide things or assure them about things or make phone calls about things and I've got two kids in tow and fifteen minutes to spend on any given item... Plus, I'm tired. Blah.

      Now see...  that  is why I dont' like being annoyed with people. It's a waste of energy on the one hand and it makes me forget the truly  important stuff  (e.g. how very  splendid  it was to attend the  Boo's  graduation-from-the-first grade/pizza party!) Sigh. I just don't understand why people try -- actively  try  -- to make their lives as  dismal  and  pathetic  as possible then try to get you to buy into their stupid world view. I used to think they were weak. People like that. That they didn't have any backbone and couldn't stand up for themselves to something that was sensible. But the thing is, sometimes these people have TONS of backbone. Sometimes they're  incredibly  persistent and motivated and energentic. It just happens to be in a wrong, stupid, self-serving direction is all. What are you gonna do with that? Anyways. Went to see my  Butter-Boo  be a big girl first grader one last time which was GRAND! She's coming here tonight as well and we have all day tomorrow and Friday to hang out and play! Yay! I love that kid.

       Total hate...  Well, not really. There's this one lady though who hand-to-god I would schedule for extermination in a freaking heartbeat if I 1) had the authority and 2) heard that any other person needed any of the resources she's currently consuming, things like air, space, MY time.... Anyway. Baby's waking up but i just had to put that out there. Hope everyone else is doing swimmingly!

        Back to Hootchie...  So, I'm out doing some power walking the baby and I notice that (as tends to happen when one is out with an adorable child) sundry passer-by tend to chat us up quite a bit. Ar least they tend to chat her up. Me, they ignore. Which is annoying. "Hey!" I think. "I'm a person too!" but then at the same time whenever an passerby does look in my direction, perhaps with a raised eyebrow and a slight smile/"How YOU doin'?" Wink, wink I get all bristly "You can NOT seriously think I have the time/interest/energy to pay attention to you!" I think, all affronted dignity and  asexual Mommy-goddess pride . "Can you not see that I am with  my Baby ??!" Ha! I have no idea what the hell I want. Well, I  do  have some idea but she's busy helping tiny fauna grow into sustainable food options so it's not like she has a lot of time for outside pursuits. Plus she likes someone else. And even if she didn't, I'm fairly sure my lack of any kind of interesting life right now would send her running for the hills. Possibly not.  Unlike  myself, she actually has some  depth  to her so it's just possible she would be able to  appear  interested as I blather on about diapers, papers and missing items on our website. possibly by doing the times tables in her head. K. I've officially depressed myself. Moving on.     So, you wanna know how you can  really  bother a  whole bunch of people  out in the real world without really trying? Take your baby out without shoes or socks on. Now mind you,  Sparkle  is still in the stage where she's being carried everywhere so it's not like her feet are going to actually touch the cesspool that is the MUNI bus seat but still... The opinions! The glances! The outright hostility when I bring up the fact that she is more likely to catch "that flu that's going around" by touching the seatback with her hand then immediately chewing on her fist than she is by somehow absorbing it through the souls of her feet...! Anyway, it's an interesting case study. Someday I'll write a paper about it.    Going camping with  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  et al this week-end. I'm beginning to get very excited about it! First I need to be excited about the fact that tomorrow is  Boo's   last day  as a  First Grader  but following that, I'm sure the wave of camping with the babies and the buddies will crest...!  And, you know what? I'm going to stop there. I WAS going to go on about my chagrin at the replacement of my  urlLink favorite show  (even if it is reruns)with some bone-headed new  urlLink Surf-drama  but I'm not going to give THEM the satisfaction!

       Whodda thunk...  That a  child's naptime  would come to mean more to me than just about anything else in this vast world of ours! Anyways,   Big Sister party   yesterday was great!  Ms. Bee  is a  master  at child entertainment and i am grateful to the whole  B  clan for hosting this much-needed and hugely appreciated event! The ever special  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  photographed the whole shebang so pics will soon be available to those of you who are  particularly adept  at currying my favor. The rest of youse... sorry. One to a customer, please. Ha! Don't know where that came from, just thought I'd throw it out there. K. So. I've nothing really more to say other than I'm particularly happy the aforementioned event happened as it did. I could go on and on (and on) about the rest of my currently kinda  stressful yet still rewarding  life but I find that even I have a threshold for baby-related news. Maybe later. For now I will content myself with adjourning to the  sofa  where I will partake of a  frosty beverage  and attempt to dream up some   cutting-edge/holistic design   to show to our Web re-design crew that won't get me laughed out of the building. Ah... who am I kidding?? i'm just going to lie around thinking less than pure thoughts about my  PG  (who, I just found out has a dangerous "Kill Bill" side to her as well... well, maybe more of a "Pulp Fiction" side) until either the baby wakes up or  Ms. Bee  shows up with  her  little ones. Hmmmmm. Is this what it's like for other new parents or am I just taking lazy to entirely new heights?

       Mmmmmm. Sexxxxy...!  I have one cranky  child who needs a bath, one sleepy child who won't let me put her down and a half carton of spoiled Half and half in my refrigerator. I discovered the latter by dumping a bunch of the congealed mass into what was going to be my first cup of coffee. I am also covered in baby throw-up (luckily, my shirt has a large multicolored print so I think it'll blend right in.... Eventually...) Anyone who knows what i was thinking when i decided to do this, could they please take a moment to quickly sketch it all out on a napkin or something and send it to me. Soon, please. Thanks.

       In my defense, I would first like to say...  I've been  very  tired lately and i may have been giddy from the heat. So anyway, I'm down  South  dropping off  Kid 2  with  Ex-Foster Mom  sos they can hang out and engage in some quality reconnection action and I'm not due to pick up  Kid 1  from school for another coupla hours so, says I, "I think I'll stop by  urlLink Santana Row  just to see what a  real  Mall looks like" when lo and behold whom should I run into in the "Dress for Success" section of  Macy's  but my old friend  D.  whom I have not seen since our days of slinging donuts at the  urlLink afterhours  crowd over on Third and King! "Well!" saith she, all smiles and huggy arm squeezes "Long time no see! How's  Alaska Boy ?" "Good" says I. "I think. I haven't actually seen him in awhile." I notice that while we're chatting we're also walking. "uh, huh." she nods glancing at a rack of longish dresses and selecting one to add to the assortment currently draped over her arm. "Wedding." she explains. "Ex." she continues. "I have to look hot!" she winks. "Come help me pick." She clasps my arm and drags me into the dressing room. K. Now. Let me  just  say, I did  not  IN ANY WAY indicate that I had  any  interest in becoming part of this little excursion. Nor did I in ANY way expect that a  casual conversation  would end with me staring at an half-dressed (remarkably well-preserved) female as she adjusted her cleavage and demanded to know whether or not she looked "hot??"  I would  also  like to add that were my  Pretend Girlfriend  to just freakin' start  liking me back already  I may not have felt the need to just go along with the first big-haired lass who happened to invite me into her dressing-room and the following conversation might have been prevented. Eh hem. Anyway. I replied that "yes." she did in fact look "hot." To which she replied (in quite the flirtatious manner -- demure smile, eyelashing batting, the whole nine yards) "Really?"   Me:  Yup  Her:  {giggle} Cool. Hey. [turns back to me so I can unzip aformentioned "hot" dress] What happened with you and  Alaska Boy ? I thought you guys were gonna get married.  Me:  Uh. heh. No. [concentrating on zipper]  Her:  [with smile over shoulder] Find someone better?  Me:  Uh. Hah ha, uh... yeah. Um... kind of. Yeah. [concentrating on really very nice carpet pattern as she turns to face me holding dress up with one hand]  Her:  You have a kid though right?  Me:  Yeah. Two now actually.  Her:  Wow! That's great! he must be great!  Me:  Who?  Her:  Your husband...?  Me:  Uh...  Her:  Oh [hand flies to mouth, dress begins to slip] Sorry. I just assumed [sheepish smile]  Me:  Yeah. Actually, I'm co-parenting one with an Ex of mine and I'm single parent adopting the other.  Her:  [Nodding. dress still slipping] mmmmmmm  Me:  I'm Gay. [I DO NOT know where that came from. "I'm Gay." That's just... so.. GAY!] I mean... I... my Ex... Boo, my kid has two moms and the other one... the one we just got... she only has one. I mean... me... [needing to die]  Her:  Oh. [Continues to stare at me as dress pretty much becomes useless in terms of any sort of actual coverage.] Oh. [sort of shrug, shake thing then she notices that she's standing there in the ole bra and panty set -- A Set.   Soooo  San Jose Straight Girl! -- and begins to get dressed] So... um... well, I mean that's cool.  Me:  um hm. [not sure where to look. inching toward door]  Her:  [Picking up "hot" dress and  Gawd help me , winking again! with smile] So I guess you're qualified to judge...!  !!   So, there you have it. She says I should call her "next time I'm in town." Uh. Yeah.    In other news, my  Boo  about town had  Pajama Day  at school today which meant she got to wear her jammies all day long and can i JUST say she was/is A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E!!!! After school we went to meet up with a friend of hers whom she had made  dinner plans  with and along the way we collected  another  pal of hers who happened to see us walking by and demanded to be allowed to accompany us. Tell me again when my child became a grown-up??

       One more thing...  Well actually two. I forgot to mention that I stopped by ex-place-of-business  SNIFF  yesterday with the  Spark  in tow to introduce her to her  God Uncle L-L  and to say howdy to   my boyz   and I have got to say they were, are, and will no doubt continue to be the most phenomenal  set of mens-folk  I think I've ever laid mine eyes upon. I mean they, as a group are pretty darn cool but then they also individually manage to be completely stellar as well.  Tony  in particular is noteworthy mostly because he's approaching the big 3-0 which is just SAD but also because he holds claim to being the only boy I've ever met who can wake up in the morning, choose to wear a light cream-colored, pressed, snappy looking shirt and still have it look clean, pressed and snappy when  I  drop by late afternoon! That is unless he spontaneously changed during lunch but still... even 3.5 hours is a long time to go without spilling something. At least it is for me. Anyways... Also didn't have nearly enough time with  Sir James  and his crop of stories vis a vis the   French   which he compiled during his recent sojourn to that beautiful country -- in general I found chatting/catchup time to be lacking but it was very great seeing everyone again and now that I've assured myself they weren't only being nice to me so I'd approve their stupid screen designs I will be hitting them one and all up for lunch!    Thing 2 is that my  BBQ  is really very sweet. I don't know why she chooses to keep me around but I'm glad she does. That's all.

       I'm starving!  So, I'll keep this short. First a huge THANK-YOU to my good friend  Miss Bee  for offering to host a   Big Sister party   for my  Boo ! How much fun are we collectively going to have????? If, for some reason you're reading this and are finding yourself  surprised  to hear that such an event is happening because you've somehow not been alerted 1) check your e-mail, loser! and/or 2) er...um... see what had happened was.... K. nuff about that. I'll no doubt go on at length after the actual event occurs so I'll cut it short for now. Also, quick thank you to the  Miss Bee  for entertaining me and the Sparkle this morn and showing me her tomatoes (heh heh heh!) Such a quality gal! The teaching profession is about to be doubly blessed! {sigh} I'm hungry. I'm cranky too but I think that's tied directly to the hungry part so, I think i'm jest going to go and make myself a little sumptin' sumptin' and see if I can't kickstart a little of that ole house cleanin' sos the nice social worker types don't take  Sparkle  back type of action! Ciao for now!

       Marine World, Vallejo!  We spent the day at Marine World, Vallejo! celebrating one of the  Boo's  very best friend's birthday. During my time spent at that illustrious amusant park I learned three very important lessons:  1) You are  NEVER  too old to rock black lycra shorts!  2) Airbushed form-fitting tanktops look good on everybody!  and  3) You should never let the fact that you only have a quarter inch of hair stop you from sporting a festive headband!  I also had the following conversation with a very nice young man as we waited for our respective children to finish riding the Cobra for the fourth consecutive time:   Him:  My daughter...not this one... my other one, from my first marriage... she used to love this ride too.  Me:  Yeah. Second marriage?  Him:  Yeah.  Me:  How's it working out for ya?  Him:  good. I mean, I'm much more mellow anbout this one.  Me:  Yeah.... See, that's what I want.  Him:  What?  Me:  the second mariage. Except I don't want to have to go through the first one to get there, you know what I mean?  Him:  Yeah. [longish silence]  Me:  You know what. never mind.  Him:  {nodding sagely as our various children run up and begin to climb all over us} o.k.

       Today is a good day  I know! Not what you'd expect from someone whose BBQ has AGAIN up and left her for protracted lengths of time and whose other so-called friends (Mistah L-L!) have also deserted her in droves. But, it's all good. I understand that the road to total acceptance of your place in The Life of a Magnet does not always happen smoothly or immediately or even sometimes at all so I will instead simply rise above it and move on to other friend making pursuits!  Not sure why today was such a good day other than the fact that it's the third day of a week in which I expected to accomplish very little but in which I'm actually getting a great deal done. Part of that would have to do with the fact that God saw fit to give me a  great  Baby who is very patient as I drag her from meeting to meeting and essentially expect her to fall asleep on command so I can then work and the other part would be about having co-workers who are  on-it  as far as delivering the various bits I need them to deliver in a timely and courteous manner. And I ran into my beautiful Professor K by chance as well. She's still awesome and there's a 3% chance she will be teaching a class I'm taking in the Fall (fingers crossed -- hope, hope, hope!)   Plus , I get to see my  Big Girl  tonight (she and the  CP  are dropping by for a little impromptu photo-going-through and I am just  thrilled  at the fact that I get to see her essentially every single day this week!)  Hmmmmm. I think that's it though. Nothing new to report. Just general happy-happies. I'm trying to code a drop down menu right now and my brain got a cramp so I had to stop. I think I'm good now, though, so it's back to the mineshaft with me!

       Ah, me...  Tired right now but in remarkable spirits. The re-design I'm working on for work actually looks like it's going to be finished on schedule which is  shocking  and shouldn't be allowed to get out lest  design firms  around the globe  collapse inward upon themselves  from the weight of all that guilt!   K. I have my baby with me all week (Damn you  fabulous Daycare peeps  for actually expecting to be able to take time off!!) so I'm doing alot of "working in the morning while Baby has her nap, driving to work to attend meetings with child in tow -- although the offers to watch her from the co-work peeps are definitely pouring in and are mucho appreciato! -- then home in time for longer afternoon nap so I can work some more followed by early evening walk, supper, playtime and... more working after Spark goes to sleep!" Yay! Sigh. It's all good though. As always the accomodatingness of my working world is amazing to me so I've nothing to really complain about.   Part of my morning today consisted of going to watch my  used-to-be-afraid-of-the-water   Big Girl  not only  dive for a ring  but also  float on her back  AND voluntarily  get her face wet !! I know! I'm just going to have "Proud Mommy!" tatooed in  huge letters  across my forehead in order to adequately convey the immensity of all that I feel for my  Boo !  Heard from the big brother as well. It seems my nephew has just had his tonsils ripped from his five-year-old body but that all is currently well and he is doing fine. Poor little guy. Whilst he was on bedrest though mine nephew learned to play chess so I think it's pretty safe to say that we'll be seeing him at the Moscow World Championship delivering a much-needed spanking to the ever-weird  urlLink Bobby Fischer  either later this year or sometime early next...

        My heart, she is full!   My Baby has sooo many teeth! She came with eight but now she's got like  three  molars and four side teeth all pushing in at the same time! Remarkably enough, she doesn't seem particularly crabby about it. I'm spending all this coming week with her so p'raps I'll see a bit more moodiness but these last few days she's been jest fine. In other news, the children are coming home at the end of the month. There was a bit of drama wherein  certain people  thought that I'd ceased to love them (!!) -- suffice to say tears were shed, sulkiness happened but as with most things, after some stern advice and a good spanking, everything managed to work itself out.  Angel-baby , being the only  functional  one of the group is apparently going to stay out there a bit longer so he can get a better handle on the  Punk Cowboy scene /continue getting  laid  regularly but  DB  and  OG  are heading back to the land of promise, sunny skies and  moi . Couldn't be more thrilled. no really.  K. I'm actually just working right now so I should get back to it. Quick question: Why after all this time and a host change, do i still find   urlLink Steve   so hot??

       Enough  Let me just put an end to this right now. [Apologies to those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, BTW, and shame on those of you who do! Now, don't you feel awful that I'm having to take up valuable blog-space that could have been devoted to ramblings about my babies/crushes on random  aging song-stresses ??!]  K. You all need to get over it. I am  not , contrary to popular opinion, at all interested in either of you enough to make what would constitute an HUGE change in my life just to accomodate you and your silly drama -- have we not noticed that I JUST got another baby? That I'm working full-time? That the only girl I've realistically liked in ages while continuing to be adorable, is now essentially off-limits? I have other  things to think about  people!  Local  things! I am honestly sorry to hear that things are crappy out there (At the risk of sounding smug, I freaking told you they would be!) but, know what? they're crappy here sometimes too! Grow up. Deal with it. Do not think that I (in either my real or fictitious forms) can somehow get you out of it. You don't need to be out of it. You need to stop being immature about everything and learn to deal. Fer chrissakes, I hate that I sound so  old  about this but you all need to figure out what you want to be doing and start working toward something instead of making shit up and coasting on Daddy's Visa. I love you guys. I really do. but I'm also sort of invested in maintaining as  stress-free  an environment as possible and if you're just calling to give me grief then I'm going to stop answering the phone. [Those of you who know me and who know that I already don't answer the phone will, of course understand that that last bit was mainly for editorial "effect."]   (BTW,  DB  you are  completely  in the wrong on this one. Apologize immediately and stop being such a prick!)

       Apologies  So, I was making light of a situation earlier that I should not have been. Apologies to anyone whom I may have annoyed/offended/made sad. I didn't realize just how sucky living "the life" can be and I have to admit that sometimes I'm just so thoroughly insulated by my "overall happy/contentedness" that I forget that the world doesn't always appreciate/need my wry little commentary re: it. Sorry.

Miss Boo  has a sleep-over in San Jose but I'll be around.  Him:  Can I crash at your place?  Me:  Of course! You can meet the Baby.  Him:  {loooong pause} Oh. Right. I forgot about the baby.  Me:  Meaning??  Him:  Um... I guess she's probably too young to go to someone's house. Like for a sleepover or something, huh?   Ending one:    Me:  {offended} Damn Skippy! And she's a light sleeper  AND  I just got rid of all the  skanky-ass, cold-sore-inducing germology  you spread all over the place the  last  time I let your loser self "stay over!" Plus, you have a  girlfriend  now! Pig.   Ending two:    Me:  Um. let me make some calls...  Now I know what  Jesus  would do but what do the rest of you'all think?

       Hearts and kisses!  I love my friends. My beautiful  Dirty Boy  just called me from Austin&nbsp;to sing some  urlLink Toby Keith  song at me -- that boy is seriously going off the deep end. Ah well, he was cute once...   Then   Ms. Bee  checked in being all bright and chipper in spite of the fact that the lemon I keep insisting she drive is now  this  close to bursting into flames at a moment's notice! I like that girl. I like her family. They rock.   And finally,  Little Brother  just called to let me know that the rumours of him co-habitating in sin as it were with probably the only female either of those boys has ever dated that I thought was worthy, are, in fact, true. Yay!    I had a very nice  police officer  sign off my fix-it ticket today. (This has degenerated into  random musings  at this point so bear with me...) He got all annoyed that I even got the stupid thing in the first place. he was all "San Francisco cops! Why'd he even write the ticket. Damn waste of everybody's time! Free-thinking rabble-rousers!" It was all very cute. K. so. That's it. The world remains closed but at least I know that my little bubble is surrounded by lots of other friendly bubbles and that when push comes to shove it remains  all good .....

       Circle life  My kid informed me last night via phone that my "life is closed." We were discussing my plans to take down (finally. After a year and a half) a picture that my  Ex  had made for me representing the four of us (me, her, her kid and my kid) as a single unit. It's a great picture and my kid likes it -- which, in part, accounts for the delay in it's removal post-break-up&nbsp;-- but it says "Mi familia"&nbsp;which we currently are&nbsp;not so I'm replacing&nbsp; it with the new fancy 10X13 pic of me and my two girls all dressed up looking about as close to God-fearin' middle america as you can get (if you allow for the fact that 1) my hair is not as big as it should be, 2) I'm wearing far too little make-up and 3) my babies obviously originated from two "different daddies"... Actually, scratch that last one. By  New Mexico  standards DD's are pretty much par for the course. Anyway. New picture goes up, old picture comes down&nbsp;and I'm having a discussion with my big kid (who I  MISS ) about it all and she says, "Yeah, probably time to take that picture down. I don't think she was the right girl for you." Which is interesting/surprising on all sorts of levels but since I'm trying to be the  adult  in this relationship and since I'm TRYING not to take my dating advice from a six year old, I simply say "Hmm. Really?" Then the  Boo  says. "Besides, now you have  Sparkle . We're all done." "Done?" I inquire. "Yeah, we're closed. Like a circle. We don't need anyone else." Which, when you think about it is kind of sad while at the same time it's kind of nice. It's also kind of true. At least right now anyway....

       Punishment...  My kid who is  never  bad was bad yesterday. We were all quite clear that she was being bad. In fact we had the following conversation:  &nbsp;   Me:  Eat your food.   Boo:  Why?   Me:  Because you promised you would.   Boo:  So, if I don't then I'm breaking my promise?   Me:  Yes.   Boo:  And that's bad?   Me:  Yes.   Boo:  Am I going to get a punishment?   Me:  Are you not going to eat?   Boo:  Nope.   Me:  Then yes.  {silence}   Boo:  Like what kind of punishment?   Me:  I dunno yet.   Boo: &nbsp;A timeout?   Me:  No. I dunno. I don't think it should be a punishment just to punish. I think it should suit the "crime."   Boo:  What does that mean?   Me:  I mean it should have something to do with food and eating. Like you don't get any snacks before dinner and when you get your dinner you have to sit quietly and eat it, one bite after another for 15 minutes. No playing, no talking to me, no watching a movie.   Boo:  {thinking about it} Well, that seems fair.   Me:  Oh yeah? Well, you could avoid it by eating your lunch right now.   Boo:  No. I think I'll take the punishment.  &nbsp;  Then she spent a significant amount of time asking me if it was time yet for her punishment to start. Weird. She did very well though. She was, of course,  starving  by the time it came time to eat so it wasn't too hard to sit and shovel in the bites. After her time was up I said, "good job! now I want you to keep eating but you can relax a little too." She said "Well, actually, I put the pillow on the cat so maybe I should stay on punishment for longer." I lurv my kid!  &nbsp;  I lurv my other kid, too although I really am going to have to get some kind of a handle of the dealing with the wiggling. I get that she REALLY wants to be alot more mobile than she can be in her essentially not-yet-walking state but last night she had just been wiggling soooo much and being soooo impatient and fussy that (as I was trying to get through the door with her squirmy self&nbsp;plus a load of groceries) I just got exasperated and set her down on the porch whilst I popped inside to put down the bags. She, of course, promptly fell against the house and got a a very awful scrape on her cheek and a bump on her head. Nice. God, I suck at this parenting thing.  &nbsp;    Prayers and good wishes going out to  BBQ's special friend . I hope she feels/gets/stays better soon. Let me know if there's anything one so removed from the situation as myself can do to assist.  &nbsp;

       Whoo Hoo!  Guess whose  baby girl   just  took five beautiful not-holding-onto-a-damn-thing steps toward her shocked yet delighted mom?? Go ahead, guess...! That's right! My  Spark  has officially  walked ! Well, toddled. Genius, I tell you! that girl is so obviously destined for great things!!  Quick  side note/happy warm thoughts  go out to  Travelin' Man  who just stopped by to be sweet at me cause he heard/read/intuited (don't want to go assuming anybody still reads this -- are there "stages" of blogging? Do we first assume that only a very select audience is reading us, then move into assuming that everyone in the world is visiting, before finally realizing that, in fact, noone is all that interested...? hmmmm.)  TM , you are one of the sweetest boys I know (by far the sweetest  man  I know!) Thanks for lookin out.  Whoo Hoo! Now in addition to a   Toddler  , I have  three  more DVDs to peruse at my leisure. Which brings the house total to four. So, how many do I have to have before I have a "library"...?

       Victory! (I think...)   K. So I suppose  THE  news would be that the Senate in a "stunning" 50-48 decision ruled against ammending the freaking constitution to make it so human beings of a specific flavor couldn't register for matching towels/sterling silver salad tongs.  urlLink Here's  a paragraph on the decision. Here's where you can see how   urlLink your   "representative" voted (Angel!!) Whew. A little amazed that this particular vote came up at all given the need to focus on, oh, I don't know, education, an aging population, the recession and the WAR but whatever floats thier boat. Nice to know my tax dollars are going toward crafting and supporting good, solid, effective initiatives!  Anyway. in other news, I'm sick. Sick of seeing Halle Berry on those stupid Catwoman posters! Ha! Sorry. Seriously. I am actually sick. I think I've managed to trace this particular lineage of cold to this one  formerly  very nice, considerate, somewhat attractive person who showed up at my BBQ's birthday bash with her entire sick family in tow -- given that there were 92 additional babies/children at the party and at least 10 stressed out adults I suspect the cold we all caught on that day will have worked it's way around the free world by mid-august. Again, seriously, not to be mean or anything, but if  I'm  dying and  my baby's  dying my first thought would probably be "Let's stay AWAY from a gathering involving every single person I hold dear and their kids." Again, just sayin...  I am also sick of Halle Berry as Catwoman. (I'm not even going to link to the various sites I'm so discusted.) I actually heard someone call a radio station, equally annoyed, to complain "I mean, seriously,   urlLink Michelle Pfeiffer   was the  original  cat woman!"  First, props to Ms. Pfeiffer, she is a woman amoung women and she more than did justice to the  urlLink latex  but I think we all would do well to collectively remember that those hallowed boots were shown the meaning of  strut  by none other than the fabulous  urlLink Eartha Kitt  in Season #2 of Batman -- circa 1967. (Yeah, I know  urlLink Julie Newmar  came first but Eartha Kitt IMO freaking  defined  that character! Wanna make something of it?? What?!)     Come on people. Look at  urlLink her !   urlLink This  vs.  urlLink this ....   Not that I'm a Halle hater, the girl's just not sexy. She's pretty. At times she's even beautiful but sexy...? Like  urlLink this  sexy...?! fraid not.

       Alrighty then!  I bow to the will of my reading public -- for the record, I CAN'T just go back to the old design. Stupid Blogger templates erased it when I changed it over and it was almost completely customized so... Just not enough time/energy/reason to try to make it again. -- let's just live with this new design a little and see if we all make it out alive.  News: not much really. week-end is going well. Had a great day with the kids yesterday.  Miss Tail  dropped by this morn for a visit which was grand! Got to unload a bunch of stuff I've been thinking lately re:  CP  and  Boo  watchage and everything and I think the whole exasperating situation may just end up turning out o.k. (seriously, a win-win for everyone involved, I think.) At any rate stayed tuned for more info re: that. i'm not going to jabber on about it lest I jinx the whole thing so, for now, onto other topics...   Wanna hear something seriously disturbing? I was looking at the insides of my wrists the other day whilst the  Boo  was having her bath and she inquired what I was doing and I said, "nothing. just looking at my wrists." and she said "Why? Are you going to cut them?" !!!!!!! From a six year old. I am still shocked. She wouldn't tell me where she'd gotten that particular concept from either. I asked in what I thought was a fairly non-judgemental way what made her think of that in particular and she immediately got all weird and cagey on me. "Oh, no reason." quoth she. "I was...uh... just thinking about a  foot  and how you can step on something and get cut." Hmmmmmmm. Six years old.  First  grader. I'm scared of the world we've created sometimes.

       Ta-Da!  I've updated my look! What do we think? In so doing, however I've lost my links to interesting peeps/places so rest assured my angels, if you  were  there and you're not not, you will be baaach!! [If you could read that with a sort of  Guv-ner Schwartzenegar  voice that would be  great !]    So, my  truck  is now so  impossibly dirty  that not only are minds across the country boggling at the very idea  but  it is also almost impossible to get a decent reading on what its original even kinda color used to be. My house is filthy too. And let's not even get started on my clothing situation! Although, I do need to give a mondo-huge THANK-YOU to  BBQ  for letting me come over ad use her washing/drying apparatus so at least the  kids'  clothes are not sparking any federal investigations...!  Filth, filth, filth.  Speaking of which (kind of) I watched some  Canadian Tranny Pornography  film last night and I must say there are some REALLY beautiful Male to Female mostly pre-op transexuals out there in the land of the friendly Mounties. One lady in particular made me seriously consider renouncing mine homeland for good. I mean they're already treating us gay types more fairly, the air is cleaner, the politics seem less skarewed, now they have ta throw in some really quite beautiful MTF types???! I mean, seriously, on some level it's got to be illegal. She was doing all her trash talk in French too. Very cute. BUT the thing is, the reason I even bring this up is because I'm wondering about the audience for this particular movie. I mean they had Boys doing the "Girls"; they had them doing each other (and the Boys) and they even had them doing Bio-Chicks -- which would all make me think that the target is  MEN  - heterosexual ones with perhaps a bent leaning or two - but there was also this stab at sweetness and "plot-development" that smacks of Girly-oriented-films so I wonder.   I mean, the actors were being really  sweet  to each other. i know it sounds weird but there was this one scene where one of the MTF actors was quite clearly over being sawed in half by her current partner's  ENORMOUS member  so she sort of wiggles away and leaves. She just heads out of the scene! Then the guy she was with (somewhat surprised) jumps up and goes after her and sort of catches her and throws her onto a bed (they were being all smiley about it but it was obviously unscripted and she obviously was still not into him just then) and they're sort of rolling around but then she looks at him really seriously "not-in-the-mood!" and sudden cut to the next scene where he's with some Bio-Chick who he's pumping away at and our heroine is kind of sitting in a chair off to the side just watching. Interesting. Not to say that people in the porn industry don't treat each other very well/considerately, I've just never seen it in a film before.  Anyway, I'm probably jumping to a huge stereotypical generalization by assuming that just because they were sweet to each other (that wasn't the only part either. There was another couple who seemed  very  much in like with each other the female part of whom was being handled VERY gently -- albeit in a "hands behind the back" kind of way by her partner.) the movie may have been trying to give the ole nod to it's girl viewers and their "feelings" but... It was just interesting is all.

       Marin County Fair  O.K. so with a name like "Marin County Fair" I can expect that it will be, on some level, fairly expensive/annoying, yes? Yes. So, WHY am I surprised that it cost $6.00 to park, $12.00 per person to get in, $3.00 to go on the roller coaster (although all the other rides were supposedly free) $7.00 for a hot dog and french fries, $8.00 for some cheesy dolphin-balloon on a stick that the kids all wanted -- all for the opportunity to walk around in the heat moungst booths selling overpriced Ren Faire crap and cell phones. I did get to watch a bunch of full-face makeup,  extrememely  white women revive the ancient art of sword/belly dancing though, which  almost  made it worth it.   Plus we went with the annoying  uber-"globablly concious"  dad of  Miss Boo's  friend so there were the requisite speeches on why he wouldn't pay "good money" for ice cream that his kid wanted and that was probably produced by some starving farmers in Guatemala who were only making three cents a year -- this being the same individual who told me that he'd "considered adoption because of all the children that needed saving" in this country but then realized he couldn't because his wife explained to him he'd have to stop traveling so much so he could stay home and take care of them. Also the same guy who made us all wait for him to get a brochure for outside miniature hottubs before demanding that we all head over to the bandshell to take in the "Afro-Carribean" act which was going to be doing "drumming or something." Blah.

       First and foremost  Let me offer my profoundest best wishes and hopes for the absolute best-est year ever to my Best-est Buddy  ever , the fabulous  Ms. Q ! Having been one of the select few graced with an invitation to celebrate the arrival of another year in  Ms. Q's  stellar life I just  have  to say, there are few people in this world that can occupy one of the highest pedestals I've ever crafted and not simply maintain thier balance over the the somewhat rocky meanderings of more than a decades worth of tribulations but also actively perform tricks but one of those people is my  BBQ  -- who I just need to constantly thank for being in my life. Every day I get to continue knowing you makes me feel that much luckier than pretty much every other shmoe I see slogging through thier pathetic lives riding on BART in the mornings, so, again I thank you.  God. I am so out of it right now. I'm having to pretty much re-type every single sentence I attempt due to spelling errors, bad grammer and just plain obtuse sentiment so I think I will actually keep this kind of short. Just wanted to check in with a howdy ho and Happy Birth to the  BBQ , a HUGE I'm sorry to  Mistah L-L  for  completely flaking  out on him and  Sir James  tonight (I dunno, I am suddenly just really afraid of being around large crowds of people who are actively interested in watching things explode -- plus! I got TWO freaking tickets this week-end due to all the "increased police presence" out there! Dumb stuff too, like no front license plate and crossing the white line in the carpool lane. Really annoying.) Anyway. I'm going to crawl into bed now and pretend I'm safe and that everything that needs to be discussed in depth up here will be there for me to discuss in the morning. Hope you all are having a safe and healthy fourth. Nitey-night.

      "Intimate" things you could learn about me should my  bag  ("purse" to most everyone else but I like to pretend I'm not  that  femme!)ever decide to fall open and spread it's contents out for the world to see:  1) I have a baby -- or I just really like carrying around a spare diaper and some wipes.  2) I have an older child, too -- or, again, one might surmise that I keep a bag of  Cheerios  and a box of  apple juice  on hand just in case my blood sugar plumets suddenly without warning...  3) I am currently sporting or have had in the recent enough past to feel the need to tote around a tube of " Dr. Morgan's Cold Sore Relief Lip Balm ", a cold sore.   4) I am on or intend to soon be on the rag.  5) I am or soon will be sought by the law. Evidence: one assumed jury summons which is postmarked 5/13/2004 the envelope of which has not yet been opened and one unpaid parking ticket circa February 6th, 2004.  6) I am INSANELY busy up until October of this year after which either things slack off a bit or my various pens simply ran out of ink.  7) "Keith" is "cool!" -- I honestly do not remember who Keith is or why he is "cool!" but at some point we were close enough for me to scrawl this under what I'm assuming is his phone number on the back of a Santa Clara Medical Center business card.  8) I like  M&M s. Not enough to have finished the pack currently living in my bag but enough to have kept said pack around long enough for the candy inside it to have grown stale and powdery looking "just in case."  9) I have the cutest kids/associates in the world.   10) I couldn't take a decent ID picture to save my freaking life.  11) I go to  Mills  and am required to "check-in" at that fine institution this coming August.  12) I've recently returned from a visit to  Yosemite  where I camped in  Hogdon Meadows , space #44  and finally  13) I am  literate  enough to  subscribe  to the  urlLink Sun  magazine but obviously not  interested  enough to actually open/fold back any part of the magazine in an attempt at actually reading it.  Nice.

       Wow!  I've just been informed that the bank has raised the spending limit on my credit card to  $6,500.00 ! What for the love of Sweet Lord Bee-Jezus were they thinking???? Anyway. Just a little shocked is all. I'll be cutting up that particular card later on today....  Now then, I need someone to give me 950,000.00 so I can buy two run down but still   really very beautiful houses   that are sitting on a double lot next door to my kid's daycare just waiting to be renovated into the combined  12 units of communal bliss  that they are destined to become! What say folks, let's start our own housing Co-op!

       Tiny brothels...  Feeling a little like I'm running a miniature house of ill repute. I've invited one of  Boo's  friends over for a sleep over and they're not allowed in  Boo's  room (since  Spark  also sleeps in there and she goes to bed at 7:00pm -- I  thought  I could keep them entertained with  videos  and  cookies  but I was sadly mistaken...!) so, they're playing  dress-up  and in doing so have raided MY closet which basically means I have two tiny people trotting around in velvet slip dresses with cut-out designs, short satin kimonos and 5-inch red strappy sandles! I am simultaneously  horrified ,  captivated  and not just a little  curious  about the fact that the  seven year old  can maneuver in those things better than  I  can!

       Clarity doesn't necessarily make it better...  So, a good friend of mine just got dumped by thier siggie and I think that sucks. I think it sucks for a whole variety of reasons not just because the  GFOM  is a GREAT person who soooo doesn't enter into this kind of crap lightly and even moresooooo doesn't deserve getting in any way made to feel miserable about anything (ever!) but also because it occurred to me (in analyzing this -- as is my  wont  with things that really are  none of my business ) that even had this person been  clear  about their feelings and/or lack thereof my friend probably still would have gotten hurt. That bugs me. I want people to take it upon themselves to be clear in their intentions but I also want it to be enough that when a person  is  clear, that the other person picks up on the warning signals contained therein and scales thier emotional response accordingly (this is all theorhetical BTW -- I have  no  idea what actually happened within the confines of my Buddy's relationship...) But then I think "Is that even/ever possible?" Is it  desirable . In the first place, noone is  ever  able to be really clear about anything because noone knows what the hell they really want. In the second place, I've had people tell me flat out that they don't want me (never have, never will) and rather than taking that bit of info like the well-meant "back-off" it is intended to be, it just makes me want them more. So, I guess what I'm really saying is not that I want the world to be more forthcoming with/responsive to "clarity" in all it's incarnations -- I guess, I really just want a way to make it so the people I care about don't get hurt all the time. I'm also somehow guessing that  finding  and  beating up  all the transgressors is also pretty much out of the question...     In other news, the  Boo  told me an  off-color joke  last night which she learned from a friend of hers who is  seven . The joke involved a foreigner and his English teacher, an airport, a zoo and an infant. The punchline of this masterpiece was: "Take off ze-bra, Baby!" which she explained to me was funny because it was  French . {shakes head} I was and am, quite honestly at a loss.

       tired and old   Me=both. I just got through creating a profile just for the  Boo  on my laptop and I'm realizing that once I moved all her software and favorites off my partition and onto hers, all I had left was the boring crap...!  Shout out to  Mistah Lovah-Lovah  who is  FINALLY  back from whatever god-forsaken clime he was off to and who spent the last 48 hours flitting about like the society photographer he is taking  "snaps" for some movie that's maybe going to be at Sundance. Yes, folks, he's THAT talented -- it helps that he's also very accomodating and extraordinarily reasonable, price-wise! I'm going to have to get him to sign all the stuff he's given me quick before all the fame goes to his head!
