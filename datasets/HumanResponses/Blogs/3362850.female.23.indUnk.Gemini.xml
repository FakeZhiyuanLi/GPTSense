       urlLink    There are times when you wonder where is beauty?  During winter, everything turns dry, it is cold and it can begin to feel like everything is dead.  I struggled a lot when I moved to TX because I was used to the Southeast where it is always covered with trees and I was close to the ocean, but it is not the same in Texas at all (well at least my part of Texas) But then  I just realized that it just means I have to look for beauty a little harder and in different ways than I have seen before.  Because when you think about it, you can find beauty in anything if you are just willing to open your eyes and find it whether it be through a new friendship, a sunset, a child's laugh, a smile, seeing a butterfly go by!  This picture is one of the day's when I happened to be on a friend's land and looked over and was just reminded that when I least expect it, God provides the perfect picture of what I need when I need it!  The pictures He gives us can bring peace to the heart and comfort to the soul!  Isaiah 26:3 "You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because He trusts in you."  All that to say that as I trust in God, He continually reminds me of His steadfast nature and His continual goodness in everything!&nbsp; urlLink

      I just finished running for the first time in a couple months and was reminded how out of shape I am.  Which then reminded me of a verse .. 1 Corinthians 9:24 "Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?  Run in such a way that you may win."  We all know that we can't win a race if we are not prepared or conditioned or trained.  This just really made me think, "What am I working toward?"  In life, we all have to prepare ourselves for what may come although we may not be sure what is around the corner.  I truly want to pursue to live a godly life, in everything, and yet thinking about preparing for a race made me think of "Am I building into this relationship with God?" or am I just waiting for Him to speak to me and letting Him only pursue me?  That is not a right relationship.  A relationship is two sided.  This just allowed me to realize that my relationship with God has to be thriving so that I will even be able to model my life after Christ. So keep running and pressing on in everything!

      Joy is found in so many different forms!  I had the excitement of going to Jamaica for a mission trip with the youth group that I intern with in Texas!  We traveled to a mountainous region of Ochos Rios and did some presentations at schools, got to meet with the students and then got to travel to the infirmary, a Girls Home and a Children's Disabled home.  Each of these expereiences opened my eyes more and more to things we are not aware of in the here and now in America.  Our youth group is an amazing group of kids whose hearts for Jesus at such a young age just continually encourage me to press on!!  While I was in Jamaica, I not only saw the joy in the kids that we took, but also in the faces of the people that met us when we got there.  Whether we were at different schools in the area, at the infirmary, at the Children's Disabled home, at the Windsor Girls home, or just in the faces of the people who opened up their home to 30 strangers for a whole week.  The thing that I was most touched by was the recurring thought that Jesus was their only hope!  He was their life (Colossians 3:4)!  He was their everything! And you could tell by their words and just by the complete joy in their eyes! For those that I met that were believers - I was humbled at the fulfillment they had while at the same time having just what they needed to survive and some had not even been able to move for 10 years.  But yet, that is how we should be living - where it is recognizable that He is are ALL in ALL!!  I am also so thankful for the joy of the girls in the youth group that I get to meet with(disciple) - how exciting to share with other women the struggles of life - and be able to BE REAL with what is going on and yet be challenged to continue pressing on and holding to Truth rather than giving into the temptation to believe lies that the world tells us about ourselves.  God has called us to a higher purpose and I am so thankful for all the women who have discipled me and challenged me in my walk to hold to what the Bible says is true!! Whether it be dealing with relationships, future, job situations, friendships, just life, they share their objective opinion in love and repeat what the Bible says (repeat because I don't always get it the first time!)because of that I am able to receive it and respond to what they are saying with freedom that they see who I am, even in my sin, and show me the love of Jesus but yet share their honesty and therefore I then feel that I can respond to what they say with honesty.  I am so thankful for the women who have taught me so many Biblical truths and have lived them out themselves.  Their lives truly resemble that of Titus 2:3-5 whereas I was able to see women that respected their husbands and were pure, kind, godly women!! Seeing it lived out allows one to realize what a joy it is to live for Jesus!  Needless to say - there is some joy all around!!
