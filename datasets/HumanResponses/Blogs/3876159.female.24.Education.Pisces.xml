      How hard is it? Please answer me that...why? why is it so difficult to get it right. I get it right over and over and over again. If I can do it, it just makes you look really bad because anybody should.   I say, "I would like a double espresso with&nbsp;some cream and 2 (sometimes 3) equal."&nbsp; PERIOD. No secrets...no hidden agenda.. I promise I am not saying one thing and meaning another...THIS IS REALLY ALL I WANT.   I got it how I wanted it in Italy all the time. No questions or substitutes or misconceptions.&nbsp;  What do I get here at this wanna be cafe...a latte with a little espresso or an espresso with no sugar and definitely no sugar.&nbsp;   So what ...what did you say? If I like Italy so much ...what? Oh, why don't i just go back there? Oh, okay fine...I will...at least they can get a simple thing like a coffee right.&nbsp;

      Okay...so I heard before I even starting this great journey that the Italian mentality was tricky to get used to...   So at this point..don't forget that I haven't yet left...I must definitely, positively, 100% agree.&nbsp; They are unorganized and indefinite.&nbsp; and...I LOVE IT!!!   Here are some fantastic&nbsp;answers to questions some people in the group had...Fantastic!!!! (I will delete the boring ones)     2. Will the flat have linens/towels and kitchenware?    Yes, Usually BI flats have linens and kitchenware, but bring a towel just in case...     3. Will we have to share a room during the training and internship?    Yes, you will be sharing a room with another participant of the same age and sex. (or with your spouse, of course!!)     4. When do we find out where we have been assigned to teach?  &nbsp;   Does the school pay for the traveling expense?    10 days after the end of the in-house course in Saronno (so more or less at the end of September).&nbsp; The school may assist you for traveling expenses, especially if you are assigned to a school far from Milan.     5. What if my visa does not come in time?&nbsp; Or if there are complications?    Good question. Some of you are already experiencing the marvelous kindness of Italian Consulates (don't ask....).... yours will be the fourth session of the Teach in Italy programme, and so far no-one has ever been denied a visa... even if it has taken quite a lot of time to get it... As you know, British Institutes is a private institutution, and for this reason it is often discriminated against by consulates, who do not consider the fact that it has been accredited by the Italian Ministry of Education and that therefore it is authorised, like any other third-level institution (e.g. universities), to issue scholarships. So some of you will have to fight to get the visa (and the school with you, calling the consulates over and over again until they realise that they have to issue the visa), while some others will get it in only 2 days! It's absolutely illogical, but that's Italy....When you go to the consulate, please avoid using the word "work". Next year you will not be working for the BI, you will only participate in a TEFL programme which includes a 9 month internship....     6. Will we be completing the internship with our group members?    Not necessarily. You might be assigned to a school which is far from the other participants' schools.     7. Will we be working/teaching through the holidays?  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Will we be able to stay in the flat during Christmas time?      THIS ONE IS MY FAVORATE FACT OF THE DAY!!!!!!!!    During holidays, you will not be teaching. This means, roughly from Dec 24th to Jan 6th, and a week in Easter. During the break, you will still be able to stay in the flat. In total, it will make a month or so to discover Italy!     8. Will we have time off during the internship, i.e. long weekends, etc.?  &nbsp;   What is the work schedule like?       THIS IS MY OTHER FAVORATE FACT OF THE DAY!!!!!     You cannot teach for more than 20 hours a week. You will definitely have time off during long weekends (called "ponte" in Italian, which means "bridge", it you translate it literally!)   Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay  My, oh my what a wonderful day!  Plenty of sunshine heading my way  Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay  Mister Bluebird on my shoulder  It's the truth, it's actch'll  Ev'rything is satisfactch'll  Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay  Wonderful feeling, wonderful day!   The short little period between work and going home and working on this dumb assignment..which has a total of ZERO&nbsp;pages completed.   I'm off, Andiamo&nbsp;-- Ciao a tutti!!

      So the most important thing that I have learned from working here is how to talk to people and get what I want. I called the Italian Consulate in Dallas and straight away he said that I need to go to Houston. After asking a couple questions, it was understood that bottom line there was no other alternative.  So...okay...  I called him back and told him how far Houston was from OKC and that online it says that if I can't go then I can go to Dallas. So he thought about it for a second and said that I can call him next week to set up an appointment. So I said great. But will that be long enough time for them to process my visa? So after talking a little more he said that I could come down there this Wednesday and he will take care of everything for me.&nbsp;   So after talking a little more on the phone...all is well.&nbsp;   Fantastic!!!

      You're either in or you're out.&nbsp; You either get it or you don't.&nbsp; Last night was fabulous! And really really sad.&nbsp; My friend got married and had a reception last night.&nbsp; I just can't believe it...and honestly, don't really want to.&nbsp;   But all the Euros were there and to that I made my reference about getting it.&nbsp; You either fit in or you don't.&nbsp; And last night I realized once again that I do.&nbsp; It made me so excited to go.&nbsp; I got to practice a little Italian with George and Ida.&nbsp; But the dancing and singing and the European flair...it has been so missed.&nbsp; I miss hanging out with these guys.&nbsp; But one has&nbsp;moved to San Fran, another to&nbsp;Cincinatti.&nbsp; B. is probably moving to Kentucky.&nbsp; Why did we all have to grow up? I miss those days.&nbsp; Now we're&nbsp;all married with kids and steady jobs.&nbsp; Not really "we" but you know what I mean.&nbsp;   Anyway, the point I am trying to come across is that I am going to fit in fabulously over there and last night confirmed it.&nbsp; I am now excited!!&nbsp;

      FIRST OF ALL. Before I start my rant...Let me just get out of the way how grateful I am for everyone's help.&nbsp; From the really big stuff to the small, little stuff, I could not make this journey possible without the help you have provided.   However...   It's is funny what you come to realize in times of need.&nbsp; What I am about to say is merely an observation and is credible in no way.&nbsp; Here lately, getting ready for my trip and all, I have been in situations and circumstances that are making me vulnerable.&nbsp; I don't like to need anyone.&nbsp; I would like to think that I can do it by myself without help.&nbsp; I just don't want to put anyone out.&nbsp;   Anyway, it has been really surprising to&nbsp;me what people's reactions are.&nbsp; To get the&nbsp;closest people in my life to help me is like pulling teeth...I have to practically beg for their help.&nbsp; But outside of those people..Everyone is offering their assistance in any way that they can.   The only reason I am even bringing this up is because I am astounded how many people are offering to help me.&nbsp; From Europeans to old friends to just acquaintances...They all are making it really clear that they would love to help me in the special way that they can.&nbsp; And a lot have already done it.&nbsp;   Why? If nothing else than to figure out human behavior.&nbsp; Why are these people not wanting to even acknowledge that I am going?

      It's a toss up, but I think I will take Dallas.&nbsp; Thanks for your help and allowing me to see straight through my teary eyes.&nbsp; Dallas is still inconvenient and I will have to take off of work, but I am so thankful that it is not Houston.&nbsp; I would have driven there, balling the entire time. Throwing myself a pity party the whole way there and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Biggest Problem #1: Freaking out and loosing perspective.   Anyway a big thanks ;)   &nbsp;

      I think I have to go to Houston this weekend!!! The dumb italian consulate.&nbsp; I have to try to get a visa to go to Italy and I just received all the documents from the School I will be working for and now I just need to give them to the italian consulate.&nbsp;&nbsp; IN HOUSTON!!!!  I would like to call and ask them some questions...but they are only open from 9:30 to 12:30 -amazing!!!!!  I am literally freaking out right now. What about the garage sale? What about the research I was going to tackle? What about cleaning my car to sale? What about my freakin' sanity?   This whole thing is beginning to be a HUGE ordeal. I mean, i'm not an idiot. I knew I had a lot to do, but I am in gridlock at this point.&nbsp; I am sitting here with it all in front of me and I can't get any of it done because I don't know where to start.   I need a clone.&nbsp; At this point that whole issue with the embrio cell thing...i don't keep up..well anyway..not looking so bad right now.   GRRRRRRRR..i'm out....to scream or somthing.  &nbsp;

      Little Chinchillas are fabulous!!!&nbsp; They are sweet and soft and squishy and just love to hop around like like baby kangaroos.&nbsp; Who wouldn't want such a wonderful and entertaining pet?&nbsp;  ...... ..... ............ I just can't answer that b/c nobody in their right mind would turn down such a lovely animal. But he has.&nbsp; He changed his mind.&nbsp; I am crushed b/c it means that I have to give him away.&nbsp; Hopefully some small lonely child will want him.&nbsp; A child who can take care of him and feed him and and not kill him.&nbsp;  The best part was that&nbsp;I would get to have him back when I got back...  If anyone knows of someone who would love to have a fantastic little chinchilla named Winston....&nbsp;let me know.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Yea right, I didn't write this but did find it interesting to have.  &nbsp;    Milan    From the enchanted rooftop world of the Duomo, you can see the graceful porticoes and ornate friezes of medieval Milan fade into the sharp lines and angles of the modern city. It's a clear reminder that Milan isn't just a relic from the past. It's a bustling, forward-looking city whose fashion sense and robust economy drive northern Italy -- if not the entire country.  Often called the least Italian of the country's cities   (BOO),   Milan doesn't draw the tourists that tend to overrun Rome, Florence and Venice   (YEH!...darn you obtrusive tourists).   But once you've strolled its narrow downtown streets and visited its spacious suburban parks, we think you'll find its blend of old and new quite appealing. Yes, it's a big-business city, with hundreds of banks and corporate offices. But it also has plenty of attractions -- including its many-spired cathedral, a world-renowned opera house, the Galeria Vittorio Emanuele II (a soaring filigree structure of steel and glass that was the first indoor mall), and dozens of smart designer boutiques -- to keep you busy for a few days, if not a full week.      Milan Climate    Summer temperatures, which often extend into September, average in the 80s F/high 20s C but can feel warmer because of the humidity. Winter is cold, with little precipitation and temperatures usually in the 40s F/just below 10 C. Spring brings milder temperatures, as well as a lot of rain. The best time to visit Milan is in autumn   (Fabulous, just what I wanted to hear)  , when the weather is crisp, cool, sunny and breezy. But the city's heavy fog and smog can bring a gray day almost any time of year.      Milan Transportation    Central Milan is quite small, and most of it can be covered easily on foot. But if you prefer to spend time seeing the sights rather than walking, Milan's extensive transportation system is a convenient way to get from place to place.  Trams are fun, easy and inexpensive. Some of the old ones date from the early 1900s and add local color to the city. The heavily traveled subway system (or metro) is efficiently run and convenient. Most people will take the etro over any other type of transportation because it's faster. Milan also has an extensive bus system, which shares a ticketing system with both the trams and the metro. The metro operates 6 am-midnight, buses and trams 6 am-1 am.  Taxis are available but expensive and somewhat inconvenient. They only pick up passengers at designated stands and hotels unless they've been ordered by phone.

      I can't stand it!!!! Milan in 44 days!!&nbsp;Duomos and Operas&nbsp;( at Piazza della Scala)&nbsp;&nbsp;and Versace, Oh My!!&nbsp;Who knows how much longer I have in OKC because I may go to G-town for awhile to visit the parents.&nbsp; One thing is for sure....I am counting the days left at work.&nbsp; Lets see...18 more working days and 5 hours.&nbsp; I will be unemployed for about two weeks and I just can't wait.&nbsp; I haven't been unemployed since I was 12 years old.&nbsp; I am so ready.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I really don't have anything exciting to write about yet. I could gripe some more about all the stuff I have to do to get ready to go but...you cares. I don't even want to hear it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am starting to feel really scared and apprehensive at this point in time.&nbsp; I have met several people that are amazing that will be teaching with me, but I am leaving quite a bit here.&nbsp; Honestly, it will probably all be here when I get back, but still things and people and events will be truly missed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  (PS. Winston better be alive when I get back)  &nbsp;  I am really scared about selling my car. I have put it on auto trader and at high traffic areas such as people's work, but does any one have any suggestions as to how I can get rid of this thing?

      It is so sad to see you go...and just a little scary.&nbsp; A couple blocks from where I work lies a Popeyes.&nbsp; I had never eaten there until one day when I came across it on my way to Taco Bell or somthing.&nbsp; Ever since then, I eat there like every week (sometimes twice a week) and just rave about it to everyone.&nbsp; Yes, the demographics, not only around the joint but inside the joint, are a little less then safe...it really hasn't seemed to effect me in any way.&nbsp; Until today.&nbsp; I haven't been there in about two weeks or so and I went around the building as usual to pull&nbsp;up the the&nbsp;intercolm, &nbsp;except today the drive-thru menu was removed.&nbsp; I thought, "How strange" but continuing to be optimistic I sat in the drive thru for a second.&nbsp; Maybe they were just doing work on the sign, I thought.&nbsp; Then I decided how rude they were not to acknowledge my existence and began to pull around.&nbsp; As I drove past, I noticed that the place was vacant.&nbsp; Like a ghost town.&nbsp; There was a sign on the door but because I really didn't want to know why they were no longer in business, I kept driving.&nbsp; The thing about it was that it was always busy.&nbsp; So little is left up to the imagination.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Man, that really stinks. Thank goodness I won't be working here much longer. Sometimes knowing I was going to have Popeye's mild chicken strips with french fries just made my day.&nbsp; It is amazing how the little things in life cease to amaze.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Quelle domage (french for what a pity) to all you downtowners who can no longer eat at Popeye's.&nbsp;

      Don't you just love Fridays!!!&nbsp; The sun is shining, the birds are singing and the scent of two days off is in the air.&nbsp; The weekend is at my feet and the possibilities are endless. &nbsp; Ok, probably not really. I have to read this horrible text book and have procrastinated all week long.&nbsp; I have the best intentions to read it and I do. I get off work, eat some dinner and at about 7pm I hit the books.&nbsp; But then it is so so so dull that after a page I have to get something to drink.&nbsp; And then I come back to the book.&nbsp; After another page and a half and twenty pages of notes ( I am telling you, this has got to be the hardest thing I have ever read), I need a snowcone.&nbsp; And then I am hungry, and then I decide after two hours and three pages....I should probably start packing up stuff to go to G-town.&nbsp; And by midnight (or "mezzanotte" as my people like to say it) I think, I better get to bed so I can have a more productive day tomorrow.&nbsp; Of course, every day of this week was like that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am never going to get through this book.&nbsp; But by george!!! I am doing it this weekend if it kills me.&nbsp; I have to have a 6 page report on it by the end of this month :((. &nbsp; I better get to work. I have a great Friday ahead of me.&nbsp; Fridays at work are always fabulous.&nbsp; I am telling you...wanna motivate me? Give me a day off and I will work for you forever!! &nbsp; Happy Friday everyone!!!!!! &nbsp; Ciao a tutti!!!&nbsp;

      I think my Chinchilla may have found a prospective new home.  It will be a wonderful home for him to habitat in.  The only thing I worry about is that every other pet I have owned has been given to this person for some reason or another. Like my fish, Jonah and Noah, who were suppose to go over and just visit for the weekend...but they never came home and were given new names...something like Butch and Sundance.  That was upsetting.  Soon after the new owner killed them.  This brings up the idea... what kind of pet hotel are they keeping if they are going to kill dumb fish.   Next was my most precious pet.  Scout.  The most fabulous dog ever.  I saw him at Petsmart and just had to have him but couldn't because of my apt living.  So this person said that he would take little Scout home.  That was a great idea at first...but now I never get to see him and he is deprevied of seeing me. Scout is so sad about that.   So finally, if I give Winston to him..so many ideas come to mind.    I can't say too much.  I am truly grateful.  And who knows this person could decide at the last minute that they don't want to keep Winston.  I hope so though..I think this person may be the only person I know that would not try to kill him and make a pillow, a houseshoe, a coat, a small dinner, ...lets see, what else have I heard....out of his fat little body.

      Ok, so I have to read this intense text book, keep a journal, and start reading another book besides studing all the grammer that I learned in Jr. High, but of course, have forgotton. This intense text book is so over my head. Now, I have read a lot ...a lot..of books in my day and this one is by far the hardest thing I have ever read. I have read two chapters thus far and am not really sure what it said. I basically have to use a stupid dictionary just to read it. The book is about research and statistics and that is great and all, but the author debates different methodologies...common ...just get to findings or even the point.    I don't like a lot of fluff..just give it to me straight.   I am so glad today is Friday! I love Fridays for the sake of being Friday. I really wanted to go see that Anchorman movie tonight but it doesn't look like it is going to pan out. :( I just have to make sure and catch it before I leave.   Here is the list of things I have to do before I leave: 1. Winston the Chinchilla 2. Read boring text 3. Read other boring text 4. Review my grammer (Who knew I would really use that stuff) 5. Sell Car 6. Get insurance 7. Get out of Rent contract (This may be taken care of already) 8. Plane ticket 9. Get money to pay for plane ticket 10. Get loan diferred (at least file under another category so I don't have to pay interest) 11. Gargage Sell 12. Sell Computer 13. Apply for Visa 14. Learning Italian may be of some significance.  I know all this is so very interesting but I don't really care. It is interesting to me.

        Buongiorno a tutti!          Today is my last day at work. I am so excited b/c on Sunday night when everyone is going to bed early and dreading yet another monotonous work week...I WILL NOT be doing the same!!!! I will be working harder of course in the next two weeks to come then most people do at work, but I will be working for the good of Italy.           Just for Pete's sake...I may stay up really, really late on Sunday night...just because I can. I have had a job since I was...hum...12 years old. Most of the time I have had two jobs and there was a dark time in my life that I had to pick up a 3rd job. But starting Sunday....no today at 5:01 pm...I will be working NO jobs!!!!!! What freedom! What excitement! Sad to say, but I may be more excited...no...equally excited about not working as I am about going to Italia!!!!      Ciao a tutti!

      I am so excited and cannot believe that in a little over three weeks (3 weeks and 1 day) I will be in Italy. I still have so much to do before I leave. But the excitement motivates me and stirs a fire under my feet.     Garage Sale this Saturday...Whooo Hoooo!           I have been studying for my grammar test I have to take in Sept, but have a chat session this Sunday to quiz another teacher...it should be entertaining seeing that we both are procrastinating with our assignments. I have to come up with a syllabus and three lesson plans...okay, mom and dad.... LESSON PLANS ARE FUN!!!!  At least they are for me teaching English to Italian children. And on a side note....THANK YOU Mrs. Quesenbury for teaching French class so well...I am structuring my syllabus and games and such after her class. Hey, why re-invent the wheel?  Okay, that last sentence was no actually grammatically correct. But at least I know that right, no?  I think I am getting sick. That is just great. I study...my nose runs. I move around and try to pack stuff...my nose runs. I sit at the computer typing on my blog...my nose runs. IT NEVER STOPS. Where is it all coming from? Grossed out?  Reminder!!!: Gotta get a special birthday present before Sunday! Happy Birthday in advance if you read this!!!!!

      In all this hassle and bussle, I can't help but step by and take a second look at this whole thing. I just can't help but wonder...is it all worth it? I mean, as much money as I am having to borrow and as many people as I am putting out to help me in one way or another, I am not truly convinced at this was the best decision.  I mean, at the time I was completely convinced that this was the direction I was suppose to take my life and I said that once I commit to the decision, I must stick with it. But looking back and evaluating my decision, I have to wonder if I didn't want to go so bad that I MADE everything just fall into place...instead of just letting them happen, thus landing me in this very place in my life.  I never thought this would be easy but financially, I feel so ....like this was a mistake. If I pull out now, I will lose so much money and dignity. I really want to go. I think this will be the best thing I will ever do in all my lifetime. But I seriously sugar coated the financial end of the thing. I honestly and humbly believe that at the time the money was all going to work itself out...but it hasn't yet.  I am not totally inclined to throw in the towel just yet, but am having doubts that exceed all my expectations.  If it is meant to be that I go...all will fall into place.

      I know that I have written in awhile but I have just not felt up to it.  I have nothing to say that is of interest b/c I will just gripe and gripe. I have too much freakin stuff to do.   But on a side note...Before Sunset was so awesome. I really want to go back and watch Before Sunrise again.  I am so glad this fabulous movie was brought to my attention.   I wish I wasnt' so lazy. I wish I didn't procrastinate so much. My life would be considerable easier if I just did what needed to be done..and if it gets done early. Great. But no! I do my best work when I am stressed out and tired.  Like right now. What am I doing? I am procrastinating doing something at this very minute b/c I would rather ramble on and on about how I procrastinate than actually get up and do something.    I better go.   I promise once I leave this site will be the beez neez!!!! But now...now is not the time.
