       I checked my e-mail a couple mins ago and just got a forward from someone in my department saying to watch the news tonight because they will be reading the names all everyone who has died in Iraq. I am completly against the war and could go off about all that, but I don't want to right now. Right now, my heart is in my throat and I have tears in my eyes. My ex-girlfriend and I broke up last July. It was my choice and I it was definitally for the best. It was a little bit of a hard break up (not as bad as others I've had, but not easy). I haven't spoken to her since maybe August and have tried to move on.  I met her when I was living in Hawaii. She, like most lesbians in Hawaii, is in the military. I generally don't date military, but made an exception for her. We had a rocky relationship (though she will deny this) which ended me me begging her to date other people. Last time I talked to her she told me that she was supposed to go to Afgahnastan in Feb. I don't know if she ever went or what is going on. But based on the fact that they're trying to re-institute the draft, I think just about everyone is over there. I would e-mail her, but I don't want to make contact again. I'll write more about her later, but not right now. Even though I thought that I was over her, when I got that e-mail, my heart skipped a beat. I went down the list of names getting more pannicked as I got closer to the C's. She wasn't there (thank god). But, now I'm just anxious and upset. I want so badly to know where she is and if she's ok, but I don't know how to figure it out.  It's funny, relationships can be long passed and you can think you're over someone, but then someting happens, and all that emotion comes flooding back. All you want to know is are they ok, and are they happy.

       About six years ago I formed a mantra:   Reality is Irrelevant. It's only one's perception of reality that matters.    If you see something to be a certain way, does it matter how it really was? If you remember something with skewed details, will it ever make a difference? Is who we are based on how we perceive things to be, or is it on how they really are? So many times we rework events in our own minds so be able to deal with and accept them. If you tell yourself something often enough, does it becomes truth? So many times, I have fucked with my own memories and thoughts twisting them into my own personal "reality". But no matter how many times I tell myself something, there is something in the back of my mind saying it isn't right. Now I have grown, and I no longer live by my mantra (though I often recite it). I finally accept things for how they really are.   I no longer have anything to hide. This is me...

       It's quarter to 2 but I'm not tired so I figured I'd catch up my journal since I haven't written anything relavant in a while.  Though you may not think any of my entries are relavant.  They're probably not.  Anyway....   On Thurs I came to an ephany that I was either going to straighten my hair or cut it all off and get a "pixie" cut.  No I don't realy know what a pixie cut is exactly I'm just picturing something short enough that I can just scrunch and it's all good.  I'm not sure why I came to this decision.  I just looked in the mirror after lunch and thought "I'm going to remember having hair like this".  I finally decided on straightening it and then when I want it curly again I'll cut it super short.  Oh, Thurs I also spent the entire day with Elaine which should explain my earlier post on that day.  I could go on for pages, a novel really, but I think that this will be sufficient.   On Fri was the rehersal and the dinner.  At the dinner, Anne's now mother-in-law talked me out of my grand decision to straighten my hair.  Granted she was just a tad drunk, but she started going off about how beautiful I was, great bone structure, great coloring, great hair, great smile, ect....  (she listed about everything I could think of).  Oh, also for the next day everytime she introduced me to someone she'd say "this is Liz, isn't she beautiful?"  so then at the wedding everyone kept telling this repeatedly to my and my mother.  It's a huge self esteem boost, but kinda trippy.  Anyway, she said that everyone should embrace the features about themselves that make them unique.  We shouldn't try to cover them up or change them.  It is what makes us different that makes us beautiful.  So, yes my hair is big and poofie, but I love it and it's mine!!   Sat!!  Wedding Day!!  The wedding went perferctly.  My hair looked totally good.  It was big, but really pretty.  She curled it so there were big soft curls instead of ringlets and it was half up with two curls by my face.  The makeup was super thick but it looked good.  Well, unless you got too close then you were like "oh my god you look like a $10 whore".  But, the make up was ment for pictures.  That's the big thing, it doesn't have to look awesome in person, just in photos.  She put makup in places I've never thought of.  She had me look up then put it on the inside of my eyelid, you know, the part that touches your eye.  Yes, I can see the effect this particular technique has, but is it really that significant to warrent eyeliner touching your eye?  My makeup got started late and ran late.  I was 45 min late to the wedding site for the pre-wedding pictures.  One other bidesmaid was also, so we got changed faster than I think any bridesmaids have ever gotten ready for a wedding.  We got downstairs in just perfect timing.  The photographer was taking pics of each bridesmaid with Anne and it was just our turn.  I took this as a very good sign for the rest of the day.  And it came true.  Anne was so beautiful.  Actually everything was.  As for the technicallities, there were some planes from the nearby air show but nothing too loud.  In the middle of the ceremony a big butterfly flew over their heads.  It was really great.  The ONLY thing that went wrong the whole day was their car was 10 min late picking them up so they had to wait outside.  It sucked, but not a big deal.  For everything else going so well, it's a small thing.  That night the bridesmaids and groomsmen went out to dinner.  But that's it cause everyone was dead.  Oh, there was one girl who joined us that looked exactly like a real world road rules challenge girl, I thought it was her, but she had the wrong name.  I proceeded to go home and wash my face 10 times to get off the make up.  For the next day I kept finding remenents of eyeliner in the corners of my eye.  But this gives me faith in my eye's ability to expell toxins.   Sun, oh...that's today!!  Yeahee I'm almost caught up!!  I slept in...alot.  Drove home (SF).  My dad called me and totally pissed me off (we won't go there now).  I veggged out.  Took a nap.  Went to the concert with Kris and just got back.  Now that I'm  caught up I can tell you a little about Kris.   The concert was an experience.  I wouldn't say I had a good time, or a bad time.  It was an experience.  I think Kris and I were the only people there who didn't bring our pipe.  The whole place was like one big hot box.  I didn't know how to dance to the music so I did what everyone else did and closed my eyes and did the little boppy thing (I don't know how to describe it, but it consisted of some mild head banging).  It was the kind of music you feel in your chest, but don't really hear.  I was glad when they ended.  As for Kris.  I liked her alot, but now I'm not really feeling it anymore.  One thing is, she's an ex-drug adict.  I was wary, but I those two little letters make me give it a chance.  But tonight she mentioned having or having friends with mushroons, coke, lsd  and that's just what I can remember right now.  I'm a good girl.  I don't even smoke weed.  I don't want to.  The last time I did was in 2000 and there was a significant thing associated with that time.  Please don't make me do drugs.  Actually tonight I was seriously like "oh shit, if I get high, I'm gonna be pissed".  I know I sound like a total prude right now.  Watch, next week I'll be like "I got stoned tonight".  I get very flip-floppy about weed.  But other drugs are really just bad.  Well, even besides that I just wasn't feeling at ease.  It felt like the conversation was kinda hard.  Which is weird cause usually we talk alot.  I don't know.  fuck it.  back to square one.  i'm officially out of women.  i think i'm just gonna chill for a while.  appently i really suck at dating.  and i've officially (tonight is the night of official decisions) gone from worrying about to missing CC.  I'm sure i'll be ok soon, but i'm having some issues right now.   Damn, this posting is way too long, and my back is starting to hurt, and i am FINALLY tired.  So, it is OFFICALLY time for bed!~

       Damn, last night I could barely sleep (woke up every half hour) and it's not even me who's getting married.  I'm so excited for her.  I got out of bed a half hour early and feel totally rested just ancy.  It's wierd, I've been dragging all week.  I have to leave for my hair apt in like 5-10 min but didn't know what to do to kill that time.  I think this helped.

       I have to leave for the rehersal dinner in about an hour so I decided to waste some time.  I just finished a cup of instant coffee so my mouth has a bad after taste.  I'm starting at a cup of Parsley tea, but scared to take a sip.  Don't ask why I'm drinking Parsely tea.  Maybe I should strain it.  All the leaves are just floating around.  I'm gonna go strain it.  I guess this post is shorter than expected.

       Whenever I spend lots of time away from my family I miss them so much.  But then, when I do see them I remember why I limit my time.  I love them so much, but it's hard.  I'll be down here till Sat night.  I guess we'll see how it goes.  As for other news.  My car had issues...again.  This time it took $300 to fix.  Not cool.  I'm pretty short on money right now.  Especially with the Old Navy issue and now my car.  Oh, Old Navy called again the other day to get a survey.  I wish I was here to take the call so I could tell them to fuck off.  Last thing that's bugging me.  Ok, it's not the last thing that's pissing me off, just the last thing I'll mention right now.  I can't find the jewelry I want to wear on Sat.  I want to wear my Tiffany's necklace and the bracelet that Anne gave me for graduation.  I think I took them up to SF but I don't know where I put them.  When I was packing up my stuff for this weekend I couldn't find them and thought they'd be down here.  Nope.  I have backup jewelry but it's just not my first choice.  Plus I really need to find that stuff.  I know I put it in a safe place.  Why can I never remember where my "safe places" are?  Anyway, I'm gonna go chill for a bit.  The get together is in a few hours.  I'm not gonna dress up.  I think it'll be ok if I'm casual.

       13 more hours till my last final.  I'm annoyed that it's a 4 hour essay, but not too stressed about the content.  It should be a pretty easy problem, just the writting will be the trick.  I'm feeling kinda sick right now.  Not too sure why.  I think I over ate.  I had a late lunch then at a meeting today they had Indian food so I had a little (about 6).  So, I'm gonna skip a full dinner.  Today I realized that I'm kinda sensitive about Indian stuff.  The people at the meeting didn't know what anything was and kept calling everything by their own names.  "Do you want some crispy nibblets?"  I know that it's stupid, but it was really starting to annoy me.  I don't want to go into it cause I know it's over reacting, but it really annoyed me. Also, Ali sent me a good luck e-mail.  Let me see if I can insert it.  Nope, I can't insert it.  Oh well.  I'm not gonna respond.  When I talk to her next time I'll "break up" whatever it is this is.  On an up side I'm seeing this girl I REALLY like on Sun.  We're going to a concert.  We'll see how that goes.  As for Tyler, we haven't spoken in a few days.  Whatever.  On a different subject, I'm super excited about this weekend.  It's gonna be crazy till Monday, but It'll be fun.  Let's see...... Thurs:  1:30 - Pedicure, 8:00 - Anne's house for gifts    (Remember to press dress) Friday:  11:00 - Rehersal, 1:30 - Thingie, 6:00 - Rehersal Dinner Sat:  8:00 - Hair (Remember to confirm), 9:00 - Makeup, 10:00 -  Be at location, 12:00 - Wedding followed by reception Sun:  9:30 (or so) - Take Mom and Elaine to convention, 3:30 - Pick them up and go to late lunch, 7:00 (or so...still TBA) - Meet (anyone got a good name for her?  How about Kris) for dinner followed by concert.  Damn, next Tues is my roomate's B-day and she wants to have a party.  So I gotta worry about that too.  And call the manager to get a work time.  Ok, time for a good night's sleep so that I can kick ass on my essay tomorrow.  After all I am the smartest woman (no person) who has ever lived.  I know everything about everything.

       The purpose of creating this blog was for me to have a place to write about my thoughts and feelings.  Thus far I haven’t touched on anything that I intended to talk about.  I’ve been nervous because several of my friends read this.  I am happy that they do because I think that it will give them a better understanding of who I am, but I’m nervous at the same time.  The truth is that I no one really knows me.  It’s not their fault.  I, like my father, am a great actor.  I portray what I want.  I often slip and people will get snippets of my thoughts, but nothing cohesive enough for them to form a picture of who I am.  I often even try to hide this image from myself.  I am hoping that I can begin writing my thoughts here.  This is my place to talk about how I feel.  I don’t want anyone to read this and feel bad for me, or try to fix things, or minimize things.  And also, no matter how much I talk about something, what is written here is never the whole story.  In fact, I have not told the whole story about any event that has ever transpired in my life (except to my therapist).  I often twist and contrive things into a form that works.  No, I don’t lie or manipulate the truth in order to gain something in my interest.  On the contrary I change things in order to protect people from what may hurt them.  I love my friends dearly, but I don’t confide in them.  I don’t confide in anyone.  This is what has happened.  I never talked to people about problems I had.  In fact, I would often change a negative event into a positive one.  No, I wasn’t raped…we messed around.  No, he didn’t hurt me….he’s just playful.  I hide everything so meticulously that no one ever knew what was happening in my mind or otherwise.  None of my friends have ever seen me truly upset.  I temper my emotions before I allow them around my friends.  I think that I’m trying to protect them.  When I care for someone very deeply, I want to protect them from everything.  It’s the motherly thing.  A lot of times I slip and my bitterness or depression comes out, but they have never seen the brunt of it.  None of my friends have ever seen me go into a panic attack, they have never seen me go into a catatonic state.  The Gouch may have once, I’m not sure.  But, all this “protection” has resulted in no one knowing how to comfort me when I’m upset.  There is only one person who can make me feel better when I’m sad.  But even she hasn’t seen me when I’m truly upset.  I’m so scared to write about things because I don’t want some people knowing some things.  But, I do honestly think that it would be good for our relationship for my friends to understand me better.  I don’t want my emotions to be brushed off as “Oh, Liz…you’re just being you”.  This blog is not a competition or a “who has a worse life”.  This is about me.  Only me.  How I think and feel.  I think the biggest problem I have with talking to people when I’m upset about something is one of two things always happens.  Either you get someone who offers tons of advise on how to fix it, or you get someone who trivializes your problems and explains how they have it worse.  It is so hard to find someone who will just listen.  I just want to be mad/sad/ect…  I don’t want it fixed.  I just need to feel this way sometimes.  I don’t know if this posting makes much sense.  I ment it as an introduction so that I could now post some other things that I’ve been wanting to talk about.  But, I’m still nervous.  I love you all.  Please keep in mind that this is my diary.  It’s excess information about who I am.  Don’t form judgments about me.  And don’t criticize me or tell me to change.  I know that right now you’re thinking that I’m full of shit and a bitch for trivialize your understanding of me.  I do not mean to do that.  I feel like this posting did not do what it was intended to.  But, I’m not thinking too clear right now, so I’m going to leave it at this and do damage control later. I love you!!

       I was playing with my digital camera some more.  Yes, you're gonna keep seeing random ass pictures until I grow bored of it and find a new toy. I have some good, well not good but better, pics than these.  But, since this isn't her blog I think it's wrong for me to post a pic of her for all the world to see.  They will all then know that she does, in fact, associate with me.  So, here are some "artistic" ones.   urlLink    1&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    2&nbsp; urlLink

       I actually had a really good day yesterday and was planning on writing about it.  But, today I have settled into a sadness again.  There are two things which I can point to.  The first is another dream about CC.  Last night I had a dream of getting a list of names of people who were getting moved to the "front lines".  I don't even think they have a "front lines" anymore.  I think it's all radar shit.  But anyways, she was one it.  I can't help but cry.  For a min I tried to hold back and pull myself together, but I think it's good to feel sad sometimes.  I'm trying not to surpress my emotions so much anymore.  The second thing I'm upset about is my younger sister, Elaine.  I love her so much, but she's really dificult.  Today nothing big happened.  Nothing that would constitute any kind of mention or discussion.  I met my mom and Elaine for lunch.  She was really pleasent, only got pissed once and that was resolved quickly.  Well, maybe two or 3 times, but I'm so used to it, it's hard to remember.  Anyway, the only thing I'm sad about is that after lunch, my mom had to go to work for like an hour to check on something and I was going to go to the store really quick then go to my mom's house.  My sister went with my mom.  My sister always goes with my mom.  She's really clingy to her.  I know that and I accept it.  I just feel like I'm her sister and I don't see her nearly as often and she still always chooses to spend time with my mom.  I know that Elaine doesn't like me very much.  I know it and I accept it.  But it never ceizes to hurt me.  I don't know.  I heard once that you can never force the kind of relationship you want with someone.  You have to accept who they are and what kind of relationship is possible.  If you know my sister you understand.  Well, maybe you don't entirly, but you have an idea.      Well, I'm at my mom's house alone crying.  But, I have to pull my shit together before they get here.  So I better go.

       Ok, I'm in a MUCH better mood today!!  I finished my take home final.  I found my teacher as I was frantically running towards the office before the door slammed shut.  He held it for me then I told him never mind cause I was looking for him.  I gave him my final and he told me I should hold on to it cause it's not due till Tues.  But, NO THANK YOU!!  I have another class to worry about, I will not be looking at it again.  So, this means that I only have one more final to worry about.  And, I'm super psyched cause Anne's gift came in.  It wasn't supposed to be in till after the wedding and I was super dissappointed but i just got a call from the store today that it's in.  I'm extreamly tempted to dive down and get it today, but I'll wait till Sun.  Tomorrow I'm going rock climbing in the moring and a physics party at night and probably an art show in the middle somewhere.  It'll be a good weekend.  Oh, I talked to Tyler last night  I don't think I've mentioned her yet.  I think we're gonna go out soon.  She says Sun, but I'm gonna see, I think Wed would be better.  I have my final Wed morning, so I'll be ready to chill Wed night.  Then, Thurs I'm going down to my mom's house for a long weekend.  Thurs is a pedicure with my sister, friday is wedding festivities, and sat is the wedding.  I'm so excited!!  I honestly don't think i'd be more excited if it were my own wedding. Do you notice that my posting really are incohesive ramblings.  I will try to start being better, but no promises.

       Ok, I gave up and did laundry today.  Don't you always feel better after you have all clean clothes?  I'm annoyed with myself.  I forgot to eat again today.  I know I was hungry at like 2 and then totally forgot about it till like 8.  So, no I'm a bit icky.  You know how it is when you don't eat for a long time then get a meal.  Oh, I'm thinking of having a spoon of ice cream (i'm gonna be bad).  What else did I do today?  I plucked my eyebrows.  They were getting scarry.  Usually I make them thin, but I decided to keep them fuller this time.  Go me.  Oh, and those Old Navy people kept calling so I called them back and seriously bitched out the lady.  I'm gonna write a hate letter to them.  I think that this entry is completely pointless so I'll stop now.

       After over a half hour on the phone calling different numbers I finally figured out what the hell was going on.  They still had my Pacifica address.  And I, being the genius I am, never changed my address.  But Old Navy is still stupid.  The number they gave me to call back was some car dealership.  That's why it took me so long to find someone to fix it...oh Peggy!!  One hint, whenever you are on one of those automated directory things and can't talk to a real person, click the "open new account" option.  Those are the calls that get picked up first.  That's what I did, then proceided to yell at the poor guy cause the collection people are being mean.  So, he gave me a number to talk to them directly.  Peggy was nice, she reversed the fees.  So, I guess this is an ok start to the day.

       I figured I'd just give a little update of my day.  Yesterday I ended up screwing around so I didn't finish my paper till after midnight, then had to get up at 6:30 to put on the final touches.  I ended up feeling all sick.  Not sure if it was the lack of sleep, lack of food, stress, the beer, or the smoking.  Maybe a combo.  Oh ya, I'm smoking again.  Well, not really.  I'm not buying them, just bumming them.  I know, I'm going to be good.  I'm spending so much energy trying to get my Cholesterol down, so smoking is just so couter-productive.  I'm totally tired today.  It took 3 shots of expresso, 1 coffee, 1 ice tea, and half a caffinated chocolate bar to make it through the day.  But, classes are over!!  Oh, I had a presentatoin today.  It was quite possibly one of the worst I've given.  I answered nearly all the questions with "i don't know".  And, Anne is moving to Seattle in maybe a month.  I learned one thing about myself.  When I get sleep deprived, snack jingles get stuck in my head.  One time it was "I love the fishes cause they're so delicious" this time it's "i want candy (do do do do)".  Yes, that one phrase circling in my head for weeks.  What else.  Oh, a fucking collection agency is calling.  I guess I didn't pay my Old Navy card off.  I'm pissed cause I never got a statement and haven't shopped there in so long I have no clue what I owe.  I went to the website and it won't let me access my account cause they already sold it to the collection people.  Mother Fuckers!!  They're being complete assholes.  I've called them back 2x but no answer.  And finally, I'll give you one guess for who I had a dream about last night.  Damn, I need to get a grip.  I'm so glad I have my therapist tomorrow.  I think I'm getting too dependent on her though.  She'll be out of town for like 2 months.  I don't know.  I think you can tell I'm agitated.  So, lets end on a happy note.  Mass. just legalized gay marriage and Sweeden is going to allow tran in the olympics.  And, I just talked to my roomate, she's in a bad mood too so we're gonna get a bottle of wine and a movie.  I should be feeling better tonight.

       Ok, here's the girl update.  Ali - This bitch is pissing me off.  We met like a week ago and she's getting super scary.  She called me "babe" as in "how you doing babe" the other day.  Then she asked me to go on vacation with her.  And will call me like 5 times a day.  HELL NO!!  I do not need this.  She's all clingy and I don't even know her yet.  It's really freaking me out.  I've been avoiding her BIG time.  I'm debating whether to tell her I'm not interested or to just blow her off.  I know my sister would vote for the blow off.  Any opinions?  CC - My ex.  With the help of Red, I put together a care package for her that hopefully doesn't give the wrong idea.  It had a book (Runaway Jury), a foam football, hand held tetris, lip balm (of course), cookies, and lots of candy.  The card read (I had this approved by 3 people so I hope it's ok)  "CC, I want to let you know that I am thinking about you.  I hope that you are well, and (most importantly) you're happy.  Please take care of yourself.  -Liz-"  I was going for I care and she's in my thoughts but not too personal.  I'm nervous though.  I really do miss her and want to talk to her.  Yes, her photos are still on my dresser, but I had to put something over her face so I wouldn't see it.  I don't know.  The question in my mind right now is "do I still love her?"  On another topic.  I am REALLY nervous about sending the package.  She is so fragile.  When she found out I was moving back to Cali, she volunteered to go to Iraq early.  When I was out of town for 1 weekend she was so depressed she drank herself into the hospital.  It's not like I'm being irrational, it's a very real possibility that if I screw up and trigger the wrong emotion, she'll put herself in danger.  That's the last thing that needs to happen when she's over there.  I know it's not my responsibility.  That was one thing I was working on with my therapist this last week.  I know it's not my responsibility to fix things or take care of people.  But the question is, if you know that you have the power to help someone in need, isn't that automaticly turned into a responsibility.  I remember my last night with CC.  I was petrified about seeing her.  I've never seen someone so desprate when she's hurting.  Please god, let sending that package do good.  Please don't let it hurt her in any way.

       It seems like everyone is having a hard time right now.  There's so much that I feel I need to focus on and it's getting hard.  I love my friends so much and always want to be there for them.  My mom tells me that I can't take on their problems and/or responsibilities.  But, I can't help it.  I can't stand to see them hurt or having problems.  If I can do anything to help, I will.  The only problem comes when everyone is having issues at the same time.  Two of my really good friends are going through some hard times.  I'm trying so hard to be there for them.  Sometimes I don't know if I'm doing a very good job.  I've known them for so long and I still don't know what to do.  Does that mean I'm a bad friend?  That I wasn't paying close enough attention?  When they're upset I still don't even know if they need to be alone or if they want someone there with them.  And when I'm there, do I even help?  I have so many of my own issues that I'm scared of unintensionally burdening them further with my stuff. That is the key word...burden.  Why do I always feel like I'm burdening people.  I think that's why so many people have such a wrong idea about who I am or how I feel about things.  I'm so convinced that I'm a burden on everyone that I don't allow anyone to know me.  It'll be ok, lets change topics

       I just switched over to Blog.  I used to have a livejournal, but it really sucked.  I have a couple friends who post here so I decided to follow suit.  I only had a couple livejournal entries so I transfered them over.  Here you go...  (I use ... way too much)

       Ok, the verdict is in. I'm going to send a care package. I figure a game boy, some moisture gloves and lotion (she used to make fun of me for my skin softening system), cookies, ect... I was talking to my roomates about her and all about our relationship. It reminded me how messed up everything got. I'm really glad that it's settled now. But, then I went to get a picture to show them. I couldn't find the specific one I was looking for right away. You know how you get all panicked and think "where are you baby" (don't think I'm crazy, you know you do it too). Then you realize that you're getting all stupid. I'm missing her. I don't get it. But, I'm so worried about her and I do want to talk to her. It's not like I'm not over her. I really am.  Aren't I?  It's weird, you just get rebounded once in a while. Now I have her pic on my dresser. I need to put it away and stop acting stupid. I think I'll feel better once I send her a little note. Tomorrow it'll be all better.  On an entertaining note. I was also talking to my roomate (and her friend) about a date I had a couple weeks ago that didn't go too well (it's a good story, but you're not gonna get it tonight). Just then my other roomate walked in the room and told me about this butch who wrote her off of friendster. Same one. I think it's funny. I told her to write back saying "Liz told me all about you". Or, invite her over for dinner. It'll be entertaining. I love entertainment. Honestly though, I feel bad about that date. I really didn't present myself very well at all. Oh, Oh, it looks like you might be getting the story afterall (this will be the greatly abriviated version). Maybe not. I just wrote like a whole page and even that made me sound like a bitch and that's in my own words. To put it in short. At the end we went to a club and I ended up feeling REALLY uncomfortable. I mean REALLY uncomfortable. I don't normally drink a whole lot. I got pretty wasted and acted stupid. No I didn't do anything horribly bad. I was just a stumbling lush. The next morning I felt really bad. I was all depressed. I called Lei to appoligize, but she won't talk to me (but apparently she'll talk to my roomate). I know that on the car ride home I was talking alot. You know when you're talking out of your ass. You know that what you're saying isn't good, you can tell by her face, but you just keep talking. Ya, it was like that. I'm not sure what I said, but she won't talk to me, so I guess it wasn't good. The next day I also realized why I was so uncomfortable. I realized that I was in trophy position. This I really will explain later (not tonight). Overall, why I feel so bad is because we did get along. I feel like her judging me by how I acted that night is a total misrepresentation of who I am. But, that's what dates are for...to judge.

       See, this is why I don't keep a journal. I am so bad at keeping it updated. I guess the big news is that my ex, cc, wrote me. I freaked out last week over how she was doing. I just got an e-mail a couple days ago. She's somewhere over there in the desert, I don't know where. She sounds really happy (well, as happy as you can get in an e-mail). So, I'm relieved. I'm debating whether to send her a care package or not. I kinda want to, but it took so long to break contact. I'll ask my therapist. Oh, there's something else. I made my therapist cry last week. That's gotta be a bad sign. I was telling her about my dad and she just felt so bad for me. Oh well. What else..... I got felt up by a drag queen while watching a BDSM movie. That's always fun. The sad part it, it's the most action I've gotten in a while. Well, except for this date I had a couple weeks ago. But, that was just BAD, so I'm not going to get into it. Last thing, I met up with a girl yesterday. We get along really well, but she's alot older. You know what.? I really don't want to talk about anything right now.  Hi Red!!

       Tonight when walking the block from my car to this thing I was going to, I had a random moment. When crossing the street some guy at the red light put his head out the window and told me to smile. I decided to be nice today so I smiled at him. He said that's better and I yelled thanks. Then he asked me if my tits were real. I shouted yes and he said they were nice. He then honked and waved as he drove away. It's so anti-feminist, but oh well. Thank you...I have nice tits!!

       It seems that alot of shit went wrong today, but for some reason, I'm in a good mood.  go figure  Tomorrow I have to work the night shift to train a new girl.  There is supposed to be some other guy working but he's a flake and no one knows if he quit or not.  If he shows tomorrow I get to be "acting manager" for the day then continue marrily with my morning shift.  If he doesn't show, I have to move to nights.....  please don't make me!!  The one thing that's gonna suck is that if he shows I gotta work till 11 thurs then start fri at 7.  That's gonna suck.  oh well.   I'm looking forward to this weekend.  Friday night (if I don't have to work) and Saturday I'm gonna chill with my friend in the east bay playing video games and talking.  Yeahee!!  On Sat night it looks like I can get free tickets to a commedy club in San Jose.  I'm gonna see if Elaine wants to go, if not I'll pitch it to Red, Gouch, Big A.  I don't know how many tickets I can get.  Sun it looks like possibly a 4th of July BBQ, but won't stay long cause I'm working Mon morning at 7.  I'm thinking of seeing what the crew is doing. Oh, random thing.  I need to write my old boss from HI to get a reference.  Since that money laundering scandle was still going on when I left I thought I'd investigate a little so that I could say I'm glad it all worked out or whatever.  I went online and searched.  I found out that besides the bit of jain time he did last year, he has crazy fines and community service.  Yes, he was actually convicted of money laundering and racketeering.  But, here's the funny part.  They had a list of other firms being investigated now.  I recognized most of them as who I used to work with.  There's the soils guy, the architect, ect....   Why do I always end up working with a bunch of shady ass people?  I guess it's just me. Oh, another good thing.  My dad's heart doctor agreed to take me.  He's really good and not taking new patients, but agreed to see me.  I am so special!!  My apt isn't till end of July though.  My dad's freaking out saying it's too far away.  I'm eating pretty good now, so I don't think I'll hurt myself too bad in the next month.  I REALLY don't want to go on drugs, but for the first time I'm actually willing to if I need them. Lastly, MC still hasn't called.  I left a voice message last night.  Either he's busy, or yet ANOTHER one to add to the list of people who don't like me.  It's ok though cause I don't like a whole lot of people.  *kisses*

       Today went pretty well.  It was emotional, but good.  This morning I got that e-mail....very cool.  At my therapist things went well.  She wanted to see my shoulders which I refused to show her.  We talked how the scratching ect.. is actually a comforting technique.  When you get hurt, your body releases endorphines which make you feel good.  From what I understand, this is the idea behind flogging (S & M).  So, it makes sense that when I'm really upset I hurt myself as a form of comfort.  Yes, it sounds crazy, but it does make sense.  The trick now is to replace that form of "comfort" with something else.  I know that the posting talking about it was pretty weird.  That's cause it was right after I got out of the shower.  I wasn't feeling like writing, but needed to put something down otherwise I would just brush it off and forget about it.  We also talked about CC....alot.  And of course it went back to fear.  Why do I always continue to associate with people who can seriously injer me?  With my dad, I have a real, genuine fear that he will hurt me.  But I not only continue to stay around him (of course I'll do that, he's my dad).  But I also try to have real conversations with him.  I already know how they'll end.  He'll end up screaming at me and I'll get panicy.  Last summer when I was staying with him, I had to lock my doors every night and keep pepper spray on me, but I stayed there.  Well, until he flipped out on me.  And now with CC.  I am seriously scared of her.  I moved without changing my address (which almost ruined my credit) and changed my number.  So, after all contact is cut and I'm happy, what do I do?  I not only send her a package and a note basically saying "I still love you", I also send her my new address.  Now I can be worried all over again.  Well, she's overseas, so it isn't likely, but when she gets back it's a very real possibility she would just show up.  I just worry cause she's got so much hate in her and I know she has potential to hurt me.  She once even told me that if she ever found out I ever dated a guy it would not be ok.  So that takes us back to the MC thing.  Ok, I know I can get things worked out with her.  Just gotta figure it out.  Basically though I fucked up.  Red, you were right, I shouldn't have contacted her.  I should have known better, I just wanted to be honest and thought that enough time had passed that she could handle it.....I was VERY wrong.  Other stuff today, I wore heals for the first time in a while.  My calf spazamed a little but nothing too bad.  I got an e-mail from Archie.  I'm still on his mass e-mail list.  I have them go automatically to my trash, but sometimes read them.  I was even thinking about him yesterday.  My therapist and i were talking a while back.  See, he teaches at a high school.  I don't want to deal with all that happened.  I want to just forget about it.  The problem is, he works with young girls and i know he can be "not-good" (I don't know what word to use).  My therapist thinks I should send an anonomous letter to either the school or police dept saying basically "Archie teached at the high school.  I was sexually assalted by him before and strongly believe he has the potential to do it again.  I am not interested in persuing any legal action.  If any other alligations come up against him, please take them seriously".  I keep thinking about it, but don't know if I want to deal with it.  I know that this makes me a bad woman for not running out and making an example of him and burning him at the stake in the name of all women everywhere.  But, I need to worry about me.  I can't even get a fucking massage, I still get flashbacks sometimes.  I don't think I can face it so head on.  I think that I still just want to think about it as "messing around".  Anyways, football player asshole was much worse and I can't do jack shit about him.  Well, I guess it's more I won't.  I think I want to just forget about it all and move on.  It's so anti-feminist.  Oh, back to the e-mail.  Appently he is sick.  They don't know what's wrong with him but he had to go to the ER the other day.  I know I'm a sadist bitch, but fuck him I don't care.  Karma Bi-otch!!  Oh, and I saw Fahrenheit 911.  Oh, my god.  It was so good.  As always, Moore goes over the top, but he raises so many good points.  I think that overall just seeing all the shit that has been comming out over that last years condenced into one place really makes you think and realize how bad it is.  I think everyone there was balling.  I was no way an exception.  But it was kinda nice to cry and hurt over something real and bigger than myself.  Crying over your own life and crying over things bigger than yourself carry two entirly separate feeling. The one thing is, they showed alot of overseas footage.  All I could think of was CC.  I really don't want her to get hurt.  My first reaction is to write her and tell her to please come back.  She can use the gay "get out of military free card".  But, I know I can't.  In fact, now it's apparent that I can't even tell her that I'm worried.  I guess I have to harden myself....again, well at least to her.  So, I guess I'll just have to be sad and worry and not let her know.  What do I say to her?  Things are so bad over there.  I want her to feel comfort and love but if I do that it'll make it worse.  Please help me out here guys.  I really need some advice.

       Hey!!  I had a SHITTY day today.  I know I still need to deal with the CC thing....later.  I went to the store and got $1.99 wine.  Two bottles later, I'm pretty good.  I'm gonna go watch my movie and go to bed.  Hopefully my therapist can sort it all out tomorrow.  I love her!!

       I'm finally feeling better, so I figured I'd do a little update on Pride Weekend.  It was pretty cool.  Kinda random.  Well, Friday was my date with MC (the trannie boi).  I already said that we got along well, made out a little.  He was very endearing.  Kept holding my hand, hand on my back, ect..  Well, Sat at Dyke March he ended up comming.  I was running around to a few groups of friends but finally ended up hanging out with him and his friends (2 butch/femme couples).  It was fun, I just started to realize that we really are very different.  He is very "good'ol boy" as my wildlife conservation teacher would say.  And to be quite honest, I'm not sure what he'd want with me.  No, I am not being down on myself.  I have been played enough times and had enough people only interested in me cause they thought they could score to question the motives of someone who thinks so differently from me.  His friends are totally cool though.  So, if you can judge someone based on their friends, then it's good.  It's just he and his friends are very "all american" I don't know.  I was dressed all rocker.  I think I looked pretty hot.  Ok, over-analyzing and being stupid.  There are several things I'm apprehensive about regarding him as well, so I shouldn't be so "what does he see in me?"  But, ya....  sat we kissed a little before I got on Muni.  Oh, kissing note.  First kiss in the club...really not good.  Making out later that night....really good.  Kiss goodbye yesterday...not so hot.  Maybe we just need to mesh.  Anyway, this morning waiting for the parade he walked by and stood and watched the parade with my friend and I for a while then took off.  I think he hung out for like 2 hours or so.  So, it's not like he jetted off.  He had a hug goodbye.  I'm feeling like something isn't right and he's not interested anymore, but not so sure.  I'll see if he calls tomorrow.  He should do the calling, right?  Since I made the last call?  Why do people always insist on keeping score like that, it's stupid.  Oh, I did add him to my friendster (well, put in the request) so I think that that's a move.  My friends keep telling me to just see how it goes not to try to figure it out and analyze, but I'm scared that if I don't think it through there's a danger of a bad relationship that could have been avoided.....again.  Ok, on a different note.  One on the performers today was this girl I went out with a couple times.  She is the most amazing woman I've ever met.  She's a lawyer, dancer, singer, and she's just cool.  I saw her on stage today and my mouth flew open, she is sooo hot.  We went out like twice and talked on the phone for a while, but then it was just like nothing.  So, I'm gonna send her an e-mail telling her that I saw her and she did good.  That's all I'm gonna say, see if she replies with a "let's hang out some time".  I think I need to re-investigate my dating skills.  I think that I turn off alot of people.  I think it's cause I talk to much and put my foot in my mouth.  Or I get nervous and go for the liquor.  Anyway, have work tomorrow.  Last week of asshole boss man....I hope.  We shall see.  Love Yall!!  Good Night!!

       To put it mildly I'm extreamly upset.  Remember how I wrote that back in Jr. High I used to hurt myself but I don't do that anymore?  Well, when I get like this, all bets are off.  It's not like I lied cause I forgot how I'm like when I'm upset.  In the shower, I cried...alot.  Had a couple minor panic attacks (hyperventalating).  Then I get weird, like a trance.  I don't know why, but my hand go to my throat and squeeze, I start scratching myself and just feel violent.  You know how you take the cap of the conditioner and hit it on your hand, I did that so hard I have a semi-circle cut on my hand.  Well, not really a cut, it only is the first layer of skin I think.  When I got out of the shower, my vision is blurry.  I'm not sure if it's from crying or pushing on my eyes.  My shoulders hurt from scratches and I'm drained.  I don't think I want to talk any more.  I need dinner.  I just wanted to write a bit before I forgot cause I know that I need to start checking myself.  I just wish there was someone here to hold me.  But I know it's not gonna happen.  And I probably would just end up feeling worse anyway.  I'm fucked up like that.

       2 e-mails.  I'm crying now, so I'll write more after a hot shower.  First E-mail:  In response Hey ,     It's me again . I decided that handwriting a letter to is almost physically immpossible. Then I realized that I could change the font.Then I found those nifty emoticons, which made it all the better. So in my mind I feel that this is almost as personal as a hand writtin letter and you will recieve it  a lot quicker. The best of both worlds. Now if I could only learn how to type faster.Then everything would be golden      Hopefully that gave you a little laugh. Now down to business.  The last e-mail I recieved has confused me a little. Well actually a lot. You wrote " Let's have this be the last time either of us get's teary eyed because of the other." Now me being who I am I can take that two ways.       In a positive way. Saying bascially let's not lose contact again. That maybe we could be friends or something.       Or in a negative way. Basically saying never contact  each other again. If that is the case. I'm really sorry you feel that way, but then there are somethings I need to get off my chest.        There is nothing I can do to change what has happened , and I know that. All I can really do is be supportive of you and your decision.  That's what I did in Hawaii and that's all I can do know. You wrote " It sounds as though you have moved on and I as well."           Yeah.  I've continued living. I possible even moved on . But  I never really let you go like you let me. To be honest It was not until I  moved out of my apartment that I took your pictures down. I didn't take your picture out of my wallet until I came here. I guess that's when I gave up. When I figured you didn't care about me. So when I sent  out that  mass e-mail I honestly 100% did not expect to hear from you.  So when your package came I was happy, then sad, then angry.There are no words that describe how I feel write now. I don't want you out of my life , but to be honest your last e-mail says just that to me.            I do wish that you would of called me , when you wanted to. Don't be so preoccupied with how other peolpe might feel. If you have a problem or need to talk feel free to contact me. Remeber I said that I am always willing to listen. I will tell you if I can't handle it. I guess that is what hurt me the most. Is that you made a decision for me, an d there is nothing I can do about it.           I just wish that things could of worked out better. I still have really strong feelings for you, and that is something that I have to deal with ,but please don't let this end of any type of relatsionship that we might be able to have. There so many things I want to tell you about.  I've done alot since you left. But I am hesistant to tell you.        Hell I am so tired of trying to analyze things that , I just don't know anymore. I will tell you this. I sleep with the foam football every night, and I cut almost all my hair off.          Well I guess that's all I really need to say. Hopefully you don't take this the wrong way. I hope that you are able to find your happiness some and maybe I'll find mine.                                                                                                     CC P.s . I am waiting for something in the mail before I send off that check, but it will be coming soon.   Second e-mail:  Afterthouhgt Hey, It's me again. First I would like to say I am sorry about your grandfather. I also lost contact with my family after my grandmother passed. So I kind of know how you feel.I would also like to say that I am your friend. You once said that you admired my strength. Well let my strenght help you now. I accept the fact that we will not be together again I won't accept the fact that we can't be friends.  One last thing I am able to make phone calls from here ( hint, hint ).                                                                                                   CC

       Well, I just got back from a date that actually went well.  We went to a lesbian show.  It was really fun.  I went with a FTM (female to male).  He's on horemones (has facial hair and deep voice) and has had upper body surgery (breasts removed) but I don't think the lower body (still had girlie parts).  If you saw him on the street, he looks 100% male.  (If you're reading this and feel uncomfortable it's time to check your stereotypes and tolerence levels.)  I've never dated a trannie before so I was a little nervous.  Oh, and to top it off, he's a cop.  There's another I never do.  Anyway he's really nice.  Looks kinda like an all american boy.  Which again is something I don't normally do.  So I guess this was different in all ways.  I'm just proud of myself for not fucking up a date.  Usually I do something stupid.  Tonight we just got along and had a really good time.  Even smooched a little bit.  We shall see (my choice phrase of the week). Time for bed, dyke march is tomorrow.

       I finally know 100% that there is not only stealing going on but the manager is doctoring to books to hide it.  His punk ass is getting fired.  Yes it's bad to encourage the "laying off" of someone but he's an asshole.  Just to give you a little sample, a little girl came in yesterday saying that she was putting together little packs of shampoo, soap, ect.. to pass out at homeless shelters and wanted to know if we could donate maybe 4-5 of each.  The manager gets a discusted look on his face.  I not only gave her shampoo, but also sewing kits, toothpaste, shaving gel, ect...  What the fuck?  It's for a homeless shelter and the girl was only maybe 8.  He's gonna be gone the end of this month.  Hopefully things will get better after that.  On the up side, my dad was (somewhat) nice to me today.  He calls me every day to have lunch eith him.  Kinda weird.  Things will get better very soon, I can feel it.

       Well, we'll see if this works.  I'm at work so I can't get into the  posting site.  I'm supposed to be able to post thru e-mail....we'll see.   I saw my dad a little bit ago.  I thought that we reached this new  level in our relationship where we'd be able to get along.  But then I was  reminded that that isn't possible.  We got in a little bit of an  agrument.  He then picked up a pair of scissors.  My eyes got big and all I  could think was "damn Liz, you fucked up again".  He just put them away  but it reminded me how scared I get.  Oh well, that's my dad.

       I'm VERY pissed off at the people at work.  I know that something is going on.  I may not be 100% with the books, but I know when something isn't right, and something just isn't right.  I think someone's stealing.  Money keeps comming up missing and no one seems to care.  And I'm embaressed about the shit we're putting out for "marketing".  It looks like a 6th grade art project the the mom is just like "oh, that's nice honey....let's just put it away.....for safe keeping".  Ok, breath no more angry, negative thoughts.  I'm a little worried about that.  I'm back to my serious blank face.  I'm trying to be more expressive facially but it's hard.  I'm try harder.  I bought myself a present yesterday.  Kinda a independence gift.  I love lingerie but I only ever get it when I'm in a relationship with someone.  And then I get what they'd like.  Well, I am single but I like lingerie.  I passed by Vicki's Secret and they had a massive sale.  There were these little slips for $19.99 and for Vicki's that's really cheap.  So I got myself a bright pink nightie.  It's for me.  No one's gonna be seeing it, it's just for me to have and enjoy.  I decided that I'm going to start wearing cute lingerie again regardless of my relationship status.  So yes I am sitting at my desk, my myself, typing this entry in a black lacy thing.  But you know what...I can do that!!

       It's been a while since I wrote, so I have a little bit of updating to do.  Last Thurs was a pretty good day.  I saw my dad and hung out with Red.  That was the first time in forever that my dad didn't make me cry.  So, as fucked up as that is, it's a start.  I'm trying to be more open with him and honest.  I even told him my cholesterol.  I've been dancing around the issue for a while with him.  He knew it was high, but I refused to give him the number.  Well, I finally did.  As expected, I got a long, involved lecture.  See, my cholesterol is the same as his was when he had his first heart attack (at 34).  I'm trying to accept the fact that he's worried about me.  It's annoying as hell, but I know he's just really concerned.  But of course, to offset this real fatherly concern about my health, he proceeds to expalin to me why I'm fucking up my life by getting a PhD.  It  ammazes me that he has the balls to say that.  I always thought he was Pro-Education, but I guess he's Pro-Education in the field I choose.  I'm going for a PhD!!  I'm going to be a doctor, and he thinks I'm a failure.  Oh, well...that's my dad.  Today was also a pretty good day.  I made a new friend.  I decided to join this queer women's group and she's in it.  She has a girlfriend, so it's not like that at all (in case that's what you were thinking).  Anyway, we met up this morning to walk.  We walked probably 3-5 miles.  That's good since I've been lazy with the gym lately.  But, we talked alot about things.  Mostly about how we've changed so much and right now trying to figure out where we are and who we are.  I'm not who I was in college.  In fact I'm embarresed of who I was back then.  I feel like I've changed so much.  But then it's wierd cause you don't really know who you are anymore.  I find myself sometimes slipping back into my old role and I hate it.  I don't like that person anymore, I want her to go away.  I'm not crazy like I used to be.  Sure, I regress sometimes, but that's not me.  So, in all we talked for like 3 hours.  I really think we're gonna end up friends.  Other stuff today.  I'll say the depressing one first so I can end on a happy note.  Today is Father's Day.  This is truely my least favorite holiday of the year.  It even beats out Columbus Day (and if you know me, you know how much I loathe Columbus).  First things first, no my father does NOT want to see me for Father's Day.  But, anyway I went to get him a card.  I hate shopping for Father's Day cards.  They all go off about how much he taught you, what a good dad he was, ect...  I want to know where the Dead Beat Dad section is.  Every fucking year I almost cry looking for a card cause they are all so fucking sweet.  Where's the "you're an asshole but I love you anyway" or "i turned out well despite you, not because of you" or "thank you for giving me enough problems for years of therapy" cards.  I just look for one that says "I love you, happy father's day".  But those don't exist.  They're all mushy sweet endearing, "you're the greatest dad in the whole wide world cards".  I only found 2 that I could give without being a total liar.  And I recognized them both as one's I'd given him before.  So, I picked the one I gave to him year before last.  I says "Dad, I feel lucky to be your Daughter, and I may not say it enough but I'll always love you, Happy Father's Day".  Yes, the first part is not entirely true, but this is the closest one I could find.  Don't believe me, look for yourself.  There are no plain cards.  Oh well, whatever.  Ok, on to the happy stuff.  This sat my friend is having a gender bending party for pride.  So, I'm going Butch.  I'm very excited.  I went to target today to pick up a pair of Dickies and a button down shirt.  I also got a sportsbra that's 2 sizes too small, so my boobs go from D to gone.  It's a little scarry, and slightly uncomfortable.  Just trying to figure out what to do with my hair.  I'm thinking low ponytail or braid.  Maybe a baseball cap.  Oh, I even went to Sephora and got free samples of cologne so I can smell like a guy.  My friend asked if I'm gonna pack but I'm a little apprehensive.  I think it'll look stupid.  Anyway, what am I supposed to use.  I was thinking just a sock if anything.  Some website I found said to fill a condom with hair gel.  Ummmm....no, I don't think I will.  I think that you'll be able to see my sportsbra under the T-shirt so if I pack it might just look wierd.  I'll think about it.  Anyway, won't that get uncomfortable, and what if my sock falls out when dancing or something.  Do you think I'll make an ok Butch or will I just look funny?

       I've made some diet fo paas.  I had cheese yesterday...twice.  And I just finished soy ice cream.  The cheese was fresh motzerella on a sandwhich and goat cheese on a salad.  So, I guess it's not as bad as it could be.  My claves are killing me.  I sprained them back in April by lifting too much weight and couldn't walk well for a while.  They never really healed.  It's been months now and they still hurt.  I'm thinking I should go for a massage.  I'm nervous though.  I haven't given or received a massage since 2002.  That's when I was raped after giving my friend a massage when he was stressed.  I keep telling people I'm gonna get one, then chicken out.  The thing is now my leg has been fucked up for months.  I really gotta do something.  I'm also trying to get over it cause it would really be some good extra money to do massage again.  I'm thinking I should give some to non-threat people first.  But who's no threat.  My friend was.  Well, he's not my friend anymore.  I'll call him Archie.  The funny thing about that is that to this day I don't think he realizes what he did.  Ok, I don't want to get into this or get all depressed.  So I'm gonna forget about it for now.  I had a date last night.  She was really nice, and smart too.  I've never dated anyone smart.  I'm gonna hold my breath for now though cause we'll see where it goes.  Oh, and tomorrow I have a work social thingie that I'm going to take Red to.  I'm really looking forward to spending some time with her just the two of us.  I was really worried that things got weird for a while.  I'm hoping it'll be nice to just chill and have a fun evening together.    Oh shit, I should probably pack a bag for tomorrow night.  My mom is going out of town tomorrow and I wanna say bye to her but I'm meeting red right after work then we go to that thing.  So, I figure I'll stay at her place that night.  You know what, I'm done writting for the night.   urlLink

       I did all my laundry tonight and even cleaned my room.  Go Me!!  I'm annoyed with work cause everyone there whines all the freakin time.  But it's cool.  I'm used to the commute.  My "diet" is going good.  At my friend's house I had a couple bites (2) of tiramisu, and a diet ice cream sandwich.  So, I didn't do too bad for a hanging out night.  No chips or dip or anything.  I'm down to 1 cup of coffee a day.  But, on the bad side I've only gone to the gym that one day I wrote about.    I'm doing better with CC.  I know that I did a stupid thing by writing that e-mail so I sent a second one.  I was debating whether it was digger my hole deeper or really making it better.  Here it is...  Ok, I was gonna include it but it's not saved to my sent folder. *shrug*  It was just saying sorry for the emotional one.  That we have both moved on and I shouldn't be opening old wounds.  So, I think it is time I officially moved on.  I even put her pictures away today.  So, I'm doing better.  I'm hoping that the first letter will let her know that I care and the second will help her solidify the fact that we are not getting back together and let her know that I'll be ok.  I had flashes of her quitting the army and running back her thinking that I needed her.  I don't want her to think this.  So, I'm closing this chapter...again.  (of course we'll see what she writes back)

       I'm feeling really good tonight.  I'm still nervous about how CC is going to respond to my e-mail.  I'm worried that it's giong to upset her.  But, I feel like a weight has been lifted.  I finally got to say something that had been stressing me for a while now.  Yes, I wrote the words, you know which ones.  I'm a little scared that she's going to think that it's possible to get back together.  I don't want her to get her hopes up, but I do want her to know how I feel.  Last night I went to the east bay to hang out with my friend and her friend (3 of us).  It was exactly what I needed.  We hung out watched movies, played video games (which surprisingly I won at), and talked till 5:00 am.  I got up at 9:00 am and again just hung out, watched movies, played games, and went swimming.  I got only 4 hours of sleep.  But feel surprisingly rested.  I think that it's because that's the first I've let myself just completly veg out for about 21 hours.  Her house reminded me of Nicki's.  I'll explain.  Third year of college I was not doing too hot.  I was very lonely and didn't feel like I belonged anywhere.  Nicki's house was the only place that felt like sort of home.  I would go over there on Thursdays to watch Must See TV, eat junk food, and play games.  It was just so welcoming and comfortable.  That's how I feel about my friend's place in the East Bay.  This was the first I've been there and it just felt so welcoming and comfortable.  I haven't had a sleepover in a long long time.  I'm so glad I missed the party for it, it really was worth it.  They're cool too.  I'm not in the mood to think of creative names right now so they shall remain nameless untill next time.  I just thought it was funny.  While I was in the bathroom (those of you who know me know that I spend a great deal of time there) they discussed amonst themselves then when I got out asked me if I knew that I was hot.  I'm not sure how to answer that.  I really don't consider myself hot and know for a fact of several people not interested in me cause I was not "hot enough".  I told them this but they didn't believe me.  It was however a huge ego boost.  Between this, the wedding, and the breast comment.  I think I should probably be working on my self esteam issues.  Maybe I'm cutter than I though.  I usually think of myself as  (never mind, these are negavive thoughts and need to be stricken from my mind).    Yes I am one sexy bitch!!

       I'm actually feeling much better after writing CC.  I'm still worried about upseting her, but at least I was honest.  I didn't do a whole lot today.  Tried to study for the GRE.  I took the diagnostic test and totally screwed up.  I gotta pull my shit together if I want to get into grad school.  Today I wore my sponge bob square pants undies for the first time and my "house dress".  I think this was sorta like my thinking and sulking over her.  But, I do feel better and I know it's gonna be ok.  Oh, I also went through my whole journal and edited stuff I wrote about her.  Not sure why.    Tonight I was invited to a party but I think I'm gonna skip.  Instead I called up a friend in the east bay.  We're gonna hang out and play board games and talk.  A night like that seems much more appealing to me right now.  Warning, I'm probably gonna screw up my diet tonight.  I'll try to be good though.  The only thing that sucks is she lives over an hour away.  I'll bring a toothbrush just in case I need to crash there (very probable).  Mildred is feeling a little blah today.   urlLink

       I haven't written in a couple days and do have alot to fill youin on.  Here's the just of it.  No cheese, no sweets, keeping coffe down, blah, blah, blah.  Whatever, my "diet" is fine.  My dad is a dick.  Yes, he made me cry (at work)...again.  Yes, he fucked me over...again.  Yes, he was mean to me...again.  Whatever, fuck him.  Ok not really.  I came to the conclusion a while ago that with my dad I have 2 options.  I can continue to allow myself to be beat down by my dad, or I can loose my dad.  No matter how much it hurts, I'm not ready for option 2 quite yet. Ok, is that enough of a summary.  CC wrote me today.  I haven't been able to stop crying since.  I don't know what to do.  Please help me.  I want so badly to start writing her again and have communication, but I don't think that's a very good idea.  I don't know what to say to her.  I need to talk to someone but I can't think of anyone.  Anne is super busy righ now with moving, I don't want to bother her.  Plus, this is the last weekend she and her husband have before leaving.  Red, Big A, and Gouch are down south at a graduation.  And I can't talk to my family.  I could call Bunny (my rock climbing buddy), we've been talking alot about ex's and she understands how I feel.  But, I'm tired of being known as the depressing one with problems.  I don't want people to think that that's who I am.  If I always talk to them about my issues, that's who I'll become. I think that I'll just do some alone time today and try to figure out what to write.  I started something, but it sucks.  Maybe I'll just let it suck.  Just be honest and write what comes to mind.  I want to write her ASAP.  I know she probably won't check her e-mail for a while, but I want it there when she does.  Here's what she wrote me: ************* Hey,  I just wanted to let you know that I recieved your package. Thank you. I received it about a week and half ago. I had set myself a time limit in which I had to reply. To be truly honest I didn't know if I was going to reply. I really don't know what to say. Other than the fact that I was very surprised actually I was dumdfounded. The package nearly brought me to tears. So many questions have been running through my mind since then. The main question is Why Now?. I may never know that answer but I just had to ask. Is it because I am over here? Would have contacted me If I was still in Hawaii?  I guess it really doesn't matter but I you could answer those questions I would appreciate it. I don't in anyway what to throw a guilt trip on you. I can only guess what you've been going through. I truly do wish that things are working out for you. For me though things are okay. No new relationsonships, just me I think I've grown a little bit since you left.Well I don't knoe if I'll hear from you again so I will just say this.  Thank you very much for being apart of my life. I will always remember you.   Please if you can respond to this e-mail                                                                                                       CC (smily face)  p.s.    You will be recieving a letter and  a check in about three weeks .  I will be sending it to the address that was on the card .  *************** She sounds good, huh?  I'm really glad.  Do you think she hates me?  I don't want her money.  I really do love her.  I know we won't work as a couple, but I care for her so much it hurts.

       I'm actually doing really really well today.  Night before last I talked to Red for about an hour on the phone.  It really ment alot to me and made me feel much better.  I've known her for 6 years and I love her so much.  It seems like lately things have been really strained between us and I was seriously scared that I was loosing her as a friend.  Our talk though made me feel like she really does apriciate the fact that I'm going through something right now and I know how much she cares for me.  That ment more to me than I can explain.  Since then I've been feeling much much better.  Maybe the reason why I wear my problems on my sleve is because I'm searching for that connection.  I don't know.  I'm not trying to say that I'm magically better.  Yes, I'm still having bad thoughts, but not as often.  And night before last (the night we talked) I actually winced when I thought about cutting myself.  That's a big improvement.  Oh, and I switched the CD in my car.  I've been listening to the same CD on repeat for over a year now (since I was living in Hawaii).  I usually just switched it when someone was with me.  So, today I listened to India Arie (spelling?).  So that's a positive change too.  I'm also doing better in ways that I won't discuss right now.  Overall I'm good.  I've been thinking about psychiatrists and don't think I'll go to him right now.  Either I'm really getting better, or I'm on an upswing.  If I'm on an upswing then I have some time to get strong before the next bad spell.  Overall today was chill.  Didn't fuck up too much at work.  Started studying for the GRE.  I tried to read Bitch (it's a total feminist magazine) but my coworkers kept stealing it cause the ads are funny.  The one I'm going to post on my wall is "Put your pussy where your politics are.  Support feminist sex toy stores."  Very cool.  Oh, FYI apparently Curves gym is heavily linked to several Christian organizations and their proceeds partly go to Pro-Life organizations.  Just so you know.  Ok, the diet/caffine recovery plan: 6:45 - Wake 8:30 - Breakfast: 1 slice sourdough, 1 slice soy cheese, Veganaise, 3 pieces Soy bacon, tofu scramble, 6oz (approx) Orange Juice (Lots of soy...GOOD, Not varying protien source...BAD, Eating sourdough instead of whole wheat...BAD, Got a little too full...BAD, Healthy breakfast...GOOD, juice...GOOD, not fresh...BAD, ya like I'm really going to squeeze fresh juice in the morning...GOOD) 9:00 - 12 oz coffee with Nonfat milk and 2 packs equal (getting my fix...BAD, only 1 cup...GOOD, really big cup...BAD, only 2 packs "sugar"...GOOD, using equal to cheat...BAD, got headache from caffine withdrawl but nothing unbearable and got through with no drugs...VERY GOOD, having muscle spasms from withdrawl all day and yes right now too...BAD) 12:20 - Munch: Orange/Tangerine Juice and pumpkin seeds (snacks...GOOD, got too hungry before eating...BAD, seeds...GOOD) 1:00 - Lunch:Leftover pea and tofu curry with one paratha finish juice (15 oz total), Vanilla nonfat yogurt (bringing left overs...GOOD, curry is healthy...GOOD, paratha is fried...BAD, juice...GOOD, yogurt...GOOD, 4 hrs since last meal...GOOD considering big breakfast) 2:30 - 1 lifesaver mint (it's almost candy...careful...BAD, it's not candy...really...GOOD) 4:45 - GYM:  35 min on elliptical on resistance 8 (workout...GOOD, got lazy ass to gym...GOOD, heart rate got too high...BAD, still went hard...BAD, bottle of water at gym...GOOD) 7:00 (or so) - Dinner:  Microwave (yes a tv dinner) of vegan organic enchillada with rice and beans, approx 10 oz orange/tangerine juice(vegan...GOOD, Microwave...BAD, juice...GOOD) 8:00 (or so) - Dessert: baked banana with cinnomon, sugar, and cashews (dessert...BAD, fruit as opposed to the tiramisu in the fridge...GOOD, got too full...BAD)   I think that's it.  Not too bad today.  No cheese, only 1 cup coffee, kinda alot of sugar (especially with the juice), not enough water (why am I not drinking water??)  Ok, that's good.  Night!

       First off I want to say that everything went pretty good today with my therapist.  I might have to get psychological testing.  She wants me to see a psychiatrist to talk first.  I don't want anything on record though because the insurance companies might raise my rates if there's shit on record (evil bastards) so I'll have to pay out of pocket.  I think I'll do it.  I guess thyroid problems can cause depression so there's one thing to pay attention to.  Also, I have to start tracking it to see if it is connected to my period and if it's in cycles.  Overall though I'm feeling much better about things.  Oh, one other thing I noticed is that I tend to have an emotionless expression when I talk to people.  I guess that's what makes me hard to read.  And after my sessions my face actually hurts from holding it that way.  So I'm going to try to be more expressive.  ok, I think that's all I have to say about that.  My newest enemy is starbucks.  As everyone is well aware I am heavily addicted to caffine.  I drink like 3 cups of coffee a day.  I decided to try to cut back.  On sat I didn't have any coffee for most of the day.  By about 3 or so (can't remember exactly) I got the worst headache so I got a latte and it was all better.  Today I tried to go sans cafe and again about 3 I had the worst headache, but this time I said "I know coffee will get rid of it but I'm going to be good".  Also I was out with that girl Lynn (who's really cool by the way).  It was when I was on the bart back from the east bay back to the city when the withdrawl got almost unbearable.  I could think, my head hurt more than you can imagine and I was getting sick.  I was seriously fearing that I was gonna puke on the bart.  I got to my stop and was in so much pain it was disorienting.  When I found a starbucks it was like a beacon from heaven.  I got my latte and before long started to feel better.  I felt so ashamed though.  If this were any other addictive substance people would say to push through and not give in, but I did.  I have immense respect to anyone that has overcome anything.  It hurts really bad (and mine is only caffine).  I think that starbucks is evil to pushing it's drug onto innocent people like me.  I will overcome this addiction...slowly.  and then I will never consume caffine again.  (please remind me of this next semester).  It took like 2 hours before I was fully functional again.  My plan is to cut it down to 1 cup a day, then switch to caffinated tea, then go to decaf tea.  I hope it works.  Ok, my official first day of my heart conscience diet.  I didn't do too good.  I didn't do horrible either.  Ok... 8:00 - Woke up (slept in so no gym today...BAD) 9:45 - Breakfast: Protien shake (Took too long getting ready so no time for a real breakfast...BAD, protien...GOOD, "ate" something...GOOD) 1:30 (or so) - Lunch: Organic Vegan Burritto and orange juice(3.75 hrs between eating when first meal was protien shake...BAD, Vegan lunch...GOOD) 3:30 (or so) - Water (still finishing bottle as we speak...BAD, Staying hydrated...BAD) 5:00 (or so) - Gellato: half marzipan chocolate, hald coconut (Sweets...BAD, she asked if I wanted soy or regular coconut and I said regular...BAD, Ordered a small...GOOD, I finished it...BAD) 6:30 (or do) - Nonfat Latte (Coffee...BAD, supporting the evils of starbucks...BAD, Nonfat...GOOD, 2 packs sugar...GOOD, the sugar was really equal to cheat...BAD) 7:00 (or so) - Mydol (I heard that Mydol is awesome for headaches and it worked...GOOD, using drugs to overcome addiction withdrawl...BAD) 8:00 (or so) - Dinner: Tofu scramble, 1 slice sourdough bread, veganaise, soy cheese, soy bacon (1 slice of bread and soy...GOOD, 6.5 hrs since last meal...BAD...VERY BAD, favorite meal made me happy...GOOD, leftovers will make a good breakfast...GOOD) 9:00 (or so) - 1 glass white wine (wine...GOOD, 1 glass...GOOD) 10:17 - Writting this Blog (expressing myself...GOOD, Haven't taken a shower and will have to wake up early to do so and may not have time for my good breakfast...BAD, planning on going to bead soon...GOOD)  So, how'd I do??

       My roomates and I were talking.  It seems like everyone had a bad day today.  Everyone was pissed at work.  I guess it was just global PMS day.  I just wanted to write I quite note to say that I feel much better now. So, as for what's going on with me.  I have a psudo date tomorrow.  Not sure if it's a date or not.  Don't you hate that awkward "are we hanging out as friends or is it a date?" situation.  Oh well, whatever is cool.  I'm not overly interested in her as more, but she seems cool.  We shall see.  I am currently eating a piece of Tiramisu that we finally cut.  We got it for my roomie's b-day last week.  I figure one last binge before my killer diet comming up.  I still have to figure out when I need to get a cholesterol test.  Wait, I'll do that now.  Ok, blood test is 2nd week of July.  That's in 5 weeks.  Meaning I should have started my super strict diet last week.  Damn it!!  Oh well.  We'll count that as the warm up week.  (as I put a bite of tirimisu in my mouth)  Ok, I will get it together.  I'll fill you in on my diet plans as soon as I figure them out.  For now, at least I'm planning on going to the gym tomorrow.  I was thinking of ditching out, but seeing as I'm already a week late, guess I can't.  Ok, talk to you later.  By the way, Mildred is celebrating global PMS day!!   urlLink

       *************READ ME************** This posting is kinda depressing I think.  Well, I think a few of them are.  But, anyways, please don’t think differently of me after this.  I’m still the same.  And don’t talk to anyone about it.  Thanks.    ANNE – Please don’t read me…PLEASE *********************************  Red, what you said in that comment really got me thinking.  I want to thank you.  I know that I wear my problems on my sleeve.  I think that I’m so used to defining myself by my problems that I don’t know how to be without them. I allow them to consume me.  But, I’m going to try really really hard to pull my shit together.  I know that I’ve been this way for forever but I do feel like I’ve been worse since moving back to Cali.  I’m still getting everything sorted out from last summer when I had that breakdown.  Well, I don’t know if it’s “technically” a nervous breakdown.  I ended up in a parking lot in Gilroy listening to Sympathetic Character [http://www.alanis-morissette.com/lyrics/sfij.html#SYMPATHETIC%20CHARACTER] on repeat muttering to myself.  I didn’t have time to deal with that before my grandfather died.  And, yes I am still having issues with that.  In fact I haven’t even been able to touch my Hindi books since the day he died.  They are still in the back seat of my car.  I won’t touch them.  Now my stressor is CC in Afghanistan.  As I’m writing this, I’m realizing that everyone has their own problems and I am not overly special.  But, I agree that I let them consume me.  Tomorrow I’ll be talking to my therapist about it.  Believe it or not, she really is helping and I am getting better.  I’m nervous about tomorrow though cause I promised to talk to her about something I don’t really want to talk about.  Though I know it will help.  Anyone who knows me knows that suicide has always been a factor.  So, that’s what I want to talk about.  Partly to get my thoughts straight for tomorrow and partly to just talk about it.  Most of my friends already know most of this, but here it is anyway.  I’ve been depressed my whole life.  I can remember back to kindergarten having issues.  All though grade school I was depressed.  I wasn’t suicidal cause I didn’t know what it was.  But I was into self-injury.  I would beat myself over the head, scratch up my arms, ect…  By Jr. High I was pretty disturbed.  I hated the human race.  I had no problem with people being hurt, I laughed.  And yes, I hurt myself A LOT, on a daily basis.  I hated life and everything having to do with it.  I was very suicidal.  In my spare time I would compose suicide notes.  That is what would comfort me before falling asleep.  But I also didn’t sleep much.  Once I went over two weeks with no sleep.  I would just lay in bed all night trying to figure out how I could kill myself without screwing things up worse for my mom and sisters.  Come high school I wasn’t quite as actively suicidal I just didn’t care one way or another.  Still thought up suicide notes, but not every second of the day anymore.  I didn’t hurt myself quite as often either.  But I did like it when I got hurt.  Actually I still like it when I get hurt.  Ever wonder why I show off my scars.  I love scars, I love bruises.  I don’t know why, it’s morbid, but I like getting hurt.  I was seriously pissed about my foot getting burned though cause that one wasn’t my doing.  Anyways, back to high school.  I was getting better.  I still hated people though.  It was my plan to get sterilized on my 18th b-day cause I didn’t want any chance of ever contributing to the persistence of the human race.  I think that pretty much explains my mind set.  Ok, college.  I’m not going to go through all the shit that happened there.  I’m not even going to sum it up.  I went pretty crazy for a while.  I had several what my therapist refers to as “passive suicide attempts”.  I guess that’s when you don’t actually do anything yourself, but you find situations where you can get seriously hurt/die and you put yourself in them.  I did that a lot.  Were not going to get into any of this either.  The huge turn around happened when I was living in Hawaii the first time (2000).  I went to the beach with the Moron.  You guys know who I’m talking about.  There were two small islands off the coast which he was going to swim to.  He was on the swim team.  He said that I wouldn’t be able to do it.  I just learned how to swim maybe a month before, so he was right.  However, I’m the kind of person who will always do whatever someone says I can’t do.  So, I started swimming.  Moron ended up getting ahead of me.  I lost him.  By the time I did I was exactly between the two lands.  I was starting to swallow water and getting tired.  No one around.  At first I panicked.  Then I thought “This is the exact situation you have always hoped for.  It will look like an accident.  Actually, it really is.  You can’t make it.  Just relax, put your head under water and take a deep breath.  Even if your reflexes are to cough it up and struggle, it won’t work cause you can’t stand.”  I thought I had a pretty good chance of dying anyway, might as well just wait for it.  I thought about it and floated there feeling great peace just staring at the water.  But, as I was telling myself this I automatically started swimming as hard as I could to shore.  I swam so hard I swam till my belly hit the sand.  After I was mad at myself for passing up such a perfect opportunity but realized that if that is what I did automatically, apparently I really didn’t want to die.  That was the last time I considered myself suicidal.  I’ve had problems and it has crossed my mind but I just remind myself that I had the opportunity and didn’t take it, so I must not really want it.  Up until today, I know that I don’t want to die.  I don’t have thoughts.  Ok, sometimes I have thoughts, but now it’s more inclinations.  I don’t want to die in my head, but I always have the urge to, I don’t know, drive off the cliff when going over the grade, drive into the column when going under a bridge, ect.  Lately my thing is slitting my wrists.  These thoughts intrigue me because I’ve always been more of a pill girl.  But recently that’s all I can think about.  It’s the last thing I think about before falling asleep.  I think about it when driving, on the computer, pretty much all the time.  I don’t want to die.  That’s not it.  I honestly don’t know what it is.  I even think about how I would do it.  If you cut cross ways you won’t die because the blood can close the clot in time.  You have to cut up the vein to actually kill yourself.  That way the blood can’t clot.  I try to figure out what my mind is telling my by these thoughts.  I sometimes think if it’s like a healing thing.  You know how in the old days they would use leaches to suck the blood of sick people because they thought sickness was carried in the blood.  By draining it you should get better.  Maybe that’s it I want to get rid of my pain and think that if I bleed it will go away.  I know it won’t.  It’ll just make things worse.  I’m trying do hard to pull my shit together.  After red’s comment I decided that I’m going to try super hard to not be so obsessed with hurting myself.  But, even after resolving to that and trying to keep my mind occupied I still thought about it 10-15 times during my drive home today (it took 45 min).  The only way I could get myself to not think about it was to think of CC, then I cried.  I swear to you guys that I really don’t want to die.  I really don’t.  I’m going to try really hard not to think about it so much.  I think it’ll get better after tomorrow.  Usually only after I talk to someone candidly about what’s bothering do I release it.  So I’m thinking that after I talk to my therapist about it I’ll feel much better about things.  On the flip side, I think I’m gonna write CC a letter telling her the whole truth about how I feel.  Maybe then I’ll be able to release that too.  And maybe it’ll be good for her as well.  I’ll talk to my therapist about this too.  Lastly, don’t be getting all upset or worried about me.  As I stated very clearly above, this is nothing new what-so-ever.  I’m not suddenly more fucked up cause I wrote this.  I’m actually much better no that I could talk a little.  I love you all!!

         My roomates are really nice, but the three of us of very different...which is fine.  The only thing is, they drink and party ALOT.  On several occasions I've been woken at 4, 5 in the morning to drunken episodes.  Last night I was really tired.  I woke up somewhat early.  Ok, it was 10:30 but I hadn't gone to bed till lat on Fri night.  Then I spent the day in Santa Cruz, then I was home for like 10 min before I left to go out to a show.  I got home exhausted at like 2, 2:30 just wanting to go to sleep.  But, there were like 10 people over all drunk.  One stumbled into my room.  Half were wearing busiers and posing for pics.  All VERY wasted.  So, I decided to be somewhat social and not be a bitch so I went out and talked a bit.  My one roomie started talking about wanted to go back to her ex who once chased her down the street with a gun.  Her best friend got mad at her and they got in a drunken argument/discussion.  The other roomate was COMPLETELY trashed and started kicking people.  I finally got to bed at like 4:30.  Falling asleep to people outside my door yellings and sluring.  Whatever.  Anyways, the kitchen is trashed.  I had to eat out for breakfast cuase i just couldn't deal.  I went out for the day and just got back hoping it would all be cleaned up.  My roomie is comatose on the couch from a hangover and the kitchen is worse.  It's fine, I'm not cleaning it up.  I also realized last night.  Well, I didn't realize, my roomate made a comment in her drunken state, right before cussing out the stove.  I haven't cleaned the apt much since moving in, so that's something I'll have to be better about.  But, when they have people over and do that to the kitchen, I'm not lifting a finger...sorry.  So, I'm a bit preterbed.  (Ok, I just got nostalgic cause that was CC's fav word).  I'm gonna go walk on the beach to detox.  P.S.  No, I didn't drink a drop last night.  Just a Dr. Pepper, which I'm not supposed to drink, but at least I won't get yelled at for it.  So, I was good.  Oh, I did have ice cram today.  It was from the ice cream man, you know with the bell on the cart.  Yeahee!!

         I'm not sure if I was pushed or if I fell.  Perhaps I even jumped.  I am in water that is much to deep to stand.  I try to keep my head up, but I keep going under.  Looking to the boat I see the shadows of my family and friends.  At first they pay no attention.  Then one notices me stuggling.  "Are you ok?" I hear.  I shout back "I'll be fine, don't worry."  I continue to struggle to keep my head up but instead start to swallow water.  A few more people take notice and begin to watch me.  One shouts "Damn it Liz, stop being so melodramatic!" and then walks away.  Another looks a moment longer and dispite his worry walks away as well.  I hear another shout critiquing my form, "You'll do better if you try the butterfly stroke.  You're not keeping your chin up enough."  "Thank you, but I'm fine" I shout back.  I countinue to swim with all my might, but get no closer to the boat.  I am swallowing more water and am getting tired, but I still insist that I am fine.  I have been here before and have always made it out with minimal injury.  The people are begining to tire of the scene before them.  One girl slips and falls twisting her ankle.  She immediatly shouts for help.  An older woman rushes to her side but keeps me in the corner of her eye.  An older man shouts at me for not comming back and that I am causing undo stress to everyone there.  I shout back my appoligies but can do nothing to apease the situation.  Looking back at the boat I see several people continuing to watch me struggle.  No one throws a lifesaver.  No one jumps in to get me.  Perhaps they are scared that they themselves will drown in an attempt to save me.  Perhaps they do not truely believe that I need any assistance.  Perhaps they know that I am strong, a survivor.  Perhaps they don't realize how tired I am.  Perhaps they are waiting for me to say that I need help, that I am not ok.  But, if this is what they are waiting for, it's never going to happen.

       I've known it forever.  There's the "funny story" of how my father was getting my mother's number while his girlfriend was in the kitchen cooking lunch.  Oh and the one where one of my dad's girlfriends showed up at the door only to meet his new fiance (my mother).  There's almost a 100% chance...  ok, I'll give hime some credit, how about a 98% chance he's cheated on my mom while they were together.  Now that she left him, the asshole won't give her a divorce, or even legal separation.  But, he will begin the search for a new woman.  Check it out, go to Match.com under username search type his name: firstlast   He has no shame, not even trying to hide it.  And his profile is bullshit.  Half of it is lies, and what the fuck is up with turnons: Money??  I know that my mom says she doesn't care, but this is just wrong.  It is so disrespectful.  This is supposed to be his love, the mother of his children, does he not have any respect?  Oh, and he's signed up for speed dating soon.  I'm just pretty pissed off.  I'll shut up now.  I guess the one thing is in his picture he looks pissed, at least that's honest.  Ok, I'm being mean now.  I'll stop.  Sorry.  No, wait.  This is what my therapist yells at me about.  I will not appoligize for how I feel.  I am mad and that's it.  Fuck you if you don't like it.

       So my commute turns out to be one hour door to door.  That's not too bad.  Could be much worse.  I'm gonna look up public transportation to see if it's workable.  I'm feeling much better.  Tired but better.  I was planning on bitching about my family, but don't feel like it right now.   later

       I guess you can probably tell that I'm not doing too hot right now.  I'm so tired even though I've been sleeping unbelievable amounts.  My head hurts and I've been having to force myself to eat for the last 2 days.  In short, I'm depressed.  I've been doing nothing all day, but I start work tomorrow so I guess that'll force me to do something.

       Well, I talked to Sugar last night.  I gave her the link to this journal cause we're close and there's nothing I can think of that I wouldn't be ok with her knowing about me.  She read it and called.  I wanted to tell her what I was thinking so bad but didn't know how.  I knew she'd read it.  Even though I wanted to, I just couldn't explain how I was feeling or what it all ment.  We just left it alone.  I think that's how I want it for now.  She said that we are friends and nothing is going to change that.  She's not concerned about what I was worried about.  She was concerned about my being sick.  I just get sick when I'm stressed.  It's been that was since at least high school, maybe earlier.  But, yesterday I was not only sick, but I also got dizzy.  Sugar made me promise to see a doctor.  I'd been planning on it for a while but haven't gone as of yet.  I will though.  I promised.  As for Bunny, it's all ok.  We were just friends.  I talked to her about Sugar a bit and brought up that talk we had a while ago about not wanting to start anything (in a casual way though).  So, we're good.  No problems.  We're putting my cat to sleep tomorrow.  This is the cat I've had since i was maybe 5 or 6.  I love her very much.  She's really sick, so we need to put her down.  I'm gonna spend the weekend at my mom's house.  I still need to pack my stuff (and bring my dirty laundry).  Vegas is planned for October 1-3.  That's my b-day weekend, so I think it'll be cool.  Everyone is welcome to join.  The hotel is on me (well, actually those time share people).  My roomate (not the pregnant one, thank god) got attacked today near our apartment while jogging.  Had to call the cops and everything.  Now I'm even more paranoid about my place.  I'm here alone right now.  I'm really tired and not feeling too good.  I think I'm gonna go to bed now.  Just a quick look for credit card imprinters.  Anyone know where I can get a cheap one?

       So, here goes......   These last few days have been very significant.&nbsp; I've touched on some stuff, but I guess it's time to actually get my thoughts together so I can figure it out.&nbsp; So, I guess I'll just go through it.&nbsp; Friday I was extreamly tired (didn't sleep more than a couple hours the night before).&nbsp; I knew I was gonna be going out with Sugar and her new (ok, it's not her girlfriend, just a girl she's seeing.&nbsp; I don't know the term for that.&nbsp; Let's call her G).&nbsp; Well, Sugar graduated a little bit ago and I wasn't able to go so I sent her flowers.&nbsp; The thing is, I really wanted to send her a cake but had a hard time finding a place that would deliver it.&nbsp; So, since I was gonna be seeing her the next day I stopped by this nice store and picked up a little (maybe 4-5 inch in diameter) cake.&nbsp; This was also right after I got my cholesterol results back so I figured we both had stuff to celebrate.&nbsp; As soon as I finished paying, I called her cause I wanted to confirm Sat.&nbsp; I would have felt like a dumb ass with a cake and then her canceling.&nbsp; She was all excited when I called, so I decided to go straight to her house from there.&nbsp; It was in the middle of traffic so it took like 2 hours and I even stopped for sparkling cider and ice cream.&nbsp; I thought I was being stupid, but I was just so excited to see her.&nbsp; I really missed her alot.&nbsp; So, we hung out.&nbsp; I already wrote about that night and Sat morning where I was getting all upset.&nbsp;   Well, sat went pretty well.&nbsp; It turns out all three of us felt like the third wheel so that was pretty weird.&nbsp; I can understand G and I feeling like one cause each of us has a very personal relationship with Sugar, but I was surprised that Sugar felt like one too.&nbsp; I think what it was is that both G and I were trying really hard to get along with the other, probably to prove that we didn't have a problem with the situation and because we knew that we were each very important to Sugar.&nbsp; So, it resulted in us talking ALOT.&nbsp; I noticed that Sugar stopped talking but couldn't figure what to make of it.&nbsp; She's told me before that she doesn't like talking alot and that she was excited that I could talk to G about politics.&nbsp; When the music got turned up I realized that it was bad, and tried to talk to her, but she didn't hear me.&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; It was an interesting day though.&nbsp; I kept reminding myself of my place.&nbsp; G was the one dating her, so I shouldn't touch Sugar in front of her cause I don't want to offend their relationship.&nbsp; I found it somewhat amusing that whenever something was just a little off with Sugar we both immediatly tried to fix it.&nbsp; When I noticed G doing it too though I reminded myself of my place and backed off.&nbsp; It was just a weird day.&nbsp; When we got back to Sugar's I was too tired to drive home (remember I only slept a couple hours for the last 3 days).&nbsp; I crashed in her spare room.&nbsp; I know I should have left, but I was just way too tired.&nbsp; The next morning I was in a half sleep when I heard someone downstairs.&nbsp; I went down hoping to get a couple min with Sugar to talk.&nbsp; Nope, so I went back to sleep.&nbsp; When she got up she talked to me for a couple min then we went downstairs.&nbsp; This was the hardest part cause I really wanted to spend time with Sugar but I knew I should leave them alone.&nbsp; That is one thing Sue made sure to teach me, always know your place.&nbsp; I stayed for a little while but knew I shouldn't be there.&nbsp; When G changed into a jersey, I knew I had to go.&nbsp; On the drive home I cried.&nbsp; I cried alot.&nbsp; Then I put on Linkin Park (for those of you who don't know, that's my angry CD.&nbsp; I only listen to it when I'm really upset).&nbsp; Luckly Gouch called me that morning.&nbsp; When I called him back, he was just so happy to hear from me.&nbsp; I asked him to see me cause I really needed someone.&nbsp; In a couple hours, Red and Gouch we at my place.&nbsp; I am just so glad that they are there for me.&nbsp; It's something so familiar and comfortable that I really need.  &nbsp; Just like old times, the three of us hung out and just acted stupid.&nbsp; I missed it so much.&nbsp; We walked around, talked about stupid shit, tried to defile a blair witch looking rock formation, learned that the antonym of Convince is Province, and were almost attacked by an evil squirle.&nbsp; I miss them so&nbsp;much.&nbsp; I think they are some of the very few people who I can just be ridiculously stupid around.&nbsp; I also talked to them about Sugar.&nbsp; They just listened and helped me figure out what to do.&nbsp; And there wasn't even&nbsp;one skank ho comment.&nbsp; I appriciate it so much.&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why I was acting so weird.&nbsp; I got Red convinced that it's cause I feel like I'm loosing a good friend.&nbsp; Gouch, however, doesn't buy it.&nbsp; He thinks I really care for her as more.&nbsp; To be quite honest, I just don't know.&nbsp; I love her very very deeply as a friend.&nbsp; Whether or not I am in love with her is yet to be determined.&nbsp; After much contemplating I have come to the conclusion though that it really doesn't matter.&nbsp; I'm not gonna fuck up things for her by making things complicated.&nbsp; I few weeks before she started dating G I tried to talk to her about it a little.&nbsp; I just didn't know how to bring it up so she thought I just didn't want to talk about it.&nbsp; I was talking about the difference between "having sex" and "making love".&nbsp; She says it's really a specturm.&nbsp; She's right, so I dropped it.&nbsp; Anyway, I called her that night (Sun)&nbsp;and we talked for just a couple mins.&nbsp; G keeps asking why we're not dating.&nbsp; I don't really have an answer.&nbsp; The one I finally settled on is that I'm so screwed up that I fuck up my relationships.&nbsp; I don't want Sugar to be a victum of that.&nbsp; I've gotten yelled at by several people for saying that.&nbsp; They say that I am being down on myself.&nbsp; But it's true that you break up with most everyone you ever date (all but maybe one).&nbsp; Those aren't good odds.&nbsp; I guess it's that I don't want to be the one to break her heart and upset her.&nbsp; I'd rather be the one who holds her if someone else does it.&nbsp; Our relationship really is great.&nbsp; There's not a whole lot to be gained by dating, but there is a whole lot to be lost.&nbsp; I couldn't talk to Sugar for long cause she had to go.&nbsp; After hanging up, I called Sage (this is the friend who tried to hook me up with the whinie chick).&nbsp; This was a disaster.&nbsp; She has screwed up girlfriend issues all the time and I listen to her almost every day while she talks.&nbsp; So, I thought she would be a good person to listen.&nbsp; She just got very loud though and kept comparing our two situations in weird ways.&nbsp; It's more like she would talk about her own shit and then add in a line to make it apply to me as well.&nbsp; But they were mostly a "she won't know what she has till she looses it".&nbsp; I told her tat it's not that though.&nbsp; It's that I don't know what I want.&nbsp; Or she would talk alot about being a doormat and that you are only worth as much as you think you are.&nbsp; Ok, good thoughts, but I don't think they apply.&nbsp; She really was yelling.&nbsp; By the time we got off the phone I had the biggest headache.&nbsp; The one line she did tell me that I think is significant it this.&nbsp; She said that it's all about risk.&nbsp; You could stay friends and risk loosing parts of her when she dates people, or you can go for her and risk loosing her all together.&nbsp; I choose the first.&nbsp; Also, I just don't know where I stand, so it would be extreamly mean of me to try to approach her asking her to give up a good thing for a maybe, I don't know how I feel.&nbsp; I want her to be happy.&nbsp; That's the number one thing.&nbsp; I'm just worried that I screwed up.&nbsp; I think that I'm turning into a whinie little bitch.&nbsp; I'm really hoping that I don't loose her over my being so screwie.&nbsp; But I guess I won't know till next time I talk to her.&nbsp; I just need to not be to clingy.&nbsp; I talked to her Sun, it's not Tue and it seems like forever since last we talked.&nbsp; That's probably cause I'm nervous about how things stand.&nbsp; I'll be better after it's all worked out.&nbsp; Overall though I feel secure in my decision to stop being a stupid ass.   Ok, here we go again.&nbsp; I already wrote about yesterday and being sick and I was gonna go to Bunny's for a Bill & Ted's double feature.&nbsp; Well, it was really fun.&nbsp; I felt bad cause their house always makes awesome Vegan food and I couldn't eat any cause I was sick.&nbsp; But it was fun though.&nbsp; The weird thing is, Bunny and I started cuddling during the movie.&nbsp; Yes, I'm fucking up...again.&nbsp; We've been close friends for a while.&nbsp; Once we both admitted that when we first met we were each like , huh.&nbsp; But we came to a decision together that there would be none of that cause we're good friends.&nbsp; Also, we both tend to get all girlie when it comes to intimatcy.&nbsp; That's probably why I'm having issues with the Sugar situation.&nbsp; Maybe my head is just getting confused.&nbsp; I'm just nervous now.&nbsp; We're going out for dinner and to a bathhouse for women tomorrow.&nbsp; I really need to be careful.&nbsp; If I fuck up relationships with TWO of my good friends in the same week, I'm gonna be PISSED!!&nbsp; What's wrong with me??&nbsp; Maybe with Bunny it's cause we were both just having a bad week.&nbsp; I talked to her about Sugar and she told me about her problems.&nbsp; Maybe it was nothing and I'm over reacting.&nbsp; I just need to be careful with what I'm doing.&nbsp; I know Bunny and she'll get very emotional very quickly.&nbsp;    urlLink   &nbsp; Trying to figure shit out&nbsp; urlLink      So, there's my weekend.&nbsp; It's been alot of thinking lately.&nbsp; I've been expecting a letter from CC, but nothing has come.&nbsp; I feel slightly bad about my last e-mail being so direct and harsh, but I then realized that it wasn't as bad as the one's she sent me.&nbsp; Also, I think it was the last post when I was talking about my little episode.&nbsp; I was thinking about it today.&nbsp; CC and I were still together at the time.&nbsp; I remember how I tried calling her when I was driving and slightly hysterical.&nbsp; She told me about her shit then said she couldn't talk cause her roomate and her were going shopping.&nbsp; She never called me back to see if I was ok.&nbsp; So, you know what....FUCK HER!!&nbsp; I don't need that shit.&nbsp; Yes, I love her but a realationship is reciprocal.&nbsp; Do I really want to be friends with someone who won't talk to me for 10 min when I need them the most, who won't even bat an eye when I'm crying?&nbsp; I'm in the process of surrounding myself with people who truely care for me.&nbsp; I can't constantly take care of everyone else when they won't do the same for me.   But just to end on a happy note.&nbsp; Elaine told my mom about our talk yesterday too.&nbsp; She was also super excited that we got along without fighting.&nbsp; Hopefully it'll stick.   One last thing, I'll talk more about it later.&nbsp; I realized that I can't do it all right now, so I WON'T be applying to grad schools this year.&nbsp; I'm gonna take a year off.   I have been typing for an hour so I think this post is long enough.   Love you!!&nbsp; (and thank you for everything)

       I have alot of emotional shit going on right now that I need to write about.  I'll do that a little bit later.  I need to leave in a couple mins and don't want to get all upset or flustered.  So, here's today for ya.   I've been feeling more and more sick these last few days.  It's been upset stomachs and cramps (NO, it's not that time of the month, but the cramps are worse than any menstal one's I've had).  I figured it was stressed and eating crappy food.  This morning though it all came to a head.  Last night my head hurt so bad I had to take 2 extra strength bayer just to lay down to go to sleep.  (Yesterday is what I have to fill you in on)  This morning I woke up crazy sick and in alot of pain.  I had work early so I was up at 5.  I didn't feel good so I just had a banana and went to work.  I could not keep my eyes open for driving.  I was totally convinced I was going to get pulled over for drunk driving cause I could not stay in my own lane for the life of me.  Well, I got to work.  Still having crazy pains.  I made it about 7-10 min then went to my car and took a nap.  I didn't wake up till I got cold and tried to grab a blanket and realized I was in my car.  Well, I went back into work (it's now 7:30, I started at 7).  I made it another 10 min then finally gave up and asked to leave.  I feel bad cause last night there was an "incident" and one of our rooms got THRASHED.  But, I figure the manager can deal with it.  So, I went to my mom's hours and slept for like 4 hours.  Woke up still sick but not as bad.  My mom asked what was wrong.  I told her I thought I got food poisoning.  But, I don't think that's it cause I've been getting slowly worse for the last couple days.  Anyway, went to my doctor (will talk about it in a min).  Then met Elaine for late lunch/early dinner.  (this was the first meal I ate since yeaterday at maybe 5).  After eating I felt sick again....FUCK.  So, I'm still not too hot, but I think that if I just don't eat anything I'll be ok.  I'm going over to Bunny's in a few min to watch a Bill & Ted's double feature.  I really want to stay home but I haven't seen her in a while and really want to.  I'm just so confused why I'm so sick.  Last time it was this bad was last summer when I was living with my dad.  I actually remember the day.  It's was the day of my freak out.  I was feeling really sick but Anne was in town and I REALLY wanted to see her.  So, we made plans for lunch dispite being sick.  I tried really hard to act fine and only had a couple spoonfulls of soup.  Then a couple min later she's pulling over to the side of the road and I'm kneeing on the pavement thowing up.  It was near a park.  There was a homeless man there giving me sympathetic looks.  I remember I was throwing up and crying at the same time.  Anne took me home.  I then got all pissed off, threw some stuff in a bag and started driving.  About 4 hours later I ended up in a Gilroy parking lot muttering.  My mom came and got me and took me back to my dad's house.   I don't understand why what is happening now should effect me like this.  Maybe it really is all the crappy food I've been eating lately.  Ok, here's some REALLY good news, actually a couple things.  First off, I actually got along with Elaine today.  We rarely get along.  I think it cause I'm trying really hard to not help her but to just be there.  It's hard cause there's so much shit I want to help her through.  But, I realize that I can't.  So, I've been trying to be more passive.  And today it really paid off.  No fights and she didn't snap at me once.  Please let this be a permanent change!! Second, my doctor apt.  It was a 3 hour exam....literally.  I had an EKG (all ok), then the Dr read my entire health history page by page.  This was a little nerve wracking.  Especially when he stopped on the "Morning after pill" page and read it like 5 times.  I also had to talk to him about some of my other shit.  I got a little misty but nothing noticable.  He said that the amount I dropped my cholesterol is comprable to what would happen with drugs.  So, he says that he sees no reason to put me on drugs.  I only have 3 risk factors; I'm overweight, family history, and high cholesterol.  I think that that's alot, be he says it's not too bad.  Oh, I had to weigh in and I guess I lost another 10 pounds.  My top weight is 205-210 last I weighed myself I was maybe 185.  Today I'm 174, very weird.  I'm not sure how that happened.  But, he says that I am still over weight so I have to loose more.  He wants to see how low I can get my cholesterol with just weight loss.  I'm seeing him again in November.  But, NO DRUGS!!!!!  YEAHEEEE!!!!  The most I'll have to go on is this stuff that's related to oat bran that you drink.  It's supposed to taste like sand.  Yuck!  But it looks like I'm ok.  So, I'm off to Bunny's.  If I'm back early enough (which is a bad sign cause it means I probably felt sick) then I'll fill you in on this weekend.  If not, tomorrow.

       I'm not feeling too hot this morning.&nbsp; After work yesterday I talked to Sugar and decided to go hang out with her.&nbsp; I crashed here and am not up much too early.&nbsp; I got about 3 (maybe 4) hours of sleep and have been staring at the wall for the past 2 hours thinking.&nbsp; I'm gonna let her sleep.&nbsp; I would take a shower but I don't know where the towels are.&nbsp; So, I'll write.  Last night was fun.&nbsp; Came over, hung out, played a board game (which I lost by absurd amounts).&nbsp; Then I got all stupid and acted like a skank ho.&nbsp; I've been thinking, I really don't know why I act stupid like that.&nbsp; I think It's like how my roomate is.&nbsp; I think she sleeps around a bit cause she's looking for attention or someone to take care of her.&nbsp; I'm not like this with everone, but maybe I'm desprate for something too.&nbsp; Maybe it's just cause I care about her alot and actually trust her.&nbsp; Maybe I'm still in the process of objectifying myself.&nbsp; Any way it is, I fucked up.&nbsp; I know that she's not gonna care cause I know she understands and cares about me.&nbsp; But I still feel like we could have had an awesome night if I didn't get all stupid and flirty.&nbsp; I really want my therapist.&nbsp; I think she'll be back soon.&nbsp; I thought I was doing really well on my own till maybe a week ago.&nbsp; I think about my grandfather ALOT.&nbsp; That was the majority of what I was thinking about this morning.&nbsp; I also though bad thoughts.&nbsp; It's been maybe a week or so I've been having issues.&nbsp; No, it has nothing to do with Sugar.&nbsp; It started right after I got back from Denver.&nbsp; I think it's cause the day we got back I started talking to my mom about my grandfather alot.&nbsp; And, my cat is dying.&nbsp; She's not doing too hot.&nbsp; Maybe I just need to morn.&nbsp; I've been trying to hold the ball for everyone.&nbsp; I'm doing so much shit at work and the last time my dad came in to yell at me was oh, yesterday.&nbsp; He was even on a trip and came straight from the airport and made me feel like shit.&nbsp; Ya.&nbsp; Oh, ya.&nbsp; He made a random lesbian comment in order to try to fuck with me.&nbsp; No, I'm not out to him.&nbsp; For a little I thought maybe he's figuring it out and trying to be supportive.&nbsp; The I realized he was trying to make fun of me.&nbsp; I'm not gonna go into it.&nbsp; Well, I've just been thinking alot lately.&nbsp; Oh, and I've been having flashes to being strangled lately too.&nbsp; I need to pull my shit together.&nbsp; I just keep thinking about things, convinced that if I think enough, everything will be solved.&nbsp; So, I thought some this morning.&nbsp; No, nothing was solved except that I'm really gonna try not to be a skank anymore.&nbsp; But I got upset and had to go to the bathroom to cry for a min.&nbsp; Bathrooms have always been my safety spot.&nbsp; When I was a kid I realized that that was the only place where I wouldn't be disturbed.&nbsp; Whenever I'm upset, I usually head for the nearest one. Ok, I'm not gonna let all this bullshit ruin my day.&nbsp; I am going to Exploritorium today, and I am gonna have fun.&nbsp; I just need a hot shower to detox and I'll be ok.

       Not even hung over, all ready for work.  I must go to the store to pick up cider and stawberries and chocolates.  We have this special where we give champagne (or cider), strawberries and whipped cream, cheese and crackers, a box of chocolates, a single red rose, and rose petals scattered on the sheets.  Someone is having a good night tonight!!  FYI safety razors don't work on sweaters.  My top needs shaved and I don't have a fabric shaver.  I tried a safety razor.  I shaved with and against the grain.  Nothing.  Doesn't work.   :(  Today will be a happy day!!  Work, Laundry, Grocery Shopping

       My friend wants to go out tonight. I got home about 30 min ago got dinner and got all fixed up. I even think I look pretty damn good. So, I'm ready ahead of time and waiting for her. I think we're going dancing. Not sure.  Ok, today ended up a pretty good day. I was frustrated this morning. I was worried that I was gonna miss the Mariot Inspection (very important), but the guy never showed. Also, I was super stressed about getting my test results back.&nbsp; Actually I was scared.&nbsp; Oh well. And ya, No ticket, yeahee!!   Ok, the burning question....my cholesterol. Yes, I totally rock!! I was wrong about the December values. It was Total: 264, Tri: 149, LDL: 179. Now....drum roll please.... Total: 211, Tri: 106, LDL: 138. These are almost normal. I brought it down by 53 points!!! That's really awesome. Hopefully I won't have to go on drugs. I was so   --------------------------------- Ok, just got back home.&nbsp; I'm a bit drunk so bear with me.&nbsp; Ok, I am SO over that friend of a friend.&nbsp; It is NOT gonna happen.&nbsp; I wasn't overly into her but thought she was really cool so figured I'd see how it went.&nbsp; She's whinie.&nbsp; Everyone knows that I like things to be all butterflies and rainbows.&nbsp; Ok, I know that it will not always be happy, and you all know my life is nowhere near that, but why stress over extra stuff.&nbsp; One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone whines and complains about stuff that doesn't need to be an issue.&nbsp; So, that was a huge turn off.&nbsp; Ok, here's my night (in a nutshell cause I'm tired).&nbsp; My friend and I were gonna go out.&nbsp; Her friend (the one who likes me) decided to come.&nbsp; Went to a bar, had 4 cosmo's, got tipsy.&nbsp; Oh, some actess girl came up and talked to me for a while.&nbsp; Nice, but very valley girl.&nbsp; Later we went dancing.&nbsp; Oh, at the bar the friend of a friend and I were getting a little bit flirty but not much.&nbsp; Then, like I said, she got whinie.&nbsp; Right before we went to the dance place, we saw someone dressed exactly like my friend was.&nbsp; We all decied to be friends and go dancing together.&nbsp; They were cool.&nbsp; At the club, the chick who liked me wouldn't dance cause she didn't like the music and kept complaining.&nbsp; Then she asked my friend's double to go have a smoke.&nbsp; I think those two were both getting there mack on.&nbsp; I was like "you can have her".&nbsp; I danced mostly with my friend.&nbsp; I would really like her if she wasn't so obsessed with this girl who she's seeing.&nbsp; The girl is screwing with her.&nbsp; I'm not gonna get into it cause it's none of my bussiness.&nbsp; But, I continue to be single.&nbsp; But hey, I looked hot.  By the way, no response from CC yet.&nbsp; And I haven't talked to Sugar today :(&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ok, have to wake up for work in a few hours so better pass out now.  Love yall!!

       Ok, I'm supposed to pick up my medical records at school this morning.&nbsp; The place opened at 8:30 so I got there at the 8:29 and went straight to the chick's office.&nbsp; Wait....wait.&nbsp; Her office is open with the lights on but no one there.&nbsp; I'm getting a little annoyed cause I'm supposed to be at work at 9.&nbsp; I knew I was gonna be late but not by too much.&nbsp; I also didn't get nearly enough sleep last night so I'm tired.&nbsp; Well, I hear the loud speaker call the chick into the conference room for a meeting.&nbsp; Great!!&nbsp; Well, I thought I'd get breakfast on campus cause I skipped this morning cause I was rushed.&nbsp; I get breakfast (tofu, hummas, and sundried tomato on a bagel...yum)&nbsp;then go back to her office at maybe 9.&nbsp; Her office door is closed....FUCK!!&nbsp; That means she did come back before the meeting.&nbsp; Well, I wait some more (glad I paid till 9:30 on my parking permit).&nbsp; After&nbsp;about 10-15 min some guy working in the office next door asks what I'm waiting for (yes, I'm sitting in front of a closed office door).&nbsp; He looks it up and the meeting isn't supposed to end till 9:30 and they run late.&nbsp; Damn it.&nbsp; No I have to kill like a half hour.&nbsp; My parking permit has no expired.&nbsp; I debating whether to hike back to my car to pay some more or risk a ticket.&nbsp; If I get a ticket, I'll be pissed.&nbsp; And I'm on campus in my work clothes and my hair all up in a bun.&nbsp; I look like a dumb ass.&nbsp; The guy told me to come back at 9:45 at the earliest.&nbsp; I guess I will go back to my car and pay the extra money.&nbsp;&nbsp; FUCK!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm gonna be about 2 hours late to work.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;the one good thing.&nbsp; Next semester, I'm paid for full time and I decided to only go part time, so I turned in my refund request.&nbsp; Yeahee, productive!!&nbsp; Ok, I&nbsp;gotta get to my car before the parking people do.&nbsp; Hopefully when I get back the chick will be out of the meeting and I can get my records.  Today&nbsp;WILL be a good day, DAMN IT!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Today was crazy at work.  The morning was slow and there was only one clerk working.  I was back up.  He asked to leave early since it was slow, so I told him I'd cover him.  After that, the shit hit the fan.  There was alot of random stuff I won't go into cause you know how much I talk and I want to keep this entry under 1000 pages.  One interesting one was this one guy whose been staying for a couple days now.  Every day he comes down and pays cash for one night so is checkout date is always the next day.  Yesterday he wouldn't come down to pay and he wouldn't answer the phone or the door (they were pounding on it) but his curtains were open and he was just lying on the bed, naked.  We had to send someone into the room to make sure he wasn't dead.  Well, I guess today he ran out of cash.  He says he'll bring it by at 6 tonight.  So, if he hasn't paid by the time I get into work tomorrow, I have to call the cops.  Yes, it seems excessive but that's what they told me to do.  I gues I'm not gonna tackle a naked man myself and get all his shit out.  Another thing I feel bad about is a woman who's staying there cause her boyfriend beat her up.  There's been a few troubles with her room and she's breaking down every time I talk to her.  I gave her a free night tonight.  I told her that I understand completely.  In other news, I think I'm going out with that friend of a friend on Sun.  I'm slightly weary cause we've been talking alot.  I'm worried that she might be the type to rush into something.  I want to chill a bit.  She seems cool though.  We get along and have alot in common (we both suck at geography).  And, no I have not spoken to scary public transportation chick.  Sat I'm going to Exploritorium with Sugar and this woman she's seeing.  I'm super excited cause I like to play (as you all know.   oh, she's gonna bring a camera, yeahee!!).  And I want to meet the woman.  Sugar and I have gotten really close.  It's so hard to explain.  Red, I think you would use the term "psudo girlfriend".  I talk to her like every day.  I didn't talk to her for 2 days this week and flipped out wondering if something happened.  I care about her a whole lot.  I'm really excited that maybe she found someone cool who will treat her right.  I will admit, that the selfish bitch part of me is a little tiny bit jealous.  But, I care about her too much for that to influence my thoughts in any way.  So far I really like the woman, fingers crossed!!  oh, I got a "FUCK BUSH" bumber sticker.....on a purple background.  Go me!!  Very cool.  But as we learned in driving improvement school the first time (the total is 3 times for those of you who lost count) cops really will find reasons to pull you over if you piss them off (they've admitted to it).  And displaying contoversial stuff can piss them off.  So, no displaying of profanities on the car  :(    I guess it'll go in my room.  c'est la vie  (yes, I am pretty sure the spelling is wrong, blow me)  That's it for today.  I get my blood test back tomorrow.   Please let it be good!!

       I pulled all my blood tests and realize that my cholesterol has sucked for a while. The total is supposed to be under 170, tri less than 100, I can't remember the LDL I'm supposed to have. Here are my values  Date (Age)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDL  9/93 (13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 177&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?  9/94 (14)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;211&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?  9/95 (15)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 161  9/96 (16)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 215&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 132  12/97 (18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 172&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 171  6/98 (18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 259&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 204&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 143  6/99 (19)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 263&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 170  8/00 (20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;221&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 147  9/01 (21)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 285&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 176  4/03 (23)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 239&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 172  12/03 (24)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *258* I'm getting my lab report copied this week, I think this was it, but not sure.   I am taking bets as to what my current cholesterol is. I had a test last week but don't know the results yet. Elaine says 195, my mom says 203, Sue says in the 230's. I'm saying maybe 213 (random guess, I would say 230's but Sue already claimed it). I really hope it improved enough that I don't have to go on drugs. Fingers crossed.

       This weekend I went to Denver for Sue's art exhibit. It was a really good weekend. Ellaine only got angry for about half of each day, which is really good. It was really nice to be able to chill with Sue for a while. I haven't seen her since March. The piece that was displayed was called "Severe Sadness" (self portrait). She took it when she was like 17. It's always been a key piece in her portfolio, so it was cool to finally see it displayed in a real live art exhibit. I'm not gonna go into details of the trip cause it would take forever.   I think the key thing lately has heen remembering old shit. All the problems with my aunt and cousins are making me remember my childhood. I've been talking about it with my mom a little. It almost like watching how things were when I was young. But, there's nothing you can do about it. I've been thinking about Sue's photgraphy and my relationship with her alot. And most of all, I've been thinking about my grandfather. I miss him. I love him so much. I'm not angry that they took him off the resperator. That's not it. I'm angry about everything surrounding it. His death was used as a power card within the family. There was so much shit surrounding it I can't even explain. At the funeral, when I looked at my father I saw evil. You know when it's almost like you see an aura. His was just bad. I know he's sick. I do know that. That is why I don't hate him. I know that it's not him when he does bad things. I know he can't help himself. It just hurts. I wish that I could talk to him. I wish that there was just one thing that I could express to him that he would understand. I try to be logical, but it doesn't work. He doesn't think logically. There's nothing I can do about that (believe me, I've tried). Just like my cousins, I just have to step back and watch him deteriorate. I wish there was something I could do. I would do anything for him. I know that I'm not doing engineering like he said. So I guess that's not everything, but I know that he'd be unhappy with whatever I chose. I know that it's ok, but I'm really not happy with the events surrounding my grandfather's death. I know that I have to let go. I don't know what to feel though. I'm angry and I don't want to be. I want to forgive and forget. I know that he doesn't want me to be mad. I'm going to try really hard. I've just been thinking about him alot lately. I've been crying alot too. I want to hold his hand so bad that I can feeling in in mine sometimes.   I have my cardiologist apt on Monday. I need to bring all my medical records with me so I've sent out all my requests. I've got them all but my school ones for just this past year (bastards want $15 to copy them. no one else asked for money). It's trippy cause I got all the ones from college. I flipped thru them. All the records from my past shit is there. The morning after pill and the full STD screenings. It just reminded me of bad shit. I want to pull that out cause it is a heart doctor after all, but I don't know wheter that pill effects anything. I know that I got pretty damn sick for a few days cause of it. I remember when it was perscribed, as though I didn't feel like shit enough, the phamicist through the perscription at me (it's a small, christian centered town). I guess you can't just forget. Maybe I should just pull the pages out and shred them. I can control the records for all future doctors, and the originals will get destroyed when the statute runs out. Is it that easy to erase history? Maybe if you get rid of all evidance, it will be like nothing ever happened.   On a random note. Back when I was living in Pacifica, I used to take the bus every day. There was this one girl who would be on it too sometimes. She is the exact ideal of what I'm attracted to. I wanted to talk to her so bad, but never got any further than a smile. I have a tendancy of liking people who I won't talk to for fear of them kicking my ass. You know, hard ass girls. That's something I have to work on. Well, I moved and stopped taking that bus. I saw her on muni a couple times but chickened out of talking to her. Well, last night I stayed at my mom's cause the flight got in last night. This morning when walking to my car for work, she was walking my mom's neighbor's dogs. I guess she's house sitting for her. I wanted to talk to her, but I had no excuse to go over there. Isn't that a bit much of a coincidence? Ok, next time I see her, I will talk to her. Red, you should know who this is, I used to tell you about the mean looking girl on the bus who I thought was hot.   Lastly, I got to sit in on yet another argument between my parents. It was disguised as a "meeting" so I couldn't leave. I don't want to get into it. Nice start to the day though.   Oh, and my friend who is trying to hook me up with her friend called me on my way home. The two of them came over and hung out for a while. It was RIGHT after I got home from work though. I didn't even have my shoes off. So, I'm not sure how well I did. I think my feet smell. I worked a 10 hour day today. She's cool though. We'll see how it goes.&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a little too long to use the bathroom in my room.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure she was going though my cupboards.&nbsp; I can't hold that against her though, cause I would do the same.  Also, my roomate is pregnant. She's had one abortion before. This would be the 2nd. She's going to the Dr. tomorrow to confirm. And the one who got her pregnant is this guy (with herpes) who she sleeps with but definially does not want to date. She doesn't really like him much.   Ok, I have to work tomorrow. And I need to call this one chick to have dinner. I don't overly want to, but I have her book and need to return it. I'll call her tomorrow and see if she wants to meet for dinner after I get off work.   Last dilema. I'm really hungry but need to go to sleep. Get a quick snack, or go to bed hungry?

       Ok, we're leaving for Denver in an hour and a half so I went to my mom's house to meet them.  No one is here.  huh.  Theie suitcases are packed and in the kitchen but both my mom and Elaine are out.  I guess I'll just wait here (I got chocolate milk!!).  The other day I went to this shi shi jazz club cause my friend was performing.  You know that chick who played at pride who I used to go out with a little and whom I really like.  Ya, she sings at this one jazz club.  It was totally fun.  I think we were the most under dressed there.  It was super expensive.  I order a Grey Goose Cranberry (well liquor frightens me).  It was $9!!  But at least they made it good.  Well, I got to see lawyer chick (singer).  She looks a bit different but still really cool.  She is dating someone though so no luck there.  Her brother was there too and he remembered me.  Well, I went with my one friend (who also knows lawyer chick from a totally different situation) and her best friend who lives in the East Bay.  Her friend was totally cool.  I wasn't super interested cause I was busy drooling over lawyer chick.  My friend kept nudging me to talk to her friend more and after a little while I realized that she was trying to hook us up, huh.  I got a little tipsy (for $9 i better feel something) and started relaxing and we talked a little.  I'm very proud of myself though.  I didn't make an ass out of myself at all.  I was very careful to watch what I said.  Well, last night my friend called me to come hang out (she lives like 5 min away).  We hung out, watched the 5th wheel (yeahee!!).  She told me that her friend really liked me and wants to go out and said to give me her number.  While we were hanging out last night though her friend calls and we talk on the phone a little bit.  I told her that when I get back from CO I'll call her and we'll get together.  That was unexpected.  I must be getting better at something, just not sure what.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm taking bets as to how many dates till I fuck it up.  I vote 2.  Ok, no negativity....sorry.  I am awesome and everyone wants me, oh yes!!     (P.S.  Snoring really is sexy.  I realized this last night.  My friend kept drifting off and snoring.  Then she'd wake up and appologize.  There's nothing to appologize for, that really is sexy.  Ok, not when you're trying to sleep yourself, but it's a gentle, pure, relaxed act...very cute.  Think about it.)

       Well, I'm waiting for my laundry so I figured it's a good time to update my journal.  I'm trying to figure out what's happed since last time.  Well, I went to Marine World with my two little cousins (I'll call them Older one (OO) and Younger One (YO)).  I don't like to support animals in captivity, but make an exception when it comes to taking my family out.  At the gates there were a couple people protesting and handing out flyers.  I secretly wanted to run up to them and hug them and thank them for their effort cause animals should not be in captivity.  But, instead I directed my cousins' eyes so that they wouldn't see the protesters and have their day ruined.  Marine World used to be about education.  In the shows, they would tell you about the animal and the natural behaviors and encourage people to help protect them.  When this is the purpose, I can tollerate their imprisionment because it is for a good cause.  When the animal is used purely for entertainment like a circus monkey, that is very NOT ok.  The tiger show did teach you about the animal and they did encourage everyone to help fight poachers and donate to organizations that protect the animals.  I'm fine with this.  I'm not happy about the enclosures being so small, but there is a purpose to the show.  On the other hand, I am extreamly distraught by the whale show.  They have a new whale named Shouka (something like that).  This show almost brought me to tears.  The poor whale just kept swimming around in that small tank splashing people.  You know how at the shows they have a "splash zone" where you may get wet.  Well, I know that people fight for those seats and they love getting wet.  I think that Six Flags is trying to capitalize on this fact.  The entire show was just trying to get the audiance wet.  There was no education what so ever.  No explaination about whether whales are fish or mammels, air breathers, blow hole function, bone structure, species, ability to survive outside of water, hearing, vision, ect...  These used to all be very basic things that they teach you about at any animal show.  No, the poor thing just kept swimming in circles and throwing water on people.  And it's fin was stating to curve over already.  You know how in "Free Willy" the whale's fin is bent over.  Well, Shouka's is starting to also.  And, that tank is in no way big enough.  Ok, there's my animal rights rant.  I went with my two cousins, OO and YO.  I know that alot of shit has been happening in their family and there's lots of stress.  I'm really worried about them.  Their mom is my fav aunt.  She is the only one I can actually be honest with.  I think it's cause she came to the US when she was 22.  She had major issues with my father (her brother) becuse he's controling.  She ended up disappearing and not talking to him for years.  So, she understands my dad and how he is with us.  Anyway, I love and spoil my two cousins ridiculous amounts.  They are 10 and 12 now (I remember holding them in the hospital).  I am worried about them though.  OO has a werd tick and acts a bit off.  He's had it for a long while now.  I'm worried cause I know that he was beaten as a baby when still in the crib.  I was worried that it may be some damage, but recently figured out it's from stress.  Those two kids have so much stress.  YO has thrown up from stress and OO has the tick.  I know that their parents put alot of pressure on them.  I didn't realize the extent until recently.  First, my uncle has gotten abusive.  I know for sure he's beat my aunt and the cops have come.  I'm not sure about the kids.  Second, there is ALOT of pressure about school.  The stereotypical Indian way is that the ONLY acceptable careers are Doctor, Lawyer (lawyer is more recently "approved"), Computers, Engineer, own your own business.  That's why I get so much shit from my dad.  I'm switching from an acceptable to an unacceptable career.  Ok, where was I (laundry finished and folded, go me!!  Also just got back from my friend's house, will update later).  Back to OO and YO.  I know that they have crazy pressure.  Ever since they were born they were told that one had to be a doctor, one a lawyer.  They get in trouble if they get anything less than straight A's (no A-'s).  In fact, they are telling YO that he is lazy and stupid cause he gets B's once in a while (last I saw he only had one).  Right now OO is in a apecial summer program where he does Algebra for 8 hours a day.  There is no reason on earth any 12 year old should spend 8 hours a day, 7 days a week doing math during his entire summer break.  He's only 12 damnit!!!  It's really bothering me and I sense that the shit is gonna hit the fan soon with him.  When he was younger he was very violent (at one point he wasn't allowed to be around YO cause he was trying to hurt him real bad).  OO is also obsessed with Sulfuric Acid right now.  It's weird.  I can take that 2 ways.  First, he's seriously depressed.  When I was that age and depressed, I was overly concered with destructive things.  Second, he just liked chemistry.  This sucks too cause there's no way he's gonna be able to persue it.  I just worry.  I love them so much.  I want to give them my cell number and tell them to call me if things go bad or if they need to talk.  But, this is how the last family war started.  No one is supposed to encourage children to disobey their parents.  I just have to sit back and watch to see what happens.  I get mad that my aunt uses me to push them.  She started saying things like "See, Liz is going to be a doctor, she's getting her PhD.  We'll have to call her DR".  What she doesn't say is that in elementary school I got "F's" on my report card.  I was in remedial math till high school.  I'm disobeying my father to get that PhD.  And I am doing my own shit and having a life while I do school.  I'm so scared that OO is gonna turn bad again.  If he did, I wouldn't blame him.  It's not right what they're doing to those kids.  Alot of it reminds me of my childhood, but alot of it is worse too.  I guess I'll just wait and see what happens.  But Jr. High is when all kids go psycho.  Right now OO has a head start (he really is off, but I don't want to ellaborate out of respect for him) and YO is quickly loosing his self esteem.  When talking about YO tbe conversation actually at one point went to "well, he must be good at something".  He is the sweetest kid ever.  And those two truely are the smartest children I have ever met in my life.  I just wish their parents would stop fucking with their self esteem.     Other news, Archie sent another mass e-mail (they go to my trash but i still read them.  I don't know why).  His little sickness is some virus only one in a gizillion (I don't remember the number) get.  It's super rare.  It's karma I tell you.  I'm going to CO tomorrow for the weekend.  I'm super psyched.  I'll fill you in later on that.  I also have to tell you about my woman situation.  Oh, and I'm now "assistant manager"....wooohoo!!  more hours, more work, same pay.  It's cool though.  I'm actually likeing it.  Well, time for bed!!  *kisses*

       Ok, before I get replies yelling at me about my reply I'll say that this has NOT been sent yet.  I will be sending it today though, so give me some input.  Sugar says that I need to grow balls (yuckie visual..ewww) and be straightforward with CC.  How's this??  Let me know ASAP if you have any comments I should hear before sending.   CC,    I really do want to be friends with you, but from what you wrote it's apparent that you still have feelings for me.  I fear that if we try to be just friends you may be thinking that we have a chance of a relationship again.  I want to make it very clear that we will not be getting back together again.  I don't want to put you through any excess stress or pain.  I will leave it up to you to decide whether you can deal with a purely platonic relationship.    -Liz-       Thanks yall!

       My other boss from HI wrote back too.  He said he'll give me a recomendation letter too, but later (what exactly does that mean?).  But, he sent me pics of my baby.  This is the project that I was in charge of.  It's a 6 building complex.  Oh, I do love it so.  It's still under construction, but starting to wrap up.  *tear*    urlLink    1&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    2&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    3&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    4&nbsp; urlLink

       I want to go to bed and my crazy neighbor always yells and cusses to herself.  The head of my bed is against the wall I share with her.  She wakes me up many a night with her yelling.  I think I should give her some Kava Kava.

       So, my official job at work is not "clean up chick".  Everything is disorganized and fucked up.  I'm suppossed to fix it.  Yesterday I spent 9 hours cleaning off the office computer.  I thought I found all the Britney Porn but today I found two more folders filled with it.  Ok, that better be all of it.  I hope there weren't any significant computer files that I deleated.  I don't think microsoft makes the XXX Hard Core program, do they?  Today I started on the file cabinets.  There are like 10 file cabinets filled with paperwork, none is filed.  It took 8 hours to get one drawer almost sorted.  This is going to seriously blow.  And I haven't been able to study for the GRE.  I really need to get going.  I work tomorrow night, so I'll have some time in the morning.  I also have to clean though.  I've been a total slacker with the cleaning in the apartment.  I know that I'm on the verge of a "talk" from my roomates, so I figure I'll clean the kitchen tomorrow and vacuum.  That should buy me some time.  I'll aim for the GRE at the end of the month.  My math rocks, english sucks....totally!!  I also have to request all my medical records cause that heart doctor want 5 years of everything.  That means SLO, HI, SF, snd SJ.  Oh, and my car insurance is due.  I think I can get cheaper from Costco so gotta look into that too (before the 26th).  I still haven't written back CC yet.  Mostly cause I just don't want to deal with it.  I feel a little guilty not writing back quickly though cause it takes her hours to wait for a computer and then she checks and nothing.  I was thinking of writting her tonight but I'm a bit tired and we all know what a mess I made last time I wrote her when I was tired.  But, I did write someone else.  I wrote actually a couple people from my old company in HI.  My ex-boss is gonna give me a letter of recomendation.  Yeahee!!!  I'm hoping that a reference from a real world company will help with grad school applications.  I really want Stanford or Berkley, but unless I get some study time....   Other random stuff.  I haven't been very good about watching my diet, but I'm not craving or liking the "bad" stuff any more.  Well, except the sweets.  But I'm on the rag (yes red, TMI) so I'm allowed.  And coffee addiction is concored.  Today I hade maybe a 1/4 cup of coffee (I forgot about it).  I needed a cup of tea later but that's really good  :)   I'm not sure how I feel about those sideways happy faces.  They seem odd.   Other thing.  I think that I'm gonna send a letter of support to live 105 for playing Howard Stern.  I don't like Howard.  I find him vulger and offensive, but banning him is an attack on freedom of speech.  I appriciate 105's efforts to protect our rights and fight censorship of public radio.  I don't like the show, so I switch the station when it comes on, is that really that hard of a thing to do.  Why does everything have to be f*c*i*g censored?  Also, from the 2 sentences I heard when flipping past it this morning, I realized that that show does support women's roles outside of those tradionally mandated by society.  Kudos to Howard!!   Yes, I have an hour commute each way to/from work...I think about random shit.   This weekend I'm taking my two little cousins to Marine World.  I am VERY excited.  Elaine and I took them to Great America last year.  The older one and I went on all the roller coasters till I was about sick and Elaine took the youner one cause she doesn't like roller coasters and he wasn't tall enough.  This year we're going to Marine World so that while I take the boys on the roller coasters (the younger one should be tall enough) she can see the animal shows with her friend who's comming with us.  I'm super excited Elaine's friend is comming.  I want her to meet some people who are nice and who she can spend some time with.  This should be a good opportunity.  I'm a bit nervous about the coasters.  My stomach isn't as strong as it used to be.  I need little breaks between rides.  But, that's what lines are for.   I've been feeling bad about one thing though.  My friend, Sugar, is graduating this Friday.  I really want to go, but Sat I have to drive like 3 hours with my cousins (I drive VERY differently when they're in the car) and spend the day on coasters.  So, I need sleep.  If I go to the east bay Fri I know that I'll end up crashing there, and I know that I'll get a max of 4 hours sleep.  So, in short I can't go.  I'm disappointed.  I promised her that I'll take her to dinner to celebrate.  I really love Sugar.  I haven't known her for too long but I just seemed to click with her right away.  I think that she's alot like me.  I may just be on crack but I feel like I really know her.  and I feel like she knows me too.  When we first met, the first thing we found in common is that we both have a tendancy to be attacked by wild animals.  And you thought I was the only one.  Ok, contemplation.....  It's 9.  I'm tired (didn't sleep last night, even after taking sleeping pills).  But I'm working night tomorrow so if I wake up early I may get tired early and won't get home till after 10.  Bed.....wake......bed....wake....bed.....wake.....bed  I think I'm gonna go to bed.

       Just got home from work a little bit ago.  I'm tired and just want to take a shower and chill a bit.  It's my roomate's B-day so I gotta be social.  I knew today would be bad.  I had to work the morning shift by myself the day after a holiday.  I knew alot of guests would be pissed and it would be crazy.  Elaine said that she'd come work with me so that I have some back up.  She's worked desk before so I thought it would be help.  No.  She didn't know how to do anything, which is fine.  But, she got mad and pissy at me when I tried to show her.  I also got a new girl to train today.  She was supposed to work the 7-3 with me.  She showed up at 9:30 and left at 12:30.  She just did her homework the whole time.  If I tried to show her anything she'd tell me to wait.  So, I had to do desk, babysit 2 trainies (I have no problem training as long as they actually work), and I had to do airport runs (didn't get lost this time, go me!!).  Ok, on top of that, someone stole the food storage keys and maid keys and ransacked (yes, ransacked.  As in things being thrown about and stuff stolen) the storage closets.  The keys were found near the jacuzzi.  And another keychain was stolen.  All the maintanence people ALL decided to take the day off.  No keys to the maintenence room.  We ran out of keys and could make any cause the machine is in the maintenence room.  Finally we got in and made keys, but the codes were wrong so all the keys opened the wrong doors.  On a good side, one room which had MAJOR problems and no one fixed them.  They've been mad and complaining for about a week.  They checked out today and were pissed (and rightly so).  The good part of today is I made them happy in the end, it cost about $168, but they left not mad.  Yeah for me!!  We also had lots of room transfers cause of problems (and remember, no maintenence to fix it).  And, of course, the icing on the cake.  My dad (would you expect any less?).  He showed up and stayed for a while.  I think just to make sure my day got completely fucked up.  He screamed and cussed me out....ALOT.  This includes when I'm behind the desk, around the chick I'm training, and in front of housekeeping.  I came very close to quitting and saying fuck you.  But, I'm the good little daughter, so I will continue to be a punching bag.  A couple times he got close and I was like "oooh, is he really gonna hit me at work?  This'll be interesting.  Would I get the rest of the day off?"  But he didn't.  Oh well, whatever.  I'm so waiting for him to beat my ass so that I have an excuse to say fuck you.  But, like I said, I'll just be the good daughter till then.  Well, maybe not good.  He makes sure that we know how bad we are.  I talked to Sue (my sister) on the way home today.  When she called to wish him happy father's day last week they got in a huge fight cause he thinks that she's such a bad daughter.  I don't think I could tell you what he said to me today if I tried.  He get's kinda crazy and rants incoherently.  Let's see if I can get some of it.  I'm critical, no help, abandoning, you know what, fuck this.  I'm not gonna do this to myself.  I know that I'm doing the right thing.  There is absolutally nothing more I can do for him.  I am content with helping him out during this time.  I just wish I would get cussed out at work in front of people who I am supposed to be supervising.  On a good note, this past weekend was good.  I'll write about it later though.  I want a cool shower put on my pjs and chill for a while.

       I am just finishing up a 16 hour day.  I am oh so tired.  I woke up before 5:30 to get to work early (and stop at the store on the way there to pick up flowers and cookies for a meeting being held at work.  Get to work and set up the room for the meeting.  Barely made it.  Brought in the drinks after they arrived.  Pretty good timing though.  Then my dad stopped by and was an ass as always.  I feel bad cause I know he doesn't mean to be one.  It's not his fault that his very presence upsets me to the point I can't function for the rest of the day.  Well, maybe it's kinda his fault, but he doesn't understand.  But, I'm really not wanting to get into it.  The internet guy for the company got moved to my location.  He likes to spend his days annoying me by comming up to me every 5 min and talking to me about what he's working on, or asking me to pull a file.    Anyway I was psyched when I got to go on a Costco/Smart & Final/Bank run.  I get lost on the way to S & F then my car breaks...yes, again.  I was stranded in San Jose most of the day.  I just got home.  My brakes are "fixed", but apparently, something called a buffing is gonna break soon so I'm gonna have to get that repaired too.  The mechanic let me go under the car to look though, Yeahee!!  I actaually have some interesting stuff to say, but I'm tired.  I think I need to sleep.  I'm starting to contemplate whether this would be a good time to start saving for a car.  Mine is having problems way too often.  I need sleep.

       I'm up at the butt crack of dawn cause I have to be at work early.  Woo hoo!!  Quick update:  Everything is pretty good.  I almost got in ANOTHER car accident yesterday.  With a brand new shiny Civic.  On the freeway everyone slammed on their brakes (Was I tailgating?).  It was one of those things that you don't know if you actually hit their car or not.  I think I stopped a couple inches shy.  Anyways.  I got all shook up and decided to take side streets for some time.  Yes, between SF and South Bay.  It's interesting at one red light I looked around and was like "Shit, this is where my Uncle lives, like 3 blocks away".  Our families stopped talking about 10 years ago.  I saw my one cousin just once when we went to the same college, and didn't see anyone else till my grandfather's funeral.  That's why it's so important I go to that wedding next month.  We weren't invited to the weddings of the other two cousins, so it will be VERY bad if we don't go now.  Ok, what else....  At work, our pay per view in the room got pulled so now we're gonna have movies they can rent at the desk.  I'm gonna go to Hollywood or Blockbuster to get some Previously Viewed regular movies, but I need porn!!  Porn seems to go better...go figure.  So I need to get me some used porn.  If anyone knows of anywhere, let me know.  Must be clean. Ok, off to work I go.  (at least I get out early since I'm going in early).  After work I need to go grocery shopping and do laundry.  I'm spending the day with Sugar tomorrow!!

       I was ridiculously pissed off yesterday and today. I was planning on writing about it, but I have resolved my feelings...I think. I don't want to go into it cause I'm all ok now and don't want to get thinking before bed. It had to do with Sugar. But, we talked for like an hour and I think I got everything off my chest, so there's nothing else I need to say right now. And I only had one glass of wine, so no lectures. I'm sorry I get like that. I'm having trouble lately figuring out how to deal with my feelings. I usually just bottle them up or stuff them down and not deal with them. Now I'm trying to face them. It just gets hard cause I don't always know what to do.  Sometimes I feel like I'm screwing up, but honestly this is the healthiest I've been both mentally and physically in a long time.  Ya, I'm thinking about more stuff.  But, isn't it better to think about and deal with things than to not?  My therapist says that I'm seeing the world in a different way.  I'm seeing things I never saw before.  I think she's right. I miss you guys.

       I had a shitty ass day today.  Didn't sleep last night cause I was thinking.  I was pissed off all day today.  I even had a drink at lunch (Is it bad when you hit the tequila before noon?).  And why is it whenever you're tired, your cell phone dies?  I don't get it. It was also my roomate's thing today so I stopped on the way home and picked up 2 kinds of cookies, pound cake, brownies, ice cream, flowers, and of course some wine.  Yes, I need to fill you in on what's going on, but first I need a drink.  Please don't think any less of me.  I'll try to write about it tonight.  Love ya!!

       Well, just got home.  I was planning on having a "me" day, but decided that I didn't want to think.  I almost started crying on the way to therapy.  Not sure why.  I'm driving, look left and see a homeless man pushing a shopping cart up the hill, get all misty.  At therapy it was mostly a recap of my month.  We spent some time on my mom this time though.  I don't talk very often about problems between my mother and I.  Well, afterwards I was fragile and knew if I was by myself I would think too much.  I went to Sugar's place.  We hung out for the day.  It was really nice.  We talked alot and got alot of stuff in the open (I will discuss tomorrow when I'm not so tired).  I'm really glad we hung out today.  The drive home sucked.  Keep in mind she lives about an hour and 8 freeways away.  Well first a bag flies into my window and won't go away for a while, then I hear a pop on the driver's side of my car (I hope it was just a hubcap, but forgot to check when I got home), then almost got in an accident (going 90) with a cab (had to slam on my brakes and swerve, luckly no one was in the next lane just then), then I'm shook up and don't pay attention and come too close for comfort between a semi and an SUV, then get stuck behind a swerving car doing 50, and then get stuck behind a car doing 40.  I'm just glad I'm home.  I want to sleep.  I have lots to fill you in on, but not tonight.  Love You!!

       Today I filed...for 8 hours.  I got 1 whole drawer of 1 filing cabinet almost organized.  My back is killing me.  Today I was pretty depressed.  I had to foce myself to eat breakfast.  I just had some cottage cheese.  Then come lunch all I want is sweets.  I had a Mc Donalds hot fudge sundae and a cookie.  Now I want more sweets.  I had a good dinner though.  I got creative.  I wanted cous cous with tofu but didn't have anything to cook the tofu in.  I pan fried it in seaseme oil then added tahini, soy sauce (yes, I'm using it...I'm surprised too), garlic, and wheat germ.  Surprisingly it turned out really good.  Go me!!  Oh, today I was very proud of my mom.  I think I said before that Curves is owed by some Pro-Life religious organization.  My mom joined one of the Curves knock offs.  I'm very happy about that, but not only that, she had a doctor apt this morning.  Her doctor goes to curves.  My mom told her about the Pro-Life connections and convinced her to switch gyms.  Go mom!!  She is doing her part to oppose the religious right!! *fist in air*  I also talked to her a little today about wanted to come out to Elaine.  My mom is getting much more accepting.  She's always been accepting, but the negative undertones are less.  She is actually ok with me telling Elaine.  When I first came out she treatened me that I wasn't to tell her.  I also saw my dad for a couple min.  He wasn't too bad.  Said some things that I think are disrespectful to my mom, but nothing too extreame.  But like I said, for some reason I'm sad today.  I think that it's about my cat.  Whenever something happens to one of our animals I always get bitter towards my father and just overall pissed off.  See, my dad hated the pets.  He was the one who got them for us but then after a couple years started hating them.  He actually bullied my mom into putting our dog to sleep.  She was getting older but we wouldn't have done it if it weren't for his threats.  When it happened, I was the only one of the three of us who knew what happened.  My two sisters thought she died in her sleep.  I was sworn to secrecy.  I've always had a back and forth relationship with religion.  At that time though I thought that I was an evil murderer and going to hell.  But I couldn't talk to anyone about it so I just did my self hating shit.  I try to tell myself that she was in pain, but she really shouldn't have died then.  Also, with my cats.  My dad has tried to poison them.  They refused to eat the food though.  He also tried to catch them a few times.  Not sure where he was planning on taking them.  I don't want to know.  But, they got away.  So, I know it's irrational but the fact that my cat is dead makes me mad at him because this is what he wanted.  And I don't want him to find out cause I don't want him to rub it in my face or even worse pretend to care then smile.  Even a year after my mom left him, every time he talked to me he would mention how horrible his life was because my mom forced him to live with the cats.  He suffered every minute of every day.  I know I get crazy about things some times.  Also at work we were dealing with a woman named "Cathy" to set up a contract.  I hate that name with a passion.  Every time I hear it I get angry and bitter.  It was the name of my father's "secretary".  She really helped to fuck up our family.  I truely hate her.  She's one of those people who (when she was around) my sister and I would spend hours just thinking of evil things to do to her.  Red laughs cause I actually call her "Cathy I hate her"  It's like it's her full name cause it always comes together.  Ok, other news ????   I got a pin that says "Evil Wench"  and it's pink!!  My therapist is back tomorrow.  I'm gonna go 2x this week cause I'll probably need it.  I'm trying to stay home a bit this week.  Wed is my roomate's thingie.  I'm trying to be there for her.  It's hard though cause I have so much of my own shit.  I'm really trying though.  I'm off work tomorrw and have nothing to do.  I was thinking about going to work anyway to keep my mind busy, but I think I'll take the day for myself.  Sugar invited me to hang out with her then but I think it's a better idea to have some me chill time.  I'll probably end up cleaning my room.

       Well, another weekend gone. Back to work tomorrow. I was supposed to work today but diched out. I know it's very unprofessional of me, but I need the day off. Friday after work my aunt called me cause she and my 2 little cousins were nearby swimming. I met up with them and talked a bit. I enjoyed seeing them but was upset by a couple things my aunt said. I don't understand, she didn't used to be like this. Well, she called my little cousin lazy a few times cause he doesn't get top grades. Then she made some racist comments. Nothing too blatent, but enough for me not to repeat them here cause they'll offend at least 4 of you personally (and keep in mind, not many people read this blog). I don't get it. She was always the cool one in terms of my relatives. I guess abusive relationships fuck you up in lots of different ways.  Well, Sugar called me. I was overjoyed. We're hanging out this comming weekend. I promissed her I'll cook Indian food. She's never had Indian food before. Ya, my cooking is going to be her first experience. Wow, the pressure. But, she know's I only have a 50% sucess rate, so there shouldn't bee too big of a surprise if I burn the nan. I am excited to cook for her though. I haven't cooked a big meal for anyone in a while. I'm just debating whether to make chana (good and easy) or matter paneer (my favorite but easy to screw up). I'm thinking the paneer just cause it is my fav.  Friday night we put my cat to sleep. I wanted to inset a pic of her, but I don't have any scanned. I love her so much. She was 18 1/2. I know that she was in alot of pain, so I'm not upset that she's gone. In fact, when it was happening, she just layed on her side, she didn't even wince when they were putting in the needle. I know she's better now. She gets to be like a kitten again. I just need a min to feel sad.  I also decided that I want to come out to Elaine. We're getting along alot better. By the end of any time together she starts to get short with me, but I've been able to end it before anything catastophic. I tried a couple times to tell her, but each time was when she started to get short. I'm not sure how to bring it up. I don't want it to be a production. I just feeling like I'm lying to her alot. I'm trying to have a better relationship.  Oh, we (Elaine and I) went shopping on Sat. Sue has been very persistant on the fact that I am NOT to wear clothes that are too big for me. So I went to get some work clothes. I even spent 3 hours today going through my closet and pulling out stuff to give away. Also, since I've lost weight I can fit into stuff I haven't worn in years. In fact today I got into a pair of pants I haven't warn since October 16, 1997. I know the date cause that's when I (um....never mind). Anyway, I'm psyched they fit, but remember that one trend of pajama pants? Ya....I don't think I can pull it off anymore. Maybe I'll use them as actual pajama pants. One thing I really, really want is a pink frame that says "Girlie Girl" on it to put my biohazzard pic in. I couldn't find one so I got a pink one with rindstones. Yeahee!!    urlLink    Biohazzard  urlLink      I also found I little nightie set that said "Sugar and Spice" after that I tried really hard to find a "I love Sugar" or "I want Sugar", but no luck. :( I did find a lingerie store called "pussycats". How cool is that? Didn't buy anything though. Almost, but it was mostly fantacy though. I can get away with wearning nighties around my room, but I'm not sure about the chain link dress.  Ok, time for bed. I feel like I'm forgetting some stuff, but I can't figure out what it is. Hey, I know these posts are long, but they'll get better. My therapist is back in town!!!! I'll finally have somewhere else to rant about my shit. I'm hoing she'll be able to figure my shit out. Yeaheeee for therapy!! (Damn it Red, why did you get me to using Yeahee so much?)
