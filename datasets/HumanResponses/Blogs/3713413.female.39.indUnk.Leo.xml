      Caught another outdoor show at the Farmers Market last Friday.  This one featured local legends Ipso Facto, The Honeydogs, and Iffy.  It was a lovely night and the music was great.  Unfortunately, I missed most of the Ipso Facto set, but from what I heard those guys are still sounding great.   The Honeydogs were absolutely on fire.  I don't think I've ever seen a more energetic set from them.  Peter Anderson did double duty on drums that night as he has been playing for The Honeydogs while Noah Levy is on tour with some band the kids all seem to adore.  Forgive me for not remembering the name.  Peter is easily the best drummer in this town and one of the nicest people to boot.  He also plays for a few other bands, including Kraig Jarret Johnson & The Program, Mark Mallman, and Sideways.  Lots of tunes from the latest Honeydogs release, 10,000 Years (2003) and the self-released Island of Misfits (2001)as well as a Todd Rundgren cover sung by guitarist Brian Halverson.  The band was also joined onstage by one of the members of Ipso Facto for a few songs, and Andrea, who has a beautiful voice and is a member of Adam Levy's other band, Hookers and Blow.  She was amazing on a cover of T Rex's 20th Century Boy, which is becoming a Honeydogs staple these days.   Next up was Iffy and their energetic set really has me looking forward to a new release from them.  About half of the set was fairly new material to me and it sounded great. Kirk Johnson is amazing to watch, but so is the rest of the band.  I've never seen anyone put as much into a show as Iffy does.  The backdrop of the downtown skyline added to the idyllic scene.  Iffy is a long way from being Run Westy Run, but having most of the same personnel doesn't hurt, as we all know those were some legendary shows. Tom Merkl looks like he is having the time of his life up there playing bass; Kirk is a dancing maniac; Blake Hurlbert and Peter Anderson keep the rhythm going; and Kraig Johnson lays down a smooth guitar line and adds backing vocals.  The combination is infectious.  I wouldn't miss another Iffy show if I were you.  Pic are here:  urlLink click here

      In case you hadn't heard about it, there's a nice series of free concerts going on outdoors this summer.  Thursday night I attended the second of eight shows put on at the Mill City Museum in Minneapolis.  The show featured Adam Levy, lead singer of The Honeydogs, local favorites for at least tje last ten years. I've been hearing and seeing Adam a bit longer than that, since I remember him and his brother Noah playing with Chris Lynch in a little band called The Picadors.  The show started around 6 p.m. and consisted of Adam and his Gibson acoustic.  Lots of Levy friends and family were in attendance, as well as die-hard fans and curious onlookers.  The group of little girls up front provided dancing and enthusiasm, but proved a bit too distracting for Adam by the end of the show.  	Adam performed two short sets with a nice mix of old and new songs.  He told some great stories to explain the songs, and even revealed that he's been secretly working on a children's album before performing on of the songs he hopes to put on it called Olives, Olives.  The Ruin Courtyard was a perfect backdrop for  Were The Heavens Standing Blindly?, Adam's song about the Holocaust, from the 2003  Honeydogs album, 10, 000 Years.  We were treated with songs from all five Honeydogs cds, including one written for a movie soundtrack.  The sets were a bit short-12 songs in the first half, and  7 in the second half-with the whole thing wrapping up at about 7:40 p.m.  Despite that, it was still a nice treat to hear Honeydogs songs with a slightly different  treatment.  Best of all, it was free!  If you want to see Adam with the whole band, there will be a show at the Minneapolis Farmer's Market on Friday, June 25th.  Here's the setlist for Adam's show: 1st Set: 1. Test Tube Kid (10, 000 Years, 2003) 2. Hearts & Heads (Here's Luck, 2000) 3. Mainline (Seen A Ghost, 1997) 4. Sour Grapes (Here's Luck) 5. Wilson Boulevard (Here's Luck) 6. Rosie Flores Came To Town (Island of Misfits, 2001) 7. For The Tears (Here's Luck) 8. Panacea (Island of Misfits) 9. Cherub (Seen a Ghost) 10. Were The Heavens Standing Blindly? (10, 000 Years) 11. Miriam (Everything, I Bet You, 1996) 12. Olives, Olives  2nd Set: 13. Rumor Has It (Seen A Ghost) 14. Those Things Are Hers (Seen A Ghost) 15. Chasing the Sun (?) 16. Sans Sucre (Seen A Ghost) 17. Freakshow (Here's Luck) 18. 10, 000 Years (10, 000 Years) 19. Bad Day, Good Night (Everything, I Bet You)  Other upcoming shows at the Ruin Courtyard include Big Ditch Road on July 15, Kraig Jarret Johnson on August 5, and Mark Mallman on August 19.

      What a great show!  I will try and write more details later (and get the pictures up) but for now suffice it to say that these guys are one of the best bands I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.  It was a small lineup compared to the folks that have played on their records, but the sound was great, the band seemed like the nicest bunch of guys you could ever know, and those songs just kill me.   We got to hear most of last year's album, Post To Wire, in the live setting.  I believe all but the title track and Through were played.  This album is one of two that I wish I had bought last year so I could have put it in my top ten for the year (Skating Club's Bug and Flowers is the other one).  The minute I heard it I was in love with all of the songs.  After waiting nearly five years to hear this band again, I'm so glad they came back.  I hope they don't wait another five years to return.    urlLink click here

      I don't know where all you Slobberbone fans were on June 11th & 14th, but you should have been seeing Brent Best, the lead singer of Slobberbone, at the 400.  I've got all kind of friends from Texas who have been telling me for the past couple years about these amazing solo shows from Brent.  I have been insanely jealous, so you can imagine how thrilled I was to see that Brent was actually going to play a couple of shows here.    Brent's been writing some new stuff and he showcased a few songs here.  I don't know whether they'll show up on a new Slobberbone album or if they will be included on a Brent solo album.  I would be thrilled either way.  The new song Robert Cole would be beautiful no matter where we see it, as long as it does get released because it's a  lovely song about a boy's 9th birthday which coincides with the death of his father.   Seeing an acoustic treatment of those rockin' S'bone numbers was also an especially nice treat.  You wouldn't think an acoustic guitar would make Pinball Song rock as much as the banjo, electric, bass and drums, but it definitely did.    Those of you who talked near the stage throughout Brent's entire opening set for The Handsome Family, and those of you who didn't show up at the 400 either night, missed a rare and wonderful opportunity.  Again, thank god for the Sullivan brothers for having great taste in music.  Pics from both of Brent's shows are here:   urlLink click here    urlLink click here

      I guess I'm going to try and put some show reviews up here while David is away doing his usual summer festival thing in Europe.  Tonight I'm seeing Richmond Fontaine at the 400 Bar.  I'm so very excited to see this band again.  They are fantastic!  Karla

       urlLink click here   In yet another preview of Rock for Democracy, spoutpress.com put on it's 2nd annual Cover Song Contest.  This was an unusual type of show in that audience participation was essential to it's success.  We got to vote on our favorites, although I definitely disagreed with the rest of the audience on my favorite cover.  Some of the best covers were done later in the night with Ol Yeller, who played a full set after the comtest awards were given out.  Elton's Benny & The Jets and Blue Oyster Cults' Burning For You were real highlights.  Kurt Allis & Ben Durrant of Unguided Missile opened the show with a wonderful rendition of Stand By Your Man.  Louise Rocks of Sherman Electric followed with Brand New Key.  Devon Gray of Heiruspecs covered Stevie Wonder.  Bob Frey covered Slaid Cleaves' Broke Down, one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite Texas songwriters.  I was pretty unimpressed by Amy Jennings & Matty Schindler covering Total Eclipse of the Heart, but I have to applaud her for not picking up her keyboard and running off the stage.  The audience picked her as their winner, though I cannot fathom why.  The Larpenteurs made another appearance this year with another cover of a Carpenters song.  This time it was For All We Know.  Matty Schindler covered Willie Nelson.  Work of Saws pulled out two suprising numbers: The theme from Land of the Lost morphing into the Juicy Fruit jingle.  Marlee Macleod closed the first set with her cover of Chevy Van.  She won runner up for her efforts, resulting in someone's old bowling trophy I think.  The 2nd set of performers began with last years favorites Best Friend Forever covering Prince's Dirty Mind complete with both girls wearing homemade Prince masks. Next up were Rob Skoro on Paul McCartney's Heart of the Country and Barbara Jean & Leah of Grace Darling covering Lucinda William's Blue.  Both were very nice efforts.  Next up were winner Mike Lewis and his stand-up bass player from Midwestern Standard Time doing Hey Ya.  I might have liked it better if I weren't already so sick of hearing everybody else covering this song, but it was original on sax.  Laila Vera covered Fever with a little help from the audience on syncopation and her flute.  Raven covered The Zombies' I Love You.  Bird Problem was up next with Dramarama's Anything, Anything (I'll Give You).  Terry Eason was supposed to be the final performer (there were Terry Eason updates throughout the night as he was playing a gig elsewhere) and he did a fine job on Liz Phair's Help Me Mary.  Ryan Smith from The Melismatics was the final contestant with Bob Mould's Explode and Makeup.  It was my audience pick anyway. Celebrity judges Matt Wilson, Lori Barbero, and Jessy Greene were hard at work tabulating the results and the awards were given as I've already mentioned.  It was one of the funner nights I've spent at a show.  The only drawbacks were the noisy air conditioners and the staff who couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it.

       urlLink click here   I would be remiss if I failed to mention this show, and I'm already a couple weeks behind as it is.  We've been pretty lucky this summer, considering that this is usually a slow time in town.  Aside from all the crap going on with First Avenue, we've still managed to have some pretty good stuff going on in the Twin Towns. I almost missed the show because we took a nap about 9 pm and woke up at 11:30 pm.  We managed to get on the road and the band was already playing, but I don't think we missed much.  I feel kind of bad about missing Paul Pirner's band Mosquito Ranch, but we did get to see them open for The Program at the Red Carpet in St. Cloud a few months back. My friend Ben had this to say about the show: "...the Turf Club set later that night was hotter than hell. The Program was clearly enjoying themselves onstage. A much,  much better show than the performance at the Turf back in late February...and also one of the best Program shows I've seen to date. Dan Murphy jumped onstage for "Spooky", and after a jam in the middle, Kraig asked, "when did we turn into a motherfuckin' jam band?!!!" Then he sang an improvised verse about the big show on July 18th, and  reminded everyone, "Don't be late!" Then, Marc Perlman got up for "Freight Train" to bring the evening to a close..." The usual members of the band were there: Kraig Johnson, David Poe, Peter Anderson, Jim Boquist, and Ed Ackerson.  It's really an all-star band and if you haven't heard about any of these guys before, you've been living under a rock or something.  Kraig's been a member of The Jayhawks, Run Westy Run, Dim Sum, and The O Jeez and is currently in Iffy, Sideways, and Golden Smog as well as leading The Program.  David Poe is a solo artist out of NYC and he met Kraig when he was touring The Program with The Jayhawks and helped Kraig get some of his songs down on paper.  Peter Anderson is our local drummer who is in just about every band in town these days.  Besides The Program, Peter also plays regularly with Iffy, Sideways, Mark Mallman, Astronaut Wife, Polara, as well as currently subbing for Noah Levy in The Honeydogs.  I also spottd him twirling his sticks for The Olympic Hopefuls last Friday at Peavey Plaza.  Jim Boquist is a former member of Son Volt, whose future is still uncertain from what I hear.  They have a song on the upcoming Alejandro Escovedo tribute disc Por Vida.  Jim also appears on Gillian Welch's Soul Journey, Golden Smog's Weird Tales, and Joe Henry's Fireman's Wedding.  He and his brother Dave play an occasional show together in Minneapolis as well.  Ed Ackerson is the guru of local label Susstones and has led the band Polara for several years.  He recently began Sideways, an instrumental band with Kraig Johnson, Tim Oesau, and blake Hurlbert.  Before starting Polara, Ed also was in The 27 Various and The Dig. Like Ben said, The Program was hotter than hell.  Among the usual songs, they also covered Keith Richard's How I Wish, and Golden Smog's If I Only Had a Car.  Kraig wrote that one, so I don't know if it qualifies as a cover, but there you go.  You gotta get with The Program!

      Adam played a benefit for John Kerry last Thursday night.  He's also a part of the Rock for Democracy which is putting on benefits all over the country right now.  The big show for us in the Twin Cities is at First Avenue this coming Sunday featuring members of Golden Smog, Kraig Jarret Johnson & The Program, The Honeydogs, Jessy Greene, the Flops, and Sideways. Adam's show was put on to promote awareness and involvement in the community, especially among the young professionals.  He played a nice one-hour set consisting of old and new Honeydogs material and after a request from an audience member for some songs he didn't know, he played The Kinks' Picture Book as a closer. I always enjoy a solo show from a longtime band leader.  Adam writes intelligent, thought-provoking songs and that really comes through in a solo, acoustic setting.  Sometimes it's the first time you actually can hear and understand the lyrics.  We're quite lucky in this town to have Adam available to us.  I'm also glad he's involved himself politically.  Get out there and rock for democracy!   urlLink click here

       urlLink click here    A few words about this little event are in order, I suppose.  An insider friend who seems to know all that goes on in the Susstones camp informed me that Ed Ackerson has been hanging out and spinning records at the Bryant Lake Bowl on Tuesday nights.  Last week there was a special show on the schedule featuring Susstones acts The Mood Swings, The Melismatics, Sideways, and special guest from NYC, David Poe.  It was a very nice showcase of these up and coming bands and I was privileged to be among the attendees.  I always enjoy seeing a show in the intimate setting of the BLB.  This one wasn't even full to the 70 or so person capacity.  If you haven't seen a show here yet, I highly recommend it.  The sound is spectacular and you can get food and drink in the theater as well.  Too bad about the no smoking rule, but I know I ought to quit anyway.  First up were The Mood Swings with special guest bass player Dan Boen.  I'm not sure if Dan is a permanent addition to the lineup or not, but I have a feeling he is, what with Melismatics bassist Mark Wade getting a little busy these days.  The Mood Swings gals really rock out and their set was very enjoyable.  I've seen the band at least three times and they have a very catchy pop sound as well as intelligent lyrics going for them.  Next we got to hear The Melismatics in a whole new way.  Their set was semi-acoustic and sitting down.  Members of the band said afterward that it was really weird for them.  I liked it.  The first time I saw this band was in the Entry a couple years ago and they've been climbing to the top of the pop charts ever since.  The sit-down set was different, but it was a nice change and fit nicely with the BLB atmosphere.  I always feel that the ture test of a good band is whether they can pull off their stuff in an acoustic setting to see if the songs hold equal weight and I wasn't disappointed.  David Poe played a song of his own after this and then stuck around and played one of his numbers with Sideways, Ed Ackerson's latest project.  I understand David is still under contract with another label, so I don't know how much mention I should make of his presence.  Suffice it to say that he didn't get much time on the mic, but he made pretty good use of the time he had.  I understand David has a new album coming out later this year, so check his website for details.  The final act of the evening was Sideways.  I believe this was only the third ever performance of this band featuring Ed Ackerson, Kraig Johnson, Blake Hurlbert, Tim Oesau, and Peter Anderson.  It's a jazzy, guitar & keyboard-based sound.  While not normally a sound I would be drawn to, there is so much damn talent in this band, it's pretty hard not to listen.  I believe most of the songs have been written by Ed, but last week featured a new song written by Kraig.  They have put out one album on Susstones called Oblivion and Points Beyond (2003) which is available at the Susstones website.  I hope they will continue making new music, despite the very busy schedules of these very talented musicians, because it is music that is well worth hearing.
