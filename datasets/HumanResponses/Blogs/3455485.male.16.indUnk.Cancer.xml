      OK im pretty much horrified.  I come into my science class today and the teacher is like trying to look all normal but i knew something was up i could smell it, litterally im not kidding you it stunk to high heaven.  I turn around and to my dismay there is a pig fetus on the desk behind me.  I was like eh eh dog eh theres a pig fetus on this bench thinger but no one seemed to care untill an immigrant noticed it. So i did what any law abiding citizen would do and i was like hey pig hey pig and then i got the clams which are really icky too and i put them on the table next to them. When i sat down i looked at corey and we were both like nuh uh and then some kid asked some dum question and the teacher was like, im really dumb i love to eat worms, and i was like thats dumb. Then she talked about how she killed rats back in her college days and she was like well what you do so it is   Humane   you give them so much antispectic that they fall asleep and never wake up for a long time, then what you do is you cut their diaphagms. And i was like woah thats not cool because that only makes it so when they wake up they sufficate, you tell me one humane thing about that. Oh yeah i pretty much caught a huge fish and named it william he was really cool till he bit me and i cut his head off.  He was like 18 inches long before i cut his head of and now hes like 15 i mean this is like a friggin huge fish and im gonna eat it whether you like it or not. Hmm i think im gonna go eat, bbl.

      Its pretty much like 1030 or something and i remeber how much pears rule.  First of all they are like sweet, and like second of all they are green and you can eat them, i mean whats better than that? its sweet, its green and you can eat it.  I mean i dont think i could ask for anything more, i think you would have to be a lumberjack or a vietcong to not be able to enjoy a pear. WOAH theres like mud outside, whatever.

      OK so im realllllly crazy so what who cares, put down that chainsaw and listen to me for a second, yah you, you will listen or become one with tropical disastor and we know that you do-s nots wants tos haves thats.  I will tell you something that bothers me riiight now, im not even kidding you.  It starts with Gay and lesbians and it ends with day of silence. My expert opinion says that a day of silence to remeber gays is rediculous and im pissed beyond all recognition.  I think im gonna throw a goose at a small childs farm house and watch the feathers fly, thats the anger i feel.  First of all i can think about ummm approximatley a bagillion things better to be SILENT about for a day to remeber than friggin gays, the alpahbet is pretty much something more important to be silent about, if theres one thing in this world that doesnt get enough credit its the alpahbet.  The friggin alamo is even more important to be silent about i mean i would be silent for earthworms before i would be silent for friggin gays.  I have news for you gay people, youre dumb and no one cares, and the next time you talk like a friggin gay im gonna throw a book case on your arm and be like, oh yah i just bookcased your arm and if you move im gonna throw cheese and that goat.  This is whats i feels today, and if those clams say one more thing i swear i will loose it. Oh yes, something else for the pot of knowledge if you mix cookies with like stuff you get stuff and cookies, and when that 2 years old and you and talcott eat it your stomaches get sick and you get pissed.  Praise Allah!
