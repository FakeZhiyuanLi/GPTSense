      well well well..what a day it has been.. eventful to say the least. i'll start from the beginning. first of all we had the french exam. tres easy.  i sat by maggie AND geoff. lets just say that me and jonny had a little " extra" help. huh huh huh ( french laugh) then, me and robyn serched the school several times looking for jenna, and we actually never found her in the end. and my mom came and picked me robyn and jenny up from school and brought us home. then we decided to meet up at subway for a little sindig. we got our subway and went back to jennys to eat on her deck as it gets tres hot on hot day's.  on the way to her house however, we met up with our good friends kathryn and kim.. but they couldnt join us(sadly)becuase they had to stuady(there my heros). so it was off to jenny's, and we ended up on her deck with SPF 30, and some subway. we finished that and then i came up wih tha brilliant idea to run around in circles with baseball bats( i saw it on AFV).. well let me tell you, that was an expirence to say the least. then we decided to pop up to good ol' vanier. turns out it was still lunch time so we took out post on the saidewalk across the school for 10 mins. then we the coast was clear we went to the school but got turned down by a mean/good for nothing teacher. so then we reatred to the play ground were we played grounders ! after getting bored of that we went BACK to jenny's and then played square ball and then some tennis. after all was said and done we went back into jenny's and watched oprah, whatta girl.  i ended up going home at 3:30, 20 mins after my schedualed time. i studied , and now im here.. studying again with my dear friend rob.   what a day..  probably sounds boring to you.. but it was full of excitment.  read robyn's blog for some more information on this special day  -erin           leave a comment god damnit.  p.s. turns out i got still got burnt with SPF 30 and all.. shesh
