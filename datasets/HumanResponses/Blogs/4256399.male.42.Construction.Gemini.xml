      All too often, on live projects comments are made like"This job is going "belly-up".....the Planner is useless, get me another one!"  Simple truth is, everyone on site thinks the only person who needs to plan is the planner. Infact everyone on site needs to plan & they all need to co-ordinate their own plans with each other.  The best people to plan the work, are the people doing the work. The most difficult thing to achieve on site is full communication between all parties.  For any plan to work, everyone involved must know what is required of them & by when. They must also know how &amp; to what extent they effect others if they don't achieve. All too often a task is commenced without having all the resources that are required to finish it in place, sometimes items are not even ordered!  Here are just a few reasons why tasks are not completed on time;   Insufficient Materials Available.  Insufficient Labour Resource.  Insufficient or Breakdown of Plant.  Lack of Design Information.  Materials Delivered Wrongly or Orded Wrongly.  Late Change of Design or Client Requirements.  Weather.  Tasks Programmed Incorrectly.   The list is endless. In my experience the last reason on the above list is very rare, all of the others happen very frequently & all are avoidable. To avoid all of the above &amp; the subsequent delays to the Project, all of the Construction Team must play their part in the planning process. Responsibility for planning is not something that can be devolved to one person, the Whole Team must take equal responsibility.  So why have Planners? Currently, someone needs to collate the information from the Whole Team & process the information, someone also needs to "drive" the planning tools. In the future, maybe we don't need Planners, maybe we will all have the compentency to plan &amp; we may all have access to tools that allow full & real-time communication between all parties involved &amp; the Programme becomes a "live document" that we all have access to, from the designers to the foremen?  There is no "maybe", these systems do exist, the tools do exist, we just have bad habits & an unwillingness to change the way we do things. By the time individuals are in a position within the Industry to change things, they have usually had 20+ years of "bad habits" &amp; an acceptance of "waste". There is a need for Planners, but not wrapped up in detail & in knots. Planners are required to ensure that the fundamental planning requirements are covered by plans &amp; that the true objectives are being met. Sometimes we even forget the true objectives, we forget why we are actually doing something. We lose sight of the GOAL.
