      Back home after a fabulous weekend away with my girlfriend, Angie... I ache in places I didn't know I had! ;)  On Friday I didn't leave work until 4am on Saturday morning. One of the programs that was meant to take an hour to run (at the most) ended up taking seven and a half hours! Had to wait for it to finish... well, what can you do. Got home at around 5am and saw the sun rise on the way. It was very romantic, which put me in a nice frame of mind for the weekend. Plus a late night meant I'd be able to stay awake later on Saturday!  The hotel was great; a lovely room, and a shower that had so much pressure you could use it to strip paint! Makes a change from what you usually get in hotels. Had planned to go for a drink when Angie arrived... but that all went out the window when she appeared. As I'm a gentleman, that's all I'm prepared to say; if you want juicy stuff, go browse for porn! lol  We had such a good time... it's great being in love. :D  Steve ;)

      Ahhh... just booked for my first weekend away with the girlfriend... can't wait! We're going away somewhere so we can be together with no distractions, just me and her, spending lots of time in each other's company. I'm going to try my best to make it a wonderfully romantic weekend. I hope I can, because I love her so much.   Steve ;)

      Ok, I thought I'd put a few of my favourite links and stuff on here for you all to check out.   Acme.com  This site has a lot of cool stuff including a car number plate maker, and a love hearts maker (those little sweets?) and you can customise the messages on them. Use them as signatures in forums, etc. My personal favourite is the  Dymo Tape labelmaker .   Mousebreaker.com  and  Miniclip.com  Two sites packed with great Flash games to play, and totally free too. I love the  Table Tennis  game, even though it's pretty tough!   DTI Keeper  I always had a problem when I resized my PC screen for one reason or another, and when installing new drivers, because it invariably screwed up the layout of all my icons on the desktop. But I discovered this fantastic little shareware item, made by  DragonOne Software . This nifty little application memorises desktop layouts for you and saves them, so you can restore them to where they were quickly and easily. I've found it to be invaluable.   Enjoy!  Steve ;)

      Yep, it's Monday again... well, at least I'm working from home today, and don't have to face the traffic. But month end is almost here, which means long hours in the office :-(  Had a pretty good weekend though. Spent most of it either on the phone or on MSN to my girlfriend... she continues to amaze me with the way she makes me feel. It's soooo good, can't wait for us to be together again.  Arrrgh just remembered a job I have to do this afternoon, preparing reports for upload to the intranet... possibly the single worst part of my job. Long process on a system which continually crashes... who bought this shite software anyway? Oh yes, that's right... the "bosses" (who don't have to use it, and don't have to sit in the office until 4am each month like we do, trying to close all the subsystems)  Ah well. Pay day tomorrow :-D  Steve ;)

      Wow! What a race! Fantastic stuff, at last we see some proper F1 for the first time this season!  This was always gonna be an incident packed race. The first start was aborted after the parade lap, when Olivier Panis stalled his Toyota on the grid (out of position). On the second parade lap, he did it again, and was pushed into the pit lane in time so that the race could begin.  The lights went out, and the Renaults made perfect starts, with Fernando Alonso passing Jenson Button into Ste Devote, but the fastest start was made by Button's teammate Takuma Sato... he stormed into 4th place, nudging front wheels with Michael Schumacher in the process. But all was not well with Sato's BAR... you could see on the first couple of laps, there were wisps of smoke coming from the Honda engine... was it just an overfilled oil tank? or something more serious?  The answer came before too long. With a queue of cars behind him heading into Tabac, the BAR Honda let go in spectacular fashion, churning out thick white smoke. Sato got the car off the racing line, and Kimi Raikkonen shot past him. But this area of the track was now enveloped in smoke, and visibility was zero... and the inevitable happened. Giancarlo Fisichella came flying round at about 90mph straight into the back of David Coulthard. The Sauber flipped over, narrowly missing a couple of marshals, and Coulthard lost his rear wing, ending his race. Fisichella was unhurt, thankfully.  All this meant that the safety car was brought out, bunching up the field. After five laps the racing resumed... the Renaults maintained their positions, keeping Button, Raikkonen and Michael Schumacher behind them. Juan Pablo Montoya managed to steal 6th from Rubens Barrichello at the restart.  At the first round of pitstops, Button was first in, followed by the two Renaults and the McLaren. Michael Schumacher now had a clear track in front of him, and he used it to good effect, putting in some stunning laps, before stopping a few laps later. This put him up to thrid, right behind the two Renaults.  But Alonso decided to try and lap Ralf Schumacher on the outside line through the tunnel... a bad move, which saw him understeer into the barrier, wrecking his car and his chance of a win. The safety car was brought out once more while the debris was cleared. Trulli and Button immediately pitted to take advantage, but Michael Schumacher was not so lucky; he was caught behind the safety car and couldn't make a pitstop without compromising his position. This was a major blow to his chances of a win.  Then a bizarre incident ended his chances completely... while still under the safety car, they came into the tunnel. Michael accelerated and them braked hard, presumably to warm up his brakes - Montoya, who was behind him and seemed to be going way too fast, had to brake and swerve right to avoid hitting him. He came alongside, and nudged Michael, who slid into a barrier, losing his nosecone and his left front wheel.   So, who was going to win? Only Trulli and Button looked like they had any chance, and the last 15 laps or so were fascinating... Button was 8 seconds behind, but closing, and was right on Trulli's rear wing on the last lap. But Trulli had driven a masterful race, and wasn't about to make a mistake. He coolly cruised to victory in Monaco, the first Italian to do so in 22 years. It was also his first Grand Prix win, and even though Michael Schumacher had retired from the race, this result was not in doubt, as Trulli had maintained the upper hand from lap 1.   Button was second, and Rubens Barrichello, who had a rear suspension problem on his car, limped home in a distant 3rd place, ahead of Montoya's Williams, Felipe Massa's Sauber, and Cristiano Da Matta's Toyota. Seventh place, and two valuable points for Jordan, went to Nick Heidfeld, and the final point for 8th place when to Olivier Panis in the other Toyota.  Congratulations to Renault and Jarno Trulli on a brilliant weekend. All in all, a fantastic race!  Steve ;)

      Quite looking forward to this race... with Michael off the front row, and two fast-starting Renaults ahead of him, it could be an end to his dominance this season. I know my girlfriend will kill me for saying this, but I hope he does badly... ;)  FA Cup yesterday didn't go too well... 3-0 to Man United in the end. Felt sorry for Millwall, the result didn't really reflect how well they played. And one of the goals was offside. C'est la vie.  My web browsing continues... check out  http://www.themakeupgallery.info/  - this site is great, you can see the amazing transformations people go through to play parts on TV and in movies. Fascinating stuff.  Steve ;)

      Woke up this morning just as the phone rang... it was my girlfriend. I can't think of a nicer way to wake up... oh no, hold on, I can... but she'd be involved in that, too ;-)  F1 qualifying has just finished, Michael is 4th on the grid... the two Renaults and Jenson's BAR are ahead of him. I suspect that Jenson is carrying more fuel as well, as he was quite slow in sector 2. Maybe Michael won't beat Mansell's record by winning the first six races after all... fingers crossed.  20 mins to go until the FA Cup Final between Millwall and Man United. I have to support Millwall, for a couple of reasons... everyone hates Man United, and Millwall are the underdogs... and as a Chelsea fan, I would love to see Dennis Wise raising the trophy. And Alex Feguson looking miserable... always good! :-D  Come on Millwall!!  Steve ;)

      Into gaming? You might wanna check out  Hamsterserver.com , we're a gaming group and we have a server that runs various online games. We're all hamsters. Get on the forums and give us a shout... we don't bite :-)  It's Friday at last... It's great working from home. I don't have to face the usual 45 mile drive back from Gatwick (and of course on a Friday it's always worse, as the roads I take to get home are the same ones everyone uses to head for France...)  Still not sure what to do this weekend. Might nip to the Vauxhall garage in the morning and get a new external air temperature sensor for my Cavalier... it's been showing the temperature as "--.--" ever since I got the car. It would be nice to know what the real temperature is!  I just read back what I typed... GOD how boring! I really must get a life...  Steve ;)

      Yep, I've been bitten. I've got the lurrrve bug! :-)  There's a girl who I've known for a couple of years now, and recently it's become more than just friendship... she's absolutely gorgeous, and I think the world of her. She's so beautiful and sexy, and she affects me in ways that I've never felt before... it's just incredible!  She knows exactly how I feel... and she has strong feelings for me too. We've been out on dates a couple of times, and it's gone  really  well. But for various reasons the situation is a little complex, so we need to take things slowly.   But at the moment, I'm about as happy in my life as I've ever been.  Steve ;)

      Ok, I seem to have set things up properly now... didn't take too long. It's a breeze! if only everything in life was this simple... *sigh*  Aaaanyway... my plans for the weekend? Well, none really. Unless someone lovely calls and says she needs to see me! ;-)  The F1 race at Monaco is on, but I expect it to be boring. This season seems to be a bit lacking, and Michael Schumacher seems to be running away with the title. In fact, bookmakers Paddy Power have paid out already to people who bet on MS to win the title this year! It's mad. Come on Bernie, get the sport sorted so it's worth watching again...   God, this sounds all so pessimistic! aaargh! Time for some good news. :-)  My flat in Aberdeen is under offer! At last. So, providing the valuation comes up to the £43k offered, it'll be sold. I can't see it coming in below that amount. Fingers crossed... should free up a sizeable chunk of my income that I've been paying out on it the last few months!  That's it for today. Tune in later for more info! Will something exciting happen? Is the world gonna explode? Probably not. But tune in anyway... lol  Steve ;)
