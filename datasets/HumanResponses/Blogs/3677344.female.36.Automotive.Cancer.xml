      Thank you to my friends and family for being an unbelievable, dependable, source of support.  Thank you for allowing me to take as liitle or as much of all that you offer as I need or can cope with, often without asking and mostly without saying "Thank you" in the end.  Thank you for giving me the space I needed to spread my wings and find my strength.  Thank you for being the invisible, yet dependable safety net in case I fell.  Thank you for celebrating my victories with me no matter how monumental or seemingly insignificant.  I truly believe that every victory won, no matter how small is never inconsequential.  Thank you for drying all my tears, no matter how silly or serious they were. Thank you for not asking questions, just accepting my many moods.  Thank you for offering all that you could, for giving mostly of yourselves.  Thank you for your support, encouragement, your cheerleading, your acceptance and your guidence.  Thank you for teaching me that I have worth, I matter, I am beautiful inside and out, and that my past has made me who I am today, but holding on to it was no longer necessary.  Thank you for loving me in the only way you knew how.  Thank you for being there and being someone I could always depend on.  Thank you for holding my hand when I needed added strength.  Even if you could not be there physically, I knew that you were there in spirt, in my heart and in my head.  Thank you for being the little voice in my head, saying "Don't give up, this too shall pass."  Thank you for all the big things and the little things that you all have done and given me in the past 6 months.  Without you, I would not know my strength, my emotional strength.  Thank you for all that you do and all that you are to me.  I love you all. ~B

      In the power of forgivness People only have as much power in your life as you chose to give them Tomorrow is another day Kisses are not contracts, and presents are not promises Company is not security I am enough as I am Nobody completes me, I am whole on my own I can accept 'nothing more' but will settle for nothing less. In the power of the word NO A hug from your children can have incredible healing powers. No always means No, and it's never too late to say No You happiness is your responsibility Love is a choice you make, not a place you fall Marriage takes work One partner can not love enough for both Marriage will only work with two participants
