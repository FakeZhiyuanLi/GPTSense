          Raian. April 2003.  -------  His hands are tense, and his bony fingers grip another grieving pen.  I woke up bathing on his stares, perusing onto every line and flaw of my body. I wonder what time he woke up. I wonder if he ever slept at all. His notebook is open to a third on his lap. Vineyards of his ramblings. He feels the down of the hairs of my feet with the back of his palm, greeting me with his smile. He sits on the edge of the bed, and he seems far. I want his smiles nearer. This morning though is enough for forever. His hair falls to conceal his face, which made him revert to his writing. Some words just wouldn’t wait. Even I couldn’t sober him up from them.  I stealthily sit up to lie nearer. I try to survey his weather. I clip a portion of his hair behind his ear. The sun is on his skin, but the earth feeds him with words. He is a navigable ocean. I ask myself if I have explored enough.  Do I even try, when he has his own measures, his own maps?   And he is beautiful. His perfect imperfections. His frailty, clad with the hunger to create with bare hands. I want to hug him, longer than I must, closer than I should, warmer than I could.  He catches me staring. My thoughts embarrass me, suddenly feeling too transparent about them. I feel my ears warm flushing from my big grin. I hide, with the afterimage of his face, eyes in awe of my madness.   I lay my head on the pillow before him, trying to find a trace of longing in his eyes. I feel needed, wanting to offer what is left of me. Mingle with his fiery blood. Tangle with the revelry of his lexicon. Drink on the senses of his creations.   But then… a daze. Is he all right?  I care. But I wish I know now if I have cared enough. Because to care for him means to listen to his silence, to read a twitch on his face, to sway with the quiet vertigo from stubborn muses. The many languages of his hand upon my nape. I can say I have grown close with the nebulous concentration of his being. I know him well, as much as I am akin with the sea. I come undone with the dilemma between the yardstick of his compassion, and mine. For he never asked for more of me. Insecure, I translate it as my inadequacy, so I strive to be more. The ordeal is that all these are not read from mere feelings.   But not yet a tragedy.  And love. Love and the literati. That entity he considers to be still unnamed, undefined, accursed beyond any mathematical equation. The voldemort that still haunts him at twenty-three. And from these ponderings he lured me into starting from scratch- quelling my preconceived notions of love, dulling away the boyhood wanderings I held on to.   He exhausts me of words and deciphers my every move, but never obtrusively. He always has a minute for everything, I’m amazed at how time ticks slowly, that I resent it. I long for more than just kisses in our time. I wish I could tell him that I could say more to him with my body, my existence, with my own language. He does listen to me intently. But I ache for him to listen to me from this space. My own. I wonder if that obvious contentment is real. Oh yeah, small steps, he says. Maybe I should learn too. Or maybe I should tell him everything now…  What I need of him. What I want for myself.  Or maybe these were never meant for reality. I wonder if I have traveled long to come home to surreal moments with him. Or was I really expecting romance, passion, and sexual innuendos?  I reclaimed my dreams, drawn from a craving for his smiles. And the many places I fantasize about, where I will be with him, inside him. I dreamt of desire, killing me, languishing with me until his memory is quelled to dust. I woke up then panting, ravenous for flesh, crying for a typical life, an ordinary breakfast. But then I knew also that I would be insatiable.  I’ve changed. I know.  I couldn’t leave him sobbing inside this way. I need to see him without his armor. Soon. I know though that I couldn’t do the same thing for him.  And from this day nothing would ever lull me to sleep.  I still have the baggage of his books in my mind, letters printing mildly, sometimes stinging my senses, purging. Mostly numbing me, oblivious of time, of wrong, of right, of place.  This is my death. He haunts me. And I let him.

      Big guy,  Here's something i wrote last year. A day of the holy week. My critics say it's juvenile, amateurish. Here it is anyway. It goes to say also that i had my fill.   The Yesterday.  I try to remember.  When My eyes roved, they drank the scene, tasted the air, pulsated for my heart, heard for me the faintest of sounds, throbbed for the pangs of firsts. The colors and the muffled fires and ashen faces. Mine. His. Theirs.   Yesterday.         The ramifications. Aftermath.  I had to be made new too.   ---------- Bjorn. April 2003.  He parted my hair away from half my face, to clip them behind my ears.  Unaware.  I scribble notes idly on my guilt- tormented notebook, unbeknownst that he drinks of this sight. Before me, he lays on his side, leaning on his left elbow, unabashedly running his fingers on his smooth chest. He rejoins with his pensive mood as he finds a scar. Soon enough he snaps out of it. I caught his stares, and then he grins and blushes, and hides his quiet smiles under the pillow where my notebook lays.  Suddenly he was a boy, cherishing the first pony ride. Or at eighteen, with the pride for his copious, enigmatic photographs. Or simply recalling the morning of the flight of a thousand cranes.  I feed on his innocence and wallow with the many questions that precede the moment. I know he waits for my words, or maybe just a little move, to reciprocate currents of this unspoken. I know I would have laughed. Surely I will be groping for words if he asks why I did. And that would kill it. I manage to lift half a smile. Our eyes lock. And, as if a symphony with a final slur, our smiles fade, our eyes blur. Then he concerns himself of the bags under my eyes.  “You should sleep some more.” “You wouldn’t let me.” “Ah, that’s no fair. I barely spend a night a week here.” “You pity no square inch of my flesh, and this home. Your handprints are all over…what do you suppose I’d make of them?” “Your words are yours. Do I feel sorry for shedding some of mine here?” “You mean…most…?” “You read me like a music piece.” “I inscribe you like the sea.” “The ebb. The tide. The sea foam.” “The sight. The sound.” “The smell? The scorching wind on your skin?”  I look away. He squats behind me, rests his head on my shoulder.  “You wouldn’t want these sensations all at once.” “They might be dulling. But I do want to touch you.” “And I want to be…” “There’s still too much to see, to hear, to listen to…” “Not enough…” “Not yet…”  “The time is slow.” “Or maybe I need to resurface.” “You’re clear as day.” “Or maybe you should…I dream of you.” “You don’t dream…” “I do now.”   “I don’t deserve your tears.” “I’m not crying.” “Yes, you are.”  Inside, I cry rains.  “You say moving on is not a reflex.” “I’m by the well of my comforts.” “I want to see you…”  “Sleep easy, man…”  Then my death reeked.  He knew, though, that he would soon leave. I wrestled with my thoughts, with the reassurances that he was meant to stay.  He died. He had it coming.  But what of this now?  I died first.

      I didn’t dream of you today...  Why didn’t you?  I’m not sure...why do people dream..? why won’t they..? it’s like...baby turtles crashing into sea because they just have to..  Maybe because in our dreams we can hold on to forever, have greater things. Like baby turtles turning into the sea in search of greater adventures...  Ah, you don’t have to go all Disney about it...it’s their reflex, big guy...we don’t just hit the waves and not know how to surf...  And we will never really know what we’ll dream about...I am not sorry that you did not dream of me...because I know that I will feel sorrow if I’ll forever be in your sleep...  I can wake up...i’m not in a deep sleep...

      Hey asshole. Oh fuck its Dem and G Think fast Hey dickhead. Another Saturday. A second one with Guy. We’re back in this hellhole. I have been here. But not this way. Not with a man like Guy. Red designer perfume tight shirts even tighter jeans techno the buffed the lanky the fuck me’s the fuck off’s. Pretty wainscoting its walls. It’s a phenomenon. Hey now, I could be stoic. But then this is beautiful.  We wormed our way to the bar. Crotches felt. Hold on to the next shoulder arm hip lest you get stuck and look lost uncool. Guy’s hand feels me up What? Oh that Uh-huh. I smile. It redeems me from spacing out. G goes Go ahead Dem look for one. Dem goes Pick anyone Kiss anyone Laughs Make him know how it feels. What the hell. Guy takes it in. There Skaterboi. I go Hey What’s your name? The guy in black goes Randy Holds out his hand awkwardly. I don’t shake. You wanna kiss me? Skaterboi budges Smiles Blushes. I face Guy. He’s pissed, trying to smile. I own that consternation in his eyes. Sometimes he robs me of it. And then I’ve got nothing. I slide behind him Hug him closer Kiss him on the nape Shoulder Hair My hand probing in his shirt I trail my fingers on his abs. He whispers I’m having a hard- on. We stay glued Watch the mosh.  He releases himself. Ah, his friends. You wait here Kisses me fast. Guy comes down the ledge. Talky talk. He glances at me. I look away. Chiseled Shirtless guys gyrate on the staircase pedestals pretending to enjoy the music Basking before perusing eyes. Hot. Yeah. Sad. Too. The lights are doing something to me. Or else I’m drunk. Fuck not this early. I am drunk. The kick shoots right up the back of my head. A hand in my back pocket. I don’t panic. Skaterboi dances beside. He looks at me straight in the eyes. I pierce back. I look away. I shouldn’t go here. Where’s Guy? He emerges. I help him up the ledge. Are you ok? Uh-huh. He guards me like his own. Reassuring alright. Baffling too. My hand wraps his hip taming his dance. Oh. A chat with skaterboi. Guy pulls me nearer his ear He held my hand I talked to him It was nothing. I shout back I saw that alright Ease down there’s nothing to it. He looks away. I look away. I’m not pissed. He is. He has been. He goes Let’s not do this anymore. I wrap myself around him. He turns Watches the scene. We sway with the music. A hand in my back pocket. Skater goes needy. I let him. I don’t look. What? It’s Guy and his many whats. I’m not I shout. I smile. He begs Let’s go to the bar. Randy takes my left hand. Guy takes my right. I trailed my sweaty palm on skater’s face. I didn’t look back. No afterthought.  We share a glass of water Watch each other. I’m drunk. Orange guy fiddles my arm. Fuck off. I move away. Am I high I couldn’t be. Where’s my drink? Fuck I hate beer. I’m heading up washroom. Go ahead. Just stay here ok? I will. I sit on the red niche on the wall. I’m no angel Guy. Not always. I can kill too. This is not my turf. Where I s my turf? Fifteen years was it Guy? How are answers unearthed from this place? Salvage. That’s strong enough a word. But who needs saving Guy? How consumed are you now from wallowing within an idea of a young pervader? So as to leave everything behind. I’m no god. I can be a god. I can be a god too. I hurt now. Fuck these feelings. You say you hurt because I push you away. What part of I love you I think of you You have pervaded my thoughts don’t you understand Guy? Words will never be enough to someone who understands my language. I had this coming. You ask of me to be yours. I relinquish. How do I make you mine? Words. They’re all I have. But then you have them too. And maybe it’s all I ask. If I dare ask for anything. Guys swoon over you The wild thing s in your head. They want the new one Try things they will never fully understand. How many among these guys Guy? Have you said the same things to them when you fucked them? I don’t remember any of the names I’ve heard tonight. There are far more disturbing things. I disturb myself. I write about you Guy. How do you ever listen to my thoughts? How? Fuck my head throbs. Guy plucks himself out of the pretty crew. Hey He smiles. Looks here. Looks there. He focuses on my eyes. I crave because I am his sick puppy. He catches my head with his hands Kisses me Thirsty Undry my mouth. I miss you. I release. I probe his face for my doing. Or undoing. He sighs. I’m back sober.  We join the madding throng. Guy yells on G’s ear. Dem goes on mine I don’t have to tell you Guy’s a great catch. I go You don’t have to affirm it for me. I’m telling you He rubs You’ll need a lot more patience than this. I go I try. I’m still trying. Dem assumes his best friend role. This is a breeze. How’s it going between you two so far? He’s been writing about me. Fuck that didn’t come out good. I’ve got nothing. And I’ve been writing about him. He nods Downs his beer.  Guy grabs my hand. Yuan’s upstairs. What the..? So? I go Hey do I have to go You can’t be serious. You cant introduce me now. He pulls me stubbornly. I get squeezed between every Paolo Jayson Mark I’m palpitating. I make sense of the blurry stairs. I try to tread up straight coolly. Yuan’s leaning on the wall three steps to the landing. Why the fuck would he wanna stand and drink here? Yuan Rai. Rai Yuan. I look away. He pulls on to Guy Touches his face Whispers. Fuck this. I head straight up the landing. I slither my way to the washroom Anchored by every shoulder I see. I froze when I have a view of Guy and Yuan from the mezzanine. Yuan begs Guy wavers. Silence. Pensive. Yuan strokes his face, brings him near. Guy retreats. They’re screaming at each other’s ear. No harsh moves. Guy’s sad. Tormented? I have this pang of urgency to snatch him away from this. He can’t be in this. I’ve got nothing. I feel fingers fondling my right ear. I’ve been blocking the way to the washroom and exit. Washroom. Empty. Lucky. I take a leak. White wall. Just what I need. I fix myself. I walk composed to the sink Wash my face. My face. My fingers meet their reflection. My eyes. Tired. Rai. Why do you cry? Hey You okay? Guy. Yeah. You walked out. I had to. Let’s go back. Okay. Hands up face down. For you. Want. Need. Rai. I follow. Albert James Timmy. Breath Sweat Brush. Blue light calms me. Dem goes Where the fuck is he I’m gonna give it to him. Guy shrugs He wants me back Says he loves me Misses me Wanted to kiss me. I fall silent. Guy snatches me with one hand. I pant. He feels my breathing. Kisses. Warm. Warmer than last. Long. Full. Mine. We should go. Dem insists 5. G seconds. 5 it is. It will be soon. I am you Guy Of a twenty-four year old. My scars reek of regret Absolution My eyes heavy as ramblings of your uninnocence. You are my hidden cesspool. For every Touch Moan Favor Gaze I could Kill Taste Fend off Smile Too. I am stranger. Still. Of this brothel. And I wouldn’t change that. But I wait to be claimed Guy. I beg of you to.

      i have began to do the unthinkable.  one vessel. two entities.  He is ClubGod. He is UrbanMonk. He lives south. He lives north. Both writers. He writes to sleep. He reads to sleep. He's confrontational. He's conversational. He talks to earn. He writes to earn. He is lanky. He is built. Both tops. Both dance like nelly- bottoms. He drinks vodka. He drinks green tea. He smokes. He scents his bath. Both non-cute. Both handsome. Both know their coffee. Both know coffee. Both metrosexuals. Both neruda's kids. Both uncomplicated. Both schizoid. He runs with prada. He runs with nike. Both beachcombers (go figure). He says europe. He says asia. He keeps me awake. He keeps me asleep. He is half-real. He is surreal. Both imperfect. Both perfect. Both filling. Both i crave for. Both i love. Both i don't deserve. Both haunt my thoughts. Both feed on my thoughts. Both feed me with words. Both inspire me. Both wants to keep me. Both i love.  Both i may be bound to lose.  soon.

      You hush me from my tangled handiwork of broken guitars              slurry compositions              schizoid lyrics  Sleep.       You Are.  The seafoam i waited for.  But all i could do was kiss you    and get lost within           the nothingness                  of your desires.  The color of your name found its peace when you realized that indeed  you need one thing of  me--  The music of my name  sang its joy when i heard that heart who could  actually need--         one smile        mine        my purest  i say let its flooding begin.

      It is too big a name like ours      of three letters      of one syllable We don on each of them an aphorism of sort  i languish within  labyrinthine wordplay raining expletives to  build turrets for a name  letters.flair.elate.  You give me a minute  You smile  my compunctions wilt and you wake me to  summer midmornings you become my hushabye loch  you ask  how is home  i say  i still call it mine  four letters. oh,sorry. it's in me.

      My Version. Relationship. Commitment. Attachment. Emotional Stability. Define. Compartmentalize. Fuck the Past. Do the Present.   "...you go ahead with your grandiose, essential discourse on love, life, and maturity."  Safety. Convenience. Selfish. Giving.  "...at the end of this conversation, after coffee...i'm still charmed. i fold. i have my fill...and possibly want more. i want more...i'll have the kiss now, please..."  "you hang easy..."  "who are you kidding...?

      1 message received    &nbsp;  "...It's useless anyway. If you had a million years to do it in, you can't even rub out half the 'fuck you' signs in the world." -the catcher in the rye       Another quaint resto.  The chairs are conscientiously lined, turned over the massive tables. I thought Sicily. I wished for its music but i got reverberating bass from the neighbor bars and clubs. The spotlights are still on, the shadow of the furnitures cast heavy and long on our direction. A narrow alley. Random benches. We chose the farther one, wanting solace. But either way, the sober denizens of the adjacent coffee shop gets a good view of us...i said fuck that...  Intense, he is. Unapologetically, nonchalantly sweet. Insatiable, too.  Lattes at 4 a.m. is downright sinful.    Cold hands. He drums his fingers on my back, to my nape.  I'm at loss for words. Bigger ones. Newer ones. I don't budge.   "i don't intend to deduce all this madness to your past"   "...or else not everytime"  "...and c'mon now, i can't nag, i won't...why would i? whatever for? it's not like..."   "it's not even about love...or apart from it..."   "trust..."   "...and before the pleasing hours...i am your friend first...that's not difficult...it's the easiest thing yet..."  I heard him promise. Please don't promise. It was a promise.  I have a promise.   " i could just have enough for one night..."  I smile.  I speak with it. Unsure if he heard mine.   "i'll stay..."  Warm hand.  Silence.   It's a gift.
