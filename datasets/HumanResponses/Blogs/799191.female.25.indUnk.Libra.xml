      I felt ugly and evil yesterday......actually I felt that everyone was evil and ugly. Its just that the atmosphere here at work is rapidly changing into somthing dark and ugly. I hate conflicts and I would love for this to be over. I was so relived when my work day was over and I was so exhausted when I got home I just cried and slept all day.   Then my brother (wich I havent spoken to for over a year) suddenly decides to buy a computer, and suddenly decides to call my boyfriend to help him buy a computer, and my boyfriend suddenly decides to invite him home to do this!. But it wasnt as ackward as I thought it would be.   My brother is in AA, wich I find amusing, dont get me wrong I support the AA but everyone there is a judgemental God fanatic.

      Hello dear world....or anybody who has stumbled onto my ramblings.   I´m 25 / f / Iceland ...no sorry im 23 years old...silly me. Well anyways I work as a receptionist at a gym and Ive noticed this is the way to spend some time while I work.  I feel poor because:   -I only got 2 panths(both black) and one is ripping apart at the seams.  -I walk everywhere...the bus is to exspensive.  -My breakfast and lunch is a small bag of cheerios, no milk.  -I cant go on vacation to a warmer climate this year.

      Sometimes I feel that everyones out to get me and that I have a "please kick me down" sign on my back. This time its my boss, she hierd me for much higer wages than I am getting and when I threatend to quit she promised me the same wages again and yesterday she offers me just a small part off the sum we agreed on. I wish there was a law against this...any ways Im not gonna back down now, Maby I´ll have to find another job but  hell no  Im not backing down.

      Well still alive and kicking....I woke up this morning to the uncontrolable urge to hear the song from "Fame"...Fame, I want to live forever, I want to learn how to fly...la la la la.ohh yeah.  Im feeling a litle better now and Im going back to school and that makes me extreamly happy. I feel that now for a loong time that I have something to focus on in my future. I was gonna chicken out of this but my superboyfriend changed my mind and Im etearnally greatful. Thank you so much.  And speaking of great boyfriends, mine just called and asked me out to dinner at one of the most exspensive restaurants in town...X X X  I feel like a queen.  As for jobmatters...Im not compleatly happy but I have to stay here if I wanna go in school....so Ill just bend over!!!!

      Im really tired today...so hard to wake up.  Theres more trouble at work and Im getting so sick of this.  My boss is continually lying to me and she has lost all my trust. This time she has given the new girls a higer wage than Im getting and Ive worked here all summer. She really must dislike me and I dont know for what because Im a really good worker, Ive never been sick , I always do what is exspected of me and then some and Ive only been late once!!!  Bleeehhh  On the goodside though Im doing really well in school.

      I have such a cold and I thought I was getting better.  Oh well God must be punnishing me for stealing that half a shampobottle.  Anyways... Im going shopping today with my younger sister(12). Im buying her a dress for the Roseball. Its her birthday present.  Im thinking of buying something for myself, but everytime I see something that I like I feel like I dont deserve it. well I havent got much money anyways. I went shopping with my boyfriend on sunday, we were going to buy my some stuff for winter, God knows I need everything, but we ended buying him a shirt instead and nothing for me.  I just wish he would incourage me to dress nicely and would just generally bother, like i do for him. I tried to act as he does when hes looking for clothes but I like too much to make him happy so end up getting involved with every little detail, size , color ect...  If I think about it I dont think he bothers at all anymore, I think he does´nt even read this blog. I would be all over his to see what was going on with him. How can two people be so close and yet so far appart. Maby its all over, I mean if you just dont bother anymore how can we go on. I love him truly, but this is getting tierd.

      I miss the times when I had friends, I miss laughing over something stupid we had done. I havent had a friend in a long time, and most of the time im more than okey with that. I´ve always been a loner and Im a lousy friend when I have one. Its just that I hate talking on the phone or just talking in general.

      Well havent I been living an interesting life lately....!  I have been a litle sick and I just slept this whole weekend,  My boyfriend was very unsymphathetic and he was the one who gave me this litle flu. Apparantly he thought I wasnt as sick as he and that I was a total dramaqueen. Well okey I wasnt as sick as him but hey I have been nursing him for the whole week and now I wanted a little TLC instead of watching him play fucking warcraft 24/7.  Im thinking about my birthday thats coming up soon, I think my boyfriend will screw this one up too, he has never planned anything on my birthday and I always go all out on his to make him feel special. Ive given him a surprice party, a trip to London, out to dinner at a swanky restaurant, and thats not counting the presents. Well its what they say "give without exspecting something in return" or something???  So now Im at work and not getting any better even though Im on my second cup of pepperment tea.

      Will this never end...  I cryed at work just now, theres something really wrong with my foot and I need to go to the hospital. I went to work anyway and opend up the place thinking I could do it and then go to the hospital.  The pain just got worse and I cant fit into my shoes so I called my boss but she got really angry and just started screaming at me about her own problems. It was just to much so I started crying here at work.

      Im trying so hard to look at the bright sight of things but the buzzzz sound of the three work iceboxes are drowning all happy thoughts out. Plus I just fixed a broken washing machine and Im supposed to be a receptionist!!!  Well its a good thing Im quitting this job, Its all good and all the bad thoughts can just fuck off.   There are new people moving in to the cellar in my house, they got kids. I dont like kids much and I think people should need permission of all the house owners to move in with them. I needed one for my dog. Yes Im a kidnazi but Im really afraid the kid is going to be afraid of my dog, so my dog cant run free in MY garden. Maby my dog will just eat the little bugger and I will get some peace.

      These are strange days....  I quit my job on friday and Im feeling real good about it, I´ve never should have started here in the first place, cause I had bad vibes comming from there the minute I stepped in there. I should listen to my instinct more.  I went clubbing really hard, a little to hard on saturday and ended up having the strangest sunday.  Im thinking of taking a break from partying.

      WORKING HERE IS HELL:  Ive never had such a bitchy boss and I never knew that there were such imature people.  The last time I posted I was crying at work waiting to get to the hospital, my boss said she would not come until 9 a clock, but then she made me and my boyfriend wait untill 10:30.  And now it seems she is mad at me and slagging my name through the companys journal.  I cant wait to quitt here.

      At this timepoint of my life:  - Im reading "Becoming madame Mao" by Anchee Min. Great book and my favorite line from it so far is:    "They cant see the trouble mountain because they are on it".  -I hate drawing boxes in art class at school.  - Last movie I watched was Saltonsea wich was ok. It was about speed adictives and revenge of lost love...good combo and Val kilmer looks kind of good with a mohawk....but better as Jim Morrisson.    -

      Strange thoughts in my head at night.  Ive taken up the habbit to sleep with the covers over my head because of the cold here in Iceland...its just totally comforting, warm and dark. But my boyfriend is freaking out about it saying I can suffocate in my sleep or the dog wont see me and lay on my face and kill me. So last night I lay a wake and thought about it and concidering the cold here I think this would be a nice escape and frankly I was never meant to be born.  just kidding or am I ?.

I told him he was calling some other xxx but he wanted to know wich xxx I was. I hanged up. yukk  I have been PMSing like crazy and I have the worst period pains...I just want to go home to my hotwaterbottle and have some alchohol and painkillers in my body now....and its only 7 o´clock in the morning.

      I just had enough and over that:  Yesterday I just fell compleatly hopeless that anything in my life would be right or clean for that matter. I did not go to school or do anything cause I fellt compleatly powerless against the mess that my life is. Besides from all the emotional stuff my house looks like a place where a bum lives. The washing up has not been done in over 4 weeks, I cant remeber when the floor was last mopped, the turtle tank was starting to mold and was the deep color of reddish brown, the bed has not been changed for over 4 weeks too, our refridgerator has its own living organizasion inside it, and if that was not enough a visiting dog threw up on my pillow. I feel like a failiure and a complete slob. Well I fixed some of these things last night of course with a little help from my boyfriend but the place still looks like a dirty dump.

      Today is my second lucky day or at least I hope so. I choose my lucky number 11 when I was very young about 8 or 9 years and it has brought my luck many times. so now is the 1/11 and Electro lux (Dj felix Housecat from usa is dj´ing) is to night so I think Ill go out partying. I just have to be careful not to go overboard like last saturday. Ofcourse my luckiest day of the year is 11/11 wich is not so very far away.  This halloween stuff is every where even though we do not celibrate it here in Iceland...I love costumes and I think we are missing out.

      Theres so much talk lately about child abuse and womens rights and peace on earth.  I feel its overwhelming we got so many problems here on earth and I really think we are in hell. Yes the earth is hell and hopefully when we die we go to heaven!.  Ive read many books about the suffering of man and I am a former victim of child abuse. so I should know..shouldnt I. God Im so depressed and spitefull right now and I doubt every human beeings motives. I should be a hermit somewhere up in the mountains where I woulndt bother anyone.

      I partyed last saturday...was really strung out on sunday and am still not balancing right this morning.  My head is filled with paranoid ideas and Im feeling antisocial. I feel like everyone dislikes me. I feel like im wearing a big fake smile just because you should "smile upon the world so the world will smile upon you". But my smile is fake and so the world must give me fake smiles back?. Why do I even try to be likeble I should just frown and say fuck you to everyone, god im childish and ignorant right now aint I.

      Some people may find it interesting that BJÖRK (yes, the singer) has recently started working out here at the gym were I work. She is quite modest and unglamourus to be here in this old rundown gym.  She is really pretty in person in a normal kinda "petit" way and is really well mannerd too, not at all what you exspect from a STAR. Any ways thought it was interesting....or not.  It was extaclly fun last friday though I would NOT recomend Dj felix da housecat, he sucks bigtime and I dont care if hes the 4th higest paid Dj ever or something.  ALL THE ICELANDIC DJ´S WERE MUCH BETTER. Go Iceland go. I ve got partyfever...or at least a partycold >_ ^

      Good morning my perfect wholesome IKEA life.  Aaah yes waking up before the clock sure makes me feel rested. And after having such a wholesome weekend of great sex, ikea furniture and "The count of Monte cristo" video I feel acomplised.   My boyfriend and I just got sick of our appartment and went to Ikea and bought "möbler".  Seeing him take charge of things just really turned me on and not to mention seeing him lifting and putting together heavy furniture. Yes I am a princess and I want to be taken care of ( but dont even try to tell me what to do), and I have my prince and my castel....lucky me.

I think Im to good for this, I should be a queen on some remote paradise island (preferably a really warm one) were my devoted people would serve on me hand and foot. I like the people I work with though and exspecially my boss she is so great. I met her in a clothing store last saturday and she loaned me for these chinese green summer shoes and bargained them down for just half the price. She has my eternal love and devotion now.

      Saturday - stand me up day!  I hate weekends now, I always have these great expectations of fun and I'm nearly always let down. My mom was coming to town and was going to the mall with my sisters, I was suppose to tag along or so I thought. She's not answering her phone and I suspect she has already gone to the mall. How pathetic can one get when one is stood up by ones mom? So I try to turn to my BF for some fun, swimming or something, he's sleeping and probably will sleep all day cause he was playing the fucking Starwars game all night.   So I'm going to have fun all by my self, not that I'm used too it.  More bad news, I'm not going to Sasha, I'm working the next day. All I have now is Luxembourg after 24 days.

Thanks u all, I didn't know u cared :)  Here is a pic of "Mr. Cucumber"   urlLink Click     Any ways I'm listening to GU 25 Deep Dish in Toronto, drinking exiles Pilsner and eating a Toblerone chocolate. Its Friday, tests are over, my dog is bathed, and frankly I'm bored to death but I am too lazy to do anything. I'm trying to hold out the partying until Shasha plays here in Iceland 19th of May. I'm looking forward to next weekend: my adopted brother and his girl are inviting us to see their new apartment which they have been remodeling and renovation. So a nice cozy "red wine night" to look forward there.  Well I'm over out for now.

Your uhu.. big cucumber!!! 7. I love the way you smell with or with out perfume. 6. I love the sound of your voice. 5. I love to go out with you dancing, you are always the sexiest guy on the dancefloor. 4. I love your truthfulness and your sincerity and loyalty. 3. I love the way you have helped me, saved me and encouraged me in so many ways. 2. I love when you make me laugh and I love to make you laugh. 1. I love everything about you.  So there, happy now?

      How many times have I been on the stairstepper in the gym blasting (on full volume in my ipod) some great dance tune and wanted (needed) to shout whooohooo. And how many times have I been at it on the dance floor and got this incredible feeling exploding all over my body and you come one with the music. I love music and music loves me and together we're happy. Music controles me, wakes me up, makes me happy, makes me cry, makes me remember and makes me dance. I love dance music, old hippie rock, some deliriously silly 80's hits, old soothing jazz, Greek music, new age music, britrock, and the list goes on.....and on.  My top 10 dance tunes which I am listening to now (in no special order):  1. Star Catching Girl - Sander Kleinenberg 2. Barcelona - D-Kay & Epsilon (Stamina Mix) 3. More Lemonade - Bucci bag 4. Diamond Girl - Chirez D 5. Comfortably Numb - Sicssor Sisters 6. Cant make up my mind - Sonique (Robbie Rivera Mix) 7. Only when I loose myself - Depech mode (lexicon avenue mix) 8. Running up that hill - Kate Bush vs Infusion 9. Drink deep - Dave Brennan 10. Safe from harm - Narcotic Trust.  I know some of these are really old, but they die hard. Well I should be studying for my English exam which is at 18:00, but I'm gonna dance a little on my living room floor first with my dog. She likes music too. ;Þ

      I hope people don't misunderstand when I say that my relationship with my boyf. is going badly. We still love each other very much but we seem to be having some communication problems. I guess after 6 years together things might slow down a bit.  I admit I can be a bit of a dramaqueen and an attention freak but I hate the thought that I will never be good enough for my boyf. to propose to me. Enough said, I'm tired of tired things, lets be happy!

      The Danish exam went well, I hope, at least I answered all the questions but are my answers right! Then I went home and after all the intellectual stuff I had do do something creative, you can see the results here  urlLink  click   Tell me if you like anything there, (of course the e stamp isn't on the originals).  I went to the dentist this morning and everything is ok with my pearly whites, but my purse is hurting like hell after this two wisits to the doctors, overpriced critters aren't they. You may have noticed I don't talk about my boyfriend as much as I used to, we are still together but things have been going badly, more later on that. I have to get my butt to work now.

      I should be studying but I'm feeling down. Feeling ugly, stupid and poor and fat. I was at the doctors to day, I had a mole under my breast checked, it was ok, but he said he wanted to take it anyways... and that would leave a scar. I'm going to wait and see for a few months, I'm to egotistic to scar my lovely boobies for a maybe. I've got 4 hours to test time I better make use of them. In the mean time enjoy this:  urlLink  click   and I thought I had problems.

      Study time today, even though I'm going to take time out to go swimming and eat the pineapple. How does one eat a pineapple??? I bought a bubblegun yesterday at the mall, It made me happy like a kid ;Þ I also bought strawberry perfume and papaya bodylotion and I sure smell like summer now, yes ma'am. The coworker I went with was so hard to go shopping with, this person has got some serious issues, I feel like tons of bricks are laid upon me when she is around. I am not a superwoman and I cant save the world, you or your dog......

      I Love getting emails like these:  Hi Eva,  How are you? I saw you picture and must admit that you are gorgeous. send me an email ifyou want to start chatting (pictures will be appreciated!!). I am male, 28 from Athens. What are you doing this summer? Any possibility of accepting an invitation to cruise the Greek islands on my yacht??  Awaiting,  Nick.  Thank you Mr.Nick, you have made my day, put a smile on my face and boosted up my ego. If I didn't have such a lovely boyfriend I would probably consider the idea. Yes I'm an adventures slut, who cares. I'm wondering which picture he saw though!!!  I went on a holiday to Crete last summer and loved the Greek sun,food,places etc...  Anyways the Eurovision song contest is to night and I've been waiting in vain for an invitation to Euro s.c.party. So its just going too be the two of us, a bottle of wine, some snacks and candles. The Greeks are suppose to win so good luck Nick.  And I've got a favorite movie now: The butterfly effect. It had a tremendous effect on me. I cried and cried and it made me feel ill to my stomach. But that's what I loved about it and of course the constant surprises. Ashton Kutcher is a great actor even though I never thought highly of him before. This film is a must see.  see ya later alligator...

      Yes I should live alone upon a mountain far far away from everyone. Unless Im drunk ;)             You Are An Introvert!  You're not necessarily anti-social, but you do tend to need a lot of alone time.  You tend to think before you talk, which doesn't make you the loudest person in the room.  While you aren't outgoing, you are a good listener - and you tend to be a loyal friend.  And you enjoy your friends as much as any extrovert does, in smaller doses.  You're more of a conversation over dinner type than a party animal... and so are all your friends..

      So yesterday was good. My bf spoiled me rotten, gave me flowers, and shoes. We didn't go out on saturdaynight, our friend bailed on us but we had a pretty nice night in watching "Slap her she's French". It's a hilarious film I haven't laughed so much in a long time. Last night I watched for the first time "2001 a space odyssey" I think you need some acid or something to understand that movie, It would probably cancel each other out and the movie would make perfect sense. God is a black box and we all end up floating in space as little blobby fetuses, yes I see it now of course it makes sense.

      I am so starting to love blogger, now I can post pictures and a picture says more than words.  Not much news though, I've been working more than usual. Yesterday I dusted my shoes and threw out a lot of old clothes. I wonder if I will miss some of the things I threw out. There should be some kind of clothes therapy for people with "It might come back in fashion syndrome".   And there should be law against buying ugly furniture: The BF. went shopping for an officechair and brought home this monster from Ikea. Its a big black 80's monster that hovers over all our apartment. Its so big I feel like a little kid in it and I'm afraid it will eat me.   I'm out and over and I don't have a dog called rover.   urlLink    I'm so arty farty  test?

But drama tires me, so I will keep on smiling and find things to look forward too. Like 2 weeks to Luxembourg, and few hours till the Bf. comes home. Summer is almost here fullblast. I'm just happy to be!  After while crocodile...

      Well the weekend was a real mess, I've realized I'm a cold hearted biach who deserves to live alone. This is just how I was brought up. I had no friends and no family, even my mom and dad wanted nothing to do with me. So I have real intimacy and trust issues. I'm so emotionally overdriven that I'm afraid of getting depression again. But don't worry I wont let that happen ever again I'd rather jump of a cliff with the other lemmings. Just when I was getting comfortably numb this had to happen, can I just blank it out and pretend its not such a big deal? Nothing is really such a big deal anyways, I mean we all die in the end no matter what our actions. Don't worry I'm too self-absorbed to kill my self I'm just saying does it really matter what we do in our lifetime?  Fuck it

      I've been a good girl today, I showed up for work sick today and got better instantly. You couldn't tell I was the winy sick little sorry thing I was yesterday. God I really thought my head would explode. So anyways I had a nice afternoon with my co-worker/friend. She is a little younger than me (almost 5 years)but we seem to be on the same wavelength. I'm always a little afraid meeting someone new, commitment phobia of death here. We went to a coffee house and had a nice little tea party. God I'm so civilized. I like her, she has this tough shell on the outside but she is just a little cute fluffy kitten on the inside.   I'm off to Luxemburg in 8 days, I cant wait and I love having something to look forward to, it makes me energetic and happy.  To morrow we have to sort out the penultimate payment of our apartment with the bank so whish us good luck.   urlLink    Snowqueen

      I'm almost ready to go, I've been waxed,hydrated,plucked,pampered,colored.... and the list goes on and on. I feel like a million dollar duck with a tiara. Haven't packed a thing though,that's so unlike me, I usually do it like a month before. The dog hates it when we take the travelcase down, she knows we're leaving so she is glued to our legs and every time we look at her she gives us this "sad puppy eyed don't go" look. Ah she breaks my heart with that but I know she'll have a very good time with her grandma.   Well not much else to say but Bon voyage and Bye everyone.   P.s. Ill try to blog a little in Lux.

I hope everyone have gotten their invitations, I haven't had a lot of response???  Any one got a good recipe for a light blue or a white cocktail?  I hope it will be a blast and every one can show up :)     urlLink    Party flyer - invitation.  by moi

      I love sunny days soooo much even though they come on workdays. I went swimming after work and when I say swimming I actually mean sunbathing and now I got this kinky bikiniline which reminds me of 80's porn. I miss pree 90's porn, the women were so natural, no cosmetic surgeries or photoshop and still the girls looked oh so pretty.   Work wasn't so bad to day but still I have to find another job, a more presentable job or just anything where I'm not embarrassed to tell people what I do. I would love to work at a solarium or as gym receptionist, maybe even a petstore.   As for Partying I'm thinking of having a party or something Saturday 3/7 ??? Any Ideas and most important will the HAWK be landed ? ;)  cuddles and kisses  for you and your misses.

      Well Lux was a blast, even though it was a little strange not staying in a hotel. Now I kind of miss having lots of people around though. I did all the regular tourist things: Partying, sunbathing, shopping and sightseeing. I especially loved the Butterfly House in Grevemacher and the Zoo (somewhere in France).  The party scene in Luxembourg is a little off but I did go to a number of clubs, Melosina and the VIP Room were the best of the town.  urlLink Click here for pictures    Any ways I had such a strange dream last night. I was making out with my friends ex girlfriend but feeling extremely guilty at the same time because I didn't want to cheat on my BF. And the strange thing is I never consider this girl attractive and I don't even think about her, ever! Lets just blame it on "Post vacation depression"  I´m still in Party mode though and I miss all my friends so much, lets make something happen?

      Superstar sister.  My sister (12 years old) has landed her first movie role. She recently wanted to become an actress and what a great start. I even think she got a speaking role. The movie is a sequel to a famous Icelandic music/cult movie ,Stuðmenn: Með allt á hreinu. They choose her because she is so tanned and they are doing a beach scene. I'm awfully proud of my little star.

      Eureka !!! I have discovered that Iceland has a beach and I've been playing beach bunny three afternoons in a row, I think this will be my summer habitat from now on. I love the mixture of sun, sea and sand. I wish it would get a little warmer here in Iceland. The sea water was only about 16°C, so I stay mainly in the hottub and dream of Crete and Spain. I'm homesick for a warmer climate but I'm thankful for this new discovery, it will keep me sane until my next&nbsp; adventure abroad.&nbsp;   Added some new&nbsp;art  urlLink   here ....    if you are interested.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Someone is playing a trick on me, Who has registered me on&nbsp;a&nbsp;datingweb???  Fess up, I'm not really angry because I've been laughing my self silly with some of the letters I've got, like this one:  &nbsp;  Hi lady  I saw your profile in private.is&nbsp; but I can't understand anything about you because I don't know the Icelandic language and we say here in our area the beautiful eyes says all the story so I'll talk what I understand from your photo . You are very kind heart and so smart lady  you have worm which is better not to reach the snow of the Icelandic mountains because he will melt it ,  and I thank my god a lot when I saw your photo clearing just one eye of yours because if I see the tow eyes am sure my heart will be shocked , and just that moment I knew why the gold is so expensive when I saw the color of your hair and must great poetry in the all history of the humanity and which I know it very well I think it's not enough to describe your smile and which it says : ( and I remembered you when the spears was fleshing my body&nbsp; and the white swords bleeding me so I would like to kiss the sharpen edges of them because it's shines like your smile )&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My lady  Am sure that every one see you or your photo will write more than what I wrote but I would like in this message to let you know that there is in the other side of the world a man how saw your photo and couldn't stop thinking of you and all what he hope now to answer this message to him &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Man with out his hear  Please turn his hear back  &nbsp;   end of letter   &nbsp;  I just want to see what&nbsp;photo has such a big impact on men and then show it to my BF ;Þ  &nbsp;

       Take 2!    Today the sun shines and all day my mind is filled with hopes of sunbathing after work. As I walk home I look up to the sky for any suspicious rainclouds and decide I should get at least an hour of sun. So again I do the suncreme ritual and this time my stuff is all ready in the bag and my hair is allready up. I step out side and the sun still shines, but as soon as I get in the pool it starts to rain!!!! I cant begin to describe my disappointment, so I wont....

      Strange Day.   Today at work a coworker told me out of the blue that she really likes her boyfriend hitting her while having sex! She then told me this story about when they were really drunk and he started punching her (at her own request).&nbsp; What do you say to people like this, I mean what the did she expect me to say, so I just nodded and said huh and got back to work.   And then after being frying in the heat at work all day I thought I'd go sunbathing, I hurry home and put on&nbsp;sunlotions and put my hair up, get my bikini, ipod, book, brush and towel in a bag and run out. As soon as I step out side&nbsp;a big cloud covers the sun and five minutes later it rains.   SPF 30&nbsp;and tears ran down my face as I poured a glass of bubbly and sorted out my mp3's.

But my mom, my boss and my BF have been plotting this together for over a week now. I'm leaving in only two weeks, and even one of my friends will be there (not at the same hotel though). I'm incredibly grateful to everyone involved and I cant wait to fell the sun in my face and sand and sea on my feet. I cant wait to spend some time with my family but&nbsp;I will miss The BF so much...  The almost luckiest girl in the world  &nbsp;
