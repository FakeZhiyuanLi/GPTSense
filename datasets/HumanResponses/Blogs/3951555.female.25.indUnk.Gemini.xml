           So are my days wasted at work. That's right. Work! I finally got a job. After almost exactly 50 days of jobsearch I've finally snagged one. It's a good thing too, considering I was getting awfully tired of the MN Workforce website and those silly tests that the temp agencies make you take.   So far I'm just a temp, but I guess they hire a lot on. I landed a job at a little place called&nbsp; XXXXXXXX (names have been changed to X's to protect the innocent - me). Basically it's a printing company. I work in one of those O ffice Space -esque offices. I literally work in a cubicle maze. They actually have a red carpet hallway so people know where the halls are and where to actually walk. It's pretty depressing. I'm tempted to print out a picture of Peter Gibbons and stick it in my cubicle, but I think I'll feel the place out for a bit. The other busy bees might get offended.   My job is to enter incoming faxes, letters&nbsp;and emails into a database. We work with insurance companies and print all the paper flyer junk they're always handing out. So, my daily task is to enter insurance agents and realtors into our massive poorly designed system. Soon I'll be talking to the realtors and listening to them yell at me about their business cards. It's not the perfect job for a recent MIS major. But hey, I was getting tired of the credit card company calling me all the time.   One question that was asked of me today was, "So, do you know a lot about computers?" I wanted to make some snide remark about how I just blew $50,000 for a BBA in MIS and now I'm punching addresses and names into a computer all day. I kept quiet except for a chuckle and a yeah.   Perhaps, if the job goes well, I'll work to infiltrate the IT department and show them a thing or two. The girl who programs the web forms we do needs some help. For instance, one form's send button actually says, "sent" and a redirected page that reads, "Thank you. You message has been send." Ok ok... so she's Russian and they give her a little bit of slack. But cmon! Why the hell did they require me to take a proofreading test at the temp agency?   On another work related note... I actually think I went to camp when I was little with one of the guys in my little department. I'm thinking it was either the tree hugger camp I went to or the bible banger camp that I got talked into going to... definately not the horse camp i went to though. (I'll hafta share the stories of my hardcore tree hugger days... oh those were the good olde days).   What the hell, we'll just make this an all Laura's job post.   Get this.... The Culligan water at XXXXXXX is actually free!!!! YES! Settle down people, you're not the only one who's shocked and excited! Here's a short story. Gather round.   I worked at a bank in Duluth the last year I was up there. It was a small local bank, owned by Mr Mob Boss himself... Geno Palucci (ok, someone searched through google for Geno Palucci and found my page.. I really don't know if he's a Mob boss. It's a local rumor)***ALRIGHT! That's two searches for Geno Palucci... next person who finds this (via google) must leave a comment.*** I could rant for hours about that place. The quick lowdown: horribly run, horrible management, ladies named Dxxx who treats coworkers like shit and who's kids would call 30 times a day. While at work I read the entire Harry Potter series over&nbsp;a matter of 3 months. Basically 10.00/hr to put up with a couple of mean ladies and do absolutly nothing 3/4ths of the time.   Well, it had gotten towards the end of the school year and I was finding myself running short on funds. So, I did the right thing. I quit drinking pop and stuck with water. They had a culligan machine in the coffee room. I thought, hey! I'll have some! and I then proceeded to fill my big nalgene bottle up. I went back the next day and there was a note sitting on the top of the water cooler. It read something like this, "This water is paid for by RXXXXX Bank employees. If you would like to use this water, please pay Mindy $4.00 payable on the 15th of every month you wish to use this water." So I did it, and abused it. I filled my big nalgene bottle up two... somtimes three times a day.   I always got a kick out of how elite some of the employees there acted. Mostly because they were proud to be working for RXXXXX BANK! I'd now like to salute the lifers there. Have fun going down in a fiery ball of flames with that retched bank. I guarantee you, that within 20 years that bank has either gone through some MAJOR business restructuring or completely gone under.   Wow! I should write useless rants more often. That felt surprisingly good!             Mood:  Surprsingly good consdering the circumstances.    Song I'm listening to right now:  Dashboard Confessionals&nbsp;- Vindicated (yeah... I know)     &nbsp;    Picture:  The picture above is me right around Halloween I have no idea of the year, but I was little.&nbsp;Wasn't I a cutie? Gladly, I can't picture myself in a leotard nowadays.

       So I think I may have found a new addiction. I've had to force myself not to create new post after new post on here and I just signed up yesterday.&nbsp; Perhaps I needed something like this. An independant eyeball to read my weird rantings.  &nbsp;  I'm somewhat glum today. I keep sighing that woe-is-me sigh. I'm missing my Greenman Festival in good old Duluth. I went to the very first Greenman. Sat atop a hill and watched some terrific bands perform. We even got visited by one Mr. Brownie Dave. And I can't forget meeting that character who called himself Doogie Doogen. I wonder whatever happened to that guy and his entourage.  &nbsp;         GOD how I miss Duluth. I never expected to get this homesick for the little town I had called home for 7 years. It almost makes me want to cry just thinking about it. Duluth's a great city.  &nbsp;  I miss the sound of the fog horn. I miss watching that Duluth fog roll down the street. I miss the brewhouse and their loverly brews! Mostly the Witchtree and fruity beers they specialize in. I miss my chinese restaurants because I still haven't found a decent substitute in this boring town called St Cloud. I miss the familiarity of the roads! Dammit did I get good at timing the lights on those one ways. There's no ethnicity in this town! Everyone's white! Everyone goes to church! Everyone is republican! Gah! Perhaps someday I'll move back to the town I love so much.   More than anything I miss my Duluth friends. And just as much I think I miss the Duluth music scene. Even though the wednesday night Black Label events at the Red Lion had somewhat dissapeared, I was still able to catch them ocassionally.&nbsp; Here may be a good time to confess my huge crush on the lead singer (is he the lead singer anymore? *shrugs*) with the long dreads and sexy accent. Maybe the fact that I saw him staring at me from the window of a City of Duluth van did it (head turned and out the window stare as they drove past!! *giggly gasp*). Too bad I only had 2 or 3 fleeting conversations with him. Also, too bad for me because I think he's married. Oh well, it doesn't hurt for a girl to lust does it?  &nbsp;  On a side note. If anyone actually reads this, and you have access to any type of Black Label paraphenalia (i.e. cds or shirts) lemme know. I missed out on the tshirt opportunity at the Red Lion due to excessive consumption of cheap Black Label beer.  &nbsp;  I just thought of something else I miss.... strangely.&nbsp; My cute little apartment and the crazy neighbors. Sure, I saw boob and dick out my bathroom window in the apartment across the way, but the other crazy ocurrences make up for that. Sure I could hear the gay guys upstairs having the loudest sex I've ever heard but I quickly got used to that. Sure the cuban B that lived downstairs blasted the rock radio station in town, but I got used to that too. I should mention the goth dominatrix chick with the skinhead boyfriend who had a little teensy toy poodle size terrier doggy. I miss my old apartment. That teeny apartment that you had to close the door to the bathroom in order to even see the toilet. The teeny apartment that had a slime monster growing under the kitchen sink. I miss my old landlord. Bah, I'm just wallowing in the pity right now.  &nbsp;  Put it this way, I really really really miss Duluth.&nbsp; Damn Greenman and damn the fact that I have no money!&nbsp; Duluth sweet Duluth we will be reunited soon and I will weep into your bosom as I drive around and down the hill into all your glorious splendor.  &nbsp;  God I need to find a job.

        So it seems that these weblog things are all the rage. I thought I'd have a go at being hip. I'm not quite sure if it'll be a successful attempt as I'm quite the nerd. We'll see how it goes though.       Let's give this a try.       A little snippet about myself. A 25 year old Minnesota girl. Born and raised and YES I love it here! I recently graduated from college with a BBA in Management Information Systems (I toldja I was a nerd). I've been in a relationship with my oh-so-cute and adoring boyfriend Bill. I'll save&nbsp;a Billiam&nbsp;post for later however as I could ramble.   Upon graduation I moved out of the apartment with Bill and in with the 'rents. It's been a strange experience to put it one way. I love my parents to death, we get along great, but living back home after 7 years is a little strange. Oh well, the rent is cheap (free for now) and the food is cheap (also free for now), so I can't complain. I've got the basement to myself, complete with a mini fridge... you could put a 6 pack of bee... er... pop in there. The only time I have to wander up to civilization is to get food.   MUSIC! I luuurrve music. Specially the local minnesota scene. I've been straying away from the mainstream music scene for a while now, and I'm happy to say I'm almost completely out of the loop. I'm a big fan of the Big Wu and I have my good friend Shannah Banana to thank for that. Some of the local bands/musicians that I've been into lately are... The Big Wu, Mason Jennings, Atmosphere, The Black Labels, The Black Eyed Snakes, Trampled By Turtles and again, I'll come up with more eventually.   BEER! Yes... Mmm tasty beer. If i had my pick I'd have to say Duff beer is my favorite. No, seriously.... probably a good Hornsbys. Red Label. You keep those green label ones for yourself. I'm also a fan of Newcastle, guiness, summit, and yes... the cheap Premium. It's a Minnesota beer, I wouldn't be surprised if you've never heard of it. And, if the moment doesn't call for beer, I'll take a White Russian. Yes, just like the dude. And I do mix a helluva caucasian. Just ask the drunk girl at the parties I used to go to.   My family... I've got a younger brother Claydoh. He's a really great guy and way cooler than I am. He's got a darling little baby girl who is one of the biggest joys in my life. Madison Dawn. She's almost a year and a half now. And, I know I'm biased but she's a baby genius! Since I'm such the doting auntie I'll post some pictures of her on here sometime. Claydoh (yeah... his real name's clay) lives with his girliefriend Jessica and Madison. That's it for siblings. And then I've got my parents. Ahhhh my parents. I love em. They're hippies turned middle age. My dad described himself, way back when, as a diehard liberal. My dad's currently semi-retired. Mom works as an insurance agent. I can tell my parents anything. They're the kind of parents that I would like to be when I'm older, cept well... i'll be a mom, not both.   I just realized how badly i've rambled here. I've probably lost everyone that's read this. Oh well, if you've made it this far, I give you credit. And just for making it this far, I'll supply you with a link of much hilarity.     urlLink  http://www.rockpapersaddam.com/index.html    &nbsp;  Enjoy. :)       Random thought of the night: I've killed probably 10 of these teeny tiny little gnaty type things. I have no idea where they're coming from but they're uber attracted to my monitor. Seems like as good a killing ground as any. I'll wipe the grody bug smears off sometime.        Added Random thought: I'm a bit lazy when it comes to capitalization. You must now learn to deal.          Mood:  2 notches above meh (I'm missing out on my Greenman festival due to lack of funds due to the fact that I have no job yet)  Check it out.... *big dramatic sigh*   urlLink  http://www.greenmanfestival.com       Song I'm listening to:  The Big Wu - Dancing With Lula
