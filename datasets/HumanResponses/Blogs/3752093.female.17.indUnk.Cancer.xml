      i'm just making trouble for myself in a place where it doesn't have to be. and i will  stop  thinking about it because i know that i do not want to lose such a great thing.   a friend told me yesterday, "DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT. DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT. in my opinion he is the best thing that has ever happened to you."  and the thing is...i've never been more happy...  i don't think im being clingy.  it's not like i've spent tons of time with him during the school year. in fact, i hardly ever saw him during the school day. it is just the simple fact that i miss him, and i don't think that's being clingy at all.   i am finally  happy ...in the past...it was off and on due to some particular events...but now it has been consistent...and that is a  first  for awhile now.

         As we grow up we go through many  firsts . First tooth, first step, first test, first birthday cake, first trip to the zoo, first job, first school-day, first allowance, first friend...the list goes on and on.      Sometimes i wish that i could relive my first firsts. it seems that most of the ones i have listed have been constant in my life. what i mean is that after you experience it once, you will most likely experience it again, which i have. i've experienced first school-days for more than 12 years. i have experienced birthday cakes every year. what i want to experience is my first one ever. i want to have that cheerful optimism about the events to come after it. of course i still have that cheerful optimism, but it's different. when it is your first time u are doing something which u have no clue on what's going to happen next, but since you have already experienced it you are able to have more control, more feel for the area. of course that's not a bad thing. but things are so much more special when you experience things for the first time.   i admit i haven't experienced love yet. my definition of love is much more detailed. of course, i can say it sarcastically, and i'll even say it on-line. but in person ...there is no way i could do that, just yet. i want to really mean it. and when that day comes...whomever i say it to will truly know that i love them. of course...i love my friends and family, but what i'm talking about is love for another person, love for someone you truly like to be around, love for someone that will make you smile in the good and the bad. love...is a strange and miraculous thing, it is once of the most happiest and strongest feelings one can hold for another.     my life right now is on the complicated side. Actually, i guess you can say it isn't. it's been more consistent, than complicated. Monday to Friday I've been going to my internship at the Washington Hospital Center, and on Saturday and Sunday I've been working at Riderwood. Right now, i have a boyfriend, but it seems as if we're drifting because we haven't spoken in awhile. in a long while. i cannot express to you enough how much of a great guy he is. he is really sweet, and honest. i miss him. sometimes i doubt that i'm not exactly that similar to him. i've told only two of my friends this. and this is what they said:      "you're doubting yourself because things are going so well for you...and u think that it will all end...but i promise you they wont...good things happen to good people. people who work too much esp." "are you serious? hoesntly, the only reason why we went to that fancy restuarant was for you. he really wanted to impress you."  i guess im doubting myself because of what has happened this year. and that life has never been as good as it is now. thank god.  i guess i don't know what's going to happen next...but i guess we'll see what happens. life throws us twists and turns which are always fun.   though i do wish things were easier...next year is senior year for me. and things are going to be so hectic. there's college applications, exams, job, classes, etc. but im ready for it...but im ready.   i miss everyone soo much...

      this is a hard essay to write about because the topic overlaps with many of the ideologies floating in todays society of politics and life itself. there are so many flaws a person can have, but how can you make the ultimate decision of determining what your perfect flaw is? i'm going to take the route less traveled and try to explain a flaw that's very complicated, which unfortunately i believe i possess. i paint a picture of how i want my life to be, and strive to get every single detail in it accomplished to make it perfect. in many ways this is a terrific flaw to have because everything is organized, everything was thought about in a process so intrinsic that it relates to the whole boggling mess of controversial issues in the newspapers of yesterday and tomorrow. but how can this flaw serve to be something that can hurt a person? you do not take it easy. you're not as spontaneous as you want to be. you're consistent and non-sporadic. every detail is so mapped out that you forget about what might not happen, and it's too late to make a back-up plan. you never let life surprise you because you can't stand to know what might not happen. in many ways, i love having this flaw. i've learned to push it away when i can't stand the thought of living a life filled with no originality. so i guess we can say that it is no longer my flaw. i have learned to take control of it, and not the other way around. or this could just be me trying to make everything perfect again by trying to get rid of something that intersects with the subject of this essay the or it could just be me analyzing this issue way too much.    edit  my new perfect flaw: analyzing
