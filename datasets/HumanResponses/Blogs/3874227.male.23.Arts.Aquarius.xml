      from st marks place to the racist rants of the path  to boonton in the dark  as the freeway swerves by  seven people in a four seater      i was walking down st marks place when i ran into simon.i asked where the punk venues were in this city.he explained the new york punk scene as a drop in a pool of water.the middle being the core and the larger rings being increasingly shitty music.someone in the group that simonwas with said "lets go to coney island".i had never been to coney island so i decided to go.i told my friends, that i was going to go to coney island with these srangers and they told me to have fun. right after i left they decided not to go to coney island.instead they decided to go to new jersey.i said "fuck it" and decided to follow. we started walking to the path(the train that goes from ny to nj).they buy beer and steal stuff then when we get to the path a couple people jump the turnstyle then someone,simon,i think gave me a dollar.we go on the path and evryone except me is drunk as fuck and causing a lot of playful raucus.when we transfer there is this evil bitch whining and yelling at us then she starts yelling hella racist shit at the people i was with and everyone gets real quite. we get off the path and squeeze 7 deep in shielas four seater and dylan drives us to boonton.it doesnt take long before i realize he is very drunk but im squeezed in so all i can do is put on my seatbelt.its really late so theres not too many people out,so i feel a little bit better about it ,but i had to pee and i whined about it. after about twenty minutes we got to "boonton" new jersey.we went into this kid stinkys basement and evryone got really fucked up(except me).the backyard at the house was awesome.there was a coi pond and a garden.they all kept picking on this kid toby.it was pretty funny.dylan kept vomiting all over the basement.that was really funny. eventually everybody split up to different houses to sleep.i went with dylan and his sister ashley.they were evry hospitable and very nice.they made me pizza and then stinky,who was their cousin it turns out and toby came by.i went upstairs to use the computer and toby threw up in their sink.we took pictures on dylans camera that i hope he e-mails to me and then they set me a place on the couch to sleep. i woke up to sheila and simon at the door.simon ate a cheese sandwich then we left.we picked up toby then looked for cheap gas. on the drive back to the path i noticed how pretty new jersey is.when we got to the path toby jumped the gate again and somebody gave simon some change and sheila gave me two dollars before she dropped us off,so we got on the path and headed back to nyc,toby,simon and me that is.when simon and i got to 14th st he showed me how to get back to brooklyn.he saw some of his friends on the way and introduced me.i think one of their names was fleabab.when i got back home i slept.   ill continue the other story i was telling later today so as not to get too off track.   thank you to all the people i met.you showed me great hospitality and fed me!

      first      in the sea of       grass greener wishes     was for the silk      or softness      to purify       while i live      in filth and weak poems      and weakness      in lonliness cliched      beyond recougnition  i began to wish for the fights                 for the fear                 to be the belligerent asshole                 to be of hate                              waited on                              hand and foot                               by angels                              i began                               to wish                              to corrupt this is the sick paradox of american lust  the only ugliness ive known on par with it are in the symptyoms of love                so where was i?i started to miss my ex girlfriend so i started to look around for a new somebody.the first person i found i cant reveal for fear of ruining their relationship. well about this time my friend lane and my friend jason(jason was my ex-girlfriend's brother)started to drink alot and hang out on telegraph.lane and i would do coke or heroin.lane's still pretty fuckn hardcore.i would constantly be blown out of my mind on coke and lie about it to everybody.liz and i were still doing a little bit of heroin too. one day i went down to telegraph blown out of my fuckn mind in a ridiculous shirt and these 400 dollar glasses my roommate stole from someone in pleasant hill.i went to this place on telegraph lane ,jason and i called "the spot". the spot was located in front of this place called the"t-shirt orgy" and across the street from this meat market bar called "blakes". when i got to the spot,they're were two girls there.they were dressed very trendy and both very pretty.the one i was interested in was in i later found out was named parker. i called up jason and lane and told them to meet me at the spot.they arrived shorttly. i gave lane the glasses and then asked the girls who looked better in them. they said lane and i agreed.just then a guy walking down the street told lane nice glasses. we asked the girls if they wanted to go to a party later that night and thy said maybe one of them gave us their cell phone number.before i left i realized that i knew parker from the days when i used to hangout in probo park and sell ecstacy and write graffiti.i have to get into that story before i finish this one,no i dont have to but i want to.       when i was 18 all i cared about in the entire world was break-dancing and graffiti art.this was in 1999 so the rave scene was insane and lived it up to the fullest,except i didnt dress like a cereal box.i would hang out in berkeley but i lived about 30 miles away in benicia.i would take the bart to berkeley everyday.i had a big graffiti crew called MNC for "my noble crime". one day i was wandering the streets slone all night and i kept seeing this one guy over and over again.his name was paco he did graffiti too.we met up with his friend mesa and bombed all night.i started to become good friends with paco.paco started to introduce me to his friends. one day i went to meet paco in berkeley at probo park.id brought a shitload of cans and markers to get my name up in berkeley.i also had two hits of ecstacy that my friends seceret and nemo stole from some kids at a party at my house.before paco got there i tried to sell the ecstacy.i came up to two kids and asked them if they wanted to buy a hit. the girl said "said ive only got ten bucks" "they cost twenty"i said i started to walk away. then the other kid yelled"ive got ten" i walked back,"you wanta to get one?"i asked "whats the poin,if only one of us can get high?" i walked away quite vexed. minutes later paco skates up and introduces me to the same two kids.one whose name i cant remember the other was raquel............ .................im well aware of this round about ass way of story telling i have,and in promise ill get to evrything in due time................................................................... raquel was  very beautiful with light skin,dreads and a small tattoo of a gecko behind her ear.she was brazilian and wanted to get drunk.i just wanted to do graffiti.paco,raquel and i all walked up to raquel's friend savanah's house.i did graffiti all the way there.i didnt notice that the ecstacy i had,had been dipped in acid. when we got to the house we all started to drink.paco said he wanted to get some pot and everyone agree but me.i was starting to feel kinda wierd and i didnt know why.they got all their money together and paco and raquel left to get pot. about 10 minutes later,raquel came back,saying had been arressted.this sucked a whopping shitload,because paco had warrants.we all sat there sad and i thought about whether or not i should leave.about twenty minutes later paco come back with a whole ounce of pot.he tells us the cops let him go and put the pot on the corner and forgot about,the dealer left so he got all the pot. "you have to smoke now!" he said and it was true and i did. by the second hit the acid had kicked in and i started to flip out.  i left savanahs house and started to walk aimlessly around berkeley,raquel followed me. with the moon full and warm air around us,in a very gentle voice she asked"you're mot really flipping out,you just wanted to be alone,huh?" i was stunned and fucked up beyond belief. "you're very beautiful,you're one of the coolest people i've met in a long time,but right now iam truly fucked up"i said as nice as possible. she looked hurt,but we kept walking. we ended up sitting on a leather chair in fron of some colleges kids' house.we saw paco skate by in the distance. "fuck,now what the fuck am i gonna do?" "you can stay at savanah's place" "is that cool?"yeah,itll be fine" we walked up to savanah's house and in the dark on the bottom bunk of savanah's bed raquel introduced me into the world of flesh.  ok ill tell you the rest of this story and get back to parker in the next entry,im sorry im so round about.

      of women and guns  tranquil and emaculate through the imperfections and filth and grime,though  light gleams, and the world stands, still.  an epic past  presumed,from the suspicious  lack of serial numbers, chisled off,and now its form fastenend  to my hand strength or endless freedom with sublime  consequence.some will tell you,your index finger  can define  your naked contents like a god.  a far better badge of self i have found  in the precious seconds of solitude,and how  you paint them, while waiting for a new lover's return.to  know both,to chase both life and solace with the fury of a demon.      i took a shower and i feel better,so ill continue the story.    assholejosh comes back withn a gun and points it at lane demanding lane give back his keys.lane gets down on his knees holds out both hands and say"shoot me then,motherfucker."i start yelling"give him the fucking keys lane.this continues.i yell "call the police".assholejosh cocks back the gun.just then my roommate aaron jumps on assholejosh.everyone else there jumps on him too and i grab the gun when it hits the ground. the cops come and within a week,we're evicted. so aaron and i decide to get a place in berkeley.its a run down frat house on frat row.its one big room we share.i start taking ecstasy everyday and eating mushrooms.i also start hanging out a co-op called castro a lot and i meet a girl named liz. one night i go to a party my band is having in san francisco on the beach.while im there i take mushrooms and then the cops come.of coure the cops dont give a fuck about me but i cant comprehend that.i cant find my ride and my hands start to go numb.i find my ride and they take me back to castro.i talk to myself the whole way back.when we do get back i go straight to the bathroom. written on the wall is "jesus lives"or something very similar.i take this as a sign from god to stop taking hallucenagens and smoking pot.    well,heroin and cocaine are narotics.i cant properly express my confused and fragile mindset at the time or relay any logic that may shed light on my thought process at the time. liz from castro,had never done heroin before and wanted to try.i asked my friend shane to get some for her and i gave her half of what she paid for.

      what it is            to be a dried up crustacean           or banacle on the rocks            of the point reyes coastline            to withstand the strength           of oceans,            to brace            the power of the sun,  as hours branch into years            to be loved           as such                  to be loved                  as                    a prayer     so instead of taking a shower i went and bought a mushroom swiss cheeseburger,a milkshake and some rice.  the inescapable lonliness,of this enourmous city is unfathomable.     the reason i started doing heroin again was because i was in love.well sort of.the girl i was in love with(and still am) left to go to new york city and in a very short amount of time found a new boo.my answer was to bombard myself with drugs.i knew i had a problem with coke and heroin,so i stuck to pot and alchohol,for a while.pot and alchohol are boring as fuck,so i start to do mushrooms.at this point i live in a small little tweaker crapfest called pleasant hill.my roomate there was named jody,he was very nice and was in a punk band called botskurd. one day jody took too many mushrooms and tried to kill me in my sleep. after that he went into an asylum and i was living with two housemates aaron and zach.they kept the house the hangout for all the surrounding towns and we had punk shows there.one night this asshole named josh who i will refer to as assholejosh got drunk and pulled a knife on me,then tried to kiss me.my friend lane tried to kick him out peacefully but since assholejosh was a drunken asshole,he tried to fight lane and got laid the fuck out.then my friend mario tried to help assholejosh but assholejosh swung on him.....  .................i promise this is part of the heroin sory.............  mario then kicked his ass.we finally convinced assholejosh to leave but we didnt want him to drive,so we took his keys(beacause he was very drunk).evrything was ok,then about ten minutes later assholejosh came back with a gun.  ok i know i havnt gotten to the heroin part but i really need a shower.

      last of the great hunters  pouring into another night moonless, engulfed in the sickness  in oakland and drunk  triumph, carries me on the eighty two to east oakland and  carries me proud  dope money a mammoth            a mammoth                     taken     when the tip of a ciggarette is the sun setting in the desert or rising over salt flats on a sunday morning,holy and warm ,there is an unparalelled and childlike lust for even the smallest fraction of this to be some kind of truth.truth in anything but the jagged funhouse reflection of weathered self,framed and cinged on alluminum.this is the dichotamy of heroin,smoked alone by me in a dimly lit shithole last june.back when brian bounced up from shattuck to telegraph with the black shit,before it butterflied from its cocoon in a clear plastic baggy to meet its end on a piece of tin foil or  in a spoon.                    my journey into the abyss,that is berkeley's dope scene was accompanied by two north texas junkies on their second tour of the east bay by the names of shane and lindsay.shane was a wirey half iranian half el salvadorian dope fiend with an obbsession for making role playing games.he was a great artist but his ego was bigger than his skill at this point and his addiction towered both.to give you a better idea of him ill tell a very short story: once,when i hustled some idiot out of a shitload of powdered mdma(ecstasy)and abused it to the point where i was no longer entertained, i kicked it down to shane who shot it up with speed and managed to become the only person i know to throw up while smiling. lindsay was a friend of shane's who shared his addiction and wanderlust but was sent by god to keep his ego in check.she was a wonderful and selfless creature. my roomaste at the time tried to keep the room we shared a"hangout" spot.this pissed me off because i lived in the"hangout" part of the room.the situation came to a head when everyone started shooting crack,while in the same week i was diagnosed with pnemonia.i kicked everyone the fuck out except of course for my roommate and decided to start using coke instead of smoking heroin.   before i started to use heroin,i tried to stick to just alcohol and pot,which worked for almost a year. that year was preluded with  a bunch of trips to vallejo to buy coke off a small time drug dealer who managed to charge less than anyone in my shithole town.  if you were to ask my family,friends or therapists why i started to use heroin again they would all give you separate answers.i will tell you the real story but first i have to shower
