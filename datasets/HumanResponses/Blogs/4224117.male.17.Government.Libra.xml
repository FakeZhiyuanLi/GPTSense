						   i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?

						   i was just watching apocalypse now and ive realised that napalm is your friend, your very best friend, and she will care for you- she just wants your soul first, here's how to make her:  the last time i made it, mine was very basic- 1 part gasoline to 2 parts animal blood. This solidified into a type of gel, not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore, this dries into a form of foam itself, with a wet slice at the bottom, tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn, you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away, very fast indeed, because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time, superb.
