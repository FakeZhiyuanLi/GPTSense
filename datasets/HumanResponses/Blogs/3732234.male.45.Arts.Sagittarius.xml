						                It's got to lead to  some-thing       It can't be all  up-hill       When all you have is  nothing       There's still your own  free will         &nbsp;     Never-the-less you'll go  in circles       Another time around the  wheel       Mean-ing-less is not the  answer       Such a mess is not so  real         &nbsp;     Should you cry out  ever-last-ing       Should you try and grab  the ring       Are these questions so  mis-lead-ing       That you feel you'll  never win         &nbsp;     With all your heart and  soul now       Realize a strength  with-in       A world that's  ever-change-ing       A new place to  begin         &nbsp;     You must beleive in  some-thing       Plant a seed and let it  sow       Give your thought's a  place to wonder       Give your soul a chance  to grow         &nbsp;     All the beauty that  surrounds you       And in time these things  you'll know       Like the space and time  before you       And for the earth  below         &nbsp;     Lite a candle for true  virtue       Let the light forever  glow       Cast away the things  that hurt you       And in peace you'll  always go

						               Mother nature, Father time     Rivers running, running dry     Sticks and stones, blood and bones     Majestic mountains stand alone     Hill's and valley's lay to waste     Mother nature sets her pace      &nbsp;    Stronger faster, storm clouds  build     Nothing's gonna stop her will     Not love of money, want or greed     We've come to far, to blind to see      &nbsp;    And all the while, just out of  reach     The lie's not answers, of what we  preach     Won't bring it back, what we let  go     The natural world, the one we  know

						   We have flying machines A world full of dreams Chains and gold rings Plenty of things To make us happy  We've walked on the moon Choose life all to soon Held silver spoons Plenty of things To make us Happy  We'll talk all the while See little one's smile Go that extra mile Plenty of things To make us happy  We'll stand at the gate Hating the weight Lifted...Far from our shoulders  With troubles all gone Greet a new dawn Plenty of things To make us happy

						   From the sound's that echo forward;  to words - once said atlast ,  the start of silance choosen -that leads us from the past. In written lines before you , countless worlds unfold , and voices turn to whisper as memories unfold. Its not that no one listen's, the things we say ring true, the cards were always  holding , mean more to me and you.  In moments  of true witness and time that should stand still, there's always one thing given.....the  choice, your own free will. The mountains that we're climbing , the shadows that we cast, the reasons that we're searching - will come to us at last. In hopes of  understanding and thoughts to warm your soul,the one thing to discover.....listen......and you'll know.
