      Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done? You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...

      Hey my darlings. Today was such a bad friday! I am sick as a mo fo and everyone else is partying while me and justin sat at home and watched Pimp my ride. Haha it was a banger tho...and we ate dunkaroos so that pretty much was a party anyway. www.williamhung.net is the place to be. I want to marry him. He's my little chinese chipmunk. Rachel wants him too. I was so bored today that I watched MTV Hits and noticed that they were showing the same lineup of videos just now that they were when i got home from school....i could actaully predict what the next one was going to be. Honestly.....that is sad. 1 week, 2 days till i'm un-grounded. Amazing! Oh and my family will be in VA for prom weekend so i'm thinkin prom after-party at my hizzouse! Wat up my Andreas..i miss u have fun with Ter-bear! Ahh it's time for some eyes shut. Peace out my negros!         ::At night i pray...that soon yor face will fade away:: Megzzzz

      Hey yooooo. Amanda's in florida. Not cool. I did nothing today except get some more stuff for prom and watch a couple movies. That's about the only things i can do for about a week. And Ben, I wasn't sleeping...that's not all i do! Haha, okay..so maybe i was. I think a bunch of cool people are at wendy's right now and that makes me furious because i'm missing out on that deliciousness! Dave is soo irate right now!Oh yeah, i took a bath today. I think i was in there for like an hour and it was really hot and when i got out i was steaming. But that might just be cause i'm hott. Pshhh (X to the Z Xzibit). Peeaaace.

      I stole this from Hadassah because i really like it and its true. Hehe sorry Dass but eh u know ur one of them:      to my TRUE friends:   i got ur back, i'll be there.   call me when u need me, don't hesitate to tell me.   i'll listen, i'll lie, i'll cry, i'll laugh, i'll chill, i'll drive, i'll walk, i'll run, i'll hide, i'll pay, i'll stay, i'll leave, and i'll believe.  wherever, for whatever, however, till whenever...well actually forever.

      Hey kiddos. Guess what. William Hung and Hanson should go on tour together because they are the best singers ever. HAHA no actually that new song by hanson isn't half bad ehh ehh ehh? Hmm nothing happened today cause i'm still grounded but trent and stefan stopped by for a while. We sat outside and froze our asses off in late april. How sad. That's ok....in 2 weeks it's the beach and that will be SOO amazing i can't wait! 2 words can easily sum up today: Pop rocks (consider that one word) and Foam candy (that's one word too). Both amazing things....AMAZING! It's raining in florida and that's also amazing. I heard so many stories today. Like "worm-hunting" and people walking in on their parents and poeple's moms sucking their friends dicks when their drunk....hmm. I never knew that and now i am going to look at her different. Thats wrong. But o well i'm peacin. Later yooooos

      So today i was def reallllly tired and slept the whole day. Tonight was half bad, half good. Some talk from school got back to my parents...that's not cool. I hate people who talk and gossip which is basically all of WY but o well i'll live. Hmm i'm also dreading alot of things and looking forward to alot of things. It's just a messed up time for me right now. OMG justin got in a crash today! mrs. knaub was "daydreaming" and ran a stop sign and totaled his car. But o well she has to pay for it, nigga whaaat! Haha yay! Now he can get his ride pimped fo rill. But i was really worried about him when i found out. He's my nigg. But he didn't get hurt so YAY! The O.C. tonight was amazing as usual and so were the dunkaroos i ate. My friendz Shanny and trent came by so that was cool cause none of my other friends ever visit me. Aww hell i'm just not cool enough i dont really have any friends. I'm sad. Good night

      Hello! I'm finally un-grounded, wooo! On friday night i went mini golfing with chad, kate, ben and karin. It was ok but we all sucked. Ben was suffering from major ADD so he kept vandalizing things and being mean to poor little kids. Haha. Then through the middle of the course, Kate decided she didn't want to golf anymore so we left. Yesterday i was bored off my ass until i went to Stefan's and me, him and trent watched Gladiator and got some smoky joe's. It was delicious. Russel Crowe is hott...he glad....iates. Haha! I dunno what i'm doing today but i had a bad dream that made me sad so hopefully that won't come true. Later baby

      Hmm hey you! Need a little update, eh? Friday was fun sleeping in! And me, Karin, Kate and Amanda layed out at Kate's house for a while. Kate had the radio on 80's flashback music. It was hottttt! Then Amanda made her change it so she changed it to oldies! Haha but we got back to the flashbacks which were amazing. Clouds started comin in and we decided we should go in. Good idea cuz it was a monster storm! We went to this cute lil store and got REAL cokes! Hmm...saturday was a banger..!!! Let's just say i didn't go to bed until 5 am and had to wake up at 8 to drive to phili! Hotel Stefan was a success and i am forever in love with the song Roses by outkast. Hehahe. Yeah phili was gay yesterday for my sister's stupid soccer tournament. I felt like shit and i just slept the whole time. I'm all beat up....bumps on my head and bruises on my arm. Oh yah kristi thinks she's gonna fight me. If brandon was a man he would take care of his own problems, not have his bitch fight em for him. some people deserve to burn slowly while being tortured by rats. They are 2 of those people. LATER!

       Wow tonight is the first time i have ever watched American Idol. It is SO stupid! I think the judges pick the person they're going to like before the show even starts and then they gang up on the others no matter how well they sang. Biatches. Hmm i'm really sick of english with mr. cook he is so frustrating. Nothing is ever good enough. Dammit. Another night spent doing work for that class. Nigga please! School really needs to end cuz summer is the hot shit! Ooo but prom is next friday and that shall be fun to the super mega max with justin! Uh oh i better still have the shiny tickets...! Omg my sister just lost a tooth. She is 14! Whaaat! Ahh guess the tooth fairy will come give her a whole dollar, wooo! She's cool. That's really weird. I found all my teeth under my parents sink when i was like 7. Haha, ok well i'm sick of typing think i'll go listen to some country my new fav thing! byebye love

        Today was one of the shittiest days of my life in west york. And trust me, every day is hideous. Burger king for lunch. Very delicious. 500 ketchup packets gathered by me and justin as usual. Scattered them accross white street, like usual BK business. Every time it never ceases to make me laugh, those packets popping is the most wonderful sound to my ears. Well anyway, that was fun but i suppose some lady saw this happen and followed us back to the school. Told mr. horton that I did it. Me and only me. Well i was rudely interrupted from the disco video in my guitar class, simply to be informed that i could no longer eat open lunch for the rest of the year. THATS FIIIINE! And also, if the lady takes it to the cops i could get a $300 fine for littering. Also FINE. So here i am all pissed of and getting in trouble never ceases for the day. Then i realize i have so much shit to do for english, and i have choir practice from 6-9. Incredible evening. And of course all throughout the day, because i'm weak i just break into tears cuz i cant handle shit happening all at once and maybe i miss someone? yeah. Well it's sleepy time i guess. Later bro's and ho's. I love you all....

      Hey ladies and gentlemen. Wow last night was the hershey trip and i think everyone is still sleeping right now. I finally got to sleep at 7! yay! haha and it felt sooo good after walking around all night. We waited in the line for Storm Runner for 2 hours, and i did not get to enjoy the ride because the whole time i thought ben was going to puke all over me so i was scared as shit. Hmm...some other fun things were the pirate ship Arrr, bumper cars at 3 AM, "rock music" ahahaha, and playing 4 square cuz we were sooo bored. Rachel took me home in the morning and told me some very funny stories about all the thugs that were there. Seriously, there were so many black gangstas there...and they would cut in line for every ride. But anyway, Rachel was sleeping on a bench and this big black girl came up to her and screamed in her face n woke her up! Why do they have to be so annoying. And it doesn't help that alot of our school is racist haha sooo it was funny. Anyway, i think i'll go back to sleep then i have my choir concert. Dont even think about going because its going to be hideous. Byebye! -And if you never stop when you wave goodbye, you just might find if you give it time, You just might wave hello again, you just might wave hello again. And that's the way this wheel keeps working now-

So anyway, i've been sneaking out for lunch every day and today mrs. malone saw me walk in the side door n she told the office. Well, mr. bentzel said i have a saturday detention but i can't go cuz i'm busy both saturdays we have left, so it's summer detetion for 3 hours! HAHA, hmm wonder if i'll go? I'm not going to west york next year so there is no point. Yay! I will miss 2% of the people there. U know who you are babies. Tomorrow night is prom! It's a half day of school and i have tests to take n shit. Get my hurr did and whatnot. Tonight i got my nails done. THey look pretty. Guess what?

      What can i say it was just in my head....whats up youngun's? Camping over the weekend was very long and not fun. It started to rain on monday and the campground turned into an absolute quagmire! Haha that's my dad's word and i love it. But it is a real word. Sounds like a Hillary word to me! This week is better. I put people in their places and have attempted to make things okay with others. Whether they are okay, i dont know. It's hard to tell. The most unlikely people can turn the other way suddenly, and the most unlikely can turn right back around. It's a fun game. Not really, ho's!!! I love dustin kern. He signed my yearbook so ultra-cooly. Justin is going to sleep now to dream about my cute little face.....aww how dreamy! I wish i could pack him up and take him back to washington with me. Justin, you are my bestest friend here, i love ya! Omg! the new Harry Potter movie comes out on friiiiidaaay! YAY! And hillary might not be coming cuz her mom is sick but her mom can suck it up! hehe, u better come hill, or i will flip shit! Ok i suppose its sleepy time for little girls. Good night!

      I'm so mad and frustrated and confused and just everything right now! Hillary can't come anymore cuz her mom is sick and of course something always has to ruin it. I have fucking finals tomorrow that i didn't study for because i had to write too many damn papers and do projects. I still have to do a vocal portfolio thing but hell if that will get done. And i've just been thinking about ALOT of things and i dont think it matters where i live, i'm not going to be happy anywhere. Because that's just how that goes. The only thing that can make me happy, i have fucked up so many times and it will just never happen and it makes me really mad and sad and so torn between places. And i should express my true feelings but that will just make everything so much worse. Everything is gay. If u can make me happy in any way please do it cuz i really need it right now! PEACE

        Hey you. Well i haven't written in here for a while but i'm in a much better mood now! And things are just looking up. We'll see how the summer goes, darlings. Hmm...friday i had my Alg 3 final and i know i failed it but what can ya do? It was a half day and me n Rachy went straight to the store and bought 3 packages of velveeta mac and cheese because it was my dream for the day. Went to her hizzouse and cooked it and ate it...amazing! I ate more than i should have but it's so fun to eat and nothing tastes better than mac and cheese. We also watched Goldmember and between that movie and Rachel's comments, i didn't stop laughing the whole time! She has these little Goldmember figurines and wow i can't say i hated them at all. Yesterday i just chilled all day and it was a GREAT day for little girls named Meg! :) Today i chilled too. Mostly slept because my back feels like it's broken and i felt like i was gonna puke nd pass out. Yay! Must be gettin old.... Well its dinner time for kids who sleep all day! Aloha!(aloha means hello aaand goodbye, you silly ass!)

      Hey babes. Yes i failed my Alg 3 final as i had predicted. 61% yooo. Wow, how bout an update? Tuesday was the last day of school and there was this party thing at amanda's grandma's pool. Lots of people showed up and it was fun. THere were gladiator wars, and i got pretty burnt. Wednesday i babysat allll day for 3 little children who were a handful but i'll be seeing alot of them this summer. Whitney is cute :) Ever since then i have done practically nothing. Except sit around and watch tv and movies such as Kill Bill(which sucked) and Pretty Woman. How exciting. I wish someone would give me something interesting to do! I can't enjoy the great outdoors here because....there is none. York, PA sucks....let's drive to Baltimore! *Hehe* Oh i did get my belly button pierced and it is hotttt to the double maxx and today i got a new shirt at hollister. But i think its too small! Some things dont fit inside the shirt that should, and that has never happened to me before! Muhahahaha. Well i'll be going now, buh bye.

      Heeey. The summer's been more intersting lately, so hooray. I babysit for those kids alot which means i can actually have a new wardrobe this fall for once! Let's see, Friday night me and Justin rented You Got Served. On the way back from the video store, we got served. There was this medical vehicle so he swerved out of the way and hit the right side mirror on something on the side of the road. So...the mirror part shattered and i had to hold it the whole way back to my house, where we duck taped it back on. Anway, the movie was ghettolicious. "Chatta chatta chit chit!" Haha i

      Learn how to break dance. Haha, i've always thought it would be fun and i'm pissed that guys can go and be more flexible than me. So i'll try it. Nothing exciting has been happening at all. I agree with Amanda-i have never hated anything more than this summer. (except a few certain people.) But it's true. The days are nice and sunny, but what to do and who to share them with? Nothing and no one. It's a waste! Summer detention sucked too. 3 hours of reading a book and freezing my ass off in that over-air-conditioned school of theirs. Sometimes i lay outside for 2 hours, but i dont get tan or even burnt. Whaaat! I had a cook out the other day. Usually when u have a cookout it means everyone brings stuff. But everyone just came and ate my food and then left. Except for Rachel and Justin! We watched you got served again and had a happy time. Oh well, i give up with some people. Well i better be getting on with my evening events...later.

       OK...here's what next school year will be like:   1. i'll be living with another family and yes i'm scared to death of that!   2. I'll have a car but i have to get a job and all the money i make will go to pay for my car's insurance and for gas. :(   3. I have to get a checking account?!?!   4. New legal guardians....ehhh!   5. I have to mantain a B average or else i'm back in hell.   6. Possibly have to take Civics next summer because lovely WY doesn't have that class and it's required at CV. ahhh!   7. LOTS of fun times, me n my bestest friends all together again, possibly making a film (hehehe) senior year, baby!! chaospunk and rancidpunk and our love triangle, ooh interesting! Hellz, waht else? Snowboarding on real mountains again!!! YES! camping trips, ski trips, the cabin, cliff jumping, krispy kreme, pop rocks....etc.    Sooo i am really scared about some things and really excited about the rest. Today when my parents told me that they found a family for me to stay w/ (our friends the Foulkes) and all taht stuff about paying for shit i was a little shocked. Then i thought about how its gonna be the day i leave. Whoa, no more parents, no more sister. I dunno...its scary. Sometimes i hate them but i will miss them so much especially my dad. I mean who's gonna be around to try and be ghetto and "hip"?? Well i guess Gary. But something scares me the most. Leaving one person. My bestest boy friend and the person i loved more than anything i ever have. Ahhh hopefully i'll be fiiine. It's been an interesting time here and i've met some interesting people....but some really cool ones too. Well, good night.

      Heya kids! I just got back from a long camping trip in Cape Cod, Mass. We went w/ our friends from Ohio the Churches. It was a fun trip except for the camping part. Hmm...we went to the beach the first day...we thought we'd walk a couple miles out to this lighthouse. Yeah...we got there and we were soo tired and we had no water and it was hot and we didn't have shoes on either so the sand was tearing up our feet. We took a different way back which was this sand road and it was taking forever. Then these nice people came by and they picked us up and we came to figure out that we would have been walking for a looooong time in desert-like conditions. Thanks people! Next day, went to martha's vineyard, whatever that is. It was kinda gay. Yesterday we went to Boston and that was super amazing. I loved that city!! Oh yeah there was this cool City Toilet and you put a quarter in and u go in and do your stuff then once you come out it closes and cleans itself! Its sooo awesome! And Hillary went in and she said it plays relaxing music. Hahahaha! Ok so taht is my story. The ride home took all day and i'm gonna go sleepy in my own comfortable bed now! By the way, i only have like 20 days total left in york. So u better love me whilst you can!

      Hey my darlings! My friends are so cool, Rachel is dancing in the Weird Al concert on friday night which is the most amazing thing ever, and Justin can sing kidz bop songs really good. Haha, he came over last night and we watched The Butterfly Effect (what a great movie!) BUT before all of that, we were discussing Kidz Bop and how we are so pissed that they try to sing yellowcard and blink 182 songs. They sing "i miss you" and justin was demostrating how they sing and it was the funniest moment of ever. The way he sang "Catching things and eating their insides" was astronomical. wow, what a vocabulary word. usually my vocabually consists mostly of the words "i'm sorry..." -what an upgrade. I looked at a few colleges online today. They were pretty cool. Then i looked at their standards and most of them said that they take only applicants that were in the top 15% of their high school class. I'm definately down in the loser section! POO! Embry Riddle Aeronautics university in daytona beach looks like the best bet so far. Disneyworld, manatees, the beach, hot guys, dont have to travel for spring break. Sounds good! I love Gavin DeGraw. I've been listening to his music all day and probably will continue until forever. Well i'm gonna go try to find somethin to do. byebye. ::Oh, this is the start of something good, don't you agree?::

       boo bop ba doop. OMG!! the butterfly effect has 2 different endings! (in case any of you are as clueless as i was!) I was watching it again last night with my dad, and i noticed a scene that i had never seen before. But i jsut thought i had missed it when i first watched it. THEN at the end, he like fuckin kills himself and i was like "What?! that's not the ending i saw!" I was so freaked out but then my dad told me we watched the director's cut and i felt stupid. But i like the other ending better, the one me n J watched. Not as depressing, yo! All i've been doin today is eating my house. And i looked at a few colleges in Boston, since that is the most "wicked-pissa-cool" city in the world. I dunno, its somethin they say in boston.... !Anyway! Boston University looks good to me, and a major in photojournalism or film. I kinda really wanna make a movie to one of my favorite books. Actually it would be a trilogy but no one has done it yet and hopefully they won't so i can do it! Anywhoo, i was just lookin at boston in case my flight career doesn't end up working out. It needs to be sunny again. I.WANT.MY.SUMMER.BACK. these days are just grey and blaaaaah! Last night was a bad ngiht for my family. Everyone was unhappy, except for me really. But its just, no one wants the same things and its shitty for my parents. I'm going back, they want to go back, but my sister wants to stay here like a cock-ass. I dunno i feel bad sometimes. Shouldn't families stick together? But i'm leaving them...i just dont know if its right. But i really want to. Well i hope you had a fun day anyway. Later yooos.

      Hey pimps and ho's.  I'm so proud of meself. I learned a song on the guitar today, a real song not some gay shit that they teach in guitar class. It's Let That Be Enough by Switchfoot. I dunno if any of u have heard it but its a pretty song n i wish i had an acoustic guitar to play it on. But for those of you who have ever heard me attempt to play guitar, you would be so surprised. But i seriousyl spent like all day working on it so i know i'm a loser. I gotta start packing soon.  ;(  i dont want to, too much work. And i get a car for my birthday which is August 3rd in case any of you bitches were thinking about forgetting. Now you cant. I want money! Just kidding, what i really want is a 24 karat gold necklace with rims still spinnin with diamonds on them. straight thuggin! Buti think i already got enough *bling* to satisfy me. U know..... well, justin beats me i guess. By the way, where is justin? Did the tornado get him?? He's hiding somewhere today but i'll find him. Maybe later. I really wanna go to that Weird Al concert tomorrow night and see Rachel perform her magic gangsta-styyle. Haha, gotta get to that show!! fuckin weird ass al, yeeeaaah! Ok its late and i'm just rambling so i'm going to retire. No one reads this crap anyway cuz they already know its gonna be gay! Nighty night                                                   ilovepoprocks

I got to see 7 of my 9 cousins in that family and they're awesome, i loved them. Adrienne has 3 little boys that are so cute and a girl on the way. Wow that family is huge. Then we drove here to Tyler, Texas. Today we went to this rose garden, then swimming, then to my cousin's rehearsal dinner. She's marrying a mexican named Sergio he's really nice. But anyway the mexicans did the dinner and the drink was tequila! YAYY! I had like 3 glasses but it didn't do much. My younger cousin took one down and said she couldn't feel her arms! lol. Tomorrow is the wedding and its gonna be real pretty. It's about 100 degrees here every day and really steamy but i like it. I'm not even burnt yet.... Well, i just got done working out, haha, so i'm gonna go up to the room now. Wish u were here ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; luv ya

      Heeey ya. These past few days have been fuuuun. Wednesday night i went to the olive garden with kate caffrey and her friend amanda. That was fun, they're silly silly fun girls. Then we went to sunset park and saw the whole world. There were fireworks there and all, then we all went to amanda sweet's house to sit in lawn chairs. Haha, theeeen i went over to shannon's and had some good times. 2 people trying to talk online to different people doesn't work so well. The other one always ends up saying something you would never say yourself, therefore confusing the person on the other end and making them wonder why they are friends with you! SOOO not necessary! Hmm, yesterday me, Rachel, Amanda, Kate, and Zack went to jim and nena's but i didnt eat there. Then the 3 cool ones left and me and rachel went to wendy's cuz its better. Then we got together with Karin, Kelsi, Sweet, and Kat and just drove around. Hmm hmm....today we went to breakfast at Denny's for sweet's birthday. By "we" i mean the whole world again. We got the back room yesss! Well now i really can't spend any more money! I leave for new hampshire for flying camp on Sunday, instead of Monday. Noo good. My time left in york is getting less and less and soon it will be over. There's so much time  i haven't been able to spend with certain people and it makes me really sad and depressed. I'm not a huge fan of the pot fanatics these days. Let's not forget what's really important in life, goodnight.
