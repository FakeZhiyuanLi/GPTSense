      14:55 I dare not make that phone call. It shouldn't matter, and we all agreed it wouldnt, so why have i put it off so long?  20:00 Plucked up the energy. Rang singer - no answer.

      9.37 Off again today, using up holidays. Plan for today is to get an overdraft (to stop being charged for month end) enquire about Holidays (Kavos may be off, but Malia, Laganas...) That's it. There is no more news... 17:57 Overdraft sorted - 200 squid. Holidays - need to all be there, although things have hit a slight snag. PULL YOUR FINGER OUT NEL. Dyed jacket, had lunch with Ma, ate a million biscuits, and now feel sick. How hot is it today??? 27*. Was at 28.3 before... Back to work tomorrow.

      21:42 How hot is it!!! Oh hang on i have thermo on my telephone. 26* Ok it's been up to 27*, but still is really warm today. Waiting for the storms... Spoke to Phil, last member done, just need to wait on cancelling the room and that's it, end of an era. Dentist this morning. Nearly 20 quid for a check up, but got referred for wisdom tooth. Bonus. Got to work at nearly 11, even better. Work got revenge with an afternoon of scripting (i'm not even going to begin to explain!) My back door still smells of cat pi$$. No idea where it has come from or a cure, tried scrubbing. My door is rotten anyway so perhaps it's soaked in? A new door may be the answer. Anyway, all showered ready for another day. Let's hope last nights insomnia doesn't set in. Holiday shopping Wednesday lunch.....

      23:06 Watching Lee Evans on Paramount2. Seen em all before but still funny. Just watched return of the Jedi with Nelson, i must be the worst person ever to watch a film with! "I don't get it right, why did such and such...." or "What did he just say..." are my two faves!!! I talk to much. Spoke to Karl and Steve finally. Was dreading it but they were understanding ( i hope and think) Phil was in bed, so will have to wait till tomorrow. All hopes now on the next project. Watch this space... No decorating today, but bought my cabinet for tv etc. Looks very neat and tidy!!!! Dentist in the morning. Hoping for a referal to have last 2 wisdom teeth out. OUCH...
