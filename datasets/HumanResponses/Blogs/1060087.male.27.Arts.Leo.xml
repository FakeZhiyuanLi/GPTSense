      Here's something that really stopped me.   The First Elegy   Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' hierarchies? and even if one of them pressed me suddenly against his heart: I would be consumed in that overwhelming existence. For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we still are just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. Every angel is terrifying.   And so I hold myself back and swallow the call-note of my dark sobbing. Ah, whom can we ever turn to in our need? Not angels, not humans, and already the knowing animals are aware that we are not really at home in our interpreted world. Perhaps there remains for us some tree on a hillside, which every day we can take into our vision; there remains for us yesterday's street and the loyalty of a habit so much at ease when it stayed with us that it moved in and never left.   Oh and night: there is night, when a wind full of infinite space gnaws at our faces. Whom would it not remain for--that longed-after, mildly disillusioning presence, which the solitary heart so painfully meets. Is it any less difficult for lovers? But they keep on using each other to hide their own fate.   Don't you know yet? Fling the emptiness out of your arms into the spaces we breathe; perhaps the birds will feel the expanded air with more passionate flying.  Yes--the springtimes needed you. Often a star was waiting for you to notice it. A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past, or as you walked under an open window, a violin yielded itself to your hearing. All this was mission. But could you accomplish it? Weren't you always distracted by expectation, as if every event announced a beloved? (Where can you find a place to keep her, with all the huge strange thoughts inside you going and coming and often staying all night.)  But when you feel longing, sing of women in love; for their famous passion is still not immortal. Sing of women abandoned and desolate (you envy them, almost) who could love so much more purely than those who were gratified. Begin again and again the never-attainable praising; remember: the hero lives on; even his downfall was merely a pretext for achieving his final birth. But Nature, spent and exhausted, takes lovers back into herself, as if there were not enough strength to create them a second time. Have you imagined Gaspara Stampa intensely enough so that any girl deserted by her beloved might be inspired by that fierce example of soaring, objectless love and might say to herself, "Perhaps I can be like her"? Shouldn't this most ancient of sufferings finally grow more fruitful for us? Isn't it time that we lovingly freed ourselves from the beloved and, quivering, endured: as the arrow endures the bowstring's tension, so that gathered in the snap of release it can be more than itself. For there is no place where we can remain.  Voices. Voices. Listen, my heart, as only saints have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them off the ground; yet they kept on, impossibly, kneeling and didn't notice at all: so complete was their listening. Not that you could endure  God's  voice--far from it. But listen to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message that forms itself out of silence. It is murmuring toward you now from those who died young. Didn't their fate, whenever you stepped into a church in Naples or Rome, quietly come to address you? Or high up, some eulogy entrusted you with a mission, as, last year, on the plaque in Santa Maria Formosa. What they want of me is that I gently remove the appearance of injustice about their death--which at times slightly hinders their souls from proceeding onward.  Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer, to give up customs one barely had time to learn, not to see roses and other promising Things in terms of a human future; no longer to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands; to leave even one's own first name behind, forgetting it as easily as a child abandons a broken toy. Strange to no longer desire one's desires. Strange to see meanings that clung together once, floating away in every direction. And being dead is hard work and full of retrieval before one can gradually feel a trace of eternity.-- Though the living are wrong to believe in the too-sharp distinctions which they themselves have created. Angels (they say) don't know whether it is the living they are moving among, or the dead. The eternal torrent whirls all ages along in it, through both realms forever, and their voices are drowned out in its thunderous roar.  In the end, those who were carried off early no longer need us: they are weaned from earth's sorrows and joys, as gently as children outgrow the soft breasts of their mothers. But we, who do need such great mysteries, we for whom grief is so often the source of our spirit's growth--: could we exist without  them ? Is the legend meaningless that tells how, in the lament for Linus, the daring first notes of song pierced through the barren numbness; and then in the startled space which a youth as lovely as a god had suddenly left forever, the Void felt for the first time that harmony which now enraptures and comforts and helps us.   Rainer Maria Rilke trans. Stephen Mitchell

      T. S. Eliot   S`io credesse che mia risposta fosse  A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,  Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.  Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo  Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,  Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.    Let us go then, you and I,  When the evening is spread out against the sky  Like a patient etherized upon a table;  Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,  The muttering retreats  Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels  And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells  Streets that follow like a tedious argument  Of insidious intent  To lead you to an overwhelming question...  Oh, do not ask, "What is it?''  Let us go and make our visit.   In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.   The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes  The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes  Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening.  Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains.  Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys.  Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,  And seeing that it was a soft October night,  Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.   And indeed there will be time  For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,  Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;  There will be time, there will be time  To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;  There will be time to murder and create,  And time for all the works and days of hands  That lift and drop a question on your plate;  Time for you and time for me.  And time yet for a hundred indecisions,  And for a hundred visions and revisions,  Before the taking of a toast and tea.   In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.   And indeed there will be time  To wonder, "Do I dare?'' and, "Do I dare?''  Time to turn back and descend the stair,  With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--  [They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!'']  My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,  My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--  [They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!'']  Do I dare  Disturb the universe?  In a minute there is time  For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.   For I have known them all already, known them all:  Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,  I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;  I know the voices dying with a dying fall  Beneath the music from a farther room.          So how should I presume?   And I have known the eyes already, known them all--  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,  And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,  When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,  Then how should I begin  To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?          And how should I presume?   And I have known the arms already, known them all--  Arms that are braceleted and white and bare  [But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]  Is it perfume from a dress  That makes me so digress?  Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.          And should I then presume?          And how should I begin?                                .   .   .   .   .  Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes  Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? . . .   I should have been a pair of ragged claws  Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.                                .   .   .   .   .  And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!  Smoothed by long fingers,  Asleep. . . tired . . . or it malingers,  Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.  Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?  But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,  Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,  I am no prophet--and here's no great matter;  I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,  And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,  And in short, I was afraid.   And would it have been worth it, after all,  After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,  Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,  Woud it have been worth while,  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,  To have squeezed the universe into a ball  To roll it toward some overwhelming question,  To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,  Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all''--  If one, settling a pillow by her head,          Should say: "That is not what I meant at all.          That is not it, at all.''   And would it have been worth it, after all,  Would it have been worth while,  After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,  After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor--  And this, and so much more?--  It is impossible to say just what I mean!  But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:  Would it have been worth while  If one, settling a pillow, or throwing off a shawl,  And turning toward the window, should say:          "That is not it at all,          That is not what I meant, at all.''                                .   .   .   .   .  No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  Am an attendant lord, one that will do  To swell a progress, start a scene or two,  Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,  Deferential, glad to be of use,  Politic, cautious, and meticulous;  Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;  At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--  Almost, at times, the Fool.   I grow old . . . I grow old . . .  I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.   Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?  I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.  I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.    I do not think that they will sing to me.   I have seen them riding seaward on the waves  Combing the white hair of the waves blown back  When the wind blows the water white and black.   We have lingered in the chambers of the sea  By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

      by Paul Celan  Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown  we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night  we drink it and we drink it  we dig a grave in the clouds there one lies unconfined  A man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writes  he writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margarete  he writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are all flashing he whistles his dogs out  he whistles his Jews out in earth has them dig for a grave  he commands us strike up for the dance    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink in the morning at noon we drink you at sundown  we drink you and we drink you  A man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writes  he writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair Shulamith we dig a grave in the skies there one lies unconfined    He calls out jab deeper into the earth you lot you others sing now and play  he grabs at the iron in his belt he waves it his eyes are blue  jab deeper you lot with your spades you others play on for the dance    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink you at noon in the morning we drink you at sundown  we drink and we drink you  a man lives in the house your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair Shulamith he plays with the serpents  He calls out more sweetly play death death is the master from Deutschland  he calls out more darkly now stroke your strings then as smoke you will rise into air  then a grave you will have in the clouds there one lies unconfined    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink you at noon death is a master from Germany  we drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink you  death is a master from Deutschland his eyes are blue  he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true  a man lives in the house your golden hair Margarete  he sets his pack on to us he grants us a grave in the air  he plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master from Germany  your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair Shulamith

      So, on this great day of BBQing, I was wondering if anyone had any good recipes for stuff to put on the grill.  I mean besides the normal hot dog or hamburger, of course.  Anyone do anything especially delicious out there?

      Excerpt from my Statement of Purpose for grad school....  I have been excited to see poetry increase its engagement of society through different vehicles such as performance poetry, Poetry in Motion, and Robert Pinsky’s Favorite Poem Project.  The poet’s job is not just to write poetry, but to bring poetry to the attention of society--not just for the sake of furthering poetry itself, but to bring attention to that which poetry addresses.  Whether the misfortunes of others or the enjoyment of the beautiful, poetry tells us we are not alone, there are more perspectives than our own, we are not always right, and we are not always wrong.  This engagement of society is especially important during present times, where we are bombarded by images of war and yet rushed through the hustle and bustle of life.  It is easy to go through life without really thinking.  It is the job of the poet, as all artists, to cause people to stop and think.

      Being with Sharon as she graduates and faces life after undergrad has made me start to think a lot about how other people live from day to day. I don't know how I would survive if it weren't for my goals of becoming a professor.  Getting into grad school, writing, and publishing has taken so much of my focus that it's really gotten me through many otherwise tediously boring days.  I'd be such a victim of the daily grind if I didn't have something tangible to strive for.   I realize that a lot of other people I know have church...and get engrossed in church because it gives a sense of meaning and fulfillment that their jobs just don't provide.  I try to imagine being in business or being a consultant...and it seems so drab and boring.  I hate the days when I'm busy doing tons of things and yet come out realizing that I didn't spend any time doing anything that I really cared about.  It's such a suffocating feeling...it's just slaving away, living for your next moment of freedom.   It's no wonder that so many people live for the weekends or live for fun.  I can see why people go out a lot and try to regain their sanity by drinking or clubbing.   I suppose I'm too selfish for that.   I hate it when I go out and try to do something for fun...and after it's over I feel like I've wasted my time.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's important to enjoy life.  And I enjoy having fun.  Often times fun things aren't a waste of time.  But I'm realizing, once again, that there are those times that you just feel like it was such a waste...and I really really hate that feeling.   It makes me glad that I have goals and a sense of purpose.   Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?

      So I've started to submit poems to journals for  publication.&nbsp; And already started to get rejection letters back.&nbsp; It's interesting...the excitement is no longer in seeing if my poems get accepted or  not...most of the excitement, as I rip open the envelope, is in trying to guess  which publication the rejection letter is from.  In any case, it's good to be getting back on track with things.  I've also been reading voraciously.&nbsp; I've been  successfully striving to read at least three books a week.&nbsp; I think a lot  of the drive came from the realization that if most of my time in any given week  is devoted to my day job, then all I really am is an Administrative  Assistant.&nbsp; So long as I devote my main work efforts to poetry...that's  what allows me to say guiltlessly that I'm a poet  Anyone know of any part time job  opportunities?

      I was looking back at the history that passed me by, reading Best American Poetry 1995, and it seemed that many poems fell apart at their ends.  It's as if the poets didn't really trust their readers, feeling the message of the poems were too important to leave up to the reader to deduce.  I was reminded of a discussion in my poetry group about erudite poems or poems that are, for whatever reason, difficult to decipher.  There's this impetus to be in control.  When people read, they want to come out of the experience in possession of meaning.  Most people don't want to be a mere survivor of the experience.  The book can capture their attention and--like a movie--be an escape for some time, but in the end, most people want to come out of the experience as the master...master over the plot, the narrative, the word.  Who wants to take the chance on poetry? There's so much in poetry that can cause the reader to risk being conquered--to struggle for an hour, or days, or months, and to come to an end having to give up the attempt to conquer.  Most people can't fathom or digest the fact that words could actually prove more powerful than us.  When faced with this, we write it off..."Great tone, but it is unclear what you are trying to say.  Is there a point to this work? You paint a great picture, but the connections between the parts need to be elucidated.  This work is self-masturbatory."  Art isn't always meant to be grasped.  Like life, it isn't conquerable though you can fool yourself into thinking it is.  Is it masochistic to be wanted to taken hold by a work and be tossed around for a ride...to come out gasping and mumbling to yourself, What the hell just happened? Perhaps, but when I watch a movie, I don't want to be preached to...I want to experience something that will grow me or move something inside me...perhaps in a way I can't explain.  Life is experience.  After years, things aren't the way you thought they'd be.  You can't say you've "won"...as if there were something to be won. Life is about living, not conquering. After years you come out and find yourself somewhere you look around and say you're here. You take away what you take away. You realize you've changed and move on.

      For the last day and a half, our company had phone  problems.&nbsp; A phone technician came in today...this Chinese guy with a thick  accent.&nbsp; Our assistant to the CEO was having a very hard time understanding  anything he was saying, so I translated...and it reminded me of how my  experiences have honed my skills in understanding broken English.  It makes me think about what it would be like if I were fluent  in Korean.&nbsp; Chances are, fluency in Korean would have greatly decreased the  number of times I was in situations where I had to decipher broken  English.&nbsp; I wonder if that would have left me as clueless as my co-worker.  And I also wonder if somehow, my heightened ability to  understand broken English and body language will help me to communicate with  more people than if I were fluent in Korean...since I can&nbsp;understand all  broken English...not just Korean broken English...it could just go a long way.

      I got into the elevator at work yesterday...thinking to myself...and I had a conversation (in my head) with the woman in the elevator.  And I was thinking how I would feel if I told her, "Good morning," and she responded, "What's so good about it?" So I just thought to myself, Well, for one thing I'm still alive. And we can walk around outside and not worry too much about getting shot on the street. And we're lucky to not be starving. To have clothing and shoes that don't have holes in them.  The thought of shoes with holes...reminded me of my mom.  I don't know if she ever told me a story about shoes with holes...but I do imagine she did.  That's one good thing about technology and globalization.  We can appreciate how lucky and blessed we really are in this country...and even within our country.  Of course, we usually don't...and well, I guess that's only human.

      You know you're socially inept when:   1. Someone makes a comment and you know you could come back with a witty response, but all you can think is, I should say something...something....  Instead you laugh.  This occurs regularly.   2. When trying to explain something, you can never manage to finish a complete sentence.  "Well it's like...I mean...that is...but then...I uh...oh...uh...."  This happens even when speaking to people you don't have a crush on.   3. People never sit down to talk to you during your lunch break. Or people sit down around you and talk to everyone else besides you during your lunch break.   4. The most people ever comment about your clothing is that they are colorful.   5. When you finally think of something to say in a group, you effectively bring the conversation to a halt with the fewest words possible.  This is why people don't talk to you.   6. After you tell a joke, no one ever laughs.  Or people laugh, but are actually laughing at you.   7. People scare you.   8. All the people you seem to click with share these traits with you.   9. When in a social situation, you often lose track of what you are doing and what you were talking about.    I can't remember if I had a point.

      You know you're hungry when the first thing you think about when you wake up is dinner. I think I'll have fried chicken for lunch. Maybe something involving beef for dinner. Or fish. Or chips. Or pancakes. Or waffles.  Right now, I'm stuck eating a granola bar.
