        From Seth Godin's BLOG:  We buy into whatever makes us feel good...no matter how illogical it is...    You can get a perfectly good cell phone for free. So why are people paying $400 or more for fancy SONY Ericsson bluetooth phones?  For the free car. (sorry, I can't display the picture)   Bluetooth™ Remote Control Car CAR-100    You are what you drive. And the CAR-100 Bluetooth™ Car Kit is an impressive statement. In addition it's also an incredibly fun gadget. Use your Sony Ericsson Bluetooth™ mobile phone to charge and control the CAR-100 and you'll have hours of fun.     Of course, it's not really free.  People (yes, even rational adults) buy things because of the way they make us feel, not because of what they do. Think about that the next time you try to add a new product feature or choose a vice presidential candidate.

       Research Home runs : Sara Evans "Suds in the Bucket" and Rachel Proctor's "Me and Emily"...   Research Dogs:  Jimmy Buffett: "Hey Good Lookin'" and Big & Rich "Save a Horse-Ride A Cowboy"...(both show huge negatives and excessive burn scores in spite of less than 9 weeks of exposure)  Big & Rich started out promising...but faded quickly. Buffett usually does well with anything in South Florida. This was burned out even before it was released...so, it shouldn't surprise anyone how poorly it's doing in callout. Hope the new CD has a few fun options for country radio.  "Redneck Woman" has "tired of" scores pushing 20 here...another quick up and quick down song. Sure made a lot of noise for a few weeks!   John Michael Montgomery's "Letter's from Home" is a bonafide hit. Not ONE bad call-out performance here during its life cycle. Now in "stay-current"...but acting like a real song.   How about you? Seeing any surprises?

        Interesting insight from Seth Godin (author of "The Purple Cow"...)    Last week, the family went to see a Broadway musical.  As occasionally happens, the star didn't show up. An understudy took his place, and there was a slip of paper in the Playbill informing the audience that the second string star would be appearing.  The lights went down, the orchestra started, the curtain went up. A few extras wandered onto the stage. Then the main character appeared.  The audience applauded.  Why?  Why was the audience applauding for the understudy? Virtually everyone in the audience knew that the big star wasn't there.  I'm sure that in the old days, when Gene Kelly or Audrey Hepburn appeared on stage, there was the gasp of recognition and the gratitude the audience felt that a big star had chosen to spend his or her valuable time with us, the audience. So the applause is a natural byproduct of that emotion.  Here, though, was an actor we hadn't paid to see, an actor who was sure to do his best, but he hadn't done a thing for us.  So why applaud?  Tradition!  There are too many choices in our lives. Too many brands of soft drink, too many kinds of cell phones, too many ways to fly from New York to LA. There are too many social choices as well--when to clap, how to say hello, what sort of message to leave on your cell phone.  As a result, more often than not, we resort to tradition. We do what we've always done because it's safer and easier.  You should care about this.  You should care if you're marketing an idea or a product that requires people to upset an existing tradition. Changing the way we do things (whether it's the design of a bicycle or the structure of the Electoral College) is hard indeed. Realizing that being better is not NEARLY enough helps you understand the magnitude of your marketing challenge. In fact, traditions rarely change quickly just because the alternatives are better. (true story: Walking down Newbury Street in Boston on Friday, less than a block from no less than 20 great and cheap restaurants, I heard one tourist say to another tourist: "Well, we could have lunch at Burger King." Why? Tradition!)  You should also care if you're trying to build something big and important. Because big and important things often come from changing the tradition. And if you can invent a new tradition, a new tradition around your innovation, that's when you win big time.  L'chaim.

        There's been a lot of heated discussion regarding the benefits of the forthcoming change to the Arbitron People Meter in the near future days...Here are some thoughts from Mark Ramsey's Marketing Nexus Blog regarding the "devil we know" versus the "devil we don't"...        Portable People Meter Fear and Loathing   Arbitron demonstrated some ways Radio Programmers can use data from their Portable People Meters (PPM's) during last week's Radio & Records convention, and some of their conclusions are destined to open a Pandora's box of trouble.  I heard about this second-hand, but I was told they were demonstrating how you could actually measure the drop-off in audience when an extraordinarily long song is played (e.g., Stairway to Heaven). You can also measure the loss when a new and unfamiliar song is played - and chart how listenership grows for such songs as familiarity grows. This way, they suggest, you can use PPM's as a form of new music research.  All very interesting, but I'm wondering a couple things:  1. When Arbitron's diaries can't accurately show how many people in total even listen to a given station from one month to the next, why should we place any credence in the ability of their PPM's to predict listenership accurately one minute to the next?  2. Doesn't the result about long songs suggest we should play the shortest possible songs only? Is this, in the long run, really going to give listeners what they want?  3. Doesn't the result about new music suggest not only that we can measure when a new song is familiar enough - but that we're actually best off by not playing ANY new songs? Again, is this really going to give listeners what they want?  Using the PPM the way Arbitron has suggested may suit their lobbying efforts - it may be sexy and persuasive - but it's a reductionist view of the listening experience that will do our brands no good in the long run.  In that long run, imperfection and genius go hand in hand. And one does not exist without the other.    Here's his follow-up BLOG posting...    I'm all for People Meters as a ratings tool. Especially compared to the antiquated and clunky diary. Yeah, the winners and losers will be different, but that's a topic for a different article. Here I want to tackle something less discussed but just as important: Arbitron's argument that the PPM can help you make minute-by-minute programming decisions.   The Logic Goes Like This...   PPM's offer minute-by-minute feedback on who's listening to what. When you overlay what a station plays on who starts, stops, and stays listening, you get a good view of what songs and other station elements are, in Arbitron lingo, "sticky." That is, what programming content is good and what's bad.   Let's assume there's enough sample to make programming conclusions - which I doubt there is. After all, in Arbitron's Philadelphia test there were 789 average daily panelists being surveyed. Even if they're all listening at once to any of Philly's 26 above-the-line stations, that's only about 30 persons per station. And since there are lots of reasons people will tune in and out besides what the station does to provoke it, how much reliability does this data really have? But let's assume it's completely reliable. Then why shouldn't you use it to program by?   Great Radio isn't Minute-by-Minute   Great and successful Radio stations - in fact, all great and successful media brands - are much more than the sum total of every minute of programming. They are emotional relationships with the audience forged over time. To paraphrase Saatchi & Saatchi CEO Kevin Roberts, using PPM as a programming aid will give you a station that relies on the accumulation of past experiences rather than the potential of future ones.   Arbitron's data shows that shorter songs have less tune-out than longer ones and more familiar songs less tune-out than new ones. Taken to its not at all laughable extreme, the programming implication is to play only familiar, short songs. Never anything new - and certainly never Stairway to Heaven. It's hard to imagine such a strategy creating compelling radio, but it's easy to imagine it creating least-objectionable radio. But is that why listeners tune in KROQ? Is that why they sample Howard Stern? Abusing research to round off every edge will pave the road to mediocrity. Commodities love company.   For Proof, Look to TV   One of the funniest shows on TV is BBC's Golden Globe winner, "The Office." Recently, the forthcoming American version received NBC's lowest test scores for any comedy series EVER. But what's flawed, the show or the system? Anyone who watches new Fall shows come and go by the schedule-load knows the answer to that one.   A great morning show or a great radio station is an alchemy of magic moments constructed from the raw materials of "genius" and "just okay." Getting the former requires some of the latter. Every minute of the Sopranos isn't great, but the show itself is. Every second on KROQ isn't great, but the station itself is. When you obsess on minute-by-minute feedback you're substituting science for art and mistaking the trees for the forest. As the philosopher said, "Be careful lest in casting out your devils that you cast out the best thing that's in you."

        Seth Godin's observation on how people are influenced by powerful marketing...    Today at the supermarket, a woman asked me to reach up to a high shelf to grab her a one ounce bag of Atkins brands crunchy chips. Probably $2 a bag, which works out to $32 a pound.  She looked at the bag, saw the label on the front that said, "Only 5 carbs" and then asked me to put it back.  She apologized, and said that her limit was 4.  Wow.  Here's a person who didn't even know what a carbohydrate was six months ago who has been so swayed by the Atkins idea that she's now too puritanical to even eat the Atkins-branded products.  This didn't happen because of advertising. It happened because of the power of the idea.

        Here's another No-Nonsense Marketing Smart Tip from Mark Ramsey. Note the point at the end about utilizing e-mail and Instant Messaging capabilities by the radio station talent...    At the Radio and Records convention today, Mercury and Point to Point Direct Marketing present the results of a research study aimed at showing you how to spend your marketing dollars more effectively. This is an ALL NEW sequel to the project we did last year, and many of the results will surprise you. For the full report, visit the Mercury website and download it for free. Here are a few headlines:   Outdoor is the Best Advertising Vehicle for Creating Trial   Got news? Trying to win new Cume? Before plunking down your hard-earned cash on a TV campaign try flooding the market with outdoor. Nearly 40% of radio listeners who recall seeing radio outdoor say they tried a station because of it. That beats telemarketing, TV, and Direct Mail by a wide margin.   If TSL is your goal, then Direct Mail is still the most powerful way to get listeners tuning in longer.   The Kinds of Direct Mail and Contests that Work Best   Listeners are most likely to open and look over a CD, a box, or a big color postcard. And the content that most appeals to them includes: A list of big events in town, fantasy-fulfillment contests, Coupons/special offers, and a contest with a big-money prize. Also, note cards or greeting cards test VERY well among Women - and very poorly among Men.   If you don't encourage online signup for contests, you're making a big mistake - more than 50% of respondents would prefer to register for contests this way. Meanwhile SECRET contests are more compelling than PUBLIC ones.   What about Frequent Listener Clubs and New Media?   20% of Radio listeners have signed up for a station Frequent Listener club. What will most induce listeners to join the club? A free CD with the year's top hits, points for listening which can be redeemed for prizes, and station logo merchandise.   Meanwhile you can dispel the myth that most listeners are technologically backward. More than 60% of listeners and nearly 70% of "likely diarykeepers" use e-mail often. About 20% use instant messaging and 10% use text messaging. But note: 18-24's are two to three times more likely to use IM and TM than the average listener. Have you tapped into your audience via these new media yet? What are you waiting for?

        From Randy Lane's Website...some good tips and reminders on how to improve station talent performance at outside appearances...and if you're like us, you're doing plenty of them...    Ladies and gentlemen, it’s Star Time—time for you to get out of the studio and into the public to mingle with the people, press the flesh, and let your listeners put the name and the face together with the voice. Promotions and events are a huge opportunity for you to make new fans and to solidify relationships with old fans and clients. They’re a huge responsibility too because you ARE the radio station when you appear in public. The entire brand is on your shoulders and it’s up to you to put on a great show and fulfill expectations.  There is a system to staging a successful promotion. We’re going to talk about how to prepare ahead of time, what to wear, take with you, how to act, what to say, what not to say or do, how to work the crowd, how to work the client, how to manage problems, and how to make your exit.  • How to prepare ahead of time. First you need a checklist. Have someone make up a template. Use it and make sure everyone who is scheduled for this event has a copy of the checklist. Include the journalism of who, what, when, where, why, plus any special instructions anybody needs to know.    What is this—a programming promotion, a live concert, a client event?      Why are we doing this? What is the purpose/goal of this promotion?     Is there a client to schmooze?      When is it—the date and exact start and end times. Include required arrival time if different from the event start time.    Where is it—the exact location with clear driving directions from the station.      Who goes from the station (talent, promotion, programming, sales, engineering, interns). And who is the primary contact on site? Who is the backup? Get names and numbers.      What is being done to make the station and the talent look BIG? Success is much greater if the station’s presence and the talent look like stars. Are there big banners with the station/talent name? Is there entertainment support for the talent (girls in bikinis, fans of the show, stanchions to square off the area where the event is to take place)?   A  Add any special instructions: Remember to take the giveaway guitar, take the BIG banner, etc. Is there a PA system for the event? (Even in scenarios where no PA is needed to be heard, most talent will feel more comfortable with a microphone in hand. It establishes their role.  All persons should meet before the appearance begins. This meeting can be in the car right outside the client’s location 15 minutes before or in the conference room a day or two before, but it needs to happen.  • What to wear. This depends on the station’s format, on what your audience looks like, and to some extent on the venue. If you are manning a booth or table, you can be a little more casual. Wear cool station gear if you have it. If it’s a concert, put on more flash because you want to be seen all the way in the last row. Better to dress up than dress down. And whatever you wear, make it clean—laundry-wise as well as PG-13.  • What to take with you. You need a central location for all the stuff that you normally take to remotes or onsite events. Let’s call it a “Go Box.” Before you head out, open the Go Box and make sure it contains the following stuff:    Your event checklist   Duct tape (you can’t be in the music business without it)   Bumper stickers, buttons, flyers, whatever free station goods you usually distribute or special goods you need for this particular event. Take more stuff than you need—you can always bring back what you don’t use.   Business cards if you have them   A fully charged cell phone (yours or the station’s) loaded with all important contact names   Extra pens (ink and big Sharpie) and a notebook or legal pad   Bottled water   Gas, a map, a credit card, and cash.   Camera   DAT or minidisc recorder  • How to act. Arrive early and stay late. Be on your best professional behavior. We do promotions to get votes, to cement important relationships, to increase the love. You are a rock and roll politician and your job is to shake hands and kiss babies. No drugs, no alcohol, nothing that momma wouldn’t be proud of.  • What to say, what not to say. You are a representative of the station. If you have any issues about station policy or format or anything at all, an event or promotion is not the place to air them. In public we put on a united front. Same goes for competition. No bad mouth, only good mouth. We do our fighting behind the scenes.  • How to work the crowd. Don’t stay in one spot and wait for people to come to you, move through the crowd and greet as many people as possible. Touch them, smile, thank them for listening to the station, and tell them we couldn’t do what we do without their support. THIS IS THE TRUTH. Don’t let any one fan monopolize your time, and should you encounter a listener with a negative attitude, don’t let that person make you lose focus. Be polite, move on and quickly adjust. Remember, he’s in the minority.  • Good beginnings. It’s a good idea if there can be some sort of icebreaker that makes it easy and natural for air talent to engage visitors when they arrive. This can be a prize wheel, a door prize drawing or a fun contest in the store the talent can direct visitors to when they enter.  • How to work the client. When you first get to the site, immediately find your contact and tell them you’ve arrived. If the contact is the client, spend an extra minute and put some star power on him. Let him know just how much you and the radio station appreciate his support. Bring him a little extra something from the station—tickets, CD’s, whatever you have. It’s so easy to go that one extra step and the impression you make can be so valuable.  • Take pictures and get sound to use on the air. In this day and age of cheap photography, have a digital camera to take pictures of the talent with fans and FAN’S KIDS. Grad email addresses and send them a copy. It’s another thing that can be done cheaply, and flashing cameras make it look like a lot is happening. Take a DAT recorder or similar device with you to tape sound you might want to use on the air the next day.  • What to do when things go wrong. When things go wrong, which they will from time to time, you have to improvise and fix them. You can’t say, “That’s not my job” if the promotion assistant runs late or his car won’t start. The show must go on, and YOU may have to run everything yourself. Know how to do that? Now you remember why you packed the cell phone...  • How to make your exit. Find the primary contact and thank them again for the opportunity to work with them on this event. Unless you’re excused by your colleagues, do your part and participate in the load-out. Run the check list in reverse, making sure you have everything you came with minus the stuff you gave away. Be sure to make a mental note of the highlights of the promotion so you can share them with the PD when you get back to the station.  We’ll close with this is important point: when you appear at a station event, you are the radio station. You are the General Manager, the Program Director, the Marketing Director and the CEO all rolled into one. Be sure to act like it. We’re counting on you to be a pro. Thanks for all your hard work.

        Here's another No-Nonsense Marketing Smart Tip from Mark Ramsey.  We talk about the importance of P1s...but nobody took the time to explain to programmers that your P1's are NOT "static"...they're always changing-ever evolving.  So should your approach in making them happy!    By definition, a P1 prefers our station more than any other. P1s are, more often than not, "fans." And we believe that even if Arbitron randomly swings south, our true "fan" count remains roughly the same. Our P1's, we believe, are the only folks we can count on. That belief is wrong. And you are going to be shocked to discover the truth.   P1s Migrate  On occasion, I have conducted studies across time for the same group of listeners. That way you can monitor not just how many P1s a station has - but are they the SAME people or not over time. Guess what? Not only are they NOT the same people, they're not even CLOSE to the same people. It turns out our P1s are anything but static. A radio station is an audience reservioir - some P1s drain out as others pour in. And what happens to your ratings depends on which direction is flowing faster.   In one recent large-market study, for example, only 52% of the average station's P1 audience was retained for six months. Only 52%! Yet the overall P1 figures were unchanged. That means nearly half the P1s are ALL NEW PEOPLE after only six months!   P1s are Gypsies   P1s, it turns out, flow through a station like air through a room with open windows. One gust replaces the next. In other words, P1s aren't residents of your audience, they're gypsies. They come and they go.   This reminds us how important it is to prospect, nurture, nourish, and grow P1s all the time. It reminds us why word-of-mouth and marketing are so important. It explains why numbers rise after a strong direct mail campaign and fall a few months later (you have temporarily altered the P1 flow). It explains why an all-P1 music test is a scary proposition (up to half those respondents wouldn't qualify just six months later).   What have you done to grow Fans?   If we view our P1s as an immobile asset, if we take a "where else will they go?" attitude, we're being naive. P1 listeners not only can but DO go - anywhere and everywhere.   Our bias should not be on defending P1s - nor should it be on "growing Cume." The most effective strategic approach is to GROW FANS, to nurture new P1s. Pure and simple. The only way your numbers will rise is if P1 migration works in your favor. Fix the "flow." Grow a fan today.

        Mike McVay recently summarized Seth Godin's "Free Prize Inside" concept on his website.  This is by far, the BEST description and explanation of the concept I've found...     Seth Godin has a new book out titled Free Prize. Bob Craig, Jr. (Bob heads up McVayMedia.com) shared it with me. Bob is a marketing man. He understands marketing, new media, and “why” today’s consumer wants something more than what they paid for. They want a “Free Prize”, too.   What is the Free Prize?  It’s the peace of mind that I get from my heart doctor.  It’s exceeding your sales goals because your ratings went up and you can sell at a higher rate.  The Free Prize is the special benefit you get, when what you (paid for or wanted, etc.) is (item purchased).    Example: I bought a Lazy Boy recliner, but what I received was the refreshed feeling I get from 30 minutes of vibrating relaxation. That was my “free prize” from Lazy Boy. It’s the feeling I get when people see me in my classic car. I bought it as a collector’s item, but everyone who sees me in it waves, gestures and comments. They make me feel good.   When it comes to Mcvay Media, I have challenged our consultants to consider what the Free Prize is that we give to our clients. The free prize is making more sales numbers when what you paid us for was improved ratings! You hire us to consult your programming in order to increase your ratings, but the free prize is “the comfort that an expert is watching you.”  It’s the roadmap that we give you.  What is the Free Prize?  The Free Prize is the experience of service at the Ritz Carlton, when what you paid for was a goodnight’s sleep.  The free Prize is the change counting machine at Commerce Bank, when what you needed was a checking account.  The Free Prize is the line at Al Yaganeh’s soup stand, when what you came for was the soup.  The Free Prize is the milk carton that housed the first 10,000 copies of Purple Cow.  The Free Prize is the way you feel when you open the little blue box from Tiffany’s.  The Free Prize is in the look on the face of the valet when you drive up in a Hummer.  The Free Prize in the lighting and ceiling of the new Boeing 77e.  The Free Prize is the lighted keyboard on the new Mac PowerBooks.  The Free Prize is the way it smells inside a bakery  The Free Prizes in the line to get onto Space Mountain  ·    The Free Prize is the container that Method dish soap comes in.  The Free Prize is the exterior design of the Maytag Neptune dishwasher.  The Free Prize is the “thunk” that the relays make when you turn on the Mark Levinson amplifier (which costs $4,000).  The Free Prize is the way you can pack cigarettes against the side of the package before you smoke them.  And what is the Free Prize at your radio station?  It’s a question worth asking the entire staff. What’s the free prize that you, as the employer, get from having hired your employee?  Maybe the folks at Cracker Jack knew what they were doing when they put the prize in the box.

        Here's a recent post by Anita Sharpe on Passionate Work (re-posted from Brandautopsy)     I don't think I fully got the true meaning of excellence until I observed something in my son.  For years, I thought he had the potential to be a great baseball player. He once hit a home run as first-grader; he once made a seemingly impossible, game-winning catch in outfield that caused his teammates to mob the field. So I silently fumed as coaches repeatedly rotated him from outfield to third base and placed him seventh or so in the batting order. All that potential, I thought, failing to be encouraged.  Nevermind that my kid also was the one most likely to be tossing his glove in the air or staring at the clouds. And nevermind that, left to his own devices, he never picked up a glove or bat to practice. His lack of passion for the game came through to everyone from other kids to coaches to parents -- everyone but me, who continued to focus on any glimmers of talent and potential.  Then when he was nine, he got a guitar. No one ever had to ask him to practice; he was at it at least two hours a day. He saved his money to buy music books. Within a year, he was ripping through Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Led Zepplin, Santana and playing on stage with a band.   And just like his fellow Little Leaguers who didn't want a semi-interested player at first base or batting clean-up, my son got quite picky about who he wanted to play music with. Casual players with talent but minimal zeal weren't welcome, even if there was a friendship cost.   And it hit me: while there is certainly no excellence without talent, it's over-the-top enthusiasm that makes the real difference. True excellence fueled by passion doesn't have to be outwardly encouraged, even in children. It doesn't require "motivation" -- at least as we commonly practice it.  True excellence is about finding that one thing that you do well and want to do many hours a day, even when the field is muddy or your fingers bleed.

      This is a post from Seth Godin's popular weblog, titled:  The Curse of Great Expectations.   I can benchmark everything now.  I can benchmark my morning workout. The rowing machine tells me if today’s workout was a personal best. Even better, I can go online and compare my workout to the efforts of thousands of other people.  On my way to work, I can track my mileage. (My record is 89 mpg). Once there, I can watch the status of my books on Amazon, comparing their sales to every other book published in the English language… and then go check out JungleScan.com, where I can track the book’s performance over the last 90 days.  The problem with benchmarking is that nothing but continuous improvement (except maybe spectacular results) satisfies very much. Who wants to know that they will never again be able to beat their personal best rowing time? What entrepreneur wants to embrace the fact that the wait time at her new restaurant franchise is 20% behind the leader—and there’s no obvious way to improve it?  Our interconnected, 500-channel world lets us be picky. We can want a husband who is as tall as that guy, as rich as this guy and as loyal as my brother-in-law. We can ask for an apartment that is in just the right location, with just the right view and just the right rent—and then reject it because the carpeting in the hallway isn’t as nice as the one in the building next door. Monster lets us see 5,000 resumes for every job opening… and imagine that we can find someone with this guy’s education and that woman’s professional experience—who works as cheap as this person and is as local as that one.  In the old days, data was a lot harder to come by. You didn’t know everything about everyone. All the options weren’t right there, laid out in Froogle and compared by epinions.com. We didn’t have reality TV shows where each and every component of a singer’s presentation or a bridal prospect’s shtick were painstakingly compared.  Yes, benchmarking is terrific. Benchmarking is the reason that cars got so much better over the last twenty years. Benchmarking has the inexorable ability to make the mediocre better than average, and it pushes us to always outperform.  But it stresses us out. A benchmarked service business or product (or even a benchmarked relationship) is always under pressure. It’s hard to be number one, and even harder when the universe we choose to compare our options against is, in fact, the entire universe.   Of course, the boomers have this problem even worse (and we’re all boomers, aren’t we? Even if you’re not, we don’t care—it’s all about us). Boomers are getting older. We can benchmark our eyesight, our rowing speed, our memory or even our ability to come up with great ideas at a moment’s notice. As a result, we benchmark ourselves into a funk. We get stressed because we have to acknowledge that nothing is as good as it was.  In addition to the stress, benchmarking against the universe actually encourages us to be mediocre, to be average, to just do what everyone else is doing. The folks who invented the Mini (or the Hummer, for that matter) didn’t benchmark their way to the edges. Comparing themselves to other cars would never have created these fashionable exceptions. What really works is not having everything being up to spec… what works is everything being good enough, and one or two elements of a product or service being AMAZING.   So, I’m officially letting go. I’m going to stop comparing everything to my all time best, to your all time best, to everyone’s all time best. Instead of benchmarking everything, perhaps we win when we accept that the best we can do is the best we can do—and then try to find the guts to do one thing that’s remarkable.  Was this my best blog entry ever, or what?     Remarkable?  Sounds like a "purple cow" to me...

       From Seth Godin's Blog...Are we so beat that we can't compete?  What's YOUR "free prize" inside?   Last month, I posted a bunch of notices looking to hire summer interns (yes, we're set, thanks). The ads asked people to send in a three page PDF, describing their background, their goals and giving applicants a chance to really stand out and make their case.  This, of course, should be the dream opportunity for most job seekers. Instead of being treated as a piece of paper, a list of stats in a dry resume, here was a chance to actually tell a little about yourself.  HALF the people sent in a resume. Just a resume.  "Here's my resume" was the total content of at least 20% of the cover notes I got.  Part of this is the result of being beaten down. Most of the system is about following the rules, fitting in and not standing out. But a lot of it, it seems to me, is that people are laboring under a very mistaken impression about what works--in life, in seeking a job and in marketing in general.  Most people, apparently, believe that if they just get their needle sharp enough, it'll magnetically leap out of the haystack and land wherever it belongs. If they don't get a great job or make a great sale or land a terrific date, it might just be because they don't deserve it.  Having met some successful people, I can assure you that they didn't get that way by deserving it.  What chance is there that your totally average resume, describing a totally average academic and work career is going to get you most jobs? "Hey Bill! Check out this average guy with an average academic background and really exceptionally average work experience! Maybe he's cheap!!"  Do you hire people that way? Do you choose products that way? If you're driving a Chevy Cavalier and working for the Social Security Administration, perhaps, but those days are long gone.  People are buying only one thing from you: the way the engagement (hiring you, working with you, dating you, using your product or service, learning from you) makes them feel.  So how do you make people feel?  Could you make them feel better? More? Could you create the emotions that they're seeking?  As long as we focus on the commodity, on the sharper needle, we're lost. Why? Because most customers don't carry a magnet. Because the sharpest needle is rarely the one that gets out of the haystack. Intead, buyers are looking for the Free Prize, for that exceptional attribute that's worth talking about. I just polled the four interns sitting here with me. Between them, they speak 12 languages. No, that's not why I hired them. No, we don't need Tagalog in our daily work.... but it's a free prize. It's one of the many things that made them interesting, that made me feel good about hiring them.  What's your Free Prize?

       Here's another great post from Mark Ramsey's Radio Marketing Nexus:  There are always two sides to every story!  Inside Radio reported the comments of ad buyer Natalie Swed Stone on the topic of long radio commercial pods.  She says they're a turnoff to buyers and advertisers "Commercials are lost in a pod and probably no one is hearing the spot."  MindShare senior partner David Marans says young listeners he's seen in recent focus groups are "very hostile" to long spot sets.  They also criticized the dismal caliber of radio creative which, they say, has "chased national advertisers away" from Radio.  So how are we to read all this?  First, it hardly seems surprising that the advertising community is in a huff about any configuration of spots which clusters them in long sets. My research shows that listeners love this because they can skip the whole cluster if they want to. Advertisers hate it, of course, for the same reason.   But still, why does Natalie say "probably no one is hearing the spot." Doesn't she KNOW that a spot is or isn't effective based on the RESULTS of the advertising campaign? And you don't mean to suggest that buyers are spending advertiser money with no regard for the effectiveness of the campaign in driving sales, do you Natalie? Do you mean to suggest that agencies are more interested in the placement of their spot in a set than whether the advertising actually works??  If I were an advertiser you can place my spot anywhere you want, just as long as I get results for my money. Or doesn't that matter, Natalie, in the grand "creative" scheme of things?  Second, the point about focus group respondents being "very hostile" to long spot sets. This is a conclusion that is heavily biased to favor the people doing the research who, themselves, are likely to be against such long spot-sets. My own research has completely contradicted this conclusion - when the opinions of the audience take precedence over those of the researchers.  There is a tradeoff, folks: Either fewer long stopsets or more shorter ones. My guess: Mindshare never presented that tradeoff. Instead, it was all about "longer or shorter: better or worse." Lovely.  Third, I'm not surprised national advertisers would show disdain for the truly poor quality of most radio creative. But, wait...Isn't it the job of agencies to make this creative high-quality enough to justify the spots in the first place? And aren't the agencies retained by the advertisers themselves?   Isn't this the equivalent of me calling my own baby "ugly"?

      From Mark Hurst's Good Experience weblog:   Here's a quick exercise.  Which of these is a better experience?  IN A RESTAURANT:  1. When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess welcomes you warmly and takes you to your table. The interior decoration and overall ambience are attractive and comfortable; the food is delicious.  Or, at a different restaurant...  2. The restaurant is called "The Jungle Experience." Upon entering, the hostess asks you how many are in your "safari." As you sit at your table, a fine mist of water sprays from a sprinkler hidden in the plastic foliage surrounding the dining area. The menu items are all named after rare tropical animals. You have the simulated experience of dining in a jungle, although the food isn't very good.  AT THE DENTIST:  1. The dentist is friendly, starts on time, is gentle on your gums, and gets your claim form promptly to the insurance company.  Or, at a different dentist...  2. The dentist's office is decorated in the theme of Star Trek. The walls are painted like the bridge of a starship; the dentist and assistants all wear Star Trek Federation uniforms and can, on request, greet you in Klingon. However, the dentist doesn't generally start on time and isn't as gentle as you'd like.  ON AN E-COMMERCE WEBSITE:  1. You're able to access the product you want in a few seconds, thanks to prominent links with obvious titles. The search function brings back accurate and helpful results. The simple product page makes it easy to compare different products, and then it's easy to choose a product and check out. Overall, the experience is quick and easy.  Or, at a different website...  2. You're impressed by the attractive logo and the colorful appearance of the page. It looks similar to the colors and graphics in the TV commercials for the company's products. There are lots and lots of features available on every page. Everything has a very professional appearance. Overall, you get the strong impression that the company spent a lot of money on the website. Unfortunately, it's hard to find the product you want.  In each case, did you choose 1 or 2 as the better experience?  - - -  Of course, these are somewhat artificial comparisons. Certainly a safari-theme restaurant could also (theoretically) have good service and delicious food. A Star Trek dentist could be on time. And so on.  But the comparisons are important because they represent two different methods of creating a good experience:  - In case 1, the company focuses on meeting the customer's needs at each moment.  - In case 2, the company creates an "experience" with a "wow factor" in an effort to impress the customer. The customer isn't central to the experience, except as a consumer waiting to be entertained. The focus here is visual flashiness and gratuitous technology.  Which method does your company pursue more often?  If it's 1, congratulations: you're operating in the long-term interest of both the company and your customers. And knowing that, you have the added benefit of a meaningful job - creating some good in the world (even if only the business world).  If 2, I wish you the best of luck. You might get short-term gains in customers and publicity - but without a focus on customers' basic needs, your business won't be healthy for very long.  I've had this conversation with many clients over the years. In many cases, the focus on the *basics* - customers' basic needs at each moment - is THE differentiating factor between successful and failing companies. In fact, companies who invest more in the "wow factor" almost always take resources *away* from focusing on those more important (if visually less exciting) issues.  But think back to the customer. After all, we started the column with an exercise in *customer* experience. If you - as a customer in each of those situations - had to choose between the basics and the "wow factor," which would it be? If you had to design the customer experience in each of those situations, and you wanted to maximize the long-term health of the company, which would it be?    Interestingly, in radio...we are so focused on the "window-dressing" and enhancing our shows, our stations, and our so-called image with "smoke and mirrors," that we forget to FOCUS on the long-term health of the OVER-ALL product.  There's always something beyond TODAY! (tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, etc.) Something to think about...

      Here's an interesting article from CBS Marketwatch. (via Mark Ramsey's Marketing Blog)  It sums up the challenges radio is facing with high commercial loads.  Have we dug a hole in the minds of advertisers that will be impossible to re-fill?   In the last 10 to 15 years, the number of radio commercial spots has risen dramatically, with ads now taking up 20 to 25 minutes of a given hour. Jacoby told clients in a research note, advertisers see the availability of radio commercials as "limitless," and therefore the commercials "lack perceived value."  Radio stocks will be "stuck," Jacoby said, "until [the] industry faces up to challenges."   How did we get in a position where we communicate to advertisers that more means less?  How do we raise rates?  How do we control inventory?  How can we back off the high spot loads (if and) when satellite radio reaches the point of threatening terrestrial radio revenues?

        This comes from Bob Barnett's&nbsp;previously published "All About Country" article that digs into the basics of country music programming:    &nbsp; On the outside, country music listeners come in many shapes and sizes.&nbsp; They vary in age, race, ethnic background, educational background, economic makeup, geographic locations, etc.   Country listeners come from all walks of life: from factory workers to executives, farmers to business owners. (Even President of the United States!)&nbsp; We see country consumers in small towns and big cities. This makes programming to the so-called “typical” country music listener more difficult.&nbsp; Rather than focus on these demographic elements, researchers began to study the shared values of groups of people.&nbsp; The thought being, if you understand their values, you can reach them emotionally.  In the early 90’s, we moved beyond demographics to  psychographics.  &nbsp; The study of Psychographics is defined as: “Characteristics of an audience based in ideology, values, beliefs and attitudes”  Some people were surprised at the results, while others saw the data as a mere validation of what we had already surmised by years of close observation and frequent research projects.  There were four values that jumped off the page to me.&nbsp; If they weren’t already part of the station’s programming philosophy, these big four have successfully become part of the programming foundation for any country radio station I’ve worked with.  In order to implement this newfound information as part of a programming plan, I came up with the “stool” analogy.&nbsp; Some people have used a reverse pyramid to illustrate it, but I believe the stool makes the point a bit clearer.  Think of a FOUR-LEGGED stool.&nbsp; At the top of the stool is a platform or seat that signifies the music:&nbsp; (Well-researched, hit-driven country music) the four legs provide a foundation for the musical format.&nbsp;   Leg #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Values Leg #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patriotism Leg #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spiritualism Leg #4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honoring and respecting the Legends of the format.  When one of the legs is weak, missing or coming up short, the stool “wobbles”&nbsp; (your ratings) For a stable stool, you need all four legs to be in place.  &nbsp;  Family Values :&nbsp; The psychographics profile of a “typical” country consumer includes a strong desire for kid-friendly, positive, family valued programming.&nbsp; This is a “benefit” to the country consumer.&nbsp; Like an Adult-Contemporary format that boasts of a “stress-free” listening experience, country should be embracing and promoting it’s “kid-friendly” experience.&nbsp; Take a long hard look at your programming and remove or down-play elements that are not.&nbsp; Unless you have research or dramatic ratings success with those personalities or individual elements, chances are they’re hurting you.&nbsp;    Patriotism: &nbsp; Is there another format that rallies around the flag more than country?&nbsp; Not a chance.&nbsp; The reason is plain and simple: the country audience bleeds red, white and blue.&nbsp; While it’s obvious to wave the flag in times of trouble, it’s an audience that responds to supporting the ideals of the “American way” (Canadian Way, Australian Way, etc.;) year ‘round.&nbsp; Utilizing patriotic programming elements is a power point of differentiation 365 days a year.&nbsp; Think about including verbiage in your standard imaging package.&nbsp; Utilize patriotic themes in special programming, music mixes, holiday packages, etc.&nbsp; You can never be TOO patriotic.&nbsp; I think most programmers “get” the patriotism element. Don’t forget that you can wave the flag all year long!&nbsp; Honor the vets, support the troops, memorialize the fallen, etc.    Spiritualism :&nbsp; This is personified as a “belief in a higher power”.&nbsp; While it’s not exclusively characterized as “Christian”, it can probably be best summarized as “Christian heavy.”&nbsp; The down-to-earth ideals long associated with country stem from this stool leg.&nbsp; (All men are created equal)&nbsp; The psychographics profiles showed a feeling that country artists “put their pants on one leg at a time” too.&nbsp; In addition, there is a very high “forgiveness of sin” associated with this group.&nbsp; There is a realization that as humans, we ALL make mistakes and should be given a second chance if we apologize and make amends. This forgiveness of sin results in the premise that they’re also aware of his or her own sins. (We can point out many examples of country artists that have erred or strayed resulting in being rejected and punished by the audience, and eventually welcomed back)&nbsp; What do you have planned for Easter weekend?&nbsp; Is it the generic “Spring Bunny” promotion or a focus on the most important yearly Christian holiday?&nbsp; (I usually pull out “He’s Alive” by Dolly Parton and play it every 3 hours from Good Friday to Easter Sunday night…talk about listener feedback!)   Respect for the Legends :&nbsp; This audience believes in “remembering who brought you to the dance.”&nbsp; While it doesn’t necessarily mean you NEED to play classic titles or legendary artists.&nbsp; What it DOES mean is you should NEVER disrespect them.&nbsp; Honor them for their role in the history of the format and what they brought to country music.&nbsp; It’s not a coincidence that the awards shows pay tribute and induct format veterans into the Hall of Fame with a very PUBLIC ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp; When an artist dies, respectfully honor them.&nbsp; You might even want to consider including your station’s tribute to the legends/classics as part of your web site.&nbsp; Maybe have your own Wxxx “Country Music Hall of Fame”?&nbsp; (Heck, it’s just a link off your web page!)  I’ve discovered over time, that these four stool legs support the musical format.&nbsp; They provide a foundation for the radio station that is consistent with the psychographics values of the country music audience.   Other key findings :&nbsp; The “survivalist” attitude indexes very high among country music partisans.&nbsp; (Life is hard, terrible things happen, but we’ll survive)&nbsp; There’s an “us versus them” attitude.&nbsp; The country life-group hates “legislative behavior”. &nbsp;They don’t like being told what to do, hates red tape and bureaucracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a big desire to “belong”…thus, a lot of group involvement and feelings of nationalism.&nbsp; (Does it surprise you that Radio-thons are VERY effective on country radio stations but not on CHR’s?)&nbsp;   There’s more psychographics data available. The sum of the data paints a clear picture of the average country listener’s value system regardless of the demographics.&nbsp; Keep in mind we’re NOT talking about their age, how much they earn, where they live, or their background.&nbsp; We’re talking about the basic core values that are consistent from person to person.&nbsp; These are values that index higher than other music genres.&nbsp; (In some cases, indexing at such high levels that it’s OBVIOUS)  There are some people that will argue that it’s never a good idea to “lump” people into groups saying that everyone is different.&nbsp; That argument doesn’t hold water when you start looking at values-based information.&nbsp; It’s clear that you CAN appeal to the MAJORITY with some basic understanding of these shared values.   How do you use it to get better ratings ?&nbsp; Look at your station’s imaging and branding?&nbsp; Are these benefits reflected in your station’s “sell”?&nbsp; Do you use it as a “filter” when deciding which promotions or marketing campaigns to use.&nbsp; Do you select and participate in community events that are in sync with the core values? When picking music to play, does that particular song fit the values profile or does that song appeal outside of the country profile?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is station air-talent in sync with the values?&nbsp; Is station content properly filtered to appeal to the target?&nbsp; Are your commercials producing negative listener response?&nbsp; (Some country stations have begun accepting sexual enhancement ads or air other commercials with less than “kid-friendly” verbiage or content)&nbsp;   I truly believe that zeroing in on these basics will help stations in markets that are beginning to wrestle with attracting Hispanic listeners to country music stations.&nbsp; We’re finding that it’s more about shared values than skin color or ethnic background.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Morning Show Consultant Randy Lane shares some DJ School 101 Refreshers:    1.  Credibility is everything …keep it real. The most important quality to cutting through the clutter and succeeding today is to develop a trusting relationship with listeners. They must perceive that you tell the truth, that you tell it like it really is."Jocking" or announcing is formula. It is being on automatic pilot without any feeling or emotion. Feeling it involves intention and emotion. No feeling, no emotion, no intention equals no communication. Even "coming up next" can either be read or communicated with meaning.  2.  Finding your voice, your ‘Comic Perspective’ … Arbitron is still a game of memory and recall. Break-through talents combine credibility with strong characterization, which means expressing yourself with your own vision of the world around you and establishing the essence of your relatability; to people listening who either are like you or your opposite.   Some examples include:  Observational Everyman (normal guy/woman with wacked out people around him/her) People pleaser Cynic Perennially single female  3.  The secret to mastering any performance skill is not trying too hard . Trying too hard usually means thinking too much about what you’re doing during performance. The time to think is when you’re planning the show before you go on the air and during songs and commercials. While you’re on the air be alert and completely in the moment. Being a great listener is a major part of being aware and being focused in the present moment.  4.  Prep. Prep. Prep . Highly revered basketball coach John Wooden said it best, "Failing to prepare is preparing to fail." Avoid reading or memorizing. Master the material with the goal being spontaneity and sincerity.  5.  Pay attention to what’s important . Distractions keep talent from being in the moment and focused on the message, caller or break. Instant Messaging, request lines, sales people, and friends in the studio are just some of the distractions that will keep talent from connecting with listeners.  6.  Know the selling priorities . For example with promotions, in a Justin Timberlake contest that involved giving away his CD and a trip to see him perform live in Miami, the trip is obviously the most enticing part of the giveaway to listeners.    The following is a useful guide to use:&nbsp;      Attention    Think from the listeners perspective and lead with the biggest listener benefit, a headline or hook to get their attention. Using the example above: "Wanna fly to Miami to see Justin Timberlake?"    Interest    Make it enticing, alluring to capture their interest…"South Beach, stars, hot babes & hot guys and see the hottest Pop performer today!"    Detail    Use only bottom line, need-to-know information on live sells leaving details to produced promos. "When you hear a Justin Timberlake song call to win his CD and a shot at the Miami Fly Away, we’ll tell you all about in just a few minutes on KISS FM.    Action    Urge them to take action…"Listen for Justin Timberlake’s new song in the next 20 minutes to win a trip to South Beach...."  7.  Sell the call letters/station name with pride and enthusiasm and say them a lot.  Say the station calls/name often as you can work it in to conversation and to make it stand out. Look for new and different ways to highlight the station/name.&nbsp; It’s been proven in Arbitron over and over that the stations with the most name mentions tend to have higher recall and therefore cume.  8.  Focus on getting more TSL . The best talent are focused on ONE mission -- stretching TSL. Talent can press the flesh to build cume, but on air there is really only one thing they can do to increase ratings: convince that moment’s audience to keep listening or tune in again another time. Lead with something great that will get listener’s attention and keep them listening, or tease upcoming content to generate another listening occasion.  9.  Talking in music sweeps : make a song-to-song segue by hitting the second song at full volume, let it establish for approximately one second, and then talk over the song intro. The exception to this guideline would be with cold/no intro songs, and then it is acceptable to talk on the back fade of the song quickly.&nbsp; Avoid ‘bridging two songs’, where the jock starts talking on the fade of one song and then starts the second song under the rap. Forward momentum and energy is increased when you hit the next song and deliver your quick message.   Note: It is important to totally respect the music in some formats where its policy not to talk over the music at all. If there is any talk in music sweeps it’s done between songs .  10.  Avoid letting songs fade too long . Take the song out at the point that the song starts to fade, in other words, before there is any noticeable fade on the air. Hit the next song at slightly higher volume and pull the previous song volume down. Of&nbsp; course you don’t want to cut the song in the middle of a word, which would make it obvious to listeners, but you can exit on the end of a refrain or phrase while the song is still hot.  11.  Avoid talking over any vocals on song intros . It sounds fine to talk between anyvocal intros, as long as it’s not vocal-over-vocal. And remember the cardinal rule of good delivery: just because it’s a 60 second lip, doesn’t mean you HAVE to chatter for 60 seconds.  12.  Focus on one main thought/theme per talk break . By doing this you increase the chance of your message or content being remembered by listeners. The typical listener is listening with something less than 20% of their consciousness. To have a chance at delivering a message that gets through, it needs to be focused on one important thing they care about. Multiple thought breaks and laundry lists of upcoming content obscure the important message and detract from memorability.  13.  Pot up low level intros all the way to full volume so there is no drop on the air . Keeping the audio levels consistent is good for TSL. Constantly changing audio levels is annoying and a cause of tune-out.  14.  The voice-to-music ratio when talking over song intros should be similar to that of a lead singer’s voice in a song . Listeners will ideally hear the voice being slightly dominant over the music, yet both clearly audible -- you don’t want to be buried by the music nor have the voice to be so dominant that it obscures the music. The exact right place to be in the music and your distance from the microphone are two variables to play with. Listen to tapes of your show with different settings and see how it sounds without headphones on. Headphones can make things sound very different from car speakers in rush hour.  15.  Make music beds repetitive and consistent without a lot of distracting musical changes . Avoid horns and vocals. The main purpose of using beds is to lift the energy level of conversations and fill in dead spaces. Listeners shouldn’t notice beds unless they’re used for staging to get listeners’ attention.  16.  Be quick- but don’t hurry . There’s a difference between being efficient and succinct and rushing through conversations. If you hurry, you’re more likely to make mistakes, but if you’re not quick, you won’t get things done and you will bore your listener. The bottom line is to be a good self-editor. This is particularly important for set ups. The set up to any bit, interview, feature, etc. is critical to its success.  17.  Set Ups:  Clearly and enthusiastically set up a feature, bit or conversation to get listeners’ attention and pique their interest. Listeners make a mental decision on whether to listen to something after the first sentence of introduction.   18.  Exits:  Don’t miss the exit on the freeway -- remember to get out at an impact point. Develop a sense for when to end a conversation, bit, etc. Leave the listeners on a high note with something strong and memorable.  19.  Branding.  Get ownership of your content by attaching the station and/or show name to all features. Creative and entertaining produced intros and outros help you brand content.  20.  Teasing.  Teasing upcoming content is the absolute best way to fuel TSL. This also adds to people feeling like they’re going to miss something if they don’t listen every day or listen longer. TV entertainment shows and newscasts have made an absolute science out of enticing billboarding and teasing to create momentum and build longer viewing. They devote 25% of content time to previewing! Talent who ‘get’ the art of teasing will consistently outperform talent who don’t.

        Morning show&nbsp;consultant Randy Lane shares his observations about talent's primary job:&nbsp;Selling      Outside mornings, the talent’s job in essence breaks down to three major areas:   1. Sell the music  2. Sell the station  3. Sell yourself    Sell the music : what interesting artist tidbits do you have? A good goal is an artist information piece each hour of your show. Something the audience doesn’t know that you can use the 80-20 Rule* when teasing a song coming up. Avoid laundry-listing artist names… most people in your target know a song when they hear it or its hook, but only a few know songs by artist name.    Sell the station : use the positioning statement and station name like you LOVE them. As hard as it can be after saying the same thing a hundred times, you must sound excited about it. It’s similar to an actor in a play saying the same lines sometimes for years. They have to deliver them as if it’s the first time they said them for the benefit of people in the audience who are seeing the play for the first time. Don’t let yourself get on autopilot, say it live like it was the first time every time.    Sell yourself : tell listeners who you are on every break, and bring something&nbsp;about yourself to the show every day. Your annoyance about the potholes on the highway, a relationship issue that ensued after watching Friends, etc. The prepping comes in figuring how you can bring out your life experience stuff on the air.   * 80/20 Rule:   Give listeners 80% of the story and leave out the resolution to drive them crazy so they have to keep listening for what you tease. They get the story, but you leave out the juicy 20% that keeps them listening. Example: "Madonna is pregnant again. Who’s the father? I’ll tell you coming up...."    Two Selling Tips      1.  Other Daypart Exposure . One of the greatest ways for non-morning talent to bond with listeners and to increase the amount of morning show listeners that know you and listen to your show is to be on the morning show. Spend time with the morning show talent when possible, let them know you are available to come in early and help with morning show bits when needed. Most morning shows can give music jocks more exposure in a morning than on an entire week of your own shift. It particularly works great for the morning and afternoon show personalities to call one another or do a break on their respective shows. This will help to recycle listeners between the two drive periods and build awareness for each show in the opposite drive.   2.  Direct your show’s marketing . Instead of waiting for the sales department to come to you with pizza coupons and one week health club memberships to "promote" your show, brainstorm with yourself and come up with some ideas you would like to do this year to help your show build awareness.   For example, if you aren’t claustrophobic, have the marketing department bury you a mile below an automobile dealership and get a week’s worth of press while the sales department makes money, or broadcast from a street corner collecting money for a local homeless shelter with a major sponsor matching all the donations. Market yourself, don’t wait for someone to  come along and wave the magic wand.    Randy Lane Answers Questions on Content Issues:     How can I bring up entertainment/celebrity information less awkwardly?   Rather than bringing it up out of the blue, first look for a tie-in to the music, or a feature coming up on the station (e.g. Hollywood Dirt). Also look for connections in local and topical stories going on in the market. If there are no tie-ins, simply finish the station business, formatics, etc. and then start it with a listener question (to get their attention)…"Hey, did you hear that….or  "Madonna is causing a controversy…".etc.    Since most stations do this type of information, how can I get ownership?   You get ownership and recall by putting a unique spin on the story that no one else has taken. End your spiel with a plug for the benchmark, e.g. "Get all the hot entertainment scoop tomorrow morning on Lindsay’s E-Buzz on the Bert Show on Q100."    What’s the best way to transition from the fundamentals to a topic and back?   Simply reset a topic that is continuing by starting with a clip of a listener or restating a strong opinion from a listener. End by teasing the continuation of the topic. Reset again over song intros to keep the momentum going.    How long should I continue topics?   Topics are done when listeners begin to repeat points and there are no new perspectives being given. That could be after one show segment or the entire show.    What’s the best way to build character without coming off like I’m talking about myself all the time?   Always use your experiences and your character in ways that relate to the audience. It’s helpful to use one-on-one language such as, "Did you ever notice… In ensemble situations or when conversing with another person it is very effective to bring out character traits and personalize experiences in one another.

        Some interesting points from    urlLink   Sean Ross      - VP of Music & Programming at Edison Research     Several years ago, when Cox’s radio stations began imaging heavily around playing at least “50 minutes of music” each hour, I remember thinking that it hadn’t been so long since 50 minutes of music would not have seemed exceptional. Anybody who’s been in the business since the early ‘90s can remember when two three minute stopsets an hour outside of morning drive were ideal, two four minute breaks were typical, and two five minute breaks were where PDs started to get a little nervous about spot load.  But we’re coming from a much different place these days. So for most of its stations, Clear Channel’s just announced spot reduction initiative will represent a significant change. Effective next January, CC music stations will run a maximum of 10 minutes of spots per hour from 10 a.m. to midnight on their music formats and 15 minutes at News/Talk.  Some thoughts on what the Clear Channel initiative means for stations, CC-owned or otherwise:  Being able to credibly image around more music is always a good thing, but it’s only the first step for any station. Cox’s stations are most likely better off for having publicly committed to fewer spots, but they have tracked up and down like everybody else’s, even though most of them hit the music quantity imagery hard.   A few Cox stations, such as KKBQ (93Q) Houston and WPYM (Party 93.1) Miami have pounded their rivals on that front, but the ratings suggest that it’s easier to hurt a competitor that way than to make your own station huge. If you’re a mainstream CHR, fewer spots won’t give you more viable pop product. If you’re Oldies, cutting the spot load won’t make the demos younger. And if you’re Howard Stern, you’re doing just fine with a high spot load at the moment.&nbsp;   Being able to credibly image around more music is harder than ever. Listeners are still recovering from those music quantity battles of a decade ago where stations had to make “in-a-row” promises that they couldn’t consistently keep. Those were followed by more generic commitments—“here comes another long music sweep”—that were more believable but had less impact. Stations are going to have to find ways to communicate the more music message on the air that listeners believe. And they’re going to have to find a way to be “new and improved” without making listeners think they were old and lousy before.&nbsp;   Creativity will make a difference. Rhythmic Top 40 WRDW (Wired 96.5) Philadelphia is imaging around only one stopset an hour, but what really cuts through is the promos built around consultant Jerry Clifton’s faux-Hawaiianism “nottalottatalka.” And even before the Clear Channel announcement, one already had a greater sense of stations looking for ways to draw attention to “more music,” such as imaging around shorter stopsets.&nbsp;   January is still two ratings books away. It’s hard to cut spot loads now when you’ve got political ad season and holiday advertising coming up. And a lot of stations are planning to run all-Christmas formats and those do transcend spotload. But if you’re lucky enough to already have a lower spot load story, you should be telling it on the air now and taking advantage of the national publicity this story has created. In January, you’ll be competing with all those other electronic toys, whether iPod, Xbox, or satellite radio, which listeners have gotten over the holidays. &nbsp;   For years, the notion of being able to sell fewer commercials and charge more for them has been one of those concepts that was so perfectly sensible that, of course, it could never happen. Even in the days before consolidation, it took only one operator in a market willing to sell “dollar-a-holler” spots to destroy everybody’s rate integrity. While one would like to see more operators follow Cox and CC’s lead, the industry may benefit in listeners’ minds regardless.   One colleague, pondering why spot load hasn’t yet become a more exploitable issue for more stations suggests that there’s a listener perception of clutter as an industry problem that individual stations cannot transcend. Fair or not, CC epitomizes today’s radio to some listeners. So maybe the consumer press publicity that’s accompanying this announcement will create a perception of fewer spots overall.   All of which leads back to a need for all radio stations to tell all their stories better—not just those related to spot load. In recent years, radio has been more aggressive than ever about addressing other longstanding complaints, from variety to repetition. Those moves often don’t translate to the consumer press where there’s still often a view of operators as determined to do the worst, lowest common denominator radio possible.   Within hours of its announcement, the CC spot load announcement had given radio another opportunity to address the public again. And it’s given more than 1,000 broadcasters the chance to worry less about making their stations listenable and turn to making their stations compelling.

        Excerpts from Tom Asacker's BLOG:    &nbsp; I recently purchased a Jackson Browne CD after watching a 60 minutes segment on the songwriter. Then a friend told me that Browne was a woman-beater (he allegedly hit, his then girlfriend, Darryl Hannah). That bit of "information" made me want to toss his CD out of the car window. Then I read that the story wasn't true. All of which left me ambivalent and somewhat emotionally distant from the Jackson Browne brand.  Here's the insight: a brand is nothing more than a bundle of emotions, loosely held together by trust and reputation. Once you lose it - like Jackson Browne may have over a nasty rumor, or which  urlLink Kentucky Fried Chicken  certainly lost with me after PETA released a videotape Tuesday of one of their suppliers kicking, stomping and throwing chickens against a wall - you may never get it back.

      Storytelling – Part 2:&nbsp; From morning show consultant Randy Lane:  Besides mining your past for stories, which we covered in the last Bullet Points issue, you can become more sensitive to the potential story material in the present and even the future. This extra-attentiveness is "story-stalking".  Inspired by an exercise where people in a class knew they were going to have to tell a story about a ‘magic moment’ they became much more watchful for such moments than they used to be. They even made those moments happen so they could talk about them later. Occasionally give yourself an assignment to do something expressly for the sake of the story you might get out of it. (E.g. shopping for a wedding dress)  HOW TO TELL STORIES It’s a stock joke in TV sitcoms: One of the characters launches into a long, rambling reminiscence while the rest of the characters roll their eyes, squirm and swear under their breaths, waiting for the self-enraptured speaker to shut up. What’s the problem? The reminiscence is so specific to the person speaking, and so inscrutable to its listeners, that the latter can’t help crying out internally, "What onearth is the point of this story?" Or, more selfishly, "What does this have to do with ME?"  A good story mediates between two different worlds. One is the concrete world of details – signs, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, and physical actions that an individual experiences. The other is the abstract world of concepts – subjects, themes, thoughts and theories that relate to common experience. A good story combines the timebound (specific moments) with the timeless (general meanings). It connects the teller (a specific person) with the outside world (listeners in general).  Most of us can appreciate that an effective story is one that offers distinctive images to appeal to the senses. We’re less certain about the story value of stimulating the mind with general concepts. Not every story needs a moral – moralizing is often inappropriate in storytelling. However, every story does need a larger, more ideabased frame of reference than simply its details.  For example, to say ‘The king died, and then the queen dies’ is not a story. To say, ‘The king died and then the queen died of grief’ is a story. It ties into the frame of reference of grief that we can all relate to.  A story needs to be something you can make a connection with and the audience can also make a connection with. Another way to say it is: can you find a way to connect to this audience through this story? A really good story resonates with some basic universal aspects of being human, be those humorous, moving, or grief-stricken. If the story is a good story, it is good because it has some deep truths running through it. (Eg. The Itsy Bitsy Spider)  PREPARING YOUR STORIES IN ADVANCE It is essential to have a clear sense of where you’re going when you tell a story –what major stepping stones do you need to go from where you begin your story to where you want to end.  Create the beginning last. Once you see where the story is going and how it will end, you can go back and create the beginning. An ending that is somewhat foreshadowed at the beginning will get the greatest response. Portraying a person, evoking a place, illuminating an event or breathing life into an abstraction is usually a much easier point of departure for developing a story than thinking up a plotline.  Then use preconceived images (the key story scenes). In these key scenes you depict something happening instead of just saying that it happened. Give the listener the sensation of being right there. When a story works we see it happening inside our head. So don’t ask, how do I tell this story? Ask how do I show this story. You have to find the "hook" or the problem of the story. If you already have the "someone" and the "someplace", you need to have the problem, the conflict – the hook – something that needs to be solved or changed.  DRAMATIC PATTERNS When telling&nbsp;a tale that does have plot developments, good stories tend to be shaped into the same archetypal, four-step dramatic pattern:  1. A starting-point situation, or status quo, is described.  2. Something changes in that situation to cause drama or impending drama: a catastrophe, a stroke of good fortune, a personal decision a life passage, a small but potent outside development.  3. A turning point in the drama is reached and somehow experienced: a specific crisis, conflict or challenge.  4. An aftermath, or end-point situation, is described.  "Coming back" is an important element in a good story. If a story is about your grandmother’s gloves, it starts with the image of the grandmother’s gloves, and somehow you have got to bring that image back at the end – even if you have to twist things a little bit from the way the really happened. (Remember that emotional honesty is more important than historical accuracy.)  ENLIVENING THE VERBAL TELLING OF YOUR STORIES:  • Add dialogue. Nothing works better in a story than dialogue to snag a listener’s attention.  • Show, don’t tell. Re-create events rather than simply reporting them. Also use vocal tones, pacing, facial expressions, gestures and body language. (Using body language in the studio will translate to more emotional vocal expression on the air.)  • Appeal to all five senses. "My blue English racing bike" is better than "my bike".  • Details. Often the difference between a good comic moment and a great one is the application of detail to the picture. Detail helps in two ways: it makes your story much more vivid to the listener. Detail draws people more deeply in, creates more emotional investment. Second, actively going for detail gives you a keener sense and a clearer picture of your own work.  • Decide what facts can be omitted. Generally, the best stories cut to the chase and get right to the action.  • Build in repetitions. Repeating important or interesting words, phrases, facts or sentence structure can lend it a pleasing sense of structure and familiarity.  • Plan appropriate pacing and inflection. (Slowly or swiftly, loudly or softly, seriously or comically, insistently or tentatively) Pauses can be some of the most effective moments in a tale. Many stories can be improved by telling them at half-speed.  • Put aside the rush to the finish line. Avoid getting ahead of the audience. You don’t want to be more excited about, more in love with, the story than they are. We all know people who tell stories like that – saying something really adventurous or funny happened to them and then it’s "having a lint ball in their bellybutton". It’s more effective to be a little bit behind the audience. You want them to think it’s funnier than you do. You’re always feeling a little bit surprised if they think something is powerful or wonderful. Respect the laugh zone.  • Prepare your listeners. "I’ve got a great story to tell you." Offer a brief statement that lets your audience know its subject or something relevant about it, or any simple reason why you like to tell it. It’s very difficult to get listener interest by devaluing yourself with statements like: "I’m not very good at this…"  • Bring the story to a definite close. Set up the ending by alluding to it earlier in the story, state directly that the end is coming, gradually slow your pace or put emphasis on the final few words. You can even reiterate the point of the story: "And that’s how Aunt Caroline caught the elephant!"  • You can’t make a story funny. The funny things in stories aren’t usually punch lines. They are descriptive places. And when people laugh, they are saying, "Ah, I see that. Ah, I’ve been there."  • A lot of people tend to start a story too late. They start it in the middle of the crisis event, instead of setting up the whole place and the people and what is normal before the world all falls apart. If you start the story too late, people are listening to it, saying "Well, so what?" Try to build a normal world and then turn it over.  • Do not memorize – connecting with a listener works best when the storyteller is re-creating the story for himself with each telling.  • If you’re worried about putting too much "I" focus in a tale, devote more attention to the other characters. If you think you appear too heroic, temper this image with some appropriate glimpses of your more human side – flaws.

        Observations from Mark Ramsey's BLOG:    When your product gets on  urlLink the cover of Newsweek , there's something very big going on. And it's something that will have profound impact on Radio.  As I have long argued, an iPod is fundamentally NOT like a portable tape or CD player. It is Personalized Radio - ME-FM.  If it contains hits which swap in and out, if it rotates music, then it's not a supplement to Radio, it's a substitute.  What was the last radio station on the cover of Newsweek?  The last portable tape or CD player?&nbsp; Hmmm?

        Thoughts from Mark Ramsey's Blog:     &nbsp;  That's what new NAB Radio Board Chairman Bruce Reese thinks, according to this interview with urlLink  Radio Ink . The 18-30 year-old listener is the one we're at risk of losing, he says. He then goes on to say that Radio's greatest strength is localism.   Well, needless to say, being the most local medium is not the key to sustaining the loyalties of 18-30 year-olds.&nbsp; These people are heading for the hills because, primarily, there are some really good radio substitutes out there - especially the one on  urlLink the cover of Newsweek  this week.  I would argue the biggest challenge to Radio is NOT the 18-30 year-old listener. It's creating programming that is COMPELLING for the 18-30 year-old listener in an era when "playing the hits" is no longer sufficient to draw and sustain their interest.   Now, more than ever, there is room in Radio for fresh approaches - and especially fresh non-music-based approaches.   Talent, you see, has always been and will always be a scarce commodity. And it's one you can't swap on KAZAA.

        From Randy Lane:    In the past, in a time when people made more of their own things, they created more stories about their life experiences. They did it to give each other insights, to entertain each other, and to engage each other in times of celebration, trial, mourning, or reverence. Primarily they did it to connect with each other. Sharing real-life stories was an essential element in forging friendships, alliances, families, and communities. It brought individuals a greater intimacy with each other and, simultaneously, a stronger sense of self.  For any speaker, and especially in radio, it is essential that you “get the crowd on your side.” In the movie Gladiator, Russell Crowe learned this secret very well. You have to give people a reason to care about you. There is no better way to let them know who you are and why they should be interested in you than by telling engaging stories about yourself. Not full blown stories – just interesting anecdotes that the audience can identify with, that help to create a common ground between you.  • The primary purpose of personal storytelling is not to entertain listeners, or to educate them, but to engage them in one’s own experience.  • Stories make you more human – stories help you to “experience a special communion”.   WHAT TELLING STORIES DOES FOR US 1. It connects us more vitally with others. 2. It develops our creativity. 3. It strengthens our humor. 4. It increases our courage and confidence. 5. It actually makes our lives more memorable. Getting  involved in developing and telling personal stories keeps us from unfairly dismissing large portions of our lives as boring, routine, or unremarkable. It’s a common type of selfdenial: “I don’t have a colorful background: I’m a WASP”, “No one wants to hear about my job. Trust me, it’s really boring.” “Nothing much happens to me. I lead an ordinary life.”  6. Stories are attention-getters. Think of a classroom – when a teacher really wants to get the students’ attention, he drops a little story in. “It’s like watching fish come out of the sea. Kids pick their heads up.”  HOW DO I COME UP WITH STORIES?  Finding the right stories for yourself is at least fifty percent of effective storytelling. Be conscious of the character you have developed on the air and your own endearing qualities and flaws to make sure a story is right for you. An audience looks for is consistency -- it turns out that meeting an audience’s expectation is about the single most useful thing a comic creator can do to win an audience’s allegiance. Violating that expectation is the kiss of death. Changing the rules leaves an audience feeling confused and betrayed.  Mining your Past for Stories  Childhood memories are especially valuable to use, and can inspire stories whose subject matter has the best chance of appealing to listeners of every age, temperament, and cultural background. Childhood is the grand common denominator among human beings.  Big stories are generally the first ones we remember, because they have great personal significance they can be recalled more vividly. Little stories are tales in which your own personal identity is less significantly involved. Little stories tend to have a broader appeal to listeners precisely because they aren’t so deeply personal. Rather than spotlighting an intense and unique individual experience, their main point is to illuminate a gentler, more common aspect of human experience (e.g. struggling through the first day of a new job, getting lost on a vacation, dealing with obnoxious neighbors, etc.).  Many stories are neither big nor little, but are hybrids. These mixed-breed stories are often our most effective ones. We can provide safe, meaningful glimpses of a very upsetting but important event in our lives by confining it to the background of a smaller, less disturbing drama.  How do we go about reviving memories of our early years? If you have difficulty reconnecting with significant moments in your past, you can be reasonably certain that it’s not due to a loss of memories, but to situational or attitudinal barriers that keep memories at bay.  Don’t worry about the TRUTH. A story about your past is not a formal deposition. Enliven your memories with creativity and, at the same time, respect their essential truth. Embroider on whatever you do remember. Even if you do remember all the details you may want to ‘translate’ the story so you don’t violate privacy or inadvertently depress, anger or confuse a listener whose frame of reference may be radically different from your own.  The process of focusing our attention more systematically on our earliest memories can take two different forms: thinking backward or feeling backward.  Thinking backward involves mentally pursing a certain, pre-chosen image or subject, step by step, year by year into our personal past: for example, “dating experiences,” “automobiles,” “hiding places,” “math.” Feeling backward entails digging down, layer by layer, into a particular aspect of our emotional history – being an emotional archeologist. The areas of concentration might be “peak experiences,” “jealousy,” “my feelings about my mother,” “times when I was torn by conflict,” “people I’ve had crushes on,” “fear,” “physical pain.”  ACTIVITY:  Try an activity called “loafing and inviting your soul”. This involves finding 20 minutes in a dimly lit room with no interruptions, getting in a position that is comfortable and opening your mind to ponder your childhood in general. Turn your mind loose, recalling specific people, places, events, sounds, smells and stories. If your mind roams, gently lead it back. Loaf with your eyes open and slightly unfocused to avoid falling asleep. Don’t take notes during – give yourself a few minutes afterward to jot stuff down.  ACTIVITY:  A simple but powerful way to generate personal story ideas is to use a ‘lifeline’. On a blank sheet of paper, you draw a straight vertical line representing your life. Then you note significant things that happened at appropriate points along that line. You can do other people’s parallel and intersecting lifelines as well as you own. Do research to fill in the lifelines.  ACTIVITY:  The emotions of our hearts are the fuel and fodder for original stories. Whatever goes to your emotional core and triggers events is excellent material for personal stories. Make a list of emotions to conjure up when and how you may have felt them.  ACTIVITY:  Use old photographs as powerful tools for story-making. Take a photo and note the expressions on the faces, the postures and other body language messages, the clothes, the surrounding environment, specific objects within the environment, etc. Then ask yourself a bunch of questions like “What was happening in my life at this time?”, “Who actually took the photograph and why?”, “What are the people thinking?”  ACTIVITY:  Draw pictures to help come up with ideas. Draw the layout of your family home and fill in as much as you can. Sketch a map of your childhood neighborhood. Draw the floorplan of your radio station and its offices.  ACTIVITY:  Draw the outline of your body, mark and label different parts and any part that has been affected by injury, illness, dysfunction, habit – exercise, if you wear glasses, bald spot, tattoo, broken bone and then think back to what events led up to it, how you felt, what resulted, etc.

       "Champions aren't made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them - a desire, a dream, a vision."     From Tom Asacker's BLOG...how can we apply this aspect to the "stale" programming elements in place in our radio stations? What are our causes?      From "Ring around the collar" to "Go ahead. Get dirty." Even Unilever knows that 'problem-solution' marketing is passé. We certainly know by now that Wisk cleans dirt and stains, so why keep telling us? We'll simply tune the message out (despite what many ad pros continue to believe).   I like Wisk's new attempt to be relevant and have some fun. Maybe it's because I'm a big kid at heart. Take a look at their web site: AmericaNeedsDirt.com. They show jars of dirt with headlines like: "Reintroducing the world's first toy," Keep in the reach of children," "Messy=Fun," and "Your long-lost childhood friend."  They are also trying to tap in to some of our culture's real needs; like getting people to exercise and play more to fight stress and obesity. Here are a few "factoids" included in some of their ads: "The average American child watches four hours of television a day," "On average, Americans spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors, " and "Studies suggest that preserving a sense of fun helps manage stress."  So here’s my question: if something as banal as detergent can have some fun and champion a cause, why can’t you?

        Have you seen the latest "Purple Cow" at the supermarket?  I noticed this a few weeks ago.  This is an observation by Brand Autopsy regarding the new Heinz Ketchup labels.  I'm extremely brand loyal to Heinz Ketchup...and their latest "free prize inside" made me snicker... This makes one wonder how we can do the same with our radio stations, shows, marketing, etc. to make consumers do a double-take and feel good about our product at the same time!?    Heinz is running it's second talking label "Say Something Ketchuppy" contest. As the promotional material reads:  Sometimes our label gets tired of saying "Tomato Ketchup" all of the time. We received a huge response from our first talking label contest, and now our ketchup is begging for more of your ideas. So make a joke about french fries or have some fun at the expense of mustard.   I needed to grab a new bottle of ketchup for my 4th of July dogs and took a moment to stop and read the condiments. I laughed out loud - at ketchup.  Heinz turned a chore of low excitement into something fun. I found myself moving bottles around on the shelf to find the label that I liked best.  I chose: WILL WORK FOR FOOD  Other labels include:  MEATLOAF ENHANCER  HIDES GRILL MARKS  You can find more talking labels on their website and contest rules are posted if you wish to enter.  Heinz has done a great job of making the common, uncommon. Yes, it's a teeny bit more expensive but, as they hoped, they make the picnic table a little more fun.  Also, check out the Jones Soda Company. They make common soda uncommon with exotic flavors and labels that feature images submitted by customers.  Fire up the grill!

        From Brand Autopsy:    Being visionary is a double-edged sword. Sometimes you can be so visionary that others can't relate, understand, or even care. The Segway Human Transporter is a great example. Everyone will agree that the Segway is inventive and visionary. But this visionary "scooter" is so visionary that people can't relate to it, understand it, or even care about it. On the other hand, a simple visionary device like the iPod is an invention people can relate to, understand, and care about.  Whole Foods Market was/is visionary in the natural/organic foods arena. For many years, people outside of the core wellness audience couldn't relate, understand, or care about Whole Foods vision of changing the way the world eats by selling only natural and organic goods. But that has changed as more and more people can relate to, understand, and care about living a more authentic, tastier, and healthier life.  Now, Whole Foods is about to embark on another VISIONARY goal ... Animal Compassionate standards that go WAY BEYOND their currently high standards for how they require farmers and ranchers to raise their pigs, cattle, chickens, etc for human consumption. Fast Company's profile of WFM in their July issue touched upon this visionary animal compassionate goal. The double-edge sword for WFM is ... this visionary goal will come at a cost to consumers. The beef, chicken, pork sold under these animal compassionate standards will be HIGHER in retail cost. Will customers relate, understand, and care enough about this visionary goal to pay a higher price for their protein?  Many times people are too comfortable with their own box to think outside of it. That is the double-edge sword of being visionary.

        From Mark Ramsey:    Most folks have never heard of the term "blog," now you have to figure out what a "plog" is.  A "plog" is a personalized blog. It's an invention of Amazon.com.  Which brings me to my main point, and this is the last time I'm going to harp on this.  If you have an entertainment-based morning show, you must must must have them create blogs. Why?   1. Because it's a way to open a dialogue with your listeners which drives them to your website and ricochets them back to the station.  2. Because blog posts are informative little advertisements for your morning show which listeners will subscribe to or email to each other.  3. Because it gives listeners - and the on-air folks - something to talk about, thus spreading word of mouth.   4. Because listeners can respond to posts and engage the talent in a way that's otherwise impractical or impossible.   5. And finally, because it's bound to help your ratings.  It works for FOX NEWS's Greta Van Susteren, it can work for you, too.

        Tom Asacker points out that we are what we consume...At least when it comes to brand identity.  Think about the products you use to unconsciously build your identity.  Anyone who knows me is well aware of my affinity to Ralph Lauren Polo products. What about the other things you use and consume throughout the day?  (He makes some very interesting observations!)  How can you use this brand identity to tie into your station's product and how the consumer feels about themselves?  A truly loyal listener is one that is "connected" with the station and passionate about their favorite radio station.    Yesterday, while enjoying the holiday at a friend's home, something struck me. Most of the day was spent by the pool, so our host insisted that we not bring glass containers onto the patio area. Any way, while pouring my Magic Hat (Beer) into a generic plastic cup, I was suddenly roused by a strange loss of identity.   I know, it was only a beer. But by removing it from its package, its nuance disappeared. And so did the meaning that I had made for myself (its brand) when I chose it from the plethora of beverages in the fridge. And with the loss of my identity, its value dropped precipitously. Perhaps Magic Hat should offer branded plastic cups during the summer months to prevent just such an occurrence.  Now before you discount my insight, try this: Write down every brand of every product and service that you experience during a typical day. For example: When you roll out of bed record your brand of bed, linen, toothpaste, toothbrush, shoes, clothing, coffee, car, etc., etc., etc. It should be one hell of a long list.  Okay, if you dont believe these brands to be a part of your identity, email me your list and Ill post it for all to see. Here's what I suspect: I'll lay odds that you review the list to make sure that no one reads a brand that doesnt send the message that you want to send . . . about yourself. I look forward to your list. :-)

        Here's a follow-up on Mark Ramsey's recent idea about utilizing "#1" language into the mix and WHY you would want to...     I've gotten some feedback on the piece I did suggesting you use the phrase "Arbitron-rated #1" or some such language as appropriate on your air.  Here's the essence of the feedback:  - Some psychologists think too much #1 will turn off listeners - So many stations are using this phrase it's now a cliche - This sounds like an empty claim, lacking in credibility  My response:  Nowhere in the strategic rule book does it say that you MUST use the specific phrase "Arbitron-Rated #1." This is industry jargon that we have all assumed to be sacrosanct. Even Arbitron tells me that you can use any language you want so long as it expresses the ratings truth and in no way suggests what folks should do in the future. So I say, use whatever words you want. But get two things across: The word "Arbitron" and the idea that you are the leader in some meaningful area.  Second, while some folks get off on zigging when the rest of the world is zagging, that's not how most folks behave. And while it's true that Avis made a lot of headway by saying "#2 tries harder" what Avis really did was guarantee it would forever be #2. And I don't know any radio stations that are content with that ranking if #1 is within reach.  No claim sounds empty if it's supported by Arbitron's facts. And that's the big difference here.  Granted most folks don't know who Arbitron is, but we're not doing this for "most folks." We're doing it for the folks who get the diaries. And they know EXACTLY who Arbitron is.  Finally, if more than one station in a market is using phrases like this, it doesn't mean you should necessarily avoid it. Don't forget that your air speaks to your audience - especially your heavy audience - most. Nobody else in the market can say that. Let them work over their audience - you work over yours.  End of rant.

        Here's another No-Nonsense Marketing Smart Tip from Mark Ramsey at Mercury Research.  Certainly something to think about...    You've heard stations use the phrase "Arbitron-Rated #1," haven't you? Thanks to a loophole in the official rules, you can indeed use the "A" word on your air as long as you do so carefully and factually and without intentionally or accidentally biasing diarykeepers in current or future surveys. So why don't more stations use language like this? Beats me. They should.   Why use the "A" word on the air?   Arbitron tells me the "A" word used on air doesn't bias the ratings process when presented in reference to the prior results of the survey - as long as there's no discussion of methodology or encouragement to participate. That means, within constraints, it's legal.   But can you really gain no advantage by using the term "Arbitron" on air? The phrase "Arbitron-rated #1" connects the word "Arbitron" to the word "ratings" and everyone understands what ratings are. Thus anyone who has an Arbitron diary knows how important his or her "vote" now is. Hearing that the majority of diary recipients vote for Station X could conceivably have a subtle but powerful psychological effect on listeners.   It's the Principle of Social Proof   Psychologist Robert Cialdini has written extensively on the importance of "Social Proof." In essence, it means that we see behavior as "correct" in any given situation because we see others behaving that same way. It's why you can't forget to put out the trash on trash day - because all your neighbors put out THEIR trash. What kind of computer should I buy? Let's see what my friends are using and ask them. We don't check Consumer Reports, we check to see who's number one.   This is why it pays to be "the leading" or "#1" in any category. Leadership suggests performance and provides security and confidence. That which is most popular must be popular for a reason. Everyone else is doing it, so it must be the right thing to do.   It's the Power of Suggestion   The repeated mention of the phrase "Arbitron-Rated #1" educates listeners. And when they get a diary they will know how their peers have voted. And that's when the principle of social proof kicks in. Do I follow or fight? Others who get these diaries rate this station #1. Everyone else is doing it, shouldn't I?   This doesn't mean listenership is faked. But it is a subtle psychological technique that can move listeners minds, behavior, and recall in your station's direction and give your station more of the credit it deserves. If you can find a daypart or demo or format to be "Arbitron-rated #1" in, then think about proclaiming it. Just stay on the legal side of that fine line and don't lie - you WILL be found out.

        I can truly say that I've experienced this phenomenon numerous times over the past few years.  In Nashville, the more money we spent, the better the programming, the worse the ratings dropped.  The less we did and the worse we felt about how things were going...the better the ratings.  It was freaky!  This comes from Mark Ramsey at Mercury Research:    Why does all the best music research in the world not make you the best radio station in the world?  Could it be that the more perfect you get, the less attractive you become?  Consider movies: It's the flawed hero that moves us most. Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man is a bookish nerd with marginal social skills. His limitations are what allow us to connect with him.  What are your station's "edges"? Why are you intent on smoothing them out?  This is one of the key reasons I'm against the so-called "granular" interpretation of Arbitron ratings data - either from diaries or meters. "Granular" doesn't equal "great."  The point's well made in a recent article in  Ageless Marketing.

      While trolling through tompeters.com, I stumbled upon a summary presentation encapsulating the ideas contained in  Re-imagine.   Great stuff - the best primer on Re-Imagine I've found yet.  **********************  Re-imagine! Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age      ONE   It is the foremost task —and responsibility— of our generation to re-imagine our enterprises and institutions, public and private.

        Building "PASSION" starts simply...but thinks BIG.  A reminder from Dan Pallotta's newsletter:    One does not need a great idea to create great change in this world. One does not need to be affiliated with a prestigious organization. One does not need to invent the next moveon.org or the next AIDSRide. Martin Luther King used nothing but the strength of his person to create a movement. He didn't have a clever name or slogan. He had no internet. He had no database. He had no media fund. Gandhi the same. Lech Walesa. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Caesar Chavez. Helen Keller. They didn't have websites. Yet look how much more they moved the world than we seem able with all our technology.  It is your conviction and your fire and your heat that has the power to transform. What is it that I care about? What is it that I can begin to do about it? Who can I talk to? How can I use my vocal chords? These are the important questions. What did I remain silent about today that I will not be silent about tomorrow? What paper can I write to? What person can I register to vote? And what person can I ask that person to register to vote?

        From Paul Williams BRAND AUTOPSY blog...good advice about utilizing the amazing brain power from employees, co-workers, family and friends:    I’m seventy pages into  Ideas Are Free  and I’m enamored with all I have read. After reading  Free Prize Inside  and learning how Seth Godin views soft innovations (small ideas) as a catalyst for making things happen, I have found Ideas Are Free to be an advanced course in Free Prize-ology.   The authors of  Ideas Are Free , Alan Robinson and Dean Schroeder, make a compelling case for how employee-generated ideas enable a company to experience transformative change and enduring success.  Notable passages from the initial seventy pages include:   Ideas are free . Employees become allies in solving problems, spotting opportunities, and moving the company forward, to the benefit of all. And when managers decide to let their employees think alongside them – and no longer seek to go it alone – they will have joined the Idea Revolution.  This empowerment starts a virtuous cycle. As employees see their ideas being used, they begin to feel valued as part of the team and become more involved.  Small ideas are the best source of big ideas. A big problem or opportunity frequently manifests itself through a host of smaller signs or symptoms, each of which might be seen individually by different people in different places at different times. What might seem to be a small idea could in fact be addressing a facet of this larger issue. This bigger issue can often be discovered by probing with the right questions.  Small ideas tend to stay proprietary, since there are no mechanisms for competitors to find out about them, and even if they do, the ideas are often situation-specific and so cannot be copied. Because of their proprietary nature, they accumulate into a considerable cushion of sustainable competitive advantage.   In case you are wondering what my Dog-Ear Score is so far … it’s 21.4%. Yep, I’ve dog-eared 15 of the first 70 pages. That’s a fast pace to start any book.

      Here are some on-air fundamentals to review with new talent or as a refresher course  -- DJ School 101.  1.  Credibility is everything…keep it real . The most important quality to cutting through the clutter and succeeding today is to develop a trusting relationship with listeners. They must perceive that you tell the truth, that you tell it like it really is. “Jocking” or announcing is formula. It is being on automatic pilot without any feeling or emotion. Feeling it involves intention and emotion. No feeling, no emotion, no intention equals no communication. Even “coming up next” can either be read or communicated with meaning.  2.  Finding your voice, your ‘Comic Perspective’ … Arbitron is still a game of memory and recall. Break-through talents combine credibility with strong characterization, which means expressing yourself with your own vision of the world around you and establishing the essence of your relatability; to people listening who either are like you or your opposite.  Some examples include:   Observational   Everyman (normal guy/woman with wacked out people around    him/her)   People pleaser   Cynic   Perennially single female  3.  The secret to mastering any performance skill is not trying too hard . Trying too hard usually means thinking too much about what you’re doing during performance. The time to think is when you’re planning the show before you go on the air and during songs and commercials. While you’re on the air be alert and completely in the moment. Being a great listener is a major part of being aware and being focused in the present moment.  4.  Prep. Prep. Prep . Highly revered basketball coach John Wooden said it best, “Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.” Avoid reading or memorizing. Master the material with the goal being spontaneity and sincerity.   5.  Pay attention to what’s important . Distractions keep talent from being in the moment and focused on the message, caller or break. Instant Messaging, request lines, sales people, and friends in the studio are just some of the distractions that will keep talent from connecting with listeners.  6.  Know the selling priorities . For example with promotions, in a Justin Timberlake contest that involved giving away his CD and a trip to see him perform live in Miami, the trip is obviously the most enticing part of the giveaway to listeners.   The following is a useful guide to use:   Attention   Think from the listeners perspective and lead with the biggest listener benefit, a headline or hook to get their attention. Using the example above: “Wanna fly to Miami to see Justin Timberlake?”     Interest   Make it enticing, alluring to capture their interest…”South Beach, stars, hot babes & hot guys and see the hottest Pop performer today!”     Detail   Use only bottom line, need-to-know information on live sells leaving details to produced promos. ”When you hear a Justin Timberlake song call to win his CD and a shot at the Miami Fly Away, we’ll tell you all about in just a few minutes on KISS FM.    Action   Urge them to take action…”Listen for Justin Timberlake’s new song in the next 20 minutes to win a trip to South Beach....”  7.  Sell the call letters/station name with pride and enthusiasm and say them a lot.  Say the station calls/name often as you can work it in to conversation and to make it stand out. Look for new and different ways to highlight the station/name. It’s been proven in Arbitron over and over that the stations with the most name mentions tend to have higher recall and therefore cume.  8.  Focus on getting more TSL . The best talent are focused on ONE mission --stretching TSL. Talent can press the flesh to build cume, but on air there is really only one thing they can do to increase ratings: convince that moment’s audience to keep listening or tune in again another time. Lead with something great that will get listener’s attention and keep them listening, or tease upcoming content to generate another listening occasion.  9.  Talking in music sweeps : make a song-to-song segue by hitting the second song at full volume, let it establish for approximately one second, and then talk over the song intro. The exception to this guideline would be with cold/no intro songs, and then it is acceptable to talk on the back fade of the song quickly. Avoid ‘bridging two songs’, where the jock starts talking on the fade of one song and then starts the second song under the rap. Forward momentum and energy is increased when you hit the next song and deliver your quick message.  Note: It is important to totally respect the music in some formats where its policy not to talk over the music at all. If there is any talk in music sweeps it’s done between songs.  10.  Avoid letting songs fade too long . Take the song out at the point that the song starts to fade, in other words, before there is any noticeable fade on the air. Hit the next song at slightly higher volume and pull the previous song volume down. Of course you don’t want to cut the song in the middle of a word, which would make it obvious to listeners, but you can exit on the end of a refrain or phrase while the song is still hot.  11.  Avoid talking over any vocals on song intros . It sounds fine to talk between any vocal intros, as long as it’s not vocal-over-vocal. And remember the cardinal rule of good delivery: just because it’s a 60 second lip, doesn’t mean you HAVE to chatter for 60 seconds.  12.  Focus on one main thought/theme per talk break . By doing this you increase the chance of your message or content being remembered by listeners. The typical listener is listening with something less than 20% of their consciousness. To have a chance at delivering a message that gets through, it needs to be focused on one important thing they care about. Multiple thought breaks and laundry lists of upcoming content obscure the important message and detract from memorability.  13.  Pot up low level intros all the way to full volume so there is no drop on the air.  Keeping the audio levels consistent is good for TSL. Constantly changing audio levels is annoying and a cause of tune-out.   14.  The voice-to-music ratio when talking over song intros should be similar to that of a lead singer’s voice in a song . Listeners will ideally hear the voice being slightly dominant over the music, yet both clearly audible -- you don’t want to be buried by the music nor have the voice to be so dominant that it obscures the music. The exact right place to be in the music and your distance from the microphone are two variables to play with. Listen to tapes of your show with different settings and see how it sounds without headphones on. Headphones can make things sound very different from car speakers in rush hour.  15.  Make music beds repetitive and consistent without a lot of distracting musical changes.  Avoid horns and vocals. The main purpose of using beds is to lift the energy level of conversations and fill in dead spaces. Listeners shouldn’t notice beds unless they’re used for staging to get listeners’ attention.  16.  Be quick- but don’t hurry . There’s a difference between being efficient and succinct and rushing through conversations. If you hurry, you’re more likely to make mistakes, but if you’re not quick, you won’t get things done and you will bore your listener. The bottom line is to be a good self-editor. This is particularly important for set ups. The set up to any bit, interview, feature, etc. is critical to its success.  17.  Set Ups : Clearly and enthusiastically set up a feature, bit or conversation to get listeners’ attention and pique their interest. Listeners make a mental decision on whether to listen to something after the first sentence of introduction.  18.  Exits:  Don’t miss the exit on the freeway -- remember to get out at an impact point. Develop a sense for when to end a conversation, bit, etc. Leave the listeners on a high note with something strong and memorable.  19.  Branding.  Get ownership of your content by attaching the station and/or show name to all features. Creative and entertaining produced intros and outros help you brand content.  20.  Teasing.  Teasing upcoming content is the absolute best way to fuel TSL. This also adds to people feeling like they’re going to miss something if they don’t listen every day or listen longer. TV entertainment shows and newscasts have made an absolute science out of enticing billboarding and teasing to create momentum and build longer viewing. They devote 25% of content time to previewing! Talent who ‘get’ the art of teasing will consistently outperform talent who don’t.

       From Mark Ramsey's radio BLOG:  There are plenty of ways that an air talent or programmer can take your listener "backstage"...anybody have any creative ideas to share?      It constantly amazes me how rarely we "lift the curtain" and take listeners backstage.  There are so many ways to do this, from literally inviting fans to tour the station to launching online-only initiatives designed to give listeners a feel for what happens between the morning show bits.   urlLink Here is an example  of how HBO's Six Feet Under does this so successfully - they actually take you inside a production meeting. (Thanks to  urlLink Creating Customer Evangelists  for the link)  Don't you have music meetings, Radio? Don't you have Morning Show meetings? Don't you have writing sessions? Aren't these the kinds of things that could build relationships with your audience?  Does anyone out there KNOW these things exist?  Do you care? Because your listeners probably do.
