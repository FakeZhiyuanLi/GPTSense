      Chemistry "class" just ended early, it is now officially spring break for my online school. But the break doesn't line up with our Italy trip... so I have to work ahead. Bleh. Class was boring as usual, the teacher just went over what we read in the textbook, so during the time I read all of Katha's blog, including one of those gazillion question quizzes. It must've asked "are you gay?" a hundred times.  I had my lesson this morning, it went pretty well except for the fact that the new pianist couldn't read Beethoven's Spring violin sonata. I don't blame her, the piano part is like a concerto, just much more transparent. Anyhow, Alice probably won't hire her. After my lesson I feel like I can do anything, the weekend is here and there's nothing stopping me from doing anything I want. Then Thursday shows up again and I've only practiced like.. 3 hours all week. I guess I haven't wanted to be a musician that badly. Maybe I do, but these are the years where you can't mess around. Anyway...  It's rather unorganized right now, but it sounds like some people from the RPYO group might go to Suzannah (opera) tonight. I heard that my neighboor's daughter made the set or something, so my parents are being goody-goody neighboors and going to show their support. I should call up various people and see what we're doing.

      As I was waiting outside of Eastman I heard some guy talking to another in a loud, know-it-all voice: "I really want to learn about Asian culture. I mean, come on, corporate America is trying to americanize Asia." True. But also: 1. This guy was a dumbass, you had to be there 2. America IS corporate, sure there's bad people in high places, but the root of America lies in the fact that people work for themselves, therefore forming businesses. Some would call this capitalism. Hence, a corporate America. 3. Asians don't have to go to McDonalds. The communists aren't shoving French (oh, freedom, sorry) Fries down their throats. 4. This guy thought he was cool cause he was hanging around Eastman/Java's. Hope he gets hit up by a beggar. That's what he wants, no corporate America, just lots of people begging for stuff. No corporate America, but he definately wants money to be cool and hang around Java's.  rrrr.

      My audition for the string orchestra concerto went pretty well I thought. The piece isn't that hard, and I've only practiced it a total of 4 days or so, but I had a lesson on it a few weeks ago which was good. Its also short. You realise how short it is when you actually audition. I'm not getting as nervous as I used to, I'm getting out of the teenager anxiety stage.  Madama Butterfly is so beautiful. My view of music was so messed up when I was younger. I would have called something like Madama Butterfly or somehting from an even earlier period "modern". I thought the Mendelsohn String Octet was modern the first time I heard it. It was actually lots of Eastman professors, including Ilya Kaler as first violin. Eastman should get him back. Anyway, now I think Wagner's operas are modern. I think I'm correct in assuming that. Of course, I thought I was correct before too.  Oh, I think I'm one of the "winners" for the "competition", because the director asked if he could borrow my score I got from Sibley. I hope Maeve got picked, because she's awesome, and if not her.. who? Not Addison, I beg of you.  Uh, track 5 first act, Madama Butterfly, heart breaks open on floor...

      I don't even know why my Meave/Michael/Ian/Noah quartet exists. It serves no purpose except to fulfill Alice's ego and give Jeff money. We suck, and I'm hoping to drop it next year. Also, I need to find a new violin teacher. Alice suggested switching about 6 months ago because she thought it was time. She's good, but too nice. And I know her more like a good friend, which can be good, but it just deteriorates the lessons. Some choices are... David Brickman, maybe Katha's teacher, Boris, and Alice has some Russian lady at her school who she wants me to try. She does seem good, but is new to teaching, and Alice probably just wants me to stay at Kanack. Besides that, I have German homework due tomorrow. Ansel and the German teacher are coming here at 7:30. That's early. For me. Tomorrow we have auditions for concertos at the notoriously bad Eastman Fellowship Ensemble. I think that's what its called. Even the name is notoriously bad. I'm playing Hindemith Trauermusik (Music of Mourning). Its really beautiful but modern, so the judges, whoever they may be, won't like it as much as say... Addison's Bach or whatever noise he is blasting out now. Bach isn't noise, Addison is. Just clarifying. Anyway, German.

      I was talking to Maeve (because the chamber orchestra from hell was cancelled) about gays/bisexuals/anybody who isn't straight. Not that this isn't common knowledge but we thought about 90% want attention and possibly the 10% really are different. Oh whoops, I don't think saying "different" is PC. It would be interesting to talk to somebody who was actually gay without them being all in your face about it. Meaning its a natural thing to them so they're cool with talking about it. I would imagine it would be hard to talk to anybody about it though. Especially in today's society with it being such a big issue, everybody's afraid of "finding out". But no, you don't "find out". It seems if someone was really gay, they'd know from whenever a romantic notion first appeared inside their mind.   Blogs like mine are different. Meaning... I'm the only one who reads it. Bastards.  Oh I just remembered. Bobby Fisher hates  urlLink Jews . What a nut. He invented his own version of chess where you can't plan out your beginning cause there's lots of different ways of starting. Fischer Random Chess. At least get a good name for it, Bobby.

      I'm surprised that I keep coming back to post on my blog. Usually I run out of steam after say... one or two posts, each not more than three sentences in length. So I'm leaving for Italy in two days. I got some Euros (cash). They're cool, the more the bill is worth the greater its actual physical size, and vice-versa. We stopped at B&N and I bought Itzhak Perlman/Pinchas Zukerman playing Bach. Sean let me borrow the CD, and its awesome, so I bought it. Now all Sean and I have to do is dually make Katha like it. Oh and I got Perlman playing the Barber concerto. After the first time through, its one of my favorite concertos. Enough crap. Tch√ºs! Oh, anime is filled with girls in skimpy clothes. Even the girl heroes with.. "dignity". As much dignity as a whore I guess.

      I haven't been to the mall for a long time, but today we had to go to lots of random stores to get random crap for Italy (good crap, mind you). Everybody in the mall is so depressing, especially the Easter bunny and every person who walks into Abercrombie. Everywhere you look there's some smiling blonde staring at you. Not to mention all of the jewelry stores. Everybody is the same. Anyway, we also stopped at the bank and I deposited all of my money, not much, into a savings account, so now I'll have an ATM card with which I can deposit and withdraw money. Cool, hopefully the card will get here by the time we leave for Italy. Hm I also got a Messenger bag so I can have a carry on to the plane and not get ripped off in Italy, and one of those little dollar store quality necklace wallets for like.. 10 bucks. I think its exactly the same one that our chaperone has, how embarrasing. Anyway, math... Chapter 13 "Further work with trigonometry". Great.

      Personal blogs can be one of two things: good or bad. An example of the latter would be mine, of the former, Tina's blog. I like how blogs can reveal things about people you could have never seen before. Its a little dangerous too. Anyway, Tina's latest post has been the biggest motivation not to be a typical American teenage lazy-ass in quite a while. Also, it compelled me to comment on the death penalty.  In general, justice done by death makes me feel uncomfortable. Say the person actually did kill somebody. That person has destroyed an opportunity for something good, so should the justice system just assume that the killer's only "purpose" in life is destruction and that he/she can never accomplish anything good? Say the system decides to try and turn that person around (psychological help, etc...), is the public socially responsible for whatever resources that are needed to help change that person? My conclusion comes from my inability to answer any of these questions. Because nobody can place any distinct value on any person's life, no one can judge whether or not someone should be killed for an equivalent act. Its hard to come up with an alternative solution. Life in prison doesn't seem much better, although at least you have time to think. Its probably impossible to design a program that can test a person's readiness to reenter the world. ERg, something as basic as a system of government becomes way too complicated way too quickly.

      Correction: Saint-Saens (see two lines down for the mega(stephen)-cooler spelling)  Saint-Caens organ symphony, mmmm. I got back at from a quartet concert about an hour ago. We played the first two movements of Shostakovich No.8. We would've had the whole thing learned by now, but there was Italy. And with Italy came Boccherini. If his name is spelled wrong, well... I don't care too much for him anyway. Stephen's brother recorded the concert. There's only one spot where we messed up really badly, and I'm not sure how bad we messed up... its hard to tell when the speed of your bow exceeds the velocity of a car flying down the freeway. Ian's at his RPYO audition, he's probably finishing right about now. I hope he gets in, he sounds a ton better than he did before we went to Florida. I'm going to do two lab reports and a test on reaction rates, and then Ilya's Encore. Too bad Tina can't come, I hope Arthur joins us.  Florida was decent, call me if you're interested... although it was rather uninteresting. Ha, haha.  **NoAh*** lol

      Quartet rehearsal was decent, we stood up and played for a while (except emily, the cellist). Then my dad and I stayed around waiting.. basically cause there was nothing else to do. Talked to Katha about random stuff, can't remember really. 5 minute showers at meadowmount and other camps were the topic of interest. On the way to pick up my sister my dad goes... Dad:"So you want to do it this afternoon?" I was rather shocked, this is my father after all. Noah:"Do what?" Dad:"You know.. it!" At this point I'm contemplating how much force I'd have to exert to break through the window and after that land softly on the expressway going 70 mph... Noah:"What is 'it'?" Dad:"You know..." Noah starts reaching to unbuckle his seatbelt. At this point I didn't care HOW I landed on the expressway. Noah:"What's 'IT'?" Dad:"Get an electric guitar."   My dad has been wanting to get one for years. My mom isn't too happy with the idea so as a consequence I guess my dad resorted to calling the action of "getting a guitar", "doing it". An electric guitar would be fun though... I could get a pick-up for the mandolin and put distortion on it... crazy. Shostakovich on a distorted mandolin. Can't beat that.

      I need a substitute for sleep. Homework, you suck. I was looking at this book on amazon called "The Final Theory". It claims to disprove all current theories and state the unifying theory. Although the author calls it "the theory of everything"... even the name for the theory sucks. And what a load of shit. If somebody had actually found a unifying theory, it'd be the front page of every blog, newspaper, and website all around the globe. Nice try, bud.

We didn't really want to hire her (my mom enjoyed looking on as she forced her 3 child-slaves to vacuum the rugs)... but we did anyway. So she comes every Saturday morning and I'm always woken up by her ringing the doorbell. I have to pile all the crap in my room onto my bed.

      One of the previews before Shrek 2 was for Harry Potter. The movie got a new director (and a new Dumbledore). It looks so much better than the other two. Meaning... darker, more depressing, and Harry has finished going through puberty. Basically, they are trying to make it not so kiddy and more full of substance. I'm not sure how much intellectual stimulation can be pumped into the movie... the books don't seem to offer much. Or maybe I'm just blind.

      Dear Lai, who are you?  Moving on... On Saturday we (when I say "we" it will most likely refer to RPYO people, unless the context suggests another meaning. Yes, it's that bad.) were walking through the park and somehow the Draft came up. The proposed draft states that men and women will be called upon, that college won't keep you safe, and that Canada is no longer a refuge. Arthur is in favor of both men and women being drafted, although not of the draft itself (I think). A draft that doesn't discriminate is attractive, especially when it comes to women's rights. Basic example: Want to vote? Then fight.  My English teacher from school once said, "The women are the mothers, and the men are the defenders." Probably many, especially liberal America, would disagree. I'd tend to agree more with her than with Arthur, and it brings up some important points. I haven't read the whole draft proposal but there's no way they would take a mother and father of the same family. Or even just one parent.. Imagine a working father with his wife gone and having no time to take care of his children. Again, I'm not sure what the proposal says. Also, when someone goes to fight for his country, what is he (or possibly she) really fighting for? Bush? The Glory of America? Oil? I doubt it. His family. Something you can identify with and love. Once you take both sexes into battle the whole atmosphere may change. I'm sure in war people "forget" some of their... Loyalties back at home (many from WWII admit it), because people need escapes in that kind of situation. In general I also think men have an urge to protect the women around them, no matter who they are. In any case, there are many different opinions, and none of them are valid until a draft like they are proposing is actually put into action.   Maybe Arthur is right. A bisexual draft seems inevitable anyway. Better sooner than later.  Good blog:  urlLink The Mesopotamian

       urlLink 800CEOREAD Blog: BOOK REVIEW: Corporate Religion  Most business blogs are almost solely comprised of links to other blogs mixed in with occaisonal  content . What usually happens is one person will post a decent article and everybody else decides to link to that post in their blogs. I guess all the yuppy entrepreneurs don't like to have their genious innovative abilities taxed on a real blog of their own.  Seeing as its a fad, I decided to jump aboard the link train with this post. You may argue that this is not correct, because I'm usually not regarded as an innovative genious. Therefore I cannot theoritcally become a member of this fad, or... elite "link-group", if you will. But hey, why not at least try and fit in with the preps? The worst that can happen is nobody will ever read my blog..  Shut up.  Quoted from 800CEOREAD:  The whole premise of his book is based on the work psychologist Alfred Alder. Alder believed human personality was formed at the intersection of three conditions:      * the you as others see you     * the you as you see yourself     * the you as you would like to be seen   From the book:      According to Alder, the more these three views harmonize, the stronger one's personality becomes. And with a harmonious personality, there is a corresponding diminution of inner conflicts and misunderstandings between the outside world and the individual.    Originally I was tempted to disagree and add another dimension: * the you  But as I read that last bit over a few times I realised that the idea was that the intersection, or harmonization of the three aspects formed "the you". After all, we live in a world of perception.  (I notice Machiavelli in the distance, old but determined. He is climbing a hill and he reaches the top. He wheezes his last wheez and laughs his last triumphant laugh. I turn back to my computer damning the old bastard as he dies on the hill.)  Maybe I've got it. Or Alder is all wrong, in which case I'm wrong too... I think. That's the problem with philosophy, you can't prove a damn thing... I think.
