						   Well, tomorrow I go to Mexico. I'm getting more excited every minute. I have been soooo blessed. Just a little over a week ago I wasn't even close to having the amount I needed to go. I cried out to God, I didn't know what I was going to do. And even though I didn't give the Lord all the love he is worthy of, he answered my call. I can't tell you enough how great God is. As of this morning I was $100 over what I needed to raise. God is so good. He has given me so many chances, so many oppurtunities. I will strive to be the man He wants me to be. Please pray for me while I'm in Mexico. Pray that I have wisdom, courage, and pray that I do what God wants me to. Pray that I hold my tongue when everyone's tired and the tensions are high. Ok then, i guess I'll go do stuff. God Bless you!!

						   Well, I am now back from Alive. Which really helped me by the way. I got to see Relient K again. But garsh durn em... they weren't signing again. Mercy Me was awesome, and Thousand Foot Krutch is now one of my favorite bands. Alive was sooooo ridiculously muddy though. I got home and took a long shower. It was awesome. My brother John came home for a couple weeks. His kids are here...wow. They are...well...monsters. Whew. Yeah, but, anyhoo, yeah. My photo I.D came in while I was at Alive. So that's good. I started segment 2 today for drivers training. I am soo glad it's only 3 days. I think I may have raised all my money for Mexico. I think. Cuz if not, grrr... Yeah, I leave Thursday and I really hope to have just half a bored day before that. But I'm not seeing that happening. Well, I guess I summed up everything that's going on in, like, June. So, I'll see everyone later!

						   Well, I almost have all my Mexico money. So thats good. I worked alot shoveling poop today and got sunburnt. I got all these bumps on me, and I hope they're just a reaction to pine. They're getting bigger and are kinda gross. And they itch pretty good too. And I have a couple more truck loads to do tomorrow. Yeah, and my face, arms, and neck are burnt. But ya know, I just feel so happy to be recieving all these blessings that make it possible for me to go to Mexico with a GREAT group of people! God always provides. Even if it is through a huge pile of crap :) And Alive is in 2 days!!! I just can't wait. Oh, with the I.D. thing, my mom called the High School and explained the situation. So they made me up a picture ID! So that's all set, just need to go pick it up. So even though I feel like crap, I won't let that get me down:) Oh, and about that pray for me thing, I still need prayers. Working really helps though, takes my mind off it. But Alive and Mexico will do amazing things for me. HAVE A GREAT SUMMER ALL!!! Don't let anything get you down. Just cry out to God and he WILL answer, he's always there when you need Him. GOD BLESS!!!!

						   Wow. So last week I had zero jobs to do and I had no idea how I was gonna raise all my money. Now I have too many jobs to do and hardly any free time. Gyaaa!!!!! I have a photo I.D. now, and we got it in a couple hours from the school, but we still have to pick it up. I got a tetnis shot today. I was really disappointed. I was getting ready for it to hurt when she took the cap off the needle. I felt some pain, almost said ow, but before I could, she was done, it was not what I expected at all. But now my arm kinda hurts, I think rigamortus is setting in (I know I spelled the wrong) But yeah, about the jobs, I have to trim hedges tonight, shovel poop for, like, prolly 2 days, and I think Ron Kopacz wants me to work for him more. Which I don't really want to, cuz farming work is HARD! And it ruins pants. So everything is gonna work out great for Mexico! God will always provide, I felt so desperate just a few days ago, and now the blessings are killin' me. God giving me so many oppurtunities and blessings that I can't take it anymore. I won't have to give up TFC's. And my parents aren't just giving me money either, I prolly work harder for them than any other jobs I'm gonna have. I worked at the Dekams yesterday, that sucked. I got some chemicals on my skin and  have, like, little holes or somethin in my fingers and stuff now. It burned at first. I saw Troy yesterday, it was real good. I'm real disappointed in Orlando though. He was such a wuss. Brad was awesome though. I'm hoping to see Shrek 2 sometime, that'd be real cool. Ok then, thanks to anyone who might read this that prayed for me. It really worked!! 5 MORE DAYS TILL ALIVE!!!! YAY!!!!!!!

						   Well, I just told about how I hate life a few hours ago. Well, I prayed, and what a quick answer to prayer! I just got 2 more job offers in, like, 2 hours. And one of the jobs will pay $100!! And then with the I.D. thing, it will most likely be in before I leave, but if not, I think Brett Lester could help me out somehow and everything will be fine. The only thing I really need to worry about is math tomorrow, and I think I'm real ready for it, but I'm still gonna study some more tonight. But yeah, I felt so hopeless not too long ago, and now I just KNOW everything is gonna be great. I feel sooooo much better now. 8 MORE DAYS!!!! I can't wait till ALive!!! Alrighty then!!!! HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!!!! GOD BLESS!!!!!

						   Yeah, so I went to the secretary of States office today to get a photo I.D. I guess my mom and I were thinking it would be real quick. We found out that it takes 2-3 weeks. I really hope it's quicker, because I can't go to Mexico without it, and I leave in 15 days. I also have to get a tetnis shot to be able to go, so I have to find sometime to fit that in. I think I did good on the exams, so that's good, and now I have 1 more chance to redeem myself in math or else I'll get a real bad grade. I'm nowhere near having enough money for Mexico, and I don't want my parents to pay my way. I'm ridiculously tired because I didn't get to sleep till 1:30 this morning. I laid there for over 2 hours. I don't know what I'll do if I can't go to Mexico, I've sacrificed so many other things so I could go. That stupid I.D. thing makes me wanna kill myself. So I would just really appreciate your prayers if you think of me, because I just don't know how everything is gonna end up. I think I'm kind of dreading summer vacation because eveythings so hectic. This would be the best time ever to be raptured. Alrighty then, sorry everything is just about how my life sucks. But it's all that's really on my mind right now. Ok, write more later..... God Bless

						   I am so freakin excited about summer! I'm real nervous about exams though. My two hardest classes and I have to take the exams :( Math and Bio stink real bad. I still have no idea how I'm gonna raise the money to go to Mexico. Well, I know my parents will pay for it, but I don't want them to. Durn Mexicans... always causing trouble. I can't wait for Alive though. 8 more days!! I really just feel like quitting right now. But I know I can't. I have to keep goin for 1 and a half more days. It's so hard though. GYAAAA!!!!!   I was talkin to Dave Filkins today. I LOVE THAT GUY!!! We talked drums for a while, then I came home... and played drums. I'm gonna play drums so much over the summer. Amanda, we gotta get together and jam. And tell David to come to the church and we'll have a drumfest.  Anyhoo, sorry to the people who don't like drums about that little tangant. But yeah, I really can't wait for summer. I'm actually not doing homework right now when I should be, but I still have time... Yeah, I guess I prolly should go get to it. Till next time!!!

						   It's almost here!!! I can't wait for summer. I'm real stressed about this month though. I'm scared about the exams because I really stink at taking tests, and I'm a long way from all the money I need for Mexico. I know I just need to give it up to God and it will all work out, but I don't know how. I hate how God always suprises me :)     I have so many friends that are Juniors. Yeah, they're all gonna be seniors next year. I think the end of next year will be the hardest of my 4 years of High School. Wow, this time next year I'll be real depressed. I'm so glad that I got to have 2 years with them though. They have all been so much help to me this year. Thank you soooooooooooooooooooo much Amanda for introducing me to the lunch table. I've made some of my bestest friends this year. Um.... I'd like to thank the acadamy, my parents, God, everyone who made this possible.... seriously though, I hate 2005.

						   My grandma and grandmpa's 50th anniversary was today. That's a real long time. There was a nice little program where all their kids came up talked about some of the good memories they had of their parents. It was real nice. My uncle Tom is in the army and is, like, a general er somethin. He's almost to the top, which is real cool. He's stationed in Korea but it worked out that he could come to the anniversary, so all the kids were there. But anyhoo, at the end of my uncle's little speech, he turned and saluted his dad, it was really cool, cuz my Grandpa was so proud. I heard that they might re-enstate the draft. I'm kinda scared because I don't know what I'd do if Stephen had to go. Paul can't because he had his kidney removed, and Johns already in the Air Force. Of course, I might have have to go too if all this is still going on in a few years.         I didn't take the test in Lasecki's, but it worked out good because I wasn't positive on a few things, so I'm taking it Wednesday. I'm doing a lot better with that thing I was struggling with. I just got 45 more $ for Mexico, but that's still not near enough. Ok, then...later.

						   Well, tomorrow I'm taking a re-take math test. Mr. Lasecki rocks!!! I don't know if anyone will read this in time, but if you do, please pray for me. This will determine whether I fail the class or pass with a decent grade. Also, I've really been struggling with something lately (which no one will ever know what) and I'm getting over it. But the struggle is still there, luckily I stopped it before it really got ahold of me. But if you could just pray for me I would greatly appreciate it. I'm going on a missions trip this month and I'm really having a hard time raising the money to go. I know I can go, but I might have to sacrifice TFC's for it. I know everythings gonna work out, but I don't know how. So prayer would really be appreciated. Ok then, enough of my problems. I guess I'll write more later. GOD BLESS!!!

I'll put things I've done in here and stuff, so if you read about something I may be struggling with, keep me accountable. Alrighty then. WRITE MORE LATER!!!
