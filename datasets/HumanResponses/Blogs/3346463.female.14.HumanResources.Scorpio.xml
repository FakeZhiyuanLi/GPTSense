      do you want to know what pisses me off? i hate when girls think they are fat, and i hate when people dont eat what they want because they think is will make them thin and they think all guys like thin. well you know what? i hate that, i realy do, first of all eat what you want, but dont pig out, second of all excersize but dotn do it religiously (lets not be sacreligous now). third, not all guys like thin girls. if you want a guy, the right one will like you on your personalty not on the size of your waist or chest(i sound like a teen magizine). think about it, all your doing is hurting your self when you go on diets, your not pleasing yourself, and if your not happy everyhting sucks. also, your setting your self up for failure, and i personaly dont like failure (i have failed at enough, i know what i am talking about). this entry is not directed to anyone at my school, its directed to another friend who refuses to let me help her. so i decided to blog all about her.   not-worried-about-her-figure spork...

PERSONS OF THE WHATEVER: TUCKER HUGHES and DOUGWARD TAMMANY  TUCKER: (this is for you pay close attention) tucker formaly know as drake. also - the guy i am dating, a totaly awesome person, as well as a great kisser, but no one needs to know that. a good dancer (when he agrees to dance), a person who overuses his right to pokey, amusing to sit on his lap, the guy i spent at least 28 hours on a moach with. blah*. tucker is an amazing cartoonist, is way, way ahead of everyones reading level, has a good taste in music, and owns a very bothersome game boy. by the way i think we need a name for the phobia for beign impaled by tree limbs.   DOUGWARD: dougward is the most slinkster cool person i have ever met, hes in love with his best friend, he is another amazing cartoonist and also has a very good taste in music. dougward is also a bass player and is extremly good at it (from what i have heard that is). dougward and i both are pack rats, tho he keeps EVERYTHNG and i only keep most things. dougward owns a few pictures that have great memories attached to them. like the snow falling pix and i think you have one from the time was saw tooth and claw (we'll have a  couple  bottles of wine) heh heh heh good times good times.  *cpoyright spork townsend 2004. not to be used without permission, under penalty of pokey.

      the first part of the title: there are just some things i cant post on the internet, for fear someone i know will actualy see it, and understand my vauge references. also i know if i mention somethings i risk losing more friends and i cant afford to do that.   the second part of the title: so i am goign to talk about things that make me happy, like the new CD and CD player i just got. i got the new incubus CD 'a crow left of the murder' the music, as normal, is not to great but the lyrics are umbelivable. brandon boyd is amazing. and my new CD player is like kyles and tuckers but mine is black and neon green. my favroite songs on this CD is "sick sad little world" and "beware! criminal"  ::cricket cricket::

      lots of people have people od the week, i like that idea. i am having a person of the week/day/month/hour or whenever the hell i feel like updating the blog.   PERSON OF THE (insret something here): CARSON LANGSTAFF i know its odd having carson as a person, saying i never realy liked him. tho carson was one of the only people who talked to me the day i visited and danced with me at the dance i visited. carson also sat with me and dougward almost every day when we had outside lunches. carson and me both have some off tendencies, we both blog at the same time, and we both clean our glasses at the same time too. in math class we squish each others heads its all very amusing.  thank god that person of the whatever is over. i hate talking about other people its so boring.

      this worries me, the whole eighth grade "love triangle" was annoying, so was "the love tree", and the emily combe kiss was stupid and so was the dance boat cruise. also the "as you like it" didnt help, and carson c. you making fun of me just made everything worse. my commencment speech went bad now didnt it? and carson l. you dotn have to tell everyone everything, a personal life is sometimes nice. the whole world dosent need to know about what making out sounds like. both carsons made everything worse so do the group good and drop off the face of the earth. by the way, the moment school ends the better. i cant wait to get away from the cursed school. but mabbie thats just me.   on to a new topic, i cant possibly be less gunker, i started the sterotype. dougie and me made it up for me. a gunker a goth + punk + skater + bad dresser = gunker. see no one else can be a gunker because no one else was called a bad dresser at pollys chapel. and for your information, i am not a wanna be gunker. i am not a gunker at all. i am just good at disguising my inner sterotype.   i wonder when the pool will open... Rachel,  do you rememebr when you all used to call me that. and when i spent all my outside lunches with dougie and carson l. we would all sit outside ms. shelhorns door and we would then go to the tralier, i miss the tralier. i think we should have a day when you all call me rachel not sporko. thatd be odd.

      i think youve all seen the other collective blog. i like it cept i think i am the only one who likes samurai better than ninjas. but whatever.   today was amusing, the commencment speech went well (this is a bad well ) dotn you think? i realy hope that i dotn have to go through saying that all over again. the 20th century went well (this is a good well) dotn you think? i liked it and i am so glad its over.   and now on to the one the only sporko (thats me), i am good for the most part cept i miss some of my friends from bucks rock. its very depressing thinking that i am never gonna see preston or scott again. tho i will probaly see aly and amber the next reunion. blah. if you havent noticed i got new glasses and i love them, not many people have commented on them tho. blah. well tommrow i am wearing my contacts so i wont have glasses for a day.   oogly boogly. thats my new phrase for tuckers stealing my blah and gus copyrighted blorg. so i got oolgy boogly, i think thats what ned flanders would sound like if he was on downers. it would be terribly amusing.   ::wave:: have a good life.  sporko

      My old blog wasn't working for me, since my internet had been taken away I somehow managed to forget my login and password. But handy dandy blogger told me that it was ok, all I needed was my email, when I first signed up for blogger I used my AOL, I haven't used it since. So I couldn't login to the AOL witch means I couldn't get at my login or password. Joy. So I started a new blog, if you had (or still have a link to my blog, please update it.) any way, what to say, its about 9:30 and I am bored as hell and I cant take it anymore (ah, reference humor) but I think I should be working on my evil 20th century, but I really don't want to. Well I think I shall go listen to some white stripes. For now, the one, the only the Spork.

      wow, that was amazing, that was deffitly the best feild with the best guys and the best equipment i have ever played on!!! let me tell you this, i was the only girl on the feild so i got ganged up on a few times. right so, the first few games we played, it was you get shot once your out. then we played a few games that were paint or pain. that is when you fill the hopper with as manny paintballs as you can and you go out in the feild for like 20 mins, when you get hit you dont get out, you keep playing and your out when youve either had enough and have been so hurt and covered with paint that you cant stand it anymore. or you get out when you run out of paintballs. it was amazing, i have a few realy bad hits, i got a few bare skin hits. i got a few on my wrist most on my torso. i got a few realy bad hits on the insides of my legs. the worst 3 i got were all my one guy, he got up close behind me (mabye 30 feet, your never supossed to shoot when your that close) he got me on the back of the neak, right on the bone. he got me where the clasp of my bra strap is, and right above my blet where some sikn was showing, it had to be the most painfull thing known to man. anyway enough of that.   -sporko-

      no, its not my sweet 16 (i have 2 years to go till that) its RJs sweet 16 today. RJ is my older brother, name written on his birth certificate: roger john hobbs. anyway, hes my brother and because everone is suppoded to get a car for their sweet 16, and the parental units arent getting him a car i got him a remote control something-or-other. he'll think its amusing (i hope).  anyway, since parental unit # 1 (dad) has a broken leg i am still stuck at hom taking care of him, you realy have no idea how hard that is. i truly cant think of whati did to deserve such harsh punishment (well i can think of a lot of things i did, but none the parental units know about, i hope they dont know). anyway in the next 2 weeks i will problay be dyign my hair blak and red (like i did last year). parental unit # 2 (mum) said i could, but she'd have to talk to parental unit # 1 (dad) first. i hope he says yes.  for now, the SPORKANATOR* and my SPORKMOBILE*  * copyright 2004 by spork townsend

      i meant to have tucker dougie and gabo over. but gabo was sick, and dougie lives like an hour away. so, i had tuck over, we went walking down by the river witch was fun, we wanted to go swimming but we couldnt find a place that wasent really really muddy. so we found an small island (that we jummped to get on to) of witch tucker claimed as his island. then we went to the movies and saw the day after tommrow, witch was ok i guess. we went to the mall then came home. we had fish and chips for dinner and my family, tucker and i played poker (with real money too) we spent half the time arguing on the rules of poker. i dotn belive my family played poker with tucker, wow. we then went walking (again) we went back to the island, then the parents of doom picked us up, it was slighty disturbing. tuck went home and i got online just to get in a fight with dougward, sorry dougie. and today i guess i am gonna do nothing, i think ill go swimmming (at the pool not the river) -sporko

      you have no fucking clue what i have to go through. my mum is in boston, but thats ok i guess. this morning at around 11 my dad says hes goign out and will be back. abotu 2 hour later he calls me from the ambulance telling me he fell, broke his ancle, and is headed for the hospital. around 3 a policeman nocks on my door. i am thinking "shit man, a policeman!" (i have this thng against police.) i open the door to see the policeman and my dad. my dad get in the house, he has no idea how to move with out one of his legs, if i had to do it when i was 8 he can do it too (long story of how i hurt my ancle and no one ever took me to the hospital i was forced to walk on a fucked up ancle for like a week untill i told the school nurse who fixed it realy quick) so he goes upstairs, for the last like 2 hours i have had to do whatever he wants me to do... like cook dinner/lunch of ::shudder:: chicken livers, then he wanted more food, then he wanted his ancle adjusted, then he wanted more food (how does anyone eat that much?) all this time i had almost constant phone calls from my mum and like telemarketers why do they pick the worst time to call me? i had to take care of my dad, its realy realy hard... and i havent gotton much thanks for it either. tho my mum called and told me she thanked me on his behalf, whatever. blah, most stresfull hours in a long time id say. whatever... sporko

      grr, i am realy mad at the moment realy truly mad. i had a good day tho, ted had practice and we all had fun, we even got some recording done. then i get home, and the day goes downhill form there and my dad is pressureing me to play chess with him (i realy hate chess as a game, i hate the fact that my dad, the chess master, has always beat me in about 14 moves then complains that i am not tryign hard enough) i say i realy dotn want to play chess right now, so he gats mad. my mum and older bro are in boston right now, witch means that the whole rest of the weekend is runined for me, i am stuck home with parental unit number 1.  joy. i get on the internet to see if anyone has anything to tell me, to see if anyone can cheer me up. no ones online, so i start looking at blogs, no updates on most of the blogs i look at... a few not so amusing updates on BofD, nothing new on dougies blog, a new update on tucks blog, eh just more about chinese girls in trucker hats and old girlfriends, not too out of the ordinary. i look at the blog of ted, people are asking if ted stands for tucker eric and dougie, it does, and i think we should add a few letters for matt v and me, sporko. buit then i rememebr that i am not a band member of ted untill i show them i have talent on drums (i havent played in years! i cant rememer anything!) so i have been nomited an offical groupie. again joy. so i think hey, my email, nothing bad can come of email... right? wrong... i get a cool email from dougie (not out of the ordinary) i get a lot of spam in my yahoo acount not my gmail acount, i also get a message from a good friend of mine tellign me that she hates me now because of one of my other posts, and that our friendship is over. you see why i am mad? do you get it? want to cheer me up? thanks a lot but there is nothing you can do to help me, dotn forget i am just another stupid gunker.

      this is an exact repeat of what on the blog of the damned. that was the best year i have ever had, and no i am not lying to you, i have never had a more meaningfull, fun, amazing, awesome, slinkster cool, time ever. and i know that a lot of you think that too, but i am just stating facts like i allways do. the best parts of the entire year: 1. the first day of school. 2. the first dance (when i met tucker). 3. the malvern dance (not the kiss). 4. the play. 5. the whole (yes whole) canada trip (moaches!) 6. graduation 7. getting hugs from everyone  8. knowing that i will never forget any of you or the stuff we went through, no matter how hard i try (ill only be trying to forget some things) 9. seeing every one together for the last time and loving everything about it all. thank you so much for all the wonderfull and not so wonderfull times we had, it was the most amazing year i have ever had and will stay the best danmmed year ever! -Rachel (AKA sporko)  p.s. in case you havent noticed its summer and its the first summer in 5 years that i havent gone to camp and i still dont know anyone in my neighborhood, so if i get seriously depressed this summer it would be awesome if you helped me.

      i love parties, the one last night was awesome, besides that it was choked with parent and teachers. the food was good, the music was too much for the parents and not enough for the kids, but the kid company was awesome. today we are goign to another party, this time its a pool party, that why i got the skipmy red bathing suit (look in the below post). i am so glad i have board shorts, i hate wearign things that show off my pale as hell legs, but whatever. the party will be fun i bet. as long as it stays realy nice outside. i need to do a person of the whatever, but i realy dotn want to do anymore typing so, next person of the whatever (probaly next post) will be gustopher.

      i never thought i would ever post something about the faliure of my mum at pickign out clothes for me. she took me to a T.J. Max and pulled numerous scary bathing suits, all that were small skimpy things i wouldnt wear if you paid me. we manage to aggree on a seriously tight red halter top of witch i dont think i am ever goign swimming if i have to wear it, tho i am goign to be forced to weart in on thursday ech. blah, anyway she also drags me to the dress section. i own one dress, the one i am wearign to graduation, i effing hate dresses. she forces me to try on pink dresses that look like something katie would wear (no offence katie) just not my style. so i pick out the darkest one i can find, its black and white floral (i have never worn floral, ever, even my mum cant remember the last time i had floral). so i look like i belong in some freaking gap comerical (i doubt they would ever pick me, eck, i am so not model worthy).   moving on, i still wanta klit kat ::winkwink nudgenudge:: it would make a great graduation present, saying my parents arent getting me anything, but whatever. i leave you with this thought - carpeted celings.

       Well, I went to Bucks Rock, and I realized how much I love it there. I met up with old friends, I made a new friend, Elias, and had a great time. When I first got there, I tried to find my friends, I found Aly, amber, Ben, Rafi, Nat, and Ed (Ed's a girl despite the name). the group went swimming with some other people we met, it was fun. ed and I walked around and met a guy named Elias (wouldn't have met him if he wasn't wearing that Donnie Darko shirt). Then dinner after we ate the trip come back (there was a convention thing) and Eli, a good friend of mine came back... but he had to work so we couldnt hang out for too long. The whole group (minius Aly, Amber, and Eli they had play practice and work) and some other people, went to play dice games, and hang out.&nbsp;We had an awesome time. And then... the play started,&nbsp;I was supossed to go and watch it with my mum, but I didnt (heh heh heh). Elias, Ed, Rafi, Ben and&nbsp;I walked around, till ben wandered off ( ::scowl:: ) then the remaining sat on the lawn and talked, every once in a while walking&nbsp;down to visit Eli&nbsp;(he had to video tape the play) alltogether we had an awesome time, and&nbsp;I would go back to BR in a heart beat. Anyway, for now... Spork.

      Lets start this off right. my favroite comic books were Sonic the Hedgehog and Xmen. i didnt realy like Spiderman or Batman. when it came to TV shows, i liked Spiderman, Teenage mutant ninga turtles, and Xmen. so my mum takes us to see Spiderman2 now, the first one was allright. and i had heard realy good reviews about the second one, lots of people said it was the best action hero movie ever made.   what i thought? well i have seen a lot of really good action movies and a lot of really good dramas. i have also seen a lot of really bad action movies and a lot of realy bad dramas. so what i thought the makers did? take the worst of both worlds. see if there was no drama Spiderman2 would have been an allright action movie. and if they had taken out all the action it would have been a allright drama. but no, they had to put in a whole lot of drama, and a whole lot of action and none the less they had to leave the perfect endign for a third movie!!!now, of all the people who i know that have seen the movie liked it, they all thought it was awesome. most of the people who told me to see it have good taste in movies, but now so sorry i dont have as much respect for you now. in total: i realy hated Spiderman2. spork.

      that was one of the best rock concert mosh pits i have ever been in. ok overview of what happended: got to concert late, pushed way through crown to mosh pit, moshed, crowd surfed, moshed, almost broke arm, left mosh pit, was offered ex, refused, went back to most pit, moshed, left in search of water (no luck, only beer), got back in mosh pit, moshed, crowd surfed, then the lead siner from phantom planet crowd surfed (while i was surfing, we ran into each other it was cool), moshed, got burnt by someones cig (who the hell brings a cig into a mosh pit?? its gonna scar), moshed,  crowd surfed, moshed and it ended. it was the best rock concert mosh pit i have ever been in. i got hurt a bit, a few scratches, a lot of brusies. and the only bad thing: some guy grabbed my glow stick (hanging around my neak) he was leading me away from the pit so i ripped away (lost the glow stick and my neaklase but hey, thats better than losing other things). and that about all that happened, but it was so much fun. i had an aweosome time. and i am happy tucker comes home tommrow and i get to play DnD with some friends. =sporko=

      The_Tractor posted this on the  urlLink BotD  and it seemed to die away, so I wanted to revive it.  I'm thinking about getting stuff so that I can play Dungeons and Dragons with people. If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun. I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot. It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something. Happy nerdiness!  Anyway, I'd be very interested in doing a campaign with some other people(I could DM maybe....) so if you want to join, just comment here!

      And it is when you look into that bright light at the end of the tunnel that you realize "Oh God, we are so fucked." This is where we begin and end.  One bright summer afternoon when all is well, birds chirping, sun blasting it's radioactive death rays down onto us, not an apocalyptic cloud in the sky; everything can go awry in a matter of seconds.  Just when everything seems ordinary, the extraordinary goes and gives you one giant wallop in the face.  A small child, it could be any small child, but let's just call him Billy, was frolicking in his back yard when the sky opened up. This is your extraordinary. What happens when the sky opens up, you ask?  Well, let me tell you my children, it is not a pleasant thing.  Your eyes boil and your skin melts, then you are torn to shreds in a matter of nanoseconds.  The sky, you see, wants to fill this void and therefore needs matter to fill it.  This matter could come from anywhere, typically it uses oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen that's floating in the air.  But this is different.  It wants Billy.  When the sky opens up, it creates a giant BOOM which feels very much like being punched by a 15 foot novelty boxing glove.  This knocked him to the ground, and allowed him to see this extraordinary event take place.  As he lay flattened on the grass, unable to breath, his vision began to go askew, making everything bubble.  His eyes were indeed boiling, soon they will become part of a soup formally known as his central nervous system.  At this very moment, his skin became prickily and wet.  His skin was indeed melting, soon to become a puddle on the grass.  Shortly after, he was ripped into the vortex, his body torn to bits, then reassembled in whatever fashion it could be reassembled.  As he swirls through the atmosphere, or rather lack of one, he sees a bright light. This is your light at the end of the tunnel. He had always been told in church and by his parents that the light at the end of the tunnel symbolized hope.  This, however, is not the case in this situation.  Billy attempts to reach his hand up for that bright light, only to hear the garbled tearing of muscle in the wind.  It has Billy.  His arm, at least.  What is this bright light you ask?  Well, interpret it as you wish.  This is up to you.  Billy's eyes started to water, he knew it was the end.  When he reached that light, it felt as though he had been reborn.  The purest water you can't even imagine washed over him, cleansed his body and mind, and restored him to his former self.  But for what? He had been stranded in the middle of nowhere, to die.  His light was some kind of hope, but it was also his greatest fear, and will cause his demise. He walks. And as he walks, the world around him begins to form into something familiar.  It is at this moment he realizes what has happened. He collapsed into himself. But what kind of life is this?  He is alone in his mind, and what will happen when his subconscious takes over?  This will have to wait for next time.

      For the first time since the end of school I met up with Brandon and Sean to PK at Vincent Elementary, and DAMN WAS IT AWESOME!!  I got there about 20 minutes before everyone else and pk'd some, but really not a lot seeing as I feel tired.  AANYWAY.  I drilled monkey vaults and attempted some kongs, which I still freak out on and dont put my legs through my arms.  Oh well.  Um, we talked a lot and ate food some.  Then when Brandon got there we started going around the playground a little bit.  Much to my surprise, I found that rolling on woodchips is not comfortable after a 10 foot drop, they feel like little rocks digging into your spine.  So I went back to vaulting this little tube thing, that was fun. Then Sean came and we practiced wall-runs, stretched, and did some flow activities.  I need to relax for a little bit, but not moving for a day is rough.  I'm addicted!!!

      First of all, I'm finally in the blog.  Second, I had the strangest dream when I was in North Carolina.  I walked up to a bottle of aloe.  I said to myself, "Hmmm, I wonder what this would taste like..."  So I picked up a spoon and squirted some aloe into it.  I ate the aloe, and it didn't taste too bad.  I kept eating and eating until I started to feel sick.  Then I read on the label: do not consume aloe.  If you do, drink lots of water, but only if you live near a water tower.  If you don't, the water could be contaminated with animal feces.  So that's it.  When I remembered the dream in the kayak place, I remembered the taste and started feeling really sick.  It didn't help when Evan started showing me all of the aloe bottles...

      I'm back home from North Carolina! WHEE!!  Anyway, hope everyone had as much fun while I was gone as I did.  We arrived on Topsail Beach Sunday morning after driving for.... 9 hours I believe, and when we got in everything was clean and cool and oh-so pretty.  So we wasted no time in getting unpacked, then I went down to the beach with Trachtman and we flopped around in the waves for a good bit.  That's pretty much what we did.  On Monday we went downtown to get some ice cream/play miniature golf/go to the arcade, which was sweet.  I had mint chocolate chip, oh so tasty. Tuesday: More beach, got sunburnt : ( and then we went out for lunch.  I had onion rings and a grilled cheese sandwich.  God was that a mistake, the onion rings decided to take baths in grease before I consumed them, so that they could eat my stomach lining and render me useless for the rest of the day.  Ouch.  That night we played Spoons, in which Mrs. Trachtman and I were the victors. Wednesday:  Stomach said "Ok, I killed the nasty grease," and I was on my way.  I practiced front flips that day for a bit, landed on my back a lot, scraped my head once, and hit my heels a few times.  Then we(Tracht-dogg, Mrs. Trachtman and I) went to go kayaking, but we saw some lightning and were instructed to turn back, so we did and got a pass for a free hour of kayaking the next day.   Thursday:  I hung around at the house after waking up late, waiting to go kayaking...  So we went around 11:00 and it turns out the tide isn't high enough for us to go out on the water, and there's a group of 21 coming in later.  So we are instructed to come back around 4:30.  We get back, go down to the beach for a few hours, and I come out really really really tired(flipping over waves is fun!!).  So then we went kayaking, finally, for our full hour.  Only this time my parents came along.  So we got there and I found some nice nice shoes(Merrell Chameleons... droooolllll.....) but they were $100, and I had already bought new shoes for PK.  And they didn't have any in a big enough size.  Blah.  Ok, 1 hour of Kayaking, I led the group most of the way, it was a lot of fun and made me realize that I'm actually in shape!  I wasn't tired by the end of it, I was impressed.  Anyway, it was great.  There were some fish jumping out of the water, I'm not sure what kind(Ben, you remember?)...  But it was pretty, there was marsh grass and the water was only like 2 feet deep, pretty neat.  Then we went home and played spoons again.  I didn't win. Friday:  We went home... Drove a lot.  Stayed at a hotel.  I got a sinus headache.  Couldn't fall asleep until 1:00 a.m. Saturday:  HOME, WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  After a lot of driving, we finally made it home!  It felt nice to get back into Pughtown and see my puppy-hound and brother and everything.  It just felt so good, I was home!  So I hung around a bit with Matt and read the new Newsweek, then brought my stuff in.  After that I went out and PK'd like a madman, it felt wonderful.  My legs were dying to PK, and when I finally did, they just absorbed everything.  Cleared the 4.5 foot fence like it was nothing, it felt fantastic.  Climbed up my porch and spun around over the rail, then went inside.  I had missed that so much.  Then we went out for dinner and I ate food.  Now I am not hungry.  Then videogames.  Now I'm on AIM wondering why music isn't playing.  Well, that's it. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH

      Yay! I'm in in blog! That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and seemed they were in their 30's! Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes...STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!  For more on the concert, go to my other blog, www.thehopelesslifeofgabo.blogspot.com

      Hello everyone, and here is the first post on Rhythm Section.  Have you ever seen the Nike ads with the guys jumping from building to building, climbing through car parks and the like?  Perhaps you've seen the Scion ad with the Traceurs(Freerunners) and would like to know more.  This sport has become my passion, I would like to spread it to you.  The definitive site for worldwide Traceurs is  urlLink Urban Freeflow .  They have extraordinarily friendly message boards, tutorials for various parts of Parkour, as well as information about jams happening all around the world.  I strongly encourage that you check it out.  If you want to just watch some videos you can also check out  urlLink Le-Parkour.com .  It's an intriguing/invigorating sport. Enjoy!

(22:50:05) Jood: And when they had this apocalyptic epiphany, they all dropped their jaws, and let their eyes grow wide with amazement as they watched his silhouette fall into the horizon (22:50:34) Dougie: as he dropped 500 feet onto a raging river that flowed over razor-sharp spikes (22:50:40) Dougie: that were poisonous (22:50:46) Dougie: and explosive (22:50:54) Jood: doug. you just lost the cinematic feel (22:50:55) Jood: c'mon (22:51:27) Dougie: and the a glorious, soaring eagle picks him up and wraps him in an American flag (22:51:30) Dougie: then* (22:51:41) Dougie: and everybody breakdances (22:52:08) Jood: Only to have the flag burn his skin, like holy water on a demons chest.

        Everybody's dying just to get the disease      Not in a fantastic mood, I am bored, and need a distraction.  Hence posting and random Elliott Smith lyrics.  Just so you guys know, either/or is an amazing album.  It's a little soft but angst-ridden and slightly depressing, but beautiful.  I love it, love it to death.  Anyway... Hmm... Let's see. I'm looking into overclocking my little rosewill nVidia GeForce FX5500 256 MB 128-bit videocard, and I did, just a teeny bit.  The core-clock frequency is now 300 mhz as opposed to the original 270, and it still runs nice and cool.  The memory frequency is upped like 15 mhz as well.  But that is all the overclocking I will do in this.(Wait... the processor is already overclocked... oh well! i'll take a 400 mhz FSB!)  Hmm.... Ok, ima go play with this utility I just downloaded.  so.. have fun!

      Rachel, could you talk to RJ about making it so that the rest of our characters could be level 3 as well? Seeing as how we don't have too much money (except for Quig and Dougie) and you have about 1000, I don't think it's very fair.  Also, I think that it would benefit the whole group as well as individual players, because Quig and Dougie would get more spells and stuff like that.  On a completely different note, do you think that I should make a blog devoted specifically to our D&D campaign?  And on another completely different note, do you think it would be possible to have a D&D sleepover at some point?

      Doug, I apologize for slapping you after you fainted when fighting that dragon, Spork, awesome job crossing that bridge, Ben, next time, bring more changes of clothes.  By the way, I have a question for the D&D experts: I was looking in my PHB, and my feat Combat Casting says I should gain a +4 on my concentration checks.  My concentration is 6, with a 4 under "ranks".  Should I add another 4 under "Misc Modifiers"?  Just a question.

      Hi everyone. I haven't been paying attention this thingy much because no one posts, and if they do it's doesn't apply to me.  But now that I'm in RJ's epic evil campaign, I suppose I should. (ph33r t3h \/a|\/|pir3 |3l@ckgu4rd)

      I guess I should start paying attention the again, seeing as I now joined RJ's 16th level EVIL campaign. You will all learn to ph33r the vampire blackguard. Except that RJ is starting us out with no equipment. SUGGESTED GOLD IS 260k, I HAVE NATZINK. And I totally generated a +3 Unholy Flaming Burst Intelligent Larger Greatsword with Deathwatch always cast and 10 Ranks in Intimidate, which I would hide in my Glove of Storing Soulknife style because RJ didn't let me be a Soulknife. In conclusion, whee. I wonder how many non-DnD brains I just melted with this post.

       This is Dougie speaking on Sporko's behalf, since she is in New Orleans and must pay for an Internet connection with money out of her own pocket. Getting to the point, Sporko wants people to bring their yearbooks with them to school so that she might have a chance to sign them. I'm bringing mine, you should too.

       Unfortunatly, it is unlikely that a "cross-dressing day" will happen. The only day it is possible is Tuesday. Monday and Thursday we have off, Wednesday, is the awards ceremony for the atletic awards and honors, (Mrs. Braxton will be taking pictures) and obviously due to commencement we will be unable switch on Friday. (That is of course unless Katie is willing to give up her Versace dress or Cimmie plans on losing a hundred pounds so she can fit in a guy's outfit). Nevertheless, we have to do this switch on Tuesday, if at all. This wont work if someone forgets or backs out thinking "Oh my God, if I cross-dress I won't graduate, because they'll expell me!" We need to coordinate plans since our only choice of a day is the next day we have school. We need to figure out something soon. My Idea is the following: In this 'chatterbox,' write your name if you are   willing  to participate. Maybe we'll do it if more than half the class is willing. After that, I'll make arrangements with people asking if they can let someone borrow their skirt or pants. I will also support requests so Emily can get in Kyle's pants. Below is the chatterbox and I hope this can happen with your support.   Write your First name, and whether or not you are willing to participate.      var chatterbox = 'no';         urlLink target="flooblechatterbox"  onClick="window.open('about:blank','flooblechatterbox','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,copyhistory=no,width=480,height=400');return true;">  align="absbottom">Talk   in my  urlLink flooble chatterbox, a free javascript chat tag board / shoutbox / tagboard program for your xanga, diary, blogger or weblog  |   urlLink logic puzzles, brainteasers      if (!chatterbox || chatterbox != 'ok') {  document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable. It will be back up shortly.'); }

       for some odd reason my mother (yes, my mother) felt the need to discuss the cross-dressing day with me and she thinks it would be funny, but says we should do it (if we do it at all) on Tuesday because wednesday is the moving up ceremony and the acedemic awards thingy so people will be in full "dress code mode" and they might not approve...

       We should totally do a cross dressing day. While I fully understand about the whole uncomfortable to wear a skirt and problem with getting the right sizes things, we should still do it becuase it would be really funny and no one's ever done it before.

       ok so here's my thought: since we have the awards ceremony on wednesday, june 2nd, it would be wise to be dressed in regular uniform for that event. We, however, could switch dress codes on tuesday. That was a good idea tori, with going to the trift store, because it would also be problematic if we didn't get our uniforms back in time for the awards ceremony on wednesday (I don't know about the rest of you, but i only own one kilt that fits me). If anyone likes this idea, please say so in your next blog

       From now on, you  have to  include titles.  This is because otherwise, it seems like you named your post something else.  For instance,  A Wrinkle in Time  by Madeleine L'Engle would be called  It was a dark and stormy....   Doesn't work.  That includes you too, Emily Combe.

This is not finalized and I don't want only like one person showing up so I have included a poll stating if we should go. I will decide whether or not the movie is on based on the popularity of the category "yes we should do it." If it is less than half, than the trip is off (and visa versa). I hope we can do it tonight at 7:00.    urlLink The Day After Tomorrow (PG-13, 124 min.)| 7:00pm |     THE MOVIE IS OFF, NO ONE WILL BE ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MOVIE

       This blog is being posted due to the fact that little development has happened recently regarding the last day of school uniform swap. If we all plan to switch uniforms with a certain individual, we must somehow organize something soon. Also what do we consider the last day of school? I think if  everyone  participates, this will be a success. We must plan this soon and pray that there is not a drop-the-dress-code-day on the last day of school.

       Remember what I say in my post I'm Baaaaaaaaack?  I said that I had not been eaten/stolen by wolves/gypsies, not Bob, and not studying for finals.  I was helping Cimmie to lose weight, remember????  Unfortunately, it didn't work.

       You are indeed right, Sporko. I do have lots of friends. Lots of very good friends without whom I am uncertain as to what my fate would have been. And believe me, I love you all too.  In other news, Tucker created this awesome piece of work, possibly using declassified CIA technology:       It's going to be the cover for Ted's album when it is released. That should be happening fairly soon, with any luck at all. Oh, and you can click right  urlLink here  if you want to see a real photo of Ted.

       I know you're gonna hate this Dougie, but i have to post this. This is  one of Dougies away messenges... "I have nobody. My dad, the last person left in my life who believed in me, just got turned against me by my mom. My sister hates my guts and my mom and my dad think I'm a slacker. My grades have dropped in school and I'm going to end the year by disgracing myself. I'm probably going to do badly on my finals. The ex-marine who used to live here is breaking into our studio to use it and he's messing with our dogs. Add in the whole unrequited love and teenage angst, and my life is 100%, unfiltered, premium, grade A shit" I think this means that we have a friend in need, if everyone is willing to donate something that would cheer our heart-broken friend up, post it, donate to the "boost-dougies-self-esteem-fund". Thank You

       Hi, you know you love  urlLink Apple , but only 1% of computer users use it. Most of the 98% of  urlLink Windows  users say that they don't use  urlLink Macs  because of compatibility (where only few of their beloved Windows programs are not usable on Macs.) I don't think that was among the things that bothered  urlLink this man  but he was definitely bothered. Don't get me wrong that I dislike Apple Computers (because I am about to switch, as I like them more than windows machines), but this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. This man speaks of his experience on the Mac very badly, but it is funny because although he "dislikes Macs" he still uses them and even edited the video on a Mac.  urlLink Check it out here  , and   enjoy .

       ::clap::, at least someone is on my side, I have nothing against Emily (well for this argument at least) but I just don't see what's she's adding to this blog, she just screws everything up, breaks all the rules and then does a stupid lie apology and does it again. It's really not cool.

       i take it i have been banned from speaking in hacker, sayign i doubt anyof you can read hacker fluently (knowing a few words is NOT considered fluent.) blah, where did quiggy go anyway, i miss him. and emily the poll that tuck put up was "mabye later if she breaks more rules" and "yes" i personaly voted yes, you have broken enough rules as it is. 60% says "mabye later" its later we shoudl kick you out, youve broken enough rules. 40% thought we should have kicked you out a while ago. quiggy, we need your expert advice on this matter (or your password so i can kick her out.) for now, this is sporko reporting from SBC (sporko brodcasting company)

       It's fine. I know, Quiggy did break his own rule, but that was 'cause he had sort of... well, he freaked out, frankly. And we can use mild curse words, if you really want to. And, of course, you can curse as much as you want as long as it's in a different language. For instance, I frequently say bugger (although, that's just British slang, not a different language). And I am certainly going to miss you too. And you. And you. Heck, I'll miss all of you.  In other news, I figured out what was messing the blog up and I fixed it, so everything's back to normal, although you might want to check out the sidebar for the updated rules. I did some tweaking.

       thanks dougie----again, I'm sorry taco and quiggy and dougie. I do not understand why we cannot use curse words, seeing that quiggy broke his OWN rule by using the word--and i quote "fucking" in one of his posts-----again I am sorry, and i just wana keep this blog going as long as possible, I'm going to miss all you guys soo much next year!

       Do you think maybe we could keep the fightin' and the feudin' to a minimum?  To Tucker: Scroll down. Emily apologized, she had not read your post. I, at least, am not going to kick her out. Also, as you are not an admin you don't set the rules, although I would prefer mild swear words (or badly misspelled ones ::cough  urlLink danmmed  cough::) to a constant stream of not-so-mild ones. One other thing is, we don't all always spell everything right. I know I don't.  To Emily: Tucker is right in that a proper respect for the rules should be maintained. However, as you did apologize, I don't see any real problem.  To Quiggy: Where the heck are you, Quiggy!? This blog is succumbing to chaos! There is looting and pillaging in the streets! Somebody, light the Quig-signal!  We need you Quiggy!

Well, you just used your last chance, someone please kick Emily out!!! I'm not trying to be mean but shes breaking every rule and grr....I'm done.

Well, this was fun lets do it again sometime. Whoever centered the whole blog (quiggy...) should be brutally beaten my me it looks weird, at least I think it does. P.S.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg, everyone loves him/her but nobody knows her real sexual identity. That was all to change when we did a drive by of Sonoco's A-plus. Cimmie handed the slip asking whether she/he preferred Coke or Pepsi which Taylor had recently typed up, and...after much speculation over the whole "it's for a school newspaper" alabi, Meg filled out the form. The first field was her name which we told him/her was unnecessary to fill out so she left it blank. Right below that field, however was the most important field...the gender question. It asked wheter or not Meg was a girl or if she was a boy. Taylor waited until we left A-plus to read it. And it read FEMALE. I was shocked Meg is/was/will be a female. I was convinced she was a he, but I am starting to face reality and I can't wait to see Meg over the summer when I visit A-plus.  Oh and P.S. Emily, USE TITLES!

       Have you ever had a craving to make your own song? Get a laugh? Eat some Chinese food? No? Well you need to go to this website to get some inspiration and a laugh, but I don't think they offer Chinese food. I am not going to ruin any surprises but it sounds pretty cool if you type in the only large field in the website (I wont say what it's labeled)"I found this place not to long ago, This is too much fun. I know what I will do tonight." Don't ask someone told me to do it and it the result is surprisingly good. You wont regret clicking on  urlLink this link . Enjoy!

Because of that outburst I have decided to kill you....with hugs and caring.  Thanks for your time, Taco

       I have a new idea, quite possibly the best one yet.  We should split into two teams, the United States of Blog and the Confederate States of Blog.  Each team gets their own blog.  Each team also gets their own Brain-Eating account.  For one week, each team tries to eat more brains than the other team.  You may affect B of D, however the changes must be fixable.  Doug and I would be on seperate teams, and would not make any new administrators or delete old ones.  Vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool.

       ...if you're desperately bored or have an addiction to voting in polls. In case the previous sentence didn't tip you off, the Blog of the Danmmed is proud to bring you another poll! The results of the previous poll indicated that Quiggy and I are evil mutant lobster chickens, which would explain why typing is so difficult.

       Well, seeing as how the reaction seems to be a resounding thumbs down, I will remove the post, but I still think that the song is hilarious.  I sincerely apoligize to anyone who was offended.  If the admins care to warn me, so be it.  Once again, I'm sorry.

       That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and seemed they were in their 30's! Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes...STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!

       Quiggy is not being oppressive; he is discriminating accordingly. So far in its virtual existence, The Blog of the Danmmed has existed as a haven for Montgomery students, now ex-Montgomery students of course, and he is merely sticking by the principles on which this blog was founded. While in the future there may be exceptions to this, you have not made an overly convincing case for yourself. I hope that future animosity between the denizens of the BotD and yourself may be avoided, and I do apologize if the current configuration of the BotD has caused you any distress. However, we are currently unable to fulfill your wish to join, and as your present actions contradict any perceived desire you might have to join, we do not see a possibility of a wish of that nature being fulfilled in the foreseeable future. Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

        I have been pretty bored this summer. I have watched tv and played video games and sometimes gone to the pool. Now that the public schools are out I will actually have someting fun to do.

       First of all, I know who wrote the stuff on the Chatterbox.  It was Evan's brother, Matt.  Evan and Matt are down in NC with me and that is my IP address.  He used Evan's laptop.  Because I revealed the evil (not to say hilarious) prankster, we should not have the chatterbox post/blog post rule.  If that rule stays in effect, I will have to flood the blog again, and remember how irritating that got?  I wil also flood the chatterbox just to get rid of the great prank messages.

        Just so everyone knows, I am temporarily enforcing a new rule: if you post,  you must also enter a message into the chatterbox   This is twofold: it will help remove the offensive messages, and it will help me catch the doer of these evil doings.   SHOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A MESSAGE, I MAY ASSUME THAT IT IS YOU!!!

       Attention everybody:  this is a public service announcement.  The chatterbox is completely rude and offensive.  Unless the person responsible comes forward, they will be kicked out when they are discovered.  Should they come forward, they will only recieve one warning.  Thank you.

       I'm thinking about getting stuff so that I can play Dungeons and Dragons with people.  If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun.  I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot.  It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something.  Happy nerdiness!

Emily's or Tori's???  Well the one thing I know is that it won't be at my house on account of the fact that if anybody wanted to swim... it would be in my bathtub.  Well best of luck to whoever figures this out.  I will come though... where ever and whenever it may be.  So that is all for now. Cheerio,  Kelsey

       Here's an idea for that pool party: if we were to have a pool party at night, it would probably be best to have a sleep-over because I have a feeling that my parents, at least, would be somewhat less than willing to pick me up at someone's house at whatever it may be, 2 AM or whatever. So, as I said, if it were a sleep-over it could go as late as we wanted without any worries.  Just an idea.

       It's the future of concerts!! I was at the Blink 182/ No Doubt concert, which was seroiuly rockin' and they had this thingy, were they played like a slower song and they were like "before many of u were born, in the late 90's, during a slow song poeple held up lighters, but now it's the techonloy age and everything so in recongion of this ever hold up you're cell phones instead". Cool idea right, well its was awesome, one of the coolest thing's I've ever seen. Just had to share that moment, and i got a cool pic but it was too dark and didnt come out right.

       20 things I have learned Through My eighth Grade Experience: 1. Before you insult someone, make sure they are not standing behind you. You will save yourself much explaining and stuttering and awkwardness this way 2. TRY to remember where you left your bag - they have a tendency to move around 3. learn how to open your locker rather than having someone else do it all year long 4. Never volunteer if you don't know what you will be doing 5. Be creative with your excuses 6. continuation of #5: become emotional 7. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE YOUR PENS (YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN) 8. Visible bra straps are a no-no 9. The same goes for clear dresses 10. Don't be downwright mean to anyone without proper contemplation - you might need them to do something for you later 11. When in doubt, employ the phrase "I didn't do it!" 12. be inconspicuous when chewing illegal gum 13. Always get out of running laps - again, be creative and remember, it's all in the timing... 14. Make friends with the lunch people 15. Wear the specified socks  16. EVERYTHING has a loophole - it's your job to find them 17. listen to everyones advice and then promptly disregard it (haha ms. V and the box projects) 18. remember that you will be seeing these people almost every day for the next year - be nice to them 19. inside jokes will not seem funny when you tell them to others - hence the name inside jokes. And...last but not least... 20. Stand out  I hope you all feel very knowledgable now. --feel free to post your own knowledge you acquired this year

       Sorry, that was my stomache.  Begging for more water.  I've been living on water lately.  Oh well, at least I have no chance of getting dehydrated.   Anyways... people who have control over these things (sadly not me): FIX THE LINK TO MY BLOG!   PLEASE! it just takes you to a page that says error or something.  I think it's because I deleted my other blog and started another one, but it's under the same username so it should work...i hope thank you for your time

       Ok, today we have my favorite music list, stolen straight from the blog of Gabo. (not in order)     THE WHITE STRIPES!! ::  (::insert loud cheering here::) um...well everything, there are only about 2 or 3 white stripes songs i dont love, but i still like all of it. But if I had to choose a favorite it would be the self titled cd. NIRVANA!!: they have this three disk CD thingy, titled Nirvana (hm..how orginial), thats the best one. Franz Ferinand: one of the CD's in my stereo now, is there one and only CD, self titled Phantom Planet: yes Carson, I do like some emo, both of Their CD's are awesome but the second one is my favorite Jimi Hendrix: Are you expierienced (or the greatest hits, but thats kinda cheating) Led Zepplin: IV and III Crystal Method: greatest techno band ever, um..it's the CD with the crab on it, damn, don't remember the name     Ramones: again I'm gonna cheat and say Greatest hits Red Hot Chili Peppers: By the Way Vines: Winning Day's Weezer: Pinkerton (yes more emo, but only pinkerton) VON BONDIES!!: amazing band, you have to buy Pawn Shoppe Heart Hives: Veni Vedi Vicuois (expect spelled right) Less than Jake: fine I give up, Hello Rockveiw and Anthem are good, but Pezcore still sucks!! Muse: have no idea what the album is... AC/DC: Back in Black, you HAVE to buy this Modest Mouse: damn the radio for over playing this song, this was MY song, i predicted it would get big and now everyone sings it :: sob:: Black Sabbath: We Sold our Souls for Rock and Roll, best quote ever..." I was into sex, drugs and rock and roll, was paying for the sex and the drugs"- Ozzy Bush: Sixteeth Stone, everything zen is a awesome song... Metallica: Saint Anger Green Day: (I'm cheating again) Greatest Hit's Yeah, that's a pretty good list but I'm sure I left someone out...

       This is an awesome story, it's the weirdest accident ever... A construction worker in Lancaster, Calif., is   expected to make a full recovery after accidentally being shot in the   head with a nail gun -- six times. Three of the nails penetrated his   brain; one entered his spinal column, but luckily not his spinal cord.   Witnesses say Isidro Mejia, 39, fell from the roof of the house he was   building onto another worker who was using the gun below. "The guy   holding the nail gun was grabbing to keep from falling, and just   gripped tighter on the trigger," said a Los Angeles County sheriff's   investigator. "It's a nail gun they use for framing. It can drive nails   through 2-by-4s." (Los Angeles Times) ...It's the first time L.A. cops   have said it: a Mexican guy really was framed.    urlLink pictures (don't worry, just x-rays)

       Wow, this is really sad...All of my friends are away so instead I'm spending my time over a celebirty obsession of Craig Nicholls, or as I like to call him CN, (the crazy lead guitarist and singer of The Vines) who looks like he's stoned...but..oh well...so does Green Poncho Boy... Anyway, for all of you Vines lovers out there (like myself). Here's the most amazing music video ever!!!!!!... Ride...(I'm lazy so just cut and paste this in the address box yourself)... http://www.nme.com/features/107518.htm  If you want more of my pointless ramblings of CN or the lyric to Ride, go to my blog...you know where it is...

       Your random history lesson of the day.  (Because it pertains to my 20th Century Project).  Franz, also known as Francis, Ferdinand was the Archduke of Austria-Hungary in 1914.  In early July, he and his wife were driving through the town of Sarajevo, Bosnia, when 19 year-old Gavrilo Princip stepped out of the crowd and opened fire.  This event triggered world war 1, one of the bloodiest military conflicts of all time.

       three awesome bands for you today... Bumblebeez 81- these guys r pretty garage rocky but all there songs r mixed by one of there own who is a pro dj so really cool sounding. Very slickly combining hives and white stripes...these guys have a video that im sure is gonna be playing on mtv very soon so look out for them.   Whirlwind Heat- i gurantee you have never and will never hear of these guys from anyone but me... they are very odd, have thier own flare, a personal favorite of mine...  The Dirtbombs- love LOVE these guys, very cool have two of every intersting, but are still pretty smooth and jazzy, kinda up beat too but still rocking  i have a few other bands that you should check out but arent as good and have no chance at stardom.... -The Soledad Brothers (blues...no one here would like them) -Blanche (smooth as silk)  OK, im done.. goodbye until next time...

       Back in the age of pirates, there was one ship that ruled the seas.  It was a typical pirate ship, with a typical captain.  The only strange thing was that the captain always wore a red shirt.  One day, one of the crew members went up to the captain and asked, "Why do you always wear that red shirt?"  "Oh that?" asked the captain.  "I wear that so that if I ever get shot, you will never see the blood, so that you can keep in fighting the same."  And so the guy walked away thinking  OK, that's pretty cool.  We've got a pretty great guy for our captain .  Later that day, an enemy ship started approaching.  The pirates got ready for battle, and started sailing towards the enemies.  They shot a few warning shots, which were responded with other shots.  Soon, both sides were almost ready to fight when the captain yelled back to the crew, "Quick!  Go get my brown pants!"
