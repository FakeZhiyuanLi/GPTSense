       comes this copout.  But since nobody's reading this yet, I doubt it makes much difference - a test of the "tree falling in the woods" theory...   - I Can't -   Please forget the words that I just blurted out, it wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt, it keeps rattling my cage.  And there's nothing in this world will keep it down,  and even though I might, even though I try, I can't. Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.  Soon your things that keep, that keep me underground,  so many words that I, that I can never find. If you give up on me now,  I'll be gutted like I've never been before.   And even though I might, even though I try, I can't  Even though I might, even though I try, I can't   If you give up on me now, I'll be gutted like I've never been before.   And even though I might, even though I try, I can't Even though I might, even though I try, I can't, even though I might, even though I try, I can't.  Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.      Thom Yorke

        urlLink    where it all begins, so to speak.  This was from almost three years ago atop a spire of Warwick Castle in England.  Some of my first pieces of music started around here.&nbsp; urlLink

        my brain is the film.&nbsp; I want to write every word that spills through this stupid mechanism,&nbsp;an illogical machine, a perpetual game, a chaos of&nbsp; chemical, of blood, of thought.&nbsp; clash and death make a note, and&nbsp;leave it &nbsp;in a puddle.&nbsp; the price of originality? &nbsp;of true formation, never to find a duplicate in all its excess? - unforgiving mourning.&nbsp; endless sadness.&nbsp; true ignorance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I want to write every word of it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Those who choose to see through love excel despite  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despair, while those who choose to hate will despair despite their  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ability to excel.” – a solar return chart
