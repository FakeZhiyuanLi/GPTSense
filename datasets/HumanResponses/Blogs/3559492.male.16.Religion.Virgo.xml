      I'm happy now as I have now been  urlLink valued  at a considerable amount. Take a look and gawp at this truthfull estimate of my glorious worth. In other news ive found a really tight version of hot or not which rates ugliness-  urlLink clicko hereo   Also finally found a cheap copy of The Music (self titled album dontcha no). This is a marked relief as I've been looking for it for bloody ages, would you belive it but borders were charging £18 for it and I got it for £7. Whey!

      Suffice to say as I watch the tv tonight and yesterday I am a little pissed. Why? Because like a cunt I didn't even try to buy tickets to the god of all music festivals and have therefore missed one hell of a gig by the best band in the world - oasis (no arguments okay these guys are simply brilliant). Whats more if I was actually at Glastenbury I could watch the whole of Oasis's set and not just the highlights (though having said that the highlights do indeed rock). It wasnt just Oasis either. The Bees, Franz Ferdinand, Goldfrapp and The Chemical brothers were all shown. I love all these bands, why didnt I go why, what possesed me with settling to try and get tickets for 2005 when Oasis certainly will not be performing (though having said that I wouldnt be surprised if Blur were and if the Darkness manage to overcome second album syndrome they probably will to- despite slagging off the festival). Anyho new Razorlight albums out on Monday and once again im skint, arse, as it rained today I couldnt mow the lawn so will be seriousl out of pocket till thursday, upon which sacred day I'll probably get skint again by spending my whole allowance on CDs (the music, streets, supergrass, razorlight, morrisey ect) Well I spose I at least know what its like for a student (though strangely not so keen on the pot noodles)

      Yes I know that its very childish but humour me okay with these comedy poo related links.  urlLink Poo rating  (self explanitary really)  urlLink Poo pricing  - just how much is your dump really worth  urlLink Yahpoo  - yes its the comedy yahoo rip off youve always wanted  urlLink Just shite  (admitidely this ones got nowt to do with poo but you should understand why its here)  On a more important note its England Portugal tonight. This therefore means that Ronaldo is now scum for a night (but as soon as next season starts will once again be promoted to god, provided the git doesnt score). Anyho its time for the half boy half potato to do his magic and kick some prevebial portugese arse (or in the case of Nuno Gomez, his face simply for having such horribly greasy hair, I mean how do you get hare that greasy, its a cha;;enge in itself).

      Well I,m now back from Wales which actually turned out to be bloody good fun. The weather was pretty damn good, it looked like cornwall (complete with wierd sheep shagging yokels). Also I surfed for the first time in my life, suffice to say this is ludicrously fun as not only is trying to catch a wave great but catching a wave while dodging bedford makes the whole affair extra cool (plus bedfords crotch gives you something to aim for, after all the gits always going on about it). On a pissing off Tom note England are through to the quarters with style (thanks to the most skilled potato in the world) and will be ready to give the frogs a right waterloo of a thumping in the final (not bitter... no honestly I am really not. bloody zidane). Also on my insanely good music that nobody hears  urlLink clicko hereo

      Typical really. Th bloody computers playing up AGAIN. Yesterday the internet did not want to work and once again Dad couldnt give a toss. This of course if on top of me having to use the worst broadband ever(tm) which as it runs on wi fi is really slow (as the computer I use is situated in a practically lead lined H bomb proof room. So that explains why I couldnt post yesterday (well I couldnt be arsed either).  Bloody boring day it was though. Woke up far to early and nearly fell asleep loads during all the highly entertaining ucas stuff we were doing. Added to this Dezza walked off with my (new and damn good) frizbee and I cant find the git to get it back.  I did have some joy though in fidling with stuff in my room. I know it may sound dodgy but I fidle with lots of stuff (currently littering my room I ve got the remains of a shitty old acorn PC Ive taken apart as well as insane amounts of paper containing stuff of the net (jokes mainly but loads of bits that tell me how to create intresting things out of a paper clip and some blue tac). This all lead to me finding a bunch of shitty old computr speakers and rigging them together to form the mother of all speaker systems, which I then attacked to my CD player. However the great idea of rigging an entire room up with speakers and thenplaying Smells Like Teen Spirit at full volume through all of em (bloody load I can assure you, once did it at a friends house) was ruined when only two of the speakers actually worked (thereby ruining my cunning plan to make cheap surround sound for my room). Though this did lead to me fishing through my CD collection and finding some weird stuf I never new about (a really wierd version of Stone Roses Fools Gold being the chief offender but also a CD single I must of bought ages ago  by a group called the Dum Dums, remember them? thought not. They are just a little bit shite (though considerably better than the arch heretics known as busted).  Found this great rack on the net listen  urlLink here

      So the bloody frogs managed to pull something out of the bag. Typical really especially as we lost the game on penalties (far to much de ja vou). But life goes on and it should at least highlight how utterly crap Hesky is (whenever he gets the ball he falls over faster than an italien in the penalty box, who says man hasnt yet reached light speed).  Any way its back to school tommorow (boo hiss) which should be mildly amusing, simply to see the little amout of work were going to be doing (less for me of course). Its going to be odd though because it already feels like the summer holidays.  On a different note I just read OJs blog and saw his favourite films list. To say I was shocked would be a bit like describing a polar bear wearing shades inside a fridge as mildly cool. So ive decided to put up my list of ten favourites. If theres any ive missed out I probably havent seen em (Or my bitch of a sister has over recorded them before I could watch em).  1. Leon: Stylish, sweet, superbly acted and directed AND ludicrously slick and moving. Also any film with Jean Reno has to be good. 2. Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure + Bill and Teds Bogus Journy: Comon these films rock. Classic lines "Ted who was Joan of Arc" reply "er, Noahs wife" and the best ever parody of a classic film (ie the Silver Seal parody when they play twister with death) 3. Fight Club: God Brad Pitt is cool in this movie. Not only superbly made but also one hell of a mind fuck. 4.The Matrix: Just rocks, nuff said really 5.Trainspotting: Best film soundtrack ever, best monologue (the choose life one). Simply one of the most energetic vibrant films ever. 6.Monty Python and the Holy Grail: To be honest this could of quite easily been the Life of Brian but it doesnt really matter as they are respectively the two funniest films ever made. 7. City of God: great great film told very well shot beatifully and made all the more amazing because its a true story 8.Star Wars: lets face it light sabers and Ewoks rule! 9.Pirates of the Caribbean: plot holes you can drive a bus through, but who cares this is simply the most entertaining film i have ever seen, which is after all what the cinema is all about. 10.Gladiator: I just love this film, quite moving, brilliant acting and a superbly haunting soundtrack (though I've always wanted to know what happened to Maximus's dog)  Thats it, I bet I have forgotten at least one but hey I love all these films (so should you - unless your french, fucking zidane)

      Finished last business studies paper at 4:00 today which was a bit odd I am not really used to finishing exams that late (although on thursday I'm going to be finishing nearer five so it isnt that bad). Im now totaly nakered from all the work + not getting enough sleep the night before (the army were obviously enjoying having a lot of fun in their helicopters last night). Judging by my luck ive skrewed up the Biology despite the paper not being the hardest that ive seen, didnt revise the right bits as usual. Luckily business studies was fine (despite having two 16 mark questions and the lowest marked question being out of 8, of which of course there was just the one.) however my hand now feels like its been wnaking inccessantly for about a year (siack image but hey it fits).  also today I have learnt to hae my sister even more. I was helping the cow get her new phone to get a signal (something that now seems virtualy impossible in our house unless your phone also happens to be a microwave) when she stamped on my bad toe because I was trying to get it to work (which ii did manage ). Of course natraly it stopped working moments later and my sister burst out crying(shes 21). How i survive with my fucked up family is anyones guess(to anyone reading this who knows me I am actually the most sane person in my family, daft as it sounds)  answer to yesterdays question is Black Sabbath and paranoid incidentaly Q have just rated Oasis Definately maybe as the best British album ever with morning glory not even making the grade of the top 50 now call me a philistine but somethings got to be wrong with that.

      Today has once again been wasted. I seemed to have spent it all trying to revise, yet as so often happens I ended up looking at the birdies. For a bloody long time. Well lets face it its a damn site more interesting than actually revising. What makes this flagrant time wasting worse is that the exams are tomorrow and I now seem to have five of them to do.  Typical really, it would all be fine if I hadn't cocked up the biology in January and only got a C (a high one mind) when I should of got a A after all thats what I had got in the mock and was predicted (bugger and indeed double bugger). What this leaves me with is one hell of an exam fest tomorrow. In total I am in the exam room for around four hours fifty minutes. Wup-de-fucking-do.  On a lighter note (before you all break out the violins anyway) its only four days till Euro 2004 starts with England ready to give France a decent Agincourt of a wupping on Sunday (though unlike agincourt are odds are a bit better though unfortunately the Queen wont be captening the team on the pitch which is a shame)  Now for the caption competition of the day (if any body can be arsed) name the song these lyrics are taken from   "People think I'm insane because I'm frowning all the time" end

      right so this is my first bloody blog, considering i can never be arsed to work most days it seems odd that i can be bothered to do this after all id probably give a sloth a run for its money in the laziness stakes.   There is a wee problem though. EXAMS wupee cant wait for those im positively orgasmic with exitement as the day of tuesday aproaches. Five bloody exams on one day its excessive. The exam program timetable planners must be thicker than an American GI with the Berlin wall nailed to his head. to make it worse just two bloody days later ive got six exams, SIX! I might as well write the little note and jump off a bridge now.  now as i cant be arsed to write any more heres my true quote of the day that scarily is actually true* Q: She had three children, right?  A: Yes.  Q: How many were boys?  A: None.  Q: Were there any girls?    * Okay admidedly this was said in an american court so I spose anything goes

      Ah those magic words: summer holiday. Eight weeks of doing absolutely nothing. Can't beat it really. However it is during this most wonderful of times that you may experience one of the worlds worst torments: The pissing off nagging sergeant majoresque parents. Okay it may not be to bad for some but my parents are so high up the pissing off scale that a whole new one has had to be invented, just for them (and fernandez who probably even beats them). The parents latest niggle is that I should get a job. That's tantamount to telling a vampire to order garlic bread with his margerita. Its just a nono. Holidays are for wasting utterly while doing sod all. They aren't for working, there is enough of that during term time  (Even for the me, especially as I ended up doing history. Read five highly interesting books on Tudor domestic policy then write a bloody essay, oh wupee). However this holiday seems to be the most action packed one I am ever going to have. This is mainly down to me going off on ccf camp which will involve a day of paintballing apparently to improve any soldierly skills any of us have. This is of course bollocks and is basically an excuse to waste teachers with paintballs (the huge irony being that one of them is an art assistant). I couldn't be arsed to find much new music today so cheated and used media player to find some for me  urlLink enjoy     In accordance with the prophesy
