      It's Friday and I knew it was when I started all this, but that means its also dinner and movie night with the wife. I'm not quite sure what we plan on going to see but the bar down the street from me, "Barrengers" is where we usually go. Barrengers make some really good steaks and my personal favorite Tenderloins...MmMmM!! Cant Wait to Eat! I'll pour the BudLight!

      Well, I Think everything went off okay lastweek with the finishing of Black Expo week. There didnt seem to be too many problems or too may arrests for that matter. I did however get a chance to see a few performers during the week.  Della Reese came thru the airport and she didnt look to well. She arrived in a wheelchair with her limo driver asking me if it was alright if he could pick her up under the awning lower level curbside United. I ofcourse granted his request and cleared traffic enough for his stretch to pick Miss Reese up.  The next day was pretty cool. I got a chance to lay eyes on the one and only Mr. LL Cool J. I grew up listening to some of his music so I was thrilled to see that he's an alright guy and that fame didnt get too much to his head.

         Saturday Morning approx: 11 o'clock and I just finished watching the time trials for the Tour de France.. I'm just amazed&nbsp;by Armstrong and the pace he has kept throughtout the 19 stages of this race. They say today that he has just confirmed his 6th win of the Tour today. Go USPS! and Most importantly Go TEAM U.S.A. !!!    Sorry, I ran off about the race in the above paragraph. My real intentions here today was to talk&nbsp; about the movie that me and the wife went to see lastnight. I would definately recommend this movie to people who love futuristic movies. I thought it was a good movie all in all, and maybe perhaps a little scary to think about what the future may hold. Lets face it. People are getting lazier and lazier and I dont think that robots are way off. Right now we as a race are relying on computers for more and more these days. In Auto plants where man used to line up for assembly they now have machines building these autos and thats not new..from my understanding these machines have been guilding cars for atleast the last 15 or so years..The problem is that..They (the machines) dont need breaks..so they build and build and the cars roll off the line better? I dont know about that. I do know however that I enjoyed the movie and that maybe those observations about assembly lines should be left with those men who work on them.    Go See The Movie. Decide for yourself!

           Being a Public Safety Officer at Indianapolis International isn't easy. There are times when I just want to say to people "Whats Wrong With You?"  Today at the good ol airport I had an issue with a small group of people that concerned two cars and about 10 people. They had half their luggage and the other half was slow to the&nbsp;baggage carousel. They figured they could sit on the curb with their cars while waiting for the rest of their luggage. Well, That isn't going to happen at Indy. You see we have a policy there. In order to stop on a yellow curb to pick up your people and their luggage, the party must be waiting outside with all of their luggage ready to load (active loading only) and if for some reason they don't have all of their luggage, unfortunately the driver has to take a lap around the airport until that party can comply with the policy. Suffice it to say, They weren't having any of that. I was told "how dare I tell them how to load their vehicle!" I went on to further explain the meaning behind ACTIVE LOADING ONLY (which in short means luggage going in, no waiting) I called for an L.E.O and explained to him what was going on and the woman rolled up her window..When I started to write the ticket and the other officer approached the window, she took off..The officer told control that he was 10-8 and walked back inside. I approached the officer and asked why he didn't do anything in his power and was basically brushed off, later to be reprimanded by the on duty LT.&nbsp;&nbsp;          I was not thrilled to say the least and I have half the mind to email the indy-star and other local papers and news stations about the laxidasical attitudes towards security at Indy... I'll keep you all informed what happens next with these issues but I got an idea that Public Safety at the airport will soon be gone...Who cares about 9-11 right? It's amazing to me how fast this country forgets about whats really important..Do they forget or is it that they dont want to be bothered???

         Well, I've been sitting here and messing with this blog to try      and make sure everything is working fine and if it isnt one      thing then its another. I had hoped to be able to publish something      everyday but while installing Halo Comment I some how messed      up the whole commenting process within blogger. I'm New to this      thing and confused...After messing with it for some time I finally      got Halo installed but now you can comment in two places...I'm lost..      Is there anyone out there following this mess that can help out      or have suggestions?

      GOD BLESS AMERICA! READ THROUGH TO UNDER THE PICTURE. This is a beautiful photo of a giant flag in Arizona. The photo is authentic and un-retouched. The picture was taken on regular Kodak 35 mm film. The person who took the picture couldn't believe the image created by the sun's rays. Nice of them to share with the world!      For those that prefer to think that God is not watching over us....go ahead and delete this. For the rest of us.....pass this on.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* And This is Me, Passing it on!

        Okay Enough about senseless shit! ie. blog setups and the like.     I originally made this blog to talk about what was going on in Indy     and haven't been able to do that because of problems with the little BS.     Actually I really started this blog to see what it would look like for a      friend that has another agenda and it turned into these ramblings.     So Here I am again facing another blank posting.. Once I get all the     noise out of my head I'll be able to sit here and write what I'm really     thinking.

       We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes; but the plural of ox became oxen not oxes. One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, yet the plural of moose should never be meese. You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice; yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. If the plural of man is always called men, why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen? If I spoke of my foot and show you my feet, and I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth? Then one may be that, and three would be those, yet hat in the plural would never be hose, and the plural of cat is cats, not cose. We speak of a brother and also of brethren, but though we say mother, we never say methren. Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, but imagine the feminine, she, shis and shim. Some other reasons to be grateful if you grew up speaking English: 1) The bandage was wound around the wound. 2) The farm was used to produce produce. 3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse. 4) We must polish the Polish furniture. 5) He could lead if he would get the lead out. 6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. 7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to present the present. 8) At the Army base, a bass was painted on the head of a bass drum. 9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes. 10) I did not object to the object. 11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid. 12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row. 13) They were too close to the door to close it. 14) The buck does funny things when the does are present. 15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line. 16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow. 17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail. 18) After a number of Novocain injections, my jaw got number. 19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear. 20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests. 21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend? 22) I spent last evening evening out a pile of dirt. Screwy pronunciations can mess up your mind! For example...If you have a rough cough, climbing can be tough when going through the bough on a tree! Let's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly,boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speaking English should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wiseguy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. If Dad is Pop, how's come Mom isn't Mop?   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* This Was Sent To Me Via Email From My Sister-inlaw Who is a Teacher

       The planes at the airport aren't the only thing flying about these days. Yep, you guessed it. Rumors. I'm getting tired of what everyone is saying about the Public Safety Program coming to a close shortly, but the more I hear the more I seem to believe that there may be some truths to these tales.  They've been doing a lot of remodeling lately, security wise at Indianapolis International. They've installed truck-traps and new permanent type shacks that with government funding is costing over 500k per. But here's the kicker....Just recently I spoke with one of the contractors and he said that they are designing them now where they can be unmanned. UNMANNED! WTF!!! What was the sense of putting the Shitter-The AC and The Heaters&nbsp;in each one of those shacks.  Also the vehicles that were bought for us to get out to some of these shacks that lay on the tug roads next to the taxi-ways and runways, will be taken away soon..The Ford Expedition is going to one of our K-9 units and the Escape is going to either the Fire Dept. or Another one of the K-9's.. either way all the tell tale signs are there...I think we're doomed. It'll be unemployment city soon for me if these rumors are right. I cant see how they cant be right.  This guy that is Vice President of Customer Service, just recently came to Indy from Britain and right away he started talking about the PSO's being more customer friendly and that we the pso's were going to be part of "Customer Service"&nbsp; even talk of new uniforms, not those ratty old navy blue bdu's ..we were going to move up in the world and wear khaki pants with some sort of shirt...whether it be a polo type or a sleeved shirt, not sure yet..but that's under scrutiny. Can you imagine having to climb up into a truck to search the inside wearing khaki pants?!?!  The next thing we know the Director of Public Safety gets up and hands in his resignation (no big loss there, the guy was a loser)  Anyway, it's been 3 weeks since this new head honcho shows up and he hasn't even made an attempt to get to know any of us. Today was actually the first day he came to roll call and introduced himself to us and that's only because the other day we had a UPS delivery man come to the airport and on his way inside the building his heart decided to give out..Who was the first uniformed officer on the scene???? A PSO! (public safety officer) The police showed up a few moments later with an AED (automatic electronic defibulator) The first two officers to start CPR were pso's recalling their training. Unfortunately though, even after everyone showed up, medics,police etc. the gentleman still expired. It was not a good day to say the least, however in some selfish reasoning..it was a good day for the pso's.&nbsp; So this guys introduction was a ploy for the Chief of Police to hand out certificates of recognition to those officers that responded to that situation. Our&nbsp;condolences do go out to the mans' family.  My point is, The Public Safety Officers aren't only the customers first point of contact but also the first impression...I know there are some officers that could use some classes on kindness, but the airport also needs to take into consideration that we were hired also as security and were trained accordingly. But it appears that Security has relaxed way too much at Indy International, and not by our doing. I've been with Public Safety now for a little over 2 years and LOVED my job until just recently..Now with all the restrictions they have placed on us..and thats another blog...believe me.... I just dont enjoy my job anymore. I'm definately experiencing&nbsp;the Security Blues.  Until Next Time..We'll be seeing you and remember if your party isn't on the curb ready to load just park the car and go inside and get them, because all we're going to do is have you paged back to your vehicle.  Boy, I miss the days when Indy's Finest Showed up with the flashing yellows and it costed you over a hundred bucks and a release form to get your car out of impound for an Unattended Vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        The Manchurian Candidate. What can I say about this movie? I think in some aspects it may have hit a little too close to home. Another NJXF is what I would call it to a friend of mine. He would understand my meaning. Conspiracy buffs are going to eat this movie alive.. It's a modern day Jacobs Ladder with a futuristic twist that still has "big brother" with the upperhand. I'm not going to give away the movie but you may want to check back here from time to time to see what I have added to this post. This IS going to be edited just as soon as I let it soak it in. I'll sit on it for a few more hours before I write what I want, but I thought the initial feelings might help for when I edit..We'll see..Check back!

      It's another Friday and for me that means SUNDAY. My Mondays are Saturdays and with this week comes the Brickyard 400...WooHoo Whipeeeee..Can you feel the sarcasm dripping from each letter that I type here. As I said before in another one of my daily ramblings about Fridays.. It's date night with the wife and that means we'll be going for dinner and a movie. what's good out there to see; and if you say   Farenheight 911  , I'm gonna shoot you! I wouldn't put a cent in the fat fuckers pocket.   MM  , can go to hell for all I care, spreading that propaganda bullshit to all the dipshits who welcome a political (democratic) genocide. Ahhhh, But   The Bourne Supremacy   is still playing isn't it? I may have to cheat and while the wife is at work rent the Bourne Identity to get the storyline back fresh in my nugget.

      When I moved to Indianapolis, I decided that I would join the National Guard and become an MP. I really enjoyed my time there but if I could change one thing about the Guard (atleast at Stout Field- 38th MP CO.) I would make sure that everyone knew the job! We would train all the time and everyone , I MEAN everyone would be proficient with their weapon. However thats not the case with The Guard. (again, atleast where I drilled) I dont understand the sitting around and not doing anything. How many times must we inventory the conex? It's not like anyone took anything out of there... Anyway, a few things happened that made me think about my situation with the 38th. I started thinking about my roots with the armed forces. I started my military career when I was seventeen in a delayed entry program with the Navy. I did four years and even spent time in the Gulf during Desert Storm. My original plan was to serve and then retire from the Navy after 20, but it didnt happen that way. Being from the East Coast originally (New Jersey) and being stationed out in Long Beach California was tuff. I wanted to be home for the holidays or atleast talk to a family member on the phone when it was possible. The four years on the West Coast really took a toll on me. I went to my PN and asked him if there was a way I could switch with someone from west to east and he looked into it, but with no bites on the swap, I took the 3 months early out program that the government was offering in those days. I really REGRET that decision everyday of my life. I'm 33 years old now and realized had I stayed in, I'd only have 4 more years until my retirement. I would be atleast an E-6 or E-7 right now. But before I moved to Indy... I was out of my service contractual obligation for about 10+ years. I came into the National Guard as an SPC4 and advancement isnt easy when the schooling I had for the Navy didnt count for anything in The Guard. Instead of waiting around forever to make SGT, I decided to go back to the Navy. Granted I joined the Naval Reserve this time, and I was not happy to say the least to hear that my SM rate (SignalMan) is no longer. They've crossed over and became QM's now. (QuarterMasters) So, I decided to try another job. I'm coming back as a SeaBee BU (Builder) I was sworn back into the Navy the other day and feel better now...Much Better Now! I still have 2 years to make up my mind but I have been thinking about going back active for awhile. I dont think my civilian job (Public Safety Officer) at the airport is going to be around that much longer, and so the clock ticks on my decision.    This is the Ship I served on when I was active all those years ago. The good old "Mighty J" FFG-33  USS JARRETT

      As you can tell, I only just started this journal a few weeks back. I never knew what a blog was until a friend of mine gave me the url of another friends blog " urlLink Daily Dose of Dave "  I Really like what I saw there and thought about adding a blog to  urlLink Tommy's PlayGround  although is doesnt show up until the PLAYGROUND2. The more I thought about this concept the more I thought it could work, but did I really have enough in me to share with everyone on a daily basis? That questions still haunts my mind. It's more or less still in an experiment to me. Theres still a few things I need to make this right. I need the knowledge on CSS and the need to change this "all ready made template" with a template of my own..so in the upcoming weeks, there should be little subtle changes to this blog and soon enough I'll call it my own.

       Made in Mexico" or canada Check some of your Heinz products. "Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened. However, he is trying to blame it on George W. Bush. As far as I know, Bush has not moved one factory out of this country because he is not the owner of a single factory. That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry. According to the Wall Street Journal,the Kerry's own 32 factories in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company, leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean. 80% of Heinz products are made overseas. I wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated in foreign countries. I also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States. Of course they're not However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner? If Kerry is elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America? Of course they won't. They're making millions off that cheap labor.

      Has Anyone Seen This Site??  urlLink http://www.georgebush.ca/index.php  I emailed the idiots and put my 2cents in about why a Canadian (of all people) should have an opinion about America!  His Response to my email:  Since as you said we are all entitled to an opinion.For the sake of the world Lose Bush Lose!How can you say Leave America to America when America runs around the world 'doing good' they have not been asked to do? You can't have it both ways Tommy. You currently do. But most people wish you didn't.Thanks for the note,Warren  Me: Well Warren, Think about it this way if it werent for America, A lot of countries would be slaves..When were asked to do something and believe me it's quite frequently ..We do..And just think about this...Ever wonder why nobody messes with Canada..Yep..Cause The Eagle guards your borders too

Which brings me   to my question.   Has Anyone Tryed   to carve out out lettering in their lawns before? I'm sitting here rolling at the idea and wonder if I can with a simple regular push mower.    The Shit you think up on a day off when you're bored huh? But if I try it...I'll post a picture with the results...LOLOL!!!

      It's Saturday and I'm not looking foward to going in to work. It's amazing at the type of fans that are drawn to these racing events here in Indianapolis. The air at the airport is so thick you can almost cut it with a butter knive. And I believe all this hype had started in, sometime last week. Last Wednesday was a normal day at the airport with the traffic being heavy at times, but after some idiot tryed to run me over because I issued him a citation for parking, it all went downhill from there..You can just feel the hype growing in the air and building up for this event. Oooo Fun, I can hardly wait until tomorrow when this race is over and all the weird ones have gone back under their rock. (Now, dont get me wrong..I'm not saying EVERYBODY that likes NASCAR is that weird...Just those individuals I'm dealing with at the airport are!)

      Well it's monday morning and my head is spinning. I'm not quite sure I'm awake enough to be sitting here and typing. I have a few things around the house to get accomplished today before I have to get ready for work and I'll tell you this...I'm feeling pretty lazy too. I'm so glad the race is over. Traffic should be at its normal capacity today. All the race fans have left the building and most of them are on their way back to Southern Indiana or Kentucky. Sorry I didnt mean to profile there, just thought I might get a laugh at that one. Nascar fans are something else..I have to admit it.

      I'm Not exactly sure why this comment  hasn't  showed up anywhere..Atleast that I can find, and I've gone thru my archives looking for it. But Today  urlLink The Low Down  received this post, so in good faith I'm gonna make this a regular post and not a comment...To The Author of this comment..Please Next Time Leave your name!  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*   As the H.J. Heinz Company reports in its most recent proxy statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Heinz Kerry is not on the company's board of directors, nor is she listed among the principal shareholders (those who control 5% or more of the outstanding shares). The charitable foundations she controls once held much more Heinz stock but sold off most of it nearly a decade ago to diversify their investments. The Heinz company said in a recent public statement that she currently controls less than 4% of the company's stock. The largest shareholder is actually a California investment company that owns roughly three times as much as the Heinz charitable foundations.About all that is true in this e-mail is that the Heinz company has a number of factories overseas.Its most recent annual report, also publicly available at the SEC's website, lists 32 factories owned in Europe (and three more leased), and 18 in Asia and the Pacific (plus four more leased). Heinz also reported selling just over $3 billion in products in Europe and more than $1 billion more in Asia and the Pacific -- accounting for roughly half the company's global sales.The company issued a statement back in March, when this e-mail first began circulating, saying that 60% of its sales are outside the US (including those in Mexico and Canada as well as Europe and Asia) and that it locates plants in other countries "to accommodate those customers by providing facilities closer to those markets" and "to pack the freshest ingredients, tailor its recipes to local tastes and deliver the final products in a timely and efficient manner."The company also distanced itself from the Kerry campaign and Heinz Kerry:H.J. Heinz Co: In light of some misleading speculation, the H. J. Heinz Company would like to make clear that neither Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry, Senator John Kerry nor any member of their family is involved in the management or board of the H. J. Heinz Company. . . . They have no involvement in the Heinz® Ketchup business or any of the company’s other brands or products.The Heinz company also said it is "nonpartisan." Worth noting, however, is that the company's Political Action Committee has given nearly all its donations to Republican candidates, including $5,000 to the Bush campaign and nothing to Kerry's as of the most recent reports available. That's additional evidence, as if any was needed, that the company isn't "owned" by Kerry's wife.SourcesHeinz Endowments, "The Heinz Endowments Grants to Tides Center / Tides Foundation," news release, undated.Howard Heinz Endowment, IRS Form 990PF, fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002.Vira I Heinz Endowment, a Pennsylvania Non Profit Corp, IRS Form 990PF, fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002.Gretchen Randall and Tom Randall, "The Tides Foundation: Liberal Crossroads of Money and Ideas," Foundation Watch, Capital Research Center, Washington DC, December 2003.Tom Randall, "The Heinz Endowments have teamed with a secretive left-wing group ," Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , 14 Dec. 14, 2003.

      When I am Old...  I shall wear Turquoise and soft gray sweatshirts...  and a bandana over my silver hair...  and I shall spend my Social Security Checks  on Sweet Wine and My Dogs...  and sit in my house on my well-worn chair,  and listen to my dog's breathing.  I will sneak out in the middle of a warm Summer night  and take my dogs for a run, if my old bones will allow...    and when people come to call,  I will smile and nod as I show them my dogs...  and talk of them and about them...  The Ones so Beloved of the Past  and the Ones so Beloved of Today....  I still will work hard cleaning after them  and mopping and feeding them  and whispering their names in a soft, loving way.  I will wear their gleaming sweat on my throat like a jewel,  and I will be an embarrassment to all...  and my family...  who have not yet found the peace in being free  to have dogs as your Best Friends....  These friends who always wait,  at any hour, for your footfall...  and eagerly jump to their feet out of a sound sleep,  to greet you as if you are a God.  With warm eyes full of adoring love  and hope that you will stay and hug their big, strong necks... and  kiss their dear sweet heads... and whisper to them of your love and the  beautiful pleasure of their very special company....  I look in the Mirror...  and see I am getting old....  this is the kind of woman I am...  and have always been.  Loving dogs is easy, they are part of me,  accept me for who I am,  my dogs appreciate my presence in their lives...  when I am old this will be important to me...  you will understand when you are old....  and if you have dogs to love too.

      The baggy yellow shirt had long sleeves, four extra-large pockets trimmed in black thread and snaps up the front. It was faded from years of wear, but still in decent shape. I found it in 1963 when I was home from college on Christmas break, rummaging through bags of clothes Mom intended to give away. "You're not taking that old thing, are you?" Mom said when she saw me packing the yellow shirt. "I wore that when I was pregnant with your brother in 1954!" "It's just the thing to wear over my clothes during art class, Mom. Thanks!" I slipped it into my suitcase before she could object. The yellow shirt became a part of my college wardrobe. I loved it. After graduation, I wore the shirt the day I moved into my new apartment and on Saturday mornings when I cleaned. The next year, I married. When I became pregnant, I wore the yellow shirt during big-belly days. I missed Mom and the rest of my family, since we were in Colorado and they were in Illinois. But that shirt helped. I smiled, remembering that Mother had worn it when she was pregnant, 15 years earlier. That Christmas, mindful of the warm feelings the shirt had given me, I patched one elbow, wrapped it in holiday paper and sent it to Mom. When Mom wrote to thank me for her "real" gifts, she said the yellow shirt was lovely. She never mentioned it again. The next year, my husband, daughter and I stopped at Mom and Dad's to pick up some furniture. Days later, when we uncrated the kitchen table, I noticed something yellow taped to its bottom. The shirt! And so the pattern was set. On our next visit home, I secretly placed the shirt under Mom and Dad's mattress. I don't know how long it took for her to find it, but almost two years passed before I discovered it under the base of our living-room floor lamp. The yellow shirt was just what I needed now while refinishing furniture. The walnut stains added character. In 1975 my husband and I divorced. With my three children, I prepared to move back to Illinois. As I packed, a deep depression overtook me. I wondered if I could make it on my own. I wondered if I would find a job. I paged through the Bible, looking for comfort. In Ephesians, I read, "So use every piece of God's armor to resist the enemy whenever he attacks, and when it is all over, you will be standing up." I tried to picture myself wearing God's armor, but all I saw was the stained yellow shirt. Slowly, it dawned on me. Wasn't my mother's love a piece of God's armor? My courage was renewed. Unpacking in our new home, I knew I had to get the shirt back to Mother. The next time I visited her, I tucked it in her bottom dresser drawer. Meanwhile, I found a good job at a radio station. A year later I discovered the yellow shirt hidden in a rag bag in my cleaning closet. Something new had been added. Embroidered in bright green across the breast pocket were the words "I BELONG TO PAT." Not to be outdone, I got out my own embroidery materials and added an apostrophe and seven more letters. Now the shirt proudly proclaimed, "I BELONG TO PAT'S MOTHER." But I didn't stop there. I zig-zagged all the frayed seams, then had a friend mail the shirt in a fancy box to Mom from Arlington, VA. We enclosed an official looking letter from "The Institute for the Destitute," announcing that she was the recipient of an award for good deeds. I would have given anything to see Mom's face when she opened the box. But, of course, she never mentioned it. Two years later, in 1978, I remarried. The day of our wedding, Harold and I put our car in a friend's garage to avoid practical jokers. After the wedding, while my husband drove us to our honeymoon suite, I reached for a pillow in the car to rest my head. It felt lumpy. I unzipped the case and found, wrapped in wedding paper, the yellow shirt. Inside a pocket was a note: "Read John 14:27-29. I love you both, Mother." That night I paged through the Bible in a hotel room and found the verses: "I am leaving you with a gift: peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give isn't fragile like the peace the world gives. So don't be troubled or afraid. Remember what I told you: I am going away, but I will come back to you again. If you really love me, you will be very happy for me, for now I can go to the Father, who is greater than I am. I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do, you will believe in me." The shirt was Mother's final gift. She had known for three months that she had terminal Lou Gehrig's disease. Mother died the following year at age 57. I was tempted to send the yellow shirt with her to her grave. But I'm glad I didn't, because it is a vivid reminder of the love-filled game she and I played for 16 years. Besides, my older daughter is in college now, majoring in art. And every art student needs a baggy yellow shirt with big pockets.  You have 6 minutes.... There's some mighty fine advice in these words, even if you're not superstitious. You will receive good luck within four days of relaying this message. Do not keep this message. It must leave your hands in 6 MINUTES. Otherwise you will get a very unpleasant surprise. This is true, even if you are not superstitious, agnostic, or otherwise faith impaired. ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully. TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as Important as any other. THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want. FOUR. When you say, "I love you," mean it. FIVE. When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye. SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married. SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight. EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much. NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely. TEN.. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling. ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives TWELVE. Talk slowly but think quickly. THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?" FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk. FIFTEEN. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze. SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; and Responsibility for all your actions. EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship. NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it. TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice. TWENTY-ONE. Spend some time alone.  Now, here's the FUN part! Send this to at least 5 people and your life will improve. 1-4 people: Your life will improve slightly. 5-9 people: Your life will improve to your liking. 9-14 people: You will have at least 5 surprises in the next 3 weeks 15 and above: Your life will improve drastically and everything you ever dreamed of will begin to take shape. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* How Many People Do you Think This Counts For? And So I pass This On!

      Here is an extract of a message sent to me, thought you might  find it interesting...   There were 39 combat related killings in Iraq during the month of  January.. In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders in the month of  January... thats just one American city, about as deadly as the entire  war torn country of  Iraq.   When some claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war, state the following; FDR, led us into World War II.  450,000 lives were lost an average of 112,500 per year. Truman, finished that war and started one in Korea, North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost an average of 18,334 per year.   John F. Kennedy, started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us.  Johnson, turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975,  58,000 lives were lost an average of 5,800 per year.  Clinton, went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent,  He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.  In the two years since terrorists attacked us President Bush has, liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people.  The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but, It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch  Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records.  It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick.  It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!!  Wait, there's more..........JOHN GLENN ON THE SENATE FLOOR.  Some people still don't understand why military personnel do what they do for a living. This exchange between Senators John Glenn and Senator Howard Metzenbaum is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive impromptu speech, but it's also a good example of one man's explanation of why men and women in the armed services do what they do for a living. This IS a typical, though sad, example of what some who have never served think of the military. Senator Metzenbaum to Senator Glenn: "How can you run for Senate when you've never held a real job?" Senator Glenn: "I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps. I served through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire on 12 different occasions. I was in the space program. It wasn't my checkbook, Howard; it was my life on the line. It was not a nine-to-five job, where I took time off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with me ... as I went the other day to a veteran's hospital and look those men - with their mangled bodies -in the eye, and tell THEM they didn't hold a job! You go with me to the Space Program at NASA and go, as I have gone, to the widows and orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee... and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their DADS didn't hold a job. You go with me on Memorial Day and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery, where I have more friends buried than I'd like to remember, and you watch those waving flags. You stand there, and you think about this nation, and you tell ME that those people didn't have a job? I'll tell you,  Howard Metzenbaum; you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men - SOME MEN - who held REAL jobs. And they required a dedication to a purpose - and a love of country and a dedication to duty - that was more important than life itself. Andtheir self-sacrifice is what made this country possible. I HAVE held a job, Howard!  What about you? "For those who don't remember - During W.W.II,  Howard Metzenbaum was an attorney representing the Communist Party in the USA. Now he is a Senator!  If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you are reading it in English thank a Veteran !!

      Two good ol' boys, Bubba and Junior get promoted from Privates to Sergeants. Not long after, they're out for a walk and Bubba says, "Hey, Junior -there's the NCO Club. Let's you and me stop in and have us a drank. ""But we's privates," protests Junior. "NO, we's sergeants now," says Bubba, pulling him inside "Now, Junior, I'm gonna sit down and have me a drank. ""But, we's privates," says Junior. "You blind, boy!" says Bubba, pointing at his stripes. "We's Sergeants now!" So they order their drinks and pretty soon a hooker comes up to Bubba. "You're cute," she says, "and I'd like to take you someplace and make you feel good -- but I've got a bad case of gonorrhea. "Bubba pulls his friend to the side and whispers,  "Junior, go look in the dictionary and see what that gonorrhea means. If it's good, give me the okay sign. "Junior goes to look it up, comes back, and gives Bubba the big okay sign. Three weeks later Bubba is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case ofgonorrhea. "Junior," he says, "What you give me the okay for?! ""Well Bubba, in the dictionary, it says gonorrhea only affects the privates."Then he pointed to his stripes and says, "But we's Sergeants now!

      You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American. So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an American is, so they would know when they found one.  (Good on ya mate!!!!) An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans. An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they  are free to worship as each of them chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God. An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person the pursuit of happiness. An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need.  When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country.! As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in  Afghanistan. Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are  the people who built America. Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001 earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists. So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did.  So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world. But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place.  They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.
