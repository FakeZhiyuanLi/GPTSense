       I think the both of them are a great match. One juz doesn't noe it...Too bad. You might noe who im talkin' bout'. I don't care. But...oh, never mind! I can't type this out. I can't...I can't...I can't...SOME PEOPLE are juz so grouchy. They always spoil the fun, eat everything up, dirty pratically almost everything around!! THEY think THEY are the " biggest " among us all, so what?! Grouchy, grumbling, dirty people.
