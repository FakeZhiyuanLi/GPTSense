      Had a very successful shopping day yesterday.  Catherine has been invited to Buckingham Palace for a garden party and wanted the best personal shopper she knows to help her find  THE  outfit.  We did.  After a faltering start in Monsoon where not one dress seemed to fall right (the problems of the fuller figured woman who is size 12-14 and 5'10"....not fat but has a figure in all the right places)we popped into East and it was like all Catherine's dream clothes in one store.  Everything fitted and mostly she had to go to a size 12.  Got coat, dress, sandals, hat, bag, jewellery and tried on lots more.  What a result.  In celebration I had to buy myself a lovely pink linen dress from Coast.  Then the rain started and we lunched.  Headed home in the sunshine.  Had a little G&T and the heavens opened.  No gardening happened again.  Instead made strawberry sorbet and a kind of strawberry shortcake with almond based biscuits.  Lovely.  This morning was beautiful and warm.  Hope it stays this way so I can garden this evening after spinning.  Or shall I just go to bed?

      Yet another Saturday when I was not able to get into the garden and finish planting out my final plants.  So pleased with the strong winds and the huge amount of tree debris scattered across the lawn from the weeping willow.  Plus with this rain the new fencing is  not  getting painted.  It was with great delight on Thursday morning that I noticed the fence, upon which one of our neighbour's has been resting a large roll of old carpet, was still standing due to the heavy duty netting I'd put up a couple of weeks ago.  They are horrible slobs.  Their conservatory is filled with junk.  Along with the carpet leaning against the fence there's a selection of wicker(which is fundamentally wrong) furniture and other household detritus.  Polite requests for them to remove the offending items has resulted in no action whatsoever.  What did I expect from a man who we can often hear wretching in the early hours of the morning after a few too many beers.  I did have a little revenge when I accidentally, yes really!, caught him with the sprinkler whilst he was having a fag outside his backdoor.  Probably sat on a wicker (shudder!) chair.  Concerning the flowers, I have a few more morning glories (yeah!) and the convolvulus are starting to flower along with the poached egg plants.  These look wonderful together and will definitely use them together in a pot for the patio in years to come.  I am really delighted with how they look and it was a complete accident that they ended up anywhere near each other.  My favourite gardening.  The poppies are coming on a treat and it can only be a matter of days before flowering begins.  The jasmine has started flowering but it'll be another week when all this wet weather has moved on before we get the benefit of their delicious smell wafting into the house of a morning.  On the other hand the night scented stock has been a real treat the past 2 evenings.  But not tonight....although I've just looked out the window and the sun has started to shine.  I'll be out in a few minutes to savour their lovely spicy scent.  I'll really miss them when I'm on holiday in a couple of weeks.  Mind you northern Provence has beautiful scents at all times of the day so I shouldn't be contemplating such thoughts!  Have been painting Simon's home built furniture.  I am so pleased that I seem to have an eye for being able to see a paint colour and be able to choose the exact shade to match Simon's requirements.  I might be terrible at some things but I do have a talent for colours.  Move over heads of the UN....do you not think the world would be a better place if we could only match the exact shades of colour more accurately?  Still having fun with my new toy....DELL AXIM.  Even signed up for Instant Messenging.  I'll be all techno-ed out by Monday.  Off to the night scented stocks....and more I hope!

      Marvellous, due to the downpour from yesterday evening, which I completely missed due to being virtuous in the gym, I haven't needed to water the garden.  What a result.  It meant I was able to watch the second half of the England game uninterrupted.  Still haven't seen any Oldham flags in any of the games yet.  Maybe during the quarter final.  There's no new flowers for me to admire and nurture this morning.  Apart from the persistantly flowering rock rose.  It's just so lovely and so pink.  I loved it's delicious scent when we had the scorchio weather the other week.  It's a shame having to walk between it and my bay trees when it's warm.  Had an email from Bibi this morning.  Her washing machine lost it's door last night, probably due to the shock of England's 4-2 win over Croatia.  Apparently she only has 2 pairs of clean pants left.  I replied with the following:   I have an unopened pack of 5 pairs of knickers as my emergency knickers.  Since I lived with boys at university and learning all about their emergency pants (really very horrid) and the all other boys I've known since have had the same emergency pants problems I decided that there would be a full packet of crisp, clean never worn before emergency pants for me.  I even have a couple of unopened ones in my gym bag just in case I forget my knickers for getting changed post workout.  I learnt my lesson from once forgetting my knickers.     Is it any wonder I think I've got too much clutter!  Can't believe that we're due stupid amounts of rain and the change in temperature over the past couple of days.  I've socks AND shoes on and my feet are cold.  And it's officially summer. As busybody know-it-alls often say to my horror and amusement....it beggars belief!  Not quite as amusing as "it's political correctness gone mad" though!

      Got home yesterday and was sadly disappointed by my crimson rambler morning glories.  Not crimson.  And not glorious.  Unlike the Knowlian black morning glories which are very deep velvety purple and  are  glorious.  My idea was that the crimson colour would pick up the crimson throat of the darker flower.  Sadly no.  On top of that because I'd grown so many plants, again, I've been distributing them to all my friends and how am I going to explain that the beautiful bright pink is a dark burgundy which clashes everso slightly with the darker purple.  I've been very disappointed with the thinning out I did on my big flower border.  Hardly any of the transplanted little seedlings survived during the heat of last week.  Poor things.  I always get a little anxious when I can't get a plant to recover from a drought setback.  Plus my sweetpeas have been a disaster.  I dug in sooo much poo to improve the soil as sweetpeas love it -they do-but to no avail.  Whenever I've grown them before they've been flowering by now.  I dug them up and their root system was smaller than when I planted them out.  The amazing invisible roots.  Thank heavens for my achillea which is flowering in many shades of pink, from fuschia to white with a hint of pink.  These are my faves from the wild flower packet of seeds I sowed last year.  Sent off my CV today for a job for which I am wholly suitable and it's in the same town as I live.....I've not had that option since I left London 7 years ago.  Would love to be in that position.  And in a non-field based job.  Career development.  Why did I ever go there?  Looking forward to more new flowers tomorrow.....maybe my poppies will start to make an appearance!

      Oh! What a day.  Firstly, did  LOADS  of gardening yesterday.  Lots of lovely planting and digging poo into soil.  But still lovely.  Had fab start to the day.  A little gyming and bodypump.  Had to rush around and get to the Lanesborough for 12.00-12.30.  Clive and Jayne arrived at 1pm which is when we had to leave for 140 Park Lane.  Richard,  Mat and Eating and Drinking met us there.  Which was lovely.  Had a great meal and in particular the strawberry cheesecake and chocolate sorbet was fabulous.  Drank far too much wine.  E&D got stressy about missing his train and Simon got stressy about me taking charge.  Boys.  So much fun yet so much looking after required.  How does this relate to gardening?
