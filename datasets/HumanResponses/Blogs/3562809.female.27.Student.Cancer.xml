      All people are multi-layered--onions, if you will, or parfaits (which Donkey & I are both fans of).  Some people take awhile to warm up to new people, easing into new acquaintanceships slowly, like one might inch into an icy lake.  They aren't unsociable or rude, these folks, they just have a more reserved nature.  Likewise, there are people who will behave amiably enough right away, but prefer to keep things on a slightly superficial level.  They may be very deep on the inside, but they are more comfortable engaging in very light small talk.  Pleasant enough to converse with for a spell, but you don't get a real sense of substance.  Then there are those rare people who, from the first time you meet them, completely engage you.  They cannonball into friendship with unabashed enthusiasm, embracing you with both arms and taking you along for the ride.  From the moment you meet, there are no awkward silences or contrivances.  They insist on seeing right to the messy core of you,  celebrating each quirk along the way, and returning the favor.  They challenge, delight, and stimulate each cell in your brain, and leave your soul feeling overflowing, alive, and happy.  After spending ten minutes in their company, you are already looking forward to the next dozen times you will spend together.   Thank you, A & N!

      Cue the evil laughter!  My retarded neighbors (the loud sex ones, not the loud foreign-language ones) have Blink-182 crap blasting forth this afternoon.  Or maybe it's one of those other number bands... I don't know, they all sound the same to me.  I do have a "modern rock" station on the #6 button in my car, but for the life of me I don't know why.  Tuning into it is usually like hearing tinfoil put through a cheese grater.  I can tune into an R&B station, or even most classic rock stations, and within 1 second I can tell what song it is.  But this modern rock stuff, it takes a good 12 to 15 seconds to even place a beat!  As a busy girl, I don't have time for this type of complexity in my life!  If I did, I'd call up my most devoted ex and spend an hour debating with a brick wall. But revenge is sweet.  On comes Music Choice!  For those cable-impaired, Music Choice is the 30-or-so channels of straight music, arranged in categorized channels.  I think the Party Favorites channel will do nicely, heh heh heh.  Ah, lovely, BlackBox!!!  Volume up, babies!  Ah... it don't get any better than this.  Cue more evil laughter & self-satisfied smirk.

        I have discovered that the best way to edit one's belongings is while a bit tipsy.  That's right, a little tichy-tichy gets those organizational vibes flowing right along.  That same lovely carefree feeling that prompts one to tell perfect strangers, "I love you!" comes in handy when tossing out half the contents of one's closets.  Dresses, skirts, sweaters, happily bounce into Hefty-land, tra-la-la!  It's more difficult to remember the emotional ties to certain wardrobe pieces, so out they go!  Another side-effect of alcohol intake is the sharpened memories of ex-boyfriends.  The ghosts of men past swoop through, whispering, "ah, yes... the dress you wore on the first date with J ..."  Out, out, out it must go!   I know, once the imbibing has begun, it can be a challenge to leave the couch (and the Mad TV marathon) behind.  Efficient, useful activity is not the most appealing concept when in that happy-go-lucky state of mind.  But trust me, you will thank yourself in the morning!  Just remember, although you may load the bags destined for Goodwill into the car while you're on that nice wobbly roll, wait til you're sober to drop them off.

        Really, I am.  But probably not in the way you're thinking.  Let's keep our minds in a PG-rated place, people!  So then, I mean this pretty darn literally, actually.  When it comes to sickness, injury, convalescence in general, I'm what you might call a trail blazer.  I've never broken an arm, had pnuemonia, or mono.  Although in high school I used to long for mono... nothing sounded more appealing to my teenage self than being forced to sleep all day.  Actually, that still does hold some appeal, but now I have to pay my own bills, so scratch that thought.   No, when I go down, it always seems to be some crazy little thing gone awry.  The only bone I ever broke was in my left ring finger, when I was 15.  I was upstairs in my bedroom, and suddenly became filled with righteous rage at my mother for reasons I could not remember if I tried.  In my indignance, I attempted to descend the staircase while simultaneously stomping and hurrying.  Not a great combo for the stairs.  My foot caught on one of those carpet-pieces that people bond to the tops of steps, and in an effort to catch myself, I flung a hand out to the bannister--not so much in a grab, but in more of a flailing 'smack'.    But wait, it gets better!  The x-rays revealed that the bone had pretty much 'poofed'.  They gave it a few months to heal, but it never got around to it.  So I had to go into surgery, where they took a slice of bone from my hip and fashioned a new finger bone.  Yes, that's right, I broke my stupid finger and ended up having surgery.   Then there's the bikini-line saga.  Yeah, most gals get an ingrown at some point.  No biggie, right?  You tweeze the sucker, clean it out with some rubbing alcohol, maybe rub in a little Neosporin, and you're good to go!  Ah yes, unless you're me.  I did all the above, but it kept getting more and more inflamed, and in a couple of days I had a fever and chills.  I take my happy self to the ER, where they give me antibiotics and send me home.  The next day, the thing is the size of a golf ball (I know, sexy, right?), and I'm feeling like leftover death casserole.  I traipse back to the ER, where they see fit to 'debride' it.  Don't be fooled... debriding does sound (to those of us medically uneducated) like something that would happen in a bodice-ripper.  Alas, it's nothing of the sort.  It was, bar none, the most painful time in my life thus far.  They should really knock people out for this sort of thing.  So they chopped me all up but good and sent me home for a few more days of feeling horrible and two weeks of not being able to swim.  Yes, all this from a bikini-line ingrown.  Say it with me ladies... shave WITH the grain, never against!!!   Fast forward to now.  Over the weekend my nose got sore-ish.  I figured it was the beginning stages of a pimple, one of those that take a few days to show up, but then you finally can get a good satisfying pop out of.  I decided to let it run its course, but yesterday it was really getting painful.  I tried popping it, to no avail, as it's inside my nostril.  Each time I got close, the tears running down my face made my fingers slip, dagnabit.  So with my part-time roomie falling off the couch laughing at me, I went to the Urgent Care clinic (which I've found is much faster, and cheaper, than the ER.  I recommend it!).  Turns out I have an ingrown nose hair!  Ew!  Since girls aren't supposed to even HAVE nose hair, this is particularly alarming.  Fortunately, they opted against debriding for the time being, opting instead to give me drugs that are magically supposed to make it all better.  They also make me higher than a kite, but that's another story.   Maybe someday I'll get a nice ordinary malady.  Strep throat perhaps, a nice sprained ankle.  Something that when people ask, "what's wrong?" won't require an explanation.  Til then, I'll just get sick in my own uniquely complicated way.  Time to go breathe in some moist heat and take more drugs.  In lieu of flowers, send sweet & sour chicken.

        Eating sushi today, I realized I'm actually starting to get a little burnt out on it.  I started craving some good ol' American Comfort Food.  Which led me to the grand inspiration of...  Comfort Sushi!  Think of it, there are endless possibilities!  I, for one, would be first in line for a KFC Roll (consisting of fried chicken, mac 'n cheese, maybe a lil slaw or gravy).  It could be wrapped in some sort of biscuit compound (or better yet, cornbread, mmm).  What about a Thanksgiving Roll, with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, wrapped in a tiny dinner roll?  Pot Roast Roll, with nice tender roast, mashed taters & gravy?     Sure, we love to make sandwiches out of our leftovers, but I'm envisioning the Comfort Sushi as much more sophisticated.  Everything trimmed just so, wrapped nice and snug and precisely sliced up in cute little circles of happiness.   And fresh, too, as sushi oughtta be.  Aren't you craving it?  No?!  Shoot, let me pick up a sushi-making kti & a bucket meal from KFC.  I'll figure out the details & give you a ring when it's ready.

        I mean, really.  Damn.  Ya know, I do like her perfume (it's not my signature fragrance, but I do wear it).  And at least someone with a bigger butt than mine is famous, which is nice.  But she's still a big ol' hoochy mama.  I know, I know, it's not nice to judge, so I'm not, just casually observing.  I think she needs help... maybe a sesh or two with Dr. Phil?  Better yet, she should read some SARK.  She's like Liz, but 40 years ahead of schedule!     While I'm being horrid, can I ask why Friendster is so painfully slow, even on a cable connection?  Ah well, at least it's free, & I do love the whole concept.  If you know me & you're not on it, feel free to email me & demand to be put on.  It's TEE-riffic.  As it turns out, I don't actually have that many friends, but once you get 2 or 3 degrees away from me, you can meet some wonderful people, all over this land!   And what is the DEAL with only PC-ers being able to upload photos to this blog site??  If I can figure out a way 'round that, I'd love to spiff things up around here a bit.  In the meantime, you can pull up my pic in another window & position it alongside this one for that lovely effect of me blabbing straight at you.  Isn't that better?

         Is it even referred to as an entry?  Or is that redundant?  I suppose I really ought to do more homework before jumping right into this, but my manic lil self can't pay attention that long.  I will apologize once, up front, for the following:  excessive use of exclamation points, emoticons (those smiley face thingies), really long run-on sentences with way too many commas, & any other little writing flaws that bug you.  There, now I'm covered!!!  :) :) :)  Hahahahaha...    So, here I am, blogging my little heart out.  Woohoo!  So now what?      Let me wallow for a moment in the coolness of the Raleigh dwelling I'm hoping to move into in the next month.  Huge pool, huge fitness center, lovely little bushes and trees.  And let's not forget, it's right handy to some PRIME shopping territory!  Hoo-boy, I may end up broke, but me & my house are gonna look fab-u-lous!  Now to cross the fingers and hope I get in.      There is something so hopeful about moving to a new place.  Ah yes, leaving all the clutter and bad habits and neighbors who have sex loudly at 3:00am (on one side) or stand outside talking loudly on their cell phones late at night in a foreign language (other side).  Yessiree, when I move to the new place, I will leave all my clutter and mess behind.  I won't even put it in a box to be moved.  Due to my newfound organizational skills and heartless decluttering, Thenewplace will be a pristine haven of order...maybe even slightly minimalist!      I will not be a hermit or too shy to meet the neighbors, because in Thenewplace my neighbors will all be super-cool.  I'll host wine-tastings, martini parties, Superbowl parties, and a Kentucky Derby bash (I'll even learn to make mint juleps, handy lil hostess that I am).  I may even make a great friend in the neighborhood, and he or she will come over Saturday nights for dinner.  We'll listen to "Prairie Home Companion" and "This American Life", laugh our butts off, and drink wine while we cook.    And at Thenewplace, the walls will not remain mostly bare for months on end.  I will finally get all the quirky "art" I've amassed properly matted and framed for display.  I'll even go on ebay and get some of that groovy original art I've been eyeing.  Ah yes, Thenewplace will not only be sleekly neat and divinely organized, it will also be a showcase for my fabulous eclectic style.  People will enter and be struck by my clever, artistic, pleasing, and unique sensibilities.  I may even be referred as a designer.  Cottage industry in the making?  Why not!   While I'm at it, I think the changes will keep on coming.  Why, simply being in a space so terrific, I'll be literally INSPIRED to floss daily, remove eye makeup daily, and use that really expensive face cream each night before retiring.  Ah yes, I'll also practice some soothing yoga stretches each night.  And how can one ever let a single dish clutter the sink when living so right?      That's right, all my idiosyncracies will be magically cured by Thenewplace.  You can't deny, there is such a great feeling of pulling up stakes & making a fresh start.  Moving gives me more hope, more cause for resolution, than the dawn of a New Year (which, let's face it, largely consists of sleeping off the champagne and then stumbling into the nearest diner for a great combo of carbs, fat, and caffeine...yummm).    Blissful sleepy time about to commence.  The question... to preview, save as draft, or publish?  Aw heck, let this be your first lesson in Rebecca.  I'm not a huge fan of previewing, or drafting.  I like to just throw a thing out, with a big flourish & happy "Ta-Da!"  The result is much more fun that way.  The only thing I may tweak are unintentional spelling errors, if I catch 'em later.  Course, I don't even know if I can do that, as I didn't read the directions for this thing.  Oops.  Nighty-night!  :)

        My public service announcement to the world:  it can be hazardous to your health to listen to the R&B station during the lunch hour flashback, especially if you're in the shower attempting leg shavage.  Damn, I was just getting started, angling the blade just so, all slippery with this olive oil shave-goo, when Kriss Kross came on with "Jump!  Jump!"  I think, 'this must be a tag for a commercial; there's no way they're going to actually play the entire song.'  But no, the entire song blared forth from my shower radio (which I had to have because 25 minutes of relative silence was just unbearable).     Yes, most ordinary folks would find it high-near impossible to simultaneously shave & spazz out in a nostalgic booty-shake (at least not without slicing their legs to ribbons).  But me, well, I'm just that good.  Nary a nick or scrape... not even any missed spots!  Except for the knees, & who on earth can ever get knees completely smooth?!  I swear, I can go over them in 17 different directions and get out for the 30-minute lotion applying routine that blesses my day, & STILL find spots of stubble.  Grrrrrrrr!!!!!!  The plan was to Nair them (knee-nair, hehehe), but I keep forgetting.   Then there's that new lotion that's supposed to make the hair on your legs stop growing.  I got it, of course, because I'm a beauty-product-aholic.  But each time I use it, I wonder.  Don't bad things like radiation and illness make hair stop growing?  Hmmm... there's a pretty thought.  Ah well, we all have our stubborn vices.  You know, those smokers that say all tough:  "well, ya gotta die from somethin'!  you could get run over in the street tomorrow!"  Yep, that's me, with my leg defuzzing lotion... throwing caution to the wind!  Hey, ya gotta die from somethin'!  Why not from creepy lotion?  I'm such a badass.  Hey, that wasn't meant to be funny.  Grr.

      Well, it's campaign time, when we should take inventory of the things most important to us and determine which candidate lines up closest to those issues.  I was all set to vote for Kerry, until he kept us waiting in the hot July Carolina sun for 5+ hours.  Oh, he's still the top choice, being able to pronounce "nuclear" and all, but I think there's one thing that could turn the tide.  My vote will go to the candidate that brings back Government Cheese.  That's right, that pale orange rectangular block of dairy goodness.  Somehow much more flavorful than anything sold by Kraft, and reassuring in its solidness.  No pre-slicing here, boys and girls... you could slice it up yourself to whatever size you chose.  Now, is that Democracy or what?  The freedom to slice!  Oo, I'm getting goosebumps!  If you've never tasted Government Cheese, you may think I'm overstating its grandeur.  But I assure you, I am not!  Blessed with an aunt who received the stuff on a regular basis and was generous enough to share it with my mom, I am one of those who still longs for that mellow, slightly cheddary taste.  This was REAL cheese, not the "cheese food" that is sold package by crinkly package in the dairy aisle.  It complimented macaroni to perfection, and offset bologna with a subtle tang that simply made one beam with delight.  And "I'm not the only one" dreaming of those sweet days of Government Cheese; anyone who knows will agree.  I mentioned it to my roommate once, as we were sitting on the couch drinking beer, and he nearly fell off the couch in a moment of recognition (well, and laughter too... he'd had a few more than I).  We found a new point to bond over as we reminisced about Government Cheese.  Perhaps we should start a grassroots movement:  Americans for the Reinstatement of Government Cheese!  ARGC!  All sympathizers, let's plan a rally to announce our support for whomever can rise above the muck of policy and bring back the cheese!

        While walking my dog tonight, I noticed that one of my neighbors (just 'round the corner in my 'plex!) has a Kerry Edwards sign in the window.  This made me break into a bright grin & squeal a quiet "heck yeah!"  That makes two, including mine, that I know of, but I am an optimist.  My upstairs neighbor's Bush sign hasn't been up for a couple of weeks.  Hmm... maybe he needs a new sign?
