      wooh... Saturday's always fun, right? well, I'm babysitting all day, I'm getting two packs of ciggarettes (Camel Turkish blends :) ) and a 24 pack of beer for Mike, Jon, Jereme, and myself, 6 beers each (some might not have all of their's, so more for Jereme and myself! :). yeah... it's really boring at their house, so I brought them to mine... Mike's coming over, and Jon and Jereme are later too. I gotta go though... I'm supposed to watch them, not the computer screen... later.

      School, duh... it rained but after I skated with Adam Jon and Jereme from 4 til' 10 at night. I have to babysit tomorrow, from 11 am til' 9 pm :X... I'm talking to Cassandra, my girlfriend of going on two months, and her friend connected with a fly... they locked eyes, he told it to fly away, and it did... but really, what else would it have done? He's probably a stoner... it sounds like a stoner type-thing. Nothing big today...

      normal school day, but after I went to Jereme's and built a three set to go along with the box we made, it's 2' tall, about three feet long and it has a ramp that folds off, a rail on top, and a three set [that's freshly built] and stuff. I was throwing wood around [at Jon... I cut his face with a piece] and some landed on Jereme's neighbor's [an old Chinese Guy's] lawn, and he flipped out so fucking much.... on only me, "if there's any wood on my lawn again I'm going to shove it down your throat!" ...so I of course told him that it was funny he had said that and laughed in his face :). Jon, Jereme, and myself left a HUGE mess on his yard so his dad flipped out too... we cleaned it up and left though. We didn't clean up the backroom, which we flooded with the house trying to fill the hottub, or the living room which had food and wrappers all over it too... I have to babysit ALL Saturday, from 11am til' 9pm ...fuck :/ ...later.

      Summer school... you know? after I skated for an hour or so, and then began construction of a fun box/mini-quarter pipe at my friend Jereme's house. It's only two feet high... and there's a ramp on it with hinges, so it folds up... tomorrow [if I'm not lazy] will be time to make the mini-quarter pipe, I'm babysitting right now... and theres a three person&nbsp;4 through 7 year old battle going on in my house.... so I'll update next time anything happens. Later.

      Apparently... my face is a chew toy, or at least that's what Molly thinks. Summer school was normal, hand in homework... learn something new, quiz on the old, more homework. On the bus ride home, I was throwing objects [batteries, pens, pencils, quarters, etc.] out of the window, and I, along with some other kid got caught and had to stay on the bus, and sweep up the whole bus and clean it out and shit... fun :). Besides that... it's been a normal day, I had band practice for a few hours but got picked up at about 6... I still have to do homework... but that'll come out of my sleeping time, duh. If anything happens, I'll update. Later.

      Today was great but ended with shit, I'll start with Friday. I did in the end, get to sleep at Richie's and saw Cassandra for 5 minutes when there, I slept there [bringing us to Saturday]. We woke up at 9 and were out to the skatepark at 10, we stopped by Cassandra's house on the way, and I saw her for about an hour. After Cassandra's we got to the park and skated there for a while, I was mainly focusing on the 1'6" box and the rails, and I learned a new trick, a fakie-backside flip. I had plenty of time to practice it because Richie fucking ditched me for two hours. I was so pissed off I would have punched him in the face, but he said he would, and did get me a pack the next day. We got a ride to my house and slept here. (Sunday) Jon came over at 10 and we [Jon, Richie and I] went to the new skatepark, one word, IT SUCKED... yeah it's two words... buuut. When I got back to my house Janette, Eric and Mike were in my pool, it was weird. We met Cassandra and Darlene up at St John's church, and hung out there for a while, it was all going good with Cassandra at that point. We all went to my house, and hung out and ate EVERYTHING. My house, is food-free, but everyone got along well, so it was cool. We ate: Two large pizzas, waffles, sausages, popcorn, crouton things, poptarts... everything; the more I think about it, the hungrier I get :). Jarred came over too, we walked to convenient and Cassandra and Mike [my bestfriend] were hanging all over eachother, holding hands hugging or having their arms around one another... we went back to my house to get our boards and go to the mall. On the way to the mall, Janette, Eric and Jarred [Jarred just followed them and didn't even know them, he's so stupid sometimes] went ahead, and the rest of us got a call saying that everyone's rides were on their way, so they went to the mall, not known to them that we weren't going. At my house I was pissed at Cassandra and wouldn't tell her why so I just ignored her for a while, I kissed her by though, but she didn't get any tongue. Everyone left at 8, but Janette, Eric and Jon stopped by at 9, and Jay and Eric left, Jon's still here and it's 9 30 on a school night... my parents are going to yell at me because of it. I'll talk later... fat kids rides still not here, so I'm going to wait for it with him. Later.

      Sorry... I've been neglecting you. First off, I'll start with yesterday, it was fun. I rode Alison's bus to her house and hung out with her Emily and Crystal for a while, Crystal bought me some more smokes :). I skated to Sherman's house because he wanted to skate, but wasn't there [ya fuggin' asshole!] and then went to Morgan's for a while, but left so she could shower and I could go skate with Jarred. We skated to the corner store, and saw Tessa... [my ex-bestfriend] it's so fucking depressing to see her, because we used to be bestfriends and I used to be completely head-over heels for her... :/. I could barely stand being there, but for some reason I wanted to stay. I played three games of skate yesterday, and won all of them... tricks included were: kickflip, heelflip, kickflip over a gutter, fakieflip, varial-flip, 360 nollie shovit, nollie big spin, some gaps, and other stuff... normal game, you know? Jarred and I hung out at Ali and Emily's house for a while, and Emily, Adam, Alison, Jarred, Tessa, Adam [different one], and Justin and myself were there, it was fun but it could've been better... Jarred's kingpin [if you don't skate, don't ask] broke off of his front truck [Venture trucks] and he had to ride a bike to my house. And now, back to the present, today: I had school off but it was a waste of time anyways, Jarred slept over and left an hour after we woke up because my dad made me cut and weedwack the front and back lawn, then sort literally 1000's [at least two thousand] of nails and screws and shit, I'm trying to sleep over Richie's so I can see Cassandra! I miss her so much :/ I can't get a hold of Richie... but I have to go do more chores [move 200+ pieces of firewood inside... GAY], love, me :). Later.  P.S. Fuck you for throwing me off that roof... you know who you are :)

      Monday's always suck, right? I woke up and felt really bad, looked around for food for half an hour, and ended up cooking and eating 6 strips of bacon [not half-pieces, full pieces] and running to the bus stop and smoking two ciggs, my lucky from my old pack, and my new pack I just opened then. Nicotine + Bacon overdose + bumpy bus ride = imminent bad feelings :/, luckily, I didn't puke. It's Alison and Emily's birthday today, [they're my beautiful twin friends] so Happy Birthday you two :). I'm starving, so I'm going to go eat my steak dinner [ :D ] and cut the lawn after [ :( ]. Later.

      I babysat all day yesterday, and only got $60 from it... but whatever. Anyways, a pack is already gone... and I got them yesterday. I skated most of the day, and had to go to the mall to meet Mike's mom, and Jereme was walking so slow, he skated downhill and was still insanely slow for the slope we were on. But he was walking, and going too slow, and we [Jon, Mike and I] told him to start skating or we'd leave, so we gave him a minute and left him on a main road, four streets from his house. Somehow he manages to get jumped by one person and get his board [which he's head for a whopping two days] stolen from him. Mike's mom ended up not meeting us up there in the end anyways... so it was a huge waste of time. Jon Mike and I went to my house after, and played some crappy looking samurai game on XBox for a while, but it ended up being good...  nothing else happened today, besides nothing. Later.
