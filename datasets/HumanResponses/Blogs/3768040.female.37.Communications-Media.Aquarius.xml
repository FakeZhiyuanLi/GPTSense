       "Current is strong from what I've heard. I'tll whisk you down the stream but I never seem to have the time so my toes just touch the water, my toes just touch the water.  Daydreammed on thr bank again, I was swimming with the fish and I thought this time it may be true so, my toes just touch the water, my toes just touch the water, my toes just touch the water.  Walked a mile just to find the edge some place low enough to step right in. Now I'm here and I can't begin to move.."  Norah Jones  Ciao my Lovelies!  Welcome to the Diva's Beauty Cafe.

The table is spread, come dine on today's feast. Bon Appetite!  It's a HOT Sunday afternoon in June and the "Lou" abuzz with entertainment and excitement about the city. Jazz festivals, Simon and Garfunkle reunions an extended run of Meet Me In St. Louis at the Muny Opera, Celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the World's Fair in St. Louis. But here in my office at the Diva's Dollhouse, there's a different kind of buzz going on. We're all working on some upcoming events for the summer. We've got some great ideas but just can't seem to pull it all together. That's the kind of work I do..Create concepts for entertainment, special events or small business. With a small team of close and like minded friends we come up with all kinds of ways for people to entertain and enjoy themselves. It's something I've wanted to do like, forever. Being a Special Event planner is a life long dream and I get to live it every day. with a pad of paper and a pen, there isn't anyplace my imagination won't take me. But that's the beauty of it. I'm not limited I can go as far as my imagination and my dreams will carry me. Sometimes, it's a short trip. I just don't have it in me do make the magic happen. But on most days my thoughts are like rain, and the ideas are the downpour. And when it's right, I sell these ideas as special events and productions. But speaking of dreams,let me ask you a question. Are you     living your dreams? Or maybe I should be asking Have you  stopped believing in your dreams? Can you still hear the faint call of a distant dream beckoning? Is there something deep within you that just knows there has to be more to life than....this? (whatever THIS is).  Like the lyrics above suggest The current in the streams of life are strong and they can whisk you away; and never really taking any risk or chances you don't dive in, you just let your toes touch the water. And like me for so long, I sat on the bank daydreaming,thinking I was swimming with the fish or walking along looking for the right place to step right in, now that I've found it, I can't seem to move. I thought I had so much to say, (living to do)but now, given the opportunty, "my toes just touch the water" What say you? "In any moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.? Theodore Roosevelt Keep in mind; "ream as if you'll live forever..live as if you'll die today." James Dean-- "Dreams are renewable. No matter what our age or condition, there are still untapped possibilitieswithin us and new beauty waiting to be born." Dale E. Turner--  "There will always be dreams grander or humbler than your own, but there will never be a dream exactly like your own...for you are unique and more wondrous than you know!" Linda Staten  Let me hear from you. What are your dreams? Can you share them? Do you walk to find the edge low enough to just step right in? Or have you found yourself still daydreaming on the bank again, and let your toes just touch the water? Hmmmmm, something tasty to chew on. Till next time,  The Diva has spoken
