      See I knew it would be hard to keep it up every day.  I really have been busy though!  Let's see...baseball Saturday and Monday. My youngest son had his last game in his minor league. He will move up to MAJOR league in the Fall where the boys pitch harder and faster. He is a pitcher now as opposed to a catcher and he is so much happier. He does really well and enjoys it. Then my older son played his last game Monday night. They played 13 games and won one. That was their last regular season game.  Then my dryer finally bit the dust so my DH got a new one last night that matches the washer we got last year. Man does it make a difference! I spent the whole day yesterday cleaning the garage to make way for the new one.  Then last night we took a party over to my grandmother's house for her 80th birthday! I can hardly believe that she is 80. I lived with her quite a bit growing up and it is really hard to watch her grow old. She has had a lot of health problems lately and it is harder for her to get around. She also seems to be losing her memory functions somewhat and she is afraid she is getting Alzheimers.  But we had a great night eating and celebrating so that is good.  Anyway....off to do some stuff.  :)

      My baby is the most beautiful baby in the world. It's true! One look at her and it is obvious. But she is a handful! She has about a fifteen minute limit on time spent in any type of constraint. Exersaucer 15, carrier 15, high chair 15, etc. She either wants to be held or be put on the floor where she can freely explore and pick up loose change, marbles, small bits of paper and legos. She has fully developed what someone called the cheerio pinch with her forefinger and thumb. So now she is able to fetch the smallest item and deftly aim it toward her mouth. I usually watch her like a hawk and catch anything she sneaks in but I did find a piece of paper in her ummm...diaper remains one day. She is not really crawling yet but she can sure move. I am afraid that the pack and play will have to come downstairs soon to contain her. Have you ever noticed that toys hold little appeal to an infant as opposed to smallish dangerous items? My baby likes to play with the strangest things. I gave her a toilet supply line (clean of course) and she spent more time with that than any of her toys! Maybe all toys look alike? We as parents choose the cute bright (expensive) toys that WE like and they take one lick and throw them on the floor.  Kenzie now is the proud host of TWO teeth. They have popped through in less than two weeks after all that time teething! Nothing gives her greater joy than biting my finger with her little sharp teeth.  Aren't babies neat?    mary

      It is late but I wanted to try to stick with making a new post each day.  My son had a game tonight and it was a great game. He pitched very well and only gave up one run. The problem is that we lost. :( But the bigger problem is that my husband fell into the role of coach dad. He was picking out the things my son didn't do instead of what he did. I think I will have to remind my DH that it really is just a game and the bigger lesson is good sportsmanship and trying your best.  I was thinking about that little boy who was all over the news because the jerk man got the foul ball and wouldn't let the kid have it. The kid is like 4 and has no clue what has been happening. He was on GMA and couldn't even sit up on the couch. It was apparent that he didn't know what the cameras were and that millions of people were looking at him. (or maybe he didnt care) Anyway, the guy was a jerk. He should have given the kid the ball. BUT, the kid had no interest in the ball. His mother flipped out and started hitting the guy with her cardboard. (It was very hot that day) I think the guy has given in and said he will give the kid the ball now. All that for a foul ball from the TEXAS RANGERS for pete's sake! It's not like it was Red Sox/Yankees World Series or anything! He is a jerk and the mom was a typical mom and the kid is just another goofy preschooler who probably didn't watch one second of the game.  Have you ever been to a game with a 4 year old? They act like they have a whole MOUND of ants in their pants!   Nuff said Time to go to bed    mary

        One of the things I despise in life is laundry!     I have 6 kids and a husband so my laundry pile just grows and grows. I do laundry like a mad woman and get the pile down way far and then I say "whew, I can slack off a bit now" and the next trip out to the garage is like BAM! This huge mountain of dirty laundry! The funny thing is that I am in this group that is supposed to help you get control of your house and chores and all that. I have been in it for years,,,,it hasn't done much! I guess I am just so worn down that when I have a free 15 minutes all I want to do is sit down and zone out!  My youngest child is the most precious 8 month old in the world. BUT she won't nap for more than 15 minutes without me beside her. This severely limits what I can do. She wants to be held or be crawling on the floor. Well, kind of crawling....more like the army training slide.  Anyway, Life is kind of tight right now as far as time.  My boys are playing baseball day and night, my daughter is in a training camp at the military base for her JROTC unit, and then my 5 and 3 year olds are on a constant mission to destroy my house.  Back to the laundry....what is the deal with being able to fold it but not put it away? I have these piles everywhere! Piles on my dresser, piles on my chest, piles on the kitchen table, piles on all the kid's dressers. I had the bright idea to use the dining room table as a folding area since we rarely use it. Do you know how many piles you can fit onto a 5 foot oval dining table? A LOT! So I scrapped that idea. Right now I have two piles on the sofa in this room and instead of putting them away I came over to check the voicemail and then decided to check my email. That's how my life runs. One distraction after another!   Well, the demons just walked in and they look suspicious so I better run. Yesterday they threw toilet paper wads onto the mirror in the bathroom. Fun.     mary
