      So here it is, my Blog!.. Thanks to Ray for introducing me to this, hopefully now I'll be able to streamline my BBOSA which I know has been very few and far between lately!.. I haven't got much time at the moment to add stuff but WATCH THIS SPACE!!!..

      So last week Pauline and I decided to take Paige out for a girl's night out for her birthday.. Originally it was going to be a dinner at the  urlLink Rooftop Gardens  in Kensington (very posh - owned by Richard Branson) but when Kris (a girl I met here through other friends who actually lived in Innisfail for a bit and went to Good Counsel as well!) found out that there was a speed dating night being held there, we couldn't think of a more fitting theme for a girl's night out!!..   so off we went charged up on a few mojito's from bar cuba, we ascended to the idyllic gardens 7 floors up from the busy Kensington High St.. amazingly beautiful setting!.. Kath and I sat out for most of it, just taking in the hilarity and weird social setting of the speed dating!!.. funny funny night..

      So.. the big news of the week is that I have decided to move in with Blake.. *gasp*!.. since my other flatties Pauline and Sam are wanting to find a better/cheaper place, and since a bigger room has become available at Blake's pub ( urlLink The Prince of Wales ), I've taken this opportunity to fulfill my lifelong dream of having a pub as my lounge room!!.. and of course to spend more time with my nearest and dearest boy!... ahhhh...

      So here I am.. sitting at my desk at work in London.. I've just checked on my blog page to see if anyone has commented in my absence and I've just realised that the photo I posted there as an example of a Menorcan beach is actually the beach we went to yesterday before flying back to this urbanised habitation.. Cala Mitjana, I think the most beautiful of beaches we visited (though with so many and my head still clouded with brilliant sunshine and crystal turquoise clear waters it is hard to judge).. Only 16 hours ago I was jumping off that rock ledge and swimming in the caves shown in the photo in the previous post.. Oh how the memory is so fresh but oh so far away....

        Only 3 days until Blake, Ray, Macca and I take off to the paradise that is Menorca... a week of lying on the beach in the glorious sunshine.. I've just checked out the  urlLink weather report .. Oh I can't wait!!..
