      Commencement is, by definition, a ceremony at which academic degrees or diplomas are conferred. Basically commencement means a start or a beginning. We live in a continuum of starts and ends. Likewise, breakup and new love are on the same line, probably in an alternate order. Breakup implies that new love is imminent. Unfortunately, sometimes it might be possible that new love is not in short order.   Do we live in a world of continuum and perpetuity?

      It seems hard to be a grown-up or a decent man. The criteria for grown-up are not evident. A few days ago I read a defintion for a man from one of the books I read when I am in my bathroom.     ...The Convent Men's Group defines a man as one who has converted experience into wisdom and who willingly acts from and shares that achieved wisdom...     ...Perhaps we have become men when we think it is important to be soft than to be hard...     These two sentences are not new and not even any close to profound. But they move my heart---They tell me something I have not recognized.

      I watched a movie on TV days ago. During summer a school movie channel doesn't run any new movie. They just rerun some movies selected from a pool of movies that have previously runned, mostly from the spring semester.   This is from one of  The American Pie  sequels (I am not sure which one this is from)  It was fun for me but it might be a stupid way of making fun for others. My recollection brings back a rough story below.     A daughter and her boyfriend were having an affair in her room. Her mom asked her dad to go up and get the two down for supper. Dad went up. The moment dad was about to say something, he heard her daughter. She was like "I'm coming!" So dad got back downstairs without asking them to come down.     You are supposed to laugh outloud at this point.

      It's like I've just bought a new diary. It feels great and suddenly my life seems to be better organized. Technically speaking, I just got this blog and nothing else happened. Sometimes I think we are not rational enough, all the time we pretend to be so, though. One simple evidence is that weather influences the way we feel. Do we need to be always rational? I used to say yes to this question. Now I doubt if I would return the same answer. I don't think that being rational doesn't always make us more like a human being.   I hope this blog could be a good place for me. I intend to keep this place rather private. Of course, 'private' doesn't mean to get you guys out of here.
