      Nothing much tonight.  Not a very eventful day.  But, since I am the world's biggest nerd, I am more then happy to post something to keep you occupied.   urlLink This man  is a genius.  Everything he does is great.  This is why I love Kill Bill.  Not that I'm saying any of his other movies suck.  (Kill Bill knocked Pulp Fiction out of my no. 1 spot.)  It is my personal belief that everyone should see the two Kill Bill movies, to make them complete.    So, some treaties for those of you who have seen it-quizzes:  urlLink For the ladies...   urlLink For the know-it-alls...   urlLink Anyone who has seen the second movie...   Yeah, I know.  I should have better things going on with my time (school work, weight loss, ending world hunger...) but I don't.  There are very few things I'm this passionate about.  Sad that one of them is this movie.  Hey, Karen, thanks...I love you :)

      Good evening, all!  Saturday has come and gone, and with no fireworks.  Well, almost none, anyway.  I had to work with her today for the first time since Sunday.  I have to say, that I must have the patience of the Buddha, because I actually spoke to her.  The hardest thing about being around her is...um...well, I guess the hardest part about being around her is   being around her.  It is so uncomfortable to be in the same room with her.  The weirdest part is I'm her boss.  So I can't just not talk to her.  I have to give her direction.  And naturally, she's a damn bum.  I always have to tell her to get back to work.  Thankfully, she won't be there tomorrow like expected.    "Now if any of you sons of bitches have anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!!!" O-ren Ishii, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  There was still one can of worms left open.  I had to address the nosy-busybodies at the skate center.  Naturally, I was appreciative of the fact those people cared enough about my feelings to tell me what was going on.  However, I do not want it to be the subject of their dinner table discussions.  So, I gathered the group together tonight while I was there.  I told them thanks, but its over, stop talking about it.  I asked if anyone if there was anything they wanted to know, if they had any questions, and no one did.    So, I believe its over.  Joel and I are good, she knows I'm pissed, everyone had instructed to get out my biznass.  Maybe my next post will be about something fun.  Maybe.  But, for now, I have to go wake my dear boyfriend up off the couch, and get him to come to bed.  Quite the chore.  Nite, all.

      So, here we are.  It's Friday, almost one whole week.  Everything is actually very good between Joel and I.  He and I have talked, and talked, and talked about it all, and we're through it.  Things are all on the up and up with us.  "Its mercy, compassion and forgiveness I lack, not rationality." -The Bride, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  With Lauren, on the other hand, things are not so splendid.  She has realized that she made herself look like a total ho, and now she wants everyone to feel sorry for her.  And since no one but me usually feels sorry for her whenever she screws up, she comes to ME for pity. ME!!  Yeah, I thought the same thing. She called me today, and told me she's quitting the skate center, because she doesn't want everyone in her business.  And she wanted advice on where to look for a job. WHAT IS SHE THINKING? For all of you out there thinking, "That Celeste is better then I am, I'd have beat the hell out of that girl."  Rest assured, I wanted to.  But legalities and my conscience would not allow me to hurt her.  (I ended up just taking it out on the 14 year old boys in my Taekwondo class.)  However, being a cheaty ho is not her only vice, she has been doing some other bad stuff, and her mom just so happened to find out about it at the same time as she found out about the thing with Joel.  Needless to say, moms is pissed.  I guess "everything comes full circle" for everyone.  ;)  Enough about that-in some strange sequence of events, Columbus managed to wrangle Blues Traveler into coming to Riverfest this year.  Riverfest was so tiny this year, you could spit from one end of it to the other, but we got Blues Traveler.  Haven't really been a fan of their recent stuff, but I have always wanted to see them live.  They played all the favorites.  (Hook, Runaround, But Anyway)  They also played some not-quite-so-favorites.  (can't name any of these, they're not my favorites.)  And they played a quite stirring rendition of "Devil went down to Georgia."  It was great.  Besides the fact that there was an overwhelming smell of grilled sausage and Chattahoochee.  Taking a cue from Karen, (or, really, ripping Karen off...Apparently I do it well, how do you think I got this stunning personality:) Its the Friday Five!  I have picked one from the archives.  Its from March 12.  1. What was the last song you heard? (I'm not thrilled about this) Perfect, by Simple Plan.  2. What were the last two movies you saw? Kill Bill Vol. 2, and Houseguest.  3. What were the last three things you purchased?  The Kill Bill Vol. 1 DVD, a gyro at Riverfest, and a Berry Clear Sprite.  4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Find some new car insurance, practice my forms and one steps for Taekwondo, clean my hamster's cage, call my mom.  5. Who are the last five people you talked to? Joel, Bryan,(that's the cute country one, Karen) Christi, Nick, and some girl at the Tap who asked me if I was from the Philippines.  Well, that's it for tonight.  I'm going to watch some cartoons and hit the hay.

      "Revenge is never a straight line." -Hattori Hanzo, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  Welcome to my blog.  Recent events have made me decide that I need a method for getting things off my chest.  And, like in most of the rest of my life, my friend for the longest time, (not my "oldest" friend) Karen, has inspired me to start a blog.  So, back to that revenge issue.  About four years ago, I journeyed down the path of sketch.  I had only been with Joel for 2 years at that point, and I cheated.  I don't know if we hit the 2 year mark, and I freaked out having never had a relationship last longer then 2 months or what.  But I did it, and I was not proud.  I didn't tell him, because it was a mistake, and it didn't really mean anything.  I had a lot of sleepless nights, I can tell you that much.  Well, I got mine.  I found out Sunday that Joel had been cheating on me with a friend of mine.  A 17 year old friend of mine.  He and Lauren had been seeing each other for about a month or so.    Through a various sequence of events I got this info, while I was at work with her.  I told her that I knew, and I walked out of the room.  "That's great.  I don't care." -The Bride to Vernita Green, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  When I came back in the room, she proceeded to tell me that she was sorry.  And how it had just been eating her up inside that she was doing this to me.  Then she had the nerver to tell me that "everything comes full circle" and implied that this was my fault for cheating first.  By the end of the day, I convinced myself that I wasn't mad at her anymore.  I believe I did that just so I could get through the rest of the day without stabbing her.    He apologized profusely.  Begged for my forgiveness.  Profusely.  I made him explain it all to me.  I came to the conclusion that I believed his explanation that it was a huge mistake, and it didn't mean anything to him.  Understandable.  I'd been in the same situation.  When I was still feverishly pissed, I told him that I cheated, because I wanted him to be as mad as I was.  It worked.  We have forgiven each other.  Everything is good between him and I.  "You and I have unfinished business."  -The Bride, Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  Since I convinced myself I wasn't mad at her, and I really was, I had some stuff to tell her.  So I called her, and I told her that she was no longer aloud to speak to him.  At all.  And if I found out that they were talking, that's it.  It for me and Joel, It for me and her, and probably it for her and Joel too, because I'm becoming a finely tuned ass-kicking machine in Taekwondo.  I delivered the same instructions to him as well.  I believe that Joel is good.  He won't try to keep a friendship with her.  Her on the other hand, I do not trust her any further that I can pick her little butt up and throw her.  Because in addition to fooling around with Joel behind my back, she was sleeping with a guy from school behind Joel's back.  Slut.  Well, there you have it.  My very first post on my very first blog.  Incase you were wondering about the url, the title and the quotes...I have an obsession with Kill Bill.  Before Uma kills anyone in the movie, she reminds them that they have "unfinished business."  And if by chance, you have been in a hole and you have missed the movie, Hattori Hanzo is a character in the movie  (based on a character from old samurai shows) that makes swords.  That's where "cutyoulikeahanzo" comes from.    Well, it is time for laundry and hair straightening.  More later.  Peace.

      Hello all!  Sorry for the long vacation I took.  Between the end of the semester business and what not, I've been a busy girl.  I've also been a tired girl.  Honing myself into an ass-kicking machine at Taekwondo is wearing poor lil' ol' me out.    But anywho, things between Joel and me have never been better.  We've worked out all the problems and such, so we like each other again.  The 24th birthday is approaching.  I'm okay with that.  Birthdays don't really mean much between 21 and 30, do they?  I'm not very excited about it.  I like it when people five me stuff, so I guess I can manage to get a little excited about it, but not much.  I usually know what everyone is getting me, so I get sad because there are no surprises...but like I said, I'll be a little excited.  Alright, I know, boring post.  But hey, I'm a boring gal.  More later!

      Hello, hello...    I am telling you guys!  Love is a pain in the ass.  The little bitch child had been trying to make me kill her this week.  Joel has been talking to her again.  She makes him feel guilty (because she's a nut case and he's gullible) about telling her to bugger off.  Well, she psychoed it up Sunday night, and as a result, Joel is on the couch.  I never thought I'd be one of those "couch=doghouse" girls, but it gets the point across so well.  He and I will be alright.  Love isn't supposed to be easy anyway, right?    In regards to my search for a girlfriend for my roomate: amazingly enough, he met someone.  Not who I would expect, but he met her no less, on his own.  She's nice enough, and cute, so hopefully it will work out.  Please, for the love of God, let it work out.    I believe I am going to make a trip to Atlanta to see 5SI on Friday.  I will be going alone.  Ordinarily, I would never do such a thing, being such a chickenshit and all.  But, its at Turner Field before a Braves Game.  So I'll be parked in a well lit lot.  They need support at their shows-the kind that knows the words to their songs-so they feel like the rock stars that they are.    until next time:)

      Well.  Another day, another dollar, right?  I know now, why I went 24 years without cutting grass.  My father has a broken leg, so he can't do yard work.  It took me 3 hours (with Joel's help, even!) to cut his back yard, and I have to freaking go back and cut the front on Tuesday.  I am SO going to be rich enough to pay a yard service to come cut my shit when I own a house.    I went to this new bar in town tonight called The Draft.  Its an alright place, except the music's a hair too loud for conversation.  The place was very clean, and very big, which are two things I have come to appreciate about night time places.      Well then!  I'm out.   Peace homies.

      Well, hello there!  I'm just fine, thanks!  I had a very eventful night tonight at work.  Can I just say, that the older I get, the more I hate teenagers.  I'm serious.  I've been working at the skate center since 1996, and they just get shittier and shittier every year.   Now, there are some exceptions.  I know this girl named Joan who is 17, and is wise beyond her years.  Joan has a great head on her shoulders, and she doesn't ACT 17.  Most other teenagers blow, though.  Tonight I broke up a fight between a 15 year old boy and a 17 year old boy.  My TKD training is paying off, because I snatched those boys up like they were a couple of puppies fighting over a cheeto.  But they were fighting over garbage.  One of them called the other one of them a bitch in front of a girl or some nonsense like that.  Silliness.  SO, myself and another employee of mine broke the fight up, only to realize no one else was out there with us, and that we had to wade throught the rabble that had encircled us. ("FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!!")  I find out that my adult coworker was just hanging out in the office, and the DJ-or "the bitch" as I like to call her(see first blog post for more info on the bitch)- was chilling out, eating her dinner away from the lights and music controls, which would have been helpful to bust up the crowd.  I  was irritated, because in breaking up said fight, I took a punch to the arm.  I was also irritated because they made me run, and they made me sweat.  SO I snatched the kid up and took him to the office, and went to find the DJbitch to tell her to get back to the DJ booth.  I yelled at her.  I did not mean to, I was flustered and frustrated, so I let her have it, but then I tried to apologize, and she wasn't having it.  She just stomped out the door, and didn't bother to ask me (her boss) if it was okay to leave.  This is why I hate teenagers.  Because if they're not doing dumb shit like fighting over something stupid, they're being disrespectful assholes to their bosses and coworkers.  I need a new job.    ON a lighter note.  I have a new passion* in this world.  It is a band called  urlLink Five Star Iris .  For anyone who has ever been part of the Atlanta/Columbus local music scene, you may remember them as Another Man Down.  This band is truly awesome.  It has been a while since I've been passionate about a band.  The last one was the Dave Matthews Band-until one too many extasy popping teenagers (damned teenagers!!) ruined my Dave experiences.  Anywho...the guys of 5SI are some hard working guys.  They are constantly on the road, because they are trying to make it.  I have made it my personal mission to get the word out about them in Columbus, and I've even bugged the hell out of Rock 103 to get them on the air.  (Which is looking futile, but radio in Columbus is a whole other diatribe.  I'll have to put that in a separate post.)  They've opened for Collective Soul, and Fuel.  They have a Fuel-y-ish sound, except they rock just a bit harder.  They play some originals, which are well written, and catchy.  Its like they're the cover band in my brain.  They played American Girl, (Tom Petty) One, (U2) I Want You to Want Me, (Cheap Trick) and Blister in the Sun, (Violent Femmes) during the second set at the  Loft last Saturday.  I can't say enough about them really.  For anyone who's curious, you can truck on over to the site, which has mp3's.      Nitey nite or good morning!   *and this is not because I think Rob, the bassist is cute .

      Hey folks! There's not too much new in my world. Oh yeah, Joel and I decided not to take a break. Even though the marriage issue isn't resolved...we've decided we like being happy together way more then we'd like being lonely apart. I'm sure eventually he'll really need one, but until then, I guess he's stuck with me.     The new mission I have in life is finding my roomate (who is also Joel's brother, for those of you who don't know.) Eric is a terribly nice guy who has trouble meeting girls you would want to stick around. I've put his picture on several personals websites, and sneakily diverted those girls here to this website, so that they can learn a little more about him.     Eric is handsome and driven. He works as a claims auditor at AFLAC. He's been in college, taking his time (like me) for almost 6 years now. He's a business finance major. He's supernice, he just has issues with the wrong kind of girl being attracted to him. He's very responsible, but likes to have a good time. I have known Eric for 7 years now. I have been dating his younger brother, Joel, for 6 of those seven. Despite recent problems, Joel and I are doing well, and think Eric needs to go out on dates. He had his heart broken about 4 years ago by his first love, and has been uncapable of finding decent female friends ever since. Help a brotha out! Give Eric a Holla! You can email Eric at jledge@knology.net I hope this information is useful. ;)    I'll keep you all posted on the search!

      Hey everyone!  Its Friday!  Well, actually, now its Saturday.  But all the same-still crap.  I had a very serious talk with Joel-and forced him to tell me what the hang up is.  He's "not sure" if "I'm" the "girl" he wants to "marry." (The quotation marks make it sound fun, you think?)  And then he told me not to "take it personally."  How on earth I wasn't supposed to take that personally is totally beyond me.  I know right now, and have for quite some time, (without a doubt) who I want to marry. So why on earth doesn't he?  Of course, its silly of me to apply what I know about relationships and life to everyone else, but I figured that he and I had been on the same page for so long now, this is one of those things we could get together on.  So its looking like I'm gonna be living alone, (with the exception of my baby boy, Beau) within the next month or so.  I suppose I don't really have to. I guess I could move back in with Dad, or move in with one of my friends.  But I've never lived alone, I don't even know if I know how.  I'll look at this as a challenge.  And I'll face it the same way I face every unwanted challenge.  With a nap.  Adios.

       I'm BAAACK!   Wow!  Do I ever apologize for that long break.  I have been worn out, and stressed out and freaked out since May!  I should give you the quick update.  After a few more incidents, (including one where I cussed the child out)the "Lauren situation" is over with.  I had to practically lose sanity directly on her head, but I did it.  I had to threaten to call the cops, threaten to beat her ass and talk to her mother about controlling her, but it is all over with.  I made a B and a C in my 2 Maymester classes.  The B I am proud of because I didn't study, the C I am expecially proud of because I didn't even buy the book for that class.   Now, the event that is on the horizon is my moving out and living on my own.  Joel has thrown out the idea of taking a break.  What kind of break, you ask...I don't know.  He wants a break, but he doesn't want a break up.  He doesn't want to date anyone else, but he just wants to do his own thing for a while.  I pack up my stuff, and he unpacks it.  I tell him I'm looking at apartments, and he gets all upset.  He says he didn't think things all the way through before he said something to me. You know, I just don't understand, either.  If it weren't for my job and school and life in general, I would just pack it all up and go keep Karen company in Statesboro after Mike leaves.  Joel is absolutely driving me nuts.  Well, that's the quick update.  I promise, promise, promise I'll be a little better about keeping this thing up.

      Here I am! No, I wasn't hiding, I just had a very eventful weekend. On Friday, I did not manage to make it to the Braves game like planned. I did, however, drive to Midtown(ish) in Atlanta to see the guys (of Five Star Iris) at the Black Bear Tavern. I was singing their praises before, but I'd only heard them electric--which can have the tendency to mask any imperfections (if there are any.) But I finally got the hear them acoustic, and it was twice as great as an electric show. I got to meet Alan's wife, who is the world's nicest person, and all their great friends/fans from Atlanta. Not to mention the place was totally cool. If ever in the 1900 block of Peachtree Rd NE in Atlanta, I highly suggest stopping by. The food is great, the bartenders are quick and its virtually idiot free. I hate Columbus.  Speaking of things I hate. I gave my notice at the skate center on Saturday night. I came to this heavy realization Friday as I was making the drive between Atlanta and Newnan: I'm an adult. Sure, I was the manager of the skate center, but I had to work until 11 or 12 on Friday and/or Saturday night. Working at the skate center was causing me to miss out on things like dropping everything and driving to Atlanta to see 5SI. Atlanta is so close. If it weren't for my huge environmentally unfriendly gas guzzling vehicle, I'd go every weekend. And I just can't do that if I'm bossing around 17 year olds who complain about everything until 11 pm on Friday and Saturday. I'm tired of working 6-7 days a week. I want to be able to have 2 days off like the rest of the working world. So I shall. Bitches.  Well, off to bed. I need some sleep as I have started my diet today, and eating right makes me pissy. I need to make sure I sleep as much as possible so I don't have that working to make me pissier. Plus I have to go to work at 12 tomorrow for some stupid ass luncheon to thank us for all our hard work. Its appreciated-definately-anything to keep me from working. But my job is much like the movie "Office Space." Except we don't have to take our cubicles apart, they're falling apart on their own.  Peace homies!
