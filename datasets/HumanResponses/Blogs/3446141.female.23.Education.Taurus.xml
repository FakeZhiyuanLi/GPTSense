      Ok I have decided that the reason for the crazy dreams is because I'm keeping my parents dog and she wakes me up in the morning around 5 or 6 and then I go back to bed and have crazy dreams.  The one from tonight, not as morbid!!  I was lost in LR?!?  I was driving home from my parents and I took the wrong exit and got lost in the straight up ghetto, but some nice hookers helped my find my way home......lol.  Very wierd.  Cindy (the dog) leaves today!!  I will finally get a full nights sleep without having to get up to let her out! YAY.

      Ok so first of all keeping my parents dog is driving me CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!  Everyday at almost exactly 6:15 am she wakes me up because she needs to go out!  Well I need my sleep.  Anyway, I get up and take her outside, she pees, I bring her back in--all the while dealing with spazdog Bentley jumping all over me--then I crawl back in bed, shutting both dogs out of my room, because Cindy is awake now and doesn't want to go back to sleep.  I fall back asleep and have some of the craziest dreams of my life!!  I actually dreamed that I was decapitated!! How weird is that.  I was still alive in the dream tho, I just no longer had a head.  The head was lying on the table, but I could see it.  It was very strange.  In the dream I had someone call 911 for me but the ambulance never came.  Then I woke up because I heard something buzzing in my ear, which freaked me out, because if you know me then you know that I have a phobia of bugs crawling in my ears.  So I got up, then went back to bed and had another crazy dream but I don't remember it.  I wake up about 30 minutes late, and rush around getting ready and leave my house only about 10 minutes late for work.  I had fixed myself a little Chi Latte for breakfast and was drinking it in the car...........well 1/2 way to work I spill all but a 1/3 of it on me and the seat and the cup holder!! I was NOT pleased.  I called work informed them that I would be very late seeing as how I now needed to change cloths and clean up my car. Finally get to work 45 minutes late.....shitass!!  But it's ok, everyone is fine with it and I will make it up on Wed.  I'll work til 6 or something.  Anyway for lunch I take my car to get the oil changed and then some coworkers and I hit the mall for the big sales!  I end up with the crazy sales lady who follows me around finding things for me to try on, and asking me every 2 seconds if I'm finding everything ok or if I need a different size in something.  So to repay her for her annoyingness, I leave a big mess of cloths for her to put away in the dressing room and only buy flip-flops! LOL.  I know, I'm just creating bad Karma for myself, oh well.  Well we get back to the Mazda dealership to pick up my car; I go in and ask the service guy if it's ready yet.  He says he doesn't know and he will go check on it for me.  Comes back and says it will be another 20 minutes.  I'm like crap.  We are already late for work as it is.  So I say ok, well I'll just come back after work and get it then.  Then he says well I'll give it to you for free since it is an inconvience to you!! I was like Hell YEAH!  I'm brokeass poor anyway.  So I'm very excited to save $30!! :)  I hope he remembers when I go to get it.  So that is my day as of yet!  It's been a busy day! LOL. ttyl

      Well this weekend was the infamous Family Reunion....dun dun dun.........I survived it!  Well it started out with my mom freakin out because I was about 10 minutes late meeting them at their house in Sherwood, but I got there and we left.  The ride up was very nice, I got to read some of my book that I started last month and just hadn't had time to read.  But of course that meant that since I was reading my parents HAD to pester me, and ask questions about the book and whatnot.  Anyway approx. 2 hours later we arrive in the very large town of Evening Shade, I believe it has a total of about 300 people at the most, and that is probably including farm animals. LOL, needless to say we were in Nowhere, AR.  The weather was wonderful!  Nice and cool, actually a little too cool for me I had to put on a jacket lat that afternoon.  This was the day: -Arrive approx. 10:30am -Hug Family members, "how have you been, good, and how are you?" -Play cards with my younger cousins -Get asked by the younger cousin (14) if I have a boyfriend, and do I plan to stay single for the rest of my life---talk about a depressing thought!  I was like, "well I'm not trying purposely to stay single!"  I didn't think it would be right to scream I'm a whore to my little cousin...lol......no. -Go out side visit with aunts, uncles, and cousins -Participate in the Horseshoe tournament (we are serious about some horseshoes...there were plaques for the winners!! LOL) -I lost at horseshoes on the first round (I suck at it!!) -Visited with my cousins new wife (the cousin that is my age) -Ate BLTS for lunch -Visited, watched horseshoe tournament -Napped for like 3 hours!!! And omg was it nice. -Woke up around 5:30 -The best ribs in the world for dinner at 7 -Finally left at 8:45!  At this point I'm in a bit of a rush to get home, because Alicia and I were goin to go out to celebrate her birthday.  Ended up at Disco, got home at like 3 am.  Went to bed to get up at 9:00am to go to family reunion again.  Day two -Horseshoe tournament continued........Dad left with a gold plaque for the Men's competition, and Mom with a silver for the Women's......however no plaque was won by them in the Couples competition. -Visited some more, etc.  Ate more food...etc. -Left for home around 6:30  So that was my weekend.  Now I am dog sitting my parent’s dog while they are in Branson, MO.  It has been fun to see how Bentley (Tyler’s dog) and Cindy (my dog) get along. Cindy literally weighs like 5lbs.  She is all skin and bones and she doesn't like Bentley to follow her around the house....and she will snarl and snap at Bentley and make her run away.  It's funny because Bentley is so much bigger than her.  Anyway, I've written enough for now.  ttyl!

      Well this upcoming weekend is my mom's side of the family's Annual Family Reunion, or in other words the "Why isn't Laine married yet or at least in a serious relationship?" weekend of fun.  So I have several options...lol.....  Option number A: Come with a prepared list of all the reasons why I am apparently undateable/unmarriable.....This might actually be fun to make up it would go something like this: Not cute enough Too cute Too fat Too skinny Too smart Not smart enough Too Shy Talks too much Do you see a trend here?? lol.  Option number B: When I reach the point of frustration after being asked by over half the family (we have a big family by the way---my mom has 6 brothers and sisters, and they all have kids, and their kids have kids....and so on.) if I have a boyfriend, I will scream "NO because I am a Lesbian!"  That will shut them up.  And I will be the talk of the reunion; I always enjoy being the center of attention. ;)  Option number C: And I do believe this is my favorite.  Same situation as above, however I instead scream, "No I don't have a serious boyfriend, because I am a whore! Got that, a WHORE! One boy cannot satisfy me, I need more!  And all the guys I've screwed are too possessive and I had to dump them." ;)  So those are my three options.  Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they really are great, but shit they just don't leave the whole relationship or lack there of alone.  And it does get very annoying.  I've thought about just bringing a guy friend to "pose" as a boyfriend, lol, too bad my parents are there and they would know.  I'm hoping to get out of going to the reunion on Sunday :)!  Because it's Alicia’s Birthday and we may celebrate it on Saturday.  We will see.

      Well just to update, since I haven't posted since last Thursday.  I didn't go to the doctor after all....lol, as soon as I made the stupid appointment my throat started felling MUCH better.  It's funny how that happens.  Well this weekend was kinda nice.  I didn't really do anything big, but it was just kinda relaxing...........altho I will not lie I am wanting to go out sooooooooooooooooon....lol.......but it will be at least another weekend before that happens, because next weekend is the o'so much fun annual FAMILY REUION!!  Anyway back to what I did this weekend, I was getting ahead of myself.    Ok so this past weekend, well for starters I was trying to get some people to go out on Friday, but no one wanted to really, soooooooooo since I realized it was my brothers birthday party the next day and I still didn't have a gift, I went shopping.  I ended up buying the 3rd season of Sex and the City for myself.  Well I didn't actually buy it; I had a gift certificate for Best Buy.  Anyway, while at Best Buy I realized I should just make my brother a cd, so I bought some cases.  And also decided to get him some books, he LOVES to read.  So I went to Barnes and noble and got some books.  Finally, got home around 7 or 7:30 and started working on his cd.  This took a long while.  And had I gone out I wouldn't have had it done, so it was good I stayed at home.  Also, Alicia was home too and was packing for Florida and I helped her pick out which outfits to take with her.  While doing all this at some point the water gets shut off.  We realize this when the washing machine won't work, and then none of the faucets work either.  So of course I'm like SHIT!  What am I suppose to do.  And Alicia is all calm (which is easier for her because she was leaving in just a few hours for Florida and wouldn't really have to worry about it).  I was worried about not having a shower for the next day.  So anyway nothing can really be done at 12am soooooooooooo I just used bottled water to wash my face and brush my teeth. Saturday morning, I wake up around 11 and first thing I do is go check the water, and nope it's still not on, and my brother’s birthday party is at 2 in Sherwood.  EEK.  I go get my phone to call my parents and let them know I'm coming over to shower and I see that I have a new text message from my friend Andrew.......who is in DC right now.  He was having a good ol' time with the vodka...lol.  So I call him first and talk for a while then call my parents.  It ends up taking me over an hour to get to my parents house, so by the time I get there I only have about 45 minutes to get ready.  Anyway, I end up meeting them at the bowling alley...lol.  After that I went to a movie, Around the World in 80 Days.  It was cute.  And in the middle of the movie Tyler called to let me know the water was back on.  Some how a valve in the house had gotten bumped and it shut the water off.  BLAH.  I was happy tho because I didn't have to stay the night at my parent’s house. Sunday, Father's Day, pretty much the same as usual.  Church, lunch with the fam, and then home.  Ummmmm, didn't really do much of anything.  I went to see The Stedford Wives that night, and I like it.  It was pretty funny.  So that was my weekend.  Not much too it.   This is a training week so...........I won't be posting all that much.  Unless I think about it when I am at home.  Later!

      Well I have something wrong with my throat.  It started feeling funny on Sunday and Monday, it felt like I had a hair or something stuck in my throat.  Which is a very, very irritating feeling.  Anyway, I finally looked in my throat on Monday night, and it was gross.  I had little white spots on my tonsils.  I figured gargling Listerine would make them go away, because it usually does.  So I did that, then on Tuesday, I woke up and my throat still felt weird. I gargled more, and then looked at it that night before I went to bed and lo and behold I now not only had white spots on my tonsils but a gross whitish film had formed right around my uvula.  So this started to freak me out and on Wednesday morning I began looking at a lot of medical sites searching for something that looked like what I had, and it got narrowed down to Tonsillitis or Strep Throat.  So yay.  Either way I need to see a doctor.  Because if it's strep then I need to get some medication and if it's Tonsillitis then I need the same, because it's affecting my breathing and speaking abilities, which will make my next training week HELL (22 people by the way).  So anyway you may be thinking so what's the problem, just make an appointment.  Well I don't have any health insurance!  I just can't afford to pay someone else an extra $100 a month when I don't get sick that often.  So I am probably going to end up spending about twice that when I pay for the appointment and antibiotics.  Oh well.  I made the appointment for tomorrow morning at 8:15.  I actually hope that it's strep just so it will make the appointment worthwhile.....lol.  That would REALLY suck if the Dr. just told me it was an everyday sore throat and to go home and gargle salt water.  Oh well we will see.

      I don't understand why it must be 30 below where I work!!!  What the hell, I mean what the artic! OH OH OH OH I forgot that I have a little space heater under my desk. YAY! Warmth.  Finally.  Ok feeling good. So I have big big news.  I will be traveling to Athens, GA on July 15-18, so if anyone would like to come with please do because I will be all alone.  Why am I going to Athens, GA you might ask?  Well I hope you are sitting down for this, I am going to.......drum roll........BALLOONAVERSITY!!!  How sweet is that.  Yeah ok so it's really kinda lame, but hey it's a free paid vacation in my book.  However it sucks that I have to go it alone.  I have some family in Georgia, but it's about 2 hours away from where I will be, and I won't have a car.......so I may not get to see them.   I have a family reunion next weekend too, and I'm not really lookin forward to it.  It's pretty much just a 2 day food fest.  Seriously we get together and eat and talk that is all.  This weekend is my lil' bros B-day!  He will be the big 21....woo woo.  It's gonna be a bowling party.  So I will get to show off my "skills"........lol.  If you've ever been bowling with me then you know I suck at it.  But it's fun.  Ok well back to work.  ttyl

      Why is it that I can work at the largest candy franchise and still not be able to get my favorite candy!!  I want some gummy bears! Or gummy worms would be fine as well.  As long as it's gummy.  Oh well, I am instead forced to eat some "extreme bursts" to satisfy my craving instead.  But it's just not the same.   Well this weekend wasn't much to write home about.  lol.  Friday night was a girl’s night.  Saturday I actually got up and went to the store and bought some storage items for my room, very helpful and productive!  Then I made a detour to Pier One.....big mistake..LOL!  I bought inscents, a inscent holder, a candle, and three small vases.  Where any of those things on my list of things to buy?  NO.  Oh well.  Then that night I just chilled at the house and went to bed early.  Sunday, went to church, then I lazed around some more that afternoon.  Then at about 7ish I went to a movie with my friend Lacey and her boyfriend and his roommate.  Went to see Saved.  I liked it a lot.  Then when I got back I had this amazing spent of energy!!  And I cleaned the hell out of my room.  And it looks amazing!  My closet is so organized.  But I still have to get some crap to hold all my t-shirts and winter cloths.  So that is the mission for this afternoon. OH and on another note:  Victoria's Secret is having their Semi-Annual sell!  Started today.  I went at lunch. AND: Sex and the City starts on TBS on Tuesday.  However I'm not that sure on how good it will be considering they will have to cut a lot......hummmm we will see.

      Ok so Comcast had a planned on coming to hookup our cable at the house between the hours of 2 and 5pm......sounds easy right?  Well apparently not.  5 rolls around, still no cable.  So Tyler makes a phone call and they say "oh right, uhhhh, he will be there by 5:30 sorry for the inconvenience."  So I get home from work around 5:00, hang around waiting for the cable guy........yet again a no show at 5:30.  So Tyler makes another phone call and the cable people say "oh erm, well he will be there by 6:45.  So anyway at this point my friend Beth has already come by the house and is hanging out will I get ready for us to go out for a girls night.  We finally decided our plans, dinner then Willy D's (if there wasn't a cover) and left at 7ish.  Still no cable guy at this point.  We leave Tyler there to fend for himself with the cable situation.  Well finally around 8:15 I get a call on my cell phone, Tyler needing to get Alicia’s password to make sure the internet is working on her computer.  LOL.  Talk about late service.  Anyway, I just think that there should be some way for the Cable Company to be just a little bit more organized!  That is all.

      Yay! Training is over! Finally!  They have all gone home.......don't get me wrong they are all nice people, it just gets tiring having to take care of them all week.  And I really feel like just taking a long ass nap right now.  But I can't because I am at work.  OH and YAY for cable and Internet now at home!!!  FINALLY!  lol, it really is sad how dependent we become on our computers and other gadgets for that matter.  My computer is one of my forms of communication; I really would be going crazy if I couldn't get online at work.  I don't know how Alicia and Tyler did it.  Anyway I am very excited that it is Friday!  This means I get to sleep in tomorrow morning and I just can't wait.  CAN'T WAIT.  I have missed my sleep.  In fact the other night, I was apparently missing it A LOT because after I got back from dinner with Tyler and Brett, I decided to just lay down in my room for a few minutes.  You know just rest my eyes.  Well I passed straight out!  I woke up at 3:00am still in my cloths, make-up on and all the lights on as well!  So I got up out of bed, washed my face, put my pjs on, turned off the lights and got back in to bed and slept for another 3 hours till I had to be up at 6:30.  Anyhow so I am looking forward to more sleep this weekend, and getting some things done on my room.  Ok that is all for today.

      Well our house is slowly being Martiefied!!!  Very exciting.  I have decided I just love Martie, she has made our house look AMAZING!  I wish that I had more time to help out.  But I can't wait to have every thing settled, so that we can have ourselves a little house warming party!! :)  Everyone is invited.  Right now the living room is almost done, we still have one chair to move in.  The Dining room is shaping up, and so is the kitchen.  It is all very exciting.  Every time I come home or wake up in the morning I look forward to seeing all that is done!!  Or what new thing was moved.  What is not exciting is that it's a training week!! BLAH, and we are so freakin behind it's not even funny!!  Like for real a day behind!! EEK.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get everyone all caught up.  Anyway so that is a little stressful.  That and trying to get everything that I need for my room.  It's still a mess.  And I've been going to bed around 1 every night, because I've been out shopping, cleaning the old house (in c-town), or organizing my own room.  Well that and I rented Sex and the City and have been watching that because we don't have cable yet and the 2 channels we have right now are fuzzy.  So anyway I keep busy...LOL.   We get Internet on FRIDAY!!!!! I can't wait.  Okay well that's all for now.  Ttyl

      So it is Monday yet again.  Well at least I had a descent weekend. On Friday, I decided I would start my fun early and I made myself a little drink.  Come to find out wasn't as little as I had once thought.  Oops....lol.  Anyhow, after this Tyler and I decided to go to Home Depot for switch covers, showerheads, shelving, storage crap, etc.  And I was made to drive, he didn't know about the "little" drink.  I wasn't drunk, just buzzed.  So that made Home Depot sooooo much more fun....lol.  During this time my friend Carrie had called to say that she and the boys were going to be grilling and I should come over.  So I did....lol.  Only the thing is as soon as I got there everyone else seemed to leave... :(  But I found out it was because some other people were coming over and no one liked them.  I hung out for a little while longer, until I got a call from my roomie Alicia who said we should go out to Cowboy, so I said hell ya, better than just chillin here.  So by 11:30 we were on our way......barely there for the 75 cent drinks (I got dropped off at the door!!) So anyway we danced the night away (we were meeting other people there so it wasn't just us girls).  For real. We left about 4:30ish I think!!  Alicia had run into a guy she knew from school and we were talking to him.  He was there with some other guys, they are all in a band together, I don't know the name, but they played at Juanita's on Sat. night.  Anyway my point in that was that we all decided to go to I-Hop for some food after cowboy.  So I wasn't at home and in bed till about 6:30am!! DAMN! I felt bad for Alicia because she had to be at work at 10!! eek!  But she was the one that drove that night, so it was her choice as to when we left.  But it was lots of fun.    So on to my happenings for Saturday.  There really isn't a whole lot to tell on Saturday.  I slept till about 2:30 pm...got my 8 hours!!   Then I lazed around the house for a while.  Talked to my mom for a bit....argued is a better word I suppose.  Those who know me know the subject matter and all that it involves so I won't bore them with the details, but if you need a reminder think.. Wild River Country Church Service.  Once that was over with, I lazed around some more, cleaned a little bit, tried to organize all my shit from moving but didn't have any luck.  Just kept finding myself taking little naps....lol.  Alicia got home and we chatted then she fell into a deep coma like sleep around 7!  LOL...We had planned on going to see Ben's Band play (the guy from the night before, well that morning.) at Juanita's.  The show was supposed to start at 9:30 pm. So I just did some stuff around the house/got ready to go.  Around 9:00 I go and "wake" Alicia up.....this means I just came into the room as asked if she still wanted to go because it was 9:00.  She says and I quote "yeah, I just trying to wake up, it takes me a while, and I know my eyes are closed but I'm waking up."  LOL.  I said ok.  Well we need to leave soon, so then she goes on to tell me that the next band (that we were also going to see) probably wouldn't start till like 10:30 or 11:00 and we could just get there for that.  Lol, I was like um ok, you’re just going to sleep.  So I called a few friends to see what was going on, and finally decided just to rent a movie.  But before I did, my good friend LaDonna calls to tell me that she is going to the Electric Cowboy to ride the Bull!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Which was oh so funny.  She stayed on for a recorded breaking 1.2 seconds.  Anyho, so my night ended with me eating an ice cream sandwich and watching the first 6 episodes of Sex and the City (second season)....The cable still isn't up!!  This Friday!  Can't wait.  Now Sunday I was freakin productive!!  That morning, there was the infamous Wild River Country Church Service.  Then I get home only to leave again and go shopping for house/room stuff!  I spent about 250.00, and got a lot of stuff!  I got some cool bamboo drawers from Target, along with a "cart" for my bathroom, picture frame, halter dress, tank top, showerhead (so that I too can shower in the rain in my own shower!), candy, and an outlet plug thing so I would have more outlets in the bathroom.  Then I got a new full-length mirror from Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  And then I got some oh so cool beaded pullbacks from Pier One for my curtains!  Then I came home to the NEW furniture, which Tyler just got that day, and to Marti, who is helping us fix the house up!! YAY.  So I put all my furniture pieces together and organized my room some more and found my way to the bed around 1 am.  eek.  Monday, today, is training.  BLAH.  No horrible training stories as of yet, however I can foresee them coming.  This isn't going to be a very good group, but maybe I am wrong.  One can only hope.  Okay I'm off for now.  TTYL

      I don't like my job for reasons like today.  Everything was great I was movin along getting all my shit done and then I get hit with some other project that I'm suppose to get finished by the end of the day on a Friday no less!  I was told about it sort of.....but I was told that I would be making ONE that is 1 gift basket with some gourmet coffees.  Ok that's cool I can do that.  But no come to find out that isn't what I'm doing.  I had to make up some random gift baskets for freakin George Foremen....No Kidding....the one and only George, who has like 50 billion kids named George as well.  That one. Didn't meet Georgey just the middleman.  But I had to put together baskets with coffee mugs/thermos, coffees, BBQ sauce, marinade, and other meat seasonings............oh um WTF, that stuff doesn't go together.  But whatever.  And they wanted not ONE not TWO, but THREE baskets.  And by the way they brought the shit to me at like 2:30 and were like can you have them done today??  What the hell?!?  So that put me in a shittyass mood. But I got it done by 4 because I am fucking amazing.  LOL.  Anyho.  The guy came back to "look them over" he didn't have a lot of faith in me I don't think.  But he freakin loved the baskets I made.  It was kinda funny, and it helped my mood.  So I am feeling better now, than I was when I started.  And very glad that I will not be at work till 7:00 on a Friday.  BLAH and next week is a training week, oh yes, I can't freakin wait!!!!  Sarcasm is my friend. Later gaters!  Everyone have an awesome weekend!! Call me if anything fun is goin on!  Or if you are too drunk to drive home to C-town and need a place to crash in LR. LOL

      I am so glad that it is Friday because that means I get to finally sleep in on Saturday!!  What are my weekend plans you may ask?  Well to tell you the truth I'm not all that sure.  Tonight is up in the air, nothing "planned" so who knows.  Saturday however gets complicated.  I have two friends that want to hang out.  I would have us all do stuff together, but mixing different kinds of friends sometimes isn't the best idea.  But no mater what on Saturday I am SHOPING!!!  That is fuh show.  I have about 1/2 the amount of closet storage now in the new house and well that means I am going to either have to store some cloths away in storage bins that I don't have...OR buy a chest of drawers for all my extra t-shirts and winter cloths to go in.  But the later is more pricey and a bigger decision.  So Rubbermaid here I come!! :)  Ok so I won't be online, more than likely, any this weekend because we still don't have cable in the house for the Internet hookup.  So I will try to leave another message this afternoon. Later.

      UGH! So it's only Thursday.  Blah.  I am so freakin ready for it to be this weekend, not that I have plans yet.  I should probably get on that, because it would suck ass to be stuck at home with no cable and no Internet.  Well I did start a new book, so I guess I could read, but I'd rather go out!  I don't have much to write about at the moment, but I wanted to waste some time so here I am.  I am goin to Tech Electric in Maumelle today to pick out a new fan for my room!! I can't wait!  So I guess that will be my purchase for this week, next week will have to be a rug!  My bed is on wheels so every time I even slightly touch it the bed goes sailing across the room!  So I need something to stabilize it.  LOL.  I have so much stuff to buy for the new house...eek!! I think I'm gonna need a second job!  Any suggestions?  Ok well I am off to do some real work now, hee hee not really!  I probably just gonna look at stuff online.

      Ok so I have decided this, Fast Food is the DEVIL.  Why is it that everyday at lunch I end up rushed and have to stop at some junk food place?  I hate it. Today's fast food choice Chick-fil-a. BLAH. And why is it that it can taste so good and make me feel disgusting at the same time.  This is why I have come this realization!!  No more!  Has anyone seen that documentary that was made about fast food?  I haven't seen it, I don't know if it's out yet or not, but I read about it on the MSN home page a couple of days ago.  And needless to say it was shocking.  I mean we all know that "yeah if you eat fast food all the freakin time your gonna gain weight", but it was horrifying all the shit it does to you body along with that.  I mean not that any of this was a shock; I've been told it all before.  And I obviously continued to eat my fast food.  But what they did in the documentary is have the filmmaker eat fast food and only fast food for like a month or something, and if he was asked if he wanted to super size he has to say yes!  I'm talkin breakfast, lunch and dinner!!! Anyway here is a quote from the article:  "When he began his McDonald’s binge, he weighed 185 pounds. He ballooned to 210 pounds by the end. His cholesterol rose by 60 points."  Isn't that gross!  So I am putting an end to fast food eating..........well not an "end" I will still have the occasional burger but by occasional I mean like once a month! LOL!  But fuh reals, Who is with me??  PS: I love Alltel!!  They are AWESOME!

      Ok so I still don't have hot water at my new home....UGH!  So this morning I got up around 6:50 so I could leave and shower at a friend’s house.  And let me tell you it was the BEST shower ever!  He had this cool showerhead so it was like I was showering in the rain.  Oh I liked it a lot!  Can't wait to go back tomorrow, yes tomorrow and possibly Friday. We called on Tuesday to get the gas turned on, but they said it would be Friday before it would be on.  Also still no cable or Internet, sooooooo makes for a lovely night of unpacking, but it's ok because I have vodka and grapefruit soda now!! LOL. Oh that reminds me.  Yesterday was my grandma's 78th birthday!!  Happy Birthday Grandma.  She is in town and so I went out to my parents’ house in the Wood to celebrate last night.  My dad grilled since we didn't on Memorial Day because I was all movin and shit.  But anyway my Grandma is funny because she is deaf in one ear, and I always forget which one and end up having a conversation with the wrong ear...lol.  Anyhow for her present I got her a little picture frame thing that would match her bedroom AND because she loves cheap alcohol........I bought her a 4-pack of fuzzy navel wine coolers.  She was very excited and got a kick out of it.  She gets silly drunk off of like 2, and it is very fun to watch.  So I provided entertainment for us all by giving her the wine coolers. Hee hee. Ok well back to me.  I am at work Hella early today!!  I know it's hard to believe, but I got to work around 8:20!!  For those who don't know I'm usually not here till like 9:20.  So yay for gettin some extra time in!  Ok well I am off for now; I must get my morning caffeine before I have absolutely no focus what so ever.  Bye for now.

      Ok so I have been convinced by my good friend Beth that I too should create a blog just like everyone else.....so here I am, creating one....Thanks Beth (www.nurseslife.blogspot.com).  Little plug for Betheroo.  I decided that of course I need one more way to waste time at work!!  Because apparently aim, okayamigo, online shopping, random online searches, and just plain chatting with the other girls at work just isn't enough for me anymore.  Don't you have work to do you might ask...and the answer is why yes I do.  However it is very easy and I have to make it seem like it is hard for me so I don't get given anymore.  LOL.  No really tho, I do work hard.  It's just that on my "off" weeks I am less stressed and usually feel that I deserve a break, so I play.  Oh, and for those who don't already know I'm a trainer for a franchising company, I won't name any names.. ;), and I teach training classes every other week usually.  So an "off" week just means I'm not teaching the el stupidos that week.  I however should have very funny posts up on the training weeks, because this will be where I vent all my frustrations and tell the world the stupid stuff that happens to me.  I know everyone is very excited now.  Ok so this will be a short post because number a. I don't have that much to say yet and letter b. the computer erased the first draft I had!!!  BLAH.  So I had to quickly make a new, considering my lunch break is over and has been for about 15 min. Oh well.  I'll probably post again later this afternoon.  ttyl.

       I just don't get why some people have sooooooooo much trouble understanding things or thinking on their own for that matter.&nbsp; I swear I feel like I have to explain and re-explain to the point of insanity.&nbsp; Here is an example of what I deal with (from adults mind you).&nbsp; If I were teaching a training class on how to wipe&nbsp;your ass these&nbsp;are the reactions I would get.&nbsp; Some would "get it" first try (love them), others will need some explaining.......so I explain how to properly wipe an ass..."they get it"&nbsp;and just start doing it....maybe they need some help with "technique" but other than that they get it, THEN I have the ones that I will explain how to wipe their ass to them, they just sit there with a confused look on their face....so I will explain again, give visuals to help, go into great detail on what to do--such as how to position the toliet paper properly on your had so as not to get messy.....they ask some questions and then "pretend" to "get it."&nbsp; I walk off to help others with their technique.&nbsp; The "pretenders" try to wipe their ass and just end up smearing shit everywhere.....at first I feel bad (*thinks I must have not done a good job explaining*) so I go over and help...even demonstrate by wiping my own ass in front of them and then have them do it (not to me that would be weird....and none of this is real just an example--just incase you were getting confused.&nbsp;LOL).&nbsp; They do it correctly, but then the next time they need to wipe their ass they can't do it and need it explained AGAIN, at this point I have decided that they are just dumb-shits, but it's my job so I explain again.&nbsp; Then they will continue to ask me the same exact questions over and over----or better yet they will ask me "opinion" questions like what kind of toilet paper do I have to use??&nbsp; (WTF!! I think.)&nbsp; I respond with "whatever kind you choose...I personally like...cottonale, but it's up to you."&nbsp; Or I would get questions like "When do I wipe my ass??"&nbsp; I would respond with "when you have shit on it" *thinking dumbass!*&nbsp;    This is just an example of what I deal with during training weeks.......I DO NOT train people to wipe their asses.........I train them to make&nbsp;bouquets.&nbsp; But the stupidity I get sometimes is equal to that of what I have just described.&nbsp; So if you ever wonder why I get easily frustrated that is why......my patients is tried every week I have a training class.&nbsp; So to all my very smart friends, I love you and appreciate your patients with ME.&nbsp; Ok that is all for now......I've been busy and haven't had time to write.

      Ok so I'm supposed to be packing, but I am taking a break.  I've got all my clothes and whatnot packed but now I'm on to all the crap that I need to get ready with so I really can't pack any of that till tomorrow morning after I get ready.  Pray that I wake up on time!!!!!!!!!  My flight isn't until 9:50 am, but I'm gonna have to leave around 8ish to make sure I can get through any security checks that I might have to go through.  Anyway, I'm taking a laptop with me so hopefully I will be able to get on it while I'm there and keep in touch.  I will keep everyone updated as to what is going on with Balloonapoloza.  Hee hee.  Oh yes it's gonna be a blast!  Actually I'm really close to the mall, so that is promising! Depending on what time they close.  Ok well I'm gonna get back to packing.  Or maybe I will just play around on the internet for a little while longer.......hummmmmmmmm.

      WTH!  Why is it that the people working on the road don't feel the need to put up signs anymore??  I was on the way to work today and just about died....ok not really.  But, I was driving along, right behind someone else and then all of a sudden they switch lanes and I look in front of me and omg! there are cones lots of orange cones.  So I slam on my breaks as this man is walking towards my car and waving me into the other lane......I'm like no shit dude....thanks for the freakin sign letting me know before I come over a hill that my lane is going to end...thanks.  Not a good way to begin the day needless to say.  Things are a little better now......although I would like some caffeine; right now I am sipping on a sprite.  Ah well, everyone have a wonderful day, and what out cus you lane might end suddenly.

Is the green too harsh?  I don't know why I ask, it doesn't matter too much the green will be stayin for a few weeks at least.  K!  Nite everyone! ;p

      Well this weekend was pretty casual, didn't really go out or anything.  Friday night some friends were grillin and such but I wasn't really in the mood to drive to NLR so I stayed home with my sickly rommie...lol.  Anyway, I found myself at the local BlockBuster lookin for a good movie.  I ended up getting Gothika and Girl with a Pearl Earring.  They were both good!  Gothika was way freakier than I thought it would be!  That was what I watched on Friday night, then after that I went to a movie at the theaters with my other roomie Alicia.  We went to see the much acclaimed movie "The Anchorman" and it was very funny!  And crowded considering it was the opening weekend, I think.  So that was Friday, didn't go to bed till like 3 tho because I ended up staying up and reading a book. LOL, I'm becoming a grandma, lol.  Then Saturday I slept till like 12:30 and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!  I love to sleep, even tho I always feel like lose some of my day, I don't care.  Then I got up cleaned, ate lunch, and got ready to go.  About the time I got outta the shower every one got home.......lol......Alicia home from work and Tyler home from wherever.  So that slowed me down, but I got out of the house around 4!  Tanned and visited the greatest store EVER!!! LOL.  Drug Emporium! OMG!  They have every kind of hair product known to man!  I mean seriously I was in heaven!!  I spent about $50.  Oh well.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Then I just went shoppin with Alicia, RK and the Mall.  And bought my 6th pair of flip-flops this season!! Isn't that crazy!  Ok that was my boring weekend.  For all to read. It's Sunday today.  And I think I will do my nails!  Perhaps I will have something more interesting to talk about later.

      You know it's really weird how time works, when you're little it seems like FOREVER for a year to pass, and once you get a little older they fly by.  I probably wouldn't notice it that much but, I've now been at a job I don't like for over a year (it really was only suppose to be temporary) and another training week has passed.  At the end of each training week I add a class photo to my notebook so I can keep track of who is who and when they came to training.  It is VERY helpful.  After 24 training classes it tend to forget who everyone is.  And wow 24 is a lot.  I just counted them, I didn't realize I had done that many, no wonder I have become numb to it.  Numb to the monotony of each week.  And it's already July meaning the summer is almost 1/2 way over as well.  It's a weird feeling thinking about how much time has passed and I haven't accomplished that much.  Hummmmm, I don't really like this feeling so I'm going to change the subject.  It's Friday and yet again I am left without plans!  Stupid LR, I move here and no one wants to go out anymore!  Oh well.  I'm trying to see if I can make some plans with my friend Carrie, I haven't hung out with her in a long while so I'd like to visit with her.  And my roommate is sick with tonsillitis and a spider bit...eek.  My other roommate is bogged down with a summer Bio class (BLAH), and will probably be working tonight.  Hummm......so not really sure of plans, although I truthfully would be fine with just hangin out at home watching a movie.  I don't know I'm just in one of those moods you know.  Which means I probably DON'T need to be staying at home, because then that will be all I want to do......it get into little funks sometimes, and the only way to get out of them is to be around other people, but once I am in one I don't want to.  It's a horrible cycle.  LOL.  Ok well I'm going to try and do some work........hahaha, no I’m not!! I'm going to talk on aim and probably shop for shoes online!! MUHAHAHAHAHA

      Well this week was supposed to be an easy training class.  I only have 3, count um, THREE people.  YES-just 3.  That is all.  So anyhow, I get to work on Monday in record time, mostly because I work at probably the only company that was open on the 5th.  Oh well, no biggie, until I get to work and have an email from my boss, that says that she will be staying at the lake another day (well she has to because "people" are there--Bullshit) I wouldn't care, in fact I would be happy she wasn't coming in any other day than the first day of training.  Because she is suppose to come in and do all the introductions, tell the company story, and her story.......the franchisees really get a kick out of it.  My boss is a wonderful motivational speaker (even though not everything she says is true--if you don't know her, you believe it) and her speaking to them on the first day just jump-starts the week.  Anyway so I was pissed not only because she wasn't coming but also because I didn't find out till that Monday.......so there I am caught off guard, and unprepared!  It was not fun.  I really don't like to be unorganized during the training classes!  Anyho we make it through the day, they seem fine (the trainees) a little dull, but fine.  And I went home, tanned, and passed out on the sofa for an hour....lol. Well this weekend was fun, Saturday I slept in :), then got up around 11, lazed around...I watched the Ashlee Simpson show---LOL, why is that crap addictive!?!?  Anyway around 1ish my parents call to see if I want to go see Shriek 2!! Which I have really been wanting to go see, so I got ready and left.  However, in the process of me getting ready and getting out there they change their minds and decide to see Spiderman 2. Which I didn't really care if I saw or not.  It was ok, pretty much the same basic story as the first one.  And Tobey made some really ugo faces (shouldn't spiderman be cuter???).  Then I headed home, didn't really do anything that night.  Sunday--The 4th!--started out about the same, I went to church with my family, and then we came home and had barbeque chicken (YUM) with all the fixins.  Then around 2:30pm (after an hour nap, lol) I left and headed for home, the Iwent to the grocery store, and spent MORE money!!  EEK!  I shouldn't need groceries for like 2 months now!!  Then that night I hung out with my friends Matt and Beth and some of Beth's family.  It was fun.  Got home around 12:45, because I made a stop at taco hell, then went to bed after gaining about 10lbs from all the food I had on the forth!!! LOL.  Ok that is all for now.  Tuesday seems to be going well....hummmmm.....but we will see.

      Ok so I love Chinese food!!  I went out to lunch to day with me mum and we decided to go to Chi's which I like a lot.  The only thing I don't like is how I'm always hungry like 2 hours later!! What's up with that?  I'm already thinking about dinner and its only 3:45pm!! Oh well.   Today has been really nice, mostly because I had the day off from work!! Yippee!  But last night I went to see Dream Girls at the Rep and it was VERY good!! I liked it a lot, I even got sung to during it......for real.  There is apart in the play where one of the characters is singing in a "club" and he picks a person from the audience to sing to, granted I just happen to be third row outside seat.........so it was an easy pick!! It's not like I was in the balcony and go sung too....LOL.  Still it was fun.  Then I went out that night to Cajun's which was also fun.....came home, and then around 3am my drunk friend Andrew decided to come over.  Well actually he's been sick and so the medication probably made it seem like he was worse off than he really was, but anyway he was back from DC and came over to see the new house.  Then FINALLY I went to bed after he left.....then I got to sleep in which I LOVE TO DO.  And today I have just been lazy and went out with my mom for lunch and coffee at Barnes and Noble and now I am home again.  Ahhhh it has been a nice day, except for all the rain........Did I some how end up in the rainforest???  I think it has rained everyday for the past week!!  Oh well, I guess we need the rain or we will in a month or so when I stops raining, better soak it up now trees!! Ok it's time for me to lazy around the house some more!  Ttyl

      This probably the funniest movie I have seen all year..........so far at least. I was seriously laughing through the entire thing!! It was 80's fabulous!! I kinda want to go back to the theater and see it again, so if anyone hasn't seen it and wants too..........I'll go! lol. I went with Alicia and her co-worker Will, and we got to use my free movie passes from the Manchurian Candidate fiasco. Watching Napoleon completely made up for that night! If you haven't heard the story about the "fiasco", just ask me and I will tell you it, it's just too long to write. Anyway, so on to the job front. I got a lead on a new job..........very exciting. So I called today after my dentist appointment (which I have to go back because I have a defective filling.......wonderful!), and omg the architect that I was calling knows my current boss. Shit shit shit. So hopefully I still have a job, with my current empolyer. I'm really not excited about that. He, the architect, said he was "friends" with my boss, not just that he knew her. I was said "oh really", I thought "mother effer! Shitass". Apparently I will have to move to another state if I want to get another job...........because my boss knows freakin everyone. Oh well, I'd like to move it wouldn't be so bad. But I will have to wait till my lease is up here in LR. hummmm, well it's around 12 pm so I think I shall go to bed now. Goodnight.

      Well yet again I have come to the end of a training week, thank God!  I made it through another week without going pyshco, at least not at work. LOL.  Anyway, the weekend looks promising, Finger Eleven is playing at Juanita's so that could be fun.  I also still have my free movie passes from the last weekend when the stupid power went out!! UGH.  I still want to know what happens at the end of the Manchurian Candidate!  BLAH, I heard it wasn't that great.  Anyway so I have those movie passes so I could go to a free movie.  :)  Then there is always the Cowboy to go to, I haven't been in over 2 months!! lol.  Oh and Nancy is having a party also.....  And I may end up just going shoping and then going to bed early, who knows.  Then Saturday has been claimed by Beth apparently.......lol.  Since Matthew darling will be out of town, she will be lonely.  GIRLS NIGHT.  Well hopefully, we shall see if there is anything to do........maybe Willy D's or something.  Who knows.  OK so I have about 20 minutes to kill, I hate friday's they can be soooooooooooooooo BORING.  Oh well.  I guess I will go play around on the web for a bit.  Later kids.

      I fucking hate every fucking thing about my fucking job. Ok I feel a little better now. I had to do something so I didn't cry. Ok so I'm a little emotionally unstable this week anyway, if you know what I mean, so that's probably the reason for the almost tears. But I mean come on........I just got hit with several things this morning that just about pushed me over the edge of reason. First, my stupid group from China freakin shows up today.......Mother Effer! I am not excited about that......this means that I get to work my ass off (for no money mind you) to get them caught up without bringing the rest of the class down. So wonderful......I'm very excited at the thought of that..fucking yippie. And then I go in and the class bitch as I have dubbed her because that is what she is, tells me she has a "village idiot" question/comment....which in bitch language means I want to insult you so please stand here and take it while I tell you that you do a bad job. She wanted to tell me that she didn't under stand that when the training schedule  sheet said "read the first 3 chapters in your ops manual" that that means the same thing as "read the first three sections" (and I had told her before she left that the homework was to read the first 3 tabs---serously I said it like 5 times!!) She got all confused because that tabs don't say chapter..........OMG use your effing brain!! Is it that hard? Has it been in storage for a long time??? This really wouldn't have been that big of a deal had it not been the same woman who has been rude the whole time she's been here. I don't know, I'm just having a bad day and needed to vent. Ok I'll probably be venting later too.........lol.
