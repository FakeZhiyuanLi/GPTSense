       Those of you reading this are already aware of my penchant and need to express my political views in a rather long and tireless form. I'll try to be succinct, but that's much like asking Todd to be "less gay."     &nbsp;   I am beginning to truly explore what I believe. As I move in to more challenging phases of my life, where my career, life and relationships begin to carry more meaning, I am forced to reconsider my values and politics. It's not easy growing up right smack on the division line of Generation X and Generation Y, having the cynicism and contempt of authority of the first while also believing in the vision and optimism&nbsp;in ideology of the other. To no surprise, the inevitable contradictions surface, the kind that your average conservative talk-show host loves to attack. In the end, I don't believe any of us can come up with a leak-proof system. Anyone that believes that they have one is normally functioning on pure ideology, a very un-human way to operate.     &nbsp;   I was reading an interview with Michael Moore in a film publication and was interested in his own critique of F'9/11. (Note: I'm not even going into the film right now.) Michael was talking about his use of humor in the movie, and how humor is one of the few ways that the "common man" can equalize his position with those who are in power. That got me to thinking about the fundamentals of democracy and the craziness of our own country vs. What the Western world is attempting to implement in Iraq.     &nbsp;   In looking at any society and change, you must look at the context of history. For this point, I turn to the French Revolution. At the time, the Americans had just completed their own little separation, and the people of France were tired of the ruling class. Their solution was to behead their leaders and form a democratic government, adopting a constitution similar to America's, with our help. The key here is that the leaders were beheaded, taken out by the aggression of their subjects, using the great equalizer (death) as the means. In our own society, we use humor. We make fun of the stupidity of Bush, the ailing Cheney, the robotic Kerry, the boy-faced Edwards and countless others that become subjects of our put-downs. It's our way of equalizing the leadership.     &nbsp;   Here's the problem: nothing happens as a result. We don't get so angry that we take action. We don't move to change. We sit there, we laugh, we feel better and we go back to listening to the top 40 station that is playing songs directed by a conglomerate of corporations that aren't touching on the topics that are on the forefront of people's minds. To most, that's such a "bummer."     &nbsp;   Because of tyranny, we have decided to invade Iraq in order to liberate the country from a dictator and installing a workable democracy in the area. A great and noble goal, one that I would love to install in all parts of the world: Saudi Arabia, North Korea, parts of Africa, etc. The need for democracy, however, could very well start here.     &nbsp;   The rates at which the people of this country participate in elections is pathetic. Much has been written on the participation of youth, blacks, and others in the political process. I wish I could credit this thought to the person who spoke it a few years back, but I believe the comment was, "at what point does political participation become so rare that you no longer live in a democracy?"     &nbsp;   Therein lies my point: the political process, the system of democracy, true democracy, is a myth. Unless you are a congressman, you or I did not vote for HR 3162 (USA PATRIOT Act), the tax cut measure, or any other bill that has been passed through congress and signed into legislation. In theory, we wouldn't have time to make informed opinions on individual bills, so we have contracted that work out to people we deem appropriate. We have a representative democracy where the popular vote doesn't even elect the president. Adding the small complications confuses the average person, who is more than willing to let you do the work for them by electing not to participate in the political process through not casting a ballot.     &nbsp;   In theory, I believe in smaller government and state's rights, a very fundamental conservative and Republican thought, simply on the basis of democracy. That's based on the thought, however, that people are willing to participate in a democracy. They are not. They want an "elected monarchy." People like the class system. It makes life much easier for us, since few of us have the maturity to stand on our own two feet in front of those who posses greater status than us. So we create a system, biased to one or two major issues in our minds (the most frustrating for both sides of the spectrum is Abortion) and pull the lever that fits with those values, caring not whether or not the person possesses the leadership, ethics, intelligence, foresight or commitment to the needs of the public. This is what we're attempting to install in Iraq?     &nbsp;   How are we to proceed from here? As a country, we have many choices, often too many. I don't care if you are a Republican or Democrat or Libertarian or a Whig, but I do care that you spend time figuring out what it means to be part of the process. We are all more than laborers, looking to make enough money to feed, house and clothe ourselves. We are all the fortunate sons and daughters of a land of opportunity, resource, and innovation. If we must proceed on a crusade that includes "democratizing" other parts of the world, then we have the explicit responsibility of doing the same at home.     &nbsp;   ABCJr.

       "It's the economy, stupid," is the genius line of James Carville used as the primary message for Clinton's campaign in 1992. It hit home with voters who had just survived a recession through the George H.W. Bush years and saw supply-side economics as a major reason for their struggles. It wasn't about Kuwait or Saddam or Desert Storm. It was about the economy.      Twelve years later, things are different. Extrapolating on Carville's line, "It's the war on terror AND the economy, stupid," at least in the minds of many voters. Unfortunately, things don't work quite like they did in 1992, and campaigning as Kerry does on the economy puts him in a dangerous position for both this election and the next.      You see, the world has changed. In 1992/1993, I was 12. I distinctly remember a magazine article talking about how things aren't made in America, how our economy had gone global. We have shoes made in China, pants made in Pakistan, and shirts made in El Salvador. I was amazed, as a 12-year old, how far the things I use in my daily life had traveled.      This trend is still in effect, but on steroids. Not only are more things being manufactured in foreign countries, but we are outsourcing service jobs as well. It's not just the shirt anymore, but maybe the software or the customer care centers. Offshoring has reached the white-collar knowledge worker.      Kerry has made this issue a fundamental part of his platform: keep jobs in America. I'm about to go out on a limb: he's wrong.      Unfortunately, the world isn't built on anecdotes of those that have been left behind by the epidemic of offshoring. People don't make purchasing decisions, at least not on the whole, based on where a call center is or where software code was written (see Wal-Mart). They buy, on the whole, based on price and quality. The world has been built on competition, on the ability for one group to produce something better/faster/cheaper than another. This means learning new skills and workers making the transition to be more competitive, not using the government to build a society that allows workers to stay stagnant as the rest of the world finds ways to do better/faster/cheaper.      Where the conservatives fail and where the liberals could succeed is a focus on job training. Yes, we recognize this pattern and have accepted it as a natural course of what's happening in our world. No, we won't spend government money to stop it because it hurts the American economy in the long term. Yes, however, we will spend the money to increase access to education so that our knowledge workers can continue to be an invaluable part of the productive world.      We're no longer in a society of closed borders and interstate commerce. We're truly in a global economy, and one position of power cannot make the necessary changes or adjustments to create either a boom or a bust economy. Therefore, either man is safe for us economically. In my opinion, though, a focus on job training and access to education is the best way to ensure America's future success. It truly is about "the brand called you," whether you're a steelworker, IT associate or CEO. Without continually learning and growing your skills, you allow yourself to become replaceable. And you wouldn't want that, would you, stupid?      ABCJr.

       You've read the title for the third time, wondering if it really says what you think it says. "Penguin Sexuality." You repeat it to yourself, contemplating what the words below it could bring. "You can't possibly be talking about penguins having sex."      This week's Pittsburgh City Paper (sporting a lovely picture of the lovable local sports talk show host Mark Madden on the cover) features old  News of the Weird  archives. The following is an exact quote, word-for-word, from the story:      "In 1996, Cambridge (England) University researcher Fiona Hunter, who studied penguins' mating habits for five years, reported that some females apparently allow male strangers to mate with them in exchange for a few nest-building stones, thus providing what Hunter believes is the first observed animal prostitution. According to Dr. Hunter, all activity was done behind the backs of the females' regular mates, and in a few instances, after the sex act, johns gave the females additional stones as sort of a tip."      You heard it right, folks. We have prostitution among the penguin community.      I wanted to alert many of you to this dangerous finding, especially in light of the many field trips young children take to zoos across the country. Of course, we must save the children from seeing this "whoreiffic" act take place, so until I see clear and measured change from the penguin community, I am demanding that parents refrain from taking their children to a zoo where the offenders could be a featured guest.      Perhaps we can get some sort of governmental agency involved, or create one that will address the problem of immoral behavior in the animal kingdom. Surely there must be some way to stop the sheer massacre that animals and insects on the lower ends of the food chain are subjected to. And once again, what about the children?      I have a person that could lead this charge... Rick Santorum (and you thought I couldn't make this political). Rick has made it his personal business to focus some of his social policies on the sex lives of roughly 28 million gay Americans, not to mention all you folks that enjoy the occasional three-way or romp with Rover. Rick understands the acts of prostitution, polygamy, and beastiality better than any other politician in the country. I suggest that Rick propose a bill that would make it illegal for penguins to prostitute themselves for nest-building stones. I would like to mention that the government will in no way help to find or pay for the nest-building stones. If the penguin is able-bodied enough to have sex for the stones then dammit, she's strong enough to work and find them for herself.      This comment may be a little off-topic, but what the hell is Dr. Fiona Hunter doing spending five years researching the mating patterns of penguins? Don't let the word "mating" fool you, it sounds nicer than the truth, which is, "penguins going at it." Imagine what the conversation between she and her parents was like, the day after she returned home from Christmas break her Freshman year of college:      Fiona's Dad: "So honey, have you picked a major?"   Fiona: "I was researching becoming a physician, but I'm just not interested in people. So I looked into becoming a veterinarian."   Fiona's Dad: "That's great honey, so what now? What will be your specialty?"   Fiona: "Well, this is what I think. I'll spend four years in undergrad, then another five years after that getting my doctorate. After that, I'll probably move down to Antarctica and study the way penguins shag each other."   Fiona's Dad: -floor-      If I'm a member of penguin community, I'm pissed. They were kind enough to let her WATCH, then she goes and tells everyone about it. I guess no one ever heard the slogan, "What goes on at the South Pole stays at the South Pole."

       The avoidance of pain, on the whole, is more of a motivator than the pursuit of happiness.      This psychological and philosophical debate has raged for years, with a majority believing that pain avoidance (read: fear) is a primary motivating factor for decisions in our lives.      How many people do you know that picked the easy road for fear of failure? How many of your friends didn't go after a woman/man they were attracted to because of fear of rejection? How many people stay in jobs they are unsatisfied with because they are scared of coming out of their comfort zone?      CNN is reporting a study that found that "fear shapes voters views." According to researchers at the University of Arizona - Tucson, those that thought about death or September 11 were more likely to lean toward Bush's policies on Iraq.      Much has been made about the barrage of comments about Kerry's service in Vietnam, but I believe there has been equal criticism (and rightly so) of Bush's use of September 11. In fact, Bush's use of September 11 has been gratuitous in many ways, highlighting his weaknesses is many other areas that are truly important to people's lives. The sad reality of the election is that he may have to use the attacks as his ticket to the White House. As a president, you can't feel very good about yourself when you've divided the nation 50-50.      The only presidents to my limited memory and civics knowledge that have had worse approval ratings in wartime going into an election were Lincoln and Bush Sr.      We are divided country without the capable leadership, from either major party, to lead us through the difficulty of the second half of this decade. That is something of which to be truly fearful.
