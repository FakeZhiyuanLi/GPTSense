      i took a stroll down memory lane on a fine saturday morning - bright and full of life at nine o'clock in the mornin'. not so hot, yet not so cold, the breeze upon you on a summer day and the only thing you must assume, is that this, will always stay.  as i walked out the door, i took a right instead of a left, and as i do, i soon deduce the peculiars of memory lane. the funny thing about memory lane was you never know what's next since the intersections keep changing, is the next marx or elaine?  on this particular morn, it seemed t'was maine so strange to realize as i looked behind me the scenary changed for it seemed obvious to see that this was not what i knew as memory lane.  for as i had walked out my door, the sight that i saw were of people who stayed, household and all and yet as i view the sight at the present position, i only see empty locations.  yet i did not turn back to run for my house for my legs refused to move in that direction it seemed that i could only go forward and i did with great reluctance.  i turned forward to see new neighbors entering dear memory lane, and as i walked past each and every one, i see them all move out their homes.  i soon decided to return home, and took a cab since i couldn't walk and soon found my house demolished along with the rest of memory lane.  does one move forward, or does one stay back? does one move out empty handed?  i did as a matter of fact move out of memory lane, for present was no more for me at memory lane.  the past is for remembrance the present for the actions, the future is for what is to be and memory lane is all three.

      It's hard to find true friends in this world. People that care, people that make you laugh even under the worst possible situations that come out to be hte best. Someone who doesn't backstab, someone who you TRUST won't don that. You'd feel lonely at times, and you've gotta talk to them, and even if they've got things to do, THEY'LL take the time to talk. They'll let you know that, hey, you're NOT ALONE.  They're also the ones that'll bring you back to your senses if you do somehting stupid no matter how much it hurts to bring that one person back to reality. On more than one occasion taht's happened to me: Stuart, who nearly had to slap me out of it when I've gone completely lovestruck on more than one occasion. colva, who lemed me realize that, hey, if something happens it happens, and there's no fit of rage that will make it go away. Adam who helped me constantly look at the reality of things. Jared who I've shared moments of arguments and philosophy. Josh who I constantly fought with who showed me that, hey, sooner of later we're gonna find that I'm going to have to see the brighter side of things. Alex who showed me how to lay back and relax. CHILL. And Will, even after years, always looked out for me.  And sooner or later, you've got to say thank-you's. I decided to say mine today.

      I really can't wait to go back. Back home! Finally. It's not that hard to find a home it seems, but being smack-dabin the middle of nowhere can be rather... tedious. Maybe it's because I'll be so far away from everybody that I can think away and not worry about anything else. Away from my problems... it's like a fantasy to go back to except it's some sort of reality. It's a place to rejuvenate again and not worry. It's home. Of course, it's painful in the fact I'll be away from friends: Alex, Adam, Stu, Andrew, Fritz, Aishling... but I'll have a chance to get over other things in life, and I'll have more freedom and a breather. Isn't that what summer break's all about. And honestly, school here can really suck. Honestly, a month and a half of summer holidays? Really! Where's the sense of getting bored!? And school starts on the 18th of August... A WEDNESDAY! What are they, nuts?  Honestly! Summer is about BOREDOM. You have plenty of time to do absolutely, positively nothing, and then you can go back to school fresh and eager. I'm at the moment supposedly on the verge of entering the hardest two-year junior-and-senior high school course in teh world. A month and a half to recuperate and get my "game plan" straightened out before I enter hell!? You've gotta be kidding me!  Ah, well, but for now, HOMEWARD BOUND, baby! BTW, I'm leaving on Thursday.

      I tried with a friend to do one last "all-nighter" via e-mail, and I have to tell you, time flies fast. But one thing we did was to know each other again, and we played Truth or Dare, rather, it was "Pick one of the two truths." The first question promptly went into our crushes, which were developed, quite recently. The friend who I talked to developed one here, even though he was overseas for the past half a year, still manged to LIKE someone HERE. It was rather ironic to me, but understandable because I've managed to like someone out of the country. Long distance relationships always seem to fail, but they're always so TEMPTING. He asked two truths that particularly made me think, so here are the justifications to what I told you, friend.  (a) Do I still like [A]?  Answer: I don't know. Honestly, I'd say I was still on the verge of recovering. I've liked [A] for quite a while now, and in consideration, her attiutdes change so much in a sense. I've aso go thte debative thing with [B] as well that it gets confusing. A little dilemma? Not really. [A] is the sort of girl taht most guys would fall for: sweet, energetic, pretty, sportive and intelligent... mind you, not to say that [B] wasn't all these things, it was more on the lines that this was more emphasized, I guess. I actually asked her out a year ago and got shot down as badly as a duck on the ground.  Most guys would tell you strongly then to GET OVER IT and MOVE ON. Well, unfortunately for me and/or her, I got stuck. I could never shake off that brilliant smile her rich laugh, or her witty remarks, however, you at times see her darker sides. And then you wonder: is it all worth trying for her, when a part of you says "yes" and the other "no?"  (b) If [B] was still at [location] would I still woo her?  Answer: Yes. I saw her recently and she was THE MOST GORGEOUS thing I had ever seen in my life. She blew my mind away! I think I completely lost my composure and seriously screwed up though. But if I had more chances than one, then yes, I'd take all those opportunities and try. Not only because of her physical self, but the fact that her PERSONALITY! My God! Sweet. So now, according to my friend R.J. Kimura, I'm one of those petty romanticists that are at every corner. lol. Pathetic, isn't it?  By the way, we never got too deep in the "Truths" due to the fact my mother decided to intervene. Sorry.

      The greatest invention in the world is one that any given person would say, "Ah, why didn't I think of that?" Some people say it's the washing machine, some people say it's the remote control, or the automobile, and others would say it's the computer. I'd say that these are all very good inventions, but to me, and at this moment, I'd say the greatest invention in the world was the pacifier. You know, those sucky things that shut babies up? Yes, well, you see, at this very moment, while my brother is having one of his temper tantrums, the only thing that allows you to get just that single moment of silence you need is the pacifier. There are a few purposes to the pacifier:  a) it sends a message: shut up. b) it sends a false message: oh look! It's food! Why don't you just shut up? c) it keeps the baby busy: it allows them to suck on something besides the remote control you want to use to see the game on T.V.  Now the irony to the situation is, after you use the pacifier yourself, it gets kind of addictive. Really.  So who said pacifiers weren't suitable for all ages?

      People always pray that THEY have the better day, but you wonder to yourself, is it worth making that person over there's life just a tad better? I myself was having the lousiest day available, but hell, what about that poor guy at Subway over there? I got an interesting sandwich off him, and it was about $5.30, so I gave him six dollars instead. However, looking upon the cash register, he actually doesn't find the seventy cents extra. I don't think he was particularly happy about this situation, as company rules, never to say "I owe you..." so he asked instead if I had thirty cents, as he gave me back the extra dollar bill. I had to rummage, believe me, in my pockets to find thirty cents, whilst, as I heard from the guy under his breath, "please make this my lucky day..." At last, I found thirty cents, and he got the exact change. He looked somewhat relieved, as he gave me a  broad smile, and a warm thank-you. I left with a good sandwich and he got his exact change. Mutual happiness. And he got 'a lucky day' apparently. Making someone happy, now that's pretty good to give. Perhaps I'm misquoting here, but JFK once said, "It's not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country," as he tried to recruit Peace Corp members. Well, screw trying to get self-satisfaction. I'd say go for the giving for whatever possible.   But then again, there's this other theory...  ...what if, in assumption, he was just having the worst day of his life? What if, as a matter of fact, he was having a bad day because he was being held up by his girlfriend, who he was waiting for at his dayjob? What if, for some strange and bizarre reason, it was because of ANOTHER reason that he wasn't particularly happy, and that he was muttering about something else, besides just a hope that I had a quarter and a nickel? Or three dimes? You sort of wonder after a while, if you mull over somethign for a good ten to fifteen minutes...  ...whatever the case, hope that guy had a lucky day.

      I was just watching "50 First Dates" today by myself, after a series of problems during the morning of a supposedly "organized" get-together to part farewell to one of the greatest friends of mine, Adam. He called me up today to say he can't come, considering that, well, it was the last day before he was to leave for California, and I most likely wouldn't see him for another year. It was sorta depressing, but I guess in a sense it was sort of a "I hate goodbyes" kind of thing. I'll tell you one thing for sure, and that is, I sorta hate it as well.  So here I was, at home, deciding to call off the whole damn thing when all of a sudden, my mother conveniently decides to not pay her phone bills. Actually, the telephone company (imagine) FORGOT to give us the stupid phone bills so I was stuck not being able to CALL them. So, hell, what do I do? I just go, knowing that, after people told me that they still don't know if they were coming or not. And the plan was, that, well, they would  call me  under the circumstance they would or wouldn't. Guess I really couldn't know, so I went for myself. So what happened? No one actually came. Understandable.  The plan was that it would be a function from 2 - 6 p.m. at this mall, and we'd just 'go with the flow.' Well, it turns out, the flow was just plain ol' me, and I decided, that, with ten bucks, the cheapest way to spend it was just watching a couple of movies and burning out four hours of my life. It was pretty fun though... I'll tell you that. Well, hopefully, everyone else had fun doing whatever they did for that amount of time doing whatever, and hope no one'll hate me for the fact that, hey, I didn't answer my phone!  Awful quiet in my house though, minus my brother's temper tantrum... heh heh.

      over the past two weeks, some amazing things have happened on television. true, amazing reality. this was, of course, in japan.  1.) a man, who won two hundred million yen, donated all the money to a city just wrecked by a large storm, wanting his name anonymous, with a false address and name. stupidity? perhaps. crazy? i guess so. kind, generous, what we could need more of (besides that large amount of donations from one person)? yes, one hundred percent. i'd say that two amazing miracles happened. that two hundred million yen (approximately 1.7 million dollars) was given to people who desperately needed to rebuild homes after massive storms, and second, that that large amount of money was actually won in the first place. somebody got lucky numbers. there was also a commerical the other day like it: it pretty much went that ONE bird COULD crap on someone's head in the city of tokyo... it might not happen to us, but it happens. i'd say that's another way of putting lottery into an analogy. a single bird flying around, maybe crapping on your head.  2.) japan and jordan played in the asian cup today. japan tied 1-1, after two overtimes, and finally went into a p.k. japan missed the first two penalties, and jordan scored them, and afterwards, japan won the next three penalties, while jordan only managed to win one of the next three. the keeper, kawaguchi, saved the next four goals, and won japan into the semi-finals. it's rare that a professional match of that level could in fact allow for the japanese to win after missing the first two penalties, and win the next four of five penalty shots, and have jordan make two, then make only one of the next five. of course, we could think of it in a few ways:  a) the next few jordan players could not shoot penalties at all, even though they made it to the quarter-finals. b) the next few jordan players could shoot penalties, just not on that day with the same amount of pressure mounting as the japanese players. c) the goalkeeper kawaguchi was a slow starter and could save miracle shots just very simply.. d) the goalkeeper for jordan couldn't save, and the first two misses were flukes against japan. e) the goalkeeper for jordan got tired.  of course, there are more possibilities, but... well, miracle for japan!

      midnight... i'm sleep as hell, and i'm closing my eyes as i write (type) this, because i want to go to bed, and i'm probably going to drift off into sleep as i blog at the moment. funny thing is, this isn't really anythign special with a particular theme, but it's mroe blabbing. don't worry, it won't be as long as the last. a friend of mine was talking about flames and what-not, and i have to say, that lamely, i keep bouncing back form one person to the next. it's weird, because once i get over one person, i just get onto antoher. testosterone, or something. i seem to settle and i think i'm done now, maybe i've just given up hope. it's so pathetic, really, and you know, sometimes you can't help it. new flames, old flames. the great part was that every rejection was mercifully short, but without the bitter chill to it. it was just a small sting, a little bit of a down feeling, but something you could bounce back from.  i guess i'm done with that. i guess college's all about that. all about finding new people. you can't really do that in a small high school, especially since if it's a population of, what three hundred? and maybe about forty high-schoolers in total? but then again, people get lucky. a friend, Max, talked to me about "people dating for popularity" that "it must be the case that the two most popular kids in the grade go out." i have to question that. he just came from a huge school in miami to this small school, and you know, i think it was really vague. stereotypical. i mean, why? why does it have to be that way? are people so shallow? i put my largest doubts on it. i guess it's in a sense what one could call "conspiratorial."  why bother thinking about what other people say? it's none of our business, and we can't here it. if they really talk behind our backs, forget it! if that's what they want to do with their lives, well, their problem. growing up's part of high school.

      i learned something new today. i was actually surfing on the 'recently downloaded' thing on blogger (there are some interesting stuff out there...) and i stumbled across one with one of my friend's name on. It was sorta funny, because just for a second i thought she started blogging too. well, obviously it turns out that she wasn't, and little did i know that her name was translated into something completely different. on a blog called "my aisling," her name was defined as, in gaelic/ irish as "vision, or dream." direct translation of this certain blog was "my vison/ my dream." and i thought my name meant something. goes to show that parents DO think about their kids' names not from the ring of it, neh? and in contrast, my parents named me "fast horse." my sir name is "big field," possibly changing to "tree village." either way, sounds very native american, don't you think?

      i only have a week until i'm out of here, and i really don't like the feeling. it's been such a great trip to be here, and i have a feeling of regret as i realize that i have to go back. i guess i like the serenity and peace here, the feeling that i'm not panicking, or scared of something, frustrated by the need that i have to do something. and most of all, it's so much easier here, life. the internet's fast, t.v.'s always great (oh come on, we have to be shallow SOMETIMES), and being here with relatives again and family. who could really ask for more? there' s nothing wrong at all about here, nothing. what can i ask for? i've done here what i couldn't achieve in a year, and that was to relax. stress free. least likely now to have a goddamn nervous breakdown. or so it seems.  it was only last month that school ended. only a month when i bid farewell to so many people, friends and acquaintances. a month or two i'd want to rewind and start over and do over again, because of things i regret doing.   can't look back. have to look forward.

      it seems like i've been doing a lot of late-night blogs lately... which means that under most circumstances, i've been staying up late and sleeping during the day... meaning, like my dear cousin, i'm beginning to pick up his habits of being nocturnal instead of, rather, diurnal. seems like i have something to talk about in the nighttime anyway. maybe my brain's beginning to take a different gear forward. i actually got a song stuck in my head today, one that i haven't heard in forever. you know the musical, "cats?" the one that used to be a big hit by i-forget-his-name-but-someone-supposedly-famous? anyway, one song, called "memories" just popped into my head. i don't even know the lyric to teh whole song, but i know the tune in general, so that really caught on quick. and then like every other idea i get, something else has to catch on, and then it just goes on and on and on... it's real weird because my brain continually cahnges subjects whenever it can, even now as i'm writing this. it constantly changes, so i'm going to have to force the subject back again...  ...memories... it seemed only a year or so back when i actually arrived at this new "home." the term's so funny these days. so different from new orleans, and definitely a change of culture. so far, one out of every twenty person has actually heard the country "zambia," and out of them, maybe one in ten people have heard of "lusaka." so many good people have i met here... it wasn't hard to find. unlike newman, in which it took ages, and people changed so quickly, that you didn't know if they were your friends the next day at times. oh, you had people like will who always looked out for you, adn what-not. but it seemed i knew less people there. sure, i got my first taste of love in new orleans, but i screwed up real bad there. and it seems like second chances of that nature are hard to find. maybe i just changed too much.  i wrote a piece called "memory lane." this is pretty much my blab on what was there.   time always moves forward. you can never go back, at least, not with the present stuff. we can always look back, but it's always just an empty shell. the only reason why it was so alive was that it had the life of present tense. the present is for the iving, the past is dead. it will never really return again, and if it does, it will never be the same again. that's the point of living in the present. to savor it, because in the end, it'll become the past, an empty shell of what we call "memories." the term "present" is absolutely hilarious, because as we speak, present immediately turns into past. every step you take in memory lane, the moment that you lean forward to walk, the moment that you decide to take that step even, you have already walked past something of memory lane. that present has turned to past. every hour, every minute, every second, every moment. i think stephen king's "langoliers" made the best sense. the past gets eaten up by these creatures because they are needless, because it will be dead. no life is in the past, it only lives on in memory. the present is filled with those alive, the past is gone and gets eaten away, and the future is always being prepared, set up, and you have to understand that while the future is created, the past is destroyed, and the present is just the flow tha tallows something from "created" to "destroyed."  i know one of my largest flaws is that i look back at the past too much. i always look back, and i always see the past. i rarely look forward, because when i do, i always seem to look too far foward, something that won't take place for a while yet. but when i do, it seems like my logic is to say, "being that far away, it will come too soon." too soon... i worry so much, because it always seems like my sixteen years was a blink, so i think that the inevitable's a blink as well. i worry too much about the future. and the past? i always look at the good old days, wishing they would come back. good memories, and wishing with envy i could relive them again, rather, redo some again. i've made mistakes too many times that i wouldn't ever want to repeat again, but it always seems like i do. people say to "live your life with regret," but it seems like when i try, i always do. what does that say? my heart is full of doubt, and i have myself to blame.  it's hard to walk forward, and live in the present when people say to "don't look back," or "don't look forward." it's like telling someone to not think about something. that idea then springs to your mind, and then you can't ever think it out again. that's the problem with our brains... ones we don't want to think, when we consciously don't want to think, always spring to mind. then when you want to get rid of them, they won't. it'll always be in a corner of your mind, until you get your mind subconsciously on something else. then it disappears forever.  sometimes, i wish that the people i know i've made mistakes towards would see this blog. i guess i look back at the past filled with regrets because i realize that some, which can be fixed and partially mendable for the future, are not. i guess it always starts with an apology, or it starts somehow with a phrase or word. i guess i owe so many people apologies that i want to deny that i don't, that in the end, i have to look back to relive them again. egotistic, isn't it? the fact that i want to mend something seems to be that it's for me. who can say? i guess in the end, it's always just for us. love, anger, despair, sorrow... but  i guess some of these help in the end, don't they?  i made a very large mistake recently that i want to undo. logic says that i can't go back in time, so it must be mended now, while it's all fresh. and an apology is probably what's needed, and hopefully with time one forgiven and brought back. memory lane...once you walk past something, that is gone forever. so you have to do something the second that you DON'T walk past it.  i hate to be so corny at this stage, but... you have to seize the moment. carpe diem. sieze the day.

      You know how we all say, "Hey, this guy's changed?" if you haven't seen someone in a while? I've been told that a number of times. Seems like most of the time, it's true. According to everyone, I used to be extremely energetic, hyper, and at most times, I used to laugh too often. I took a psych test, and turns out I was rather energetic. I took that same psych test about a year later, and turns out now I'm cautious. You should try taking it, Here it is:  Don't peek but begin the test as you scroll down and answer. Answers are for who you are now ... not who you were in the past.    Have pen or pencil and paper ready.

Interpretations:   OVER 60 POINTS: Others see you as someone they should "handle with care". You're seen as vain, self-centred, and who is extremely dominant. Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.   51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.   41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the centre of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.   31 TO 40 POINTS: Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.  21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.   UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything. They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.

      So here I am, typing at five in the morning Japan time, and I'm already pretty damn tired. I mean, I stayed up the whole night, with nothing to do but really think about things over again. It's been a little crazy, this summer. I mean, I've had small little surprises, and then I've had huge shocks.   I've got a couple more weeks till I have to go back, and honestly, that little desire of staying and never going back is beginning to seep in. Honestly, I wonder at times what the point of a home is elsewhere, when all you want to do is stay at one specific spot on a summer vacation. I guess home's been a little redefined lately. Then the funny thing is why I even want to come back here, even though I know that I'm going to feel like this again anyway. Really, it's somewhat disgusting. That even though I'm going to love going back here, and hate leaving this place like hell, and that I'm going to be down for over a month and finally get over it once I get back to school, I still return. Maybe it's about family, and maybe it's just the urge to be away from things. I don't know.  I read some blogs from Naomi's, and while she's at a job in Ireland over the summer, I've been really doing jack squat. Honestly. My day fully consists of practicing my flute (just did), playing lots of tennis, blogging (which I haven't done lately due to my lack of inspiration), studying mathematics and Japanese, and e-mailing a bunch of friends. These days however, it seems like everyone's gone and they really don't have much chance to get on a computer. Actually, I just got my laptop back a couple days back, so I'm feeling good myself to be using my own computer. For one, I can actually type a lot faster and that really is like heaven in a sense.  Played my first tennis match since a month, and I have to say that my view of the tennis world has expanded. I lost today 6-1, 6-1, and that pretty much explains most of it. I mean, o f course, you miss the little tid bit details like what the hell really happened, but you get the general idea that I lost. I can't  really say from this score that I gave a good fight against my opponent, but I sure the hell did my best. Actually, not particularly true, because I got too nervous for three quarters of the game, and  when I finally did get my game, I pretty much lost it by then. Yes, my excuse. Question it, I don't care. See if you can do any better here. However, I can promise you that next time I play against the same  person, I'll be ready, and I'll sure as hell win. Score doesn't count for this time, it'll count for next time. It's like that song goes... "I get knocked down, I get back up..." or something like that. I guess the biggest thing that's rubbed off on me this year is Heitmann, our basketball coach and history teacher (eccentric as hell, but definitely one of the best teachers we have), and his flat refusal to lose. He would refuse at any given time to quit on us, and he managed to get us to lose only once. That's pretty amazing stats for our school and our small community, and I can tell you now, we can sure as hell play better next season. What was admirable was that he managed to get us to win from what seemed like an absolutely horrible situation where most of the people watching were thinking we'd lost. I mean, we were twenty points down at the end of the first half, and Heitmann was furious. I mean, we all could feel the goddamn tension and anger and frustration going through him! So he takes to the running track, and we all get this sinking feeling he's going to make us do laps before the second half. But instead, he gives us a speech, and swears enough to make any faint-hearted parent, well, faint. And we managed to only let them take two points off us, and we won the game. Pretty inspiring stuff.   However, he did ditch us once for a history lesson after we came in late (after an inexcusable time period). Understandable. Heitmann's got the philosophy that we've got the choice and if we wish to abuse it and waste his time, he's not going to play around. Our fault, so... hey, what can I say?  At 5:00 A.M. though, this wasn't the only thing I was thinking about. I just can't shake off certain problems that I've been faced with, everything a month back (only a month back!). Of course, I've been taking this as paranoia, but then again, what if this was true? After all, she hasn't said hello to me at all for the past month or two, almost. She hasn't replied once, and I'm not exactly feeling lonely or scared, or nervous, but maybe a tad worried. After all, I feel some sort of responsibility for the whole siutation. Maybe she didn't enjoy herself, or maybe I did something and she's not talking to me for it. Did I cross a line that I wasn't supposed to? Did I break taboo? The dilemma here is, do I want  to not know and worry, or do I want to hear the truth, and get the worst. Everyone keeps telling me to not worry about it, if she didn't enjoy herself there, then it's her problem. I can't really believe that, I can't really take that for granted. After all, she took a goddamn long-distance flight and maybe she didn't enjoy herself. What was the point of taking the flight? She wasted a night where she could have at least done something that was far better, and maybe I might not be in this situation.   This kind of thing seems to happen at 5 a.m. I think it's sort of the lack-of-sleep thing.   Getting a tad sleepy...  Well, can't do much about anything from here, I guess. but I'm a natural worrier. After all, my entire class unanimously voted me for "Most Likely to Have A Nervous Breakdown." Great. But I guess all I can really do is just not think about it too much, and just play a lotta tennis, or something like that.

      my parents just the other day decided to complain about my getting a new racket. just a racket that i bought with my own money. i fought for it, i got it, and now they don't like the idea. my dad was complaining about how spoiled i was, and when i decided to get it with the money that i had earned in some ways or another, and WITHOUT asking much for it (my paying over half of the price of the racket), they don't like the idea. honestly, i'm just chasing another dream. seems like most people understand it, but again, understandably, my parents are cautious. scared. nervous that i'm going in too deep, and i'll never get a career. tennis is dangerous. most people can't get a career off it. i play for freedom. you don't need to be concerned about anything else in tennis. you play because you play. taht's all i'm doing until i'm done. i'm just chasing a dream.

      either our world and society is at a declination, or the medical world and governments have voted upon a new definition of handicapped. already, in more than five countries (u.s., u.k., japan, zambia, and south africa) i've been to, regardless of the fact that this is normal or not, i'd say (according to the old rules and what-not) that handicapped parking lots are being abused. now, as i said before, perhaps i'm missing something when a bunch of perfectly healthy families park into a handicapped parking lot, and WALK out of their car. one man walks right into the pole, sees the handicapped sign, shrugs, and walks inside the building. a police officer is right there, sees the whole incident and doesn't give a damn about the scene. five countries, consistently. maybe we've been corrected when an anonymous person said "stupidity is not a handicap... park elsewhere," and perhaps it is a handicap, but then, who would have thought that we've turned into a society where people would admit that, yes, they are stupid. where's their sense of pride and dignity? and then, going back to the whole family story, but who would have thought that whole groups of people would walk out of a car, all being stupid. what are the odds of idiots, who, perhaps needing professional help (as they are stupid) would reproduce? i'm not talking about those people that we can actually SEE having problems. no. i mean those people that look fine, that seem to be able to take care of themselves enough that two stupid couples reproduce to have a stupid son and daughter, who seem to be aware enough of what they do to say "look daddy, it's a handicap sign," and the father replies, "oh, yes, what do you know."   all right. so it seems they're fine, and they don't need professional help. and they still go into a handicap sign. so if it is the case that this is normal, why not just lose the handicap sign. it seems already like it doesn't exist. and i guess no one really seems to mind about real handicapped people, and OBVIOUSLY the government doesn't want to do anything about it. the police obviously don't seem to care, and neither does society.  overreacting? definitely. but showing truth and possility and pure simple logic. definitely. lying? nope.

      it seems like we complain about our privacy a lot. i mean, on the internet, there's always some asshole sending spam. you've got stalkers, you've got newscrews and journalists, and then you've got...  ...hey, who the hell is that plugging a TUBE UP MY NOSE!?  yes, as a matter of fact, there's a guy that looks at the insides of your nose. at least in japan. i mean, you've got doctors for your eyes, doctors for your skin, doctors that look at your insides, and fix stuff, you've got doctors to see if you have a mental problem, so logically, there has to be a doctor that looks at your nose. ugh.   my grandparents a couple days back kept complaining that i kept blowing my nose and that something was wrong with me. hell, i just said that, look, my nose was fine, thank-you-very-much. but after beign sick for a few days, they thought that they should have a specialist look at my nose. great. so yesterday, i went to this nose clinic and what-not to see a nasatologist, i guess, to get my nose checked up. the whole idea was freaky. and i thought going to the dentists sucked.  you know, the whole idea freaks me out. a guy looking right inside of your nose. NASTY! not right. i can't handle it! and then what he does is stick a tube up my nose and starts flooding water... saltwater, mind, into my system. great. so now the guy wants to drown me. perfect! like, yeah, i wanted to be suicidal and had a death-wish and what not. disgusting. doctors... they think of everything to stick stuff into you: tongue depressers, tubes in your throat, and now they want to stick stuff up your nose. great. i think we've redefined "invasion of privacy." NASTY!

      you know, some times, i have my good flights and my bad flights. but then again, upon some planes, i nominate my trips as "worst one yet." presently, the worst flight was from hong kong to fukuoka, the last leg of my whole trip. i was so goddamn tired, so i was sleeping for most of the flight through, until we stopped at taipei to refuel and what not. at first, it was great because the whole plane was pretty much empty, so i was allowed to sit wherever i wanted, except for the business class and first class areas. so here i was, all happy, until we soon hit some massive turbulence. well, it wasn't too bad, but it was all shaky and crap because of this typhoon that was about to hit taipei. so at ths point in time, we had our seatbelts fastened and what not, and i soon find myself in err. i was extremely dehydrated on this particular flight back, and i had drunk massive amounts of water. smart move if you're thirsty, but the dumb part was that i didn't go to the bathroom before the plane took off, and i really, REALLY began to have the urge to go when we were still climbing. so here i am, hoping like hell that i wouldn't wet my pants when finally, i felt that enough was enough and i decided to go. well, a stewardess caught me away from my seat and scolded me, and told me to go back to my seat. moments later, an old fellow, while the stewardess' back is turned, rushes into the bathroom and locks the door. good idea. so i tried this myself after a few minutes, and, just my luck, there was another stewardess who seemed to cover for her. so now i get scolded again.  i was beginning to think about taking desperate measures, when all of a sudden, the shaking stopped. so without thinking, i dashed into the bathroom. just then, the captain switches off the seatbelt sign, and i cursed. just my luck. i was let go right when the turbulence stops.

      i'm finally at home now, and it feels great. the moment i stepped out of the airport, and i felt the hot, humid, summer air rush into me, i could only greet back to it with content. what else was i to do, and what can i say? i'm home now. of course, by this time, it was already 9:00 p.m. local time in japan, and it sure felt as hell like it was two in the afternoon after all that travelling. anyways, so here i was, tired but jetlagged, and we finally made it home at eleven after stopping by at a place for a quick bite to eat (between you and me, i loathe inflight food - most of the time, they taste so nasty!), and by then, my grandparents were so tired, they hit the sack. so here i was, alone, and so i decided that i should check up on my e-mail. i got a bunch of junk mail, but the highlight of it all was that stuart sent me an e-mail down from jo'burg down at south, wishing me a (in advance) happy birthday. of course, the amazing thing was, that was my first honest and true "happy birthday" that i had received from anyone apart from family. it was an odd feeling, but satisfying to know someone remembers, nonetheless. i'd say that, for me, it was one of my greater "welcome home" greetings.
