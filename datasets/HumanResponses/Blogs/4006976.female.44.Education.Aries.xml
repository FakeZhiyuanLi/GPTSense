      Today we got to enter the subdivision again.  I was so grateful that the whole family waited for me to get home from my workshop, even though they had been able to go up since noon.  It was really important to me to be there with everyone at the same time.  It was devastating to stand knee deep in hot ash, digging thru what was left of the house. At first, it was hard to understand why certain things were where they were.  Then we realized that everything upstairs, had fallen directly below and was now in the basement.   We were able to find shards of pottery and remnants of bits and pieces but nothing of real value.  I took lots of photos that day - some of them turned out really well - there is a link to the slideshow I made at the bottom of this post.  What stands out to me the most is how selective the fire was. The house on either side of my mom were lost, as well as two below and yet the one directly below was ok and the houses across the street are untouched. The fire spread with burning embers so there are pockets of devastation as well as waves of fire that took out entire roads. The fire fighters said that the firestorm hit with a wall of fire that was 200 feet high.  Three fire fighters lost their homes but kept on working until it became too dangerous.  One thing the city is proud of is the fact that there has not been one injury or death in this tragedy.  My mom had been on evacuation alert for three days so she was prepared and took almost everything valuable to her.  We have since remembered that she forgot her wedding and prom dresses, as well as our childhood 8 mm movies which she thought that I had. :(  One of the subdivisions hit had no warning so some people didn't get anything out at all and there were some others that just didn't take the alert seriously.  Here's a link to a slideshow of pictures of the house.   urlLink http://sd23.bc.ca/ame/curlew.html

      We have a friend who is a city inspector and he was out working in the neighbourhood and called me on his cell when he was at my mom's lot. He brought us back some perfect tomatoes from her garden....  We were joking that all that was left was fried green tomatoes and baked potatoes....  Today was the first day of the workshop.  Overall things went well and we had a good turnout despite the situation.   It's hard to get back to normal and do every day kinds of things right now - my mind is just not there....

      The bus trip was more interesting and amazing than horrifying. It was unbelievable how the firestorm went through the neighbourhood, hitting some houses and sparing others. We tried to take pictures but it was hard because it was getting dark and we couldn't get off the bus so there was a lot of reflection from the window.  They are planning to allow residents back in the neighbourhood on Friday so I will post some before and after pics for you on the weekend.  A few days ago, all the families from the area went to a local church where we found out whose homes had burned and whose were saved.  When fire chief Gerry Zimmerman entered the room, we gave him a standing ovation.  It was the most touching moment of the evening.  It was hard to actually realize that the house was truly gone but when you see the address in black and white, it's pretty clear.  My mom  was packing before she was even on alert.  She rented a 4X6 storage unit and hauled all her photo albums and momentos from her trips plus all the obvious things one would take.  She forgot a few things though, like her wedding dress and our family's favourite Christmas record albums that we will miss  lot.

      Hi everyone.  The evacuation order for my area, the lower Mission, has been lifted today. It sure feels good to be back in my own house although everythign stinks of smoke and the pool adn yard are black with ash. We are still on one hour evacuation alert but it is extremely unlikely that the fire will have any serious flareups in our area. However, I won't be unpacking anything yet and we'll leave all the stuff over at Jen's until we are off alert. It is still threatening the southern area of the city though and we aren't out of the woods yet. The forecast for the next two weeks is hot and sunny. Why won't it rain?  The city has arranged for buses to take the families of the burned houses up on a drive thru of their neighbourhood so they can have some closure.  They are hoping to open up the area to the rest of the people by the weekend.  My brother and sister and I are hoping to be able to go on the bus with my mom today so she and Rod don't have to go on their own.  She is doing ok over all but it has already been such a shitty year for them with Rod and my Grandma's health declining, and my mom's cancer. Ugh. I feel so bad for them. They've been to the insurance people and are happy with the way things are going with that.  They are planning to start building as soon as possible, not sure if they'll be able to get it started before winter sets in though. They are going to stay with us until October and then are moving into a a one bedroom furnished motel suite until the house is built.

      At my friend's house again. My mom's house was definitely lost, plus 3 of her close neighbours. We're doing ok. I now have to organize this stupid workshop for 200 people on thurs and fri from my motorhome. ugh. We found a new venue and are trying to let everyone know as well as make adaptations to be ready.  So many people are evacuated that it's hard to find teachers who can come and help do the set up.    Thanks for all our good thoughts. We saw mom's house on the news yesterday. it's awful.

      I'm at a friend's house, using her computer. Probably won't have much chance to use it again but will try to check in once a day. Our house is fine so far.   Friday night was horrendous. At the last moment, as the police cars were driving thru the neighbourhood telling us to get out immediately, Jesse locked the keys in my car. I was so distraught. Ernie was trying desperately to break into the car, the police were telling us to hurry, we'd heard on Castanet that the fire was at the end of Gordon road, which is only a mile or so away.  I remembered that my brother Gordy had an extra van key on our truck key set when he took the pickup to his place but he was 8 miles away on the other side of the road block.  I phoned and luckily he answered.  I told him he'd have to try to get through the road block  and that I would run down to meet him.  I ran down to the corner and asked the police if they'd let him through - it was the longest 20 minutes I ever had to wait. Finally he arrived with the second set of keys and we drove back home to open up the van and get out of there.    We drove back to Gordy's house and parked the motorhome in the backyard.  He only has a little 2 bedroom house so Ernie, Jesse, and I are sleeping in the motorhome, Mom and Rod are in the 2nd bedroom, and Angie has gone to stay with Carly and Tom at their apartment.  The Farquhars are staying in a friend's house across the lake.  Vanessa called Angie today and said they think their house may have been lost - they were watching the entire area up in flames with a telescope on Friday night.  As for my mom's place, we think it's gone. That area was badly hit. Over 200 homes were lost last night and more expected tonight when the wind picks up. I just looked at the thermal shots on the castanet website and the fire is clearly over my mom's house. Unless the shots aren't that accurate, it's gone. This whole thing is like a night mare for our city. Unbelievable. Gotta run now. Will post more later or else whenever I get back into my house.   We went into the evacuation centre this afternoon to register.  Overwhelming emotion that hits you when you walk in that place and realize you are one of "those" people.  The tears welled up and it was hard to answer the questions for the volunteers.  The people there are amazingly helpful and compassionate - in  fact, they are so nice, it almost makes it harder.  Mom and I are both in tears everytime someone says something "nice".  Fire Chief Gerry Zimmerman has been amazing.  Unlike the Barriere fire, he has been extremely open with the people and with the media, keeping us constantly updated and trying his best to let us know what is happening all the while, fighting the fire.  Kelowna is very proud.  All the kids at my school are evacuated so school start up is in question now. Many of them have lost their homes. Oh and also, it looks like our old house that we loved so much up in Crawford estates is gone too. And about 8 others that we built for other people in that subdivision.   Bye for now.

      They're evacuating a 1/2 km  from me. We're next. In case the power goes out, this will be my last email.    You can hear the police car loud speakers telling everyone to "leave immediately - this is an evacuation order!".  Jesse got tired of hearing them as he sat in the car waiting for us to finishing packing, and hollered back "We ARE evacuating!"  Too bad a kid his age has to even undertsand what evacuation means.  Wish us luck. We may be offline for a week or two.  Don't worry, we're safe.  Bye guys....

      We are now packing frantically.  They have evacuated another street closer to us. The fire is still far from us though. I will post just before we leave if we have to go.  However, the power might go out. We have a generator but I don't know if ernie will think the computer is a priority... ;)  Ernie and I just got back from dropping off the binders and thought we'd pick up a BBQ chicken for supper - nobody's been eating much and making dinner seemed almost like an after thought. In the parking lot of the grocery store, we could feel the heat from the fire and the smoke cloud above the Mission was horrifying.  It looked like a giant storm.  A really hot wind was blowing and chunks of burning houses were landing everywhere.  We both sensed something serious.  We raced thru the grocery store grabbing the stuff we needed and raced home.  When we got there, Angie had her entire room packed into her jeep, Mom and Rod were almost packed (from our place) and ready to go, and we were in the midst of packing up our stuff into the motorhome, pickup, and minivan.  It's been such a freaky day. All you can hear are sirens and airplanes and helicopters. It feels like war.

      Big winds now.  Just heard the fire guard has been breached in two areas - one of them is Curlew, the street mom lives on.  Winds are supposed to stay until around 10 pm. We have more smoke in the air now than any other day, if that's possible...  Ernie and Jens have been moving big stuff out of the house all day and getting the motorhome ready to travel just in case. He took Angie's drumset and our guitars over there as well as my boxes of photo albums and other important business papers.  Right now, we're heading back over to the school and pick up 25 boxes of binders and evacuate them to Jen's.  We will probably have to change the workshop venue but I'll worry about that on another day.  What do you take when you evacuate?  What's important?  My heart has been pounding all day - a constant adrenaline rush.  I wonder how long you can survive at that level?

      Here's a recap and update.  Last night was an unbelievable night.  Around 7:00 pm my mom called me to say that huge military helicopters were hauling buckets of water right in front and right over her house.  She has a home on a hill with a beautiful lake view in a subdivision in the trees on the outskirts of Kelowna. At the time, the fire was several kilometres south of her area, and there was at least one subdivision between her and the outermost edge of the forest. There had been spot fires happening occasionally when burning embers were carried by the wind several km's away. We heard many many fire trucks screaming their way up the hill to the area close to fire.  The fire station is about a half km from our house and it's the only road in and out of the affected area.    Around that same time, the family of a friend of Angie's called to find out in our offer to take them in still stood and of course we said yes.  They didn't think it would be needed but were just checking in case the fire got worse. It had been so quiet all day we thought we were going to be ok since the wind hadn't picked up as expected.   After I hung up, I went back to my radio which was giving 24 hour coverage, and heard that the evac alert would be changed to an evac order.  I immediately called my mom and the other family and let them know.  Within minutes, tons of packed up cars began streaming down the hill blocking every possible access route in and out.  Many cars of people who had been away from their home for the evening were trying to get back up in the affected area to get their stuff and were being denied access.  Home videos were shown on TV of the fire right behind the subdivision by my mom's house but the worst hit area was about 2-3 km further down the road where about 25 homes were eventually burned to the ground.  Most of those were $500,000+ and some are uninsurable because they are out of the fire protection district.   Mom and Rod were more or less ready to go and managed to get down the 5 minutes trip within about 20 minutes. The other family arrived at our place about 2 hours later.  They had done no packing up until that point because nobody really believed that they'd have to evacuate. The traffic was so heavy some people took 2 hours to travel a 10 minute ride. We stood out in the front driveway watching the fire light up the entire mountain to the south of us, eventually we got lawn chairs and sat there with the radio on just watching the flames (and drinking beer ;).  We went in to bed at about 1 am but I couldn't sleep most of the night - I was listening to the radio and hearing people call in to tell what they were seeing.    People who live across the lake could get an excellent view of the entire fire now that the smoke had cleared somewhat.  With binoculars, they could see houses burning etc. There were also reports of burning embers landing in areas near us so at about 11 pm, they announced that everyone south of Mission Creek was on evac alert which meant us.  I didn't bother to pack anything up, but I did write a list of stuff to take and now this morning, I'm going to pack up the essentials and have them ready to go.  I am heading in to the school right now and check out what the plan is.  80% of our student population has been evacuated from their homes and the school is in the evac alert area so I have no idea how we're gong to start up school just over a week from now. Over 10,000 people in 3800 homes have been evacuated and 2000 more homes are on one hour alert.  The forecast for this afternoon is for wind, lightening, and possible showers but they will probably amount to nothing as they usually do at this time of year. If I get evacuated, I'll try to post before I leave, but if I suddenly disappear, I'll have to post once I'm back in my house.  Gotta go pack now.  Bye.

      Now I'm on evacuation alert.  I truly don't believe that it will ever come to being evacuated but who knows.  There are so many houses between me and the fire.  It's a wild night.  We're all sitting out front in the driveway, watching the flames on the hillside to the south of us.  During the day, it's so smoky you can't see anything but at night, when the trees candle, it's an unbelievably scary show.  We have a full house tonight.  Mom and Rod in the guest room, Andrew and Stephanie in Angie's room, Angie and Vanessa and Jacklyn on foamies in the living room.  Ernie hasn't been taking any of this seriously but he said he will start moving some of our stuff over to Jen's place tomorrow.  If we get evacuated, all of us will ahve to find places to stay.  Either at Gordy's or maybe at Jen's.  Guess I should go pack something.

      The wind just picked up and now they've just changed Mom and Rod's evacuation alert to an evacuation order.  1050 families are now packing up and getting out. Two families are coming to my house. Wow. Scary stuff. The helicopters and fire engines are going crazy.    Mom and Rod stayed overnight with us last night because they didn't want to be evacuated in the middle of the night. Today they went back home and spent the afternoon packing up more stuff as the fires get closer.  Mom called me a little while ago to tell that the helicopters were bucketing directly over her house.  She said it felt like M*A*S*H.    I have been watching the TV news, listening the the radio, and watching the Castanet website all day long.  I can't stop. I heard the evacuation order come through and called mom to tell her.  Also called another family who had asked if they could stay with us in the event they were evacuated.  Neither of them had even heard.  More later.

      The fire is actually much better today.  It's been very stable all night and they are currently building a huge fire break along the miles of forest behind the houses. We're all just crossing our fingers that the wind doesn't pick up this afternoon as is forecast.  The smoke is horrendous though.  I will try to post some pics of it but I don't know if it will do it justice.

      The sky is unbelievable today - it's like nuclear fallout.  The sun is just a faint red ball and the smoke is incredibly thick.  We're trying to keep the doors shut but it just filters in through the cracks.   I have a headache and it's so hard to sleep at night. Ugh.  I am feeling stressed because I have to get this huge workshop organized for teachers next week.  I am trying to spend time helping my mom pack up stuff, get the handouts photocopied and into binders, and still live a normal life for my kids.  Today we spent all afternoon locked up in a friend's basement, stuffing handouts into binders.  Three friends were able to come and help me.  It was so hot and stuffy in there.  I have about 25 big boxes of finished binders ready for the workshop next week.  I'm going to drop them off at the school where the workshop will take place but I'm a little worried that we may end up being evacuated and have to move them out again.

      It's been so weird today.  There's so much smoke, you can barely see the sun and everything thing has an eery orange tinge to it.  We couldn't see what the fire was doing all day because of the smoke but apparently it's still burning away from Kelowna.  All day, white ash fell like a light snow flurry.  Ernie's throat has been scratchy and the smoke really bugs him.  For me, it just burns my nose, but I've been thinking about all the people like your kids who have asthma etc.  The air quality is extremely bad right now.

      The fire has grown from 5500 acres yesterday morning to 33,000 acres this afternoon.  It has been so smoky all day we can't see what is going on, but for the most part the fire spread a lot to the south, which is away from the city.  Unfortunately, that direction is headed directly for my Aunt and Uncle's house in Naramata.  Tonight the wind is supposed to switch back to the north and start blowing it back towards Kelowna again.  It's about 3 km from my mom's house.  She has rented a storage unit and has moved all of her photos and important stuff.  Every day that she's on alert, she finds more things to move though.  She is so stressed out...

      Hi again,    Just got back from our trip to Vancouver Island.  While we were gone, Angie and Mom both called to tell me that another forest fire had started. This time it's practically in my own back yard.  It started on Monday night - this time a lightning strike in Okanagan Mountain Park, about 5 miles from my Mom's house.  My mom lives in a subdivision in the hills and is on one hour evacuation alert.  She wants me to come and pick up the 30 quarts of dills she just did...  lol.  I took pics of the fire from the Coquihalla Highway as we drove into town - it's unbelievable.  I don't think we're in any danger because there are plenty of houses between us and the forest but my mom might not so lucky.    It's weird to be going through this again so soon after the Barriere fire.  My BIL and SIL are back in their hotel btw, but they had quite a bit of smoke damage.  The fire fighters stayed in the hotel during the evacuation.  Louis Creek and Barriere town have been hit pretty hard.  Weeks later, the power is still out too...  I'll keep you posted.

      Hi guys - I'm back from our August long weekend trip.  OK, this is a long story.  We had an unbelievable start to our camping weekend due to the forest firesrunning rampant up here.  We left on Thursday, July 31, 2003 at noon, heading for my sister's cabin which is about a 6 hour drive away, but we planned to stay overnight at Ernie's brother's hotel in the small town ofBarriere, about halfway to the cabin.  About 20 minutes away from their hotel, we saw a smallish forest fire being fought in the hills on one side of the highway.  It was just one of many small fires in BC right now, but I took some pictures of it since it was so close.  It was a super hot day, well over 100 degrees and our a/c was barely keeping us cool, and when we opened the windows, it was like sitting by an open oven door.   When we got to the hotel about 4 pm, we found out two of Ernie's nephews and 4 kids were there so it was nice to see some more family and for Jesse to have someone to play with. We talked a bit about the fire which has started the day before by a careless smoker. The fire was under control and some of the firefighters were actually staying at the hotel.  About 50 of them were expected at the hotel restaurant for dinner at 6 pm.     Around that same time, a sudden wind storm blew through, so hard it actually blew an open door of the hotel right off its hinges.   About an hour later, the valley began to fill with smoke, coming down the highway,  as well as over the hill behind the hotel. There was even light ash falling from the sky.  The hotel has a pub so we got lots of news from towns people coming and going from the restaurant and pub.  Apparently the wind had caused the fire to jump the firebreak and it was now out of control and growing quickly. Within about 5 hours, it had spread 6 km down the highway and was now only about 4 km down the road, threatening a small settlement called Louis Creek on the outskirts of Barriere.  People in Louis Creek had been put on evacuation notice and many were coming into town to find places to stay.  At about 9 pm, we learned that my BIL's accountant's house, as well as several others in Louis Creek, had been destroyed by fire.    My SIL Bonnie began to get worried that it might get to Barriere and she started packing up even though we hadn't received any evac. warnings.  We all thought she was over-reacting but we helped her pack up her pictures, and clothes and mementos into the car and truck.  At about 9:30, we heard that the fire was very close to the hydro lines and the power would be out within an hour, and likely wouldn't be back on for two to three days. This was going to be a real problem since the hotel was full and the restaurant fridges and freezers were full of food. We watched the 11pm news and learned how bad the fire back become and how quickly it had grown but nobody believed that the town of Barriere was in any danger at that time. Sure enough, at about 11:30 the power went out.  It was still stifling hot and so smoky my eyes were burning. We finally went to bed just after midnight but it was hard to sleep because of the heat and the smoke (we were in our motorhome), and also b/c we were hearing cars driving up and people talking every once in a while.   I woke up at 6 am and listened to the news and heard the fire had grown even more.  At about 8 am we got a one hour evacuation notice and we all started helping Ben and Bonnie pack up the rest of their stuff.  My nephew hooked up his camper and got ready to leave at a moment's notice.  The smoke was heavy and lots of ash and even burned leaves and pine needles covered everything.  We hung around and waited as long as we could to get more news and to see what was going to happen.  Ben and Bonnie were hoping to travel one hour south down a country road to get to the next major town of Kamloops where they had friends to stay with while they waited out the evacuation.  Their other option was to travel north and then take the long way to Vancouver. We planned to continue heading north to get to my sister's cabin where we were planning to spend the weekend.  I took pictures of the red smoke billowing over the hillside and it looked like the flames would reach the peak at any moment.  We were in direct line of fire and it was scary but we still didn't believe that it would actually get to the town.    Ernie and I finally left Barriere at about noon, not knowing exactly when Ben and Bonnie would be leaving or where they would go. The nephews had decided to go north and travel back to Vancouver.  On the way out of town, I took some great shots of the smoke and fire in the distance.  We only had a 1/4 tank of gas and all the power was out for the next 100 miles so no gas stations were open. We managed to make it to a gas station where there was a huge line up of cars and evacuees all trying to get gas.    Eventually we made it to the cabin where we spent the rest of the weekend.  Unfortunately we had no cell service so we couldn't call my BIL and see if they made it to their destination. That night, we were able to get in one channel on our TV in  the camper and we watched the news.  The announcer said that the fire had reached Barriere in the afternoon and that it was so out of control that the firefighters had had to pull out.  The entire town (pop. 2500 people) was on fire and it looked like it was going to be completely destroyed.  I was just shaking by this time.  It seemed unbelievable that I had just been there a few hours earlier.  The next morning we watched the news again and the reports were conflicting.  Some said the town was gone, others said only a few homes and businesses had been burned.  But even worse, a second fire had started up overnight, closer to Kamloop so now the entire highway was closed and no one could even get in or out of Barriere from the south.  We drove into a town nearby to find a phone booth and managed to find out that Ben and Bonnie and their kids had left about 1 pm and were now in Vancouver.    All weekend, while we were at the cabin, we watched the news reports and heard how both fires were completely out of control and were the worst seen in the province in 50 years. Over 8500 people had been evacuated in all.  When another fire broke out just south and east of Kamloops, the third big fire over the weekend, the Premier declared a State of Emergency in the whole province.  Three major highways have been closed, four towns and many smaller settlements have been completely evacuated and 100's of homes and businesses have been burned.  The weather is making it hard to fight these fires b/c we've been 43 days without a drop of rain and the temps for that last month have been over 85 and often over 100.  The forecast for the next 10 days is for more sun and heat and wind.  There are also thundershowers in the forecast which means the start of more fires.   We left the cabin this morning and had to travel the long way home but made it home this afternoon.  We still haven't had a chance to talk to Ben and Bonnie but late last night while watching the news, I saw a brief shot of their hotel, still intact. We don't know when they will be able to go home.    Unbelievable.
