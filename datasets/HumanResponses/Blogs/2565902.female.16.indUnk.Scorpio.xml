      The last couple of days have been interesting.  First, I'm talkin to steph, its like 1 AM on Monday Morning, and she goes I miss you, and so we discussed old camp memories.  I began to cry, quite nostolgic, so she called me.  I talked to her for like an hour, sitting, huddled in a blanket on the rocker in my greenhouse.  I miss Steph, she's so fun.   Monday was lunch with Dani, then practice (not highly reccommended, McDonalds then bball...) but then I  had spaghetti with my family and went to nicole's.  Twas a good time, she was crazy off her medicine, and we watched Jeepers Creepers 2.  I had a guy follow me to Nicole's...twas scary, and odd...  Today I went shopping with Nicole at Southridge, we shopped, we laughed, we became frustrated, twas all good though.  Then,  I had a basketball game, which we won, twas fun...sorta....kinda. I played for awhile, had some rebounds, etc. al.   I hate staying for varsity games..o well...i lived...actually it was kinda fun, i had some good conversation with Jones.  Twas fun, we discussed Cudahy, and Gary Indiana, mustard, roadrunner,  license plates and chem.  Yes I know, random, yet interesting.  Well, my break has been going extremely well, I am excited for  New Years Eve and days following.  I do love not having school.  QOTD " The suns gonna shine and the rains gonna fall, and in the end you might get wet or even burnt, but thats life, so dance in the puddles and bathe in the sun and at the end of the day, SMILE, everythings gonna be alright."   Passage of the day Ps 37: 5-6 and 23-24  "Commit your ways to the Lord, trust in him and HE will do this.  He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.  If the Lord delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm; though he stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand."

      Today was another excellent day in my break.  It is going excellent.  First I went to church, and I realized how great God is.  That was refreshing.  Then I took a nap, and while I was napping Anna called, and asked me to coffee.  We went to Alterra, downtown, and it was a good time.  Although now, I think that she is just TRYING to get me addicted to caffine.  And it is working!  Then Shelly and I went and saw Paycheck. It was excellent, I highly reccommend it.  Also she had a surprise for me.  Mountain Dew Livewire.  It was excellent, I missed it to so much.  I was going to save it, but the expiration date was tomorrow, so I snuck it in and drank it.  Ahh good times were had by all.  We had a family dinner, then I went to Kohls and bought pants, as mine are to big.  It was fun, I love my mom so much.  I had a funny convo with Nicole, which no one would understand, but Steph told me an excellent story.  Steph Pflughoeft (8:28:18 PM): know what i did Steph Pflughoeft (8:28:39 PM): i watched the spanish channel for like an hour  SMtennisguRL06 (8:29:34 PM): u dont speak spanish sweets.... Steph Pflughoeft (8:29:40 PM): i know Steph Pflughoeft (8:29:42 PM): but Steph Pflughoeft (8:29:45 PM): i did catch Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:03 PM): something about a convict, a dead guy, and a supermarket Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:23 PM): and there was this FUNNY commercial@ Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:23 PM): lol SMtennisguRL06 (8:30:42 PM): but u didnt understand... how did u kno it was funny? Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:43 PM): heres my english translation: Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:46 PM): lol Steph Pflughoeft (8:30:56 PM): i am guessin i think this is what happened SMtennisguRL06 (8:30:58 PM): u dont kno the spanish to translate.... Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:09 PM): i think this guy was like "honey can i watch tv" Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:29 PM): and shes like "yeah but we have to leave as soon as i finish the dishes" Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:42 PM): and he like laughs cuz theres a ton of grimy dishes Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:44 PM): and then Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:48 PM): heres the good part Steph Pflughoeft (8:31:58 PM): he sits down with his popcorn and whatnot Steph Pflughoeft (8:32:05 PM): and then like 2 seconds later Steph Pflughoeft (8:32:13 PM): shes like ok hun lets go Steph Pflughoeft (8:32:27 PM): and hes like shocked until he looks and sees that she washed with dawn   I miss Steph.  I adore my Phlegm, yet I never get to see her.  Awwww how I love that girl! We also had a convo about football, but I think you had to be there to think it was funny.  Hebrews 11:1"Now Faith is Being sure of what we hope for, and certain of what we do not see."

      Hey- I started this for a few reasons. One, Anne and Beth inspired me. Two, I'm extremely bored, and it's 10:00 on a Saturday Night...Therefore giving me a reason to do this. It's sorta a venting page. OR a random thought page. OR anything I want page. Hahahaha.  Creative control!  So break has been awesome so far. Tuesday I got to hang out at Katie's with her, Matt and Scottie.  Twas fun, they scared me to death by making me watch Halloween 2.  I've never seen the first one, so I was confused AND scared.  Also, my Jr. Staff App. came in the mail.  Quite nostalgic..... Wednesday I had some family over, the church service with all the little Zion kiddies was adorable. Thursday I got my iPod, and went to my aunt's.  Had much fun with cousin Sarah.  Friday Basketball began again...little did I know 3 days could get you that out of shape!  Also Nicole and I had milkshakes, and the Milkshake song was on.  Quite Ironic, don't you think? Today I again had practice, and then went Ice Skating with Anna at Red Arrow. We had Starbucks, my peppermint Mocha was AMAZING!  That's it.    Also, you are the candy bar in my shoe.  Bible passage of the day:  John 1:16 "From the fullness of his grace, we have received one blessing after another." wow.  so true.

      Hey guys.  This week was the best one I've had in a really long time.   Yesterday was fun, I really don't know why, it just was.  We lost our game, it was sad. However, we had good time at the Varsity game, and we had a team pizza party thing after.  It was a good time.  Today was really good. I woke up late, like 11, and then the phone rang.  It was Nicole, wanting to run.  SO I packed a bag, got in my car and drove over.  We ran for a while, then we wound up just talking at Blakewood.  She told me some really sad news...  Then we went to Subway for lunch (look @ us healthy girls!!)  and we went back and started a movie.  After that, I went to the library.  Got some books, and now I am home. I cleanded myroom. Tonite some girls are coming over to watch movies and play board games.  That's Super Exciting!  QOTD-"Wherever you are, it is your friends who make your world." -- Henry James  POTD-"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."  John 15:12-13

      Hey y'all!  Today is Thursday...and here's how the week has gone.  Monday we had off, was fun, Jennee and I did decoration stuff all day, I had practice.  Then a co-cirricular meeting. Tuesday we were supposed to have a game, it was canceled, so we just had practice.  So then yesterday we really had our game, we won.  I was captain, but just for the game.  Today was another good day.   I ran for a while after school, then went to practice.  I also got my schedule changed today.  So now its German, Trig A, Chem, Lunch, Gym, Sports & Entertainment Marketing, English, Geomotry.  That makes me think of a story.... so Kerry is sitting there, all of the sudden she turns to me and is like Doesn't Mr Rutter look like Dory?  So  I look, and there staring back at me is DORY.  Yes, thats right my geomtry teacher looks like Dory.  I've had such a good week, and I have so much energy, that the very same teacher (Dory/ Rutter) asks me if I'm on drugs.  Every day.  I'm super hyper by 8th hour.  For the record, I am not on drugs.  Of any sort.  I'd like to make that clear though. This quote is for a specific person, maybe they will know who they are.   QOTD-Let your heart guide you. It whispers, so listen closely. - Land Befoe Time  Passage of the Day-Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city.

      Tonite is Sunday. I guess that is ok, seeing as we don't have school tomorrow.  Lets see....Thursday exams ended. Lunch with Anna and Jennee.  Mrs.  Pieper was so funny.  Jennee was telling us a story from homecoming, and Mrs. Pieper was like, "Just because a boy picks you up and takes you to some half deccent resturant, does not mean you owe him a single thing girls." It was funny.  Friday no school, bad, bad roads, game, up north. Snowmobiling with my dad at 2 AM always provides good times... Saturday we snowmobiled, then ate, then napped, then ate, then snowmobiled, then slept. O my gosh, I had the WEIRDEST dreams on Saturday.  I shall tell you of one of them.  So, Jennee and I are doing Winter Formal Decorations, and thats been sorta time consuming lately.  So I'm sleeping and I dream that this HUGE roll of vinyl Jennee and I ordered was delivered to the cabin, because they wanted to find me and I wasn't at school.  So I cut the vinyl to fit the walls and the tables and such, then Jennee comes in and shes like, "BUT ITS THE WRONG COLOR!" so we FREAK.  Good thing this really didn't happen. Today we ate, cleaned, snowmobilied, napped on the way home.  Came home, made phone calls, wound up at Dekeyser's.  I seem to end up there a lot lately. Drove home, yadda yadda. And so I get home, ccall some more people, then I check the mail.  FIrst there is a letter about our Co-Cirricular meeting tomorrow...we have to decide what gets cut.  Then  there was a college brochure.  That freaked me out.  I guess it freaked me out, because it means I have to decide what to do with the rest of my life very soon.  Where to go, and what to do. YIKES!! I can't even pick out classes for next year....So tomorrow I am going to get Jennee so we can do Winter Formal Decorations, then there is practice, then my Co-Cirricular meeting.  Then Tuesday, Second semester begins.  I will rejoice.  Now, I must go start my Junior Staff application, or it will never get done.  QOTD:The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it. Carl Jung  POTD:If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 1 John 4:20  (NIV)

      Just another manic Wednesday?  Well, I guess you could call it that.  However, that isn't how the song goes.  It really goes: Just another manic Monday, wish it were Sunday, cuz that's my fun day...."  But who really has fun on Sunday?  Monday is just peaking around the corner then.  O well, I wish it was Tomorrow!  So here's what I've been up to. Monday I reviewed in all my classes....Boring.  No practice, only day all season!  Tuesday exams began...blah blah, Jennee and I got more WF stuff done.   Today same deal. Exams...Winter Formal....Money,...jennee.  It ended today...o how sad.  However, tonight,  The Apprentice was on.  Katie, Alex and I watched it.  Oh, JOY! It was good....they finally got rid of Sam.  Now the West Wing is on.  I love that show.  I am a political junkie.  What a dork.  O well. Last night, I was watching State of the Union. And then, I got so nervous about exams, the ones today,..the ones I have taken...I COULDN'T ENJOY BUSH BASHING!!! You know its bad when I can't even concentrate long enough to slauder Bush.   O well, I have survived...I think.   Quote of the Day " How far you go in life depends on you being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong. Because someday in life you will have been all of these."  -George Washington Carver  Passage of the Day �Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not just for people� Colossians 3: 23  Think about that for a while Christine Elizabeth.

      Today is Sunday.  Isn't that sad?  School tomorrow.  Then exams begin.  Yikes! So Friday, we had a game, we won 83-47.  Then I went to dinner with Jones, Klam and Knitter.  We had a good time.  Knitter thinks I am the queen of the Ghetto.  Yes, that is me... Saturday I had a forensics meet, and I even saw a couple of camp people....then I came home and called my Phlegm.   Then Jennee and I did some Winter Formal Shopping.  Then Phlegm appeared at my doorstep.  She came in, we talked, she made me a sweet book.  It was so sweet I began to cry.  Then we went to church.  Professer Brug went off on a tangent on the evils of Welch,  as in Welch's grape juice...odd man.... Then we went to Olive Garden.  I think in Heaven, the food is going to be Italian. We had a crazy waiter, and Steph and I had good food.  We saw this lady, she was crazy, whenever she saw something she wanted she would be like OOOHHHH.  It was good.  We came home, watched Maid in Manhatten, then slept.  We woke up, talked and then I drove her home... I miss her.  I'm very very sad, and in need of some camp....well, now I must return to SM things...and exams...yuck.  Yuck. YUCK!  qotd: Keep a good heart. That's the most important thing in life. It's  not how much money you make or what you can acquire. The art of it is to  keep a good heart.  Joni Mitchell  Passage of the day: No eye has seen no ear has heard and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.  I Corintians 2:9  Love always Chrissy.

      Wow, has been a while, so I shall update you now.  Sunday was church, and naps, lots of naps.  Thats all I really remember....Monday was school, then practice then co-cirricular meeting...then tuesday was school, track meeting, game.   So heres so details. See, Saturday I slept at Katie's, meaning I was tired Sunday.  Hence the sleeping.  I also went to the cheerleading competition to see my big sister Katie (#2 silly, #1 is NOT a cheerleader!) Yesterday's Game..We won, yay us....lol.....sure.   There are alot of things I could say about that game...you can ask for other details. Today Morgan was gonna give me a ride home, then the car didn't start, then we got out Tony's jumper cables, but those were broken, so her mom came, hers worked, so we came home.     Yea, I haven't been up to much. So now I shall return to my Munch 'ems and Jeopardy.  This week's issue of Time is excellent.  Also, Steph  I agree with you.  Love lots.   Christine Elizabeth. QOTD: Things are only impossible until they're not.    Jean-Luc Picard Trust in Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding   -Proverbs 3:5

      So today is Saturday.  Yay for the weekend.  Here's what I've been up to, just in case you do care.  Thursday I found out I have pneumonia, and went to basketball, etc. Nothing interesting, although an excellent day!  Yesterday was Friday, I had an awesome day, one of the best in a really long time....then we had a game in Burlington, we won, then we watched varsity, it was fun.  Danielle, Sarah, McMuffin and I had a good time eating pretzels and discussing Danielle's twin.  Then we went into the gym, sorta fun, Katie pushed me down the bleachers...thanks.  Jen asked me if my real name was Crysanthumum...and then I slept the whole way home.  Today I slept till 11, but now I'm goin to the Rocket Invite, so I'll see y'all later! QOTD: Tomorrow is today's dream. POTD: Proverbs 3:5 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding."

      Hello yet again from the frozen Wisconsin Tundra.  How I hate it. O well, life shall go on.   So here's what I've been up to since Monday.  Monday after I posted,  Steph and I talked about when we were old...And how we would sit at camp David, with our very own happy birthday grandMa shirts.... and how if our husbands die, and there is no one there to love us, we would simply love each other in our control top pantyhose and elastic jeans.  Aww Steph.  How I adore the funny convos.  By the way, I think you  have the longest name ever.  Stephanie Anastasia Pflughoeft, quite the mouthful!  Tuesday was a good day.   Didn't do much in school, just went from class to class, and over and over again.  Twas the same as ever.  Then we had a game.  Twas fun, I played a little, had a girl fall over my head...Yet all in all, a good game.  Varsity also won, so it was all fun.  Knitter came back from Hawaii and gave us all Leis. How fun!  Today was Wed.  I can't think of a funny story, not many at all.  Had a forensics meeting after school ( I gotta memorize that!) Bball practice,  then a school board meeting.  All in all, not an interesting 2 days, but not a bad 2 days.   Now I am watching the Mole, which happens to be my favorite show.  quote of the day: Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings.  William Arthur Ward  Passage of the day: Ps 28:7  "The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.  My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him."   Love Chrissy**

      Hello!! Vacation is over.  This saddens me.  Yet I had such a good time.  To finish off, Sunday I did not watch the Packer game.  Ugly guys in tight pants isn't very me.  Instead I went to see Mona Lisa Smile.  That movie was, unlike the packers, more suited to my tastes.  It was a good time, Anna and I adored fashions, Sarah and I complained about the endings.  We saw a mysterious out of order seat, and worried its reason.  Overall, I adored the movie, mostly cuz I love those actresses, and I am all about the sappy romance stories.   I cannot wait to own it Then I came home, and the vacation bubble ended.  I had to do homework, compteplated my speech about why we shouldn't kill Saddam, tried to take a poll, but the results were not in my favor.   Steph came back from camp, making me miss it 100000000000 times over.... cannot wait to go back! I told her my freaky camp dream, and then I thought about camp, and the week I was up there, and how much happened...wow. I was reading something in someone else's profile, thought how true it was. "The stars shine brighter when you're up there, because you're closer to God." Puts a smile on my face, thinking about Camp. today was back to school.  German play tomorrow, Trig test back, did decent, health speaker, chem quiz *how harsh!!* speeches, and rectangles to round out the day.   Came home and went through a huge box of Senate Christmas lites.  Then basketball.  Then cocirricular meetings, where we discussed ways to eliminate/reduce/ get money for sports and the like. I took Briggy home, and on the way home, I was listening to the radio, and I began to think about the perfect guy.  Twas an interesting thought.  Then I thought of my projects for the coming weeks.  I know, a random person. All in all, this vacation was high on my list.  Mayhaps a 9.   Quote: All who wander are not aimless.- Mona Lisa Smile Passage: Job 5:9-11 "He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.  He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside. The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety. Think about that.  Can't you just picture it?  Much love, *Christine Elizabeth*

      So, today is the last Saturday of the vacation.  Man, that sucks!  O well, I can honestly say that it was a n awesome break.  I had so much fun.    Today, I had early practice, after which we went to Coach Galweski's, we had breakfast and watched a tape of a game.  It was actually sorta fun....then  I went with Anna to the art museum, I love that place! After that, we went to her house and watched a very awful movie.  Don't watch The In Laws.  Trust me, I'm doing you  a favor!  I hung out with Nicole last nite, twas a good time, b4 practice jennee and I went Winter Formal shopping.  Yay for fake snow!!

      If I'd've known the way that this would end  If I'd've read the last page first  If I'd've had the strength to walk away  If I'd've known how this would hurt I'd do it all the same  Not a second I would change     -Trisha Yearwood  This is kinda how I feel about '03.  If I knew what some decisions would have brought about, maybe I wouldn't have chosen what I did.  But I think that I made the right choices in the end.   As Nicole once told me "If I had the choice to not do it all or do it and know it would end like this, I still would have done it."  So true.  Thats true about a lot in '03...more than anyone realizes.

      Happy 2004!!! Isn't it grand? 2003 was awesome, but  2004...now THAT'S gonna be an awesome year!  2003 had the good with the bad, the sad with the happy, the beautiful with the ugly, and everything in between.   I made friends, lost friends, and learned a lot more than I think I'll ever realize.   It started with an awesome party at Lauren's.  Then Lauren moved away.... I miss her.   I took a couple trips up to camp, met Steph, lots of other cool people.  Played some tennis, ran some track, finished it with some bball.  There are tons of other good times, from kickball and sand volleyball, to Livewire and swimming at Shelly's. KFC, and just hanging out. Had some bad classes(health).  Had some good classes (6th Hr. Freshman English anyone?) I love 2003.  May God bless you on this New Year! So, this post is just a little wrap of '03. I'll tell ya a little about my New Year's Eve a little later, now I must move on.

      Last Night was one of the best nights in a long time. First I went to Danielle's, dropped some stuff off, and said a quick hello to Lauren, then me dani briggy and lauren went to see Miricle.   Now, we were SUPER loud during the whole movie, i feel bad for everyone else in the movie, im surprsied we didn't get kicked out.  We had a constant popcorn fight, we went through like 3 of those big tub things you get refills on, and then there were just some classic moments.  Remember, Lauren now lives in MN, where the movie takes place. Lauren: man, we have a WOWC where I live. Me:  Um, Lauren, that IS where you live Lauren:  Oohhh, that explains a lot.  For being a red head, she's still the blondest person I know! THere was a russian named Krutov in the movie, I thought he was GREAT!   So, I decided it would be cool to be named Cruton.  Now think about that, Chrissy Cruton.  You can't get a cooler name than that!  After the whole movie ordeal we stopped at a gas station and Brigs and I got huge cappuchinos, and we returned to Dani's.  Briggy and I talked to Tim and his mom for a while, it was all great fun...then Briggy and i found the rubber band gun.  Rabbit hunting anyone?  O man good times  Today we made shirts for bball!  Yay! It was fun,  I love those girls. Well hope you all have a good week.   Love Chrissy!

      Another great week!  So Thursday was our last practice, it was fun, yet sad...   Then heres a crazy story for ya.  So I'm driving home from practice, it's about 8:30, and I'm on my street, and I see the police car.  There's been this green car parked in front of my house for like a week, and there's this police car behind it.  So I pull into my driveway and come inside and ask why there's a police car parked in front of my house.  Turns out, the car had been a stolen car.  So for like a week, there's been a stolen car in front of my house.  Crazy man, crazy! Yesterday was our last game, some girl from Park like tried to fight me, our game was sad...even Coach cried.  It's sad its over! Today i went to my brother's game, then to lunch.  I also went to the library.  GUESS WHO WAS THERE!?!?!?!  "The moon's out early tonight!? This kid will give you a ride!"  So good!! He recognized me, we talked for a while, yea, I still felt stupid.  It was funny though.  I also started my college binder..yea that's so um fun.....  Love lots,  Chrissy

      Hello Again-  I think I am going to die.  I'm sick, I can't breathe, and things are spinning.  O man its weird.   So other than the fact that I should be writing a will, I had a perfectly pleasant day.  I think something funny happened in almost every class, except of course chem, because nothing ever happens in chem.   However, I think Lauren takes the cake for today's comment.  We're sitting on the floor in English, watching To Kill a Mockingbird, and Klammy, lauren and I are talkin about where we'd like to live.   Klammy: Chrissy I could see you living in the South. Lauren: No, Chrissy, I think you belong in washington. Me: Washington state, or washington dc? Lauren:  Which one is the White House in? O my, i almost died of laughter.  I lost my agenda, but I refound it so all is good.  Steph I finally got you a card, i swear it will be coming soon, and you will laugh.  I have a present for you, but I don't believe I shall see you until March 12, which is entirely to far!  last nite bball practice was fun, sorta sad.  Today is the last practice, and tomorrow its over...its sad, you get to know people really well when you spend  2 hours a day with them, sometimes more....I'm gonna miss it, but track is comin!  Got formal pics back, some are cute, some are not.  Ask if you want to see them or steal doubles!  My sister took one for her dorm room, which makes me sad, it reminds me she won't be here in a few months...   O man, I've had camp's theme stuck in my head...I  was lost and confused....   POTD- Their teaching will spread like gangrene.  (LOOK, a little Word, a little vocab!) QOTD   When you give away a little piece of your heart, you're giving away the only thing you can give away, which, after you do, you got more left than you had before you gave some of it away. Don Hutson                Love lots! ~*~*~Christine Elizabeth~*~*~

      Hello y'all.  I'm to young for this.  13 letters from colleges TODAY ALONE!  I don't know what to wear tomorrow, let alone what to do with my life.  URGH!    Yesterday we had a game, we lost, it was sad, we only lost by 3.  Afterwards I wore an assortment of random clothes left in my sports locker, which meant boxers, socks, and someone's cross sweatshirt.  Yea, there were a lot of people there to.  I looked like a million bucks, let me tell ya. Then shelly and amyx came over, it was fun.  We had a good time, talkin and laughing.  Amyx took up like the whole couch though, so Shelly and I made bed angels.  Good times.  Today we went to mayfair shopping.  We ran into my fellow ghettoian, Knitter.   It was fun, we got some good deals, it was sorta crowded though.  Why do they sell some of the stuff they do?  I don't know the answer to that question.  I came home, went to church, then came home and went to Scottie's.    Now I am looking through college mail while Beth plans the rest of my life.  How kind of her.  Wow.  Today the camp brochure came in the mail.  I guess when you've been going to a place for a certain amount of time, you expect something, and wow.  The brochures have changed since I was in 2nd grade.  They used to be like a piece of paper with one picture, now they are nice paper with color and stuff.  Cute, and I knew like everyone in it.  It made me think.  hard.    Adversity not only draws people together but brings forth that beautiful inward friendship, just as the cold winter forms ice-figures on the window panes which the warmth of the sun effaces.  Soren Kierkegaard  " From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." Luke 12:48

      O man.  Life is crazy this week.  Some in a good, some in a bad.  I think a lot of people have had personal problems this week, and I just want to let y'all know I love you!   But in a good crazy,I think everything is flying by so fast.  Some days, i just wanna hit the rewind button.  Can I go back to like 6th grade and just play it all over again?  Or maybe just high school.  I mean, basketball flew by,  it was so much fun though.  And today we went to the game as a team it was fun.  We got on the big screen and stuff.  Took lots of pictures.  O man, we're making the boys JV team shirts, and i'm makin jim merlin's! O MAN! im so excited.  lol. how i adore jim merlin.  I want WF pictures just for the one of me and Jim.  Today was an excellent day.  Other than I hate swimming in gym.  O well. Life goes on.    Sometimes I'm so stupid.  LoL.  O well, you should still love me.    If you need anything, always realize I'm here for you.  Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes always perseveres.  -I Cor. 13:4-7

      LOL.  Such a blonde day today.  But a good one.  Today Anna asked me :  "Chrissy,can you spell the word Kyoto from the word Tokyo?"  I, being blonde, looked at her like she was crazy and said "No, of course not,  there is no K in Tokyo ."  Wow.  I get a ten for that one!  So I'm not the brightest crayon in the box today.   Just thought I'd share!

      Wow.  Remember how I didn't want to go to formal?  At all?  Well actually, it was the best nite in a super long time.  And the best dance so far! So here's a quick rundown of my really good weekend.  Friday we had a game at Bradford.  We won ( I even scored!) Then we watched varsity.  It was fun, we threw random food at people's heads, and just had a good time in general.      Danielle has these mittens, and they have some sort of animal on them, i think they are supposed to be bears.  Katie attacked me with them, and I was like what ARE those?  She goes hippos, or maybe dogs...wow good times.  Saturday morning we decorated.  Jennee looked like Scary Spice, but our decorations went well with only a few minor setbacks... then that afternoon Katie and I drove downtown, that was an adventure to say the least.  Saturday night was super fun.  First we took pictures, then dinner.  Jennee stole utensils, Andy talked to his pasta, we laughed at how we ate.  Then we went to the dance, it was super fun.  Some highligts included: Interpretive dancing, Mal and I advoiding certain people, just talking to everyone, Matt's dancing o man, good times. Thanks for dragging me.  Then we went back to Katie's and slept.   This morning I went to church, then babysat all day.  That's about all I did this weekend.  Good times though.  "  The life you have led doesn't need to be the only life you have."   Anna Quindlien  Humility and the fear of the LORD bring wealth and honor and life. Proverbs 22:4

        I just want to go to camp.     Life is a funny thing.  It truly is..One night you can be in the best mood ever.  Then, the next day is just bad....but someone will always come to make it better.  But there always people there, who love you no matter what.  I'm more thankful for them than ANYTHING right now.  I love you guys to pieces.  It means so much to me, even if it was just asking whats wrong. I really am sorry for complaining and being grouchy today.  I promise to be better tomorrow!  I was thinking, and I have decided I just need to work harder.  So that's what I'm going to do.  Just work harder at everything.  I'm so thankful I can pray to God.    If you got winter sports pictures, please let me have one.  I got some, I will give you one....But they are pretty ugly...  My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.

      O man, its been a weird couple of days.  They are very very very good days, however no running.  Its tough, because I've worked so hard all winter, and all of this season, and now I lost it all.   I know its for a good reason, but its  tough  to deal with.   Shelly brought me livewire.  Everything is better in orange we decided.  Yes, they brought it back, it was like all I drank last summer.   I'm so excited.  However,  I'm so excited for summer.   It kinda works like this: - HOBY leadership, June 4-6 -Exams June 8-10 JR STAFF TRAINING!!!!- June 13-18 (maybe staying till the 20th) Summerfest- June 27-July 4?  Maybe, IDK July 4-10- Hopefully volunteering week at camp July 7ish- 3 quarter birthday party for Anna and I July 17-23- Branson Vacation July 24- August 7- Hopefully debate camp August 14- Tennis!!  In between all this, misc.   Hanging out, LIVEWIRE, swimming, and getting a tan!  O, and working.

I know what part of methat heaven's looking at, I know that feelin' when I knock that other part flat My selfish heart still likes to sin-'sgonna like it 'till I die, But I know my Savior saved me, from me myself and I.  There's a part of me that's biuried. THere'sa part of me that lives. THere's a part of me that says "eat, drink, be merry, 'Cause Jesus will forgive." There's a part of me that says, "No WAY! I ain't tramplin' on my Savior's blood" There's a part of me that's clean today, Been washed in the scarlet flood.

      Saddest Thing: MTV's new show, I want a Famous face.   I realize MTV wants people to watch, but this is the worst way ever.  To lead people to think that their lives will magically get better if they look like Brad Pitt or whoever.  Well, there's a reason you look the way you look, and maybe you should just deal with it.  In the end, is it really going to matter?  Anyone who TRULY cares about you isn't going to care if you look like J-Lo, or if you are ugly.  This is just a way for MTV to show teenagers there are quick fixes out of your problems... But there aren't.  Just because you look like someone famous doesn't mean it changes anything in your life...This show bothers me simply because there IS NO QUICK FIX to all your problems.  Suck it up, and deal with it.

      I had a spectacularly marvelous week.   It was so fun, between everything that happened. A few quick highlights-  Klam meeeting "Mr. Right"  haha i laughed for like an hour, how come no one else thought it was funny?  Steph informing me that she can by something at the dollar for *gasp* a dollar!  Gunnar and I attempting to dance, really just running circles with an occasional skip....

      I haven't written in here for a while.  Not much has happened, Saturday was Nicole's sweet 16 party, twas fun.  Today was a really funny day.  So its after school and Jennee and I felt like running outside, so we get all ready.  We go outside, and its pouring.  So we decide, eh not that bad, we'll just run through it.   Well we get down the hill, and out of the driveway, and it starts pouring.  We couldn't see.  Then the lightning and thunder start.  So now we're out of the parking lot, on the far exit, and its dark and torrental downpours....so we decicde to just run to the other driveway, and so we do.  But there's snow, rain, mud, puddles everywhere.  Jennee and I finally make it up to school, and the door is "locked".  Actually, it wasn't locked, but Scottie and Jimmy were holding it.  So Jennee and I went inside completely soaked, and everyone looked at us like we're crazy.  Which we are.  And a lot blonde.  O well.  A couple of quick countdowns before trig and  chem.  Girls Lunch- 3 days Girls Night- 4 days Camp Retreat-11 days Spring Break-38 days School days-i get 59! training- 105 days!

      Do you ever have a day, where you feel like NOTHING was bad?  Today was one of those days.  :-).  Ok, minus the throwing up.   But even that was good,  it made me feel better.  Anywho, today was  a good day.  I'm SO excited for Sports Marketing.  We don't have an exam, instead we have to make a marketing plan.   Its gonna take ALOT of work but im excited.   First you pick a sport.  I of course, picked tennis.  Then you make a schedule, list the coaches and give a desription.  Then you write a summary of the previous season.  Then you make an overvew.  Then you ahve to make ticket pricing.  After that, you determine the 2 target groups to market to.   Followed by Single Game Ticket Strategies, and then season long promotionals. Game by game breakdowns....pre game, themes, who they are playing, who's singing the national amthem, who's sponsoring, promotions, halftime, broadcasts, telecasts post games and mascots.  Price Promotions come next, such as kids get half off. Also, a ten minute presentation has to be created, such as a power point and handouts, name a sports marketing firm, write a sponsorship.  We could do groups, but I'm doing it alone.  So, throw in an election speech, 2 conferences, a whole bunch of track meets and practices, a sports marketing plan, homework, planning and putting on a debate dinner for 30 people, work starts this month, lifegaurding course, and you have my life.  I LOVE IT.  haha, life is just awesome when you are so busy you can't think.   HAHA, how funny were those surveys todaY?  OK, so today in homeroom we had to fill out these matchmaking surveys, where you can purchase results to see your perferct match.  I put my dream guy has purple hair and is under 5 feet tall.  So maybe that's why I haven't found Mr. Right... I Love you all, God Bless, Follow Him! Live, Laugh, Love and Dream Large,  *~*~Chrissy!~*~*

      Today was fun.  Well actually, today wasn't, tonight was. I realized something, sitting there with anna and jennee.  A year ago, ecen 3 months ago, you couldn't have said I'd be such good friends with them, I wouldn't have believed it....but tonight I realized something.  The biggest lesson learned this year:  Ya gotta love people for what they are. You can't change them.  They won't always be what you want or expect, you might not agree on EVERYTHING but they still deserve a chance.   They'll always be there, and that's what counts.  A true friend...loves you like you are.  Thanks for that ladies!  Anna, Independant women, you make me feel wonderful for everything...A washington hug!  LOL is that what they do in china?  Jennee: I'll love you no matter what, more than he ever could.   Shelly: I'm excited for tomorrow.  Steph: WHERE ARE YA?  I miss ya.

      So, its SPRING BREAK!!! Loving it, loving it.  Off to an AWESOME start.  Thursday I got to say goodbye to my lovely, adorable, Sarah, as she's off to Costa Rica.  Absolutely hilarious...the pin, take a picture swimming, the mag, o man, I love that girl.  Friday I had track, then I went to church, Good Friday.  Came home, played some tennis, and then went out with Anna and Jennee.  I love those girls.   We had so much fun, driving around, mean Ferch's ppl, Barnes and Noble, Culvers was so fun.   LoL, I wanted to see!!! Anna leaving the door open, just constant laughs, with the straws, everything.  We always have so much fun.  Today I babysat, for a real long time, real early in the morning.  Now I'm going to the Bucks game, 6th row tickets, I'm excited.  Have a blessed Easter.

      Awww Hope House tonight.  Cutest kids EVER.  So adorable, we gave them Easter.  I love that feeling, like your doing something right.  And for just a few hours, you don't have to worry about boys, or friends, or grades or sports...just these cute kids, and they make you realize that all those trivial problems that you have, don't COMPARE to these kids.  John may take me paintballing...I'm REALLY excited!!  Some people....man I tell ya.  No consideration, completely self absorbed, just UGH!!!   Sometimes I wonder.  Where is my life going?  Why does it seem at times, that I work so hard, and get NOTHING out of it?  I work so hard, what do I get?  Some letters on a piece of paper, an injury that sets me back almost a month?   I love God, I know he does everything for MY good, I just want to know what it is.  What am I supposed to be doing, where is this life going?   Good sermon this morning by Profesor Sigglecow.  It was about self-esteem, and selfish love.  My favorite part.  "The world sees love as, this person can make me happy.  The Christian sees love as, I love you, because I can give YOU something,  I can bring you joy."  I love music.  Where would this world be without music?  Last night, so fun, girls I love you.  You guys are so fun.  Sarah was classic, left?  And us screaming, and the laugh, many good times, and your dance recital was, well... you did a nice job!!  Nicole and I played tennis today, was fun, she's a natural.  LOL

      I haven't updated this in a long time.  For that, I am very sorry! So now, I'll let you know what I've been up to. Last weekend. Friday- Anything Goes Assembly, I made a fool out of myself (I'm the WORST hula hooper ever!)  Then it was off to powderpuff, which got cancelled, due to the rain that was on its way...so I went to Brennan's with Shelly and Anna.  Good times...we watched Runaway Jury, it was good.  Saturday I worked for a few hours, blegh, but money is good.  Then Shelly and I went to buy white t-shirts.  She sprayed me with Mary-Kate and Ashley prefume, it stunk, and she told me  to get gum, because I needed romance in my life.  I then drove the truck to church, and it was off to Kingston's.   Fun times, we made our shirts, hung out.    Sunday we woke up, really early because the power was out.  Then we went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it was EXCELLENT.  By far the best out of the three movies.  HAHA, yes, I've already seen it!  Then I came home and got grounded. It was for something stupid, so lets just not go there...  This week was our last full week of school. New Senate announced...don't get me started.   But I am decorations chair for homecoming, with Abby, and I am SO excited!!!   MARVELOUS DAY YESTERDAY.  For the following reasons: 1) It was Friday. 2) Last Friday of the year (for me, I get out of school this Friday!)  3) Did really well on all my tests and quizzes, and there were a ton 4) Played Kickball in Gym, because we didn't want to run to the tennis courts, and Kickball is so fun! 5) Volunteered @ Hope House, kids are still really cute. When we came back from Hope House, we walked around the new stadium, and played Frisbee in the parking lot.  The new stadium is really cool, and big.  We were standing on the field, looking at the stars.  It made miss camp, really much.  But two weeks!!!! from tomorrow, and I'll be up there.  My excitement is growing.   Had a few odd dreams last night....  Today I slept in, then woke up and scrapbooked. Now I must go to work, see y'all later!  That reminds me, I'm out of town the whole month of June now.  And the first, third and last week in July.  And the 2nd week in August.  And then tennis. I Love Summer.

      Just thought this was funny..  BERLIN, Germany (Reuters)  -- A German inventor who developed a gadget that berates men if they try to use the toilet standing up has sold more than 1.6 million devices, his business manager said on Tuesday.  German women fed up with a man with a poor aim can turn to the ghost-shaped gadget, which lurks under the toilet rim and, if the seat is lifted, declares in a stern female tone:  "Hello, what are you up to then? Put the seat back down right away, you are definitely not to pee standing up ... you will make a right mess..."  Alex Benkhardt, 46, invented the "WC Ghost" and its creators are in negotiations to market it in Britain, Canada and Italy.

And track ends tomorrow.  Which means we have like 2 weeks. I love it...love it looove it.  Oh, oh I am a crocodile., I should be in the nile He stuck me in this boat with him Doesn't he know that I can swim? For I am a crocodile.  So I'm swimming with my family And this bearded guy came up to me though all that I wanted was to swim The stranger made me come with him.  Well, I'm caged up with two kangaroos Two elephants and some cockatoos The hyenas, they just laugh at me the wildebeests make me hungry.  Well, the bearded guy came down today I didn't understand what he had to say He was raving 'bout some olive branch He took his wife and they started to dance.  Today I'm finally on the land I saw them sacrifice a lamb A colorful band was in the sky and we praised the Lord that the land was dry.  I CAN'T WAIT for step aerobics...with steph and chrissy.

      Good, excellent, wonderful,marvelous weekend so far.   Friday, good day, none of my teachers were there/made us do anything.  German we watched Marco and Sabine.  Trig was a joke, it was so crazy in there.  Chem was in the library cuz  Albrecht wasn't there.  Lunch(more library), putting in the balcony for gym.   Sports Marekting-third hour in the library that day- English we read Rolling Stone,  Geomtry was the easiest test I have ever taken, since we had a notecard of formulas, so you just plugged numbers in.    O yea, Election Assembly.  I think it went alright, I was so nervous....I'm ready for results...whatever they are, its a win-win situation.  Even if I lose, one of my best friends wins, so what more can I ask?  Saturday,  track community service, sawing stumps etc.  Fun times....then Druckrey's for lunch.,..WLC graduation with Steph.  Somehow, we wound up asking a guy at the gas station what to do...he said the lake...and we wound up at my house?!?  What?  So then we got Steph directions home, I felt bad, because we drove like 40 gazillion miles out of her way, and gas is so expensive.  I'm SORRRY STEPH!!!!! Then I went to Shelly's, it was a good time...all the sudden her little sister comes running into the house, screaming :"MOM....DO YOU KNoW WHAT THEY TEACH YOU IN 4TH GRADE?!?!/"  Utterly appalled she goes..."They teach you about private body parts" and runs back out of the house, with a look of terror on her face...ahh jenny, so funny. Went home, ate.Then Katie picked me up.  We rented Honey.  It was alright.  Came home early cuz I was tired, and my sister is attempting to cook.  Help us all... so I had to help make her spaghetti, and didn't get to bed until late anyways.  This morning was Church.   Then put pictures in order.  Now, I am going to eat, drop Katie off at work, pick up Shelly, and go shopping.  Dinner downtown, then FAME!! how excited am I?  I am utterly ambitious today.....It's sorta Scary.

      SUCH a fun day.   It started with me watching Dawson's Creek (as every summer day should, and does, start).   Then  I took a shower, and read my mail.   Not at the same time...I took the shower first, THEN walked to the mailbox, but before I went to the mailbox and after the shower I got dressed, it would be indeccent if I didn't...    In the mail I reccieved 5 things.   4 more colleges telling me how I would fit in, be like Jane Addams, etc.   And a letter from Sarah, that she sent to camp, and they very kindly forwarded to me.   It made me laugh, especially the pictures.  How come I look CRAZY in every picture that I'm not posing for?  O well,  may it is because I am...  Then it was DECA officers lunch.   Good times, Meghan, Anna and I are pink obsessed DECA officers...it'll be a fun year.   We were very productive, all well enjoying Cafe Zarletti's, the cute boy, and other things.   Good times included me throwing my pen (IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, I SWEAR!), is he wearing a ring?  Meghan is checking out the 12 year old, switching food, and pick up lines.   Despite the laughing, we were able to accomplish a lot.  I came home, and then Brennan and I decided to hang out.   We were going to walk in the park, but Anna didn't want to, so we went to Brennan's and watched a movie.   Good times.... Anna, do you take vitamins?   Like Motrin? Your mouth seemed very tasty...etc.  Then I came home, had yet another disasterous family dinner.   I really don't fit into my family, and every dinner I'm forced to eat with them ends in my tears, and everyone hating me....yea, good times.  Then Anna, Shelly and Brennan came over.   We talked, it was good times.   We discussed lots of debate issues, we're such dorks.  I think the highlight was when Mrs. Pieper picked up Anna.   Brennan had been drawing this dress for me, made of yellow post its, and she was like "Id never let my daughter out of the house in something so easy to get out of...I mean think of how quickly a boy could rip off that post it. "    Now, I'm sitting here reading old IMs.   From MSN.  They crack me up.   Ryan and I had a 20 minute conversation about jelly beans once, and everything Matt and I talk about just cracks me up.  The time he tried to help me get out of my vacation was hilarious.   Last night Matt and I discussed what would happen if we got into a fight.   Remember, we are probably the 2 clumsiest people alive...

      A fun 3 days, since after camp.     Sunday I saw Jersey Girl with Brennan and J-Mo.  It was cute.   This guy in the theater (granted there were only 7 of us there) had the funniest laugh.   Seriously, it was great.  Monday I just hung out here, then wound up going to J-Mo's and watching her little sister.  Then we went shopping.   Good times.  POKE.  I got a couple of cute things for next week.  Today J-Mo, Brennan, and Anna came over, and we had lunch.   It was very fun, we had a good time.   It's the first time we've hung out since school got out!  That's crazy!   Then we went to the beach.   We didn't swim, due to the billions of gallons of waste in the water....but we tanned and walked and stuff.   Again, more funny times.   I HATE it when people don't say goodbye before they leave.   :-(

      Y'all I have to apologize.   For those of you who care (or just get so boerd that you read it) I'm sorry i didn't update in such a long time.  I've been doing nothing but flying around for the past 2 weeks, getting things in order, all around the state, back and forth doing this that and the other thing...I'm out of breath just thinking about it!  HOBY was fun.  Met some nice people (and my room mate didn't smell!! yay!)  Y'all would not believe how nice these guys were.   they would like hold the door for you, and everyone up there would talk to you, and so nice....so different than here...  So now I have ONE exam left, just gym (LOL) so i went out to lunch today with Anna, Brennan and Jennee.  Whenever we take Brennen with us, people always make comments that he's a guy with three girls...its sorta funny.   So I'm so blonde, its not even funny.    You have a bird living in your lamp?   Wait...so your first and last names are like the same?  Ok so it is sorta funny.     I also parallel parked today for the first time in 7 months.   Yay for me!  It was bad though....o well.   I'm an official DECA officer!  Vice president of Civic Consciousness  I got a card from my most favorite Stephanie Anastasia Pflughoeft!! It was the only thing laying out on my desk when I got home.  Reading it, I just got so gosh darn happy.   IM SO EXCITED FOR NEXT WEEK!  CAMP training.  Heck yea, it'll be good to see everyone again.   Matthew and Beth and steph and ryan and matt and carissa and dawn and everyone else I have not seen in a very long time.  My life isn't so interesting right now, so I think I'm going to clean my room and add more songs to the iPod  for this weekend.    Hey one last thing.  For the first time ever, after taking my exams, I'm not worried.  Usually i have these HUGE breakdowns, like what if I get a B??? and freak out.   But I'm not getting that.  Other than my sports marketing presentation wouldn't open, so I have to do it before our officer meeting friday morning.  Well I'm really off now, have a nce night!   Lots of love and laughter Chrissy

        Another week of summer.&nbsp; Another interesting one.    &nbsp;   Ok, so I left you Monday night with Shelly and I going to hang out.&nbsp; The ensuing incident was quite interesting, and resulted in our attempt of boycotting the Howell Ave. McDonalds.     &nbsp;So Shelly and I decide we want free ice cream, and I have that free sundae thing at McDonalds from having perfect 4th quarter attendance, so we decide to go to the McDonalds on Howell, because its nicer than the one in SM.&nbsp; we get there, and this kid starts banging on the window, and he's in like 7th grade, and we walk in, and he starts trying to hit on us, mind you he's a 7th grader....Then there's girls from OC who are like trying to start something because&nbsp;I have an SM sweatshirt on(keep in mind, this is me and shelly) and are like don't serve people from SM and all this. THEN&nbsp;(this is the real kicker)&nbsp;&nbsp;I use my free sundae card, all peachy keen, and hand it to shelly, and the guy won't let her use it, because&nbsp;&nbsp;it has my name on it.&nbsp; SO, I'm like fine, ill make another purchase, and use it again, but he won't let me, even it is reusable, unlimited sundaes.&nbsp; He tells me I can't make a second purchase, because I've already had my turn ordering food.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, maybe I'm still hungry...:(I mean, what is this?) So he's completely crazy, but he's a mangager, so there's no one else we can talk to.... And shelly and I do this all the time at this mcdonalds.... So we sit down, with one sundae... And the 7th graders keep trying to hit on us, and the girls keep talking about us......So we're like enough is enough, &nbsp;and we went to the other mcdonalds.  Where I carried my sundae in, and she used my card.&nbsp; It was all good in SM.     So that was Monday Night.     Tuesday I went to Adrienne's, and dropped off the Saved By the Bell tape, and we went to George Webb's for lunch, but we both ordered breakfast...I stopped by my mother's office, and continued on my way.&nbsp; After that my sister and I tried on our bridesmaid's dresses for our cousin's wedding in 2 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it was off to babysitting.&nbsp; All in all a good time.&nbsp; The little boy heard someone say nipple and he asked me to tell him what a nipple was, but I passed on that opportunity...Instead I allowed him to bury my arm in the sand.&nbsp; All the while the baby is sitting there playing with a truck.&nbsp; However, his TR's sound like F's....So the result was funny, considering he isn't 2 yet.     Wednesday was running, then going to tennis, then an hour of work.&nbsp; Then to the doctor.&nbsp; Yuck, I had my physical, X-Ray and Blood test.&nbsp; Yawn, I was in the doctor's office for over 2 hours.&nbsp; Then my mom and I went to see Music Man Jr.&nbsp; It was cute.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;we went to the new Quizno's and Starbucks.&nbsp; It was good     Today we ran for tennis, blergh, I need to run more.&nbsp; After that I came home and the Doctor called.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;a broken pinky, and quite a sexy splint to show for it...See what happened was.. I was mowing the grass on a&nbsp;bright and sunny day&nbsp;and all the sudden the sun was covered.&nbsp; See, there were these HuGE birds and they just attacked.&nbsp; I struggled, but one of them bit my pinky.&nbsp; Next thing I know, these guys come up and try to mug me, and man I fought the first 10 off but that 11th one, he got it, he really got my pinky.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, so that wasn't really what happened, but Asha, Kara and I thought it was a good story..     So the Doctor called, and then I went shopping with my sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a good time.&nbsp; Then we had dinner.&nbsp; I was supposed to hang out with the Shellster next, but then my mother came home, and informed me we were going out as a family for ice cream, as an " We're sorry about your broken finger" type thing.     &nbsp;   I really hate being home.&nbsp; Leaving next week, but not going far, I'll have my cellular telephone.&nbsp; Unless Beth doesn't call by 9:43 on Saturday night.

       So, this weekend was interesting.      Friday was just unpacking and sitting around. No big happenings, thats just the day I got home...      Saturday morning I woke up and went to the parade to see my sister. She waved, we looked. Then I went to Lion's Fest to work for Senate. WOund up working until almost 8, then Katie and Nicole showed up. We walked around but not for long, it was really boring. We met up with Jerre and then went to Dairy Queen. Then we picked up Gunnar and Jim and came here. We watched Ice Age (Jerre picked it). It was cute, I've never seen it.     Sunday I went to church real early. Then I was supposed to hang out with Sarah, but I couldn't. I WAS SO SAD. I had to go to my Grandma's, which was fun. Then I came home, and Amyx and I played tennis. Then I got home and had dinnner with my brother. Then Shelly called to say she was home. And I invited her over. Then Anna called to say she was home. And I invited her over. So the girls came over, and we never made it past the family room. We just sorta sat down, started talking and that was that. A few hours later, they left.      Today I babysat all day. The kids were good, we went to McDonald's to lunch. You should see the looks people give you when you take a baby in public. So 3 people asked me about " my children " bringing the total to  7  people who have thought these were my kids. By the way, the oldest one is NINE   . That would have made me SEVEN when I had her. SEVEN. OK, that doesn't even make sense.       Now I'm waiting till my sister returns, then hopefully stealing the car to hang out with Shelly.       I miss Steph. A lot. We'd better hang out this week before I do daycamp and she is at camp!

      Hmm.  I got to thinking today, and we know when that happens, only 2 results are possible...  1) It could be dangerous.  I could really screw something up.  2) I come up with a brilliant conclusion.  I hope this is one of those situations that number 2 applies to.   SO i was thinking,  if certain things hadn't happened in my life, how I would be differnt.  More specifically, if certain people werent' in my life, how I would different.    Its strange ya know, I got to thinking, how all these people, some who are seemingly insignficant may have changed my life completely...like if I hadn't met Steph last year volunteering, would I still adore camp?  Or if I didn't have a sister, who would I admire and confide in?  Or if Cindy hadn't come up to me the first day in band of freshman year, which lead to me NOT sitting with a certain other group at lunch, who would my friends be? So I could go on and on, about all of you, but really that would take forever.  Ya know that quote, "Some people come into our lives and quickly go, and others leave footprints on our herats and we are never ever the same?" I dont think that's true...I think that EVERYONE in our lives, even if they are just a fleeting presnce touches our lives...we have  many sets of footprints in our hearts, and those tracks, they're kinda like DNA of the mind, heart and soul.  They are what truely shapes and forms you...   So thank you, to all of you, who in the smallest ways, the greatest ways, and all ways in between have ever touched and changed my life.

      Happy day today.&nbsp; I got my Germany Trip info for next year!!! Yay! I'm so very excited, it seems so real when people start to demand money.&nbsp; So we leave from Chicago, fly into Paris, then we go through Lichtenstein to Austria...and into Munich.&nbsp; Then we take the overnite train into Berlin,&nbsp; and fly back to Chicago. HOLY cow, its gonna be a busy 10 days.&nbsp; But I love that overnight train...and Berlin, which I haven't been too since I was younger. And I'm SO excited for Paris, I've never been there...so basically, I have this overwhelming excitement, even though the trip isn't for 7 months....  I also realized that when my sister leaves next month, I'm going to be seriously depressed.&nbsp; I have NO idea what I'll do without her.....  &nbsp;

       I'm BACK!     &nbsp;   But once again, not for long. I love being gone.&nbsp; I've been home for 3 hours, and I'm ready to leave again .   &nbsp;   Vacation was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Branson was pretty, a little hot.&nbsp; I'm so very UN-graceful, more about that later... so we went to Springfield (Illinois) to start with.&nbsp; We saw lots of Lincoln sites, where he lived, where he was buried, where he found out he was president, where he went bankrupt.&nbsp; Also we saw the Museum of Funeral Customs...that was odd...    Then it was off to Branson.&nbsp; We went to an amusement park one day, just looked around branson and saw a few shows.&nbsp; Our campground was really pretty, up in the mountains.&nbsp; I ran through the campground one day, it was the hardest run ever.&nbsp; See the campground was in a mountain.&nbsp; That meant very big slopes for running.&nbsp; Throw 100 degree heat into the mix and wow.&nbsp; But it was a good run.&nbsp; That brings me to the UNgraceful story.&nbsp; I was walking down to the pool and I fell.&nbsp; In the gravel.&nbsp; Skinned my knees, and my hands and somehow scratched my forehead.&nbsp; And either sprained or broke or did something to my pinky.&nbsp;However, I didn't go to the doctor because I have a Doctor's appt this week.&nbsp; We'll see how that goes.&nbsp; Other than that, Branson was beautiful, mountains and such, we took a train ride, and it was hot.&nbsp; Like 90's/100's every day!    And there was this little 6 year old girl. Her name was Lauren. She just came up to us as we are tanning by the pool and talked to us.&nbsp; And talked.&nbsp; She talked non-stop for like 3 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was cute.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  But now I miss people.&nbsp; Like Steph, and Emily Waldorf, and Shelly, and J-Mo, and Anna, and Matt Werner, and Brennan, and Borck, and Evan (RON!), Nicole, and Dani and Sarah and Brig,and Ali&nbsp;German, and Emily K. and Hannah, Bethany and Renee&nbsp;and everyone else I could have missed...    Soon&nbsp;I will update my list of&nbsp; things to do before I die.

       OOOO new Blogger changes!&nbsp; I can change color and size, and make lists.&nbsp; That's so very exciting!!    &nbsp;  Ok, so on to new, different and exciting things in my life:     Thursday:&nbsp; Taught VBS again, twas again, a fun day.&nbsp; I love those little kids, it's so much fun to be around them!&nbsp; Then I got home, and recieved a letter from Hannah!&nbsp; Ahh, any day when you get mail, that is   a GLORIOUS day! Then I updated my calender (I know, I'm such a dork) and then went to work.&nbsp; Worked for 6 long and boring hours.&nbsp; Then it was off to by my mother's birthday present, which was at Barnes &amp; Noble.&nbsp; That drive is really sort of boring by yourself...I don't think I'll do that again.&nbsp;Then it was home (as it was almost 10 after all this) and I had MUCH to do.&nbsp; DECA stuff to work on and emails to send...went to bed around 11:30 with a list of 22 things left to do!    Friday (today): Started with VBS at 9, we stayed and had lunch and did Olympics with the kids.&nbsp; It was so very fun!&nbsp; We then had a balloon release, it was awesome, seeing like 150 balloons just fly away.&nbsp; After that, my daddy and I went to the Post Office.&nbsp; Yes it was exciting, I've never been in the SM one before! Then it was home to pack ( I can now pack for a week long trip in 5 minutes and 43 seconds, my dad and I timed it.&nbsp; I suppose that's what you get, as this is my fourth time I've had to this summer.&nbsp; Only one or two more, we'll see.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Anna, Brennan and I went for a bike ride.&nbsp; We got to Warnimount, and it started to hail and pour, so Anna's father picked us up.&nbsp; It was an enjoyable ride other than that.&nbsp; I came home, ran errands for the fam, got some KFC and we ate as a family.&nbsp; My mom, sister, adn I went to see  Little Shop of Horrors. &nbsp; It was really good!&nbsp; You would NOT believe who was there.&nbsp; Actually most of you won't care...but the ONLY kid we lost to at State this year, yes the dorky Greendale kid, it made me angry (yes, 6 months later..don't question me, debate is important!)We came home, had cake, and gave my mother her presents.&nbsp; Now I must go, finish packing stuff for the drive, and writing my sisters her daily letters (I'm leaving her a note for each day)       Ta ta! Love you all, and Have a great week!        Chrissy

      And about the Berlin TV tower( I've been there, it's in Chasing Liberty, and Shelly asked about it, but I haven't been there in like 5 years so I couldn't quite remember everything)  The history of the Television Tower of Berlin is directly connected with the historical situation of the division of Germany into two parts and the division of the city of Berlin. The former GDR saw the necessity to build a powerful transmitter in the middle of the eastern part of Berlin and in addition to this the Television Tower was meant to become an architectural and political symbol. It was in 1969 when SED leader Walter Ulbricht after long discussions decided not to build the Tower on the "Müggelbergen", a place in Berlin-Köpenick where the construction of a Tower had already begun, but on the Alerxanderplatz. In connection with the "Palast der Republik" a remarkable and representative monument was to be erected. It took only 53 month to build the "sozialistische Höhendominante" and on October 3, 1969 the Television Tower of Berlin was put into operation. After the reunion in 1990 the Tower did not loose its attraction. At the turn of the year 1995/96 the inside of the Television Tower was renovated and the technological standard was completely renewed. Now the visit of the television Tower of Berlin is even more pleasurable. Each year about 1.000000 people visit the Tower and enjoy the atmosphere and the great view from the top of it.

      A shorter answer:  Civilians often wonder why the US Army Flag Patch is reversed. The answer is: not all Army Flag Patches are reversed, but only those worn on the right shoulder. The reason has to do with proper display of the flag.  When flags are displayed on moving vehicles, the blue star field is always displayed towards the front of the vehicle. In this way, the flag appears to be blowing in the wind as the vehicle travels forward (flags are always attached to their flag poles on the blue field side). If the flag were not reversed on the right hand side of the vehicle, the vehicle might appear to be moving backwards (or "retreating").  The next time you visit an airport, notice that the US-flagged aircraft also have a "reverse" flag painted on the right side of the aircraft.  For flag patches worn on uniforms, the same principle applies: the blue star field always faces towards the front, with the red and white stripes behind. Think of the flag, not a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole. As the Soldier moves forward, the red and white stripes will flow to the back.  Another question we are often asked: Doesn't a red, white, and blue flag on a camouflaged uniform defeat the purpose of camouflage? Yes, it does. Previously the U.S. Code prescribed that military use of the flag will always be red, white, and blue. However, with the updated Army Battle Dress Uniform that was recently unveiled, the flag patch will become a camouflage, muted color.

      Here's what  I learned (cuz Shelly asked, and I found)  Question: Why does it appear that the United States Flag is worn "backwards" on the sleeves of deployed soliders?   Answer: Army Regulation 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia, is the governing authority for the wear of Army uniforms. Paragraph 28-18 governs the wear of the United States Flag on Army Uniforms.  The flag may only be worn on the utility and organizational uniforms (such as the camouflage BDU). The flag may only be worn during joint-duty and multinational deployments. When the servicemember returns to home station, the flag must be removed. (Guide Note: A message went out in February 2004 changing this restriction, and making the U.S. Flag a mandatory uniform componant for all soldiers, effective October 1, 2005).  Chapter 1, Title 4, United States Code, provides for the design of the U.S. flag and specifies the colors as red, white, and blue. Colors other than red, white, and blue violate the U.S. Code; therefore, subdued-colored flags are not authorized for wear. Joint commanders have to make the decision as to whether or not the wear of a full-color flag, for morale purposes, is more important than having all aspects of the uniform camouflaged.  When approved for wear, the full-color U.S. flag cloth replica is sewn 1/2 inch below the right shoulder seam of the temperate, hot-weather, enhanced hot-weather, and desert BDU; the BDU field jacket; and the cold-weather uniform. The flag is worn on the right shoulder, because, in the military, the "place of honor" is to a military member's right.  The full-color U.S. flag cloth replica is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right, and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward.  The rule dates back to the Army’s early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward momentum caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.

      Abhg (that was supposed to be an AHH, but it turned out much cooler!(its the little things in life, right?)   Tonight was so very fun.  I went to Shelly's.  I adore that girl.  I'm so glad she's around... I don't know what I would do without her.  We watched Chasing Liberty which was (surprisingly) cute.  I told Shelly many stories, mostly about European travels and the like.  That reminds me, I have to look up 2 things.  Then I will let you know of my discoveries.    Haha, funny times...my fave though, we were done watching Chasing Liberty, and we were watching I love the 90's (o and how I do!) and Jay and Silent Bob were on.   Now Bob holds up signs, and jay is reading them.  All the sudden Shelly goes "Wait is that guy silent?"  It was funny, considering his name is SILENT bob..

      My week (thus far)   Always an exciting life for Chrissy.    Saturday on my way home from Grand old Wautoma I stopped in West Bend, for my cousin's wedding shower,for which I am a bridesmaid.  My aunt bought me records for homecoming and I got the top of my dress.  We shall see how that all turns out.  Then it was home to unpack, and then Shelly called to inform me that her and Kristin were on her way...AHHH that meant I had to shower in the like 6 minutes it takes to get here.   It was a quick shower.   After almost falling asleep at Shelly's, I came home and watched the DVD from training week.  Also in that huge mess Emily Waldorf called, and we discussed my week at camp.  Twas all in all, a good yet exhausting day.  Sunday I went to church at 8 (yawn!) Then my sister and I ventured out to my Grandma's for her 80th birthday.  I knew you were supposed to go to Madison, but she said no, and we wound up in Menominee Falls, so we took the scenic route...We went to Olive Garden, it was a good time. Sat with the cousins.  It was a fun time.  Then we went back to my Grandma's for a bit.  Then it was home, and off to Anna's with Shelly.     Monday was pretty boring.  I started teaching VBS (vacation bible school).  They are so cute!  Then I just came home and worked out.  After that I spent the day cleaning.  We didn't eat dinner until 8:30, so I just got a lot of sleep.  Tuesday was more VBS. Then I went to J-Mo's, where we tanned and hung out.  We also watched little Jazzie, who's becoming cuter by the second.   Then  I went to babysitting.  That was fun, I missed those kids.   Today was more VBS, those kids are so cute, one of the little girls kissed a boy! They were both three.  One of the cutest things ever.  Then it was DECA Offiers Lunch with Megan and Anna.  Then Anna and I went shopping for DECA stuff. Good times, I love those girls.     Alright, its off to clean and eat, then hanging out with Shelly!   Love lots. Chrissy!

        Haha, from Ernest Goes to Camp...just for fun!   Gee I'm glad it's raining    There's always something to be thankful for.    I'm awfully glad it's raining    Cause no one sees the tear drops when it pours.          And no one knows the thunder    As your heart breaks in the sky,    And they think those rainy nights    Cause that sad look in your eye.          Sure am glad it's raining.    The gentle river soothes the pain inside.    I'm glad the stars aren't shining.    This wounded warrior needs a place to hide.          I thought I had found someone    I could count til the end.    What they wanted was a hero,    All I needed was a friend          Gee I'm glad it's raining.    I hope the morning sun won't come up soon.    As long as it keeps raining,    No one knows my heart broke right in two.          I thought I had found someone    I could count til the end.    What they wanted was a hero,    All I needed was a friend         Sure am glad it's raining.    I'm awfully glad it's raining      A few more camp memories: Singing Brown Eyed Girl with Elliot (all Bethany and I knew was the Sha-La-La part, so we would randomly sing that), seeing that huge turkey thing (dear me, i thought it was going to eat us, luckily we were inside), Renee trying to get rid of her campers (hey, Jared, why don't you take them for awhile...)  I hate being home...

      Why hello again!  Unfortunately, I'm back in South Milwaukee again.   I just got back from a week of volunteering at camp.   O man, it was so much fun. I had so many good times. For those of you from camp, one of my campers was Alex Vnderberg's girlfriend's sister.  She was SUCH a cutie!  It was weird, being at camp without Steph.  I still had so much fun! ~Kumquat game (it sounds like you're asking me to quat!) ~the broken dishwasher, us going crazy when it worked agaim ~THat sounds like the name of a donut ~Getting thrown in the lake  ~Playing What are you doing? for campfire ~being kindnapped for our evening game (which was disastourous) ~ The Jesus Cares campers (Lisa's Elliot obsession) ~Getting to see Emily Kasperzak! ~staying up until 1 on our night off ~ Bethany and I singing in the shower (OH conditioner) I don't think I've laughed THAT hard in a really long time ~Ernest goes to camp   ~I don't get it (HEY THAT'S exactly what they say in the song!) ~Their dog doesn't have the same highlights ~stealing the last peanut butter cup from borck ~Twister, Bent Outta Shape, and getting matthew's house wet ~Jake's rule when he was little: "Good is good, bad is bad, so don't be bad, cuz bad is bad" ~ Our melon hut for informal formal Ahh,  it was such a fun week, I'll miss you all so much!    Aww a cute story: One of my campers didn't have nerves in her right arm, meaning she really couldn't feel anything and didn't have full range of motion in her arm.  She was amazying though, she did EVERYTHING.   I never heard her say that she needed help or couldn't do something.  Anyhow, we were talking about how our problems turn out to be blessings, and she goes " I think God made my arm this way, becasuse it makes me unique."  It was SO cute.  I had such a good week, the campers were all so awesome (other than the 2 who started physically fighting, they were cute, just a little problem...)   I just found out, for this week, VBS I'm doing the 3 and 4 year olds.  It'll be so fun, but I'll miss hearing them sing in church, becuase I leave Saturday for vacation.    So a little schedule of the Chrissy Monday-Friday- Teach VBS Tuesday (night) babysit Wed (Night)- woek Saturday-Leave for Branson July 24- Return from branson July 25-31- either camp. or a break.

      Oh gosh.  I haven't been home to update this in a while.   This past week was fun, had some good times at Senate Camp (yes, it solitifies my complete dorkiness)...but you still love me.   We had to cut from a fake budget, all that jazz.   Lindy was absolutely hilarious, and her, Alex and I had a fun week.   I don't think I'll ever forget you Family FORE!   Hallway Parties, and Kristin falling out of the chair, Airen's stories...This one time (followed by some near death experience).   Ariel was an awesome roommate, her random spelling story still cracks me up...  Pictures will be up, But probably not until after Camp next week.    The night before all that hoopla, Sarah and took in an exciting day at Summerfest, saw Kenny Chesney, who is both hot and preformed an awesome concert.  Sarah is hilarious, I'm so glad we went together.  Pearachute? Lol no, hun, thats not how you spell it, nor is that what it is....haha, I love yoU!  So today was such an awesome day.   First I get a letter from Matt as I'm leaving camp.   Then I get home, and my ACT score is here.   I got a 30.   Then there were a few magazines, misc. college info, and then a letter from Ali German!!  I absolutely ADORE her.   So I got 2 camp letters today!  yay! and then I got to hang out with my J-Mo.   I'm in a super awesome mood.   Dashboard concert is prolly starting right now, and even though they are my most favorite group ever, I'm so tired, I know it would not have been fun.   Also I work tomorrow, and since  I open,  it would not have been pretty waking up after a concert.  My voice is also gone....hmm I don't knoww how that happened. Summer Schedule for Chrissy  July 4-10 Camp Phillip July 12-16- Teach VBS, but home at night July 17-24- Missouri August 1-6 Teach VBS Day Camp at Salem in Milwaukee, Stay with host August 8- Tennis starts August 12- Leave for Cousin's wedding August 15- Return from Sarah's wedding in MN  And there goes my summer!
