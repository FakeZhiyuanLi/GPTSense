      1.  6pm, Standing on 2nd Avenue btwn Starbucks and Burittoville. You've got a great haircut, a threadbare t-shirt and groceries, and you're talking to a short, chubby, neo-goth girl. I was going to get a buritto, but I follow you into Starbucks instead. I stand in line behind you and I hear you explain to your neo-goth friend that you were designing wedding invitations all day for a particularly difficult client. I suddenly get a mental flash - you lying back on a bed, hand pressed down on my head, raging hardon in my mouth - then internally chastise myself for thinking this way. You order a large iced coffee and ask Neo-Goth Friend which way she's walking. She says, "i'm taking a cab, this box I'm holding is heavy." She's obviously asking you to walk her home and help her carry that box - she's obviously smitten with you - but you're being cagey. That's my boy. Maybe you deserve a blowjob after all.  2.  6:15pm. I toss my small (tall?) coffee in the wastebasket and head up St. Marks with my Powerbook open, looking for a signal. I have to email a document but I don't feel like going home. I sit on a bench outside Yaffa Cafe and get to work. You're sitting outside by yourself, smoking a cigarette, reading a book, finishing a coffee. You and I blatantly stare at each other, our faces expressionless. I am waiting for you to give up or crack. You go inside to pay and I unbotton my sweater so's when you come out you'll be able to see my rack. You hesitate in front of the restaurant for a moment as if you're deciding which way to go. I pretend to be shielding my eyes from the sun, but really I'm veiling the fact that I'm staring right at you. Terrible jeans. Terrible. Some kind of wash of denim that should be illegal. Please, please, please - just walk away.  3.  Jason Bateman. You are a professional actor and former child star. I saw you in the fiilm  Dodgeball  2 nights ago. Mr. Bateman, this film is a work of cinematic genius, and, also, I think I am in love with you. This is not a conclusion that I've come to hastily. It started earlier this season on  Arrested Development , your situation comedy that airs Sunday nights on FOX. You were seducing gues star Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a completely inept fashion. That hit me right here. But  Dodgeball  made it all too real. I don't want any talk, Jason Bateman. Just you and me, flailing around like I'm a blind lawyer. What do you think, Jason Bateman? Your place or mine?

      Monday, June 21, 1:41 pm. My new Favorite Breakfast Place, 1st and 10th.  Are you gay, young man? I think I've seen you around the neighborhood before, and I can't tell. You're better looking than I would usually like - DETAILS Magazine good looking. Oh! But look at your ass. Thank you for getting up and asking for a glass of water.  I like that matching arm cuff look. Very  The O.C. . But the big silver rings have got to go. And your sunglasses. Uh-uh. Sorry, Maybe Fag, The sunglasses are a deal breaker. It was fun while it lasted, but now my heartbeat is returning to normal.  See you around.

      Sunday, June 20, 6pm. I went into the Starbucks on 2nd and 9th because I desperately had to pee. There was a line and I was also ravenously hungry, so I bought a sandwich and sat down by the window and plugged in my computer to keep me busy as I waited for the loo. When I saw you, I decided to stay.  You are sitting two tables over, wearing a blue-and-black striped sweater, jeans, really awful brown dress shoes ... and ear plugs. Oh gosh. You're so cute I want to cry. You sort of remind me of the hot-dog delivery boy from  Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead  - and now I truly know how lucky Christina Applegate was.   You look so young, 20 maybe, too young for me. And what awful, awful shoes. And uh-oh - further examination shows that you have a copy of a Syd Field screenwriting manual on the table in front of you. Maybe you're just holding it for a friend. I'll go with that explanation, Ear Plugs.    I keep getting up for no reason so I can look at you from different angles. This is exceedingly stupid, as every time I do so, I am leaving my $1700 computer and my cell phone and my purse with all of my credit cards unattended. Also, I have a coffee stain on my white skirt from this morning's brunch and I havn't washed my hair in two days - I'm not in the best shape. There is no point in me trying to show off for you or get you to talk to me. I'll just sit here in the corner and stare, and blush every time you notice. Carry on, Ear Plugs. I'll just admire you from over here.   Oh, fuck. You're gone. I looked up and you left and now I've lost you. Shit.

      ...but now, finally, there's something to watch:  It's truly startling how deep affected I am by boys with certain haircuts. I can't even really tell whether or not Greasy Bowl Cut is even attractive. All i know is, I picked him out from across the computer repair store, and now my jaw won't go back to it's upright locked position.   He is examining the motherboard of the G5 that he is picking up from the service desk. I am woozy with lust.   He's got one of those wallet-marks in the right-back-pocket of his jeans. I'm staring at it and imagining what his cock looks like.   He's got a bit of a potbelly, which is not well served by his tight, light-blue, threadbare ironic t-shirt. I don't care.   Oh! He's bending over. His shirt is going up and his jeans are going down. His panties have a stripey-waistband that I would like to run my finger underneath.  I'm blatantly oggling him, but I don't think he can even see me.  They're going to take my computer away from me in a second. If I was a boy, I'd have to find something else to put on my lap to hide my erection.
