       Aside from it being Latoya's breast, why do you think a peek of it remains a "tempest in a c-cup" [Matt Lauer,  Today Show  , Today.] ?   What is  it  about a women's breast that so many find obscene?  They can't be inherently obscene or you would have to think that God was a bit of a voyeur. In fact, if I remember right one of the first signs of sin was that Adam and Eve covered up.   Supposedly breasts are covered up because they're sexual organs; but, to my memory neither men's nor women's breasts are essential to sex... only just one of  the perks.   I'll admit that it plays a part in rearing the offspring, but that doesn't seem to be the issue because most places don't consider nursing an obscene act.  If it's not the function, then what is it? The size? The shape? No, otherwise sumo wrestlers and heavy guys etc couldn't go topless but flat chested women could... so it comes back down to the obvious...   They're obscene because the certain people (who shall remain nameless) think of them in conjunction with obscene acts... My, my such dirty minds...   Now, I won't say who they are; but, next time you hear someone complaining about Latoya's or any other set being obscene -- you'll know who I'm talking about.

       Where did my mind go?    For three days, I've been wandering around through classwork, homework, housework, momwork, and doing what I could but not completely succeeding at any of it. Why? Maybe it's been a really rough week. But, I've had those before so this doesn't seem like the most resonable answer.   Well whereever it's been. I'm back. I think.  But, here's another question. How can you really tell if you're back or still there thinking your back? And, why can't you remember where you go when you werent here. It's the zoned out thing just without the drugs.   Oh by the way, anyone out there who's into standing up for others/ noble causes/lost causes... there's a couple of sites set up to save the WB show   Angel.    urlLink www.savingangel.com  and  urlLink savingangel.org   They've even connected to a few decent rallies and will be having a rally tomorrow.   For the traditionalists though... check out  urlLink care2.com  or  urlLink amnesty.org ... Go ahead Just.[...] it .

       How can they say that?   Reading an  urlLink AP story  about the rescue attempts to save a right whale named Kingfisher, it amazed me to read some of the comments made in the article by both the scientists and the author William L Holmes.   For instance:  "We're cautiously  optimistic  about it," said Kent Laborde, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration." ...  While describing Kingfisher's plight [that the approximately "250 feet of half-inch rope wrap[ped around] the animal's body, cutting into its skin and possibly into its bone... hindering its ability to swim lines around... and will continue to tighten as it grows, killing the animal within weeks or months."    I can see the caution... but not the optimism.     Here's another one I thought odd:    "Whales often don't need to be disentangled from debris"   the author writes...    but    "About  60 percent  of right whales become entangled in fishing lines, according to the Center for Coastal Studies, which does applied research and marine mammal rescues. "  I guess  60% of a species  doesn't seem alot when there are only  three hundred  of them left.... How silly of me.

       How far and how often can you bend your beliefs before they break?   Although, I try to follow a close to vegan eating style, this morning I fell to temptation:   A luscious white-chocolate-bread-pudding served hot and glazed with an orange caramel sauce [from La's Bistro, on Granada Blvd in Ormond Beach [across from the produce market and the library].           It was heavenly. The real problem is that I go to the library at least once a week to do research for class; and La's has always been a nice stop in for a coffee or cappucino [even though their cappucino is a bit bitter for my tastes], a croissant, and some fresh fruit... usually with melons... which aren't my favorite but begger's can't be choosers and like most restaraunts , La's doesn't have a very expansive vegetarian menu.           Now this bread pudding is temptation itself and it's going to be hard not to re-order it despite the eggs. My belief system and lifestyle may not break because of it, but if I keep stopping by on fridays... they're bound to be tarnished.

      Last night an online classmate [or a class mate from my online class (MBA at UOPhx)]  described my writing style in one post as dissection. I love it.    Dissection Anyone?   Or maybe, I just love the image/thought of me in surgeon's blues, cap, gown, mask, and booties leaning over my old, defunct, pooh-let hacker lap top, scalpel in hand... cutting class posts... and pasting my responses with liquid band-aid.    [Oops, I just read back over that description ... add the pants, surgeon's slacks, or something, I'm definately wearing those]. Otherwise it would just be just plain weird.   Now the real question is  did I remember the anesthesia?

       My pre-coffee thoughts:  I think there is probably a metaphysical, logical, and odd argument that old nick/lucifer needs an anti-depressent or psychological care.     Here's the argument:      All things created by God are in a state of being during their lifetime.  Lucifer was created by God.   ----------------------------    Lucifer is in a state of being during his lifetime.     Lucifer is in a state of being during his lifetime.  All entities in a state of being are beings.  ----------------------------------   Lucifer is a being.      Lucifer is a being that has turned away from God [bible].  All beings that turn away from God are in despair. [ soren kirkegaard].  ------------------------------    Lucifer is in despair.      Lucifer's state of dispair is eternal [i.e. chronic] [soren kirkegaard].  Chronic despair/depression requires treatment. [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/                     publicat/depression.cfm]  -------------------------------    Lucifer requires treatment.       Lucifer's state of despair/depression is severe. [soren kirkegaard]  Severe cases of despair/depression should be prescribed mixed regimines of psychotherapy and drug treatment. http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ publicat                                                      /depression.cfm#ptdep5  ----------------------------------    Lucifer's state of despair/depression should be prescribed mixed regimines of psychotherapy and drug treatment.     So... any doc ready to take on that case?    Wonder what my post-coffee thoughts will be.

       Care to hear some good news?    I've been hired as an adjunct professor in the English program at my community college. It makes me a tiny bit nervous that Sen. Jim King, the presumed to be  honorable , but that's somewhat debatable, representative of Florida's citizen's has pushed through a budget cutting 1.1 million from the Volusia County's already underfunded schools on the grounds that it can be done because instructors are already on one of the lowest pay rates in the state of Florida despite the fact that our already diminished budgets have labeled us one of the "loser districts" for the past four years straight.   I wonder if King has considered, during any of his costly and state funded vacations, that the salaries already "kept down by amenities such as sunny beaches, cultural and recreational opportunities, climate, public services, and low taxes" are already so low that many teachers are taking second and third jobs at $6.00 an hour and lower just to make ends meet. During this Christmas season, I took a seasonal sales position at J.C. Penneys to scrape by and ran into 16 other instructors ranging from grade school teachers to community college instructors doing the same... just at that one store.   Also.. there's a big problem with this "amenities" argument: Although Volusia County has some cultural activities, it cannot be compared to the amenities offered at larger cities such as Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, or Orlando. Additionally, we have no major sports teams, nor a major university like in Tallahassee or Gainesville. Volusia County has no seaport and few large businesses or employers. Looking at the big picture, I can't see why Volusia County children should be further deprived of needed supplies, instructors, and educational opportuntiies simply because we are located by a beach... that most teachers don't have the time to visit between their survival jobs.

       Where's the website?    Well, I don't know yet. But I hope to shortly. It's still exam week and I'm halfway through my final for the Regulatory Environment of Business Law... [That's a long way of saying "the first year of Law School" in six weeks]... and I went through the first year of Law school...  But, I'm feeling much better now,  to borrow an old night court line ... actually, I really loved it ... But, it was just too tough at an already too tough time of my life... Just before Larkin passed. Borrowing from a Dharma and Greg reference > 5 bottles of antacid a day, 10 aspirins, 15 espresso's, and  an  ulcer: It was the best time of my life. Aside from losing Larkin,  it really may have been.   In part because it's where I met DMV... [no I didn't get a lot of tickets]. DMV is in many senses a kindred spirit, my closest friend, and one of the three people in my life that I consider to be a mentor/guru. In fact she's the one who pointed out how g.u.r.u. worked as a mnemonic for self-actualization... gee-you-are-you... It sort of fits.   The other two are my brother MSH, and another friend  FSF from school in the bachelor's program actually, but another kindrid spirit... In some ways DMV and FSF seem Gendered Versions of the Same spirit... but I don't think I'll elaborate on that ... at least not until the exam's over.     Take Care

       Ack, so much for my daily adventures in life... the final exam has started EEEEk... where's my coffee, wipped chocolate cheese cake [sic: I don't suppose the Women's Institution for Public Policy is currently selling cheesecake with their memberships, but they should.] oops, back to the mindless tirade, where's my coffee [hey it always bears repeating] and where's my double chocolate whipped cheese cake [same theory] and my mood music, and while I'm at it where's my mind because I must have left it somewhere along with the answers that I knew I knew yesterday.   What's up?   Surely, you didn't think I'd forget my question of the day? Did ya? There - there are three questions for the price of one.

       Is it arrogance?   I woke up yesterday to one of the lectures of an evangelist preaching on the same teen-oriented channel that had played both  Charmed  and  Angel  the evening before... Not that this  is a problem, but having listened to a portion of his sermon ...at the very least, it's  a conflict of interest. What really caught my attention was one remark that the preacher/pastor/evangelist:   "It's   God's  Goal in life  to bring us closer to him."  I couldn't help but think that was the height of arrogance. Maybe, I'm wrong. If you give the messiah scenario full faith and credit, God will [or has already*] sacrificed his child to 'pay for our sins." But, I would like to think that God/The Creator/The Divine source... did not just stop with us. Talk about anti-climactic and unambitious.  No, I prefer to believe that God's not just a one trick pony...too obsessed with getting his first trick right to work on anything new. So, to me it's arrogant to think our salvation is God's Highest ambition and goal in life.  But let me know if I'm wrong.   *depending your religious affiliation.

       Any body out there?   If you are and  If you're interested, I'm hoping to launch a website/online community dedicated to working on-life.    in as many forms and forums as possible including coalitions to make the most active and effective use of web-based advocacy tools and sites.      in  forums about setting and reaching our goals whether it's to go to Harvard or get a job by the end of the year or write a country-western screenplay or simply find the right hair color for you.     in any way that we can work on life whether through art, games, chat, humor, music, or advocacy.   Almost any idea is worth discussing and sharing [you know what I mean by almost]. So, if you are interested check back in a few days,  I'll post the address as soon as I have finalized the page construction process.

       Anyone know of a great math simulation site?  If you do urlLink  email  the address to me Please.   I think I may need one. I'm about two mini semesters off from my statistics course, and I had a real shock Tuesday. About 7 years ago, I had studied and studied to pass an honors statistics class at DBCC, and did pass - with an A no less.  But Tuesday, a student who knew that I also tutor up to College Algebra came by and asked a few questions about statistics [from the third chapter of the same book and edition that I studied] that completely baffled me.    What makes it worse is that some how, I'm fairly certain that MBA statistics courses are going to be harder than AA statistics courses.   HELP!

       Can eyes implode?   Mine certainly feel like they would like the option. I am soooooooooooo tired. Was up to the weee hours working on a team paper. Sans team. Well that's not true two teammates posted worthwhile information, but the third.... not even close. Unfortunately for the second week in a row, I waited for him to pull his work through...then went back and researched it for myself and added what little [very little I could from his post to the paper]. I really don't need this kind of  @#$%#@.  But, I'm at a loss on what to do. If I pull back on the work that I've been doing and noone takes it up, my grade will fall right along with the rest of my teammate's grades.  I've tried to gently hint, then a little more bluntly, then frankly, but the response seems to be that I'm viewed as being a "little overly assertive". At the same time, two team members did not even begin researching a fairly complicated question [about whether 2 collectives should form multiple businesses and of what form from partnership to corporation] untill  the late evening  on the day it was due when the assignment had been posted all week.  I don't think it would have seemed so bad, even then if I wasn't the person integrating papers for the second week in a row.    I really could turn banshee right about now so I really really plan to stay away from the team folder... at least until my fourth coffee.

       Thinking of online Classes?    Think twice. At least before signing up for UOP's courses....Please. Mind you, I'm really enjoying the courses... And seem to be pulling the grades fairly well [my cumm. GPA is 3.66 at the moment] but sooo much of the work is related through online team assignments and I seem to be running hit and miss with team selection. My last team was actually willing to communicate in an active manner and through real time discussions, but this team.... is almost a no go. I'm soooo frustrated I could scream when I read some of the messages.    Monday, one of my team mates posted his own response as a team response to a team question, then yesterday that he thought it was an individual assignment.... but that doesn't explain why the header of his post was labeled Team DQ, and two of his posts prior to this acknowledged that fact. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Aaaggh.    Please, Please, Please ,  if you are thinking of online courses   and lack commitment or like mind games  -   Think twice  about UOP  and sign up elsewhere . I'll even make it a bit easier...

Where all that I have to do [and often all that I can do] is click to offer some support , and I am always stunned how much there is to click. It's amazing how unstable and unkind life can be. Well of course it's not life that's being unkind. Its violence, poverty, illness, despair, and all of them fueled by inequality, racism, nationalism, and greed. It's so disheartening even sickening in itself, but if even a clck can help... how can I not.

       Got Mercury?   Well, the EPA's top officials don't seem to care if you do. Take a look at this mercury  urlLink letter . It's sort of sickening. With all the known effects and the EPA's own reports warn:    " urlLink When [Mercury] is vaporized and inhaled, it can be very, very toxic. Initial symptoms include a cough, breathing difficulties, and chest pain. Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and nerve or kidney problems may develop later "(http://www.epa.gov/seahome/mercury/src/florida1.htm).  " urlLink Patients... [suffer]...numbness of the limbs and the area around the mouth, sensory disturbance, and difficulty with hand movements (such as grasping things, fastening buttons, holding chopsticks, writing, etc.); also, there was lack of coordination, weakness and tremor, slowed and slurred speech, and ataxic gait, followed by disturbances of vision, and hearing. These symptoms became aggravated and led to general paralysis, deformity of the limbs, difficulty in swallowing, convulsions, and death " (http://www.epa.gov/seahome/mercury/src/minamata.htm).  I hope more people start getting ticked off about this... If more people don't, who knows what the EPA will think up next.

       How long should the mourning period for  Angel  last?   I can't believe that it's ended. It has ended? Has it ended?  Well, bye bye WB because whoever picks up Angel, picks up me.  Ohhhh, that was too close to the line that Angel needed to rephrase.   But what about the ending? To have signed away his 'right' to turn human again?  I loved that last little bit about the dragon slayer... it really fits...  and Spike finally getting back to poetry in what looked like a beat-biker bar.  How perfect. Who would have thought you could find a rhyme for "my heart has a bulge in it". And, Connor's line "So, you come to have coffee-- And the world's not coming to an end? Right" [that's a poor paraphrase, but it's still a good line]. But then Lorne's exit and Wesley's - the commercials said their would be one that won't come back, but which is it? (And does that presume that the others will come back on one channel or another). Almost everyone on the show has died at least once if not multiple times so Wesley's death after being a vessel for major 'mojo'- may not be a certainty. And, I'm still not certain that there isn't a trace of fred left in Aleria to come back (as a spinoff?).   But here's a question... where was the promised final key to Angel's destiny?  There's almost a paradox there, in the idea of signing away his destiny to become human?  If he does, then -particularly with spike on-scene- could the prophecy really have been about him? And, if not, then could he sign away a right he didn't have to begin with? And would the powers that be enforce a contract signed essentially under duress for the purposes of forwarding the Power's own interests?

       Am I in trouble?   I discovered my computer's DVD program a few nights ago when I was trying to find something to inspire a little energy while I was trying to finish up a discussion question. Naturally, I went for an Angel DVD, perhaps feeling a bit nostalgic for the rapidly ending series. I still cannot discern why the WB would call it to so short of an end when there are so many story lines yet to work through and so many fans waiting to see them. It's one of those shows like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Garrison Keeler's (sp?) Prarie Home Companion that subtly reminds you that you're not quite as old or grown up as you thought. Maybe I'm just a fan of angst, but it did the trick - both keeping me awake and stirring up traces of both energy and creativity.  But since that evening, I have had the frequent habit of reaching for one DVD after another to accompany my studies.

       Ever have one of those too absolutely exhausted to do much of anything, but wanting to do something... until the something turns out to be laying a new dreain field?    Boy has it been one of those weeks.... Jacqueline was hurt when she fell into a window. I can't tell you how that scared me. She has been such a stoic about it though. I usually believe in supporting my children's feelings and emotional expressions but I think I would have lost it if she had. Just remembering how the wounds first looked makes me nauseous. I was so scared that it was so much worse than it turned out to be. I could just see the muscle being cut. But, she was soooo lucky that the person who framed the window did such a good job.   I'll have to finish this later... and yes there is a drainfield involved, but I 'promise I won't get descriptive about that.   Bye

       Isn't it odd?...     How someone can mean a great deal to you without you even being aware of the fact?   I hadn't realized how saddened I would be by President Reagan's death.  So many years have passed since I have really put much thought into either the President's or the First Lady's existence, conditions, or activities...  then the President dies  and like the foam of a suddenly shaken soda, everything ( my feelings, my composure, my sense of the world )... everything is shaken up, caught by the air and churned, and my every thought of the couple is accompanied with tearful sadness, mourning, and gratitude.   Saturday, watching The First,   First Lady  , of whom I have any memories, gracefully and caring-ly run her hand down the President's coffin as she might have and must have so often run her palm down his arm, as couples do, to hold and pat his hand, then patting him ... patting the flag, the symbol which he so aptly, so kindly, and so authentically embodied, then running her palm back up patting, and leaning in -   to him  ... was the most touching, painful moment I can remember witnessing.  I wonder now, if she had chosen that moment to say good bye.   Thinking of this, even now, has me sniffling and wiping away tears. I am awfully glad I don't wear mascara to work. The world has seemed diminished this week, not solely by his death, but by the cessation, at least in this frame of existence, of their journey together... of their devoted love and companionship. This seems sadder to me than the loss of a great, authentic leader and diplomat.   To my soul, it feels like a stone carved truth, that for the most noble and best aspects of life to continue their existence, there must be in every few generations, perhaps in every country, a person or persons with the courage to embody and to stand out with their presence as an embodiment of some noble aspect. In this instance, together, I think, they embodied the best potential of deepest dedication and love between two people... even to the exclusion of others. Understandably, and by some accounts that I have heard, this exclusion must have caused some great pain to their children and friends. I am not certain, however, that it could have been otherwise... as these embodiments often have seemed so intense as to be at the exclusion of all other considerations and individuals. Perhaps, they have to be to stand out.   I wish though that we as a culture could begin to recognize these instances more formally... in our language... A Reagan-like love, A Hawkings-like intellect, A Tubman-like fortitude. Perhaps something more along the lines of "A Reaganic love", somehow that sounds more fitting to the President's Scotch-English-Irish/American heritage...   I wonder if that's what it is... scotch, english, irish, American... is that part of this feeling. It feels like it's more than losing a president who I was bearly aware of as a thirteen year old...It's as close as I can imagine to what it must have been like to lose a gaelic or scottish clan-leader... even one distantly removed... a feeling as if someone of your blood, your family, your strength has passed. I've often wondered how much of our heritage is written into our cell memories, into our essence. I know that for as long as I can remember before I knew of geography and distance and heritage or even what my particular heritage was... I have had the deepest affinity with all that was and is Irish and Scottish as well- but to a lesser extent. I don't honestly know.  But, I have been surprised by the frequency of my tears and the depth of my heartache these past few days. The world seems diminished... even if it was a proper age and time of passing for him, even though he was out of office, and in a situation where lengthining his endurance could not have been a blessing... his absence is painful... more painful than I had expected. I can not fathom what it must be for the First Lady.

       Remember Me?   I barely do. I've been so wrapped up in working on my final project for Marketing Management 551- A marketing audit for my own business... that I have let everything get behind. Particularly my Email. When I checked last night, my care2 email account said that I have 5770 kb of messages. unfortunately my account setting is limited to 3000! I'll spend weeks cutting it down.  But on  the upside ...  at least I know I'm loved. Thanks e-Telemarketers!

      Well, that's been a while.. I'll try to get back into the habit of blogging, but things have gotten so busy lately that I could ask "WHY ME?" but I know the answer to that one.
