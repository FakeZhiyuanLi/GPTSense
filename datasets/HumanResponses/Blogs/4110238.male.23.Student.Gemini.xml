       tattoos, hot with all kinds of ts, talking to amie, break-ups, napoleon dynamite, serious flashbacks, lots of boxes and books, the last day of work, getting ready for school, howard dean, almost crying, playing dominoes, disappointing some people, making inroads with others, imagining alternatives, seeking to make amends, thinking too much, doing too little, and finally looking for more.  happy friday, welcome autumn...

       Pretty soon I'll stop naming posts after things I gleaned from the Modest Mouse CD.  Until then...live with it!  I bought a new phone today and it is so awesome!  It's sad how excited I am, but I don't really care.  Technology rules...and so what if I'm like a couple of years behind everyone else.  Anyway it's a camera phone with a sweet color screen, "polyphonic ringtones" (I love that phrase!), and lots of other gadgets and features that I totally don't need but am completely going to love!  Plus I upgraded...now I get more text messages (I've been using a lot lately), multimedia messages, and wireless Internet access.  Isn't that crazy?  Isn't it fabulous?  Hell yeah!!!

       So I'm only working part time this week, in order to "prep for school"...that means I get off at noon everyday.  Woo-hoo!  In a few more days I will be done with that place for good!  I'm actually ready for school to start...I even bought my books today, and reserved a locker at Gregory Gym.  I want to get r-i-p-p-e-d.  Is that so much to ask?  This is the semester I'm gonna get my shit together.  I swear.  Today's highlights include:  *A great chat with Braden, to whom I confessed my undying love and devotion.  He took it in stride...  *Shopping with Lena...but why the hell didn't I buy anything?  *Hearing Jill's awesome, hott (that's hot with  two  Ts) story.  That was good stuff.  Tomorrow I'm going to see Outfoxed (if we get tickets) to learn about the evil ways of super-villain Rupert Murdoch.  Then on Sunday I'm gonna see...Howard Dean!  In person!  How freaking exciting is that?*  *Caution: level of dorkiness is ORANGE, or "elevated."

       Since it's been a while since I've posted, I'll try and highlight the past few days as briefly as possible...  ...and that proves to be impossible, because I don't remember a lot happening.  Well there were a few things, I suppose:  *First, the crazy Bollywood movie at Spider House.  I still don't know it's name, but I am shocked (shocked I tell you!) at how  freaking long  it turned out to be.  It was basically your typical boy meets girl story, and typically Bollywood, involving an arranged marriage that no one really wanted to take place.  I'm only mentioning this movie because, well, there were some killer song and dance routines.  Otherwise it was terrible.  *More stoner adventures on Friday night: I'm thinking my character under the influence is pretty mellow and pretty quiet, which is nice but somewhat disappointing.  I was hoping to open up more, not get quieter...  *Helping Lena move on Saturday, to an apartment on the 3rd floor...and boy was I sore today.  Then various computer related difficulties surrounding the installation of a new hard drive.  The big news of the past three days?  The opening of the XXVIIIth Olympiad (it's Olympics time again) mean two weeks of thinking "wow where did the last four years go" and "man, why do people like sports so much?".  The outing of New Jersey's gay governor was jaw-droppingly stunning...like  urlLink Jillian , I have mixed feelings about what it means for the future of gay politicians (something I'm pretty interested in).  Most depressingly, California's Supreme Court nullified the marriage licenses of almost 4,000 same-sex couples, meaning that all those happy, loving couples we saw on the news a few months ago are now back to square one--almost, that is.  Issuing those marriage licenses may have been a terrible idea legally (setting gay marriage back in California rather than pushing it forward), but it was a historically significant act of civil disobedience that might have done more for gay and lesbian rights than anything happening in Massachusetts.  Why?  Because what decent American could reasonably find fault with people so obviously in love, and so obviously committed to loving and caring for one another in marriage that they would defy their government, their society, and even their culture to affirm with such boldness the strength of their union?

       "I didn't do much today, so logically I probably shouldn't be posting."  Before I sat down, that thought passed through my head--then I realized this is a  blog ; it's not about what happens to you.  All that matters is what you say!  Blogging is  performance !  So, that being said, here are today's contributions to the information superhighway (or, as  urlLink Jillian  puts it, the Internerd):  1)  Since the end of summer draws ever nearer, I need to retitle my blog (not because the current title sucks): you can submit your suggestions in the comments section, or  urlLink email  them to me.  Is it lame to come up with titles related to things I've read in books?  2) Talked to Jillian for a while tonight (see link above); disappointed her because I cannot play hooky at work tomorrow and go shop with her in Dallas.  Oh if only I could!  Northpark is definitely a place that makes me happy.  Plus there's the  urlLink Lacoste  store...  3)  Did a really bad thing and bought some cookies tonight...Chips Ahoy!, which I don't even really like.  Bad, bad me!  Then I started to compare myself to other guys, and I said to myself, I says, Tim, just put down those cookies.  Just back away from the cookies.  Just throw the cookies away...  I mean I only weigh 160...maybe I am anorexic (see earlier post)...  (timtheta looks over this post and realizes, man...what is going on in my life that I consider  this  newsworthy?)

       heart racing...temples pounding...i've felt this feeling before hands shaking...knees unsteady...where is this leading?  slow day...called in sick (i'm tired of working!); does this mean i'm loosening up?  (felt irresponsible all day, except for the time i spent sleeping...)  braden!  you and your crazy drama dude!  i love it, even though my heart really does go out to you...that sucks man!  ridiculous gay soap operas!  was gonna see supersize me, but got there and it was sold out...damn alamo drafthouse!  damn dollar ticket night!  which brings us to...now...and that feeling...

       So Jillian's prophecy is being fulfilled: instead of being funny, this blog is turning into more of a diary. So after tonight, I will resolve to be more funny and less...bloggy. But with this post, I want to reflect on a few things. Most of all, given the experience of yesterday evening, I am contemplating how much my life has changed in the last year or so. A lot of things that I used to be completely against (or, put another way, things I wanted to do but the thought of which completely freaked me out) are now almost routine. Routine might be a bit of an overstatement, but they do seem to happen with a certain ease that at one time would have been extremely disturbing. I've lived in Austin over a year now (official one-year anniversary: August 2nd); this is the first year of my life that I've lived on my own, "as an adult." I've supported myself financially, with very little help from my parents (and that was only recently); I've successfully completed a year of graduate school, with good grades; I've made good friends, had a lot of great experiences, traveled to London, and certainly I've learned a hell of a lot about myself. The question is, where do I go from here? How do I work on the things I see in myself that need improvement? How do I make more friends? How do I become more comfortable with the person I am and the person I'm becoming? How do I reconcile what I used to be, and what I always imagined myself becoming, with who I am, and who I want to be now? After all...who am I? And what do I want to be? And what is causing all this confusion? I know what you'll tell me...I need to loosen up, enjoy myself more, be more confident, and work harder to take control of my life. I know this is true. I need my life to move in a new direction...in any direction, period. I don't want to feel like I'm drifting anymore. And I don't want someone else to tell me how to do that...I want to figure it out for myself. But that doesn't mean I won't listen. I'm ready. What have you got to say?

       for the first time in my life i have lost faith in the ability of language to accurately convey meaning.  there is no way to describe in words the feeling i just had.  i don't know if that means i need to learn more words, or if i totally have to reevaluate everything i knew before.  it's like the sum total of all knowledge, of everything any human being could ever possibly know, only it doesn't feel like what you thought it would feel like.  it's not like knowing knowledge but acting it or being it, as if the laws of physics suddenly aren't just laws anymore: they are, they exist, they "be."  and that's what it's like: for the first time in your life you feel like what it feels to "feel."  it objectifies existence, lets you experience being not just as a fact of knowledge ("I am") but finally know just what that feels like.  all our knowledge is summed up in our language; we cannot have a thought except in words.  except this: this is what that felt like.  it was knowledge without words--the world beyond language.

       Today was a good day.  I only had to spend about two hours at work, since there wasn't much to do, so that meant I came home to take a really good, really long n-a-p.  It was much needed--maybe now I'm caught up on my sleep.  This evening, I went to  urlLink Shakespeare at Winedale  to see  The Tempest  with Laura, Jamie, Lena, and Lena's friend (whose name I can't remember, nor could I spell it if I did).  First of all, let's not kid ourselves...Winedale is a beautiful place.  The drive out took about an hour and a half, and parts of it were rural Texas at its best, including a few very charming little towns ( urlLink example : Round Top, pop. 77).  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Then there was the play itself, which is an incredible meditation on forgiveness, redemption, power, fantasy, reality, illusion, and theater.  It is, in other words, a typical Shakespearean play.  Since this one is thought to be his last, however, it always seems to resonate with deeper meanings: is Prospero a kind of double, a stand in for the playwright himself?  What does it mean, then, when he says of Caliban, "this thing of darkness I acknowledge mine?"  And what does it mean when Caliban says, "You taught me language, and my profit on't is I know how to curse!"  The actors were terrific too, especially Prospero, Caliban, and Ariel.  Those are probably the parts in which it is easiest to shine, but all three of the actors portraying the roles seem to have grown considerably since the last time I saw them, in Chekov's  The Cherry Orchard .  Anyhow, all in all it was a very enjoyable way to spend an evening; I'm only sorry I didn't also make it out so see  Macbeth --another of my favorite plays being performed this season.

       1) "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."— President George W. Bush in Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2004. Screwed up wars, exploding deficits, institutionalized discrimination, and a worsening environment...what could they possibly have in store next?  After the 2002 midterm elections, when Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill objected to another round of tax cuts for the rich, Vice President Cheney told O'Neill to discard his worries. We won the midterm elections, Cheney said. "This is our due." As much as liberals dislike President Bush's record over the past four years, it's the prospect of another four years that terrifies them. What they want to know—what keeps them awake at night—is what President Bush hasn't answered yet: What are you going to do next? This time, what will be your due? urlLink *   2) I for one believe in a right to  urlLink privacy .  3) Tomorrow night is Shakespeare at Winedale and  The Tempest , a great play which contains what is possibly my favorite line in the entire canon: "You taught me language, and my profit on't is I know how to curse."  These three thoughts, plus the poem, basically reflect the sum total of today's intellectual endeavours. Is that good or bad?--I don't know, but it probably needs I need more  urlLink Focusyne .

       Today I was so tired at work I almost slipped into silly mode: those of you who know me well are familiar with it. It's what happens when I don't get enough sleep: laughing uncontrollably at things that have little to no humorous value. It's remarkably similar to drunk Tim. It was so bad today the guy I work with, Edward, who hasn't seen me laugh much (let's face it, sheriffs aren't exactly the funniest guys in homeland security), had to ask me if I was OK...at which point I pretended there was some confusion over my assignment. I don't even remember what was so funny...  Tonight was the Ari Hest concert at  urlLink Stubb's . Allyn and Leslie are totally in love with him... You can see pictures  urlLink here  and decide for yourself. Dude is amazingly tall. He only played for about 30 minutes. It was great, but so hot! The venue at Stubb's is outside. There were a lot of people there, to see the act Ari was opening for: some middle aged guys known as the Finn Brothers, who are apparently from New Zealand (counterintuitively: I was hoping for some hot Finnish techno). There were lots of "kiwis" there; who knew there were so many in Austin. I guess it makes sense though...that sort of quasi-hippie vibe is probably pretty strong in both places. More proof that New Zealand is totally a "thing" right now. I swear the ghost of  urlLink Jerry Garcia  was there to check out the show...  Quote of the day* (in two parts):  Allyn: Yeah, that's my favorite job, putting things in my mouth...  Leslie: Yeah one time I got paid $75...  Me: Uncontrollable laughter.  *Like all good quotes, these lines are taken completely out of context.  PS: Leslie told me I have a svelte body! OK, she didn't really say that...but that's what I heard.  Out of nowhere:  *This weekend at my parents I found out I only weigh about 160 lbs (assuming their bathroom scale is right). Does this make me  urlLink anorexic ?  *I need to get tickets to  urlLink Austin City Limits , because apparently everyone I know is going.

       So the  urlLink Ari Hest  concert I was looking forward to tonight is actually taking place tomorrow, on Wednesday. I should seriously consider learning the days of the week. Or how to read things more carefully. So you can look forward to pics and thrilling Allyn stories tomorrow, instead of tonight. How I made that mistake is totally beyond me, but around 6:30 I had to call Allyn and say, hey remember that message I left you earlier about seeing you tonight, yeah well I actually meant tomorrow, since, you know, that's when the concert is actually taking place and you will actually be in town. Damn.  Otherwise tonight was great: I had a good talk with  urlLink Braden  on the phone, then went to dinner at Jamie &amp; Priya's and got to tell Amanda the big news (pencil in hand, of course). It was exciting, and not at all stressful, mostly because I trust Amanda and knew that she would be very accepting. Today's big lesson: I need to be more s-o-c-i-a-l. Say it with me kids!  Today's blog was brought to you by the letter S. And freshly sharpened pencils.

       Records from a typical day...  *Began by working at the worst job I have ever had: counting an endless stream of tiny airplane parts. Well, maybe the second worst job...no toilets were involved. However, I couldn't help but think, is this where my college degree will get me? A job that could be performed by a chimp with an average IQ and minimal training?  *An afternoon of the usual blah errands, followed by dinner followed by (what else?) an attempt to watch one of my West Wing DVDs, which proved to be really boring. You know there has to be a problem when the West Wing seems boring to me...what's going on?  *Drinks with my friend Paul at the Dog and Duck (and hence the title of this post). I didn't drink much, but it seemed to work quickly and effectively (hence the rambling nature of my writing). Paul and I talked  urlLink politics  and life in general here at the English dept, which leads me to my final question:  Should I leave the program after I get my Master's degree, move to an interesting  urlLink city  and live a couple of years in exile before I complete my education (probably by going to law school)? Or should I stick with the security of a monthly income and benefits for the next few years to finish my Ph.D.? Which will get me closer to my ultimate career  urlLink goal ? Should I wait and see who gets  urlLink elected  on November 2nd before I decide? What do you think?  Finally, tomorrow my friend Allyn is coming into town for an Ari Hest concert at Stubb's. I'm thrilled! Allyn is the funniest person I know! If your plane has to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, there's no one you would rather be sitting next to. Trust me. Look for pictures tomorrow...
