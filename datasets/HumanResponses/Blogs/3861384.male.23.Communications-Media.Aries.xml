      Man, do I want to see  urlLink the five hour workprint of Apocalypse Now .   Dennis Hopper gets killed, Martin Sheen stabs a baby, even more insane Marlon Brando babbling, and the opening scene lasts the entirety of "The End".   If somebody wants me to kill someone in order to get this, I gladly shall.

       urlLink Tism Short Film Competition   Oh yes, I shall make a TISM video clip, and it shall be good.  I read there have so far only been two entries with only two weeks left, which should mean less competition which could mean at least a nice runner-up position. I'll probably be doing an animation, just to see if I can. Not long to go though, better get started.

      Soon I will make a crap movie. I've made some before but this one will surpass both standards of crapness and hilarity that have not been set before. Even surpassing those set by my seminal work "diddie wa diddie.avi", a true classic of the abstract experimental 1930's music video genre if ever there was one. But you know, usually there's the whole problem of me getting motivated to go ahead and do it. But anyway, it'll probably be a shoddy film noir rip-off with appalling acting, costumes, sets and dialog. Just like Memento. LOL!

       I remember discovering that one of the worst things about puberty was this sudden unprecedented danger of accidentally sitting on my scrotum. See, it's almost impossible to sit on my dick by accident because it's been trained over countless years to occupy a specific area of my pants. My balls have no such decorum. They just go wherever they want.  This is why Al is our queen and overlord-for-life.

      Here are some things which are cool:   urlLink Noam Chomsky's Blog  That Chomsky guy is a pretty cool dude. While most leftist authors always go on about fighting the power and changing the world, Chomsky, in the words of the Onion A.V. Club, "...displays his ability to issue gloomy sociopolitical pronouncements with the ho-hum nonchalance of someone ordering Chinese food", speaking of which...   urlLink The Onion A.V. Club  The Onion itself is good enough, but I like this better.   urlLink Home of the Underdogs  Most computer games around today are boring and stupid, the many thousands here are not.    urlLink White Ninja Comics  Better than any User Friendly or Penny Arcade garbage for sure.

      Here we are on another one of those "blog" things I hear about so much in the talking pictures. But alas, my initial experiences have not been pleasant, as when I first went to register the ol' "pigscantfly.blogspot.com", I have discovered that some poor sod has made the unfortunate error of stealing it! WHAT HO!   Needless to say I was a bit miffed. Hopefully soon they will discover that I am the true heir to the moniker of PigsCantFly, as it was bestowed on me from god, and I was first to use it. If only there was some kind of online grounds in which a contested name could be fought out and decided fairly. But I digress.

       I had an interesting experience in the defecatorium (washroom) just now.  I commenced the procedure as prescribed by proper United Nations Shitting Guidelines: I gave a cursory inspection of the seat, lowered the pants and undergarments, sitting upon the bowl (inner seat down), and preparing to expell the defecant through the anal orifice.  Keep in mind, throughout the entire procedure, a seal between my buttocks and the seat remained just that - a seal.  Nothing could get in or out without being observed directly by me.  During the defecation, I noticed that the air was more "stank" than usual.  Stank usually isn't as acrid as it was in this case, due to the turds being safely underwater, preventing an odious escape.  Something's afoot, the Sherlock Holmes in me determined, but what?  What, I ask you?  I ASK YOU THIS NOW!  When I got up to wipe, I discovered much to my dismay that a rogue turd, not unlike George W. Bush * , had somehow wedged itself between the toilet seat and my buttocks, leaving its remains on both.  "WHA' HAPPEN'?" I screamed to myself.  I cleaned up, washed, and left.  So I put it to you: how did this happen?  I suspect one of the following hypotheses to be correct, but I'll need further supporting evidence, possibly by an eyewitness or two.    When shitting, I either passed out through my own accord or by some sort of poisoning.  Whilst passed out, a malevolent force, physical or otherwise, placed a turd upon the seat before arousing me from my slumber.  The Second Asshole Theory.  I have a hidden, separate rectum with no visible opening.  What triggers it?  I must replicate the events of the past two days to see if I can recreate the event.  This has happened to me before.  This time, I'm glad I noticed it before I pulled my pants up.   *   I couldn't resist.

        Apparently George W. Bush has retreated into a world of  urlLink depression, anger and paranoia  and is being treated with drugs for mental illness.  Far be it from me to laugh at  anyone's  suffering, even if it's as readily apparent as Bush's.  But what's bothersome about the article isn't that the "leader of the free-world" has probably found another drug addiction, but what employees of the White House have to go through as a result of his Nixonian paranoia:  “I was questioned about an email I sent out on my personal email account from home,” says one staffer. “When I asked how they got access to my personal email account, I was told that when I came to work at the White House I gave up any rights to privacy.”   Nice stuff.

        This is nice:  urlLink Matt Drudge  stole a photo that was taken by  urlLink Tom Tomorrow .  Not only did he steal it, but...  ...rather than just give a leftie cartoonist a small photo credit, he steals the picture and goes to the trouble of changing a red traffic light to green, flopping the image and altering traffic signs, all presumably in a clumsy attempt to give himself some sort of imagined plausible deniability.   Huh.  The worst part about it was he did a really bad job at doctoring it.   urlLink Take a look yourself .

        Multiculturalism, which claims to draw its roots from the same spirit of equality espoused by Dr. King, in fact has much deeper roots, going all the way back to identity politics and tribalism, and it is these trends which today challenge Canada both at home and abroad. They challenge Canada's democratic institutions, her identity, and her future as a single nation. Multiculturalism is the direct antithesis to Dr. King’s impassioned demand for equality.     urlLink Read More

        I found out from one of the creators of the  urlLink Team Barry Barnyard , an anti-Something Awful site, that people think I'm behind it.  We had a good chuckle about this, since I've spent an accumulated total of five minutes on Something Awful since 2001, and those times were just to check out and giggle on whatever huge drama explosion and spill-over onto IRC that was occuring.  I've looked over the site, and find the points they make are correct: SA was a good site at one time; Lowtax began to show contempt for it and its fans; Lowtax gave the keys to the forums over to a paranoid, anger-filled, failed humourist; These two starting "hiring" unfunny people to write updates and making enemies of talented and funny contributors; Eventually turned Something Awful from a place "where the smart go to be stupid to where the stupid go to be themselves".  When all the shit hit the fan in August of aught-one, those in the "IRC Illuminati" (a practical joke that played on Zack's paranoia) couldn't help but see themselves as Emmanuel Goldsteins: once close to Lowtax's Inner Party, then summarily dismissed and becoming a name to be invoked to identify any invisible enemy that may be attacking.  The mad masses merely regurgitate the party line without realizing it.  For those of you who weren't around for the great purge of 2001, here's what happened.  I had been a moderator for a lengthy period, for about 8-12 months.  I had administration privledges along with Lowtax, Artfag, Rainbow Blight, and Al.  The rules were a lot more relaxed then, designed primarily to prevent abuse of the system and harassment of other users.  I remember what the rules were like at the time, as I  urlLink wrote the original draft .  Rainbow and I had ideas to work on the community aspect of the forums, and Rainbow made a post asking what types of new forums some users would like to see.  Later in the say, she created some of these new forums.  In the short time they were active, they were being used and used properly.  Since the communication lines between all these administrators weren't too quick, I had the idea of creating a moderator-only forum, only seen by mods and admins, where reports on thread-locking and user-banning could be made.  This was inspired by a rather troublesome user who, while in an argument with me, was banned by another admin.  This user then complained to Lowtax, who would've reinstated him had he not started babbling about a conspiracy between Rainbow, Al and I.  The moderator-only idea fell through when a test forum I created ("kekeke ^___^") was visible to non-mods.  I was going to bring it up with Lowtax later on the proper settings to create the mod-only forum.  In the meantime, I deleted this extra forum.  Rainbow and I had the best in mind for the forums.  Unfortunately, others did not.  One user, named "Admin", wasn't supposed to be an administrator but was granted administrator privledges.  He took these undeserved privledges and created secret forums for himself and his friends.  This was where Lowtax's rage was focused, but, since there was no communication between the admins, he was unable to determine who did what and why and figured all the changes were by one unruly culprit.  He removed every single admin, save himself, as (was assured) a temporary precaution to sort everything out.  Then, out of nowhere, he grants his friend, Zack, administrator status.  Now the Lowtax I knew at this time was a funny guy who took his humour seriously.  He didn't want any flaws in his product.  Which is why this partisan move of giving a friend administrator status soley on him being a friend took everyone by surprise - not only was Zack unfunny, as evidenced by his failed humour e-zine  urlLink Geistmag , but, as was revealed, he seemed to have a chip on his shoulder and took everything personally.  Lowtax said to me at the time he had given up on the forums.  He wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  Any grievances I or others had were to be taken up with Zack.  Fair enough?  Not really.  You see, the problem was Zack was unable to listen to anyone.  He enjoyed being a dictator of the forums, banning people on a whim, which only angered people who were accustomed to fair moderation from a team.  When they protested, they were banned.  Nothing in the rules said what they were doing was bad, so the rules were simply ignored or rewritten.  I attempted to inform Lowtax many times that Zack was having a negative impact on the forums and was feeding Lowtax tales to justify his bannings, but Lowtax wouldn't listen.  He had given up.  He had contempt for the people on the forums (who were then starting to pay to have an audience with him), and Zack was a tool to express this contempt.  Who was exploiting whom here, we'll never know.  Users of the IRC channel #somethingawful were under the microscope for the longest time, as all the administrators and several old school posters were frequenters there.  Zack was certain that any attacks on Something Awful were originating from there, and had convinced Lowtax of this.  We had jokingly commented on Zack's paranoia in this channel that our "IRC Illuminati has to regain control to oust Zack".  Sure enough he was paranoid, as he knew about this right away (either through moles or being there under an unsuspecting alias) and users who said those lines were banned.  Yes, banned  on  the forums for something  outside  the forums.  A terrible precident that has set the tone to this day.  Then I was banned.  What grievous violation was I banned for - posting porn in GBS?  Posting the personal information of a user on the forums?  Links to Warez?  Nope.  As a sign of protest, I included "FYZ" in my signature, which stood for "Fuck you, Zack".  I didn't tell anyone what it meant, but Zack was surprisingly clever enough to figure out what it meant.  I also snuck it into a  urlLink Bob James cartoon  I made for the Ed Baker section of the site (which was taken down from SA on my request; look at the tombstone in the last panel).  That was August 2001.  That's the last time I posted on the forums.  I knew then they were without hope.  Aside from correcting the "official" history tidbit or reading the occasional flare-up, such as this, I haven't made comments on them anywhere.  And why should I?  All the good posters from the old school are gone.  It's gone from a fertile ground for breeding sharp satire to a cesspool of idiocy.  The most clever posters are gone, either having been banned or leaving out of disgust, as clever doesn't cut it in the new Something Awful.  In closing, here's a delectible booty.

        Yesterday afternoon I had an epiphany: the term  hot fudge sundae  would make a perfect name for a  urlLink depraved, offensive sexual practice .  But what, exactly?  I brought this up this evening when it was my turn to speak at the symposium (the same symposium that Stephen Hawking was speaking at earlier this week, by the way).  We've determined that a " hot fudge sundae " is the " bum-loving of a diarrhoetic ".  We must spread this term.  It's either this or  urlLink coit , so choose one and run with it.

       Stephen Hawking, that smart and handsome man, was  urlLink in the news  recently.  It got me to thinking about his appearance on  urlLink The Simpsons .  Since Prof. Hawking has no voice, did they wheel him into the studio and put a mic next to his voice synthesizer, or did they run his lines through any old synthesizer and just get permission to use his name and likeness?  That's far more profound than information escaping a black hole over aeons.

         For the longest time, I was a staunch supporter of Lindsay Lohan in the Lindsay Lohan/Hilary Duff wars.  The reason was that Lindsay seemed more mature than Hilary, what with her offering an olive branch after their public spat, and Lindsay just seemed cuter, so she was obviously correct in everything.  However, all that slowly began to change when viewing the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards.  Hilary came to Toronto to perform live for the crowd on John Street, and it was broadcasted live.  During her performance, she was wearing tight spandex bottoms -  sweet Jesus .  Not one straight male that got a good view of her buttocks in these things is no straight male I'd like to know.  A few days later, by chance, I was flipping through the channels and the Lizzy McGuire show, which made Hilary famous, was on.  I watched the whole thing.  Yes, the whole thing.  And I can't tell you what the plot of the episode was.  That's how enamoured I was by the way she looked in a pair of jeans she was wearing.  And now, previews for  A Cinderella Story  are flooding the airwaves, and my conversion is complete.  Lindsay Lohan is a cheap whore and Hilary Duff is the one of whom I'm waiting for a Playboy spread.  All I want is a girl that'll offer her ass up like a horny monkey.  Is that too much to ask?

       I have to say I am impressed with the Ontario Ministry of Health.  On Tuesday I called them, in addition to various other government bodies, to report my missing ID and to get a replacement.  The Ministrarian on the other end was very helpful, cancelling my Health Card and sending out a form for me to fill out and get a replacement.  After that, she asked if I reported any other missing ID, and I said "most of it, except for my birth certificate.  Their line is busy."  She said that line would be "busy forever and a day," since they only have one extension (!) and everyone in Ontario who has any issues whatsoever with their birth certificate will be calling it.  Nice.  Not to fear, she'll send out a replacement form for the birth certificate as well.  Today, both forms arrived, well ahead of all the other ministries I've contacted.  I'm impressed.  If you ever lose your health card, fear not.  It's just the other ministries that'll give you a hard time.

       Monday morning (midnight to 5:30) I was opping for the first time on  urlLink 102.1 The Edge .  No one heard it, however, since the transmitter was down.  Still, by law, the station has to play their playlist, so there I was controlling everything.  It was good practice I suppose - if I fucked up, no one would hear, not even the Program and Music Directors.  I did so well I'm doing it again from midnight to 5:30am ET tomorrow morning. The guy who's normally there is still suffering from a broken shoulder, and since I'm not on the schedule this week at  urlLink Mojo , I'm still earning part of a paycheque that'll go towards replacing my all my ID.  So listen tonight, either on 102.1 in the GTA or  urlLink online .

Nothing important was found, which leads me to believe that there could be some  LOL IDENTITY THEFT LOL  afoot.  So I called the appropriate numbers and cancelled what I could.  Everything else has an alert on it, so if it's used then those bigwigs down in the capital will know.  Replacements are being sent to me.  So there's a happy ending in the works.

       Further adventures from last night, courtesy of Dan:   I failed to mention one funny thing that happened last night...while we were at the subway station, i sat down on the floor to sulk about my injured ankle. I stretched my leg out, and was leaning on the wall. James attempted to jump over my out-stretched leg, lost his balance on the landing, and fell with full weight right onto the son-of-a-bitch!  This hurt A LOT, and while attempting to bury my head into my hands as I lay face down in the station, I ended up driving my nose into the floor pretty hard.  Good times.

        Sherlock Holmes did his best thinking when he was  urlLink high on cocaine . I do my best thinking when I'm not drunk or hungover.   I have been able to piece together the following:   I had my wallet with me when I was barely conscious in the alleyway.  I know this because every time someone would bother me and ask if I was okay, I would put my hand over the pocket after they walked off to ensure they hadn't pilfered it.  While conducting interrogations, it was revealed that, when I was carried to the cab, my friend Nicole went into my wallet to get some money to pay for the ride.  Following-up on this lead, Nicole informed me that she gave back the wallet when I was seated in the cab as, while sitting my pocket was inaccessible.   Ergo, it was in the cab that my wallet was separated from me.  It was not stolen by some low-life who took advantage of a barely-conscious twentysomething squatting in an alleyway by Yonge & Eglinton.  Next course of action would be to call the cab company and see if it was turned into their lost-and-found department.  Therein lies the problem: no one remembers the cab company.  What to do?  Since Toronto's taxi fleets all have uniform colours, I attempted to uncover what the colour scheme of the taxi was that ferried Dan and I to safety.  Only one person had a recollection, and that recollection was "silver".  Tomorrow, I will begin a quest - a sojourn, if thou wilt - to find out which Toronto cab company has silver cars.  This may result in a recovery of my wallet (sans  all  cash, undoubtedly), unless some unscrupulous fare found the wallet and felt my ID was worth selling to some shady folk.  I hope to Eris this will work.  If not, I may be unwittingly be making some undesirable purchases in Hong Kong in the near future.

       On Thursday, I was one of the lucky hundreds who managed to see a free preview of  I, Robot .  I can sum up the movie in one word-play on the title:  I, Impressed.  For an action movie starring Will Smith, it was surprisingly deep.  There were twists that were unexpected, important philisophical questions raised, and the movie was all wrapped up in a nice little package at the end.  The visuals were impressive, with computer-generated robots interacting seamlessly with actors and their environments.  It wasn't without its flaws, however.  The movie was set too close to the present in the year 2035.  I doubt, in 31 years, a high-speed highway tunnel will be built underneath Chicago to accomodate all the commuters to the new super-skyscrapers that redesign the cityscape.  Having the date unmentioned would have done just fine, and just have the movie set somewhere in the 21st century.  One thing that impressed me though was that the movie was relatively free of the  LOL BLACK PEOPLE LOL  jokes that were in Will Smith's movies in the past.  Aside from just one line ("This can't work out, you're a cat and I'm black"), race wasn't a factor in the movie.  If that line wasn't in it, then it would be a good achievement for Hollywood, where black people are no longer treated like minstrels.  These are hair-splitters however, but some crass commercialism can't go overlooked.  The protagonist, Detective Spooner (Will Smith), just happens to be a retro-freak - and, of course, his nostalgia happens to be centred on the early 21st century, specifically 2004.  That means many of the items he prominently displays for his fellow future friends happen to be in stores right now, including the Converse shoes and the JVC CD player.  What are the odds!?  This also leads to some predictible forced humour, where the technology-saturated Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) talks to the CD player in an attempt to get it to play.  C'mon.  I didn't exist when LPs were the primary medium for recordings, but I know you have to manually move the pin onto the record rather than wait for a hidden laser to start scanning the disc.  Given that these are the only flaws I noticed (and report here as a warning for impending eye-rolling), the movie was extremely well-written and well-executed.  The CG wasn't pointlessly excessive, existing only to enhance the visuals rather than take away or replace them.  All in all, it's a rarity when it comes to summer popcorn flicks: it's intelligent.    I HIGHLSLY RECOMEENDS IT!!

       Don't let  coit  become an  urlLink inkhorn term , use it liberally!   As a sidenote,  fatigate  is really nice.   Revive Fatigate!     One of these words,  attemptate , inspired me to create  attemptant , which is  one who attempts .  It's special.

        Coit  is my favourite non-word.  It's a non-word in that it's found in no dictionary, even though the English language is lacking in this term and requires it.   Coit  is the verb-form of  urlLink coitus .  Outside of  fuck , there is no one word, that is a verb, to describe sex.  However  fuck , verb-form or otherwise, is a bad word and is currently unacceptible to appear in medical journals and textbooks, or to be broadcasted on public airwaves outside of watershed hours.  A similar situation occurs with  faggot .  Compare it to  lesbian :  faggot  means a gay male, and  lesbian  means a gay female.  However,  faggot  is an offensive word, but  lesbian  isn't.  Since gay males don't have a single non-offensive term to apply to them only, they use the catch-all  gay  (as in the  urlLink Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamatation ) or  homosexual , even though these words apply to either gender.  So a verb-form for sexual congress is needed, and  coit  is what I endorse.  A non-offensive noun for a male homosexual is needed as well, but I have no ideas.  In any case it's irrelevant for me to try, as anything from a heterosexual male automatically becomes derogatory in that regard, whether it's intended or not.  I forget where I originally heard coit, but it's useful and needs to get into the dictionary.  Dictionary publishers such as Oxford operate under the philosophy that  urlLink English is democratic , so a word must be  urlLink used often and all over  before it's even considered for inclusion.  That means bizarre words or definitions that  urlLink Dyko  and I have invented have a long, uphill battle to go.  So use  coit  more often.  In fact, I highly recommend you go out and coit a person you find rather fetching.  Or, if you think I'm being stupid, you can just go and coit yourself, you faggot.

       An  LOL INTERNET FRIEND LOL  I know, named  cuntshitfucker , posted this with regards to a new study that finds circumcised men are more likely to contract STDs.    The whole pro-circumcision argument is silly really.   Women who prefer circumcised males are just as fucked in the head as men who prefer circumcised females. If women can make decisions about cutting up their son's wang, men should be able to make the same decisions for their daughters. What's good for the goose is good for the cunt too, I say.   Straight men who say "it looks better" should stop looking at other mens' penises altogether, or at least find a more rewarding hobby. I say "straight men" because I assume a dick's a dick to the gay crowd and the more there is of it the better (correct me if I'm wrong).   Then there's the "keeping it clean" argument. If you can't figure out how to clean your own rod then you probably have tard syndrome or penile dyslexia. Seriously, ejaculations are harder to clean up, at least if you're me. And ladies, don't start with the "oh but it's stinky and filthy and makes me want to throw up waaah" because quite frankly what you've got smells like a fried corpse and we don't really give a shit. Men don't go around telling you to cut bits of your festering frontbottom off, so just wipe the offending dong down with a sponge or something and suck down a nice steaming load of "shut the fuck up".   !  According to gay friends, being uncircumcised is vital to something called "docking", where the foreskin is pulled over the glans of another male. This pulled-over skin is then coited with. How anyone can support neonatal circumcision in light of this is beyond me.

       God damn racists.  Today, between where I get off the city bus and where I load my ass onto the subway, there were two men of a darker persuasion asking for donations, offering a photocopied booklet called  The Black History Guide .  I was in a hurry, so, getting off the bus, I glanced at what they were offering and walked on by.  The first man, who was closest to the bus and therefore the first person I passed, witnessed by glance, and very snidely remarked "yeah, you  would  walk by."  It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to gather that he was making a remark about my being of a lighter persuasion than he.  So I did what any subtle shit-disturber would do - I chatted with the equally dark-tinted man next to him about the booklet, and even made a donation in exchange for it.  I saw the first guy seeth as I wished the both of them a good day.  God damn racists.  In any case, it was a waste of money.  The cover says $5, and it's just about 6 photocopied pages of titles for further reading.  I'm glad this group was asking for  any  donation, justifying my loonie, as opposed to another group downtown that gave my boss a hard time for giving the same.  God damn racists.

       Good to see that not all US Republicans are of the neo-Conservative ilk who'd go mindlessly along with  urlLink Bush's red herring .   On Wednesday, 48 senators voted to bring the matter to a vote. But 50 other senators - including some Republicans - voted to continue debate. In effect, that puts off a vote until well past November's election.  President George Bush had proposed a constitutional amendment that would restrict marriage to a man and a woman. Constitutional amendments need 67 votes to pass the Senate. They also require approval by three-quarters of the states.  If marriage is so precious, what about a divorce ban, George? Why, not 50 years ago before America went on its "moral decline" divorce was scandalous and verboten, just like homosexuality. Surely you'd have no problem with being  consistent , right George?

       " urlLink Exactly 215 years ago today the French were revolting ".  Not much has changed (TEE HEE, I AM A WITTY PUNSTER).  Bastille Day is important day for those who are opposed to oppression.  It marked the end (albeit a symbolic end) of a tyrant's reign, permitting the populace to be free and allowing democracy to florish.  The French have a history of enlightenment and democracy, and always rattling the chains should these values be challenged.  No wonder many  urlLink propagandists  tend to have them in their scopes at every opportunity.

       On the night after our graduation, we all went out for a good ale-ing to celebrate our new-found "adult" status by getting drunk and making asses of ourselves.  On the bus ride to the Islington *  subway station, everyone except me came down with a case of Drunkard's Bladder, which is a severe disorder characterised by an overwhelming desire to expunge vast amounts of uric fluids from the body via the urethra.  There's no washroom on the bus.  There's no washroom in the subway station.  There's no washroom for at least a half-hour until we arrive at the tavern-of-choice.  Solution: find a shrubbery and kill-off a circle of grass.  Nicole, Serge, Jaclyn and Dan did just that, while I stood guard, preventing some Neds from getting too close to all the action.  Were it cool outside, a gentle steam would have arose.  Fast-forward to to-day.  This morning, whilst taking the trusty ol' Mississauga transit, I pass by the site of urination just across the road from the Islington subway.  What do I see, but a man, highly reminiscent of the late  urlLink Graham Chapman , puffing a pipe next to the bushes!  This is clearly sacred ground.    *   urlLink Dan  and I call it "The Isle of Ington" and giggle to ourselves.  No one gets it, which makes it funnier.

        Interesting thing about my MP I discovered a few weeks ago.  When I met him on election day I would've asked him about it, had I known, instead of just laughing.  I thought I'd share this discovery with you.  Take a look at  urlLink his profile  on the Liberal Party of Canada's website.  If you don't notice at first glance what it is that bothers me about the elected MP of  Mississauga-Streetsville , I'll spell it out for you:  He lives with his wife, a doctor of pathology at Rouge Valley Hospital, and son Omar in  North York .  That's right.  My MP doesn't even live in my riding.  Not even near my riding.  He's in a whole different city. Turns out Khan  urlLink was appointed by Paul Martin  to run the riding, forcing local MPs Carolyn " urlLink I hate the bastards " Parrish and Steve "I'm not as controversial" Mahoney to compete against each other right next door in Mississauga-Erindale.  Why was Kahn placed to run here?  I don't know.  How is he expected to represent Mississauga when he doesn't live here?  I don't know.  Maybe he's not supposed to.  Maybe he's just a vote in favour of all Liberal bills in the House of Commons, placed into a traditionally-strong Liberal riding while the controversial Parrish and the Chretien-supporting Mahoney fought over their next paycheque.  I don't know.  All I know is that I'm glad my vote didn't go to the Liberal Party, and, if strategies like these continue, it won't go to it for a very long time.

        Within the next little while,  urlLink The Edge  will be handing out free condoms in little packages.  The packages, on the front, will promote the Edge morning show and  urlLink Durex -brand condoms.  On the back, there'll be one of those Edge-style subway ads, which have a rambling, stream-of-thought dialogue on a green background.  It'll read something similar to this:  I gotta have safe sex.  If I was a rock star, I'd tell all my fans to have safe sex.  I could use this for some sort of sponsorship deal, where I'd get my own make of condoms.  It would be named something like the "Dr. Friendly 3000" and I'd be the official model for it.  Then I'd want to get out of the contract about a year in, because of creative differences, primarily because the condom has a stupid name.  I dunno.  I guess I'm on the Edge."  The person who named the condom?  Me.  The person who wrote the line about the name being stupid?  Me.  BOOOYAKA!  I'll scan 'em when they're done.

       From  urlLink CBC News :   U.S. President George W. Bush stands by his decision to invade Iraq, despite the release of a Senate report last week that was critical of pre-war intelligence on weapons of mass destruction.   What did you expect, for him to say "oops!" and ask for forgiveness for misleading his citizens?  The utter contempt this man has for his own citizenry is exposed not in that he willingly lied to them to bring them into a state of war, but that he's continuing to lie afterwards.  That the loudest of Americans agree with him doesn't make it too tough, though.  After a 10-hour beating, he could take a 5-lbs. shit in the open wounds on the chest of his most fanatic supporter and he'd still be praised.  It would be dubbed a "Patriot Shit", and people would want to touch it and send money to maintain the Patriot Shit.  Saddam was a bad guy.  A very bad guy.  If Bush made that case for war, then the support of the entire world which was his after September 11th wouldn't have dwindled to near nothingness.  No one called for Clinton's head after he waged war on  urlLink Milosevic  for that reason.  All Bush would've gotten, at worst, ambivalence instead of the sheer anger that is directed his way.  This isn't a "no new taxes" lie that his dad is famous for.  No one died as a direct result of Americans having to pay higher taxes.  Americans and Iraqis did die as a result of Bush Junior's lie.  And they will continue to die.

       Earlier in the week I was complaining that my jeans could not handle all the technology and items I need to lug around with me at all times - my cellphone in one pocket, my palm pilot in another, my wallet in another - I walk around with enlarged hips sticking out.  Sometimes my cellphone would slip down further and I'd look like I was smuggling a bone.  I lamented that it was socially unacceptable for men to carry purses, as that would be the most convenient solution to my paraphenalia woes.  However, whilst shopping for new clothes on Thursday, I bought my first ever pair of cargo pants.  Oh, how my life changed that fateful evening.  The pockets!  They're everywhere!  They're not to be found in a negative, hip-enhancing locale, as they're half-way down to my knee!  I can fit not only my wallet, my cellphone, and my palm pilot, but I can also fit things in that have yet to be invented.  They're also the kind that convert to a pair of shorts should the conditions require an immediate change.  I'm sure the detached legs could even fit in some of these pockets.  I may never have to change my clothes ever again with these self-changing pants.  Another boon is they're so fucking  comfortable .  You don't realize the slight tug jeans have had against your bag until you've slipped on one of these sumbitches.  And, although they're not tight, women look damn hot in them (provided they have a tight top on).  Levi's Jeans boasted in an ad a few years back that their jeans have been in style for hundreds of years.  Guess what?  Jeans are going the way of the Dodo, the velociraptor, and Christianity.  If you haven't obtained a pair yet, get cargo pants right now.  Steal them if necessary.  You'll thank me, your children will thank me, and your children's children will thank me.

       I have an  LOL INTERNET FRIEND LOL  named Al.  Al lives in the UK and is under probation.  I remember one tale about a drunk homeless guy rustling around in Al's backyard, so Al went out and stabbed him.  We all love Al.  Al recently dropped this gem:   I remember discovering that one of the worst things about puberty was this sudden unprecedented danger of accidentally sitting on my scrotum. See, it's almost impossible to sit on my dick by accident because it's been trained over countless years to occupy a specific area of my pants. My balls have no such decorum. They just go wherever they want.  We all love Al.   !  It has come to my attention by Mr. Al Derby hi'self that he's moved to Boston (which I assume is some sort of parole violation).  Therefore, he's escaped the Island of Foggy Rain that he resided on for these past 20+ years.

       Children.  Why anyone would want one of these ugly, stupid, snot-nosed, and loud little shits passed through their vagina and into their world forever is beyond me.  They're loud and have no grasp of how society functions.  Their numbers need to be thinned out, stiffly.  First of all, take the life-cycle of a child.  Before they're even alive they cause nothing but pandemonium.  A nice attractive woman who's willing to have sex gradually increases in size over a 9-month span, forever altering her body.  Then one day her vagina stretches to a size grand enough to permit passage of a watermelon as a soaking wet noise-machine passes through.  It's not quick - this parasite takes its good ol' time to end its uterine infestation.  Then it's nothing but a crying digestive tract for the longest time before becoming a  mobile  crying digestive tract.  It eventually starts to speak, but some of the things it says are the stupidest things ever.  And loud.  Eventually it'll bend the exclamation point at the end of all of its sentences and learn how to phrase a question.  Look out for that day, as you'll never have a moment of peace.  It's not just their ignorance that can be complained about.  They have a rudimentary intelligence that is also worthy of drawing ire.  When they start playing in the streets, for example, they have the cunning enough not to play in  busy  streets, thereby ending their pitiful existence for my benefit.  Their early teenage years are no better.  All the male of the teen-child species try to talk all manly and dangerous in spite of the fact their balls have yet to grow hair, and the female of the teen-child species are impressed by males who wear trucker hats at a stupid angle and buckle their belts around their knees.  Sadly, our human species has grown reliant on children to provide the next generation of humans.  Until we can break free of this yoke of oppression they have us under, I propose the following:  All male children are to be kept in stasis, educated through direct downloading of knowledge into their brain, until they are 18 years of age; all females, to 16 years of age.  The reason females can come out sooner is because they mature faster and, frankly, are hot at 16.  Aside from not having to deal with children anymore, soccer moms and paedophiles will also die out and disappear.  And that can't be anything but positive for the human race.

       Indulge me in a nerd moment for a moment, but this is how I feel the last 10 minutes of Star Wars: Episode III should go down.  We're a dark room of some sort, away from a major battle that is underway.  Padmé is in the room, lured there from the battle after hearing Anakin's pained voice (a force power similar to Obi-Wan distracting the stormtroopers in Ep IV).  The room is quiet.  The rumbling of the battle in the distance is nearly muted by the thick walls.  Padmé looks around.  "Anakin?  Anakin?  Where are you?"  Then, for the first time since the original trilogy, you hear the breath.  The chill that Padmé feels will be shared by every single person in the audience as every hair stands on end.  As she turns around, we see what she sees - Darth Vader.  His suit isn't complete - the helmet is missing, showing the exposed microchips and circuits from Ep VI.  His face is covered by the mask.  After some dialogue by James Earl Jones (I won't speculate here, but it will probably demand a hand-over of the newborn Luke), Obi-Wan comes in and a battle begins.  Obi and Vader somehow both get separated, which permits both of them to live - the fight will be merely paused, to finish decades later with Obi-Wan's death on the Death Star.  After a panicked meeting with any surviving Jedi, where everyone decides where to hide, the music begins to swirl.  His head away from the camera, we see a helmet, held by two withered hands, descend upon Vader's head.  As Vader stands up from his kneel, we see that they were the Emperor's hands.  As Vader takes his place next to the Emperor, we see this is inside a giant hall with a vast grouping of not Clone troopers, but  Storm  troopers, witnessing the ceremony.  With a wide-angle shot, they, in unison, turn around and start marching forward to impose the will of their leaders upon the universe.  Palpatine's cackling can be heard loudly underneath the music and the marching.  The last shot, which in Star Wars is always optimistic, is of the twins together in a crib of some sort with Leia, Obi-wan and (possibly) a ghostly Qui-Gon looking over them.  Eh?  Eh?  A fitting end, says I.  Tell me what you think.

Now that's a man who knows his days of the week.  I wonder what he's like on a Monday, emotion-wise - his he his same ol' bipolar self, or does he stick with one emotion longer like the rest of us, rather than cycling through so quickly?

        Lately, I've found myself going for lunch at a place near where I work called  urlLink Le Commensal .  It's a vegetarian cuisine restaurant.  Don't panic, I'm still a meat-eater, but this place is the only place where I can find affordable, fresh, take-out lasagne and grilled vegetables in the middle of downtown.  So far, my experiences there have been relatively flake-free.  You know what I mean, the stereotype vegetarian couple: a hippie-chick with unkempt hair and potatosackian clothes, with her whipped life-partner (male or female).  However, this evening, I saw something that just may possibly out-flake the flakes: two couples, both late-teen/early-twenty semigoths.  The women were what you'd expect, being black-clothed, emaciated, and pale-faced.  The men were the same, with the exception of one, who broke from the mould and actually had bleached his hair instead of dying it black.  He's an innovator, that one.  The other male I could only assume he was with one of the women romantically, as she was fawning over him.  It was plainly obvious he was gay.  He had the voice and the mannerisms and everything.  The only conclusive proof that was missing was him being sodomized right then and there at the buffet, but he could have very well been thinking about it.  Another amusing thing was that he was Asian, possibly from the land of the Orient.  An Asian goth.  Asian goths are funny.  I'm convinced I once saw a black goth, but my mind could have been playing tricks on me.  It's like the shower scene from Psycho: people are convinced the first time they watch it they saw the knife actually stab into the skin, but it never went in.  I'm convinced I once saw a black goth, but it's impossible.  So yeah.  The cashier I had happened to be a woman who was part of the Second City show I saw with Tori earlier in the week.  A neat coincidence.  It got me to thinking that I might go back with Tori there sometime, she likes seeing live comedy and so do I.  It works.  I'd bring her to  urlLink The Frantics  show later this month, but she's working the week after this one until Labour Day at  urlLink The Ex .  Bleh.  Maybe next time.

        I've come to a conclusion about something really profound.  Take the most troublesome, most warring, and most foul places in the world today - Iraq, Israel, Hamilton - and look at them on a map.  What do they all have in common?  They border water.  But they're just not some random port located any place on a body of water, they're all located at the most extreme places of water, where it begins to bend.  Iraq is on the western-most part of the Persian Gulf; to the north and south of the water, there's land.  Israel, the eastern-most part of the Mediterranean; to the south of the water, there's land.  Hamilton, the western-most part of Lake Ontario; north and south of the water, there's land.  Pulled together, I can hereby conclude that waters which form "armpits" of land are, indeed, the armpits of the world.

        [Nuns are] poor old dried-up women lying there on their solitary pallets yearning for Christ to come to them in a vision some night and take their maidenheads. By the time they realize he's not coming, it's no longer a maidenhead; it's a poor, sorry tent that nobody would be able to pierce -- even Jesus with his wooden staff. It's such a waste. --  urlLink Madalyn Murray O'Hair

        My date last night can be summed up with this quote from The Deer Hunter:  Fuckin' A!   The last half of the day at work I was beginning to get nervous.  I mean, this is the first real date I had been on in a long time, unless you count The Emily Disaster (which I don't).  During my furitive pacing, I had mentioned to trusty ol' Co-worker Pete that I was going to The Keg by Jarvis and Wellesly for a date.  "Ah, the Keg Mansion," he said.  "Nice.  When's your reservation for?"  "No reservation, we're just walking in," I said.  All the Kegs I've been to have been family restaurants, so this one was no different I thought.  Peter looked at me with dead seriousness.  "There's no way you're getting in," he said.  I made a quick call to the Keg Mansion, and sure enough they were booked solid for the evening.  Oh shit.  The date's ruined before it even started.  Luckily, however, in my research of Keg restaurants downtown I had noticed there was another Keg on Church Street, just south of Front.  I called them and asked if it was too late to make a reservation for that evening.  Not at all, my newfound saviour on the other end of the line said.  I made the reservations for two at six and all was set.  I called Tori and told her that instead of meeting at Wellesley Station we'd have to meet at Union.  No problem.  Phew.  When we met, I was nervous as hell.  I managed to make a decent first impression, as minutes later we were off to The Keg.  I had a fucking awesome steak and she had some sort of chicken/seafood deal that looked good.  Everything was going well; so well, in fact, she asked me half-way through the meal if I was interested in doing anything else after the meal.  Of course I was.  So, when we were finished our meal, we walked from Church Street to Blue Jay Way to catch a show at Second City.  Out of sheer luck, it was a free improv night, where Second City students got to show off their mad skizzles.  It was very good, these kids are gonna be STARS, I says!  When the show was over we walked up to Yonge & Dundas and went to Club 279.  We went there to hang out.  If I had my photo ID, we probably would have gone someplace less mulletheadish, but thems the breaks.  I have VIP access there and I know a few bartendrices, so we just breezed on in and had a few drinks while we talked.  After all of this, which was about six hours, we both said we enjoyed outselves, said we'd like to do it again, hugged, then parted.  A 10/10 evening.  A successful first date, and obviously the first of many.

        I want tits so big that they have smaller tits orbiting them. I want tits so huge that I can lick a nipple for 5 days, and run out of saliva before I get to the outer Areola. I want a chick with tits so fucking massive that we have to describe her bra size by creating new letters of the alphabet. I want a woman whose tits are so insanely out of proportion to her tiny body that people think she's headless and some kind of new "tits and twat" robot. I want a woman whose tits are big enough that I can sleep on one, and then in the middle of the night get up and go for a walk to the end of the nipple for a quick snack.

        I'm going on a date on Thursday.  It's been a long time since I've gone out with a lady, and that will come to an end in two days.  Her name is Tori.  I met her on an online dating service.  She's very cute, but her greatest feature is her sense of humour.  We've been quoting Simpsons and Family Guy back and forth non-stop ever since we first started talking.  We'll be meeting up and going to the Keg on Thursday.  Hopefully all will go well and there'll be other dates in the future.

        Towards the end of my overnight shift last night, I looked outside at 5:45am.  The sky had merely a tint of blue to it.  Night is lasting longer; summer is wrapping up.  How about that?  Before any decent summer weather begins, summer is leaving us.  This irritates me to no end.  I must dispatch a committee to study this and make recommendations.  Oh boy, here I go: a bag of mini pitas and a tub of Krino's Roasted Red Pepper spread.  Dear laurd, them's good eatin'.

        Should we really trust doctors?  When a doctor says "don't do this, it's bad for you," or "do this, it's good for you," should we really heed their words?  Their job, after all, relies on us not being well; so why do we think they have our best interests in mind when they try to make us "better"?

        I'm opping on  urlLink Q107  overnight, from midnight to 6am.  This is my first time doing such, so hopefully I won't fuck up.  This means I'll have opped for all three of the company's Toronto stations, meaning that I've completed my goal of becoming a Jack-of-all-trades around here.  I'm available for anything, which means cash.  I'm also available overnights, something no one wants to be, which will ensure a somewhat steady flow of pocketchange over the next little while.    !  Almost had a disaster there!  When I was edumacated in how to handle the switch-over from the remote op at the Hard Rock Café, everyone assumed normal settings would be active.  Turns out someone was tampering with the buttons, which (in as close-as-possible to lay terms I can get) diverted the program feed from the proper channel.  Oop!  Good thing I knew how to deal with the various feed buttons, so when I noticed it was shut off I fixed it right away.  Still, there was about 30 seconds of dead air, which seemed like an eternity.  Yikes!  I hope no one important was listening...   !!  And now the voice tracks are out of date!  At least that one's not my fault... even though I should have probably previewed it.  In other news, this is my most re-edited update ever.

        SHOUTING "OPA" DOESN'T MAKE YOU GREEK.  STOP IT.   !  On second thought, I'm not too keen on Greeks shouting it either.  It sounds as clichéd as an Hispaniard shouting "Olé".  Stop it as well.  Same with you Hispaniards.

        Ever since my dad built a deck in the backyard we've been having dinner outside on any day that it wasn't raining and below 20°C.  It's irritating.  I can understand eating outside if we barbecued food, but not when it's food cooked indoors and brought outside to eat.  Wind blows the napkins away and flies do their best to land on my food.  So today I sat down, got my food onto my plate, then took the plate indoors and ate inside like a civilized human while everyone else ate outside like protohumans.  Fuckin' savages.

        I woke up this morning with a sore left eye.  I discovered during the course of the day that I either have a pimple, sty or a bite  underneath  the lid, causing all my woes.  Damn.  From "Officers Weep" by Daniel Orozco, Harper's Magazine, June 2004:  3900 Block, Fairview Avenue. Shady Glen Retirement Apartments. Loudnoise complaint. "What kind of noise?" officers ask. Complainant simply says it was a "loud report". "A gunshot?" officers query. "A scream? Explosion? What?" Complainant becomes adamant, shakes walnut cane in fisted hand: "It was a loud report!" Officers mutter, reach for batons, then relent. Officers report report.   I saw an old man today that could easily fit the description of this old codger.  He had a cane and everything.  I suspect he had the cane to combat a symptom he appeared to have I named "Lazy foot", where his left foot was turned a good 45-60° off-centre.  I guess that would keep him from waving his cane about.  At least while standing.  Also, for the first time in my life, I found  urlLink a Chick Tract .  I have a bunch of them that someone I used to know named Zandra, a cult exit councillor in Florida, ordered for me.  They're a real hoot, but your laughter turns to sorrow when you realize people take this stuff seriously.  The Chick tract I found was a new one that I hadn't seen before, named  urlLink The Peace Maker . Unlike his other ones, this one had a relatively cohesive plot, and an unexpected turn halfway through (the officer being the man who helped the thug's grandmother).  Maybe they're keeping Jack out of the creative process these days, since he's becoming more and more... well, balls-to-the-wall retarded in his old age.  The back page had a stamp on it that showed the tract was distributed by the  urlLink Toronto Baptist Church .  I was amused that such conservative Baptists could be found in a progressive enclave such as Toronto, but looking at their website you can tell by the size of their church they don't have too many followers.  I guess that's what the tracts are for.  It's interesting that they chose a tract about LA gangs to distribute on Carbiana weekend.  What exactly are they saying about black people?  The extent of activity in Toronto's gangland consists of not saying "please" or "thank-you".  Stepping on the back of someone's shoe while they walk and not saying "sorry" is pushing it even for them.  One time I saw grafitti on the bus that said "CRIPS 4-EVR".  Someone scrawled underneath it "this isn't LA. You live in fucking  Canada ."  But hey, "it's Darkie Day downtown, so let's hand out tracts with black people in them! LOL I ARE A BAPTIST!!"  Going by this logic I'm surprised they just didn't hand  urlLink this one  out.    !  Not only do they deny fundamental science such as evolution, common amongst conservative Christians, but they even go as far as to make the bold leap that the earth is the centre of the solar system, the biblical basis of which even the most ardent Creationist tries to explain away.  I also took a shit today that was so big it hurt when it came out.
