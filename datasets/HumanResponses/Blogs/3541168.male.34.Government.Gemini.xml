      The night became day. Zoella decided which of the herd would pull her cart and together they began their journey. The village quickly fell behind them and they were surrounded by a broad prairie. She could see for miles in every direction for there was neither tree nor house to obstruct her view. Both air and land were flat and the dust hung about them like a cloud that followed Zoella on her journey. The prairie was empty; the path was meandering. A person can never feel at ease in a place without landmark or features and the same was true for Zoella. But like all things the prairie came to an end and in time she came to the mountains. Every step seemed more difficult than the last and the air became bitter cold. The mountains stood tall and aloof; the path was narrow and steep. If mountains were men it would be a lonely world indeed for they stand too tall and too proud. A person can never feel at ease among things so much larger than oneself and the same was true for Zoella. But like all things the mountains came to an end and a thick forest began at the mountains foot. Travelling through a forest is like coming to a large house and finding the door open and the lights out -- you're never certain when you're going to run into the owner. Like most forests it was dark with trees and the path was rough. Birds filled the wind with noise and the wind caused the trees to rustle. A person can never be at ease when they have no idea what's coming around the corner and the same was true for Zoella. But like all things the forest came to an end.   So it was with some relief that Zoella came to the walls of a great city. During all her travels the place that made her feel most at welcome was a wall designed to keep her out. It's very presence implied that people were expected here and the same could not be said for the prairie, the mountains, or the forest. Within the walls there was a gate and Zoella enterred the city. Her papers were stamped and she continued to travel for another day until she came to the palace at the city's center. It stood in a vast inner courtyard much like the prairie and the palace itself was a pale shadow of the mountains. All around it was a buzz of activity that reminded Zoella of the forest. She stood for a time and in her heart Zoella knew that the palace would be more difficult than her journey to get here. At the doors she and her goat were greeted by the palace guard and escorted into the apartments of Lord Andronico. Zoella spent the night in a guest bed under fine palace linen with her goat curled up beside her.

      In another time and a distant place there lived a young girl named Zoella. The boys of the village thought her plain-looking and the girls of the village thought her slow, but her parents knew the truth and loved her dearly. When Zoella was old enough her parents entrusted her with their greatest treasure and she became a herder of goats. Like most creatures with sharp horns, goats have a mind of their own and a girl barely taller than one doesn't so much herd them as they herd her. The oldest goats already know all about the best grazing areas, the alpine streams, and the dangerous things that lurk in the shadows. But the secret to herding well is that one quickly learns to be a better goat than they. Zoella was no exception. She took them to the places that a goat would be happy to be lead to and the herd followed because they were happiest where she was. So Zoella spent all her days in good company but as the months passed she became goat-wise and people-foolish.   The boys of the village now thought her wild and the girls of the village thought her mad, but her parents knew the truth and loved her dearly. Zoella was no longer a girl and had become a young woman. With heavy hearts her parents knew that the time had come for Zoella to leave their village and find a way of her own in this world. So late one night they sat at the foot of her bed and gave her simple advice for that was all they had to give. Her mother began with a worried expression and she told Zoella that she must always tell the truth. To which her father frowned and added, "But only tell as much of the truth as you need to." Her mother bit her lip and told Zoella that she must treat other people as she would have them treat her. To which her father frowned and added, "But there's no rule saying you have to treat with them at all." Her mother took Zoella's right hand and told her to be kind and generous to everyone. To which her father nodded and taking Zoella's left hand added, "Yourself included."   Her parents tucked her in and said that in the morning she could choose a goat to travel with her to the royal palace where she would stay with her uncle Andronico, an adviser to the king of their land.

      The king fixed his gaze on Zoella and then turned to one of his courtiers.&nbsp; He said something quietly and the courtier laughed, but the king did not. In his hands he held a golden scepter and a silver orb. His crown flashed warmly with rubies and diamonds. The king spoke slowly and addressed Zoella, "A small bird enters my court. What brings you here sparrow ?".   Zoella began to say that she had come to visit her uncle. But before the words could leave her lips she could feel the&nbsp;ring on her finger tighten painfully and she knew them to be untrue. "I've come because I outgrew my home. The village in which I was raised was too small for the woman I've become, my lord."   The king gestured around him with his scepter and asked, "How does the sparrow like my nest ? Are you being treated in a proper manner for a bird such as yourself ?" Zoella began to say that the palace was beautiful but the ring tightened on her finger and instead she said, "My village was too small&nbsp;yet the palace is too large. The manner in which people are treated seems unrelated to who they are, my lord." And with that a hush went through the king's courtiers.   There was a tense pause and then the chatter of quiet voices began to fill the audience hall. The king&nbsp;appeared thoughtful and quiet. He looked at the floor and then again at Zoella, "So will the sparrow fly to a more suitable nest or will she grow large enough to fill this one ?".   Zoella began to say that she would&nbsp;leave and soon&nbsp;but a powerful force stopped her and it wasn't the ring. She appeared thoughtful and quiet. She looked at the floor and then again at the king. "My lord, I don't know."   The king's chamberlain stepped in and assured his highness that an ambassador from a distant land stood&nbsp;waiting just outside the hall. The chamberlain gently took Zoella's arm and&nbsp;in a stately manner they walked to a side door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking straight ahead,&nbsp;he said, "The queen would have words with you". And with that&nbsp;Zoella became nervous. For in&nbsp;her small village&nbsp;the king had a reputation for owning the fox's cunning,&nbsp;yet it was&nbsp;his wife who had a reputation for owning the fox's claws and teeth.&nbsp;He knocked at the side door and they enterred the court of the queen.

      The same thing happened every day. At dusk Barnaby would come to look at the eggs, watch the goose arrive and then he would return home. But being wise in the ways of water fowl, it suddenly occurred to him one morning that he should follow the bird back to it's home. And this is exactly what he did. He slept in the grass and before sunrise the goose turned to the west and followed the dark night as it fled from the sky. Barnaby ran below it and kept the goose in his sights. After nearly an hour he came to a most unusual sight. In front of him was a ramshackle house in extreme disrepair and to one side was a massive beanstalk. About five feet up the beanstalk it split into two massive&nbsp;branches and a small plaque had been placed in the crook. Barnaby read it now. "Here stands the house of Jack the GiantKiller, legendary in beanstalk fame".   And remembering his favorite fairy tale, Barnaby began to climb the beanstalk with greed in his heart and a fever in his head. After many hours of difficult climbing he was high up among the clouds and before him stood a castle of giant proportions. He walked past the front gate into the castle proper and began wandering through its halls. The first place he came to was the kitchen and to Barnaby's horror he realized that he wasn't alone in the castle. Because looking through the cupboards was a very tall man on crutches. Despite how this man's height, Barnaby could scarcely be afraid of him.&nbsp;Years of hunger had cut him down to a proper size and he seemed wasted and thin. Could this really be the giant whose riches Jack had stole ? For he was now blind and crippled, searching through the cupboards of an empty home and unable to find so much as a stale crumb of bread to eat.   &nbsp;

      On his daily egg hunt Jack came across all manner of eggs: big and small, brown and white, green and blue. But on a fine summer morning when the sun was still low below the horizon, Jack came across the most unusual eggs he had ever seen. Nestled deep in a flattened bed of grass lay an egg twice the size of a ducks and four times as heavy. The shell was colored in fantastic patterns of bronze, silver and gold. As Barnaby raised the egg to his ear he could faintly hear a slow tick like that of a clock. His first thought was to give the egg to Gretta's chef in the hopes that she would choke on it but after further reflection he left the egg where it lay.   Now there are two great facts about eggs that Barnaby was well aware of. The first is that eggs are laid by birds. And the second is that generally the mother must keep them warm if they are to hatch. So Barnaby hid in the grass and waited for the bird who had laid this egg to return. The time passed slowly but Barnaby's patience was rewarded and just as dusk fell the most marvellous thing occurred. It began slowly with a quiet sound that soon became a dull roar and within minutes there was a loud recurring thud that was clearly the beating of wings. A dot on the horizon became larger and larger, and soon Barnaby could see a large golden goose. The light from the setting sun reflected off the feathers of the bird and as it came closer Barnaby realized that the goose wasn't golden but instead had feathers whose color was a burning pure white.

      Barnaby lived n the house of his stepmother and his father lived with them. Under different circumstances his father might have been called hen-pecked. But living in the house of his wife he had little authority. The "hen" never pecked him but instead gave closely worded orders that were promptly obeyed. And with that Barnaby's father can be dismissed from further mention until much later in this story.   Like most children Barnaby had chores that occupied a great deal of his time. His hardest chore involved the gathering of eggs. His stepmother, Gretta, was legendary for her extremely refined sense of taste and could only stomach the eggs of ducks. While it is true that ducks love sleeping in a nice warm barn, they are far too intelligent to lay their eggs in one. In fact ducks are the most intelligent of fowl and typically Jack's ducks flew several miles away to hatch their brood. Faced with an empty barn Gretta instructed Jack to scour the fields of their farm manor and this is exactly how Jack spent most of his time. He did indeed find eggs. They were of a rather questionable parentage and whatever they may have been they weren't from a duck. But after&nbsp;being fried, scrambled or poached, Gretta was none the wiser.

      When she awoke she explored her new surroundings and was surprised to find that she was alone. On a table by the window were three items: a scrap of parchment, a ring, and a pair of spectacles. She looked at each in turn. The parchment had her uncle's handwriting on it and she began to read:    "My dearest Zoellerina,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your parents have sent word of your coming but I will be unable to greet you for many days. The palace can be a difficult place for one so young and I have left you two tools that I hope shall make your stay here easier. One is an enchanted ring that when worn enables you to only speak the truth. The other is a pair of magic spectacles that will allow you to see other people as they see themselves. The first will fill your words with truth when you speak and the second will ensure you do so kindly. I came to the palace at the same age as you and was given these very items by a kind soul. Now I pass them onto you. But every gift has a price and there is something that I must ask of you. Our king was once noble and generous until long ago he suffered a great wound. To this very day it has never healed and although I am one of the king's greatest advisers I am unable to help. But I believe that if you follow your heart it is within your power to heal the king. I shall return to you when I can and I send all my love.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your uncle, Andronico"   With that she looked at the ring carefully and saw that it was made of silver and it's surface carved into the shape of a grape vine. She put the ring on her finger and picked up the spectacles. They were slender and the lenses were the color of roses. She put them on as well and she could feel no difference either within or outside herself.   There was a knock on the door and a page enterred the room. He seemed tall, handsome and kind. Zoella removed her glasses and behold. The page was short, plain, and while not rude his spirit was small. The page informed her that the king would grant Zoella an audience in the evening. It would take her all day to prepare and the page introduced her to a noble dame that would attend her. A young woman stepped into the room dressed in clothes adorned in pearl and silver. On her head was a fine coronet of gold. Zoella removed her glasses and behold. The dame was withered with age and her clothes were shabby with wear. She spent several hours clothing Zoella and training her in the proper etiquette. She was introduced to several people and the results were always the same. They seemed magnificent and enchanting with the glasses on but once the glasses were removed they were less so. In time they were done and she set off to see the king.   In the center of the palace was the largest door Zoella had ever seen and the royal chamberlain walked her into the king's audience chambers. His royal highness was not as she had expected. He was ancient. His hair was white and his face pale as if all the color had been bleached out of him. He looked brittle and frail. Zoella removed her glasses and behold. This man was no older than her own father. He sat in his throne seeming proud, haughty and strong. She was perplexed and didn't understand the meaning of what she had seen.

      Right after our first date, my wife sent me an email to let me know she had strong feelings for me. This was my reply.    "Ditto. I was going to write you this long creative fairy tale about an owl that falls in love with a crow at a tea-house. They have all these cool adventures ... the owl shows the crow the night, and the crow shows the owl the day. But eventually they both migrate in opposite directions and wind up going their own way. The crow resumes collecting shiny objects and the owl resumes hunting mice and they die bitter, lonely and sad ... strangely they are both killed by hawks. But your way is much, much easier. I like you too."

      I want to tear my life apart, dissolve it in alcohol and tell everything I ever considered precious to go to goddamn hell. I've been a decent person. I've gone out of my way to avoid hurting anyone and what the fuck has it ever got me. All the decisions I've made over the last ten years were the ones I thought I could be proud of and the sum of it all is that I'm going to be left holding my cock in my hand. I wish I could start this life again. I wish I could take another road.  I'm not in the least bit suicidal and you know why ... the thing that really gives me room for thought ? Who's going to welcome me on the other side. I'm sure I'll get the generic greeters with a plastic smile on their face and a weak sweaty handshake. Because all the women that were most meaningful to me in my life decided not to stick around and what does that leave me with ... no one but the goddamn welcoming committee and a fucking fruit basket. To hell with them. Sigh.  "But other than that Ms. Lincoln, how was the play ?"

      Side effects may include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loose stool, and the removal of social inhibitions. At 5:17pm yesterday (Wednesday June 17th) I found myself sitting in my car. Hands gripping the wheel. I should have driven to class. I should have sat for 3 hours and 15 minutes and edumacated myself about accounting. But I just couldn't do it. I drove to the BART and went to San Francisco. I had gotten an email offer for a big marketing event in the city to promote the consumption of Guinness. Have they had difficulty selling it here ? Maybe Budweiser and Coors are cutting into their profit margins. Anyhow I became a "GUINNESS BELIEVER" and went to their event in the Merchant Exchange Building.   Surprisingly I had an incredible time. I talked for quite awhile with several complete strangers and I was at the top of my form. Relaxed, funny, pleasant. The insecure little emotional dwarf that I am around my wife completely disappeared. Is it redundant to say little and dwarf together ? Probably. After the event ended I tried to meet up with this drinking club that meets at dive bars in SF on week day nights. After two hours of trying to consume as much Guinness as I could stomach, I stumbled over to Market street trying to find a dive bar called Judi's something something. Eventually I found this no-name-bar in a very seedy neighborhood. Eureka. I get in and after embarrassing myself at a few tables trying to find the group, I just sat at the bar.   I had a great conversation with two women and this guy. One of the women was a little too friendly. At first I thought she was just a "close talker". But then she put her hand on my knee. I had been telling them the saga of The Shotgun Groom and she looked spell bound. Maybe it was just a sign of support ? I adjusted my seat - access to knee removed. And we kept on talking. At the end we pleasantly exchanged cell phone numbers. Which was a big mistake because she actually called me around 5am on my cell. Drunk of course. I'm just looking for friends ... without benefits. Also while she wasn't ugly per se, her personality could be described as a bit troll-like and brutish. In any case everyone shared their sob stories. The guy was very witty. It was great. I got home sometime after 11pm.   The call on my cell phone woke up my wife. I explained what had happened that night and she didn't seem upset in any way. Neither of us could get to sleep afterwards so we wound up chatting just a bit. I really enjoy her company when we're both relaxed and chatting freely. But a bit later I could feel the dwarf coming out of his box. You know, the little one ? The one who treasures his slightly crazy wife and feels overwhelmed by everything that's going on between us ?? I left for work. The first few hours of work are usually horrible. I always want to solve all my problems at once and it's difficult to take my mind off the troubles in front of me. Which makes this whole situation much messier.

      Not a high quality designer donut. I'm half-baked with too much glaze and most of my jelly is oozing out the side. And it really, really hurts. To make matters worse this donut is now 34 years old as of this Sunday.   My wife is such a trooper. On Saturday she let me take her to an event in San Francisco but it went horribly wrong. During the drive back to our apartment she broke up crying completely out of the blue. She used to be part of the same creative crowd that had put on the event and to contrast that with the life she leads now is crushing for her -- almost five months pregnant, living out in the burbs, and with a clumsy awkward guy who inevitably seems to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. The drive back to our apartment was long. She couldn't talk about what was going on inside of her and I rambled on during the entire trip trying to fill an empty void. I did everything I could to try and convince her that she could make her life take any shape she wanted it to ... to convince her that she may feel stuck in a hole but that there were so many ways out. Hmmmm. Or atleast there were a few ways that she could rearrange her hole so that it wasn't so deep. I tried to let her know that I would support her in any decision or plan that she came up with. Even if that plan didn't involve me. It's still painful to think about that.  My actual birthday was on Sunday and despite everything my wife was very kind. I know she had been feeling exhausted and depressed all week but she still found the energy to get me a small gift, take me out to breakfast, and surprise me with a cake. I feel like something of a cad to be so absorbed in my own emotional problems. I know that there's a lot about her that I don't get. All I can do is pretend I'm OK and desperately grasp at the few things that I do pick up. She keeps her cards to herself and it seems like her emotions are for her and only her. Please someone, lend me a clue.

      Sigh, yesterday I broke down and wrote my wife a note telling her how much I love her. I wanted to tell her in person so badly. I wanted to look into her eyes and explain how much she means to me. But I couldn't bridge the gap. I wrote her a letter instead. Why is it so difficult for me to talk with her face-to-face ? I've never been this way before. A part of it is just that I know she's planning to move at the start of the next year ... as soon as she has the cash. It's taken some of the wind out of my natural cockiness. I'm so emotionally charged around my wife that I feel dry, mechanical, and witless.   But I'm glad I found some way to unravel my feelings. I wish I could be there when she lets her creative spirit flourish. I had looked forward to our marriage as a happy partnership where our creativity and natural playfulness bounced off each other ... where we raised a kid who would get to see the best of both our worlds.   Among all the people that have passed in and out of my revolving door heart, the person that I miss most is my first wife. When she held me in her arms, I could feel her love like a warmth that spread all through me from head to toes. She made me feel needed and desired in a way that was unconditional. Unconditional love is considered remarkably passe these days. I think the San Francisco ideal is a large pool of "friends with benefits". I hardly have the right to complain. I'm rotten about keeping in touch with people. And I stabbed my first wife in the back so many times I'm sure she lost count. Ultimately I drove her away in as slow, deliberate, and cruel a manner as possible. And I still hate myself for that. It's why I've become the exact opposite person today.  Close friends, romantic or otherwise, are difficult to come by. Speaking of which, I miss some of the friends that I had in the Navy. Like Simon. I remember when his mother passed away from cancer and when he came back from the psychiatric facility in Bahrain with all his hopes and ideals about the Navy completely smashed. Or the way it felt when I was stranded for months at sea among people I despise ... and then pulled into port and saw my good friend Scott. Going through hard times is what really brings people together. "Connection" is something that just comes naturally as the months pass into years and you share parts of your life with someone. At the very least I know that my wife's pregnancy is going to bring us closer together.

      Did I mention that my wife is giving birth to an angry fetus trapped in a small enclosed space within her midsection ? During last month's ultrasound we could actually watch as it shook it's enraged little fists. And this month the technician confirmed that the feet kicking my wife's intestines are now about an inch and a half long ... and female. It's going to be five more months before I get to meet her but I get the impression that we're going to have our hands full. How many difficult pregnancies could be successfully treated through the use of ADD medication - or by installing uterine televisions ?  In any case I had a relatively good weekend with my wife. Friday was great and so was Saturday. She always seems more herself in the morning and it helps to be as far away from the apartment in Dublin as possible. I've been trying to coax her out into S.F for a couple of weeks now but it's difficult finding the right "bait. She works in the city so driving there on the weekend isn't very attractive. And she usually has to get up fairly early so energy on week nights is limited. But I think getting out more would help the way things are between us ... even if it's just a walk in a local park. I still worry constantly about what's going to happen after the baby is born. The most important thing is that I want her to be happy. I want to be around that girl I met at the Blue Grass Festival last year. The one with the sharp sense of humor and quick-wit ? The one who felt so in control of her life that she abandoned her plans to move away from the Bay Area, married me on the spot, and agreed to beget my accursed hell-spawn ( with the cloven hooves ) ?

      It began with an email reply to a Craigslist personals ad. My subject line read "Fossils Show Evidence Of Ancient Plants" and I took it directly from a news item on Yahoo! at the time. I ended the first date surprised that I had wormed my way into her bed and by the third date we were trying to have a kid. Marriage followed about three weeks later. And where the hell are we now ? I'm lost on that one. There isn't a map and the compass keeps moving. We're five months into the Bermuda Triangle of pregnancy and I'm beginning to have serious doubts that we're going to come out the other side. She's still the dearest thing in the world to me ... but she's unhappy, equally unsure where this is all going, and a lot of the time it feels like she's about five thousand miles away. Only a fool would have expected this to be easy. But hey, even the consolation prize is worth more than anything else in my life. At the end of four months I'm going to be a Dad. My own father died of a heroin overdose when I was fourteen. Before that he was the most inept long distance father imaginable. I'll be everything he wasn't even if I have to do it with one-hand tied behind my back. Tomorrow we learn if it's a boy or a girl ... and in the months ahead you'll find out whether I sink or swim as a husband. Stay tuned.

      It's OK for the "man" to keep me down but this whole boot on the neck thing is just too much. There were Funyuns in the vending machine today. Golden delicious artificially onion-flavored Funyuns. I placed my dollars worth of change into the machine and tearfully selected option A1. The big metal coil began to turn and I could see the bag getting closer ... closer ... and then the coil stopped with the bag still firmly lodged in place. "No snacks for you, nig". But fucking mouth tease is gonna learn homey don't play this shit. I thought about tilting the machine and then remembered all those funny email postings about people crushed by vending machines. The stick figure diagram on the front of the machine reminded me. Shit they know this happens all the fucking time, don't they ?   I wrote down the emergency service number and went over to the public lab phone. These byatches gonna feel my pimp hand. An Asian cutie pie in a lab coat walked past me but I didn't check her out. The "man" is watching, recording. I look down at the linoleum floor. Eye contact bad.&nbsp;I pick up the phone and dial the number. After three rings they pick up. Some old woman tries to give me her customer service "May I help you" hand job. Do they really think this is going to satisfy me ?&nbsp;That's some fucked up shit. I hang up before saying anything. I take a deep breath. There's no way they can repay me for this hell. And I have a bag of Doritos at my desk. Asian cutie pie is now returning to her office. But this time I'm giving the finger to the "man". I don't care if he or his recording machines are watching, recording. My oh my. Daddy LIKE. This chick has a drool worthy ass. And is carrying two bags of Funyuns.

      Ever have the feeling that the screenwriters responsible for your life have been poked in the ass with a sharp stick and are now typing away schizo-frenetically&nbsp;to produce a happy ending for the final episode&nbsp;? They've been asleep all fucking season and the actors have been&nbsp;making shit up in order to get by. But now it's Christmas at the actors guild and Santa's little elves have been busy drinking and hammering out toys all year long.&nbsp;I came back to my apartment and for the first time in several days it didn't feel empty. It just stunk of cat shit. This is something I can clean up. This is something that's within my power to change and everything will smell good in the end.

      I only had a dollar for lunch today. I walked over to the vending machine in the biosciences area near all the contamination lockers. It was completely out of Funyuns. If I can't have Funyuns I don't want to eat and it's so not fair. I started kicking and punching&nbsp;the machine&nbsp;but one person seven doors down turned his head and gave me a brief curious glance. Then looked away. The "man" is really keeping me down. I returned to my office and resumed listening to gangster rap.

       urlLink    Late one night while attempting to ensure that my wife could eat a well lubricated breakfast cereal on the following morn, I made a quick run into Safeway. I passed by a disturbing and enigmatic package on a closed register. In mortal terror I returned to my apartment and borrowed my wife's digital cameral. With sweat on my brow and pee in my pants, I took a stealthy shot of the package and I share it with my readers now. God save us all.&nbsp; urlLink

      I was feeling on top of the world yesterday and now I feel like the world is steam rolling over me.&nbsp;I had dinner with a friend in Albany tonite&nbsp;but now I'm back at the apartment. It just feels oppressive and empty. When does tomorrow begin and yesterday end ? I'm&nbsp;alone&nbsp;in this place&nbsp;and that hasn't happened too often of late.&nbsp;I used to be able to do so many things when I was alone. But my skills have withered and my magic&nbsp;has all but left me. I pick up my Tarot cards and&nbsp;go over to the bed where I can't hurt myself.&nbsp;I lay the cards out face down so I can only see their backs. I hold my breath. This always takes forever and a day. At first there are flashes of light and it hurts like a mother fucker.&nbsp;More than it used to. Things get dark and I can hear my heart beat&nbsp;so loudly that it scares me. It's the&nbsp;ONLY thing I can hear.  &nbsp;  In front of me is something huge&nbsp;and invisible. I can almost feel it bearing down on me&nbsp;yet it's a long way off. I have a lot of time. It's a cup. I can't see it but I know it's&nbsp;a gigantic cup. I feel like I'm pouring all of myself into it and the feeling is intensely sexual. My whole body is throbbing but I'm totally passive. It's as if all of me was flowing into the cup and I'm dying. It's getting closer and my arms are wrapped around it. I'm trying to play a song on one of the most beautiful guitars I've ever seen.&nbsp;Every time I try to play a chord, the guitar plays notes of its own. This isn't my song and what we're doing is like fingers on a chalkboard. I can see there's a crack in the guitar and all of the music is flowing out onto the floor. I look down at my fingers and they're bleeding because the strings are razor sharp. I drop&nbsp;the&nbsp;guitar&nbsp;and I'm not sure what happens. The pain is incredible. I can't take the pain. I can see a woman's arm and she's holding a sword. She's offering it to me. It's bright and shiny. Razor sharp. I can imagine how it would feel in my hand and the weight is seductive. I long for the sword. I know that if I take it, all&nbsp;my pain will become the pain of others and all my happiness will leave me. I hesitate before accepting and the offer is withdrawn.  &nbsp;  I start coughing and I realize I'm face down on the bed. My right hand, the hand where I've sharpened my fingernails to play the guitar, really is bleeding. I must have been&nbsp;clenching my hand so tightly that I broke the skin. As always there's a mess in my pants.&nbsp;I have a horrible headache. I think this will be the last time I am able to do this.&nbsp;I turn over the cards on the bed.&nbsp;The prince of&nbsp;wands. Two of cups. Two of swords. The major arcana have deserted me. There will be two. Two children. The second will hurt far far worse than the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      and now has it's own blog at  Zoellerina .  Part two is up but I've had a tough time with part three. My creative muse eventually came through but as a result I need to rework the second portion. I've been calling the whole story "The King and His Clockwork Son" so that should give you a hint about where I'm going with this ...

       Looking Ahead Backwards    Long road trips are often filled with spells of grogginess, dissociation and intense impatience. Travelling as fast as you can with a single destination in mind and knowing that the end of your trip is still several hours away can flood you with a restless feeling, a dissatisfaction that erases any sense of the progress you've made ... as you whiz by other cars at almost a hundred miles per hour. So a road trip is the perfect metaphor for my life right now.  On Thursday I was at the top of the world and I really felt at peace. I was focussed on the life I'll have several months from now after I get rid of all the "debris" from my current one. But by Friday I could feel myself getting caught up in the here and now. I knew that if I didn't get out of the apartment things would only go downhill emotionally. So on Friday night after hanging out with friends in San Francisco, I got in my car and drove to San Diego. The time that I spent with my wife last weekend was awesome. But I knew that even if we had another great weekend together it would be like throwing gasoline on the fire ... there's a part of me that's going to get hurt no matter what. I needed to put all my attention on some other part of my life and a road trip seemed perfect.   Inside Aunt Jane   I made it to San Diego in eight hours with only a tank and a half of gas and an hour of sleep at a makeshift "rest station" ( read: pulled over on the side of the road in the wee hours of the early morning ). The check-in time at the hostel wasn't until 2pm so I had a lot of time to kill. I got onto the trolley and took a trip to Tijuana. Does Tijuana actually mean something as a name ? What if it's some shortened form of "Tia Juana" that would make for a number of interesting stories since it translates as "Aunt Jane". For most people in the U.S. the word Tijuana is synonymous with dirt, squalor, and a tourist industry that caters to Americans looking for both. I took a taxi over to Avenida de Revolucion in order to do some shopping. I think it's mandatory that most large cities have an area dedicated to quarantining obnoxious foreigners and Revolucion is just such a place.     Made In Mexico, Poorly But With Great Pride    But I actually had a fun time shopping. One of the annoying things about Spain is that after about two hours of "tourista shopping" you had a complete inventory of all the items that you're likely to find in such shops across Spain. There are the leather items and metal work from Toledo, the fans from Seville, the gold filigree work from Granada. And all the little shops are buying from the same suppliers in China. This is the real miracle of outsourcing: everything everywhere looks like everything else. But Tijuana is different.    Obscene Shopping Fun   Part of the reason is that Mexicans are selling crap that's so bad, the items couldn't even find their way into a street stand in Madrid. Everyone is familiar with American kitsch, right ? Well rural Mexicans certainly are and when you combine that with some mediocre paper mache skills and a keen interest in an American buck ... you have a recipe for obscene shopping fun. Some of my personal favorites include the very poorly made life size reproductions of Spider Man, Bat Man, and miraculously the Green Lantern. Or the vendors with burros painted with prison stripes so that American tourists could take pictures of themselves "in Tijuana". I'm pretty sure that with a polaroid camera and a Mexican flag, I could make an outrageous fortune by charging drunk tourists for the opportunity to take pictures of themselves peeing on the pride of Mexico.  Now don't get me wrong. There were a handful of rather nice shops including one that sold reproductions of well known Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec artifacts. There was also another shop that sold things with a "Day of the Dead" theme. I distinctly remember one rather nice skeleton puppet: it was bright white and had a giant pink penis. I'd like to think that this was the artist's way of saying that in the end we're all fucked by death. If so, the statement was wasted on the marines from Camp Pendleton who actually bought it. I focussed on shopping for that soon to be light of my life, Zoe. I bought two slightly ridiculous dresses that probably won't fit her for five years and I called it a day. One was a little flamenco dancer outfit and when I returned home, I realized that the skirt portion was attached to the dress by eight extremely large, sharp pins. Perfect for a small toddler ...   I Worship Ochango   The trip back was living hell. It took forty-five minutes to get through customs and the trolley to San Diego was packed. I did have one interesting experience though. A young Mexican-American asked me if I had accepted Jesus Christ as my saviour. What does one say to that ? It happens all the time but I'm never ready for it. And I'm rotten at improv. I thought very hard very quickly and responded with "Who ?". I then explained in two or three-word sentences with the worst fake Dutch accent I could muster that I was from South Africa. The kid asked me if there were churches in South Africa and I told him that we only had temples. So who do you worship ? Ochango ! He seemed very confused and proceeded to ask six or seven more questions about South Africa, ending in a "I thought everyone there was black" ( with a disturbing little snicker at the end ). The only other high point in the conversation was when I asked him if he had children. He was only sixteen and looked at me with a slightly horrified expression. He shook his head then asked me the same. I told him that I had six children. His response said alot ... "Ohhh, the cost of living must be very cheap there." Smart kid.   Underneath The Thin Veneer of Grime Is More Of Same   I returned to the hostel and proceeded to sleep until about 6pm. I woke up just as some kid was checking into my dormitory style room. He looked about 22 years old and the first thing he did was pin up a giant poster of his girlfriend on the only available patch of wall space. As I think about it now, the poster was in direct view of his bed so maybe he had put it up for reasons that weren't purely sentimental. I showered and immediately headed back to Tijuana. My experience of the city was entirely different by evening. Side streets that had been deserted in the morning were now jam packed with natives out for their afternoon stroll. This was when I really began to love the city. I had more fun people watching in five minutes than I usually have in a week in San Francisco. A scam is taking place on every street corner. Look to the right, there's an old man who just shouted something to a group of teenage girls that would have gotten him arrested in California. Look to the left, there's a woman dressed like a whore and she just handed her baby to some guy. I'm pretty sure the last thing she said was "trabajo en calle" and then she blew him a kiss.   Tijuana is one giant seamy underside without censor or pretense. Best of all you can walk one block away from a tourist trap and not see a single gringo for hours. Sure most of it is shabby and there are a couple of streets that made me want to pee in my pants out of sheer fear. But it's actually one of Mexico's richest urban centers and over a hundred thousand people call it home.    Mexico: Where The Boundaries Blur   I was amazed by the number of children out with their parents. People seemed surrounded by kids like flies. Every woman that I saw in their mid-20s had two or three children in tow. And each little shop seemed to double as an alternative day care center. It seemed like the wall that separates personal life from work is very thin for most people in Mexico and after working at a huge lab for seven years I'm drooling with envy. I spent atleast two hours soaking up the city and it's sights. Finally starved out of my wits, I broke down and got a taco from a street vendor. I handed him a dollar which he promptly put in his pocket and then with the same bare hand he scooped up a handful of chicken and a grilled tortilla. He wiped his hands on his apron when he was done. This vendor hadn't been burdened by invisible things called "germs" so why should I ? I ate my taco with gusto.     When The Angels Are Deaf, People Shout The Loudest   After so much walking I needed a place to sit down. Right next to the taco stand was a church and it seemed packed for Saturday mass. In America popular religion was dealt a death blow by television but here in Tijuana it still seems to be going strong. I didn't really understand a lot of what was going on and the church was particularly odd. The walls were either falling apart or not entirely finished yet and as a result the acoustics were horrible. The priest was reciting mass but I don't think communion was being offered. In the back of the church a group of old women were weeping. And there was a side alter jam packed with people clamoring to place votive candles on a shrine. It was a strange slightly mysterious place to me. After twenty minutes everyone in the pews crossed themselves, and then got up and left so I did the same.    The Tijuana Dive Bar Experience   After properly sanctifying myself, it was time to hit the bars and I saw several guys who had been in the church do the same. After talking with a taxi driver, I found myself in this little hole in the wall that made most so called American dive bars look like hi-brow drinking establishments. I walked in and was seated at a dingy little table with four chairs. The table got the mandatory wipe down with a rag that looked like it had seen better days four or five years ago and I ordered a Tecate. There were only five or six people in the place. I settled down with my beer and waited for something to happen. Vendors came by and I had one of the best churros I'd had in a long time. Almost as good as the ones in Spain. It took an hour before the bar got really packed. By that time my table had three other guys only two of whom actually seemed to know each other. I said hi and bought a round of drinks.  Everyone was really very friendly and we shot the shit for a couple of hours. I got lucky because one of the people at my table spoke English well. We made jokes about the tourists, and I asked them questions about the city. I noticed that almost everyone in the place was a guy. I couldn't help asking what was up. My translator smiled and said that in his case his wife was "working" over at a little bar in the red light district and that he'd be happy to get me a deal if I wanted it. Wow, I thought. These people sure are friendly ... I smiled and told him that I was already too drunk to take him up on his offer.    Is That A Part Of Mexico ?   I asked them about other places to check out and that essentially kick started a night of bar hopping and extreme drinking accompanied by my translator / wingman / would-be-pimp. I remember snippets of conversation that I had here and there throughout the night. I've been interested in travelling to Tabasco state and I asked several people about it. They all looked at me with a perplexed expression and said they hadn't been there and didn't know anyone who had. Well, that's what the people who knew it was a state in Mexico did. The others just smiled and looked at me with an expression that said, "What the fuck are you talking about ?". I also remember buying several rounds of  drinks. But at about 2am I had to leave in order to catch the last trolley back to San Diego. I seriously considered staying until the first trolley of Sunday morning but I was pretty smashed so I did the wise thing and went home. I guess next time I should just get a hotel room in Tijuana. It would actually be cheaper than my stay at the hostel.   In any case, I fell asleep on the trolley and had to walk from the end of the line to the Gas Lamp district. For all effective purposes my road trip was over. The ride home was uneventful and long. If there was any where I'd like to go on a second road trip it would be White Horse in the Yukon Territory ... but we'll see.

      It's been awhile since my last blog entry. I've been thinking a lot over the last two weeks. Most of that thinking has consisted of asking myself, "How the hell did I get to here from there on THAT highway ?". If you want a chronological rundown of facts and events read the fucking newspaper. But in my blog symbol is king so if you want the whole story get ready for a parable and learn how to read between the lines.  The year was 1981 and I was eleven years old. I was spending a week in Tappan visiting my cousin David. His father was very kind to us and that year he took us to see the movie Dragonslayer. The tagline read: "In the Dark Ages, magic was a weapon. Love was a mystery. Adventure was everywhere ... And dragons were real". I've had the opportunity to watch the film many times since and I still love it. Dragonslayer came out in the same year as "Clash of the Titans" but unlike most other films of that era it managed to age gracefully. None of the characters are black and white or easy to pin down:  * The apprentice is clearly a fool and greedy for power. * The wizard seems like an impotent charlatan until the end. * The king is unscrupulous but in a Neville Chamberlain kind of way. * The bitchy love interest was dressed as a man for half the show. * The princess is eaten by baby dragons as a result of a noble deed. * The dragon only ate one virgin per year and was a very caring mom.  So if you've watched the film what conclusions can YOU draw about fathers, their daughters and dragons ?
