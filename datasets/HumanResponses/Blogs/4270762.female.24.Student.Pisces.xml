      What a wierd weekend. I didnt do much friday nite except get things ready for the garage sale.  Two of my friends and i had a garage sale saturday, which i had to be at 7:30AM sat. morning!! So that was an early start, i pritty much stayed there until 1pm then rushed home to get ready for a wedding that started at 3pm.  It was such a beautiful wedding!  And the reception was soo much fun.  The only problem was it started at like 6:30 so by 10:30 i was already totally drunk!! Oops! i should have seen that coming.  I had a lot of fun but was passed out by 1am.  Sunday was a day of recovery.  I just slept in, cleaned the house then slept some more... very relaxing.  I feel pretty good today. 
I just finished registaring for classes ...  im taking physics and statistics... yuck!  I hope i do well tho, i dont want to ruin my gpa.  I will most definately get back into study mode, meaning no more going out, or at least limit myself to just one nite a week. ok gotta go, bye!

      YEAH ITS FRIDAY!!  ok so yesturday i lied... i do have a friend who knows about this site she actually got me set up, so sorry about that sarah!  Anywho... im so glad its friday,  I dont have any plans for tonite except to go grocery shopping, clean and do laundry so that i dont have to do that stuff on saturday but im just happy i dont have to come back to this borring job for two more days!!! 
So last nite i went out with my friend, kelly.  We started off at my sister's house and then went downtown to the bars.  We ran into a bunch of friends and had a good time but only stayed out till 12 then went to my sisters house again.  When we got back, there were a TON of people there.  It was sooo much fun!  I didnt get home until 1:30!  So im a little tired today but thirsty thursday sure was alot of fun!!  Yea, so no going out tonite. 
Saturday i have a wedding to go to.  Earlier this week i was all sad about going since i was supposed to go with my exboyfriend, jayme, but now  i m actually excited about it.  There are going to be soo many people i know there, and we are going to drink and dance and have fun!! Im not driving too,  im riding with my brother and his girl friend so i can drink as much as i want with out a worry!  It will be good to get my mind off how sad i have been.  Any who i have got to shampoo my carpets saturday morning and someone is coming to fix the hole in the wall (someone threw a kegger at my house while i was in Cali a couple weeks ago and when i got home there was a hole in my kitchen wall!) So i will be busy all saturday morning.  It should be a productive yet fun weekend.  Well i better get back to work.  Bye for now.

      Not sure why exactly i have a blog... i dont know anyone who knows about these things or would even read this if they did but oh well! I finally figured out how to sign in to "post" on here... what a pain that was... im a little computer-stupid!  I just couldnt find the site or place to sign in. 
Im supposed to be working.. but my job is SOOO boring!  I cant wait  until classes start again then i will only be here a few hours at a time.  Unfortunately they dont start until October!!  Well i cant think of anything else to say so bye for now!!
