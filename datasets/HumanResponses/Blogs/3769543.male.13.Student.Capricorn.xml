      "Trooper" told me about a really fun looking game called "America's Army". I decided to take a look at it. http://www.americasarmy.com. The game looked really fun, and it was  free , so that really caught my eye. One hell of a big file, though. 736 MB! I had to leave my computer on all night to download it.  It was  so  worth it.  The game is downright awesome, but the folliage is a little, well... "Flat". By that, I mean it's 2-D. Most games are like that, though. Oh well. This game has realistic weapons, because it was done and paid for by the U.S. Army. (I think... Yeah, it was). Hella fun. Download it if you ever have 12 spare hours.  Next subject.  I'm not getting much sleep lately, and I'm not too sure why. I might be sick, but I sure hope not. My performance is in what, 2 days now? Jeez. Anna bought a set of knives, which scares me. She has been plotting my death for a long time, if you haven't known.  Very  scary...  I didn't have all too good of a day today. I got dirt thrown on me by Nick and Rachel. Fucking bastards... I guess I deserved it. Yeah, I did. Oh well. I'm still upset. Anna's brother wont let me fix her computer, so I guess I wont. Good for asking, right? I guess actually  doing  it is really better.  Might post some more before I go to sleep.  [edit] If you comment on my blog, please leave your name. Don't worry, I wont stalk you. I have that problem of my own to deal with.

      Only 3 days till the play! I'm extremely happy, yet just as sad. I'm going to miss seeing everyone that was in my group! It sure went by quickly. The title of it is "Fifty Million Broadway Gold Diggers on Forty Second Street". Long, isn't it?  Anyways!  Everyone that's going to the movies after VBS: Are we going to see Spiderman 2? It would be cool if we saw both. Make sure to bring  lots  of money for DDR. I want to prove to everyone that a fat-ish white-boy "wanna-be Asian" can kick normal Asian people's asses at their own game, kukuku. I wonder how many texts I've sent to Anna so far... She's the only one who talks to me on the phone. Everyone else has spoken to me twice, or even less. If you haven't spoken to me in real-life, you're hella lucky. I hate my voice. I can't have it go up very high. It can be annoying for theater.  Very  annoying. I can't wait until my Mashimaro faceplate for my phone comes. Hopefully, it will be here today! I'm not very happy today, not too sure why. Didn't fall asleep last night until 2. Fell asleep with my phone in my hand. Anna was texting me, but I fell asleep, so I feel bad about that. Woke up at around 2:40 and texted her back saying "Sorry, I'm sleepy" or something like that. It was kinda funny. Then again, most things are funny at 2:40 in the morning on a weekday. I really want one of those light-up batteries for my phone. The ones that have a clear case, and light up when you get a phone call? Have any of you seen them? They're so awesome.  Very  expensive, though. $40.00! I couldn't believe it! I would've bought one, but my mom was being mean and stuff and she said that "I don't need one, because [I'm] getting a better phone in October". I still want my phone to look good while I have it. I don't like the way it is. Very ugly. I can't wait until VBS, because it sounds fun. I just hope they don't try to convert me.

      Hi again. I was talking to "Trooper" last night, when he reminded me of an old song that I was listening to a long time ago, in like, 4th grade. It's called "California, Uber Alles" by "The Dead Kennedys". It's really cool. Punk-rock-ish. Still good, though. I'm supposed to be working on my math homework. Yes, I have homework over the summer. All because I got an F on my Math grade. Middle School grades don't even matter, but "the study habbits, do" quote my parents. I really don't care about my grades,  too  much, but... Oh well. I got the VBS Volunteer Jr. sheet. Waiting for Anna to say if I should go all day, or not. Speaking of which, she has been plotting my death for a while. I'm starting to get a little afraid. "If she brings a rolled-up carpet, run for your life" quote "Trooper". I'm trying to figure out how to put background music on my blog, just because the music that I like, I think sounds good. Heidi is  very  nice to go out of her way and fax me the sheets. Thank you, if you're reading this! It's pretty boring at camp, now. Our show's on the 2nd, if anyone wants to see my "acting prowess" quote well, Me, of course. Kukuku.    All the people going to VBS with me, we're going to see a movie after the first day. Dodgeball is what Anna and I decided on. Either that, or Spiderman 2. The Pleasant Hill "Century 16" theater is good, because it has DDR, despite the long-ish drive. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone at VBS. It sounds fun, but I'm just afraid that on like, the last day, Anna will carry out her death-plan. *Shudder*. Oh well, all I can do now, is write my will. Anyone want anything in paticular?   [Edit] We're not going to see Dodgeball, so we'll see Spiderman 2. I figured out how to get the music on the background up and running. The song is called "California Uber Alles". Good song, good song.

      Welcome to my blog. I have a feeling that this will not go very well. Anna's  already  mad at me for making this. If you're reading this, that means that you stalk me. Just kidding, kukuku. I love that laugh. It freaks out Li so much, and she can't do anything about it till Mini-con. I'll be sure to wear a cup then, kukuku. Anyways! I like this more than Xanga, because it gives you more editing options. Which is good and all. Bad thing: I don't know all that much XML, so I can't really do too much, kukuku. If you don't know, feel free to ask why my name is Rachel, or Kitty-Itachi. It'll be a very long, interesting story. Very funny, though.

      Went to the VBS meeting. Very confusing. Saw Heidi and said "Hi" then walked away. It was pretty funny.

      First, I would like to wish you all a happy 4th of July! I've been kind of busy, lately. So that's why I didn't post yestarday. I really can't wait until VBS, it sounds fun, and I get to see everyone. Then we're going to the movies. I suggest that we see The Terminal, then go hopping and see Anchorman. Heidi, you can just go home, then, because we really want to see it. I want to play someone DDR, but I don't think I'm good enough. Kukuku. Standard is hard for me... Goddamn white-ness... Makes me mad...

      Tonight's my play. I'm more than ready for it. Camp just ended too fast. Our group's too old for the Waterslide trip, which pissed me off a bunch. Oh well. Our show's going to kick ass. If you guys want me to lend you a video of it, I'll be willing to do so. It's hella funny. Going to see "The Terminal" with Anna 2 , Kii, and Heidi. Funs-ville.   [After the show]   Wow! That's all I have to say! Great cast, great performance. You guys all rock my world! Watched Spiderman 2 after it. Man, that's a good movie. A lot better than the first. Doc Oc kicked major ass.  [SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING, DON'T READ BELOW!]                 I wish Doc Oc didn't die. He was awesome. He really wasn't evil, just the tenticle-things wanted to carry out the experiment. That's why you shouldn't trust things with A.I.  Like in "I ROBOT" with Will Smith. That looks good, I want to see it pretty badly. Anyone want to see it with me?
