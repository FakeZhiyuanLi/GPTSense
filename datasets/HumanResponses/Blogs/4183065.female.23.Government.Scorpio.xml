      I am a bad bad crocheter.  I finally got my vogue scarf book and am carrying it around with me today, mentally fondling some of the scarves in it but I have been ignoring the concept of crocheting for a while now--ever since I finished Gwen's Green and Pink blankie two weeks ago.  I spent the weekend knitting a bucket hat.  I do, however, have good plans.  I am awaiting the arrival of some light blue cashmere/silk blend yarn that will make a lovely shawl from this vogue book and then, of course, there is the cover scarf...   I still need to go back through and take some pictures of my past projects and update the blog--apparently, I am also a bad blogger.

      I am still waiting for my copy of Vogue knitting on the go--crochet scarves.  I swear it has been lost in some black hole that sucks up all packages bound for me, keeping them in package purgatory for a few days before releasing them.  I just must make the scarf on the cover:      Perhaps it will be waiting for me on the patio when I return home from work.  Its not like I particularly need a new project right now (especially now that I have started   BIG GREEN SCARF   (see the knitting page)  but I just can't help myself.)

      Perhaps forcing myself to write about my crocheting projects will give me incentive to actually getting around to finishing that darn afghan I've been "working on" for a year and a half instead of starting all kinds of new projects.  maybe...

      Microwave Fudge:  (this is a recipe my mom has had for decades and I have never seen it anywhere else...if this is somehow copyrighted, please contact me...)  1 box confectioner's sugar 1/2 cup cocoa 1/4 cup evaporated milk 1 stick butter (yes, butter, not even "light butter"--real butter--period.) splash o vanilla.  1 foil lined 9x9 pan.  1. dump confectioner's sugar into microwave safe bowl.  add cocoa and swoosh together a bit.  2. add butter. (just drop the stick on top) 3. add evaporated milk.  DO NOT STIR ANYTHING!! 4. put in microwave and let it go until the butter is about melted. 5. take out and stir until all of butter is melted. 6. add vanilla 7. continue stiring until everything is together 8. put in foil lined pan and put in freezer.  when set, cut into pieces and enjoy.  Total time: about four minutes.  Feeds: one hungry pregnant woman.  how easy could that be?  I made some this past weekend and, boy, it sure is tasty.  every once in a while when I am feeling daring, I go half and half on vanilla and peppermint instead of all vanilla--super tasty and holiday festive!

      I totally missed out on the proprosed fudge consumption last night.  I made the mistake of eating one to many godiva truffles and spent the night regretting ever contemplating the idea of food.  I think I will plan something a little more bland for tonight.

      Thank (insert your supreme being/force of choice here) for the invention that is microwave fudge.  I have no idea where my mother got the recipe but I have to remember to call her tonight and thank her.  I must make some tonight before I die of cravings (no, probably not possible, but don't ever say that to a pregnant woman.)  I will post the recipe tomorrow so that everyone can enjoy the miracle of microwave fudge.

      Ta da! here is a picture of the growing orchid cactus--I am so proud of it!     In other news--Hurricane Charley looks like he will bring us some hefty winds and rain, so the plants that are still enjoying the sunny patio will have to come in today so they don't get blown away.  I lost a few this year out there but the croton really enjoyed itself.  I think it will go live in the baby's room for now since its so colorful...

      Oh finally, finally, finally, my orchid cacti cuttings I ordered and planted in May have finally started to grow. I thought it was about time to give up on them, they had been sitting in their little pots out on the patio refusing to do anything for months but look like green sticks in dirt. Now, at least, they are multiple sticks in dirt. I can't wait until they flower--the grower said it could be years...such a long time...  Here is what one of them will look like:    So pretty...yet still so stick-like.

      Oh my--my string of hearts is flowering.  After languishing for years in a state of near death, I took pity on the poor plant and let it sun outside this year, thinking at least it could finally allow itself to die out in the fresh air.  Lo and Behold, I brought it in the other day and there are little flowers all over it.  The cuttings I took from it months ago have even rooted and are starting to grow.

      Finally got around to uploading some pictures but sadly few of them are actually of knitting.... anyway...here they are:     mmm...goldfish. and whats that in the back there? a bucket hat? how cute! to bad the lighting is way way off...       what a cute puppy!  I especially love the "i'm getting a massage and i have my tongue out because it feels so good" picture.  thats my little benny..he has such a hard life. I also have another puppy (Petey) but the pictures I have of him here at work are all gimongous so I have to shrink some down and put them up later...     yes...that is an old tangerine that sits on the shelf above my desk. we (my office mate and i) have named him senior flap flap. why? i don't know...it just seems fitting.. as the sticker clearly states though--he is definately a "super worker"

      mmmm...i LOVE goldfish crackers--i have one of those gimongous cartons of them here at my desk at work and am currently eating them off of nauseatingly pink paper (it was the only thing i could find). I took a picture with my cute bucket hat in the background--i'll put it up tonight when I get home to my camera friendly home computer.  i did some work on my baby sweater last night--i have about 1/3 of the back done. it goes really quickly since its basically a little stockinette square. I didn't get to much done as I spent most of the night angry at my dogs who ate my loveseat slipcover while I was at work. darn dogs. they are locked in the kitchen today but I am skeptical of our thrown together security system which consists mainly of a stitch holder device. I hope I do not go home to more furniture destruction.  in other news--there is a buzz around a few of the MAK girls here hoping to get another knitting group going. check out  urlLink Lauren's  fab blog if you are interested.  I have finally finally finally gotten into double digits in the pregnancy countdown--only 99 more days to go until the big day (november 27)! so exciting!

      Bucket hat is done! and looks pretty darn good, if i do say so myself.  This was my first real project that wasn't a giant square or rectangle--I was so happy with myself, I immediately started on a baby sweater from Melanie Falick's Knitting for Baby book.  So Cute! yellow with a seed stitch heart on the front (made out of the yummy debbie bliss baby cashmerino from Stitch DC).  My guage is way, way off because the yarn is so much thinner but I am following the directions for a much bigger size and it is measuring just the way I want it.  (yay for swatching!)  I totally wimped out last night and fell asleep at (wow) 7:30.  I am feeling the third trimester tiredness starting to catch up with me.  I am going to work more on the cute yellow sweater tonight while olympicsing.  I promise promise I will actually put the pictures of all the recent stuff up soon...I meant to do it last night but I was trapped by pillow...quite sad, actually.  I did put a picture of me and my supercute Chihuahua Benny up in my profile--isn't he adorable? I think he needs a sweater too.  I'll have to alternate that picture with one of me and my supercute Schnoodle Petey...i love my dogs!!

      This weekend was eventful--I ripped Big Green Scarf and remade him into a green bag.  It's a little soft sided but is just the right size to fit into my big work shoulderbag with my purse, so its darn near perfect for me.  I also started my very own bucket hat.  I am using the new lion brand landscapes in pink--I was planning on using some of the cascade 220 I bought at my recent yarn store trip but, as I am an instant gratification kind of girl, wanted to use some yarn that didn't need felting.  The hat itself is coming out fantacular and I plan on finishing it up tonight during the Green Bay game.  Even though I went to Stitch DC just a few days ago, I made another yarn trip this weekend.  I went to the local craft store with the intention of only buying the DPN's I needed for the bucket hat but walked out of there with a ton of yarn--including some tasty feeling acrylic/angora blend for my sitcom chic I plan on starting this week.  mmm....so cute and washable too.  What else...oh--some sock yarn for some lime green and pink socks to wear around the hospital this fall when I have baby Gwen (a girl needs to have cute socks on then, right?).  I am considering using some of the leftover acrylic angora blend to make her a matching cardigan--how cute would that be?  I also (i know, i know, the list keeps growing) got some cute novelty type yarn to make a few more bucket hats--it was on sale and I just couldn't pass it up.  I love hats and scarves...  I am stuck at work now but I will post pictures of the completed bucket hat and new purchases soon.  Along with some of my completed projects....  Thanks to all those who posted comments in the past few days--I feel so loved!

      I hate big green scarf.  I killed it an its remains are being made into a big green bag.  I just wasn't happy with the way the edges were turning out and, even though the cable looked great, I was worried I would be unhappy with the finished scarf so...I am going to make a small bag out of it so I can tote around a different WIP. I think I could possibly finish it today and I will post a new picture...:) yay.  I stopped by Stitch DC yesterday for the first time--it was so cute!  I ended up getting some light yellow baby cashmerino and a few colors of cascade 220 to make a felted hat and bag.  I think I will make a scarf with the cashmerino but i haven't quite committed yet.  I had every intention of getting yarn for a cute cardigan a la sitcom chic style but, with the growing belly, I was sure it wouldn't fit right and I just hate being disappointed--So I will wait until the post-baby era when my significant belly eventually goes away.  In my yarn spree yesterday I also ordered some from Webs summer sale...they just had too many good deals to pass up and I am weak.  I ordered a couple of spools of the cashmere/silk blend yarn that is destined for sweaterhood.  I also got come cute purple chunky although for the life of me, i cant remember what kind that has promise of being turned into one of the coats from a recent edition of one of my new knitting magazines.  I never ever used to read magazines and now I am a total magazine ho; I can't decide if I would rather have a subscription or just be surprised when I go to the bookstore...I have the cards filled out and sitting on my desk.  decisions, decisions.  Not much else going on--just preparing for the upcoming wind and rain that charley's remains will bring to us here in DC.  The plants are coming in from the patio and there is some non-power friendly food to be purchased.  blah--I hate storms.

      I've been in denial about my yarn/knitting/crochet addiction for some time.  Then, on my lunch break today, I just "popped" into the bookstore to see if there were any magazines I had overlooked on the 18 times I had been there before... and happened upon the knitting book stash.  Yes, I walked out of there with four new books.  Its like crack, I just can't stop....they are all so shiny and pretty and new....  I was partially strong though and didn't buy three good books I saw because I knew my local library had them (I know because I have had them checked out now for a few weeks...).  I'm probably going to sit here all day trying to think up reasons to justify my new purchase to myself...  addict addict addict....

      My Brown Sheep yarn finally came--20 shiny skeins of Brown Sheep Handpaint wool in Peacock and Cream Puff.  I am so thrilled.  Now I can finally begin my oh so cute felted bag.  I just can't decide between  urlLink Knitty's French Market Bag  or a cute bag from one of my (far too many) books...  oh, the dillemma.

      I had good intentions of simply organizing my yarn stash but I came across this great big bulky cotton yarn I had bought on clearance a long time ago. I had forgotten all about and after it had reemerged from the darkness of the "green yarn tub," I got sucked into starting another new project--I am calling it  BIG GREEN SCARF --ohhh..scary.     For my first attempt at cables, I think it is turning out well. The picture is less than stellar (I shrunk it too much exporting it from my iphoto), but its about 6 inches long making it far from done but working up quickly on my broomstick size 15 knitting needles. The actual cable-ing is a little difficult because the yarn is so stiff but its getting easier as the project moves along. I am using the 12 stitch "Giant Cable" pattern from my shiny new vogue knitting reference book.  My Brown Sheep Yarn still has not arrived. I am also waiting on the new Vogue on the go crochet scarves book to arrive. The scarf on the cover is just nifty.     Hopefully, a package will be waiting for me upon my return home this evening or I will have to face  BIG GREEN SCARF  again...

        I have a thing for hats--especially hats that resemble other things.  I just came across this hat--Berry Cute by Fiber Trends:  urlLink http://store.nobleknits.com/becuhatbyfit.html   I simply must have it.  Unfortunately I am stuck at work and should really wait until I get home to order it....the unfairness of it all is just striking.   An addendum to my last post (obviously, I am not working at work)--I found another hat that is shaped like a pumpkin--fabulous!   urlLink http://knitting.about.com/library/blpumpkin.htm   I need to start a list of projects I will get around to making...

            I am so impatient.&nbsp; I ordered some new bulky Brown Sheep yarn last week to begin the cutest shoulder bag and it has yet to arrive.&nbsp; I am hoping I will come home today and find a big box on my porch but I am trying hard not to hold my breath.      I also had an idea to make a cute felted case in which to carry my digital camera around with me since my lovely dogs have torn the zipper off of my old case. Maybe it will even coordinate with the cute shoulder bag.&nbsp; Geez, this yarn needs to come quickly because my &quot;cute&quot; shoulder bag is quickly becoming a multifaceted project with lots of extras like interior pockets and coordinating camera cases.      I got so little done last night--football and a headache will do that I guess.&nbsp; I was still hopeful and carried my knitting around with me for a few hours but nonetheless, got only one row done on baby Gwen's pink cotton blanket.&nbsp; It is now here at work with me, taunting me.&nbsp; Maybe a bit of my lunch hour will be devoted to it.

      Well, I sure haven't ever done this before.  I had a website way back in the day--remember when Geocities was the coolest? yeah...way back then.   A blog...a place to air my griefs and hobbies (mainly knitting...)  sounds good :)
