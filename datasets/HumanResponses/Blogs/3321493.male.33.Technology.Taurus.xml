      I recently emailed a man named Wayne Hill in regard to a "Gwinnett county clean indoor air ordinance"... this is what I wrote...  ---Start of email---------- Mr. Hill,              I am writing to you in regard to legislation passed December 16th 2003 and put into effect April 1st 2004. While I understand the need for clean air for non-smokers, I can also appreciate smoker’s rights to be allowed to smoke. You and your constituents turned Gwinnett from BLACK to WHITE with no grey area. I have seen restaurants with two tables almost touching and they claimed one to be smoking and the other to be non-smoking. I find this to be absurd and inconsiderate to non-smokers. However, I have also seen restaurants who have COMPLETELY closed off rooms with a separate ventilation system for a smoking room. ABSOLUTELY ZERO smoke was allowed to permeate into the non-smoking areas. You have punished those who have strived to have businesses that can easily accommodate both non-smokers and smokers. While your personal belief may be that smoking is a terrible habit, it is not up to you to decide whether I should smoke or not, it is also not up to you to decide how a business man should run his business.      That being said….I have the following questions….     1)       Why was there not a tougher law put into effect that would make it more difficult for establishments to have smoking areas? Instead of “NO!” why can we not say “OK, but you will have to implement a certain standard to have a smoking area!”   2)       Why (like areas of Florida) can we not smoke OUTSIDE in an open air patio while we eat and have drinks? Do smokers truly deserve FEWER rights?  3)       How can I and my fellow believers in changing this law proceed to the next level to fight it?     I would appreciate any help you can give me to know how I can fight this extreme version of this law.   -----End of email---------  I sent this email sevral days ago and have gotten ZERO respose. I also realized that the name of the law is "Gwinnett county clean INDOOR air ordinance" INDOOR! Why are we not able to smoke when we are outside a building?   I am tired of these people who can't control their own lives and children and telling me I have to pay for them. Why should I not be able to smoke in appropriate areas? Why do I have to endure these idiots who sue fast food places because THEY made them fat? NO! NO! NO!...YOU made YOU fat. If you dont like being fat, get off your ass and do something about it. Stop blaming others for your misfortues. You do not pay me to be your kids babysitter, watch your own damn kids. Learn how to talk to them about issues instead of making me hide the issues YOU don't feel is right.   Stop crying to our government evry time you fell a little out of place. I try very hard to be a kind and respectful smoker. I don't throw my butts on the ground, I dont smoke close to non smokers, If I am in a group of people I ask before I light up, and if I go out with non-smokers to dinner I am OK with sitting in a non-smoking area I can always excuse myself if I feel the need to smoke. I am OK with a law that makes it difficult for places to have smoking areas, but let us stop the gestapo nazi tactics of "You CANT do this"    "They came first for the Communists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me--and by that time no one was left to speak up."  Chris
