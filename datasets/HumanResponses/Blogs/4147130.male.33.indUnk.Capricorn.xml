      Triumphant night last night.  Very very happy with the result.  And, with the rock kick/snare, as well as with a bunch of syncopated snare fills, gone is any last hope of this album taking on a "new traditional" country feel.  Ready to lay down some good old fashioned rock n roll tracks.  Would appreciate a call from Mighty Tom today, as I would like to discuss a couple of questions I have as I get back into the actual mechanics of recording again (with greater quality-control than in the DG album).

      I'm popping in CDs from all kinds of genres, including many that dig deep into my history.  Today I was listening to a little Enya: "The Celts."  Some good music there--perhaps her best in my opinion, but boy it's tough to separate myself from my reminiscent feelings in the songs.  From an inspiration standpoint, I always thought the stark guitar that comes in on "I Want Tomorrow" is just wild.  From a reminiscent standpoint, boy-anybody remember the soundtrack to "Brown Fumes and Yellow Streaks?"

      Dove into the drums for Green Colored Eyes last night.  It had been a long time since I'd worked with Dr. Rhythm, but things went pretty well.  Arrangements for about half the "patterns" were arrived at, and the basic rhythm exists for pretty much the whole song.  I was pleased to see how the arrangement settled nicely into a (kick & snare) (1) bum (2) space (3) ti (4) bum (5) space (6) ti (7) bum (8) space.  Basically, a really solid, standard rock beat.  Obviously, there's plenty of variation, but I'm hoping the ease with which it saddled down into a rock rhythm is an indication of how decisive my departure on this album will be from my past couple (or really, all my previous) projects.

      And so it begins...the proprietor of Camden Coffee Company (the little place I've played twice with Starship Stacy and the Vector Kings) was in a bind--her act for tonight had canceled, and a group of The Red Hat Society were going to be showing up, expecting music. On a whim, I agreed to come in and play solo. I didn't really think about it until I was almost ready to play, but this was going to be the first time I have ever played solo in public! Very wild, for that reason alone.  I grabbed a group of sheet music for songs that we recently played at the Daniel Guitarra release party, and another group of songs spanning a number of genres (some of which I hadn't practiced or played for well over a year), and just went with it. Interesting thing about performance I've learned in my maturity-not sure it would have necessarily changed things a whole lot when I was in 44, but maybe it would have made performances a little more comfortable: unless you are a "famous" band (e.g. one for which people pay a substantial fee to see), it is totally unreasonable to expect people to suspend conversation and watch, non-stop. I simply could not grasp this as a young rocker, and the chattering, engaged with one another-audience was constantly in my head, giving me black, hopeless thoughts and undoubtedly making my performances suffer.  In recent years (I guess, mainly just this year), I have had a new lease on my performance life. The Camden Garden release was kind of weird all-around. I think my (and Pat's) "maturity" level was fine, in that we weren't putting this unrealistic expectation on ourselves, but I think there were other things going on at that show (like a majority of the album songs not being conducive to two acoustic guitars, perhaps some poor song selection) that made it a little awkward. But now I'm having a lot of fun again--very little pressure in between songs, banter feels natural and fun, and playing songs not by me for the most part has been a nice departure.  It was fun tonight--the ladies chatted & chatted as my song list ranged from Los Bravos' "Black is Black" to Paul McCartney's "So Bad," and they occasionally acknowledged me with a few moments attention, a smile, or whatever. Also-like it or not other musicians--but people like, nay LOVE to hear what they know. The familiar songs were OK, but hands-down the hit of the night was as soon as they all realized the song I was playing was leading up to the chorus of "You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me, Lucille," whereupon (of course) they all joined in. I got to play two newly written original songs which received some nice comments, and I got some nice comments on my vox (which is good to hear when you're totally on display--only vocals &amp; guitar). All in all, a really good time, and an interesting sort of gateway into this new segment of my recording career in which I will be working on the first album to be released under the name "Dan Hylton."  p.s. Don't get me wrong, though (especially if Aaron &amp; Krista are reading) I still love playing live with other musicians!

      Not sure if you'll find this very interesting at all, but here goes my first attempt at contributing to The Oliopolis.  I've had a real challenge, starting to work on my new album.  I gone from wanting to tackle any one of three musicals, to feeling that (off the heels of Daniel Guitarra)  alt-country/new traditional was sort of my new calling, back to realizing I really need to make a rock album again.  But even within that scope, I find myself wondering if I should, on some level, try to be conscious of making sure songs have a good, somewhat-related album "feel," or if I should just start writing and see what happens.  Pursuing the former could, if one is not careful, lead to a formulaic result and that non-adventurous middle age we have all lamented our various favorite artists succumbing to.  But the latter could run into what I would call the "44 trap," which is a lack of focus that can leave an audience feeling disjointed, with each song forcing the listener to adjust their frame of reference and not get into a flow.  Right now, it's looking like trying to find the balance between the two AND a somewhat conscious effort at keeping in mind there is potentially a larger audience for this album than just me and my best friends (possibly a failing of Camden Garden?)  In any event, the first song I wrote, "Green Eyes," is (after a 7-year hiatus on the subject) a song about Sharon; or more, our relationship.  Good feelings about what it is and what is in the future.  Will consider posting lyrics and, eventually, some music...

      I'm going to be going out on a limb a bit on this one--a little Devil's Advocacy, but I am hoping this forum can be one of insightful dialogue, not just one-sided rants. And I'm going to shock and amaze my friends in the far, far left by saying that, given feel-good holistics on one side and science on the other, I'll take science every time.  Maybe not that much of a shock, actually. But what I'm really driving at is a type of hypocrisy from a certain faction on the left (perhaps, the "new age" or "alternative" communities, if I may pigeonhole a bit). We have long loved to mock and ridicule and be indignant at the religious right for their utter disregard for consensus in the the scientific community when it conflicts with their narrow worldview. Well, this same scientific community is working to develop and study the vaccines that keep our kids disease-free, and the lifestyles that keep us fit. I became turned on to this issue in a class this last spring where I discovered that, among academics, the acceptance of positivist scientific research is currently at a low point, and the notion of "statisitcal significance" is being called into question. I do not have the math skills, nor the dedication to follow in the noble path that is true science and research, but I can only imagine how I would feel if my efforts, which incorporate the best (only!) data available to the human race in the pursuit of objective pursuit of knowledge were dismissed. Dismissed! On the basis of what? Less data? Less objective goals? Because those are the only two other possibilities!!!  I now look back on my brief stint in dynamic stretching, where the proponents claimed, "Everything you're ever learned about stretching is wrong" with some amount of embarassment. (Scientific) fact is: stretch and you prevent injury, surely as run and you get better at running, or eat too much and get fat. Media in our society is definitely capable of prematurely going public with early stages of research, and there are certainly instances in which funding sources for areas of research must be brought into question. But the conclusions and research I am talking about involve 90+% of the scientific community, through generations of testing and retesting. As Mixdorf suggested in his last post, we are standing on the shoulders of past scientific greats, reaping benefits non-stop in our daily lives. Who are we to and on the basis of what may be now pick and choose what of their conclusions suits our fancy? Are we still evolving? Absolutely. Is it black and white which areas of research have arrived at that "scientific community" stage? Harder to say. There will undoubtedly be some point in my life (perhaps many times) when I will make a decision on science that will someday be disproven. But I don't have all the facts, and sometimes I have to base my decisions by putting my trust in other members of society who have done the dirty work so I can lead my own life. I look at what I now understand about the statistical notion of "significance" and I like those odds. Will I listen to advice from a minister, a guru, or a scientist? In the end, I choose science.

      One of Bush's favorite statements to those who say school reform is impossible, and that the No Child Left Behind Act is a piece of crap.  Well, of all the people to have benefitted from Low Expectations, Bush should pray to his freaky god every night that life works like it does. No one in the history of mankind has worked less hard to get to such a height of power, at least in a system that doesn't pass power automatically by bloodline.  And to pile more irony onto the Everest that already exists, just last week Bush came out to say that legacy admissions to universities (where people get in because their parents and grandparents did) are wrong and should be abolished. Convenient, now 40 years since his own C averaged limped into Yale on the shoulders of his forebearers, and now that his own children have graduated from the same place. Holy shit, the man's actions know no bounds.  Dan touched nicely on my continual frustration with anti-intellectualism in this country. Nobody likes a smarty pants, but apparently they believe every modern convenience and advancement was created by divine intervention (probably some of them do).  It's convenient that the most popular saying of Thomas Edison is that invention is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. he wasn't giving himself much credit. Sure, things are achieved through hard work and perserverance, and I espouse those traits as well, but where would our society be without those individuals who saw past the popular understanding into a deeper truth? Who looked at the same thing that everyone took for granted and saw something more sublime and more wonderful?  These are the intellectuals. Not the jackasses that look down on the world over their half/caf mocha lattes with soy milk and copies of the New Yorker. Those people are morons, and contribute little to society. They're not big thinkers, they're high-cultural conformists. No better than the asshole that wants nothing better than a McMansion and a gas-guzzling SUV. They may, in fact, be worse, since they're exposed to a larger world, and chose only to exist in a tiny part of it.  The world is a complex and wonderful place, full of subtlety and nuance, more amazing by far than can be summed up in any 3 word slogan or catchphrase. It takes science and poetry to tell us how extraordinary and difficult life can be, a constant searching for more and more, simply because 'it's there'. As a society, you don't get to stop, because if early societies had stopped, would we even exist? It takes the wisest among us to guide us through to some greater future, learning from the past but always curious about what lies around the next corner. Looking before we leap just long enough to glimpse a landing spot off in the distance.  Embrace an intellectual.  Vote Kerry.

      We're in the midst of a cold spell in the Twin Cities. Near-record lows. With any unseasonably cool span of days comes the inevitable comments of local residents, "Global Warming? What Global Warming?" Some, as did a particularly clever sort in the Star Tribune this morning, go so far as to send those four words in to serve as a letter to the editor. Ah, yes folks: what we have in this instance is a perfect microcosm of our culture's aversion to complexity of any sort, and it's almost certainly related to the anti-intellectualism that Mixdorf has spoken of a time or two. To quickly dismiss the letter writer and others like him, science has proven (to governments that believe in science) beyond reasonable doubt that our global temperatures are rising. Crazy short-term weather, (whether cold, rain, hurricane, or otherwise), which has become more and more commonplace, is simply more evidence in the havoc that climate change is wreaking on our planet.  But back to the macrocosm: the American people like their political issues like they like their prime-time TV: simple. It is the whole issue of "nuance" that Democrats have struggled with for the last 30 years. Republicans can state any issue in black and white: "they" hate us, "that" is evil, he will "raise taxes," when in reality, of course nothing is that simple and without complexity (or shouldn't be, G.W.!!!). Good politicians (often Democrats), realize that the world is full of "nuance," and that real problems require thoughtful, forward-thinking solutions. Of course, the public will have none of this, and prefer black and white accusations; battle cries; and insulting, simplistic myths over long-winded explanations . Now the far right has figured out that any explanation over six words can be potrayed to anti-intellectual masses as "waffling." For them, trying to sell a guy that is incapable of speaking more a single coherent sentence, it's too good to be true.

      What's the Deal with Luis Palou? Is it just me, or does anyone else find it incredible that a crazy evangelical snake-oil salesman can attract 250,000-people to his little rant? How is this possible? These guys are doubling the audience that a Beatle-reunion would garner, and I'd never even heard of this guy:  urlLink http://www.startribune.com/stories/614/4917513.html , and suddenly our local newspaper (the Star Tribune) is chock-full of feature stories related to his "crusade," complete with photos of him shaking the governor's hand on the front page. Somehow, this dude's promotion was done quickly and without the notice of intellectuals and scientists and progressives in the Churches and (for all I know) the boardrooms and catillions of this nation.  I'm not the first person to suggest that the progressive, inclusive message of the real Jesus has been twisted into a regressive, exclusive "message" of Christ. But how come it is that the hard-line right-wing is considered an insane evil when it's Muslims (or any non-US culture), and "faith &amp; values" when it involves Christians here in the states? Sorry, but to me radical religious fervor is radical religious fervor, and it's never any good when it gets mixed up with government, law, military, or power. That, politically, an unholy alliance has been formed between Christian fundamentalists (who, apparently, believe it's much more important to vote against what they disapprove of rather than on the side of hope and peace) and our corporate interests (who, in their very mission statements, make a mockery of everything Jesus stood for) freaks me out. What should be a desperate sub-culture has suddenly been given new life and, yes, "fervor" as it lashes out in one last mighty throe in the face of, ultimately, irrefutable science, reason, and tolerance. We have, as a race, overcome Witch Burnings, The Holocaust (most of us, anyway), and the arms race of the 80s. This, too, shall pass, but I hope beyond hope there is not irreparable damage to the people, cultures, and resources of the world by the time it does.
