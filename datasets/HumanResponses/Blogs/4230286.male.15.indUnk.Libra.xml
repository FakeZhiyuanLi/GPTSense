       I am a big fan of Case Closed the show airing on Adult Swim, and that is mainly what this blog will be about...  Thats all for now, but I'll be sure to post news as soon as I get my hands on it...  But for now visit the  urlLink Official Case Closed Website , where you can read the detailed profiles for the main characters such as Conan, and Detective Moore.

         urlLink CBBC Newsround  has given their reoports and views on the terrorist threat at Leavesden studios.           It's been reported that there's been an increase in security at Leavesden studios just outside London following a threatening phone call made on Friday.   The studio has confirmed that a hoax call was received last week, but it hasn't resulted in any increase in the already tight security there.    And there hasn't been a trebling of on site security staff.        A spokesperson for Warner Bros. told CBBC Newsround Online: "As with all responsible companies we take the well being of those within our employment, particularly children, very seriously.   "We have in the past received the odd hoax telephone call, but because of our strict security policies we always report these incidents no matter how seemingly trivial, to the relevant authorities.    In this case as with previous hoax calls, no further action has been taken nor will be required".         Hertfordshire Police also told Newsround that they had not drafted in extra officers or police dogs to patrol the studio.    Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is currently being filmed at the studio, and is due to be released in November 2005

         The mysterious door on  urlLink J.K Rowling Official Site  has once again opened!  I am going to post a guide on how to open the door, and solve the problems behind it (Thanks to  urlLink Wizarding Muggles )      SPOILERS  (do not highlight the text beyond this point if you wish to solve the clues behind the door on your own)             Click on the '?' (looks like a hair scrunchie) that takes you to the room with the door that usally bears the "do not disturb" sign.        Click the door handle which opens the door, which leads into a dark room.       Directly below the door handle, and 3/7  way in from the left start clicking, eventually you should hit a light switch.       Once you hit the light switch you should see a dart board w/ three darts, drag the darts to the numbers 7, 1, and 3 (Gringotts Vauld Number).       If you did the dartboard correctly a vauld should now appear, it requires a combination...  to open it click the following numbers in order 3-0-2-7-2-3 (see the noteboard for and explanation for the code) if you entered the correct numbers the green screen should start flashing...       The vault should open, and it will contain one sheet of paper, click it and read an excerpt from Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince!       Highlight the text below if you wish to skip the walkthrough, and read the excerpt anyway.         He looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of grey in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp.

       Here is a special report straight from CBBC Newsround!      JK Rowling gave fans some tantalising titbits about the future Potter books at her reading at the Edinburgh Children's Book Festival on Sunday.   She said she was well into writing book six. She said she was "just over halfway through it". She added it was her favourite book so far.        "Of course I am the only one who has read it and I think it's rather good."         Two key questions         		 		        		 		 		 			         		     She did not give much away about book six, which will be called Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but she said a lot of questions will be answered in it.   She also revealed there were two key questions about the whole plot that she had never been asked.   The first is Why didn't Voldemort die when he tried to kill Harry? JK said that in the end of book four, Voldemort had said he had taken various steps against dying, but we should be wondering exactly what he did.     Dumbledore knows more!     The second question is Why didn't Dumbledore try to kill Voldemort in that scene at the end of book five?

       This is kind of off topic, but I have to ask...  For those of you who watch Adult Swim do you watch a show called Case Closed?  I really like this show, its about a high school detective who is poisoned by a crime organization, and it reverses the aging process, so he is a kid again.  Anyway for those of you who do watch it what are your thoughts and opinions?

       I play ice hockey in Texas (pretty weird huh?), I had a game today but we were short a lot of men, and we lost 4-2. I almost scored, but there were men in the crease (area in front of the goalie), so it didn't count...  I have another game tomorrow really early in the morning, hope I can get up on time...   Update:   Luckily I got up on time for my 7:10 A.M. hockey game, we won too!  I didn't get any goals though, but I played alright...

       J.K. Rowling announced on her Official Website that she is expecting a third baby, who is due next year.  She states that book six is well on track, and there shouldn't be any baby related interruputions or delays.  However she is unavialable to say for sure when it will be finished.   urlLink

       It's official, the title of book six will be  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince  - according to the author, J.K. Rowling who confirmed the name of book under the news section of her  urlLink Offical Website :   urlLink     Well, the door opened at last and I showed you the title of book six - the genuine title, the title that will appear on the published book, the title I have been using in my head for ages and ages. Unfortunately, however, the door opened on the very same day the 'Pillar of Storgé' hoaxer struck, which left a lot of Harry Potter fans bemused as to whether I was having a joke at their expense by posting another fake title to 'teach hoaxers a lesson', something I certainly wouldn't do, as it would simply frustrate, confuse or annoy the 99.9% of you who aren't hoaxers! I tried to give a clear hint that the title behind the door was the real one by making the 'Toenail' joke as well (see 'Rumours'). But just to clear up matters once and for all…  Information you take directly from this site will be truthful and accurate (I might occasionally joke, but as time goes on, you'll learn to tell when I'm joking). Do not trust anybody else claiming to have found information on this site that you cannot access, however seemingly convincing the images they provide to support their story.  I never post information on the site that I do not want fans to read immediately. In other words, anybody claiming to have 'discovered' a message that wasn't due for release yet is lying. There was never anything meaningful behind the door until the 'Do Not Disturb' sign came off!  The 'Pillar of Storgé' was never my title, and I did not change it at the eleventh hour because I was 'found out' (I nearly fell off my chair giggling when I read this).  I was delighted to see that a hard core of super-bright fans knew that the real title was once, in the long distant past, a possibility for 'Chamber of Secrets', and from that deduced that it was genuine. Certain crucial pieces of information in book six were originally planned for 'Chamber of Secrets', but very early on (first draft of Chamber) I realised that this information's proper home was book six. I have said before now that 'Chamber' holds some very important clues to the ultimate end of the series. Not as many as six, obviously, but there is a link.  Anyway: if you continue to exercise patience, you will find that the Do Not Disturb Door opens again… and again… giving you further hints about book six. But as a little bonus, and compensation for having been messed around by Mr. or Ms. Storgé, I shall tell you one thing without making you shift any bricks at all: the HBP is neither Harry nor Voldemort. And that's all I'm saying on THAT subject until the book's published.
