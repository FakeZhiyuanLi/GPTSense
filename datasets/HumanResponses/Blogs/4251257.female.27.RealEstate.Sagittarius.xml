      Been working like mad crazy lately. Argh I need to take a serious vacation sometime. I actually want to go to London maybe in the fall for a week. We'll see with my job if I can get some time off.  I haven't been playing my X box game lately since not very inspired by that or much lately. How is it that it is so difficult to actually meet cool, chill people, who are sophisticated and intelligent as well?? I don't get it since it seems there are very few like that in Boston. hahah Or people who are all of that who have done some traveling outside of the US or lived there.  Boston is so bland and dull quite uninspiring right now. I've been a huge film buff and for independent small films, internat'l films. Yes, I'm still very artsy and love going to the MFA and only a month or so ago I went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum. It's weird I'm a person at heart who loves to learn new things, still loves to rave and go dancing like that, loves designer things, shopping, photography and writing poetry. I can't undesrtand why it is so hard to find descent ppl... Or even a descent guy my family will actually approve of  since they have high standards as well as myself.   Hey a friend of mine told me I should move to London someday . I think that would be mad cool and quite nice.  Who knows where things will take you. It's funny I remember Reality Bites so much when it first came out! I saw that movie with my best friend at the time who was a class of 97' at Dartmouth back then. I don't think there will be another film like that which made fun of the whole MTV, gap and trends at that time. That was all so true and how scary. It is like to an extent not much has changed although there are less videos on MTV, and the new teen movies are crap. American Pie was funny that was classic but in terms of filming making that makes you say oh wow or that gets you really thinking or into that part of your soul that says I know that? It's the same with music everything is so manufactured even trance music such crap? I guess with movies we need good directors, scripts that speak true to the heart not just some big budget drama that is the same old ending. To an extent I feel like has society , the media, become so content with settling  meaning only dollars signs? What happened to Art for Arts Sake?   Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I don't appreciate Spiderman or other hollywood movies or shows. I even like cheesy pop songs but I also appreciate something that makes me take notice, something that makes me question, makes me think... Why stay stagnant? Being a Sagitarius I need to learn new things and be challenged. Yes, we sags like freedom but we also need the freedom of expression in whatever creative outlook one can find. That is why I love dancing, ballet, rave dancing since that is why way to express myself.   I think what is wrong with people?? I mean people are so obsessed with like Britney Spears and stuff? What crap she can't sing nor is she a real dancer? Is it so easy for people to buy into that ?? I mean one needs to think for themselves, create change if one wants it. Don't just settle for things. Hey I am sure people may think I am a contradiction since yes I do own a few designer handbags LV, Burberry, and Fendi. I do doesn't make me a contradiction? One can appreciate some things in fashion and have a certain set of standards? Right?

      I came to this site since I found my cousin and his travel experiences on this. I use xanga mostly another blogring site that many of my friends use and other people. I thought this site may be a neat place to publish poetry or put up pictures. I have many pics on my xanga site of Thailand and some of friends but thought I'd check this out too.
