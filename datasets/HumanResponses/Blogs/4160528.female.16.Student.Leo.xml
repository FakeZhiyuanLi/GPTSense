If A Guy Tells You To Sucks It... Turn Around,Smile And Say... Its Dangerous To Put Small Objects In My Mouth.  you confuse me just about everyday. you were put in my heart and i want you to stay. I know you have a girlfriend but whos that girl on your side. I see you with her all the time. you dont talk to me as much and the phone calls keep getting shorter. you told me you liked me and i beleived you but im not sure anymore. you kissed that girl and made me cry and from my point of veiw you trying to lie. you didnt care at all. you didnt care that i loved you and you were the only one but now im not sure of whats goin on. you dont seem you care or even notice im there. i think of you all the time wondering what your doing and who your with. but it doesnt matter to you. all you know is that you love your girlfriend and that girl on your side. i wish i could go into a corner and hide so im leaving now to find someone new cause i cant bare to even be close to you.....     When i looked over I saw your shame cause the night befor was you to blame. you told me you loved me and i was the only one, but it was just a lie I found there was another someone. With my eyes full of tears and no shoulder to cry on all i can do is cover my ears. you keep sayin that you love me and that it wont happen again. I want to beleive you and put it in the past, and make this love for you last. I sit here and cry and thats all i can do, cause right now i really hate you.  So Im not coming back i cant and i wont.  I want to so bad but my heart is saying dont.  I'll always love You, but the pain you gave me will haunt me too      As i lay in my bed things keep coming to my head. the way we used to be  best friend the way you told me that you would be there till the end. but where are you now, you found someone new and miss you is all i can do. so i sit and weep and the notes i will keep for i love you still and always will. i think back to last year and all i want to hear, is your voice and see your eyes cause all i can remeber are the goodbyes. i still cry like im doing right now and i just want to die. its cutting me like a knif and theres no one here for me and lonely i dont want to be. so im gonna try to sleep now and think of the good times if i know how.      I talk to you all the time, someday i hope your mine. You tell me these thing no one has ever told me before. now your gone and i want to hear more. I hope you get back so i can talk to you again. i didnt even notice how long its been . i havent seen you in a while but i talk to you alot. i hope these conversations never stop. im gonna go rest my head now. and hope to dream....dream of things, how i want them to seem     I love you so much it makes me cry. I dreed the thought of saying goodbye. I dont want you to call or talk to me anymore. All i want to see is you walk out that door. I cant beleive its over or that i fell for your trick but now i realize your just a dick. Why cant i leave, i want to so bad. What happened to the love that we always had. So as i sit and cry, all i want  are my eyes to be dry. I want to be able to think without you coming to my mind, cause to you our love was blind, you couldnt tell how much i really loved you. I didnt want this relationship to end but for some reson you thought the rules could bend, cause you now love those other girls you even bought them necklases of perlse, but i dont care cause its over now. Theres still one question that will be in my head forever.......HOW?     you were alomost my best friend              tell me why it had to end you used to call me everyday and make me feel loved in everyway i understand you found someone new i loved you more and you had no clue why dont you call or talk to me at all you made me cry and told me it was a goodbye so i guess it over we arnt freiends anymore i looked over and saw you with the girl that you adore shes the one you love even tho i was the one that said you were sent from above i hope your happy with that girl while i sit and cry on the floor you dont seem to care while she runs her fingures through your hair i just wish you knew how much i love you     i dont care anymore, im gonna stop trying, cause everynight i find myself crying, its too much for me, why dont you just let me be, i never thought it would turn into something so big, now everytime i think of you i realize your pig, you treated me like shit just like everyone said you would, and now your tellin me to do these thing and i wish i understood, you told me that things will get better if i would just talk to you, but i really dont know what i want to do, then will you just do it again, i am just so sick of men     was there ever a time when you wanted to die cause you found out that life was just a lie Everythings gettin  blury theres nothin left here for me if you only knew what ive been going through i try my hardest to do whats right to find myself crying at night so im going to end it now im taking my last bow please try not to miss me cause ill finally be free     i like you so much i cant take it anymore. it hurts me so much knowing i cant have you. i lay awake at night thinkin what would it be like, if maybe one day it could be you and me. but i know it wont happen even tho i wish it would cause you love someone else and its not me. but if i cant have you then i dont want anyone else, cause your the one that gets me awake in the morning, alive through the day, and happy every hour. What would my life be like if you were part of it?  wish there could be somethin even thought i know there cant. your smile your eyes and the way you just look at me, i sit here writtin this poem about you knowing that i wont have the courage to ever read it to you. you told me you used to like me but you dont anymore. it hurts me so bad to know we will only ever be friends     you told me it would change if i would just say Hi, well i did that but you took it as goodbye, so i guess were through cause im dont tryin, Im sick of comin to school everyday cryin Now its over were not friends anymore All i want to see is you walking out that door you used to help me out when i told you what i was going through even when you knew i was mad at you I want you to know that you were almost my best friend you were different from anyone else so i let the rules bend we used to talk everyday and night but i guess its time for me to turn off the light....       Why is it i sit here and pissed at the shit you do, its not like its anything new. why is it that i try my hardest to do whats right and somehow it always ends up being a fight, i just dont get it why things have to be so hard, these are the times i wish i had a body guard, im goin crazy thinking about what i did wrong, and wonder to myself if i kept it goin, would u know how long.  im done dealin with other peoples problems i have some of my own, my world is like a melting ice cream cone. if u think my life is perfect haha u better rethink that, cause everyay i sit here pullin problems out of a hat. What happen to my best firned the one i thought would always lend a hand. it really does take loosing one friend to find out who ur other ones are, the ones that will be there till the end like a star.      why is it that what i wanted had to end i wanted it to be different with you, i wanted the rules to bend we could have had somethin special, somethin no one else had but thats not how it turned out and now i sit here sad theres so much that i wanted to share when im not with you in seems like i have no air I dont understand why you had to hurt me And why is it that you had to set me free But i guess thats the price i had to pay maybe we can try it again someday But i know i dont really want that Cause i know that im not the only one you look at I had a Strange feeling you would do me wrong And i guess that this is my time to be strong cause im not going back to you i cant and i wont Even my friends are saying dont      I dont know what to do anymore all the bones in my body are getting sore you told me u loved me and that u would never hurt me again but i guess this is now and that was then So i guess its over were not frienda anymore cause all i want to see if u walk out that door You keep making me cry everynight i want to lay down and die i thought we had something special and it could never change But all of the sudden u have been acting real strange so im going to sleep and try not to dream of you cause hurt me is all you seem to want to do....     I did you wrong and i know its true, you trusted me and i trusted you, but i have to tell you now and its ok if you dont want me, but last night when you werent around i was sitting on someone elses knee, I'm so confused right now and i dont know what to do, there is so much more i need to tell you, its not as bad as it sounds but knowing you your take it the wrong way, Last night whern i got home i bent down to pray, i prayed you would forgive me and be with me till the end, you were more then the one i loved you were my friend, so please dont go i want to tell you the rest, but saying it in person would be for the best     I hate you so much it makes me cry I didnt think my mistake would cause a goodbye so i guess its over and we are no longer friends you were my favorite mistake no reson to pretend when you told me you loved me i thought it was true but deep down inside i guess i never really knew you    why do you treat me the way you do? it makes me think that i never really knew you, it used to be that you would never talk to me like that, you must have thoght i was liein when i said i liked you but your the only one i look at, if you didnt want to be my friend why couldnt you just have told me, it would have been so much easier if you would have just let me be........     u shouldnt be mad you shouldnt even care cause i was the one that has always been there. i hate to think we wont be friends to much longer. but everytime i fight with you it just makes me stronger     They all told me it was to good to be true, yes i am talking about me and you, i used to talk to you everyday you made me feel special in everyway you were my best friend please tell me why it had to end now we argue everyday and your tellin me you dont want to stay     i started to trust you because you said i could but you broke my heart like everyone said you would why is it that i cant get you off my mind how could i have sat here and beem so damn blind I shouldnt have gone back to you and everyone knows why now everytime i see you, you walk right on by you act like you dont know me and theres nothing left to say but your the one i think about when i wake up each day

Adjust the tint on your tv so that all the people are green, and insist to others that you "like it that way".  Drum on every available surface.  Sing the Batman theme incessantly.  Staple papers in the middle of the page.  Hide dairy products in inaccessible places.  Specify that your drive-through order is "to go".  Publicly investigate just how slowly you can make a "croaking" noise.  Honk and wave to strangers.  Dress only in clothes colored Hunter's Orange.  Decline to be seated at a restaurant, and simply eat their complimentary mints by the cash register.  Begin all your sentences with "ooh la la!"  Pay for your dinner with pennies.  Repeat everything someone says, as a question.  Write "X - BURIED TREASURE" in random spots on all of someone's roadmaps.  Wander around the restaurant, asking other diners for their parsley.  At the laundromat, use one dryer for each of your socks.  Leave your turn signal on for fifty miles.  Lick the filling out of all the Oreos, and place the cookie parts back in the tray.  Routinely handcuff yourself to furniture, informing the curious that you don't want to fall off "in case the big one comes".  Follow a few paces behind someone, spraying everything they touch with a can of Lysol.  While making presentations, occasionally bob your head like a parakeet.  Lie obviously about trivial things such as the time of day.  Make beeping noises when a large person backs up.  Leave your Christmas lights up and lit until September.  Change your name to John Aaaaasmith for the great glory of being first in the phone book. Claim it's a Hawaiian name, and demand that people pronounce each A.  Sit in your front yard pointing a hair dryer at passing cars to see if they slow down.  Chew on pens that you've borrowed.  Invent nonsense computer jargon in conversations, and see if people play along to avoid the appearance of ignorance.  Sing along at the opera.  At a golf tournament, chant "swing-batatatatatata-suhWING-batter!"  Ask the waitress for an extra seat for your "imaginary friend".  Select the same song on the jukebox fifty times.  Do not add any inflection to the end of your sentences, producing awkward silences with the impression that you'll be saying more any moment.  Never make eye contact.  Never break eye contact.  Signal that a conversation is over by clamping your hands over your ears.  Forward e-mails back to the person that sent it to you.

I cry for the time that U were almost mine, I cry 4 the memories I've left behind, I cry for the pain, the lost, the old the new, I cry for the times I thought I had you  At first, I cried beacause I didn't have you...why do I still cry now that I do?  *Everyone has a life lesson to learn..some of us have already learned ours..and others will in time!*  Sugar is sweet but it rots your teeth The ocean is Calming till it sucks you beneath I thought you loved me, but you too hurt me  Friends are like elevator buttons, they can either take you up or bring you down, choose wisely.

Madness chases some, but waits for others...  Wanting him is hard to get. Loving him is hard to regret. Losing him is hard to accept. But with all the hurt I've felt, letting go is the most painful yet.  Even if the voices are not real, they have some good ideas.  True friends, like diamonds, are precious and rare. False friends, like autumn leaves, are found everywhere  FaItH Is bEliEviNg In tHiNgs WheN cOmMon sEnSe TelLs yOu nOT To!!!  iF u sAy i cAnT u wOnT, iF u sAy i qUiT u lOsE, iF u sAy i'Ll tRy u mIgHt jUsT wIn bUt u hAvE tHe pOwEr tO cHoOsE  angels are supposed to be good....so y did one break my heart?

Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?   Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"?   Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?   Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?   Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"?   Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?   Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?   Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?   Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?   When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?

If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?     ~((TrUsT)) **Hardest thing to earn** **Easiest thing to lose**   ~At least two people in the world love you so much they would die for you. At least 15 people in the world love you in someway. The only reason anyone would hate you is because they want two be just like you. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone even if they don't like you. Every night SOMEONE thinks of you before they go to sleep. You mean the world to someone. If not for you someone may not be living. you are special and unique. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you. Always remember the compliments. Forget the rude remarks. If you have a great friend take the time to let them know how much they mean to you.  ~What would you do if every time you fell in love with someone you had to say good-bye?   What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would be 10 moments of sadness?  What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?  What would you do if you loved someone more than anything else and you could never have them?  Some people live and some people die.   ~When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND will be there.  ~Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear.=(  ~Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.  ~East to the sea, west to the lands, death to the girl who touches MUH man!!!!  ~You don't love someone because they're beautiful.

You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.  ~Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.  ~Every hottie with a body, needs a cutie with a bootie!  ~"You know you're in love when you think about someone more times in a day than you think about yourself."  ~Only little boys who call themselves men say I love you, and don't mean it.   ~Whats betta? a lie that draws a smile or the truth that draws a tear?  ~Last night I looked up at the stars And matched each one with a reason why I love you I was doing great, but then I ran out of stars.  ~No guy is worth your tears & when you find one that is, he won't make you cry.  ~A heart is not a play thing~a heart is not a toy~but if you want it broken..just give it to a boy !!  ~Live life to its fullest...you never know wut days guna be your last!  ~Find a guy who will stay awake to watch you sleep.  ~What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry?  ~Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.  ~Hug only those who hug u back, kiss only those who kiss you back and love only those who love you back.  ~To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.  ~2 ThiNGS In LiFe Sh0uLd NeVeR Be BroKen...PrOmiSes, and HeArTs.  ~Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you but trusting them not to.  ~There's only so many people a person can love.. and when you find that one person you've been looking for, just hold on for as long as you can.. because you never know how long it'll be until that other person decides to just leave you.. promising they'll be back, but who knows if they really will.                .•:º  Learn From You’re Past, Move On & Grow Stronger  º:•.    .•:º   [(..People Are Fake But Let Your Trust Last Longer..)]  º:•.        .•:º  Do What You Have To Do But Always Stay True  º:•.     .•:º And Never Let Anyone -----> . . .Get The Best Of You   º:•.

How could you not know that its you that I adore? I love ur big strong arms and the way they hold me tight. I love it how, when u kiss me, I know everythings alright. Even though I love you, theres still some things I hate. I hate it when u talk to her and say "It must be fate." I hate all of the struggles and the hell you put me through, but everytime i think about it, i realize im too good for you*  *i believe in angels, the kind that heaven sends. im surrounded my angels, but i call them my best friends.  *if my girls jumped off a bridge, i wouldnt jump, id be at the bottom to catch them  *we weren't sisters by birth, but we knew from the start fate brought us together to be sisters by heart.  *friends laught at your silliest jokes, put up with your pissiest moods, go along with your craziest ideas, and still always see the best in you.  *you know someone is your friend when u have a big smile on your face, and they still know somethings wrong  *a friend is one who believes in you when u have ceased to belive in yourself.  *a true friend is someone who walks in when everyone walks out

       Have you ever wondered which hurts the most? Saying something and wishing you hadn't or Saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. ou can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.  Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.  * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?  *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore)  *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?  *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*  I need a real man who kno how 2 treat a ladii .. the type who dont act shadii and wen his boyz ask he says .. yea dat my babii  I waS thE 1 He GaVe ThE StReEt LyFe Up Fo,Who MaDe HiM hAnG HiS jErSEe On Da BAck OF tHa dO', ANd saYd" fuCk IT i dONt waNNa bE a PLaYA nO mO"  I  Be ThA GuRl He CaLL hIs BaBy..

I have short brown hair with blonde highlights... yeah i cut all my blonde hair off and colored it. But its really cute. I love it. Anwayz im 5'2 1/2 (shawty). I weigh 107.. I weighed 114 at phsicals which wasn't too long ago.I have bluish green eyes. Im pretty tan specially sense summer came my way... WOo WEe! I loved it!  Anwayz. Im not that active. Im in the MHS band where i play clarnet. I can't actually say i LOVE it. But it gets me thru school lol.. Newayz. IMma Senior High Cheerleader! Its great. I love our squad this year. And its gonna be great. I hope we have a great year! You should come watch all our games cuz its just kewl ya know. Im in the 10th grade. Im going to try to be a Phyciatrist when i get older.. if that gets to borin im gonna go to Beauty School. Cuz i just love that stuff. Im not that all involved in cheerleading yet but who knows it might change my options. I have alot of great friends. I know just about everyone hear cuz its just like that in a little town. I love to hang out with friends, Im working to get my car. Which i wish was a Hummer H2 but ill get that later. I love to go to parties and all that just to have fun. I like to go ridin in this town that u can't blink your eyes and miss. Cuz you kno drivin thru Sonic and then around the Court House is just awsome. Have you ever driven around the courthouse backwards.. well neither have I but i plan to sometime! Haha... I think it would be kewl to stand on top of the Dam.. And dive off of it (if it was safe) Don't worry i don't think im that crazy to yet. I love music Rap, Rock, Pop, a lil country. I love some old songs but thats ok cuz someone has to keep the good times a rollin...Anyways I love talkin online when i don't have anything to do, or actually have time to get online. But School starts August 19th.. 4 Days after my bday!!!! Its all good tho. Newayz... Lata
