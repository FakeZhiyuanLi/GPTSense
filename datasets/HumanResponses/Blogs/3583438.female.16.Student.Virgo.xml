      nung minsang magpunta ko ng national bookstore para maghanap ng kailangan ko para sa kas2, may isang babae na nagtanong dun sa cashier,  babae : (habang inaamoy ang hawak nyang potpourri) "miss wala ba kayong kisses?  cashier : anong kisses?  babae : yung mabango na nilalagay sa mga regalo.  cashier : ay wala ho.  babae : ay wala. (sinoli ang potpourri matapos nyang amoy-amuyin)  kisses...... naalala ko tuloy.  uso yun dati. iba't-ibang kulay. pero favorite ko yung pink. bata pa ko non. pero naaalala ko pa na hinihila ko pa yung mama ko papunta dun sa section ng bookstore kung nasaan yun.  wala naman akong ginagawa don. inaamoy lang. mabango lang at cute kaya ko yun gusto.  meron pa ngang paniniwala na kapag nilagay mo sa bulak na may alcohol yon e dadami daw.  ano? dadami?  hindi ko alam kung sinong loko ang nagpaumpisa non.   bakit? ano ba ang meron sa alcohol at para maging dahilan yun ng pagdami ng kisses na ewan ko kung saan gawa?  pero bata pa nga ako non. ang ginawa ko, sinubukan ko at nag ala-scientist.  naghanap pa ko ng lalagyan. ilang araw ko binabad ang pink na kisses na yon sa maraming alcohol.   pero alang nangyari.  sinubukan ko uli. nangalahati na nga ata nun ang alcohol at bulak sa bahay namin.  pero wala.  ni hindi nadagdagan ng isa.   (oo. binibilang ko ang ganong kaliit na yun!)  kung sino man ang nagpaumpisa ng paniniwalang yun, siguro malabo lang ang mata nya o kaya duling sya.  o baka naloko sya ng kapatid nya at dinadagdagan lang ang kisses pag tulog sya.  hehehehehe.........

      hu! parang horror! actually, hindi naman ito horror. parang nga lang eh! isa itong socially relevant na pagsasalaysay. (socially relevant daw oh! hehe.....)  ganito kasi yun, nakasakay ako ng jeep papunta sa pav. may sumakay na bata na walang t-shirt. madumi sya na parang nagpagulong-gulong sa kalye.naka green na shorts at ang gulo-gulo ang buhok. unang tingin mo pa lang, alam mo na, namamalimos yung bata. at di nga nagtagal, namalimos na nga at ang dahilan, gutom na daw siya at wala siyang pera.  yung aleng katabi ko, di nakatiis. nagsalita. kung hindi daw sana pagala-gala yung bata sa kalye e tutulungan niya ito. kaya nga lang baka daw mamihasa. mamalimos na lang habangbuhay. tinanong niya ang bata kung nasan ang magulang nito pero di sumagot. kawawang bata. nasermunan pa!  naisip ko tuloy, sa pagkain nga kaya gagamitin ng batang ito ang perang napapaglimusan nya? o sa solvent lang? alam ba ng magulang niya ang ginagawa nya? pano kung gutom na talaga yung bata at wala talaga syang pera? wala syang choice kundi mamalimos.  kanina naman, sa overpass, may isang matandang babaeng namamalimos din. ang nakakatuwa nga lang, e ang dami nyang alahas na suot. may hikaw, bracelet at kwintas may singsing pa ata e. gold ang kulay. kung totoo man yun o hinde, may pambili pa rin sya di ba? pano ka naman bibigyan ng limos kung mas marami ka pang burloloy na suot kesa dun sa mga pinagpapalimusan mo? hay...  sa hirap ng buhay ngayon, ang mahal ng pamasahe at pati ang softdrinks na pamatid uhaw e gusto pang lagyan ng buwis, ang pinoy talaga..madiskarte!  pero sana naman, matuto ang mga taong ito na hindi lahat ay nakukuha sa pagpapaawa at pangaapi sa sarili. alam kong madali lang sabihin at mahirap gawin pero at least magkaroon naman sana ng effort lalo na ang mga magulang ng mga batang namamalimos!  sa totoo lang, ngayon ko lang talaga nakikita kung gano ka-totoo ang hirap ng buhay. at ngayong meron nanaman tayong bagong anim na taon para sa isa nanamang administrasyon, sana naman kumilos tayo at huwag lang nating hintayin ang presidente na abutan tayo isa-isa ng kung anong kailangan natin! napapansin lang natin ang mga mali niya pero ang mali natin ay di natin napapansin!  e simpleng traffic sign nga lang di natin masunod e!  hay.....

      it was one cold night. i couldn't sleep. i know i shouldn't be sleeping after all, tomorrow would be christmas. at that moment, im sure families are already preparing noche buenas while im here sulking in the middle of the night. it was a silent night. the only thing i could hear is the distant sound of my grandfather watching tv downstairs. the air smelled like candy. i don't know if it's just me or it really smelled like candy but i could really smell the change of atmosphere as the clock ticks away. 45 minutes and it would be christmas.  maybe you would wonder why we aren't celebrating like everybody does. yes we are catholics but my family just has this tradition of celebrating christmas at the 31st of december along with new year. on christmas mornings, we would go to church and have a special lunch with my relatives. i didn't notice i have been staring into space for five minutes. i felt my throat going dry. i crept downstairs slowly. careful not to wake my mom and my sister up. it was dark outside. my uncle's room showed no signs of him awake. the deep voice of a lady reporter slowly grows louder. my grandfather is still there watching tv. my brother and my lola were nowhere in sight and in their rooms. they are asleep for sure. i walked to our tall, white refigerator and grabbed one of the water bottles. the cold water poured down my throat giving me chills. i looked at the clock opposite our refrigerator. 37 minutes before twelve. i sighed. how could the time be so slow? i put the water bottle on the counter and i quietly climbed upstairs. the digital clock above the tv says 11:35. i opened my celfone and there were 3 messages. each wishing a merry christmas. i smiled. it was from dear friends. i replied to them and sent messages of merry christmas to other friends. i put down the phone and before i knew it, i dozed off. i woke up to the sound of my mother's voice telling me to get up because we are going to hear mass. i groggily stood up and fixed myself. i went to the bathroom and like lightning, the thought of christmas suddenly brought me a sudden energy. i am humming as i walk out of the loo. i could smell the delicious food my lola is preparing at the kitchen. the whole house is so clean. i could really feel christmas. i and my family ate a sumptuous breakfast together after that, i quickly took a bath. the water is so cold so i have to use warm water so i could properly take a bath. after that i brushed my teeth and put my new clothes on.  the church looked like christmas. it was full of decorations. there were lots of people eager to hear the early christmas mass. they were dressed in their best attires and smiles are on their faces. children are running around playing with other kids while their yayas look after them. it was still dark outside but there are already lots of people. we sat down near the altar. sitting there i could see all the beauty of the church. orange and blue fabrics hang around it and then it was accentuated with angels and flowers. on the other hand, the altar has big bouquets of fresh flowers that complements the motif. not long after we arrived, the mass started. the air has this happy, festive mood. it was christmas. the birth of the messiah. after the mass, i softly thanked him for everything and i lightheartedly left.

      It was an awful day at school. Perhaps it was because of the rain that kept on pouring that day or maybe I was just not in a good mood. I rested my head on my desk and closed my eyes. I felt the cold wood on my skin. I breathed heavily. I could hear my classmate singing from somewhere near. “Nice.” I thought. He was such a good singer. I opened my eyes and watched the raindrops fall gracefully to the soft, muddy ground. The air smelled damp and wet. It made my tummy ache. I closed my eyes again and sighed.  I didn’t realize I was there, my eyes shut, for ten minutes. My desk already felt warm. I stood up and decided to take a walk around school. My gay friend noticed me and asked me where I’m going. “Just outside.” I answered absentmindedly. I took a strawberry candy, my favorite, out of my pocket and popped it in my mouth. Sweet and sour tastes mixed inside my mouth. Just perfect for my feelings that day.  I saw younger batches busily studying, flipping pages of their books. A few who saw me smiled and waved. I returned the smile halfheartedly. I just couldn’t smile and cheat myself. I continued to walk. I stopped at the school canteen and sat there for a while. From where I sat, I could smell the delicious aroma of the newly cooked beefsteak. Before I left, I bought five strawberry candies and kept them in my pocket.   I walked inside our classroom and sat beside a friend. I gave him a candy and he told me something about a song he’s crazy about. I smiled, but this time for real.
