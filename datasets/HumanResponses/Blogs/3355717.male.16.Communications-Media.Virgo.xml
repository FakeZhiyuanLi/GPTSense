      I was browsing through the FanFilms forum this morn, and checked out the site for the DAVE school as was linked by Chris. I've talked to him about the school before, several times actually, but I'd never seen the site. Very impressive stuff...and while the tuition is a bit more than I was expecting (like 25 grand), it's a very impressive curriculum. (Again, I had no idea.) I'm gonna talk to Chris about it some more, see if he recommends it for a dude like me.  It's an interesting idea, the school...it's arranged so you get a lot of experience in basically every prospective area...but then again, I am basing this off the assumptions the folks who run the site want you to get. Another reason to talk to Hanel, he's been there.  In other news, I fell asleep in drivers ed yesterday. That was a riot. This dude is the LOUDEST SONOFABITCH EVAR, and I dozed off in the front row. Apparently (as this was discussed later at McD's with the rest of the class) I was out for like 15 minutes, and he just stood right in front of me, breathing on me, until he tapped me to wake me up. I had to stand for the rest of the day in the corner, taking notes on a desk that was at my knees. Good times, good times. I wear that fucker like a badge, though. I FELL ASLEEP in his class. You have to hear the guy tlk to understand, just trust me here.  *Sigh*  So much to say, so little audience. Bah.

      I hate bathroom fans. You ever walk into the water closet, all ready to go (sometimes TOO ready, I’ll get to that later.) and reach up to switch on the light? Sure. But once or twice in a long while, you miss. Not in the actual bowel movement, remember, but in the switch-flippng portion of the operation. So instead of turning on A: the real light that actually lights up the room, or B: the other, remarkably pointless light that doesn’t effectively light the bathroom and should be immediatley shot, but C: the fan. The bathroom fan is a crazy instrument. You turn it on inadvertantly, and find yourself jumping a foot in the air. I find it somewhat funny, though, as your reflexes are never as sharp as they are the second you flip the fan switch. A quarter of a second after you hit it, your hands swipes back down faster than you can see, switching it off. It’s almost a primal, instinctive reaction: like a burn. On (AGGGGGHH!) off! Irritating. Pointless, too.  Who ever uses the fan, anyway? Think about it. There are several reasons the fan would (theoretically) make sense. A: It clears out the stinky. B: It replaces steamy air with it’s non-foggy cousin. C: It makes the most irritating sound imaginable. But, think about it. Ift the bathroom smells before you sit down for a nice crap, you just run the other way and find the next closest moist bowl. Doesn’t have to be a toilet, if you’re running away from that bathroom your gag reflux is already a mile ahead of you. You. Aren’t. Going. Anywhere. First place you find to drop trou, you are there. As I said, if it reeks before you get going, you just leave. And if you’ve just taken a shower, and the mirror is all foggy (Which, in my case, is a good thing.) you aren’t gonna stand there freezing your ass off as the only warm air is sucked out of the rapidly freezing facility just to see your now rock-hard nipples. And, the only reason C applies is for a cruel joke. It would make an interesting experiment, though, if you think about it. A rather Right Stuff-esque type thing. Lock someone in a freezing, ineffectively lit bathroom, with the room fan going and the switch wired to outside the locked door. I give them, oh, thirty-seven seconds.  Fuckers.

      I'm sitting in biology, doing anything but. I'm supposed to be writing a chapter on meiosis or something...I'm not. Shelly and April are next to me fussing over a The Darkness website.   They are so awesome. Being a fan of 70's music, seeing a 70's style classic rock genre  kickass band like them is really refreshing in this day and age of shitty rap. 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' is awesome, thankyouverymuch.   In other news, Bloody Mary premiered last night on 2k and this morning on Figrinfilm.com. Weeeeeeeeeeeeheehee. People seemed to like it, but so far my only friend that's commented is Greg. I talked to Chad about it when I first sent it to him, AperatureCage commented a few times. CalQDex just called it Figtastic, which doesn't help me much. Oh, and Durb did too. I haven't checked it since around 1 this morning, and i can't here because fucking Alex got NP2k banned at my school network, and I'm at school now. Phoooooooooooo.  More on this later.   -Fig

      Not really. I'm not familiar with CSS, so I had to do a little research. I should be able to make this work the way I want, though, editing the images that are already here and redoing the links in the code. Yay for Photoshop.  So anyway, time to start blogging. I seem to always miss Nina when I get on, or she always seems to have to go not long after I do get to talking with her. Most curious. Talked to Krista, though...found out some goofy facts (heh) about Didneyland.  I'm totally clueless as to blogging, so pretend like I know what I'm doing here. I haven't held a blog in a long time, so bear with.  I finally got Chad's response on Bloody Mary last night, after all sort of collaboration between myself and...him. (Go back to read this post AFTER the 19th, and it will make more sense.) He apparently 'busted a gut' at one person's cameo, done without her specific approval (...heh heh, you know you who are, love ya babe...) and 'laughed heartily' at a blatant diss on him in the film. I wrote the thing so you didn't have to know all the people to get the jokes (most wouldn't know they were jokes) and that so the people who did know them would enjoy the film all the more. I'm happy with it, and Steve hasn't even seen it yet. Ha, tool.  I just realized that the key to a succesful blog is humor. To those who read that sentence and thought I'd make some joke here so I'd be funny: fuck off.  I'll have some funny stuff on here, though. Usually 'Rant' will be in the title.   Anyway, I've got nothing to say...so....peace, folks.   -Fig

      I have nothing to say and 26 letters to say it with, with a limited amount of brain cells backing it up and very little confidence the nothing I say will make as little sense as I don't hope it won't.   In other words, I needed a post so I can start to work on my template. :)   -Fig

       The Longest Three Seconds : A webseries I've been thinking about for about a year and a half now. This may get picked up by Np2k TV, if I'm happy enough with it. Chad's already greenlighted it, basically my choice at this point. Right now my friend Jon is working on the score, and my other friend Ken (durbnpoisn) is writing a lot of it. I don't know if I CAN write that well, and I don't know if Durb can either. But I don't know he CAN'T, so I'm more confident in him. Hee.   The Other Guy : A film I wrote for my friend Ben, being shot in at least three states, for the second NP2k Film Festival. (You may remember my entry to the first festival, Bloody Mary.) With a cast so far of myself, Nina (see below post), Ben, and Andrew...and with a confirmed e-celebrity cameo and another as yet unconfirmed planned for the short, it should be a treat to watch. The screenplay is the thing I'm most proud of of basically anything I've done since WipeOut. (And moreso than Wipeout, actually.) I think the best way to describe it is: "A story about the fourth wall, and those elite enough to tell it to fuck itself."    Figlet TV : A webseries, this time more in the light of BenTV and less of TL3S (in that it WON'T be picked up by Np2k...I...I think.), which I and my friend Greg (see below below below post) are putting together, cross-country. This should also be interesting, with funky little segments interspiced with live bits between the two of us from different parts of the country, doing movie reviews, DLR-esque Ask The Panel (weeeeeeeeee've got letters!) and guest panelists, interviews and exclusive shit no one cares about! All the makings of a really bad show. Thisisgonnabegreat.

      I've only known of mah girl NINA for five months, and known her for maybe four...though it seems like I've known her my whole life. And I've never even met her in person. (That's gonna change, don't you worry.)   I first knew of NINA when BEN brought her to Np2k. She was the second female import from him, the first being mah other girl JESS.  From the get go I was intimidated by her, and it took an obscure photoshopping to bring us to talking to each other. I handle myself well in situations where I'm meeting someone I respect or talking to e-frinds' parents, generally intimidating situations, and this was no different. I must have done something right, we both ended up making it through the night without having a panic attack in respect to the other person.  Since then NINA has been one of my very closest friends, online or otherwise, and I love her to death. Word to the wise, if anyone hurts my NINA, I'm kicking your pansy ass across the room. *Ahem* Anyway.   My favorite things about Nina:  o Her intelligence o Her wonderful sense of humor o How she handles herself o her b00bz omg id hit it

      Listen, folks. I photoshop a lot. Some would say I'm even good.  And all you fuckers with a 14.990.6544.3 megapixel camera, I have news for you.  THAT'S TOO MANY DECIMALS!  No, that's not it. Albeit true, that was NOT my point. My point was, look. You're not a professional photographer. You're not even good. And goodness is a key part of a professional photographers resume. You DO NOT NEED THE 900 PORTRAITS OF YOUR FACE TO HAVE A 60x80 PIMPLE.  If your picture is at normal resolution and you still have a 60x80 blemish, be alert: you may be Enrique Iglasias, see a doctor immediatley.  The fact is, most digital stills these days are so high in resolution because it looks good under the price tag. If you can think of a concievable reason to have a 3,000x2,000 inage, please tell me. They don't make MONITORS at that resolution, nor do they make continents. I say continents and not paper, because, it'd still cover the continent. Scotland called, it wants it's groundcover back.

      Save for maybe Ben. More on that later.  This post is the first in a series, I think. I always read peoples blogs and, while I read the whole thing, I'm always half-hoping to see my name there. So screw it, guys, I'm doing it for you. GREGORY HARBIN. This post is for you.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  I've known Greg for over a year, I just don't think we've known each other. I first heard of the man through Digital Llama Radio, a show put out by CHRIS HANEL, a year and a half ago. There was some offhand comment by CC in reference to a letter Greg wrote to them. Not long after, I started hearing about the Target girl through things I'd see ADAM BERTOCCI post.   When I first came to NP2k, I thought Eaglet (GREG) was EwingSquadron, and paid little attention. It was like a month into knowing him I realized he wasn't. Since then we've held a fairly cool relationship. I'd diss the fuck out of him. He'd bash the fuck out of me. (So THAT'S where my sex drive went.) And then we'd IM afterwards and congradulate each other on the phrasing of our punches at each other.  Recently, (last night) the approached me with the idea to do a show. Figlet TV, he said.   Oh hell yes.   And, to end the post, my favorite things about Greg:   o His sense of humor. o His inadvertant setting-up of himself. o  -and the way he rolls with the punches. o His musical talent, and how he's always there to bitchily host something on his site.

      Back in Black, folks. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. Today officially ends my one month grounding, and I'm never, ever, ever getting grounded from the internet again. I'm way too addicted. Anyway, what's new in my life?  Nothing.  Poo.

      Run Leia Run. Sent Adam a pm the other day, asking if I should have anything in mind when I'm shooting a film for festival release, he gave me a few pointers. Dude's put films in fests everywhere. Run Leia Run. Run Leia Run.   Anyway...not a lot more to report. Got the screenname I'd need for one of the characters, which is "omgd00dliekwoha."   *Shrug* Got nuthin.

      So I got an actor, an old buddy of mine by the name of Greg Stine. I need locations, but that shouldn't be too tough...luckily enough, I may be able to use a currently abandoned school/office building, so I may be able to light it and do some set design (read: pick where a chair or two goes) for this one.  This could be cool.  Likewise, I have a potential track for the film from my friend Jon who composes music, it's most awesome. This should be cool. Lookin' forward to it.

       hi im heidi2: what's/who's shiri applebee?   TheOtherGuysName: Some girl who was in Roswell that Chad has a crush on.   hi im heidi2: lol - put a picture of her on the computer desk   TheOtherGuysName: Maybe he could have NP2k.com in the taskbar?   hi im heidi2: yeah, or the page could come up just he signs on??  hi im heidi2: either works   TheOtherGuysName: Yeah.   hi im heidi2: and, technically, you do have an "on-screen" kiss   TheOtherGuysName: God, Heidi.  TheOtherGuysName: TheOtherGuysName: You're brilliant.   hi im heidi2: lol  hi im heidi2: he never said which screen it has to be on   TheOtherGuysName: And I could have Shiri and Natalie stuck to his monitor, or bulliten board, or whatever.      Heidi just made me realize that it's entirely possible, if not easy, to have ALL FOUR THINGS! WOOOOOOOOOOO! Film Festival, here we come! I knopw right now, for people excluding Dave, Rory and Heidi, that that conversation doesn't make sense. Come back and read this after you see the film, which comes out in TEN DAYS! WOO-FUCKING-HOO!

           TheOtherGuysName: This coming 2k film festival is gonna have a smaller turnout than the first one did, or so it looks.  TheOtherGuysName: From what I can tell, it'll only have two entries if I can convince Chad to let me break the rules a bit.   Sprezz7: why do you have to break the rules?   TheOtherGuysName: Because the project I told you about with "BILL"*, which I then mended, is cancelled as he 'doesn't feel like it.'  TheOtherGuysName: I am otherwise incapable of doing it, so I had to write something else. Which is really awesome, and I never say my stuff is awesome.  TheOtherGuysName: Naturally it was two days later I realized it didn't have any of the four things.  TheOtherGuysName: And it's too serious, and too short, to absolutely butcher it and throw in goofy stuff like most of the list is.  TheOtherGuysName: So I'm gonna make it and let him see it and decide if he'll let people have the chance to vote on it. I made it in time, which is the majority of the reason for the list anyway...but still, that's a big must-have I kinda forgot about. We'll see. I'm making it either way.    *BILL changed for this blog's context    Snippet of a conversation with Chris. Had a nice chat with him, actually, we don't have long chats on a regular basis so that was cool. Lucky bastard is meeting celebrities in and out over there. Reminds me to get myself a job serving coffee in Hollywood. :) Also:   Dave: film   TheOtherGuysName: Lookin' good.  TheOtherGuysName: Unless you can give me an excuse to slow down, I'm gonna start finding actors and locations.   Dave: lol why would you need to slow down???   TheOtherGuysName: Well, script revisions or whatever.   Dave: meh, I dunno if you made any since I read it...lol  Dave: So How could I revise it?   TheOtherGuysName: I dunno, just if there was any changes that needed to be made.   Dave: lol I didn't think I had that much power over the project, it is yours afterall...   TheOtherGuysName: Well, you're my "Main Preproduction Homeboy," and it's going in the credits like that.   Dave: lol cool.   TheOtherGuysName: Unless you want a different title, of course.   Dave: no no, it's your movie, you title it the way you want, you just lemme know if there is anything more I can help with.      I'm also sending the script to Heidi, I'll see what she thinks. More typing for now. &nbsp; I need to start finding myself an actor, and *thinks* like four variations on the location. Now that I think about it, I may be able to do it all at my school. That could work. *Strokes chin* Anyway, I need an actor. Finding that person will be tough. Fritz comes to mind, but last time I checked, we hated each other...so maybe no...not Steve this time, I don't think he'd work. I'll think about Alex and Neil...Neil maybe, he's a cool guy. I'll talk to him, maybe he'd work. &nbsp; And I need to think about how it's gonna be directed, also. Desaturated color? Maybe it'll start oversaturated and Drugs like, and work down to black and white. That was an idea I originally had for The Longest Three Seconds, which has now fallen through only a little...to be made into a film and not a series, for two reasons. One, it's written like a film. Two, NP2k TV is dying slowly. &nbsp; I'll figure something out.

        FilmBuff90: that's surreal   TheOtherGuysName: Yeah, creeped me out when I wrote it...I had to listen to Kylie Minogue for a while afterwards.    TheOtherGuysName: What do you think?   FilmBuff90: quite good   TheOtherGuysName: you're actually the first person I've showed it to.   FilmBuff90: In fact, I don't know if I'm merely just drumming on a 2x4 too.   TheOtherGuysName: It has that sort of feel, I think. You question stuff.   FilmBuff90: that's what a film should do.  FilmBuff90: Why do you think people come out of Hollywood films stupider or more disappointed than they were before they walked in?   TheOtherGuysName: I don't wanna compare myself to the Wachowskis, but it's almost like the Matrix in that regard.   FilmBuff90: No one really comes out of those theaters happy anymore.  FilmBuff90: Films should be able to challenge people once in a while.  FilmBuff90: challenge them to actually think rather than look dumbfounded while they're watching.   TheOtherGuysName: I agree.    TheOtherGuysName: I'm glad you liked it, though. Positive feedback is a nice thing, as I'm really self-concious about my projects.

      It seems that The Other Guy will never be put to celluloid, or to tape, or to binary code, for that matter. Reasons being flaky folks anonymous. We'll say, for the sake of reference in this post only (since despite my apparent grudge, I actually am past this) this anonymous person's name is...Bill. Bill walked out because Bill&nbsp;made plans for the next two weeks. The movie was about Bill, ergo Bill is&nbsp;a non-expendable character. Bill, and you know who you are...not cool.  &nbsp; We'll be putting that aside. For more information, message me on IM. Whateva. So, this making reason for the&nbsp;FILMFEST BLOG! A SERIES OF ENTRIES DOCUMENTING...making a new film in 15&nbsp;days.&nbsp; &nbsp;   FILMFEST BLOG: FRIDAY, JULY 16th - 15 Days       &nbsp;  I made the excellent decision today to to talk to my man Dave about ideas. For anyone who needs someone to shoot the screenplay shit with, go to him.  DAVE  We went through several ideas for something I could do with the locations and folks I had available, and came to three basic film ideas. Of those three, I know which one I most want to do...the problem is, as soon as any of you see it, you're gonna think it's a sellout.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't bother me, I'm proud of the concept. It was my concept originally, Dave and I came up with some meat for it. I'm gonna flesh it out this evening. More on that as I continue.    &nbsp;  The other main idea I'm interested in requires a film permit, I think. Or sneaking around a dry cleaners with a massive camera hoping cutomers don't notice. That would be a fun film too. Seems like something a guy I know, Bryan, &nbsp;would be into.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  More on this later. This should be an every day thing...I'm gonna end up BSing you about the work I've done. This is the first true post so far! Go me.
