                     I completed my primary education in the year 1994 from Vidya Sagar which now changed it's name to MGM School. The medium was English and English medium schools were very rare at my place that time. it was located in the nearest town to my Village. The town named Mananthavady was the cultural and business centre of Wayanad District.                  Then I  completed my high school studies in the year 1997 from St. Catherines HSS Payyampally which is located very near to my home. During that time my father was the principal of the school and my mother was teaching there. So I had great responsibilities. It turned out that what ever I did in the school became a talk. So I the situation forced me to be an ideal student always. Otherwise my activities would throw mud on the images of my parents.                   Later I joined St. Joseph's College, Devagiri for my Pre Degree Course which was locaed it the neighbouring district to my home. I was a student in the science batch(Mathematics - First group) I stayed in hostel there and completed PDC in the year 1999. Now the Pre Degree System no more exists. I was lucky to be a student of last batch of PDC in the state. Because government changed the system to Higer Secondary Education from 1999.                                In 1999 I attended the state engineering entrance exam and got through it. I have an option to take the engineering seets available in the state. I opted for Computer Science and Engineering in Govt Engineering College, Wayanad. The college is situated in Mananthavady and I joined the college. My batch was the first batch of my college. I opted for the particular seat because the institution was very near to my home. I finished my B.Tech programme in the year 2003. The college was affiliated to the University of Kannur.

      I Live in the beautiful village Payyampaly located near the bank of Kabani, which flows to the east. My village is located in Wayand distric which is a hill range area. It does have beautiful landscapes, snowy forests, a fantastic place. I always love to be in my village eventhough I can't because my work place is located in the Garden city of India "Bangalore".       Payyampally is covered with amazing greenaries. I completed my school from payyampally(St Catherine's HSS). The village is occuppied with Christians, Jains and Hindus. And we have a great tradition of communal Harmony in Payyampally. The silent nature, greenary and the good people always force me to go back to Payyampally and enjoy Payyampally

          When you are fed up with something or you have to do nothing, play your favourite song or musical peace. This peace of music generally may not be favourite for others. But you may not disclose it generally, because you also want others feel that you follow the latest trend.     Spend the time listening to it, if possible close your eyes and don't involve in anything else. I am sure that by the end of it, you will have a new idea in your mind. You will be in a hurry to do it, not even able to finish listening to the music. I believe that everyone will have a few musical collections which will definitely innovate them. Music heals the world. It heals your mind.     I have tried this many time and the result was amazing. Even I was able to solve deadlock situations after spending a few minutes dedicated to my favourite song. It creates extra energy in your mind and body.      You will be feeling tired after watching a new nice or great movie. You will be tired after watching a whole cricket match even when your team wins. These kind of recreations give us rest and comfort for the time being but it drains your energy slowly. But I am sure that a heart touching muiscal peace will make you feel more happier.     Try this. It will definitely solve some of your problems. The great Karnatic musician Balamurali Krishna has done a good job in this field. He is engaged in giving treatment to many-with only one medicine "music".

      The outer phenomena that accompany change in the environment – displayed by the structural changes of the musical sound-space – are, due to his natural distance to the environment, less intimate to the individual and therefore less important than the variations of his own character, than the inner play of his qualities which are displayed in the applied motif-technique – in the melody.   To the listener therefore, the tone, or the series of tones performed is far less important than their underlying, deeper musical meaning.   This experience shows that, while listening to the music outside, man is, in fact, quite discretely dedicated to his inner fulfilment, and that he aims at increasing his very own inner joy.   Here classical music demonstrates that man, in his aspiration for the fulfilment of his individual life, is not so much focussed on outer success as it may appear from the routine of day-to-day life. The material strive, represented in music by the outer structuring of the sound-space, is only the outer, necessary effort through which man wants to secure the fulfilment of his inner realm of desires, which is represented in music by the inner enlivenment of the musical sound-space: by the applied motif-technique, the applied sequence-technique, and the applied harmony-technique.   Because the mechanism of inner mastery over the realm of human happiness had vanished from day-to-day life in the past, man became used to pretend that external fulfilment of desires and a materialistic life style were the most important matters for the individual. Thus, correspondingly, the outer analysis of the composition, the outer instrumental structuring of the tone, and the outer ceremony of musical performance gained ever greater public importance, culminating in high material rewards for the superficial “interpreters.”   Yet everyone of us knows deep within his own thinking and feeling that the realization of one’s very own inner world of desires is most dear to us, and we therefore are far from being amused when we discover that someone wants to restrict us in our holiest, innermost realm of life.   Only because outer material subsistence is a natural prerequisite for the possibility of inner fulfilment of desires, certain materialistic activities are necessary to secure the outer existence.   However, neither the composer nor the true musician have ever devoted themselves to this admittedly necessary outer field of life; not that they considered this outer activity for subsistence insignificant, but they realized that their task was to strengthen the field of the inner formation of life – the world of inner fulfilment of desires – as a natural balance to the outward direction of the material way of life.   Through their music the great musical creators wanted, and still want, to keep alive, in man’s everyday awareness, the knowledge that the true purpose of our individual and social life can only be realized through the complete fulfilment of our innermost, personal aspirations.   In the light of this inspiration any external, materialistic activity is but a trivial necessity for securing our inner fulfilment of desires; because to enjoy inwardly one must also be intact outwardly.

      Hardly a word is used with so many meanings on so many different levels as the word “space.” People’s fantasy has given this word manifold meaning from a simple “room” to the universe, and the musical sound-space, too, is just one of the many “spaces” in man’s imagination.  The awareness of space arises from the relative awareness of differences – from duality to diversity, or separateness – the distance between two or more things. On the level of sensory experience the feeling of space requires an affirmation of separateness through sensory perception. In this process a dynamic change of the spatial world must take place in time; indeed, our relative awareness of space actually originates and grows only with a change of the mental space of our imagination.   Under the outer hull of the sound-space the musical parameters move as if in different layers.   The material of the musical sound-space can be compared to our material body, while the motif-space can be compared to our subtle body. The motif-space enlivens the musical sound-space from within, it structures it and holds it together.   In this terms, the sequence may be understood as our mind which, from within, from a state of even greater subtlety, enlivens, structures, and integrates our subtle body, which corresponds to the motif-spaces.   The infinite harmony-space may be compared to that basis of our mind which, from within, from the state of greatest subtlety, enlivens, structures and integrates the mind, which in turn corresponds to the sequence-spaces.

      He was born in a picturesque village that no one ever gave thought to leaving, and he's now known in every corner of the globe. Yanni is, without a doubt, a musical phenomenon, one of those rare artists whose music defies borders and boundaries - whose music speaks to people of all races, all nations. And there is more than ample evidence to support such statements.   How many artists have become the favored composer of every Olympic broadcast for the past decade? Sold-out Radio City Music Hall for ten dates? Played in the shadow of the Taj Mahal, the Forbidden City and the Parthenon? Toured China and more than twenty other nations? Had a TV special seen in 65 countries by half a billion people, was one of the top fundraising artists for PBS, and released what became the #2 best-selling music video of all time? Mounted the #1-ranked concert tour for 1998, and #2 for the entire year even though he did not tour for the second half?   Yanni has always charted a solitary and distinctive path. A champion swimmer and self-taught pianist with the gift of perfect pitch, he left the comforts of Kalamata, Greece, on the spectacular shores of the deep blue Mediterranean, and then began to fashion his own kind of American success story, later to become an international success story.

      - Extravagant tribute has been paid "to the musician and especially the man" (heard on a radio program) who was Yehudi Menuhin. Some even confused the man with the enterprises that profit from the Menuhin "logo" and prosper in its wake. They almost forgot to speak about Menuhin the violinist, the phenomenon who simultaneously astounded America between the wars, commissioned and created one of the masterpieces of the 20th century - Bartok's Sonata for solo violin - and conversed on an equal footing in the greatest concertos of the German repertoire with one of the masters of the tradition - Wilhelm Furtwängler.   Menuhin is primarily an American phenomenon. He was probably the first child violin prodigy to come from the New World and become famous there. I can think of only one predecessor: Louis Persinger. Born in Rochester, but soon forgotten as a child prodigy even though benefitting from lessons with the Belgian violinist Ysaÿe, Persinger was, between 1914 and 1915, concert master of the Berlin Philharmonic under Arthur Nikisch, before being the first great teacher of... Yehudi Menuhin. As we shall see, the career of Louis Persinger was truly a dress rehearsal for that of Menuhin, as if the United States needed a prototype before producing Menuhin.   His second great teacher, who made him feel like "a midget", was Enesco. Enesco was not American but a wanderer. In Vienna and then in Paris where he was the pupil of the Belgian Martin Marsick, Enesco was Romanian. But in his own country, he was not Romanian but Moldavian. Persinger and Enesco taught Menuhin in the style of the Franco-Belgian school, but as reinvented by exiles. In fact, Menuhin's playing was self-taught, a new style of playing, just as America is the new world.   We can more easily understand, when listening to his pre-war recordings, Menuhin's famous statement that he would like to combine "Kreisler's elegance, Elman's sonority ('the violin that speaks') and Heifetz's technique". The role model for a career in these pre-war years was, of course, Heifetz. Menuhin was born in 1916, and Heifetz arrived in the United States in 1917, where his virtuosity had the effect of an explosion: the young Yehudi's education took place while America was acclaiming Heifetz. His first recordings, the most fascinating violinistically, attest to this influence.  Heifetz, strictly from a technical point of view, is already our contemporary. We must not, however, forget that Heifetz's style, rather pretentious with his violin held very high, is not contemporary. We must wait one more generation before this feeling of a faded charm disappears definitively.   The first violinists to speak a language that is still of our time are Milstein, Oïstrakh, and Menuhin. They dominate the post-war period. Menuhin was no longer the flamboyant prodigy of earlier years. History had given him a sort of new humility, a new responsibility. In addition, having commissioned a "little piece" from Bartók, to help him out, he must, in 1944, introduce a masterpiece and struggle to master its frightening technical difficulties. Listen to the fugue from the Sonata in the 1947 recording, played slowly, obstinately, with tenacity rather than panache. Menuhin is wrestling with his own facility.   But, for Menuhin, the major post-war event was his meeting with Furtwängler. Having spent two summers with the German violinist Adolf Busch Menuhin had already discovered German culture. In rehabilitating the German conductor accused of pro-Nazi sympathy, it is also an entire tradition, German culture in its totality, that this New York Jewish violinist means to defend in the midst of America's triumphant cheers. And because he has learned to seek, to adapt, he can mold himself in accordance with Furtwängler's metaphysical vision of the Brahms Concerto. It is of course in the 1949 recording with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra that one must listen to Menuhin throw himself at the notes while taking every imaginable risk. It is here that the Menuhin we will later come to know shows his colors, the Menuhin whose left hand climbs into the stratosphere while pulling at each note, catching it at the end of a finger and vibrating it to limit the risk of going astray. Menuhin is establishing his own style, a lively sound snatched from the string (as opposed to that of Oistrakh who plays with the weight of the sound).  Menuhin's system is thus established. From that base, anything is possible, especially encounters with the most diverse aesthetic worlds. Furtwängler, but also, later, such different musicians as Wilhelm Kempff, Glenn Gould or even David Oïstrakh: who has not been moved by the performance of the two violinists in Bach's Double Concerto in Bruno Monsaingeon's film "Le Violon du siècle"? To understand Menuhin's ability to adapt, gliding into the slow movement while listening to Oïstrakh, one must compare this recording to that made with his teacher, Enesco. These are two different worlds, and nonetheless the same Menuhin. We will skip over the more exotic encounters with jazz and non-Western music, to Menuhin's encounters with himself.  Menuhin's discography contains a large number of "remakes": the well-known concertos, the Bach Sonatas and Partitas for violin solo, the Bartok... As with Furtwängler, these "remakes" are always recreations and not repetitions. The tempos, fingering, bowing, all change. The general expression (striking in the Bach) and the technique are used to seek serenity and balance, even if the hands seem to be at odds with the demands of the music.   There is thus no definitive interpretation for Menuhin, but the search for repose, for a place where music, far from any pretension, vibrates naturally, where it can breathe more than show off. This opening of musical feeling beyond technique and schools, this fierce desire to gather music at the source, can be found today in a Gidon Kremer or a Gil Shaham. It is in this sense that Menuhin's lesson remains exemplary, today more than ever: born in America when Heifetz was triumphing in the media, Menuhin died in Berlin, closer to Adolf Busch and Wilhelm Furtwängler.

         Last Sunday, I was on the way to Bangalore from my home. The vehicle        Two on each side of the road. The cab driver stopped the vehicle in between those animals .The Kannada speaking man who sat next to me shouted, "nari nari..". Mallus shouted, "puli puli....". Those animals were leopards. The cab stopped for 15 seconds. We were able to view those big cats clearly.  covered Karnataka State border. Time was 8.00 pm. We were almost  30 km away from HD KOTTE, a place inKarnataka. I was sitting on   one of the front seat of the cab. In the head-light I was able to view road. Then in the distance, I saw three or four dogs(I thought)                                                     standing in the middle of the road. Those animals were almost 100  meters infront of the bus. Slowly the animals started dispersing to both sides of the road as we neared them. They were four.    As we made loud noises, those big cats, went further away into the forests and dissappeared in the dark . I have travelled may times across the Karnataka - Kerala border from Wayanad to Ooty, Mysore and Bangalore. But this was the first time, I saw leopards on the way. Elephants, deer, monkey, bison, pea-cock and wild-boar are common across this border. But not LEOPARD!!!

            Do you think that you can't be open minded completely?  Or to what extent should we have an open mind?  Do you believe that personals matters are not to be shared?  Or If you believe that you are an open minded person completely, can you assure that you have told each  thought or act of yours to atleast one person?   I believe that we should be completely open minded. At least try to do that. Its like the feeling we will have after a confession. We will feel  relieved once we are open minded. And no one can ever cheat you after that. Beautiful will be your mind. We can imagine the whole world to be full of beautiful moments    No one will try to suicide in such a world No will fell lonely. Try to have a  beautiful mind

             In my childhood my brother used to listen to western music and I also got interested in it, especially pop songs. Slowly I began to think of being a guitarist. When I was in 7th standard my father arranged a person to come to our home and teach me guitar. His name was Johny and he taught me the basics of Guitar. Later, continued my guitar lessons from Baby Kallingal, who is a professional guitarist.     During the time, I started playing guitar in functions conducted in my school. By the time I reached the age of 18 I went to many masters for guitar lessons. Apart from Mr. Johny and Mr. Baby who taught me basics of guitar lessons, Mr. Chinmayananda, Mr Saju, Mr. Benny and Mr. Thej became my guitar teacher. All of them taught me different styles. I learned the Indian karnatic style, Spanish accoustic guitar style, western style and western classical finger plucking style from these masters.     When I joined my B. Tech degree programme, I stopped learning guitar from my masters and started self learning. I used to play guitar in the choir troop in my dioces and neighbouring dioces during that time.     Now, its a pure hobby for me. I spent atleast half an hour with my guitar daily and really enjoy it. When ever I am alone, or feeling lazy in my home, I will start playing guitar and then my mind will get refreshed.

      Today we had a blood donation in my company campus, arranged by Rotary club. I donated blood for the first time in my life. It was a rich experience for me. Eventhough I don't know to whom my blood is going to be used, I have a feeling now that I have saved some ones life.         Most of the people will have excuses for donating blood, ie, no time, I am afraid, I will become weak. Nothing like that. Today only I came to know that the amount of fluid taken from our body will be restored within one day or two day at the most.  Lets do it. A child who is having an open heart surgery, a mother or an accident victim will be saved with your blood. We cannot buy blood by money. We need open minds to donate blood. Let us be open minded persons. Just spent 20 minutes and save a whole human life.  There is no alternative for that. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

      Future is always ucertain. No one can predict it. Your birth star, astrologist, whoever it is, cannot know what will happen tomorrow. And someday, any one is able to do the same, I will die, beacuse there is no point in living any more. Even God wants us to lead a good life, and we will be judged on our activities; I believe.  When I started my primary education, I wished to be a singer. Then during my upper primary education, I thought I would be an astronut in the future. Then I got deeply interested in space science and attended many such programme. But now its a hobby for me to learn about space. During my pre-degree course, my parents wished I should be a physcian. But my mind said, I should go for B.Tech(Sepcialy Aerospace Engineering). But on the time of admission again my mind changed. I joined B.Tech Programme as Computer Science and Engineering Student. Then I felt that my life will be of programmer coding in c or c++ or some machine language programmer working in an R&amp;D firm.  My mind shifted towards teaching profession, becasue I was inspired by some of my professors, as well as my parents, later joined Mary Matha arts and Science college as a lecturer. I taught the students Java, TCP/IP and Linux networking, which I had never learned in my life. That time my mind turned to Linux and open source movement and there was a dislike for MicroSoft Technologies.  After working there for nine monts I got through the interview in Mind Tree Consulting pvt. ltd an IT company. I joined MindTree as Micorsoft.NET technology professional. Now I am working here, and this company is a partner of MicroSoft. After 2 months I was asked to work for Data Ware housing projects and got training in DataWare Housing tools and Oracle tools.  But just after finishing my training, I got my first assignments, work for Cendant AFE projects a French company. The project needs expertize in Java Script, HTML, XML and XSLT.  See the turning points in my life. Who can predict my life? Its all decided by Almighty God. Not by astrologers and start signs. If the future is disclosed then its like we know when will we die and how. What is the point of insurance companies?(joke).

      Now I am queued up infront of God, for the final judgement. Yes its my turn now. God asked me to close all my eyes. Slowly I began to see the my journey(its my life) in my mind. To my wonder I saw the footprints of a stranger following me, invisible. I asked God, "who is it?".The reply was soft, "its me son". I got angry, because I couldn't see the footprints in situations of crisis. I am alone. Then came the answer, "its not your footprint, its mine son". Then where is my footprints. Came the answer, "I was carrying you in my hand son".    'We are never alone'
