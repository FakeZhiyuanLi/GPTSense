      Wow...I just realized that folks could comment on this..YEA...thanks for your comments.  jessica asked what cornhole was.  I was afraid to do a search to find a website, because about 3 years ago I tried to find one by putting cornhole in a search engine and it was NOT a pretty list at all.  Whew...so for any of you ole Navy guys...get that outta your mind.  Here's an article from the cincinnati enquirer that will fill you in on the fun  http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/07/14/spt_worlds_best-kept.html  West side Cincinnati...White Oak...I'm homesick!!  Lived there all my life til I moved here to MS a couple years ago.  I'll be home soon y'all!!  Get the corn hole ready!!  My nephew just got a set of cornhole for his birthday from his girlfriend.  All done in orange with Bengal stripes and Bengal tiger on it.  woo hoo.

      I haven't been good about keeping up with this!  Sorry about that.  I need to learn to make it a habit.    Not much going on in my corner of the world.  Still trying to work out details of my pending divorce and all the junk thats associated with that.  Yuck.  Almost at an end tho I think.    Have you seen the movie "the notebook"?  I highly recommend it!!  Great movie.  I read the book a long time ago, and with my midlife memory, I didn't remember the ending so it was like I hadn't read it at all.  LOL.  But bring the tissues, it's a tear jerker.  Everyone was walking out wiping their eyes.  I did pretty good til I got to the car and all of a sudden busted out crying.  whew...guess it was some pent up stuff from the last few weeks.    One thing I'm sure of, I'm glad I've got good ole DebsFunPages to cheer me up on the days that are blue.  This too shall pass.  I'm excited to get on with the "rest of my life".  And I've got Daily-Blessings.com too...thats for that spiritual side of me.  I'm multi faceted!!  I have been trying to work on my spiritual side a bit more lately.  I've been doing some meditation for stress relief and interspection.  It's awesome really.  Wish I had more time for it.  Have any of you tried Overeaters Anonymous for weight loss?  I've been thinking of trying it.  Or Dr Phils program.  I know it's in my head.  LOL  I've been working out for a year, and if my eating habits were better I would have lost a ton of weight.  But unfortunately, I've not paid enough attention to that.  I've only lost 5 lbs.  Hey, it's better than gaining.  Usually in times of stress the food is a problem.  I don't know about you, but I eat for every feeling.  Sad,happy, alone, in a group, you name it.    Well, I've run on enough for today.  Hope you have a happy and safe july 4th weekend.  Kaboom!!  Make sure you check out the 4th of July pages and pass em around to your friends (you know I had to plug those now don't ya?)  Love ya

      Wow is it hot here in the South.  Humid, humid, humid.  Thank heaven for air conditioning.    My daughter finally got her video of the wedding/reception last Sept.  The man was in  an accident right after the wedding, and wasn't well enough to work on it.  But it was worth the wait.  It was so much fun to see the parts before the wedding that I missed while waiting at the back of the church to give the bride away.  And I couldn't be everywhere at one time at the reception so it was cool to see everyone having a good time, tho.    Have any of you seen the movie "Meet the Parents?".  It's an older movie, and one of my favorites.  It's on the TV now and everytime I see it I see something else that was funny.  If you are ever in a down mood, of course your first choice should be DebsFunPages, but if that doesn't help then try "Meet the Parents".   HEHE  I used to be a sewer/crafter, in fact even had a business at one point in time.  But I got kind of burned out on it and haven't done much lately.  Well, yesterday I bought some fabric to make a shower curtain.  I hope my patience holds out.  Of course, I'm in the process of waiting to finish up the divorce and move into my new place in Ohio so I have plenty of time.  Especially when my sewing machine is in Ohio and I'm in MS.  LOL.  I've been watching too much Trading Spaces!  They make it all seem so easy.  Thats all from me today, have a great weekend!

      Hi everyone!  Had a great trip to Cincinnati.  Wishing it was my last time for the drive from Mississippi to Ohio, but not much longer and I'll be "home" for good.  I will miss Hattiesburg, most definitely, but looking forward to being around friends and family again.    My daughter and son in law are building a house, and I'm looking forward to watching it progress.  She just finished her student teaching for a kindergarten class, and absolutely loved it!  She will be a great teacher, I just know it.    My niece, an interior decorator, helped me pick out some things for my new home.  Wow, I was so impressed.  She was such a help.  She is so good at it!! Me...I don't have an eye for that kind of thing, so I need all the help I can get.  She's only 25, but works for a company that does remodels and designing for the muckety mucks.  So I had to rein her in on the $$ a couple of times, but all in all we had a good time.    2 cousins from Pittsburgh came to my other niece's graduation party, so it was great to catch up with them.  It rained for the first part of the party, but then cleared up and before long the corn hole game was up and running.  Is that a Cincinnati thing or do the rest of you know about it too?  What a name for a game!!    Hope you are all doing good!  Have a great day!!

      I'm having a crazy week!!  I drove to Cincinnati from Mississippi the beginning of the week, and I've been busy with preparations for my upcoming move.  Today was my stepdad's 81st birthday, tomorrow is my cousin's 30th birthday, and Sat is my niece's graduation party.  Holy cow...I am going to be partied out!!    Finally received the video of my daughter's wedding.  The videographer was in an accident sometime after the wedding and it has taken since Sept to get the tape.  It was fun watching it tho...  Hope all is well in your little corner of the world.

      Hi everyone!!  Wow...I went to the movies today and saw the Day after Tomorrow.  It was definitely worth seeing.  the special effects were awesome.  Sure makes you think about all this global warming stuff.  Kind of a sappy storyline, but hey, you can't have everything!!  Hope you are having a good weekend!

      Well...blogs are cool if you can figure them out.  LOL  It took me awhile to figure out how I could get back here to post.  I could read it...just couldn't post!!  Argh  But I found it and hear I am.  I got a ton of email from folks who were glad to hear from me.  From as far away as Switzerland...whoo hoo.  There were too many to answer you each individually but thanks so much for writing.    I didn't realize I had such a boring life til I tried to think of something to write about.  Well, there is always the weather.  It's been stormy the last few days here in the South.  I'm still here awaiting things to be finalized.  But today, it is bee u ti ful.  The sun is shining, the flowers and green stuff are just beautiful after all the rain we've had.  I might just have to take a drive with my top down.  By top I mean the car.  LOL I have a 95 Mustang convertible that was my 40th birthday present to myself.  I can't bring myself to give it up yet.  So it's my extra.  As long as it runs and doesn't cost me much, I'll hang on to it.  Have a great day today

      Whew...here we are away from the hub bub of the webpage...so I'll tell you a little more about me!!  I've been living in Pine Belt of Southern Mississippi for the last two years with my husband, after relocating from Southern Ohio. Guess I'm just a Southern Gal at heart!! However, at this point in time my marriage is ending and I am moving back to Ohio to be near family and friends. Not that you folks in MS haven't been friendly..I love it here...but it just makes sense. My dream is to become wealthy beyond my wildest dreams and live half the year (the warmest of course!) in Ohio and half (the coldest of course!) in the South. For those of you who were around when I moved here and got married a couple years ago, suffice it to say.. there are dark sides to people you don't know about til you marry them ! And for those of you married folks who are spending more time than you should with online friends and pornography, go in there and talk to your spouse!!!! We knew each other for 3 years in Ohio before marrying, but the next time I even THINK about getting involved, I will be doing a background check. And a credit check, and a whatever check I can find !!! Oh yea, and a battery of psychological tests. And interviews with the ex wife. (Now all you guys are saying I'm a bitter ole woman...NOT...just realistic and making a bit of fun out of a bad situation) I did learn alot in 2 years, it's been quite enlightening. I'll leave it at that !!  I've been blessed with a daughter, Meg, and son-in-law, Christian and two grandpooches. My 14 year old peke a poo, Max is currently my main squeeze. I'm the oldest of 4 kids, and have 1 sister, and 2 brothers. My Mom and stepdad are in Ohio, and my Dad and his wife are in Hilton Head. You can guess who I will most likely be visiting come winter. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins in Pennsylvania, and my grandmother, who has a great sense of humor, too!   I have many interests, first and foremost being, DebsFunPages !! I created the site back in 1999 with the help of my son-in-law, webmaster extradinaire. It grew beyond my technical expertise and the fun folks at eUniverse/Flowgo offered to buy it from me several years ago, and keep me on as the webmaster. So I quit my employer of 21 years and went from bank manager to full time webmaster !! It has been such a fun time. I love it. It's also been an inspirational time and allowed me to grow in my spirituality, as I've seen the way inspiration and humor help folks to get thru the daily obstacles in life.   Some of my favorite things are music, reading, movies, family and friends, playing cards, bike riding, traveling, Skyline Chili, the beach, the mountains, and my own backyard. I have a backyard now, but can't enjoy it til the builders finish my "villa". I may be an empty nester but I'm not quite ready for condo life yet, so the villa will be my new home. And my most favorite thing is humor !!! I think laughter is the best medicine and I try to stay healthy !!  Some of my newer interests are working out at the gym, getting thru menopause by doing the redhot menopause boogie, and learning more about nutrition. I've always been weight challenged, and I am going to beat these fat cells into submission if it's the last thing I do!!!   In my daily emails I used to tell folks what was going on in my life, and I always got such a great response from it, but I tapered off when a few emails suggested they didn't give a darn whose birthday it was, or what movie I saw. Now I've had folks writing and asking whats up with me, since they miss my little daily tidbits. So this might be a good alternative, what do you think? Feel free to email me with any comments or questions at DebsFunPages. I'll update this periodically and let you know where I am and what I'm doing.   Keep Smiling!!!  Deb

      Wow, what a weekend.&nbsp; I got the call on Friday that the moving van was going to be here on Monday morning at 7am.&nbsp; Now, I have had most things packed for quite some time, but there is always more last minute things that it's easy to forget.&nbsp; So I've been going over and over and over in my mind and house for anything I might forget.&nbsp; I'm going to head back to Cincy myself as soon as they are gone, and with only a car, if I forget too much I'm sunk.&nbsp; It's been a pretty emotional day too, and I thought I was past alot of that.&nbsp; But I guess that means I'm human.&nbsp;   I'm not much of a morning person, so I'll probably be having dreams about oversleeping.&nbsp; Does that happen to you?&nbsp;   The surprising thing is that they told me they would be dropping my stuff off in Cincinnati on Wed already.&nbsp; They had given me a 7-10 spread so that was a surprise.&nbsp; But a nice one, because then I can get it all over with boom boom boom.&nbsp; I'm having it delivered to a mini storage til November when my new place will be ready.&nbsp; Woo hoo  Hope you all had a good weekend!&nbsp; Start your week off with a smile by checking out the new funpages !!&nbsp;

      Holy cow...I've had so much mail from subscribers with original submissions that I have spent more time reading than I have writing!!&nbsp;   Also, I took a few days off this past week to have a bit of a vacation with my daughter and her friend, Jenae.&nbsp; They flew into New Orleans last Thursday and I picked them up.&nbsp; We stayed in New Orleans for two nights so we had almost 3 full days.&nbsp; We packed alot in that is for sure.&nbsp; The really cool thing is the great deal on a hotel that Meg was able to get us.&nbsp; She made reservations at the Alexa Hotel, which is a boutiquey type hotel that is connected to the Crown Plaza Astor.&nbsp; It was 60 dollars a night, which is a good price for a hotel in the French Quarter to begin with.&nbsp; When we checked in, they put us in the Crown Plaza.&nbsp; We had a beautifully appointed spacious room and since there were 3 of us that was a help.&nbsp; Of course we didn't spend alot of time there, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've ever been to New Orleans you know that there is alot of walking.&nbsp; And we walked, and we walked, and we walked.&nbsp; We visited a couple places on Bourbon Street which his usually quite entertaining.&nbsp; We had beignets at the Cafe du Monde.&nbsp; Went on the Haunted History Tour.&nbsp; If you ever get the chance to go to NO and take one of the ghost tours...be sure and have Midian from the Haunted History Tours.&nbsp; This is the 3rd time I've gone.&nbsp; (can you tell that I have taken visitors ?).&nbsp; He really knows his stuff and is quite entertaining.&nbsp; This company has also been featured in documentaries.&nbsp; They are the real deal.&nbsp; We went on an airboat ride in the bayou and fed marshmallows to alligators.&nbsp; I even held a year old alligator.&nbsp; I about jumped out of my skin doing it, but they convinced me.&nbsp;   Sunday we went to the outlet mall in Gulfport MS and then laid on the beach for a few hours.&nbsp;then we motored over to the Beau Rivage in Biloxi to their awesome buffet and a wee bit of video poker.&nbsp; I broke even, so that was good.&nbsp; Thursday night in NO, we went to Deanies Seafood, a local favorite, and they have a couple video poker machines.&nbsp; I decided to put 2 bucks in one of them after we ate and the girls went to the rest room.&nbsp; By the time they came out, I was up $44.&nbsp; How about that?&nbsp; It was my lucky weekend.  Meg and Jenae left on Monday and drove my 95 Mustang back to Ohio for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; They made it safe and sound.&nbsp; I sure missed them when they left.&nbsp; But that vacation was just what I needed, let me tell you.&nbsp; Between the divorce and Max, I was really needing some TLC and who better to hang with than my daughter?&nbsp;   Hope I've made up for not posting much lately, and my boring posts...LOL...have a great day!!

      I almost forgot I wanted to mention this....  You all read about my lil guy Max...well when he was starting to have a problem with doing his business in the house, I purchased some "belly bands" to try them out.&nbsp; I really thought that they would work great, so I purchased&nbsp;5 of them.&nbsp; Well, this creative lil critter managed to wiggle out of them, both times I tried to leave him with one on.&nbsp; I wish I had been home to watch him.  Anyway, I wrote to Terri at TJs Pet Accessories here on the web, to ask her if there was any way that she would refund the money for the unused belly bands since Max had to be put down.&nbsp; I heard from her today, and God bless her, she had refunded the entire amount for all the belly bands without me having sent them back first.&nbsp; Of course, I'll send them tomorrow, but in this day and age when you have to fight to get refunds, its nice to know that there are people out there who will go the extra mile for a customer.&nbsp; SO, if you need anything for your pets, please make sure you check out TJs Pet Accessories here on the web.&nbsp; Terri will take care of you...and i can tell you from experience, she goes the extra mile.&nbsp;   Ok...I'm off to bed.&nbsp; Gotta get to the gym in the morning...argh&nbsp; :)

      I have a favor to ask.  I'm looking for some fresh new things to be able to make  pages out of.  This can't be something that is written by someone else,  it has to be your own personal work.  Do you write poetry?  humor pieces?  have  any funny pictures that you took?  I won't promise it will be published but I'd  love for you to send it and see if it works for a page!! You can send it to me at DebsFunpagesMS@hotmail.com.  Thanks a whole bunch! I had alot of submissions from my request yesterday, but unfortunately many of  them were by someone else, or were forwards that are going around the web.   Because of strict copyrights now, I am unable to use them if I don't receive  them from the original author. Thanks to those who offered condolences on my little guy, Max.  I appreciate  it!!

      I had a sad week this week.  I had to put my 15 year old pup, Max down because  of cancer.  It's been a pretty traumatic week...he was certainly my little  shadow.  It's tough at this stage  in my life, ending a marriage and moving back  to OH.  I took it for granted he'd be with me...and he will be...in my heart!! I tend to go shopping when I'm down...and yesterday I was in TJ Maxx (I just  love those stores!)  And there was a little statue of a bulldog with his lower  teeth jutting out, and he had wings.  There was only one, and it was on  clearance.  Any other time I would have looked right over it.  But yesterday he  caught my eye...so I bought the lil cutie. I just think he's here to remind me Max is in a good place now.  This is tough  stuff...my lil shadow is gone.  He's in a better place tho.

      This week has certainly flown by what with the holiday and all.  Hope you enjoyed yours.  I spent my 4th of July with my pooch...he was feeling pretty bad, and at midnite I took him to the emergency vet.  Long story short, he's not doing so well.  He rallied a little bit yesterday morning, but then things took a down turn again.  By that time we had the blood work back and his white blood cell count is 3 times the norm.  He's fighting off an infection of some sort, most likely in his belly.  I took him back this morning to the vet, and the vet had to keep him.  He's in doggy ICU tonight on fluids and antibiotics.  And I am feeling so lonely without him around.  He's 15 years old, and although he's been healthy, the vet told me that there is a very real possibility he can't fight the infection.  Tomorrow will tell us more.  Please say a few prayers for my little Max.  He can be an ornery little thing sometimes, but he's still MY little ornery bugger.    other than that...i've just been hanging out, packing a few more boxes.

      Wow!  It hasn't rained yet today...YET.  It's hot and humid and I see there is some on the way.  I hope that your holiday parties are not rained on today.  I'm taking it easy this weekend.  Hangin' out, doing some reading, mostly the magazines that have piled up over the last couple months.    Have any of you ever played Avalanche?  I don't usually play online games, but I needed some mindless relaxation today and so I started playing it.  I know now why I don't usually play.  Because once I get started I say...one more...one more...one more to try to beat that score, one more.  Argh.  But it was fun. :)  I don't have a real exciting life these days, can ya tell?    I think I'll go soak in the pool for a bit  :)  Have a great weekend!

      I don't know about where you are, but the weather here has been anything but August weather.  It's been wonderful.  I've been running around with my top down.  Convertible top that is....get your mind where it should be!!   Last Thursday I was at the Germantown Kentucky County Fair.  It's the longest running fair in the state of KY.   I was there to see a friend's niece participate in a beauty contest.  I've never been to a beauty contest, so it was a first.  She didn't win, but she really gained alot from the experience in the way of self esteem.  So to any of you in Germantown, Ky ....I was hangin' with y'all the other night!!  My villa now has a basement...and they should start framing this week...I'm starting to get pretty excited!!  Sat night I had a super time at the Taste of Colerain here in Cincinnati.  I'm a big fan of Zydeco music, and there is a group here in Cincy who has been on my list of favorites for a long time.  They were playing there, so I got to enjoy them, Robin Lacy and D'Zydeco.  Good food and good music.  Yea!  Have you seen the newest breast cancer awareness promotion on the 3M website?  They are going to build the world's largest pink ribbon using pink post its.  You can help out..here's a link that tells about it  urlLink http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/research/largest_pink_ribbon.jhtml   My niece left for Navy boot camp today.  Please keep her and all the brave men and women serving us in your prayers.   Look for a new homepage for DebsFunPages in the next few days.  It's being redesigned and streamlined for more efficient use.  :)
