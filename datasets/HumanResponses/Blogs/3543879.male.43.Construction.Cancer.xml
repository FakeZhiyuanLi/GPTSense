      Churning the souls furthest depths of despair,  I cling to the remnants of past love     although knowing it devours my resistance. Nurturing the breath that remains, I close my eyes and imagine you...   hope - might, will and can save me, but...  what will be the cost? Am I a puppet of my own desire or, the dream you call "nightmare" taken with a click?

      Why do I care,  There's no gun against my head. Not a reason left to be,  It has all been done and said. You can shave me down to size,  Cutting off beneath the knees, Drowning out, although I tried,  Always there - my aim to please...

      I almost never sleep more than 6 hours in any given 24. Background noise in a crowded room drives me crazy. My first impressions of people are rarely wrong. I understand things that I shouldn't. "Deja vu" happens to me and happens to be. I'm about as pig-headed as you can get. There is perfection in my imperfection. I drive way too fast when I don't have passengers. I collect things (music,T-shirts,electronics,tools,etc.). When I feel inspired, I can write hundreds of poems in a sitting. When I pick up a book I usually read it non-stop, even if it means staying awake for 3 days straight. Friends are sacred to me, enemies even more! I'm non-violent until you get my Irish up, then you had better watch out! Hopelessly romantic is my biggest default.

To all of you out there who read of my art, I challenge you this...  translate, pull apart. The true understanding, for few will be clear, Now show me your champion, the winner so dear. I promise as honest, no lies will I tell, if you find the secret... you've the key to my hell!

      It’s impossible that you could see me, hear me or touch me!   I am the spirit of your yesterdays,     The dream of your tomorrows       And the void in your today. I have always been around you as a guardian angel,   Am the temptation in your candy store of life…      The tear that falls from the profound laughter in your heart. You can not shake me,   You can not warm me or chill me     And I am eternal in you.  ‘Who am I ‘ you ask     The blood of love that runs in your veins …        God in a nuts shell…           Just another person…       I am your soul!

      There is a dark eyed, dark haired girl who has haunted my dreams from a very young age. She is sensual and mysterious with a beauty defying all time. Goddess- she has been tormenting me by her very presence and sending my soul into a whirlwind when she is not there. So deep is this feeling, it transcends lives to something primordial. She is my Eve, apple in hand! Not my âme soeur, for that I have found in my wife and there are many I have passed already in life (not just one, for existence is not that simple), this dark angel revolves between the very essence of love (from whence comes the expression "in love with love") and the Devil herself (I'm not saying the devil is a woman). I believe in reincarnate souls, that there are various levels thereof and that mine is old beyond counting, yet this woman seems to be the focal point of my past,present and future! I choke at the very thought of her... she is my joy and reason être, yet... there is an emptiness that no glass can fill. I can't complain that my life has been horrid, abused or sad ... it has always been what I have made it to be with ups and downs (waves on the ocean of existence), yet here I drown for this dark force "has flushed" my being into oblivion. You may ask where you fit into all this... "Read Me" as time goes on and understand... there is no cure, no bullet to end.... this  phoenix of my love is eternal! You may move away in a fog, but I will always be here just as the earth turns.....

      Born in 1961 (July 7th) on Long Island, New York. My father was a District Court judge (he died about 5 years ago) and my mother worked in electronics (she is retired and still living in New York). I am a French/American citizen (My mom was born here)and I spent many vacations here in France as a child (otherwise on my fathers boat). I wrote my first poem at 8 years old, started working in construction full time after school at 12 and owned my first company at 18. I moved to Florida (Miami) for a year, where I got a diploma in diesel engine repair. Back to New York where I attended school and got diplomas in automotive mechanics,sewage treatment mechanics and boiler maitenance. I worked on and off as a truck driver,tree cutter,taxi driver,construction foreman,bouncer,specialist in demolition,welder(you name it and I've probably done it at least for briefly) all the while attending night school full time (with an occasional day class)and taking any and every class they would allow me to (12 years of night school)with the exception of math classes (not exactly my favorite subject). I came out of all that with an associates degree in liberal arts and about 3 times as many credits as I needed but it was about learning anyway. English and law being my strong points. About the only thing I've done consistently is work on restoring antique boats (wooden) every winter until age 28. I spent 9 or 10 months living in Ireland where I rebuilt a house for my parents. I lived over a year on a 47 foot yacht(1937), 5 and a half years living with Lisa (whom I left for she started snorting coke and there was nothing I could do to stop her),and have had almost as many girlfriends as cars and trucks (87 with what I drive now - truck that is). 1990... I started rebuilding a 1951 Jaguar limo which I put on 6 wheel drive (I'll put a picture on my site one of these days). 1993... down to the finish paint job on the Jaguar, but first a short hop to France to see family that I haven't seen in years because of all my schooling. 3 days after arriving here the family puts me to work rebuilding the Abbaye de Flavigny-sur-Ozerain and my 1 month vacation turns into something else. 6 months later at my cousin Bruno's wedding I meet Paola (from Paris)and after 6 more months of writing on a daily basis we climb the Eiffel Tower together. We get engaged and 2 weeks later she is pregnant(my inlaws will never believe it didn't happen beforehand). I buy my first house and rebuild it in 2 and a half months... and then come the cats...  The next door neighbor had 1 when we bought the house and 66 cats one year later. No laws in France against, no way to keep them out, the place stinks to high hell and he and his 4 brothers are threatening people with guns (while the cops watch amused). Last straw ... they tell my wife they will shoot her if they find her or my children on the street. I punch the cat owner once ,and only once ,in self defense in a confrontation (breaking 3 ribs and splitting his forehead open)...the cops give me a ticket (didn't like my french accent I guess)and I now have a criminal record for the next 7 years (not bad for someone who takes great pride in being a pacifist and honest). We sell in a hurry. I find my dream house (not a chateau but 11 bedrooms is not far)and start rebuilding while running other jobs as an artisan. I meet the Oneals with their chateau and away I go to the life of a monk (try spending weeks on end alone in a 1000 year old chateau every night). Now is when I should get into the emotional part of what's going on in my life...but...that's maybe a whole other story! There you have it! 42 years in a blog shell. To "Read Me" ,it makes me sad to hear your anger and hurt. My mission... as best I can, let people know they are not alone. We all suffer, it's human nature (some more than others). Why...now thats a good subject!

      5 am ... The storm has passed .... it is cooler now ! I've been randomly passing from one blogger to the next. Some of you are very interesting, others seem just to be hanging out dirty laundry. I add little comments every now and then, yet feel as if I pry into private lives. Still no responses to what I have written on my site - maybe I need to say something radical to catch your attention ( example: The little green men from Mars are all doomed to catch social diseases from the experiments they are performing on the cows of Idaho ... Watch out Mister Potato Head, you're in for some stiff competition! ). Somewhere out there is a sheep who might take exception to the remark and Bahh their miscontent!

      Sunrise .... taken as a pill that catches in my throat! Thank God for the coffee I stir in to blend down the vivid color. I don't feel so bright this early for sleep begs me back to darkness. It will be a hot one today in the attic of my dreams.

      Scene 1   Opens on a busy dining room of a restaurant on TeagueRoad in Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland. The center of the room is dominated by two large oval teak dining tables, while the cream—colored stone walls are lined with smaller mahogany tables for couples. In an alcove to the rear are four black vinyl booths lit dimly by false candle fixtures mounted on the wall above each booth. To the left of the alcove is a small window looking out on a darkening courtyard. The central area is well lit by three chandeliers and the glowing embers in a huge green marble fireplace on the left wall. On the right wall is an open doorway leading to the front rooms of the restaurant. Antique pale rose trim wraps the top edge of the walls, and is offset by a plush crimson carpet.The tables are filled with patrons enjoying themselves, both farmers and businessmen alike. Several waitresses hover about the tables, while a very attractive slender woman, named Anne Marie, acts as hostess and seats newcomers while supervising the waitresses. She is of medium height and in her early twenties with an classically angular face., Anne Marie’s complexion is a pale white enhanced by a healthy blush on her cheeks, and is contrasted sharply by her short black hair and startling blue eyes. She is casually dressed in brown corduroy slacks and a white sweater with a brown and green pattern about the collar and cuffs, and is wearing white sneakers. A long thick gold chain is draped about her neck. As she makes small talk with the customers, she is approached from the doorway by a robust young woman who is tall with auburn hair. She is named Marie and is slightly younger than Anne Marie. Dressed in a heavy grey turtleneck and jeans with a clean white chef’s apron she moves with Anne Marie to the right side to speak undisturbed.   Marie: ( with a heavy brogue ) I’ll be needing more peppers, as well as white sausage for tomorrow’s breakfast. What we have on hand won’t be near enough.   Anne Marie: ( with a lighter accent ) All right, I’ll run out now before the market closes. ( Marie turns away to go back to the kitchen ) Oh, and Marie, would you stoke the fire, please. ( Marie does a roundabout heading for the hearth while Anne Marie finishes her conversation with the customers, and glances out a window near the fireplace. Seeing the twilight gathering, she then goes to the dimmer switch by the window and raises the lights in the alcove. This illuminates The Poet who is seated in a booth. He is above average in height and slender to medium in build and looks to be in his late twenties to early thirties. His complexion is sun—burnt, and he has curly short brown hair, brown eyes and a beard. Wearing dress jeans and a dark blue wool dress jacket, beneath which is a beige Hudson Bay blazer, he has dark brown wing tips and is sporting gold rim glasses. The Poet watches Anne Marie intently, apparently captivated by her. As she goes to exit, he leans forward. )   The Poet: ( amiably ) How ya doing? ( Anne Marie nods absentmindedly to The Poet and exits through the doorway as he sits back and sips his coffee reflectively. When Marie passes he leans forward to speak with her. ) The Poet: Excuse me, miss. That woman that just left, I’d like to give hersome poetry, is she married?   Marie: Who, Anne Marie?   The Poet: Damn, I didn’t want to know her name.   Marie: ( does a double take ) What? Uh, no. No, she’s not. ( gives him a cold but bewildered glance, then leaves. The Poet rises with a slight smile, leaving his coffee unfinished, and exits with a distant look on face. )   Scene 2   7 :45 PM. Opens on the Alice in Wonderland exhibit, Central Park, Manhattan. It is dusk in late August, and very humid, with dark clouds moving fast across the horizon. Center to the stage are the bronze statues, the largest of which is Alice sitting Indian-style on a giant mushroom, the Cheshire Cat crouching before her. The White Rabbit stands to the left, holding his pocket-watch up. On the right are the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Doormouse atop a smaller mushroom. A slight wind gently scatters bits of litter across the cement surrounding the statues. Enter The Pointless One stage right. Although he is average in height, his frame is large and muscular. Approximately sixty years old, he is a Negro of the darkest persuasion, with short gray-white hair, brown eyes, and an unshaven gray stubble. Dressed in a ragged blue flannel shirt and brown polyester pants which are heavily soiled and hang tattered down to his bare feet, he is toothless, and is sporting a bottle of Thunderbird. Babbling as he walks, he moves to center stage shuffling his feet, coming to rest directly in front of the Mad Hatter.   The Pointless One: I’m alright now! All I needed was a couple of days to mourn the passing away of my soul! ( throws his head back and laughs idiotically, with great exaggeration slaps his knee ) I’ve reorientated, ( turns to stare White Rabbit statue in the face ) focusing in on the physical-material aspects, and have thrown that useless energy of emotion to the ground. ( spits at rabbit’s feet in gesture, looks up to Alice, then back to rabbit ) You know… that spontaneous rose or poem, when I would rather have died then to be rejected,( sobs loudly with one hand covering his eyes as if to hide his tears ) when fire burned in my heart, and I would look away to hide the passion… ( stares blankly to the right stage for a moment, then turns puppy-eyed to the Cheshire Cat ) or maybe you never noticed? No matter! ( hobbles in a circle then comes back to lean a hip on the Doormouse’s mushroom ) Y’know, today I bought an oil company. Yea-ah! ( overly emphasized ) I was lounging around in my cardboard sidewalk palace, contemplating all the luxurious things I own, ( mumbles sarcastically ) my box, these hard luck shoes, ( holds his foot up so the rabbit can see his bare foot ) my shorts, ( pulls a yellowed edge to his shorts through a rip in his pants ) my shirt. ( pats his chest with both hands repeatedly, like a gorilla ) I decided a fortune still awaited me in the oil industry, so-o-o, I played my trump card( produces a bunch of Monopoly cards and red plastic hotels from his shirt pocket and throws them over his shoulder towards the bushes ) and I won Boardwalk!!! ( with a wave of his hand holds out the Boardwalk card between his two fingers and then slides it in his right back pocket ) After all, isn’t life an extra-large game of Monopoly? ( moves from side to side, staring the rabbit in the face, then turns smiling to Alice ) Gotta dollar?- my cash flow is short, ( holds out hand at waist-level indicating short ) and I need my medicine. ( spins the cap off of the bottle, downing it with a big swig, then throws it empty into the bushes ) Ya know how it is, don’t ya? ( addressed at the walkway as if someone was approaching ) Oh Jesus, I almost forgot! ( to all ) My dog Peuter got a go-directly-to-jail card, and I haf’ta go bail him out. He’s a real pain in the ass, but he gives great stock market tips. ( to the cat ) Gotta run! ( bows like a prince to Alice, then bows to the rest with great flourish ) Now where’d I park that limo, ( turns both ways ) or did I have the jet today? ( sounds of feet on the pathway come from right stage. Hearing this The Pointless One exits quickly left stage. Enter Leslie Blackwater and Ketcham Collean Orelse right stage. Leslie, who is on the tall side for a woman, has a voluptuous hourglass figure. In her early thirties, she has wavy auburn hair cut slightly below the ears, soft features and soft blue eyes with a light and freckled complexion. She is wearing a two-piece gray women’s business suit with a white shirt fringed around the collar and gray pumps with big silver buckles. Ketcham, who is about five foot six, and just over a hundred pounds, is in her early twenties. With a rosy white complexion and long flowing black hair, she has sharp attractive features with piercing dark eyes. She is wearing a black oriental robe/dress that ends just below the knees, which is low-cut but with a closed collar, and black ballet type slippers. Ketcham saunters to center stage while Leslie follows reluctantly.)   Leslie: (with a noticeable Southern accent) Listen, Ketch, don’t you think we should be going? It’s getting dark and it looks like it’s going to pour.   Ketcham: (with a light Irish accent) Come on, Leslie, I haven’t felt a breeze all day, and now that it’s getting nice, you want to leave and spend an hour and a half on a hot smelly train. Relax a minute and rest your feet. (leans her back against the White Rabbit)   Leslie: (pacing anxiously) I know- I’m sorry, but I want to get home and check my answering machine to see if Richard got back from Chicago yet. I miss him!   Ketcham: (disgustedly) I don’t understand why you let your life revolve around him, he’s a slob when it comes down to it… besides, you can do better. (a spotlight illuminates The Poet who has been hidden in the shadows left stage. He is wearing a Pink Puppy RCA t-shirt, torn blue jeans with grease stains, and grimy old work boots which are half-laced. Writing furiously on a brown paper bag, he occasionally glances at the two.) Ketcham: (nods towards The Poet) Take him for instance! He might be interesting. You need some new blood in your life.   Leslie: (repulsed, she whispers harshly) What are you crazy- He’s probably a maniac or something! Look at his eyes- they’re creepy! He’s dressed like a bum, I’ll bet he lives here. Oh shit, he’s coming towards us! (she fidgets nervously as The Poet moves slowly across the clearing with one hand concealed behind his back. Path lights go on in the background.)  Ketcham: (to Leslie in regards to her fidgeting) Cut it out! He’ll think you’re nervous!   The Poet: (timidly stepping up as Ketcham moves to her feet) Excuse me, ladies- I wrote you each a poem. I’d be honored if you’d accept them. ( Ketcham and Leslie turn to each other somewhat baffled as The Poet extends the poetry. Hesitantly, Ketcham accepts first, then Leslie does as well.) The Poet: (encouraged by their acceptance) I’d also like to present you with these, (stepping back, he hands each a red rose, which were what he had hidden in his left hand.) as it is a custom in my profession to give flowers with poetry.   Ketcham: ( regarding him indifferently as Leslie moves behind her fearfully ) Thanks, should we read them now?   The Poet: ( stares Ketcham in the eyes lovingly ) Please wait until I leave, I’m real shy and would surely become embarrassed. ( moves away dejectedly ) Thanks a lot, have a nice night, ladies. ( disappears behind bush )   Leslie: ( stepping forward bravely to face Ketcham ) Was that weird or what? The way he looked, I thought he was going to rob us or something.   Ketcham:  (she unfolds the pager bag and reads the poem once silently, and then aloud) Check it out. It’s called-Deja Vu   Where have you seen me, on TV, just in the air Like a billion other people, on the streets, I’m everywhere In a car, a truck that’s passing, on a bench, inside the park Down a long and lonely alley, by a light post in the dark Was it early in the morning, I came jogging past your house Or on vacation in Europe, I’m the one with the pet mouse Was I cranking on a trumpet, or just banging on a drum Had an accident with you once, you were calling me a scum Where you work I wash the windows, and at home deliver mail I was lying on a sidewalk, close to death, my face was pale I have heard you in confession, and have mugged you for a joy Shot your brother or your neighbor, gave your children Christmas toys I went off on the space shuttle, time to conquer a new world Trying hard to hypnotize you, my gold watch, you watched, it twirled I was captain on a steamer, and the president of France Dropped a bomb on Hiroshima, at the disco saw you dance I had served you chocolate pudding, the dry cleaner with your clothes I am standing here beside you, sold you tickets at the show I was there when you were married, came of age, I helped you vote Gave you money on your birthday, own the mansion with the moat I ‘m a leper, bum, a wino, the old lady with the bags Made that fancy quilted blanket, cried to you when I was sad I was lost in snowy mountains with no chance of me to find I was locked inside a padded room, having cut loose of my mind I’m the guy you thought you once loved, but it proved of no avail I’m the soul left broken-hearted  feeling shocked on the third rail...   ( pauses to catch her breath and leans back on the mushroom )   Deja Vu means having seen something before, in French, doesn’t it? You know, like a premonition.   Leslie: (addressed to where The Poet disappeared ) That guy is strange. Here, read mine. ( hands over paper bag )   Ketcham: ( takes the poem and reads it aloud )   Inept...   The heart that pumps an ice cold bloodwas tempered deep in hell So putrid is its purposeas eyes with tears they swell Unwanted and unwanting unable and unknown The soul, it shrinks in uselessness And mind is wasted ….blown.   (hands the poem back to Leslie)   Leslie: (holding the poem cautiously) They both sound suicidal to me. What’s his problem?   Ketcham: (slightly annoyed) I think they’re sad, you can see it in his eyes. It’s like he’s hiding a lot of pain.   Leslie:(sarcastically) He’s not in pain, he’s insane. We’re lucky he didn’t kill us or something. ( looks at the rose in her hand) He probably put poison on the thorns, or acid on the paper. (throws the rose and the poem to the ground ) Come on, let’s go now! (she grabs Ketcham by the hand as Ketcham glances down at the rose and poem and is led away. The Poet slowly walks back on stage and picks up his spurned gifts, one in each hand.)   The Poet: (soberly) If you only knew the pains of hope, (a tear rolls down his cheek as he raises the rose in his clenched hand before him and squeezes it until blood trickles down his wrist, and then throws it violently away ) if only you knew....   Scene 3   9:00 PM. Opens aboard a Long Island Railroad train.Leslie and Ketcham are in a coach that is in rundown condition, on their way to Leslie’s apartment. Graffiti mars the seats, walls, and advertisements. Leslie and Ketcham are seated in the middle of the car on the right side. To the left rear are eight Hispanic-looking teenage boys and one mullato girl. Three of the boys are standing, goofing around loudly with each other, while the girl is ignoring her companions and drawing a “Kilroy was here” doodle on the window in black marker. Towards the front are two businessmen and an old couple who appear oblivious to the rowdiness behind them.   Ketcham: ( twirls the rose in her hand ) I like his poem, it says a lot— kinda like the ones Walter used to give me. I wish he had signed his name.   Leslie: ( sneers down her nose at Ketcham ) Will you forget about him He’s probably out raping someone as we speak. And he was a whole different kind of crazy.   Ketcham: ( gazes out window briefly ) Give me a break, Les.. Why do you always have to be so negative about everything.( exasperated, she mocks Leslie’s sneer ) I’m sure he’s a really nice guy— just a little mysterious.   Leslie: ( angered by Ketcham’s exaggerated expression ) Nice guy- huh… Well, he can finish last as far as I’m concerned.   Ketcham: ( loudly ) God! You can be such a bitch sometimes! ( just then a strung-out hippie type in fatigues walks towards the rear of car carrying a poster of the ad “This is your brain on drugs”. He approaches the two women and holds up the sign. )   Hippie: ( in a Halcion daze ) Hey, babes, ya wanna make a donation to the war on drugs?   Leslie: ( antagonistically ) No! On which side are you? ( the hippie shrugs and exits through the rear of the car. Leslie stares down the aisle angrily as Ketcham settles back with a frustrated sigh. )   Scene 4   10:00 PM. Opens on the shoulder of the Long Island Expressway. It is not raining now but puddles line the shoulder of the roadway from a previous downpour. Marvelous Marvin is trying to break the lug nuts free on the front left tire of a Mazda pickup truck. At a mere five foot five, he does not have a muscular build for a man in his late twenties. With a dark tan complexion and short straight blond hair, he has peculiarly shamrock green eyes. Dressed in a navy blue three-piece pinstripe suit, he has a lime green shirt, a forest green tie, and black dress shoes with green and blue argyle socks. Richland Logico is sitting in the passenger seat of the truck with his eyes closed and head back, feigning sleep. Also in his late twenties, he is close to six feet in height and chubby. His complexion is light, aside from a bright red nose which is somewhat flattened. His hair, short and brown with a large bald spot, and a reddish beard contrasts his gray-green eyes. We can see he is dressed in a yellow and white polo shirt. As the lug wrench slips, Marv falls off balance onto his posterior with a splash.   Marv: ( grabbing the wrench and leaping to his feet, he raises it above his head. ) You mutha! ( angrily throws the wrench down which rebounds into his shin. He grabs his leg and hops on one foot ) Shit! Shit! Shiiit! ( it starts to drizzle ) Richland: ( rolls down his window and asks coyly ) Are you going to be able to fix it, or shall we find a phone and call a taxi?   Marv: No way I’m gonna leave my truck on the side of the Expressway! ( a car speeds by, horn blaring, and douses Marv with a sheet of water. Enraged, he yells after the car ) Muthafuckah, I’ll kick your goddamn ass! ( turns back wiping face futilely with sleeve ) Son of a bitch! ( shaking his head amused, Richland rolls the window up and leans back again. Marv, hearing the roar of a large vehicle approaching, starts to jump up and down waving his arms. A 1951 Jaguar Mark IX skids to a halt in front of the Mazda. It is two-tone, John Deere green over forest green, and stands over eight feet high on all wheel drive. With dual tires in the rear, the chrome running boards have small white lights that face up illuminating the body of the car. Dim green lights highlight the custom license plate, which reads “UNIQUE I”. The Poet jumps out. )   The Poet: ( nearing Marv ) Need a hand?!   Marv: ( resignedly ) Yeah, I’d appreciate it. I got a flat and can’t break the nuts loose.   The Poet: ( bending over to inspect the tire, he yanks a nail from a tread ) Here’s your problem, you picked up a nail. ( holds it up to show Marv, then tosses it with disregard into the bushes ) I’ve got just the thing to fix it though. ( returns to the Jaguar and opens it’s trunk. He digs for a moment, then pulls out an air hose and a small wooden box and returns to the Mazda trailing the hose ) Camel patches! ( holds open the box to Marv ) They work great, especially if you’re four wheeling someplace where no one can tow you, even if they could find you! ( plugs in a patch where the nail was, then fills the tire with air and checks for leaks with puddle water. Marv approaches the Jaguar as The Poet coils the air hose and puts it and the box away. )   Marv: ( astonished ) That’s amazing! You even have an air compressor in there! This car is fantastic. Where did you get it? You build it yourself?   The Poet: ( closes the trunk and caresses the car lovingly ) Sure did! It took three and a half years, and lots of energy, but I finally did it. This is my prototype for ‘Toys For The Rich, Unlimited’, a business venture of mine. ( he moves around the car to the driver’s door and opens it. Marv follows him and peers inside. )   Marv: ( impressed ) Wow, this is really great! ( then speaks hesitantly ) Oh, uh- can I offer you anything for helping me? Ur,I’m Marv by the way, ( holds out his hand to be shaken )   The Poet: ( shakes Marv’s hand while holding the other out, palm up ) That’ll be seventy five dollars for roadside service if you please. ( Marv’s jaw drops as he pulls his hand back in shock ) Relax, I’m only kidding! Actually, I enjoy playing the Good Samaritan. Strangers shouldn’t be afraid to help out one another, don’t you think. Considering we all share the same planet, how can we truly be strangers?... ( he climbs into the Jag and starts the engine, staring out the windshield ) Anyway... I don’t know.... ( shakes his head and looks down to Marv ) Hey, do you like to read by the way?   Marv: ( shrugs ) Ur,yeah,sure.. Why?   The Poet: ( reaches into the glove box, pulls out a poem and hands it to Marv ) A little gift from a maniac. I gotta go! Have a nice night, and remember, they’re called camel patches. ( revs the motor nurturingly ) Take it easy! ( closes his door and drives off, giving a short toot on his air horns )   Marv: ( faintly ) Bye. ( opens the poem and reads the first line in an odd tone ) You’re one eye ( his recitation is overshadowed by The Poet’s voice-over ) and I’m the other We share of the same brain but still we can’t agree upon the objects at which we strain For I see close and you see far instead of eye to eye And what becomes of all this mess is enough to make me cry...   Scene 5   11:15 PM. Opens in Leslie’s bedroom. Central is a large bed with a pink satin coverlet and a white lace canopy above it. The walls are painted a creamy white and soft lighting is provided by a Miss Piggy lamp on a bedside table to the left on the back wall. To the right rear, a rack stereo system and a collection of cassettes and CD’s climb to the ceiling on white-painted shelves. Next to that, on the right wall, is a pink enamel vanity with a large mirror surrounded by unlit rose-shaded bulbs, and a white padded stool . A princess telephone with an answering machine rests on top of the vanity amid a litter of various cosmetic bottles. Right forefront is a plain white door with a Southern Comfort calendar hanging on it.. Dominating the left wall is a life-size photo-poster of Richland hung on a closet door, next to which is a pink enamel bureau. The room has numerous dolls arranged around, the largest of which is a three foot Raggedy Ann sitting against the bed’s headboard. Turning on the mirror lights, Leslie stands before the vanity, primping. Ketcham lies across the bed on her left side, with her head supported by one hand, the other holding the poem “Deja Vu” before her and the rose is on the bed in front of her. Leslie reaches down to play back the answering machine, then continues primping.   Richland:( voice-over from answering machine ) Hi, hon! I’m back from the Windy City. Listen, I spoke with George and he told me there’s going to be a Viking funeral for Walter at the Cold Spring Basin. Something about a last request that we should all be together. ( chuckles ) They’re going to sail his ashes into eternity. That’s Walter for you! Anyway, it starts at midnight. We have to leave from Club Mud. Marvin is going to drive me, so will you meet me there? Luv’ya, bye.   Leslie: ( shutting off machine ) A Viking funeral? I thought he was an American. ( laughs vicariously )   Ketcham: ( rolls onto her stomach ) Leslie, do you know how Walter died? No one seems to know. Walter’s brother, George, won’t even tell me. ( pushes the poem away from her )   Leslie: ( sits down and adjusts her make-up ) Well, I can’t say I know anything for sure, but I think Walter had been depressed ever since the two of you broke up.   Ketcham: ( bolting to her feet she knocks the rose to the floor ) Oh, come on, that was years ago! ( she bends to pick up the rose ) Wait a minute! ( flinches and pulls a thorn from her fingertip ) You don’t mean he...? ( droppping the thorn in a small garbage pail beneath the bedside table, she sucks blood from her finger )   Leslie: ( continuing to primp, she eyes Ketcham’s reaction in the mirror ) Like I said, I don’t know anything, But Walter as never the same since then. Three years, and he never got over it.   Ketcham: ( defensively ) I never went out with him! We were just friends. I told him that! Besides, I can’t be held responsible for whatever he may have done.   Leslie: Cut it out, Ketch. Face it, Walter weirded out, he stopped hanging around with everyone at Club Mud, and when he was there, he was always quiet and withdrawn. I swear the guy never laughed anymore.   Ketcham: ( exclamatory, nearing anger ) He was obsessed with me! I had to get away from him! He even proposed to me when we met in France, and I’d only known him a couple of days. That’s why I moved to the city, and he still tried to find me. He’d leave flowers under my windshield wiper whenever I’d visit my parents, he’d send me poetry like this. ( she picks up “Deja Vu”, waves it in the air, then throws it down onto the foot of the bed )   Leslie: ( checking the time on her watch, she stands hurriedly ) I don’t want to talk about this anymore. I’m already late to meet Richland. I have to leave.( turns off the vanity lights and moves towards door, speaking over her shoulder ) Care to come along? Walter held a torch for you in life, maybe you can hold it for him in death.   Ketcham: ( with a sour face ) Real funny! ( calming down somewhat ) I might as well! I haven’t seen anyone from Club Mud in a while.   Leslie: ( walks to the closet and takes out a black trench coat ) Do you want to borrow a raincoat? It’s wet out.   Ketcham: ( moves towards her ) Sure. ( Leslie gives the coat to Ketcham ) Thanks... Did Rich say Marvelous Marv was going to be there?   Leslie: ( pulling a gray raincoat out for herself ) Probably, he’s driving Richland there. Why?   Ketcham: ( as they leave ) I never could stand that geek.   Scene 6  12:15 AM. Opens on Club Mud marina, Huntington, Long Island. The rain has stopped, but wind gusts cause masts to ping in the background. Laid out in a large T, the main dock has fingers extending for each pair of boats. For the most part, the boats are weathered wooden wrecks, but an occasional fiberglass speedboat stands out amid these sore thumbs. Pagoda lights line the sagging and twisted docks. On the main dock, which runs across the stage, Richland and Marv sit on coolers drinking Heineken from cans. We can now see Richland is wearing dirty white baker’s pants and old leather thong sandals, as well as the polo shirt. Behind them is a large black and tan barge that has been converted to a houseboat with camouflage colored sails. From up in the hills, off to the right, a woman is practicing an aria with unnerving ability. Occasional low laughter from the various dock residents can also be heard.   Richland: ( in a sullen tone ) Women ( crushes his can reflexively ) Can’t live with’em, can’t shoot them when you’re done. ( he throws the empty can into the water in front of him, making a faint splash, then reaches into his cooler and gets another beer )   Marv: ( amused ) Sexist pig! ( snickering, he raises his can in cheers ) I like it! ( they both drink as Richland peers down the dock to the right )   Richland: ( indignantly ) Where the hell is she?!   Marv: ( conciliatory ) Do you want to try calling her again?   Richland ( petulantly ) I’m not going to waste another quarter! I spend too much on her as it is! Half my life I’ve been waiting on her. She’s got five more minutes, then we’re leavin’ without her. ( enter The Poet stage right, striding hurriedly. )   Marv: ( surprised to see The Poet, he stands quickly ) Hey, check out who it is, it’s the poet, the guy with the monster Jag!   The Poet: ( stopping, he shakes Marv’s hand, and looks to Richland who doesn’t react ) The Poet— now that has a nice ring to it! ( chuckles ) What are you guys doing here?   Marv: ( boasts ) We’re going to a Viking funeral at the Sand Hole, you know, the Cold Spring Basin. ( nods in Richland’s direction ) Just waiting for his girlfriend. ( the sounds of women approaching can be heard from stage right )   The Poet: ( casts his eyes rightward, then quickly back to Marv ) I’m looking for Myron the dock master. Do you know where his boat is?   Richland: ( waves vaguely left stage ) Straight down the main dock, make a right at the end, Myron’s is the last boat on the left, the Black Cloud.   The Poet: ( amicably ) Thanks, take it easy. ( moves down the dock, exiting stage left as Leslie and Ketcham enter stage right )   Marv: ( excitedly ) Hey, Rich, here she is. Who’s that with her?   Richland: ( recognizing Ketcham ) Holy shit( jumps up ) blast from the past! Oh, what a Ketch! ( steps forward to give Ketcham a big hug and a kiss, then holding her at arm’s length he eyes her leeringly up and down ) Damn, you’re looking good! How long has it been anyway?   Ketcham: ( stepping back, she shakes her head ) Not long enough.   Marv: ( sheepishly ) Same old Ketch, um... how’s city life?   Leslie: ( insinuates herself under Richland’s arm, holding him possessively) Where’s my hello?   Richland: ( pecks her on the cheek ) Hi, hon. You’re late. What took you so long?   Ketcham: ( apologetically ) It was my fault. I got out of work late, so we missed the early train.   Leslie: ( examines the area ) Where is everyone? Are we the only ones who came?   Richland: ( obsequiously ) No, most everyone already went to the Sand Hole, but Myron left me the keys to the launch because we had to wait for you.   Marv: ( anxiously ) We should get going!   Richland ( grabs Leslie’s arm gently and glances at her watch ) Yeah, you’re right. Let’s go. Leslie, grab an end of this. ( Richland and Leslie pick up one cooler, exiting stage left as Marv grabs one handle of the second cooler and looks expectantly towards Ketcham. She returns his look, crosses her arms, and exits stage left, leaving Marv standing alone appearing dumbfounded. )   Scene 7   1:00 AM. Opens on Long Island Sound. The wind has picked up drastically, causing white caps to break over the gunnels of a whale-bellied World’s Fair launch, within which are Richland, Leslie, Marv and Ketcham. Richland is at the helm when the motor is heard to sputter and stall. Cursing and gesticulating, Richland attempts to restart the motor without success. The others start to bail the swamping boat as it rocks furiously. All have to shout to be heard over the howling wind.   Richland: ( slams his fist onto the console and yells ) Alamatta Pingga!!! Twice in a day breaking down! This is too much. Let’s try to paddle our way to shore. ( All start to paddle with various boat accoutrements, but no one seems to know which direction to go. Stopping, they appear confused and search around)   Ketcham: ( points to port side ) Over there! Is that land? I see a light!   Marv: ( all-knowingly ) No! That’s a buoy. It’s blinking. Land should be that way. ( points to starboard as the launch grinds to a halt in the sand. Marv falls face first into Ketcham’s chest, tumbles over, and spills the cooler onto Leslie’s feet. Marv scrambles up quickly, bumping into Richland and almost knocking him overboard. ) Oh, shit! I’m sorry!   Ketcham: ( scornfully ) Tell me I’m wrong! ( moves to the bow away from Marv ) Get lost!   Richland: ( helping Leslie to replace the cans into the cooler ) ASSHOLE!   Leslie: ( shaking off her feet ) He is! ( Ketcham removes her slippers and slides off the bow to find herself standing on a beach with waves crashing over her feet. Taking the anchor from the forward deck, she plants it firmly in the sand above the tide line)   Richland: ( commandingly ) Let’s go see what that light is. ( moves to the bow ) Leslie: ( whiningly ) Do you think we should? It’s private property, isn’t it?   Marv: ( opens a beer and gulps from it repeatedly ) Would you rather stay out here all night?! ( jumping over the port gunnel, he lands waist deep in water, then splashes to the shore )   Leslie: ( assesses the situation ) I guess not. ( moves to the bow and gets out aided by Richland. All exit stage left as the rain again begins to fall )   Scene 8   1:30 AM. Opens in front of L’Abbaye de Flavigny, which is on a hill overlooking the Long Island Sound. The rain continues as lightning silhouettes the monolithic structure. A stone stairway center stage leads to large arched wooden doors. To the right of the stair’ are windows through one of which can be seen the blue flickering light of a television. The rest of the building is shrouded in darkness. Richland, Leslie, Marv and Ketcham enter stage right.   Richland: ( peering up at the building as lightning flashes ) Kinda eerie, hunh? ( the group stops at the foot of the stairs hesitantly, then Ketcham steps forward and climbs the stairs to knock on the door firmly. Protectively Richland sprints up the steps and gently pulls Ketcham aside as floodlights illuminate the face of a cut-stone three story building which is constructed in a peculiar architectural style with a red flat tile roof. The first and third floor windows are tall and wide with arched tops, while those on the second floor are small and oval. The Butler opens the right hand door and steps out. He is short, frail and aged with a greenish complexion, short white hair, and piercing blue eyes. Dressed in a black butler’s uniform with a red velvet liner to his vest, his shirt and gloves are a spotless white, contrasting his polished black shoes. )   The Butler: ( speaks with a paused deliberateness, but politely ) May I help you?   Ketcham: ( stepping forward again ) Excuse me, sir, we’re sorry to bother you so late but our boat broke down on your beach, and we saw your TV set.. ( points to the glow in the window ) We were hoping maybe we could use your telephone. We’d really appreciate it.   Marv: ( interjecting ) It would only be a local call.   The Butler: ( examines the group suspiciously ) The master is out at the moment, and doesn’t believe in phones. However, if you will follow me, I will gladly let you use my private phone. ( ushers all inside and closes the door )   Scene 9  1:40 AM. Opens on the same group standing in the parlour. To the right is a wide flight of cut interlocking stone stairs with no railings, climbing to a landing with large arched stained glass windows in the background. From here another flight of stone stairs rises to the foreground on the left side, above which is a tremendous cathedral ceiling. Beneath the left stairs, a hallway with many etched glass doors extends to rear stage and the courtyard beyond. The floor is checkered black-and-white marble and the walls are of a whitewashed cut stone. Eight suits of armour line each side of the room and there is a carved oak doorway on the right. The lighting is flaming torches set into the walls at strategic intervals. All four players look about astonished while The Butler waits for their attention patiently.   Richland: ( impassioned, he waves his arm indicating the decor ) Can you believe this place. This is the life!   Leslie: ( with shrill excitement ) I didn’t know anything like this existed on Long Island!   Ketcham: ( perplexed, she chews her fingernail in deep thought ) This place seems familiar. I could swear I’ve been here before. The layout is exactly like a monastery I visited in the middle of France, ( turns to the others ) where I met Walter.   The Butler: Flavigny sur Ozerain, perhaps? In Burgundy? This is the Abbey of Flavigny, it was moved stone by stone in 1987, and modified to be somewhat more luxurious than what the monks were accustomed to.   Ketcham: ( reminiscing with wondrous eyes ) My God! This is it! ( with pain in her voice ) This is where Walter proposed to me.   Marv and Richland: ( both astonished, speaking simultaneously ) Walter proposed to you?!   The Butler: ( breaks in with a quizzical expression on his face ) This way, if you please, to the phone. I hope you don’t mind the untidiness. ( The Butler leads the group through the carved oak door stage right )   Scene 10   The Butler’s bedroom is spacious with lofty ceilings. To the right foreground is a king-size bed with an elaborately carved headboard, behind which is a lacquered wooden chest of drawers with an ornamental brass lamp and an assortment of bottles and candles on top of it. Against the left wall, fore-front, is a set of shelves with a collection of animal skulls and fossils. The door leading to the parlour is between it and a large metal cabinet in the back left corner which is eight feet tall, four feet wide, painted a dark green, and covered with a variety of automotive stickers. Next to the cabinet, on the back wall, is a grey steel office desk with a green glass student lamp, a black electric typewriter, and a wide screen TV which is covered with static snow, the sound of which fills the room. On the walls are posters and mementoes from around the world. In the center of the back wall is a short wide bureau which matches the chest of drawers. Upon it stands a four foot tall plaster angel with bare feet and spread golden wings. She is clad in a pearlescent sky—blue robe, bound about the waist with a braided golden rope. In her right hand she holds a lit torchiere, in her left is a bottle of Perrier held close to her body with a blue and white bandanna draped over her forearm. She has wavy blond hair with green and yellow leis appearing to hold her hair back from her face. Her mystical blue eyes are made of glass and seem almost human. At her feet is the phone which the Butler gestures towards. As Richland picks it up and dials, the Butler turns off the television.   The Butler: ( stands with his arms behind his back ) The storm must have knocked out the cable. ( Richland speaks on the phone indistinguishably, while the others curiously observe the contents of the room )   Leslie: ( sits on the edge of the bed ) This is an, umm, interesting room.   Marv: ( poking the angel in the eye curiously ) Definitely! You must have done a lot of travelling?   The Butler: ( uncomfortably ) I did in my younger days, but now I only travel with the master.   Ketcham: ( approaches the Butler ) Who is the master anyway? What does he do for a living?   The Butler: ( resuming his calculated manner ) Out of respect for his privacy, I can not tell you his name; I will tell you he is a recluse and has no need to work for a living.   Richland: ( hangs up the phone and interrupts ) No one can come get us until tomorrow morning. Would it be alright if we slept in the boat on your beach?   The Butler: ( steps towards the door ) That is fine. I regret I can not invite you to stay here without the master’s permission. He prefers solitude, and has been quite moody of late. If, when he returns ( glancing at his watch, he opens the door ) he says it is acceptable, I will come find you and bring you up. Do you need blankets, or anything else?   Marv: ( nonchantly ) We’ll be okay. We’re really grateful for your help. It’s no problem sleeping on the boat.   The Butler: ( gestures to the exit ) Let me see you to the door.   Scene 11   3:00 AM.. Opens back at the launch which is sitting in the mud because the tide has gone partially out. The players busy themselves setting up camp. Richland pulls a canvas from a compartment in the stern of the launch, and spreads it out with the help of Marv over the bow, leaving one corner through which access may be had. Leslie tries to block the fierce wind from blowing out a small fire she and Ketcham have made, as the latter wanders in search of wood for the fire. Richland and Marv finish the shelter and lean against the side of the launch, watching the woman work.   Richland: ( condescendingly ) I don’t know why you two are making a fire, it won’t keep us dry in the boat. ( the rain starts to come down in buckets, causing the fire to sizzle out, as Ketcham drops an armful of wood to run to the shelter of the launch. All four climb in and pull the canvas shut behind them. Shortly thereafter Leslie is heard to moan... )   Leslie: We’ll be fine. No bother to sleep on the boat! What do you think we are... DUCKS!   Richland: ( grumpily ) I don’t know why I bothered to come, never liked Walter anyway. ( several moments pass, then headlights flash across the boat, and a rumble from a motor can be heard, when suddenly The Poet’s Jaguar floats airborne from over a dune, lands sideways, and slides to a stop about five feet away from the launch )   Richland: ( paws at the canvas trying to find an edge ) WHAT THE... ( he flips back the canvas exposing everyone within, who stand as The Poet opens his door and climbs down )   The Poet: ( pleasantly surprised ) There you people are, everyone at the Sand Hole was worried about you. What happened?   Marv: The damn boat broke down. Not my night I guess.   Ketcham: ( holds a boat cushion over her head to keep herself from getting wet ) Hey, I know you! You’re the poet, aren’t you? We met in the park today.   Leslie: ( moving behind Richland ) You’re right, it’s him! ( Richland and Marv share a mistrustful glance )   Richland: ( indignantly ) What is it with this guy, he’s everywhere I go today?   The Poet: ( offended ) What’s your problem, you’re on my beach, I live here! If you want to sleep somewhere warmer than under a wet canvas, you’d better learn some manners. If you’d rather, I’ll leave you to fend for yourself! ( Richland begins to respond hostilely, but is stopped when Ketcham gives him a sharp elbow to the stomach )   Ketcham: ( apologetically ) I’m sorry. We’d really appreciate your hospitality. It’s miserable out here.   The Poet: ( smiles at Ketcham ) Grab your stuff and hop in the back seat. ( he opens the back door and folds down a step which has been tucked beneath the running board) I’ll drive you up to the house.   Marv: ( seeming pleased ) Cool!!! ( they all gather their possessions, step from the launch and pile into the back seat of the Jaguar. The Poet pulls himself into the driver’s seat, starts the engine, and drives away aggressively leaving the launch unattended with the canvas hanging half off. )   Scene 12   3:45 AM. Opens in the dining room of the Abbey.Lengthwise to center stage is a table made of heavy oak timbers which is thirty feet long and nine feet wide. The room’s dimensions are a massive sixty by forty with a thirty foot ceiling which, from a central point directly over the table, arches in many different directions. From this point hangs a huge crystal chandelier with well over one hundred candles providing light for dining; placed strategically throughout the room are torches in floor stands. Two cow-roasting size fireplaces are at a full blaze, and are situated to either side of the ends of the table along the back wall; between them is a set of stained glass windows which are fifteen feet high by five feet wide. The window on the left depicts a blazing sun and a lone dead tree in a barren valley with vultures circling above. The window on the right depicts the same location, but with a golden quarter moon high over a meadow within which stands the silhouette of a healthy tree. The walls are panelled with intricately carved ebony. To the left is a doorway with etched glass doors in the open position; on the right is a bar with smoked mirrors lining the wall behind it. Shelves are mounted the face of each mirror, upon which are many different liquors. The bar is of the same material as the table, and has a line of beer taps on one end and a line of ice buckets on the other. Knick knacks are spread between them with a small crystal vase holding a single red rose in the center. Around the table are a number of heavy wooden chairs, but the one center stage, backside of the table, is closer to a throne than the rest and is twice as large. Of a polished white marble, the floors reflect the firelight. Enter The Poet and the players with two burly Irish wolfhounds, one white and the other silver, trailing them. The dogs stroll over to the left fireplace and lounge to bask in the heat as the players dry themselves with beach towels.   The Poet: ( motions for all to sit along the back edge of the table ) Please be seated. ( takes Ketcham by the hand and leads her to the throne-like chair ) You can be the queen! ( he seats her and plops down beside her on the right. Leslie sits immediately to the left of Ketcham, with Richland beside her and Marv takes the seat next to him. The Butler enters and collects the towels, then walks over to whisper something into The Poet’s ear. The Poet smiles at Ketcham, yet has a troubled expression on his face. Exit the Butler. )   Ketcham: ( examines the room, then The Poet ) So you must have known Walter, you did say you went to the funeral, didn’t you?   The Poet:Sure I knew Walter. This was his home until recently. Walter left me in charge of his estate on his deathbed!   Leslie and Ketcham: ( in unison turn to each other ) Walter’s!!!   Leslie: ( mind-boggled ) Walter never said anything about this house!   Richland ( accusingly ) C’mon, where would Walter have gotten money for a place this big?!   Marv: ( disbelievingly ) Walter worked doing demolition, he drove a ratty old car! Are you sure we’re talking about the same person? ( the white wolfhound rises and lollops over to The Poet and forces it’s head beneath his right hand, demanding attention )   The Poet: ( scratching the hound’s ear ) Walter De Zorzi, right? He was a very unique person if you got to know him, then again, none of you ever took the time, did you? Walter was a much different person then he may have led you to believe. ( firmly pushes the dog away and rests his folded hands on the table ) He was always rich, ever since his parents died when he was eight and left him half of the De Zorzi oil fortune. He never told people that because it would have affected how people treated him. Walter wanted to be loved for who he was, not for his money.   Ketcham: ( reaches out and latches onto the dog’s collar, pulling it near and scratching it’s chest as it sits ) I don’t understand all this, why would Walter have thought it could possibly make a difference to us? We were his friends, weren’t we? ( pauses briefly from complying with the hound’s demands ) And what about the old boat, the “Sans Souci”, I thought he lived there?   The Poet:The “Sans Souci” was mine until it sank, he just borrowed it so you wouldn’t know the truth about where he lived. That boat was in my family for over thirty years.... ( shaking his head, he leans forward to speak to the others ) You all may have known Walter in one way or another, but I’ll bet none of you knew when was his birthday, what his favourite color was, or how he felt about life. I probably know more about each of you, and I’m what you might call a perfect stranger, than what all of you combined really knew about Walter. Take you for instance, ( leans further over to see Richland eye-to-eye ) you always treated Walter like a God-damned idiot, never having a nice thing to say, doing things to hurt him behind his back. Did you really think you were so much smarter...did you think he didn’t see?   Richland: ( stands with clenched fists ) What in the hell do you know! ( the silver hound leaps to its feet and growls menacingly at Richland as Marv pulls him quickly back into his chair )   The Poet: ( confronts Leslie ) And you! You would have killed Walter rather than to let the truth come out about the night you seduced him on the Black Cloud. Do you have any idea how much that hurt him, and helped to further isolate him? You took from him his pride. You and your stupid sheep jokes. ( Leslie sobs and cries as Richland gives her a disgusted glare )   Marv: ( realizes he is next ) I never did a thing to him, so don’t blame me!   The Poet: ( vehemently ) You never did a thing! Walter trusted you with his friendship, and you betrayed him and ignored him. You were the only person that Walter even considered telling the truth to regarding his wealth. ( Marv starts to protest but is cut short by Ketcham )   Ketcham:I already know how I hurt Walter, you don’t have to get into it!   The Poet: ( changing to a sweeter disposition ) To the contrary, you’re the only hope Walter ever found in life. You gave him something to dream of, to believe in. Walter never stopped loving you, not even on his deathbed. ( enter the Butler )   The Butler: ( bows subserviently ) Dinner is ready, sir. Shall I have it brought in?   The Poet: ( searches his guests’ faces ) If no one objects? ( nods yes to the Butler who then exits )   Ketcham: ( placing a hand on The Poet’s elbow ) Would you mind telling me what Walter died of?   The Poet: ( putting his hand on hers ) It’s simple. Ironic though it may seem, Walter died from the strain and pain of hope. He no longer could bear living in what he knew was a lie, so he just gave up! ( the white dog shoves between them, separating their hands and resting it’s noble head on the table)   Ketcham: ( patting the dog ) Are you saying he just willed himself to death- I don’t believe it’s possible. ( enter the Butler followed by six servants with platters filled with food, dishes and various other things. The Butler oversees as the servants set the table with silverware, napkins, flowers, assorted dishes, wines, and water. Three servants exit, the remaining three, who are female, take positions behind Ketcham, as the Butler serves soup. The Poet abstains with a wave of his hand.)   Richland: ( shoving his soup away, he declares ) If Walter felt that way towards us, why did he even bother to hang around Club Mud? What, was he a glutton for punishment? ( The Poet signals over the Butler and whispers briefly into his ear. As the Butler exits, The Poet directs his attention to Richland. )   The Poet: ( trying to maintain his composure ) Do you have any idea what it’s like to have no friends, and almost no family? Walter was happy even to be abused by you, at least it was an acknowledgement that he was alive!!   Marv: ( sloppily spooning his soup ) Hey, if Walter was such a loser that he couldn’t make friends, why should any one of us be responsible for that?   The Poet: ( emotionally ) You think he didn’t try to make friends? Walter was no loser, you people are the losers! You couldn’t see beyond money and fame, that the only thing that really counts in life is love. Walter knew, he never forgot it! ( enter four servants with the second course. They serve the food, clear the soup dishes, then leave.) You may think it was just bad luck that brought us all together tonight, but you’re wrong. The boat breaking down and your landing here was pure coincidence, as was our meeting on the expressway, but I must confess, Ketcham, I followed you to the park. I wanted to try to justify Walter’s obsession with you. The Viking funeral is where Walter wanted his will to be read... and all of you are in his will! ( the Butler enters with the will in hand ) Richland: ( incredulously ) Why would he leave anything to us? We all treated him like shit, didn’t we?   The Poet: ( taking the will from the Butler ) Not all of you. ( looks to Ketcham ) Yet Walter didn’t, unlike me, hold it against you anyway. He never expected any of you to be more than human, and if you really knew Walter, you would know he loved all mankind despite those obvious flaws you seem to be such good examples of.   Richland: ( standing up angrily, he sits quickly at the prompting of the both wolfhounds, who move over to sit behind his chair ) What the heck makes you so good that you can put us down like this!   The Poet: ( reddening in the face ) Nothing makes me any better or worse. I at least am willing to admit my flaws, and I, like Walter, have tried to do something about it....   Marv: ( demandingly ) Well, what have you done?   Leslie: ( peevishly ) Yeah! So far all you are is a troublemaker and a big mouth! ( gulps down a big glass of wine which one of the servants behind Ketcham immediately refills )   The Poet: ( skims over the first few pages of the will briefly ) As to what I have tried to do about it, I have written poetry to tens of thousands of people just like all of you. Maybe no one ever understood what I was trying to communicate, how truly important love really is, yet at the very least I have tried. Can any of you make such a claim?( all try to avoid The Poet’s eyes as he gazes into each one’s face. The next course is brought in and served, then The Poet makes a motion with his hand and all servants as well as the Butler exit. The Poet begins to read from the will. )   And to Miss Leslie Blackwater, I leave my country estates in France, along with all incomes produced by said properties. To Mr. Richland Logico, I leave Castle No-Surrender in Castleiney, Ireland. To Mr. Marvelous Marvin, I leave my collection of vintage cars, housed on my brother’s estate in the Florida Keys, along with a lifetime yearly income of two hundred thousand dollars. ( pauses then continues in a softer voice ) And to Ms.. Ketcham Colleen Orelse, I leave the remainder of my assets, valued at one billion, two hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars on the one condition that she accept from my dearest friend, and the executor of my estate, the full collection of poetry, written to her and on which he has labored so hard. I also wish to apologize to her for not actually having been the author of the poems she has received throughout the years. ( The Poet puts down the will and waits for a response to what he has just read )   Ketcham: ( confused ) You mean it was you all these years who wrote the poems?   Marv: ( jumping around ecstatically ) I’m rich, I can’t believe it, I’m RICH!   Leslie: ( tears pour down her cheeks as she wipes her eyes and leans back dreamily in her seat )In France. I always wanted to go to France, how could this possibly be...   Richland: ( walks bravely over to The Poet and snatches the will from the table, flipping through the pages furiously ) There’s got to be some sort of a catch! What is this, a joke?! And what do you get from all this?   The Poet: ( smugly ) Aside from the satisfaction of watching you act like animals- nothing- nor do I want anything!   Ketcham: ( raises eyes to heaven as if talking to God ) Oh Walter, it didn’t have to be this way.... ( The Poet rises, walks over behind the bar, produces a leather bound book of poetry, and snatches the rose from the vase, both of which he then hands to Ketcham )   The Poet:It couldn’t have been any other way, nor can for me it be any other way. You deserve what Walter gave you! ( takes Ketcham’s hand and kisses it lightly ) I, like Walter, believe in love, In its power and its pains, and like Walter, love for me is only from afar. All those years of writing poems to that ultimate love in my imagination, and finally here you are… a goddess, a devil. My hope, yet hope can only exist in dreams, for a dream come true is suddenly no more than a reality. ( a single tear glides down his cheek, exit The Poet, followed by both dogs )   Scene 13   Opens on the Alice-in-Wonderland exhibit in the dead of night. There is a full moon shining brightly in the background, yet the statues’ surroundings are shrouded in a hazy darkness. The Pointless One, unchanged, stands facing Alice.   The Pointless One: ( with great sorrow ) What I would like from you... ( The Poet’s voice joins in simultaneously ) is the chance to hear you sing And the time to make you smile simple, basic types of things To stand laughing in the rain watch the rainbow when it ends Hold your hand beneath the moon share the special love of friends Talk of life and what it means how we two can make it last What is new and every day capture memories of the past Touch the fiber of your heart knowing there I have a place That your ear will always hear not in shame tomorrow face To be able to express without fear of you so dear Just how strong I truly care in my arms I want you near With a purpose to exist me for you and you for me Where we both can grow in joy This too much to ask for free...   ( turning to the audience with a tear in his eye, The Pointless One pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots himself in the heart, dropping to the ground. )   Scene 14   Opens outside the closed entrance gates to the Abbey; it is a crisp winter day. The twin gates are fifteen feet high and made of iron bars painted green. To either side, supporting them, are twelve foot gray granite pillars topped with green marble griffins. Bordering the road in the foreground are ten foot red brick walls extending from the pillars. Through the gates can be seen a blue stone driveway stretching a quarter-mile back to the Abbey which is framed by a clear sky. The driveway is edged in cobblestones and the gardens to either side are blanketed with snow. Between the pillars and the road is a wide cement apron. Mounted on the pillar to the right is an ornamental brass letter box. On the shoulder of the road to the left, The Poet’s Jaguar is parked with the motor running. To the rear of the Jag stands The Poet dressed in work boots, blue jeans and a white T-shirt with a caricature of a blue-green Earth, below which in large black letters is printed “Don’t Blow It”. The Poet paces with his arms crossed and shoulders hunched against the cold wind, and a cigarette dangles from his lips. Enter the Butler, dressed in “uniform” with a Navy-blue topcoat, gray rubber boots, and a gray fur Homburg. The Butler opens the right gate, sees The Poet and moves towards him with an expression of paternal concern.   The Butler: ( with uncharacteristic warmth ) Good morning, sir, how was your night?   The Poet: ( removes the cigarette from his mouth ) Laboured... not much time for sleep. You know me. ( glides to the driver’s door as the Butler follows) How’bout you? ( opening the door, he takes a manila folder from the front seat )   The Butler: ( scratches himself behind the ear ) Miss Ketcham was up late.   The Poet :( takes a last draw from his cigarette then flicks it away ) How did she react to “Yesterdays”?   The Butler: ( adjusts coat against the cold ) As she always has. Not being able to respond troubles her deeply. If I may, I’ve always felt the best way to resolve a dilemma is to face it. ( pauses thoughtfully, then speaks in a guarded tone ) I think the time has come for you to speak with her. It has been over two years.   The Poet: ( kicking slush from beneath his feet, he makes a spot to stand in ) I can’t. You know I can’t. To be rejected would end my illusions of hope, and without hope I can not dream.   The Butler: ( with alarm ) I’m sorry, but I saw what dreaming did to Walter; it killed him. ( reflectively ) A dream must be moved towards an end in reality, or it consumes the dreamer. I can see no other way.   The Poet: ( with conviction ) The life of a poet is the dream. God has plagued me with this heart, the tragedy being it is all I am. I’ve always valued your advice before but I can not follow it now. And I can see no other way.   The Butler: ( at a loss ) I don’t know what to say.   The Poet: ( looks at the folder then hands it to the Butler reluctantly ) There is nothing to say. ( sighs ) Well, I gotta go. See you later. ( climbs into the Jaguar and drives off, leaving theButler looking after him. The Butler turns and picks up the mail from the box, goes inside the gate and closes it behind him. )   Scene 15   Opens in the Abbey’s dining room the same morning. Ketcham sits alone in the throne-like chair dressed in a black silk robe and barefoot, sipping slowly at a cup of coffee. The lighting is provided by sunlight through the stained glass and the glowing embers of the fireplace to the right. The other fireplace has been stacked with kindling but is not lit. Enter a maid, dressed as such, with a large vase full of red roses.   Maid: ( with a heavy French accent ) Pardon, mademoiselle. Where is it you would like me to these put?   Ketcham: ( puts down her coffee cup ) Put these... Marie Isabelle, put these. ( shrugs noncommittally ) Oh, I don’t know, anywhere will do. ( the maid places the vase onto the right side of the table then exits. Enter Marv dressed in a black tuxedo with a bright yellow bow-tie and yellowish shoes. )   Marv: ( resting his elbows on the chair back to Ketcham’s left ) How’ya doin’, Ketch?   Ketcham: ( turning up from her coffee with an annoyed face ) All right, Marv.   Marv: ( nods in the direction of the roses ) I see the madman hasn’t given up yet. ( sits to Ketcham’s right )   Ketcham: ( tenaciously ) Marv, I really wish you would stop referring to him as a madman. He is eccentric, I’ll grant you that, but at least he isn’t a geek.   Marv: ( appearing offended, he fidgets nervously ) C’mon, Ketch, the guy sends you flowers and poetry but won’t let you know where he lives, or even talk to you face to face. You gonna tell me he isn’t just slightly off his rocker.. Jesus, he only met you twice and he thinks he’s madly in love with you. What about that poem you showed me, Day—jah View”, do you think you met him in another life?   Ketcham: ( picking up her cup, she peers into it and speaks softly ) I don’t know.., maybe. You wouldn’t understand, you couldn’t, you’re exactly the opposite of him. ( drinks some coffee, then speaks firmly ) You probably represent everything in man he hates!   Marv: ( stands huffily ) Yeah- I have money and he has nothing. It’s no wonder he hates me when I represent everything he can’t have. ( he reaches over and breaks a rose from its stem and sticks it into his lapel)   Ketcham: ( stridently ) Everything he didn’t want! ( Marv walks behind the bar, mixes a Bloody Mary in a large glass, and downs half of it in one gulp. Enter the Butler, sans outerwear, who hands Ketcham the mail, and then the manila folder he received earlier. )   The Butler: ( in his customary manner ) This arrived with the morning mail, miss.   Ketcham: ( points at the roses ) When did the roses come?   The Butler: ( at ease with his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes forward ) Late last night, miss. I discovered them on the veranda. If I may, Miss Ketcham, the fundraiser for the homeless of New York City is at noon today; should I bring cash again? If so, how much, and at what time would you like to depart? ( stepping back from the table with a slight bow, he moves to light the left fireplace )   Ketcham: ( following his movement with her head ) Bring cash... I don’t know... do you think fifty thousand is enough, or should it be more?   Marv: ( drops his glass, which shatters at his feet, and leans across the bar, bug-eyed ) You’re INSANE !!! How long do you think your money will last if you keep wasting it on bums and degenerates?   Ketcham ( glares at Marv with great distaste ) I don’t care what you think! ( sitting straight in her chair, she picks up the folder and looks at it, speaking almost to herself ) I would give it all away if my lawyers would let me. ( faces the Butler ) Have the car out front at ten. I want to stop in Central Park for a while before it starts.   The Butler: Thank you, miss. ( the Butler, seeing the fire is lit, rises and exits )   Marv: ( insultingly ) That damned poet went and poisoned your brain, You’re getting to be as crazy as he is!( Ketcham pushes away her coffee, stands and as she exits the room with the folder, she speaks over her shoulder )   Ketcham: Fuck you too, Marv.   Marv: ( moves from behind the bar, crunching glass under-foot, and sits in the throne ) If she wasn’t so rich, I’d probably hate her.   Scene 16   Opens on the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, same day, late morning. The Poet crawls groggily from under a bush left stage. He is dressed the same as earlier, but now has draped over his shoulders a beige blanket with Aqueduct Raceway stencilled across it in blue. Snow covers the ground with the exception of the pathways which have been shovelled. It is sunny yet very windy. The Poet watches scraps of paper scattering before the gusts, and joins the dancing litter holding the blanket as a sail. The wind carries him as he light-footedly skips to center stage, coming to a halt before Alice and bowing with a cavalier sweep of the blanket.   The Poet: ( brushes the top of the giant mushroom clear of snow and climbs up to have a seat )Mornin’, Princess- and how is everyone? What’ll it be today? ( directed at Alice ) A love poem declaring unending passion, ( to the Mad Hatter ) a poem about that nameless misery? ( pulling a small pad and pen from his back pocket, he flips to the last page ) I know, a poem about new shoes ( turns to the White Rabbit as if it had spoken ) You don’t think so, do you? Too materialistic? ( back to Alice ) How about this? ( writes one line and then reads it aloud ) To the victor goes the spoils and the loser toils long, ( asks Alice ) OK? ( then to rabbit ) OK ( he writes furiously for two minutes or so, then holds the pad up and continues reciting unemotionally) With the empty hearted earnings, not the love to form a song You can take away my smile, never know what joy I’ve had Chain me up or dig a graveyard, whip this spirit till it’s sad But you’ll never start comparing, for my purpose far from hell Way beyond just rhyme or reason, there’s a heaven, I can tell Not one tear of mine is useless, if it only does remind Shows the way for those behind me, opens eyes of humankind While the angel you may capture, as a devil standing doomed You are lost and simply winning, from the murk will emerge gloom It will shade you, overshadow, take your garden to a wilt Cast to shit the dreams of living, Break each brick that you have built…   ( looks to Alice ) “The Poet’s Lament” ( writes this down appearing pleased ) Yeah, that’s the title I would have chosen. ( asks the Cheshire Cat ) Work for you? ( with a slight laugh ) Ah, you’re a pushover anyway! ( hops off the mushroom as he closes the pad, then speaks to the Mad Hatter ) Here, this is for you. You’re probably the only one who’d understand it anyway. ( scrounging in the snow, he finds an empty Thunderbird bottle and weighs down the pad with it atop Alice’s mushroom in front of the hatter. The Poet then wanders elfishly away with a big smile on his face, disappearing into bushes left stage. Several minutes pass. Enter Ketcham with the manila folder in hand, dressed in blue jeans, white sneakers and a light blue down ski jacket which is zippered up to her chin. Leaning against the larger mushroom with a reminiscent look in her eyes, she searches the area where she first saw The Poet. She then pulls a poem from the folder and longingly reads it aloud. )   Ketcham: ‘Lingering Shy” ( she pauses, scanning the sheet, then continues ) If I love you though regardless of the fact you here won’t stay Let meander my emotions into heaven’s path and way Felt a simple fleeting moment I had touched upon your heart Made a difference, so substantial, being someone from the start Would you blame me, try to tame me, turn as cold and walk away Never notice, find me bogus- lost my mind and gone astray And I dreaming, short of screaming, what is it that I may do Catch a hold upon sweet angel- with my soul I yearn for you In that radiance, that glowing, in your eyes and in your smile Gentle voice, a song compelling, then there’s me-in fear, a child Who is praying- night and day been, for a miracle to come You could feel my love as joyous and return to me just some.   ( putting the poem back into the folder, a tear rolls down her cheek ) How can I when you won’t let me.... ( leaning further back onto the mushroom, she knocks the bottle and pad off into the snow. She picks up the pad and opens it, flipping through the pages, then searches the area hopefully ) Oh, why me! ( frustrated, she sighs ) Why me? ( starts to walk away but stops, pats down her pockets and finds a pen. Tearing the back cover off of the folder, she scribbles a note, then places it beneath the bottle on the mushroom, casting her eyes upward ) Please, God, if you’re out there let him find this… ( she glances at Alice reflectively, then walks off slowly, searchingly, exiting right stage. The Poet immediately re-enters left stage with an apprehensive expression, and approaches the note. Lifting the note from under the bottle as if it were a delicate flower, he reads it aloud. )   The Poet: ( tenderly ) My dearest poet, I don’t know what else to call you by, but please don’t be so sad. Give me a chance to get to know you. I’ll be here tomorrow at noon, and I really need to speak with you. There’s no reason to fear me, I’m not as bad as you may think. ( holds the note to his heart beneath the blanket ) Oh, sweet Ketch, it’s not you I fear, ( casting a saddened face to the ground ) It’s me....   Scene 17   Opens on the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, the next day at noon-time. A letter sits beneath a stone atop the mushroom, along with a red rose. Overcast and foggy, most of the snow has turned to gray slush. Enter Ketcham from right stage dressed in a black raincoat and designer-ripped blue jeans tucked into knee-high black leather boots; a white scarf is covering her hair. She paces anxiously for several minutes then sees the letter and picks it up. Opening it, she reads it aloud.   Ketcham: ( reading mechanically at first, then, as she progresses, a quaver enters her voice ) My dearest Ketcham, I hope someday you may forgive me, I know I can never forgive myself and will always regret this, but do this I must. Deep down in my heart, or maybe it goes beyond that, I feel I can’t bring you the love I so want to give. It is not that you do not inspire such love in me, I just can’t seem to love myself and believe I will always be inadequate. This goes so far beyond my even trying to explain it brings tears to my eyes. Having been a literal love-sick puppy since the very first time I saw you, I followed you, dreamt of you, and consumed my every moment in thoughts of you. Yet no matter how I feel, when the nightfall comes, so does my darkness of spirit. There is no more I can say that would make sense at all except that I love you and feel I have loved you forever. I will be gone before you receive this letter and pray you will accept me as having been just another screwed-up person whom you are better off not having gotten to know. Although I will never give up hope, for then I would be as good as dead, my faith falters and my soul, it cries. Please respect this, the only thing I have ever asked of you- don’t try to find me. Love forever, Hugh. ( Ketcham cries as she folds the letter and picks up the rose shakily ) Oh Hugh, dear Hugh, I never deserved even a moment of your love. ( scene fades to black as Ketcham stands weeping )   Scene 18   Opens in the Hermitage, The Poet’s home in Burgundy, France. It is a single room, ten foot by ten foot, with stone walls. The once-polished stone floors have had their lustre replaced by the grimy buffing of centuries of wear. The ceiling is low, and crumbling white plaster hangs in patches. To the right side of the room is a fireplace with a beautiful grey marble mantelpiece. Recesses to either side support rough-cut wooden shelves filled with home grown foods, home-made stone bowls, and other primitive household items. The left side of the room has a small single mattress with one blanket on a wooden frame. Central to the back wall is a three-by-five rough opening with a grey wooden shutter that has two diamond shapes cut into it for light. Hanging above this is a walnut crucifix with a mother-of-pearl inlay and a bronze figure of Christ. Before the shutter is an old rusty card table set up as a writing desk, upon which burns a candle and a section of log is set on end next to it as a seat. The Poet is before the fireplace trying to light the kindling, but he strikes one as being frustrated in his attempts. Dressed in a dirty beige flannel shirt, he has torn jeans and his feet are bare. His hair is longer and unruly, with streaks of grey. An old ratty pair of work boots are drying atop the mantelpiece.   The Poet: ( lifting his eyes towards the heavens ) Just once I wish this damned fire would keep lit all night. What do you want me to freeze to death?! I gave up the woman of my dreams, I devoted my life to helping the needy, I’ve written countless poems in your name, and I live like a monk with barely enough food. And what do I get- bad weather, rats that are to fast for me to catch, and this a suicide fire that would rather die than burn your sacred wood. SHIT’... That’s what I get! ( throws an entire box of matches at the smouldering fire, then flops down on the log seat in bewilderment ) Forgive me, God.... ( as if magically, the kind suddenly blazes ) Oh, I get it! Be humble, grovel a little! ( picks up a pen and swings his legs under the table ) Well, what’ll it be today...? I know- “Midnight Madness”! ( starts to write as he recites out loud ) Savage calmed by soothing bell- inside his cage still all’s not well Bewitching hour growing near- he can not rage nor rant his fear Evolving on an endless tide- by night he floods, by day he’s dried Surviving, thriving, pressed apart- he splits in two He’s soul, he’s heart...   ( puts down the pen and looks up at the crucifix ) Not good enough- I know! Jesus, just once, I beg you, let me have a nightmare. I can’t take this dreaming of Ketch. Last night she was pregnant, glowing like one of yours, and you wake me from such ecstatic heaven to this cold and lonely hell. When I’m awake, it’s misery, but I could learn to live with that, if I’d only stop dreaming of what could have been! ( cranes his neck about as if to see if someone is there ) Oh, boy- I’m losing it, aren’t I? ( sighs and rests his head in his hand for a moment, then picks up the pen and continues to write, reading aloud ) When the heart becomes a monster of a love so all alone It can tear the flesh of millions, rip a mountain to the bone Make a happy man depressive, take the meaning from a life Leave the fullest of them empty with the sharpness of a knife Shoot dear God down from the heavens   ( eyes the crucifix warily, then writes on )   knock the stars out of the sky It can breed a burning hatred, teach a statue how to cry Just may twist and bend a spirit to a lost and useless soul Kill that greatest form of beauty,dig a grave- sweet laughter’s hole When a love becomes a poison, all the pain and ill that’s born could become so over bearing that I dread to wake each morn...   Scene 19   Opens on the front room of the Tarafin Restaurant in the midst of serving the midday meal. To the right is a U-shaped counter. The front portion is made of brown wood-grained formica with a chalkboard describing the day’s lunch specials above which is a stainless steel cash register. The left side of the “U” is a glass case containing samples of gourmet cheeses, meats and pastries. The right counter, set against the wall, supports a soda fountain and a coffee machine, and contains beneath it dishes, utensils and other restaurant supplies neatly sorted on white formica shelves. In the background behind the counter is a wall painted white with a pine bat-wing door leading into the kitchen. In front of the counter on the right wall is a glass entrance door. To the left are two small tables, with two chairs each, set against a half-wall separating the entrance area from a room with a dozen booths. The floor is covered with linoleum tiles in a red-and-white diagonal pattern, and the ceilings are painted white with fluorescent lighting. Ketcham is behind the counter. Her hair is cut much shorter. She is dressed in blue jeans, a white sweater with green and brown patterns about the collar and cuffs, white sneakers, and a long thick gold chain around her neck. Looking much happier then we have seen her as of yet, she is adding up a check for an older gentleman when Leslie and Richland enter. Leslie, whom seems to have aged ten years, is dressed in a purple satin two-piece suit with matching shoes, adorned heavily with jewellery, and totes a black trunk of a purse. Richland is dressed in a grey three-piece pinstripe with grey vinyl shoes and a dark green tie. Realizing who they are, Ketcham is obviously taken aback. Richland, noticing her, stares for a few seconds then nudges Leslie in the side with his elbow and nods in Ketcham’s direction.   Leslie: ( exaggerating her drawl ) Well look who it is, Little Miss Bleedin’ Heart.... ( the older gentleman exits with a puzzled expression )   Richland: ( patting Leslie’s shoulder ) Now be nice, it’s not her fault if she’s insane.   Ketcham: ( shaking her head from side to side, a smile comes back to her face ) I can see you two have improved with fame and fortune!   Leslie: ( mockingly ) Tell me, Ketcham, honey- how’s it feel to have had it all and given it away? You must love that humble pie!   Ketcham: ( sincerely ) To tell you the truth, Les, I don’t miss it in the least. I never dreamt I’d be able to help so many people in so many ways. ( she hands two menus over the counter to Richland )   Richland: ( lowers his voice ) You know, I never could figure you out. What made you do it, Ketch? You had the world in the palm of your hand.   Ketcham: ( righteously ) You really want to know?! It was people like you two and Marv, who did it. I watched you abuse people. I read about you putting people out on the street homeless, so you could build parking garages. There’s no end to the amount of evil things you have done- and all the while I knew you were nothing but trash! ( Leslie, taking the menus from Richland’s hand, tosses them over the counter onto the floor in a fit of childish pique )   Leslie: ( loses drawl somewhat ) Come on, Richland-honey. This place is too common and sleazy for the likes of us.   Richland: ( antagonistically ) Wait, before we go- tell me Ketch, was it really us, or did ( snickers under his breath ) the poet do this to you?   Ketcham: ( picking up the menus off the floor ) You know, Rich, he was more of a loving human being than a hundred of you could ever be. The only thing you have ever loved has been money.   Richland: ( with a growl ) Yeah, well, from what I hear, he’s living in a hut near where the abbey used to be, and he’s gone stark raving mad. What kind of human being locks himself away from society to live with sheep and farmers? ( Ketcham’s smile disappears )   Leslie: ( pulls Richland out the door by the belt buckle ) Let’s get out of here. This bitch is probably just as crazy!   Ketcham: ( walking around the counter, she closes the door which was left open ) Dear God, what have you done…?   Scene 20   Opens in the Hermitage, some time after midnight. A savage wind howls outside, blowing snow through the diamond shaped holes in the shutter. The fire is out and one candle is burning on the mantelpiece. Lying under a thin blanket, troubled by his dreams, The Poet shivers fiercely and kicks and pulls at his covering. A moment passes, and as his body settles down, he murmurs in his sleep.   The Poet: ( happily ) Sweet, sweet Ketch.... ( a low tortured moan is heard, then the dragging of feet. Enter The Pointless One as an apparition encircled by a violet- blue glow. His pallor is a deathly grey, and dried blood stains his chest and back. The visible portions of his flesh are in an advanced state of decomposition. Bone shows on his face and hands, and his feet are worn to the skeleton, tatters of flesh hanging at his ankles. His hair has fallen out in patches, the remainder hanging in clumps and his fingernails have become twisted claws. Waking up groggily, The Poet sees The Pointless One and sits up horrified. Panicking, he flings himself against the left wall pulling the blanket with him as if it were a shield. )   The Poet: ( shrieks hoarsly ) Oh, Lord, what be you! ( The Poet tries to push himself up the wall to a standing position, but his legs fold nervelessly beneath him as The Pointless One stops in the center of the room and appears to hover from side to side )   The Pointless One: ( in almost a whisper ) Lost to oblivion the golden of heart When none have an interest the tarnishing starts ( in total fear The Poet throws the blanket at The Pointless One who then disappears with a flash )   The Poet: ( shaking so violently he’s ready to jump out of his skin ) Oh, God, help me.... ( sliding along the back wall, he knocks over the table, grabs a lantern from the shelf and lights it as quickly as possible. He then takes a box of candles from the shelf and proceeds cautiously around the room, placing lit candles everywhere possible until the room is fully aglow. Picking up the table and setting it back in place, he then kneels down in front of the crucifix and begins to pray fervently. )   Scene 21   Opens again in the Hermitage, later the same night. Most of the candles have burnt out, and the fire, having been relit, smolders dimly. Putting out the lantern and the remaining candles, The Poet stokes the fire and crawls into his bed with the blanket wrapped tightly around himself.   The Poet: Please, please, please, tell me I was dreaming.... ( suddenly the fire flares then dies to a flicker. The Poet gives a startled cry, then a sorrowed whimper. Re-enter The Pointless One, with a flash, exactly where he was last seen. )   The Pointless One: ( louder than last we heard him ) No gleaming or glowing no light to reflect As cracks form and flourish the beauty is wrecked An ornament- useless completely unknown Not felt- it is foolish turns dust of my bones   ( The Poet sits up very slowly, his back to the wall )   With wind dissipating spreads joy far away Where no one can find it love wastes fast- won’t stay...   ( The glow around The Pointless One changes to a brilliant blue-white that increases in intensity until The Poet is totally blinded, abruptly all goes black. )   Scene 22   Opens on the main kitchen of Castle No Surrender, home of Richland Logico, in Castleiney, County Tipperary, Ireland. The kitchen is huge, and has a row of tinted bay windows along the back wall looking out into a small valley through which there is a fast running river. The sun is shining brightly just over the horizon and the sky is clear. Inside the kitchen are two white double-door freezers and two beige double-door refrigerators lining the right wall. On the left wall’s front edge are two large oak sixteen pane French doors with crystal doorknobs. Just beyond that is a beige cooker as long and as wide as a Volkswagen, and then another set of French doors. Matching oak cabinets line beneath the bay windows and antique pots and pans made of copper are set in a horizontal half moon above the windows. The floors are black and white marble, the ceiling is cathedral and covered in white plaster. Lighting is provided by two electric chandeliers balanced to either side of a black marble table in the center of the room. Around the table are six wooden chairs matching the rest of the woodwork. Richland, Leslie and Marv are sitting at the table upon which are a silver coffee pot, cups, saucers, a napkin holder, and a tray of cookies. Richland is clothed in crimson silk pajamas with a burgundy robe, Leslie, a lavender dressing gown, and Marv is wearing a dingy white T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Richland pours each of them a cup of coffee as Marv paws through the cookies looking for something he likes.   Leslie: ( pours cream into her coffee ) I still can’t get over the nerve of her. Where does she come off thinking she’s better than us!   Marv: ( drops a shortbread cookie into his cup ) Ah, just forget about her, she’s just another loser-   Richland: ( interrupts rudely ) To tell you the truth, I thought she looked better for it all. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her look so happy— that is— until Imentioned the poet. Did you see the look on her face when I said he went crazy? ( looks to Leslie ) I thought she was going to cry.   Leslie: ( sips delicately, then speaks ) I expected her to start throwing things when we were on our way out the door. She’s always been moody anyway and now that she has to ( sneeringly ) work for a living!...For her parents no less!   Marv: ( gulps down coffee, spilling some onto the front of his shirt ) I just can’t understand why people like her and the poet give it all up. Nobody cares about them, why should they care about anybody else? She had the chance of a lifetime, compliments of our dear benefactor Walter-   Leslie: ( cuts in ) The nut case!   Marv: ( continues loudly ) And she totally blew it as if money wasn’t important. Go figure. . .   Richland: ( stands and pulls a napkin from the holder on the far side of the table ) I really think that poet is the one to blame! He brainwashed Ketcham with those scribblings of his, and he mooched off Walter till the day he died!   Marv: ( dabs at his shirt with a napkin ) Well, when I spoke with George De Zorzi, he said Walter bought the abbey from the poet. I don’t think he’d need to freeload with that kind of money.   Leslie: ( emphatically ) What a hypocrite! It’s like my daddy always says- “Damned liberals will be the downfall of society!”   Marv: ( finishes his coffee and pours another ) I’ve heard him say that about Republicans and Democrats too.   Leslie: ( sticks her tongue at Marv ) Well, you know what he means.   Richland: ( refuses with a wave of his hand when Marv offers him the tray of cookies ) How is your father anyway?   Leslie: ( with irritation ) You know, the same as always, keeps complaining about never having enough money, but won’t go out and work. Jesus, he’s only seventy two, I don’t see what the big deal is. He acts like I should support him or something.   Scene 23   Opens in the Hermitage, all is dark. We can barely make out the silhouette of The Poet crouched in a corner and we hear cascading water in the distance.   The Poet:Last of the hopeless romantics ( laughs softly, a gentle madman ) I cry helplessly to the winds of time,mine having come and gone. ( pauses ) Love remains only a memoryin a world todays and tomorrows ( pauses, them continues in a slightly louder voice ) No direction left for turning,no gods to fulfill my dreams ( pauses, continues softer ) I wither-useless in the strength so long cherished and nurtured ( pauses, raises voice again ) What of the heart- saintly in intentions? Could this truly be the destiny given? ( continues but raises voice even higher ) I close my eyes ( softer ) Picturing the vivid rainbow of past joys ( pauses, continues again loud ) Not enough-faith falters at the incessant nipping of reality ( stops for two or three minutes, continues in a whisper ) The plug is pulled-I drown in the air of life...   Scene 24   Opens on the narrow wooden bridge crossing the murky green moat of Castle No Surrender. It is a sunny summer day with very few clouds in the sky. To the left is the steep stone facade of the gate keep, rising forty feet and topped by massive crenulations. On the right is a paved road leading from the bridge to woods in the distance. The metallic clicking of gears can be heard as the huge iron-bound portcullis slowly lifts open. Richland steps out, dressed in a white cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled to just below his elbows, black chinos, and brown cowboy boots. Holding a cellular phone to his right ear, he paces and waves a .44 Magnum long-barrel pistol with his left hand.   Richland: ( yells into the phone ) Fuckin’ bitch, nobody forced you to invest all your money. Idon’t owe you a dime ... You think so, huh! You come ‘roundhere and I’ll kill you ... I mean it, I’ll kill you! ( enter Leslie’s bright red 450 SL Mercedes right stage, bursting out of the woods at a high speed. Dropping the phone, Richland assumes a two-handed shooter’s stance and begins firing off rounds at the approaching vehicle. ) I warned you, slut!!! ( emptying the pistol, Richland scrabbles in his pocket for shells to reload. As she reaches the bridge, Leslie accelerates madly, careening the car off the railings erratically. Richland finishing reloading, tries to aim again, but seeing the proximity of the car, attempts to jump out of the way as Leslie steers into his motion and splatters him and the car into the wall. Accordioning, the car tips to the side and does a firey back flip into the moat. )   Scene 25   Opens on Ketcham alone in the restaurant. Dressed in a white T-shirt upon which neon orange and pink letters spell out “Pinstripe”, she has on blue jeans and white sneakers. She is sitting at a table with an unopened letter in her hands. Looking at the return address nervously, she opens it and slowly reads it aloud.   Ketcham:Dear Miss Orelse, It is with a saddened heart that I must now inform you of the deaths of your companions Mr. Richland Logico and Miss Leslie Blackwater. It would appear that upon the fall of the European Common Market this Thursday past, they decided they preferred death to poverty. Yesterday morning their bodies were discovered at Castle No Surrender by a maid returning from a weekend of liberty. Due to the nature of their deaths, no wake will be held and the internment service will be on Friday forthcoming at 11 AM in Thurles. I regret to be the bearer of such unwelcome tidings and offer to you my sincerest condolences. Cordially, George De Zorzi.( she puts down the letter with an empty expression on her face )I don’t know if you deserve it, but may God forgive you both!   Scene 26   Opens on Thurles Cemetery, County Tipperary, Ireland. It is cold, overcast and drizzling. A priest, dressed as such, stands at the head of two cheap plywood coffins reciting quickly the memorial rites in Latin. Ketcham, wearing a knee-length black dress with black spike heels and a brimless black and white hat, stands alongside Marv, who is dressed in a grey three-piece suit with black patent-leather shoes. He is swaying back and forth, obviously drunk, and barely able to hold himself up. The priest, seeing this, finishes abruptly and the coffins are lowered one by one into the ground by two workmen who have been standing off to the side. As the priest and the workmen exit stage left, Marv teeters and starts to fall into an open grave as Ketcham grabs hold of him, pulling him back to his feet.   Ketcham: ( seeming worried ) Come on, Marv. Let me bring you back to the restaurant. You look like you need a cup of coffee.( Marv stands fully erect collecting himself, and pulls a pint bottle of Irish Mist from his inner jacket pocket )   Marv : I don’t need your help! I don’t need nobody’s help. I got all I need right here. ( opens the bottle, and polishes it off, then throws the empty bottle into a grave with a crash )   Ketcham: ( tugs at his sleeve ) Don’t be a jerk, Marv. You’re drunk and I’m not going to let you drive like this! Where are you staying, I’ll take you home?   Marv: ( pushes her away, sounding like a little kid ) You’re not going to tell me you don’t know... are you?   Ketcham: ( warily ) I don’t know what, Marv?   Marv: ( coughing in violent spasms, he spits out blood) I lost everything, I spent it all! I owe more than I’ll ever get... I don’t even have a place to live anymore!   Ketcham: ( tries to latch onto Marv’s arm to keep him from falling ) It’s not important, Marv. I’ll fix you up, I can help. ( pushing away from Ketcham, Marv falls into a grave with a thud. She gives him a hand out, but he almost pulls her in while she does so. )   Marv: ( self-pityingly ) I don’t deserve your help. ( drops to his knees crying ) I’m a bastard and you’ve always known it.   Ketcham ( consolingly ) You’ve never been that, you’re just sometimes hard to take.   Marv: ( wipes his nose on his sleeve ) He was right. I never thought I’d admit it. The only person I ever loved was myself. And my friends, you see what happened to them. ( gestures towards the open graves ) They were just like me.   Ketcham: ( stands next to Marv and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder ) It’s not too late to change. I can help you find a job and a place to stay.   Marv: ( yells shrilly ) Just leave me the fuck alone!   Ketcham: ( steps back as Marv takes a feeble swing at her ) Think about it, you know where to find me when you’re ready. ( she starts to back away as Marv reaches into his vest and pulls out a gun. Seeing it, Ketcham screams desperately and lunges at him, trying to take it away ) No! ( she is too late as he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. He falls forward and twitches violently for a moment then stops. Ketcham, on her knees, pounds him on the back three times with her fist screaming ) No! No! No! NO! ( turning him on his side, she pulls him into her arms crying hysterically as the priest, the workmen and several others come running ) You fool, you poor, poor fool!   Scene 27   Opens in the Hermitage. The shutters are open revealing to us, across a valley, the lit bell tower of Flavigny framed by a star-filled spring sky. The fireplace being unlit, lighting is provided by the lantern on the table. Standing between it and the bed, The Poet is dressed the same as before, except now his shoes are on and his clothes are torn and filthy. His hair is knotted and wild-looking and he appears sickly, as if he hasn’t eaten in weeks. With a pale color, he has large blue-black bags under the eyes from sleep deprivation.   The Poet: ( ardently ) Heart of woe- I do implore,my soul release through heaven’s door Too much the pain- just can’t exist when love won’t stay- does cease, desist Takes all I have- both good and bad away from me- to drive past mad Until remains only a stain  where true should be a joyous gain Oh heart, oh heart- no longer bear this life please end if none do care.   ( The Poet punches the stone wall near the rough opening, first softly then with increasing strength until blood spatters on the wall. Kicking the bed, he goes into a wild frenzy, swiping shelves clear, knocking over the table and the lantern, and thus setting the entire front of the stage ablaze. As a curtain of flame shoots towards the ceiling, obscuring The Poet, we see the bed frame heaved above the mantelpiece, and then the crucifix falls from the wall. The scene ends in a raging fire. )   Scene 28   Opens in front of the Hermitage, it is a sunny autumn morning. In ruins, the walls are partially fallen and nothing remains of the roof but a few charred timbers. Dew covered vines have overgrown everything, and foliage obscures the valley in the background. Ketcham stands before the entrance dressed in a Navy blue trench coat, blue jeans and suede hiking boots. She appears to have aged slightly around the eyes and her hair has grayed a bit. Kicking around some of the debris, deep in thought, she notices some charcoal writing on the outside wall to the left of the doorway. Pulling the vines aside, she steps back exposing a poem to the audience.   “The Waking”   As a fire I burn- feeling unfulfilled I yearn By the masses I am spurned Oh dear God, what have I earned Was the evil overpowering that you’d send my soul away Cast my spirit down from heaven deep in hell that I must stay Are there prayers still remaining- may the good I repossess Could I beg you or implore you to your love, my life address It too late for my redemption- giving time that I may sweat Now I tell you in all honestyI truly do regret Oh dear God, please don’t forsake me-I’m in need another chance Try my best- my very hardest Leave me not to circumstance.   ( Ketcham reads the poem thoughtfully, then hesitantlypulls the vines from the right side of the doorway, exposing another poem )   “Ketch”   I won’t run if you should chase me But would meet with open arms the embrace of your affection with a love to keep you warm Not the lust of earthly body from the soul- a spirit free That will last beyond a lifetime Till the end- eternity...   Scene 29   Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, it is a sunny mild day. Enter The Poet left stage and Ketcham right stage. The Poet is dressed in an RCA Pink Puppy T-shirt, new blue jeans, new work boots, and his hair and beard are neatly trimmed. Ketcham is wearing her black oriental robe/dress, and black ballet slippers. Both move to center stage in front of Alice, staring each other lovingly in the eyes. The Poet takes Ketcham’s hands in his.   The Poet:Hold tight the thought! Ketcham:The feel? The Poet:It’s free my love! Ketcham:Not fake? The Poet: But real! Ketcham: Unlike a dream? The Poet: Has sustenance! Ketcham: Is always there? The Poet: Makes so much sense! Ketcham: Not bought? The Poet: Not sold! Both: Just made for you! Ketcham: Inside my heart! The Poet: And always true!   ( close scene as they gently embrace )   Scene 30   Opens in the front room of the Tarafin. Ketcham is dressed in brown corduroy pants, a white silk blouse, and white low-heel shoes. She is in the process of closing out the register as the last three patrons file out the door. Enter The Poet dressed in his dark blue wool dress jacket and beige Hudson Bay blazer. He has on dark brown shoes and dress jeans, and is wearing his gold- rimmed glasses.   Ketcham: ( acknowledges him with a faint smile upon her face) Hello.   The Poet: ( stretches across the counter to give her a shy kiss on the cheek ) How was it today, busy?   Ketcham ( looks back down at cash register as she counts the day’s till ) It’s always busy right before Christmas. I guess people are so busy shopping they don’t feel like cooking when they get home.   The Poet: ( leans against the counter watching Ketcham with a saddened face ) Any news from your brother in New York yet? Did they have the baby?   Ketcham: ( still counting, she speaks quickly ) No, but I think my parents are going to see him when the baby does come. I wanted to go, but someone has to mind the restaurant, and I was the last one to see him, so it’s their turn.   The Poet: ( pulls a poem from the inside pocket of his jacket ) Here’s your poem for the day. I wrote it last night after I took you home. It took me quite a long time to write you something happy and upbeat. ( he hands the poem over to Ketcham who slides it into her pocket nonchalantly )   Ketcham: ( wraps a rubber band around the bills ) Thanks, I’ll read it later. I have to close up fast, Friends are picking me up and I’m going to Dublin tonight. I’ll be spending the weekend.   The Poet: ( standing, he shuffles his feet nervously ) I’ll be leaving in a few hours for Limerick. My plane takes off tomorrow at twelve fifteen, but I have to check in around eight thirty.   Ketcham: ( places the till into a black cloth bag and puts the stack of receipts away under the counter ) Well, I guess I’ll see you sometime in March, but I have to leave the twenty first for Lourdes. I’m going there for two weeks.   The Poet: ( takes off his glasses and dabs at the corner of his left eye while Ketcham is turned ) I wish so much I wasn’t leaving, I’m going to miss you terribly!   Ketcham: ( walks around the counter, picking up a small red purse and her ski jacket from a nearby table, still holding the till bag ) I’ll keep in touch, I have your address... ( The Poet gently pulls Ketcham to him and gives her a kiss, then a hug. As he does this, he tears and wipes his eyes with the back of his hand in which he has his glasses. Ketcham seems unaware. )   The Poet: ( tries to seem positive ) I won’t be home until January third, and I won’t be any one place in France long enough for you to write me. But please don’t forget me. I love you. ( Ketcham steps away from his hug, turns off all the lights but one, and pulls her keys from inside her purse as both exit stage right )   Scene 31   Opens in the Duram Arms Pub just outside Limerick City, later the same night. The bar is partially filled with a mixed crowd of tourists and locals. Along the left wall is a red mahogany bar stretching a hundred feet or so into the background. On the right wall are three blazing fireplaces spaced by bay windows. There are several rows of booths in the center with six billiard tables in the back. The Poet sits alone in a booth near an exit with many empty glasses in front of him. Obviously intoxicated, he looks ill and unhappy, and is in the process of writing a letter which seems to give him a great deal of trouble. One of the bartenders, a man in his early forties dressed in black pants and a white shirt, walks over with a tray to clear the empty glasses.   The Poet: ( glances up from his letter ) Could I have another Irish coffee, please?   Bartender: ( speaking with a brogue, he loads glasses onto the tray ) I’m sorry, but you have drank more of those than I usually serve in a week. I have to cut you off, it’s closing time. Why don’t you go back to where you’re staying, and try to relax.   The Poet: ( standing with a struggle, he puts the pen away in his pocket ) Alright, I’m sorry if I troubled you. ( The Poet staggers towards the exit as the bartender picks up the unfinished letter and calls after him )   Bartender: ( waves the letter ) Hey, you’re forgetting this!   The Poet: ( not even looking back ) No, I’m not! ( the Poet exits and the bartender inspects the letter briefly, then recites it aloud to some of the regulars at the bar )   Bartender: ( humorously ) My love, I am not apart from you for two hours and I feel the need to obliterate my misery in alcohol; too bad it didn’t work. I cannot find it in myself to stay happy as you asked, and once again feel that nagging sensation that I will never be enough for you. It is not that I do not love you- I love you more than anything or anyone I have ever known- yet, I feel so inadequate, that I don’t want to put you through anymore of my poison. ( various patrons break out in laughter as the bartender crumples up the letter and pitches it across the room into an open fireplace ) If all that whiskey didn’t make him forget his troubles, he’s not going to.   Scene 32   Opens in an apartment in Paris, France, Christmas Eve. Rear center stage, The Poet lies on a fold-out bed covered by a brown blanket. The bed is in a living room beneath a large plate glass window through which we can see the Eiffel Tower aglow in the Parisian night. Next to the bed is a lit pedestal lamp. On the left side of the room is a student desk with a blotter, a small fluorescent light, and a chair in front of it with The Poet’s clothes draped on the back. Against the right wall is a book shelf and a stereo rack with a duffel bag propped against it. In the background can be heard the banging and moaning of two people violently making love; with each groan The Poet cringes.   The Poet: ( pleadingly ) Oh, dear Lord, why couldn’t you let me die at the Hermitage? You let me be happy for a week, and then subject me to this. ( a loud moan is heard, and The Poet cringes ) What do I have to do for her to say she loves me? Even if it had been a lie- it would have been better than this. Please give me faith. You give me hope, but it’s faith I need! I’ve never been so torn up in my life. I want to believe she loves me, but that it will just take her some time to say it, yet, I see so many signs that turn my mind and make me believe she just wanted me to go without having to hurt me face to face. Don’t let this be sympathy. I don’t want pity, I want her love! ( reaches up and shuts off the light. In the darkness can be heard the sounds of him softly crying. )   Scene 33   Opens in the Tarafin. It is late evening and Ketcham is alone at the table where she received the news of Richland’s and Leslie’s deaths. She is dressed in an orange T-shirt and blue jeans, her shoes are kicked off after a long day at work. Before her on the table are a small package and a letter. She opens the package and finds a gold-colored bracelet set with green and white stones. After examining it she puts it down and opens the letter. As she reads it silently, we can hear The Poet’s voice.   The Poet: ( fervently ) Dear Ketcham, I was sitting in Shannon Airport waiting for my plane to leave when a terrible feeling came over me. On the last night we spent together you told me I had done nothing wrong, that you were just slightly overwhelmed by all my affections and attentions. The one thing I did do majorly wrong besides briefly letting the wolf in me take control was to tell you it was all or nothing. I could not bear to be only your friend because of how strongly I feel towards you. I realize now that I would rather have your friendship then nothing at all. Having searched long hard in the Shannon Duty-Free for a friendship ring, if that is what they are called, but finding none I thought nice or which I could afford, I found this bracelet. Although it is not the real thing, I hope you will accept it as a symbol of friendship between us. I also would like to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas as I forgot to do so before my leaving. Hoping all is well. Love, Hugh.   Ketcham: ( puts down the letter and picks up the bracelet again ) Damn, how do I deal with this...?   Scene 34   Opens on The Poet as he walks around inside of the ruins of the Hermitage, with a lantern in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. Dressed in a navy blue parka and grey ski pants, his heavy black rubber boots make a flapping noise as he walks. It is night time and snowing slightly, there is four to five inches of snow on the ground already. Kicking one inside corner free of snow and debris, The Poet sits against the wall with the lantern a few feet away. Suddenly the wind picks up and although the flame to the lantern is shielded, it blows out.   The Poet: ( irritated ) Shit! No matches left. ( enter Richland and Leslie as apparitions. Dressed in scorched blood-soaked clothing, both have horribly distorted faces and are consumed in the same sickly violet glow as The Pointless One. The Poet gapes at the bottle in his hand then throws it at the figures. ) NO….   Richland: ( his image flickering briefly ) Fear us not, oh Poet, for we are the essence of the faith you need.   Leslie: ( gestures with her hand ) Look upon us and remember well.   Richland: ( places his hand over his heart ) Our lack of faith...   Leslie: Our lack of humanity…   Richland: ( balls his fists before him ) Has brought us to these ruins, for we are destined to walk forever the corridors of eternity.   Leslie: ( points at The Poet ) There is no escape- no doors to exit.   Richland: ( gestures open-handed towards The Poet ) Yet you, Poet, hold the key to heaven. Fear not the door before which you stand.   Leslie: ( speaks as both begin to fade ) Forget not your love in spirit. Though in body you may burn, your spirit shall prevail.   ( both disappear without having moved from place as the lantern relights by itself. Astonished, The Poet bolts out the doorway, leaving the lantern behind. )   Scene 35   Opens on The Poet seated at a table outside a cafe in Paris. His beige Hudson Bay blazer hangs over the back of his seat and he is dressed in blue jeans, work boots, and a Mickey Mouse T-shirt with the American Flag outlined in the shape of the United States. His hair neatly brushed, he seems to have lost his grey. In the background is the Arc de Triomphe, lit in the evening twilight. Before him sits a large heavy-set German man who is rolling up his sleeve. To the right is a table littered with empty Heineken bottles to which The Poet adds one more. The Poet sets his elbow on the table and proceeds to arm-wrestle with the German. As he does so, a crowd forms around the two cheering for the German, patting him on the back. The Poet puts down his opponent with only a slight effort and is booed by the crowd. Seeing who the victor is, a waitress comes and gives another Heineken to The Poet, which the German pays for grudgingly. Storming off, he is replaced by a younger punked-out Frenchman as The Poet finishes the beer with one good guzzle. Toying with him, The Poet wrestles this fellow with ease, laughing and cursing at him in English in the process. The waitress arrives with another beer which the loser pays for as the crowd walks away bored with watching The Poet win constantly. For a moment The Poet sits alone, and then from in the shadows appears the German with five friends. Sensing something is about to happen, The Poet attempts to stand but is stopped before he has a chance when all five of the German’s companions grab a hold of him. Two men grab each arm, pinning his hands on the table, and one holds him in a headlock as the German man who lost proceeds to smash The Poet’s hands with bottles from the table next to them. The German stabs into The Poet’s forearms with a broken bottle until he passes out in pain. They drop The Poet, leaving him slumped face first on the table which is covered with broken glass and blood, and run off just as a gendarme arrives. Quickly checking for a pulse, the gendarme calls through the doorway for an ambulance.  Scene 36   Opens in the Abbey dining room, it is night and the room is lit by the torches behind The Poet who is sitting alone in the throne-like chair. He is wearing in the same clothes he had in the cafe in Paris. Enter Ketcham, dressed as she was in the cemetery, arm-in-arm with a tall handsome Englishman. The Poet stands appalled as they approach him.   Ketcham: ( pleasantly ) Hugh, I’d like you to meet Peter my fiancé. I know this may be hard on you, but I love him and have since the first time we met. You can understand that, can’t you?   The Poet: ( desperately ) But I thought you loved me, you told me you did!   Ketcham: ( with a sardonic smile ) I never said that- but I do love you- I’m just not in love with you. Peter here ( touches Peter’s cheek lovingly ) is the one I’m in love with!   Peter: ( extending his hand to shake The Poet’s ) Sorry old fellow, to the victors go the spoils and all that! ( The Poet falls back into his chair without having shaken Peter’s hand and tears roll down his cheek as anger starts to build in his face )   The Poet: ( tight voiced ) Please Ketch, just leave, don’t put me through this.   Ketcham: ( flippantly ) Oh, Hugh, don’t be this way, you’ll find someone else. There are plenty of nice girls out there. You’ll see, you’ll forget me real soon.   The Poet: ( bordering rage ) Damn it. will you just leave! You break my heart and you expect me ( pauses confused, then yells ) Just leave!! ( Ketcham gazes at The Poet with pity in her eyes, then smiles at Peter, who smiles back. Shrugging once, they exit, leaving The Poet alone. ) Have mercy on me. ... ( putting his head down onto the table, he sobs as the lights dim. A few moments pass and The Poet becomes aware of a dripping sound on the table to his right. Turning his head without raising it, he opens his eyes to see Marv in a comparable position facing him. The dripping is blood oozing out of his head forming a puddle on the table. Dressed the same as when he died, the pink color of his skin is solely the mortician’s make-up. As he sits up, we see the neat entry hole of the bullet on his right temple, behind his left ear is the messy exit wound. )   Marv: ( cynically ) God won’t have mercy on you; he died a long time ago. ( Panicking, The Poet thrusts himself away from Marv. Tripping on his chair leg, he knocks over the chairs next to him and falls to the floor. As Marv gets up and approaches him, The Poet franticly tries to scramble away. Marv paces The Poet menacingly.) What’s-a-matter? ‘Fraid of a little blood? ( shakes his head and splatters brains and blood all over The Poet’s face and shirt ) Come on! I thought you had the stomach for these types of things. You’ve revelled in death all your life- why are you so afraid of it now?!   The Poet: ( pleadingly ) Just go away, you’re dead, I know you’re dead.   Marv: ( good-naturedly ) Oh come now, I may be dead, but I’m no worse off than you. ( he corners The Poet against the base of the bar ) You hypocrite, you preach how great love is, but look at you now... you’re a mess! Even I, the heartless monster that I am, I’m not so pitiful, am I? ( in fear, The Poet closes his eyes ) Come now, precious, you’ve prayed for death, well here I am! ( Marv laughs with insanity in his eyes )   The Poet: ( turns his head away ) I don’t want to die; I just want my misery to end. ( moving behind the bar, Marv fixes a Bloody Mary as The Poet opens his eyes to see what is happening )   Marv: ( picking up a stirrer, he swirls his drink ) Misery- hah! So that’s what you call it! The trouble with you is you don’t know when to call a spade - a spade. Misery— jeez! ( gulps drink and rubs stomach appreciatively ) You’re a tormented soul! Your body knows misery, but your real problem is your soul! ( finishes his drink then moves back to The Poet ) Tell me if I’m wrong! ( bends down so he is eye-to-eye with The Poet ) All your life you have dark and shaded dreams about a woman who gives you great love and affection, then one day, lo and behold! There she is, a thousand dreams of joy right before your very eyes. And what do you do?! Hide because you’re not good enough, you think. Fill your heart with pity and suffering, hating yourself, letting your physical body turn to shit. And they say I was a basket case! ( gives an amused laugh) Why don’t you just admit it, you weren’t meant to be happy. Here, ( picks up a steak knife from the bar ) let’s get it over with once and for all! ( pushes the knife into The Poet’s hands and places the point against his chest ) Do it! You woosie, do it!   The Poet: ( throws the knife away ) I can’t! ( cries as if he wishes he could ) I love her too much- she’d never forgive me!   Marv: ( slams his palm down onto the bar ) Never forgive you?! She doesn’t care about you!! You don’t even exist in her mind! ( walks over to pick up the knife, then goes back to The Poet, leaving a trail of maggots behind him which fall out of the back of his head ) Well then, I guess I’ll just have to do it for you. ( he lunges with the knife at The Poet who tries to dodge but fails, and catches the blade in his shoulder with a scream. The scene fades to black with him defending himself, and then explodes in light with The Poet on an emergency room table, surrounded by hospital staff and equipment, still fighting. )   Doctor: ( with a French accent ) Hold still, Monsieur. ( turns to a nurse and issues a quick succession of orders in French as several attendants grab The Poet and hold him down. Filling a syringe, a nurse gives The Poet a shot of anaesthesia, and he passes out as the doctor continues to stitch up gashes in his shoulder and arms. )                                                                     Scene 37   Opens in a thatched cottage somewhere in the middle of Ireland. Right stage, against a white-washed stone wall, is a large brass bed with a small night table next to it. Center stage is a plain wooden door. Left stage is a bureau with three unopened suitcases atop it. Overhead is a small single electric light bulb which is on. Enter Ketcham dressed in a tight fitting black dress, black heels, a pearl necklace, and The Poet’s bracelet. She is accompanied by a good-looking Irishman with blue green eyes, short brown hair, and sharp features. He is dressed in a two-piece woollen men’s suit, white shirt, red tie and black shoes. He has his arm around her as they enter, and they are laughing, joyously drunk.   Irishman: ( pulls Ketcham to him ) I’d like to thank you for a wonderful send-off for the New Year. ( he gives her a long passionate kiss while rubbing his hands up and down her spine )   Ketcham: ( stepping back, she takes both his hands ) Thank you; I had a wonderful time myself. ( the Irishman leads her to the edge of the bed, and they both sit down ) You’d better be going- it’s late and I have a lot of work to be doing tomorrow. ( the Irishman grabs her and plants another kiss on her. She pushes him away, and he falls back onto the bed with a frustrated sigh. Looking briefly at the bracelet on her wrist, she takes it off and places it on the night table then reaches over and switches off the light. )   Scene 38   Opens on a private room in a hospital in Paris. Center stage The Poet lies in a bed set in a semi-upright position, both his forearms in casts. An intravenous bottle hangs on the right, with a tube running to his arm. He is alone, and the room is dimly lit from a window to the left. A beige phone is next to him on a small light green metal table set against the bed. The phone rings and he struggles to put the receiver to his ear.   The Poet: ( half-conscious ) Hello!( dropping the phone, he picks it up again ) Walter? Walter De Zorzi! How ya been?... Well, a happy new year to you too! How did you know I was here?... Yes, it certainly has been a long time. How’s the crew at Club Mud?... And Myron how’s he?... No, I didn’t break them- someone else did. Yeah, I was too drunk to defend myself…. No- I’ll be alright, just have to use a tape recorder for a while...... I know! Well what can a crazy poet do! I’m supposed to leave the day after tomorrow, God willing. I’ll be passing through Shannon for one night.... No, I have a package to deliver to Thurles.... You guessed it— a beautiful young Irish girl. Funny thing though! She doesn’t know me from Adam, but I feel like I’ve loved her forever!... No, it’s more than just deja vu. I can’t even explain- sort of my own personal angel.... Well, devil then! So, I’m a nut job- I believe in miracles.... At the airport, sure, I’d love it if you would..... Five twenty five PM on Air Lingus flight one thirteen, JFK.... See you then, and thanks for calling. ( hangs up ) Well, stranger, here goes nothing...     Scene 39   Opens on the filled back dining room of the restaurant on Teague Road. Through the right rear window we can see it is dark outside. Anne Marie is dressed in a white blouse, dark green corduroys, and black shoes. She stands to the left foreground, alongside Marie, who is dressed as first we saw her. The background noise lowers as their conversation becomes distinguishable mid-sentence.   Marie: ( placing her hand on Anne Marie’s shoulder )… besides Anne Marie, you can do better! ( a spotlight illuminates The Poet who is in the same booth with his back to the wall. He is wearing blue jeans, work boots, and a white T-shirt with a caricature of a deranged duck freaking out and screaming “I’ve got an attitude!” Painfully trying to hold a pen, he is writing on a brown paper package. ) Look at him for instance! He looks interesting. Slightly damaged, but you need some new blood in your life.   Anne Marie: ( elbows Marie ) Cut it out!( standing, The Poet walks slowly across the room, the package pinched beneath his right arm, and his left hand concealed behind his back. The wall lights come on in the background as he approaches the two. ) Oh shit, I think he heard you!   The Poet: ( speaks to Anne Marie sheepishly ) Excuse me, miss. I, uhm, wrote you a screenplay. ( hands the package to her and steps back )One day last month you served me dinner and I haven’t been able to get you off my mind since. Please, I’d be honoured if you’d accept it. ( lets his left arm fall slightly behind his back, then, as if he just remembered, pulls out a fist full of roses and places them in Anne Marie’s free hand ) Oh... and these... it’s a custom!   Anne Marie: ( looking first at the flowers, then to Marie, she turns back to The Poet with a blush on her cheeks ) I don’t know what to say....   The Poet: ( blushes too ) Say nothing! I know this is strange, but I met you once and I’ve been in a dream ever since. Here it is, I wrote it all down.   Anne Marie: ( holds up the package ) Don’t you want this back?   The Poet: ( backs away ) No, it’s finished with now. Listen, I’ve a plane to Ketch... uh, catch. I hope you enjoy it. ( He turns and exits leaving both Anne Marie and Marie looking bewildered )   Anne Marie: ( astounded ) Who in hell was that?   Scene 40   Opens on a sunny Central Park, at the foot of the lake. In the background is the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, beneath which The Pointless One lies asleep or dead, half covered in newspapers. The Poet is dressed as we saw him in the previous scene with a red flannel shirt draped over his shoulders. With him is Walter De Zorzi, who bears a striking resemblance to the Butler, yet has a ruddy complexion as opposed to green. Dressed in a gray herringbone sport jacket, a pale yellow shirt, brown polyester pants, and brown shoes and socks, he and The Poet stand at the edge of the lake.   Walter: So how did you meet this girl, what’s her name, Anne Marie?   The Poet: To tell you the truth, Walter, I went in for dinner one day, and there she was. I didn’t even talk to her, it was my usual hit-and-run.   Walter: So the story you gave her, what was it about?   The Poet: Sort of a déjà vu-reincarnation thing, but not really. More about multiple realities.   Walter: Yours or hers? I should assume she’s in it, when you write poetry, you generally write it directed to someone.   The Poet: Not just mine or hers, it’s what she represents in this case, love. The Poet, who is the main character of the story, creates a fictitious romance which he lives out in his own peculiar reality. He’s not just one person looking for a lover; he’s everyone looking for love.   Walter: And how does she fit into this? You wrote about her, and you don’t even know her.   The Poet: It’s not her I was writing about, it’s the love that I visualized in my mind. The pains and the joys... the point being I experienced pure love. If I had known her it would have been different. Reality as the world dictates it tends to blunt the edges of what the mind and the heart can know. This six foot universe ( stretches arms out indicating a sphere around him ) in which each of us live is strictly subjective. What do you think?   Walter: Reality sucks. But you have to learn to live with it. You can express yourself or fulfil yourself in the gym, at the office, in a nightclub, or in your own imagination. As long as you’re able to satisfy what the world demands of you, you can do anything you want.   The Poet: So am I masochistic because my dreams surpass my realities and maybe prevent what could be in reality?   Walter: I think you get satisfaction from your dreams, but are unhappy because they’re not real.   The Poet: Says who?   THE END

      The Stalkers… Not everyone has met one, you usually can’t tell who they are and you never know what to expect from them. Here we go!  A few scenarios to get your minds in gear.   1/  A young driver is cut off by a snow plough and skids onto a lawn in a residential area. The house owner comes out shooting (at the car – which belongs to the young drivers parents, and at the young driver), screaming that he has had enough of his lawn being torn up. The police arrive and arrest the home owner. Two days later he is back out on the streets. He tracks down the young driver, who lives locally and is now on foot because the car is being repaired, and does a drive by shot at him as he knocks at the front door of a friend’s house. Luckily for the young driver the home owner misses (and not by much), and he is able to take cover and someone calls the police. The homeowner goes to jail a second time but the young driver doesn’t know what to expect! He packs up his things and moves out of state for awhile. A life has been changed by a stalker. The young driver wonders if he will ever be able to go home and feel safe!  2/ You’re on vacation in Ireland and you meet a nice Italian girl at a mid-evil feast in a castle near the airport. It is her last evening in Ireland and your first. You exchange addresses and for over a year write each other on a regular basis. You invite her to come visit for a week during the Christmas vacations. She is not at your house for more then an hour and you realize there is a skip in her clock. After two days, she tells you she is pregnant and it’s your child, that the Mafia wants to kill her and that she can’t go home. The pregnant part is what bothers you the most for you have never touched her and can’t wait for her to leave. You wonder what’s taking the Mafia so long! She starts saying that she won’t leave, will take an apartment or live on the streets, anything to be near her love and the father of her child. You take her to the airport and literally put her on the plane against her protestations. A week later you get a letter from her saying she is in a psycho ward in Italy and that you must come get her.  You respond that you don’t ever want to hear from her again and that she should leave your life alone. She tracks you down for years afterwards (by mail – luckily enough), always seeming a step ahead of you. You move several times but she keeps finding out where you are. Two weeks before you’re to get married to a nice French girl, the Italian sends you a letter saying she is coming to visit!?...  3/  You return to your hometown after having been travelling or living abroad for the last twenty years. Strange things start happening to you. Your brakes fail on the rental car, a blow-out of a tire while driving down a straight road in the middle of a wooded area. A fire in your house that starts for no apparent reason in the middle of the night. You start getting threatening letters, broken windows; your house is ransacked, etc., etc.. While in a local bar, an old school buddy points out Mr. X, whom you pulled out of a burning car some twenty years earlier, although not fast enough. He has been living with horrible disfiguration ever since. Mr. X gives you a knowing nod and leaves the bar just before you…  4/  You give a poem to a girl at work who knows you are a poet and has requested it. It is a love poem but not directed at her. A couple of days later your brother is stopped by a cop who tells him to pass the message on that you should stay away from his girlfriend (without saying who she is) and quit your job immediately. A few days later, your father gets 13 tickets in one shot and has to hire a lawyer to defend himself or he will lose his license and his job. You’re driving down the road and a police car slips behind you with the siren on. Over the loudspeaker you hear – “ Pull Over”…  These are just a few examples of stalkers (all of them real at least in the heart of the person being stalked). What obsesses people to this point and when does the balance tip against you? There is no easy way to prove you are being stalked, the law does not always work in your favour to protect you and your life can change so abruptly...

      What is a Muse? An inspiration drawn up from pure hope... the twisted wanderings of love... sentiments from the past pasted together to form a spirit in the present... Does a Muse give a focal point in the final scheme of life or is the Muse simply an illusion? Historically, the Muse often burnt the artist alive in his own passion, yet... who made that choice, the Muse or the Madman? Is misery really so linked to creativity? Do I have to starve, drug or deprive myself to find what lurks in my heart, and if so... wasn't it always there just waiting to come to life? Am I the proper monster of my own doing and is there a cure to this forbidden love that can't exist? My grandfather once told me that "each love is a little poison"... I wonder who may have been his Muse... things do repeat - heartbeats for example!

      What was I beforehand...a monk have many said...then how is there accounting- that god I once shot dead...a cowboy - no not horses, a girl...too much a man, an animal... the owl, the centuries I span... just maybe I was nothing... and to that I'll return, a witch right out of Salem, and on your stake I burned... Am I the thought in passing, the richness of a smile... Am I the reincarnation- of all worshipped as vile...I leave the choice to you now... be anything you want... but don't go on mistaking... I'm not the friend to taunt!
