      I have been using several main sources to learn Spanish.  First,  I have been reading the  urlLink Basics ,  urlLink Glossary , and  urlLink Vocabulary  pages at  urlLink spanishpronto.com . The best part about these is that I can pu each of these web pages on my PDA and study them on the Bus, Metro, etc. due to their well-made, straightforward layout.   I also got a grammar book and a dictionary cheap by shopping used bookstores (the dictionary) and yard sales (the grammar book).  These are my authorities in case I really need to figure out a meaning.   I also have a copy of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's  urlLink  Cien AÃ±os de Soledad  , which I would really like to read.   But the best thing I've found so far is the  urlLink Wall Street Journal's Spanish-language version of its news-in-brief .  It's short and sweet, and I can already guess at what a lot of the articles are about without having learned to speak Spanish.  I just learned that "chatarra" means "junk", as in junk bonds.  "Chatarra" means "junk."  I just used my dictionary to find out that a "chatarrero" is a scrap dealer.  Useful knowledge, don't you think?

      I have no idea how to speak Spanish, but for a number of reasons, I've decided to learn.  Follow along while I try to make it through the ins and outs of the language of Cervantes and Garcia Marquez!  I'm trying to do it without a class or any formal instruction, just a few grammar books, the Internet, and the occasional assistance of a certain female fluent in the language.  I'll try to post my work here.

       urlLink     THE SMOKING GUN? Powell's speech before the UN  According to Newsweek, the Administration will let Secretary of State use NSA intercepts of Iraqis discussing evading weapons inspectors and "hiding stuff"  (whatever that means) during his big speech to the UN next week.  I wonder if the newly hawkish Powell asked for this himself?  Or despite his supposed turnaround, is he still trying to make the diplomatic case?   urlLink The article  is at  MSNBC .  As Fred Kaplan at  Slate   has noted  , even if Powell gives his evidence, there will always be some who will not believe it, and it cannot possibly be as clear as photos of missile sites on Cuba.  This will raise the rancor and controversy as more people go from being in the middle to being either convinced or unconvinced.  You wonder if a smoking gun would change anything in France or Germany.  For example,  some Germans were just caught redhanded  helping Saddam import and build weapons of mass destruction.  This story has not shifted the antiwar stance in that country, which seems at least in part driven by Anti-Bush, Anti-Republican, or Anti-American sentiment.    Oh, and I love the Kaplan story's reference to  The Third Man , definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.

            MAKING LEGENDS OF RIO'S GANG LORDS?  I finally was able to see  urlLink City of God  Wednesday night.  The theater looked fine after last week's flood, and the movie was good.  The story lasts from the 1960s until the late 1970s or so, and despite the short time frame, this is in large part an intergenerational crime drama.  The lives of the hoods in this movie are so short and they become criminals so quickly, the gangsters of the late 1960s are gone in a couple years, the next generation only lasts a few years more, and then the next generation takes over.    At first, at the founding of the City of God, the Tender Trio (pictured above) are thug heroes, stealing gas and money and giving away a lot of the gas.  They use guns to rob a motel, but don't shoot anyone, as they're primarily robbers.  After their amateurism gets them caught by the cops, a new generation of gangsters, even younger, takes over the City of God, led by Li'l Dice (later Li'l Ze), a kid who enjoys killing and wants to rule the slum at about 18.  Li'l Ze is ruthless, but his violence has a purpose for the most part, and there are people he trusts and he seems to feel emotions besides just pain.  He is unhappy to be rejected by women, angry at his best friend Benny for leaving him, and deeply sad when the happy-go-lucky Benny is killed.  The narrator is the guy who got out of the slum, Rocket, but he seems almost a sideline to the real action, which is the tension that grows between Li'l Ze and the remaining crime/drug lord of the City of God, Carrot.  The war escalates as a former soldier Li'l Ze wrongs joins up with Carrot and instigates an all-out war.    This is dutifully shown, in dark late-night battles and daytime standoffs with whirling cameras and action that seems to have been taken from commercials.  It's clearly meant to give the audience a rush, but you feel guilty for getting excited by the action in a story that is really so sad.  It reminds me of  urlLink Boyz in the Hood  in a way, which was meant to show how bad life is in the 'Hoods of L.A., how unlikely a young black man is to get out, the violence that draws people in and kills way too many people, and the oppression of black people by the cops (sorry if that's a poor summary).  Despite the "Increase the Peace" plea, the movie was taken as glorifying the gang lifestyle.  You feel guilty here as well, wondering if this isn't making the story of bloody killers into the stuff of legend.  With its segmented storyline and "based on reality" ending, complete with interviews, the movie feels like series of legends connected together into the myth of a South American Compton.  At the end of the movie you are told that the story is based on reality and treated to a interview with one of the real-life gangsters depicted in the movie.    As the gang war winds up, you know the movie is coming to a brutal conclusion.  The ending is something of a twist, but it isn't entirely suprising.  Instead of the gang lords killing each other, the "runts," a group of street kids who care about no one but themselves and don't want to work their way up through the drug gangs, come upon Li'l Ze in a moment of weakness and gun him down.  A new generation of even more ruthless and unbelieveably young gangsters has taken over.  The runts seem barely old enough to use their guns and they're talking about killing guys with the same mixture of excitement and nonchalance American kids have about taking out the bad guys on whatever Playstation game is in style at the moment.  This is scary enough to give you goosebumps, and I think that was the intention behind this ending.  There may be a message that this problem in the slums needs to be solved, but it seems more like the movie's makers just wanted to tell the story of the gang wars of that period.  The story is exciting, but should these gang lords be made into the stuff of legend?

         AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY  Something of the scope and duration of the national-building effort in which the United States is now involved in Afghanistan can be determined by looking at the current size of the  urlLink Afghan National Army .  There are now 5 battalions in the Afghan National Army, and a total of 1,700 soldiers have graduated from basic training in Kabul.  Recruitment is difficult, dropout rates are near 40%, and local commanders (formerly known as warlords) are holding on to their private armies.  The plan is to create a force of  urlLink 70,000 soldiers by 2009 .  American soldiers are intimately involved in the training of units and  urlLink Special Forces  soldiers are assigned to each battalion.  A central corps is to be created by 2004, when Afghanistan's first real elections are to be held.  That is when the United States would like to pull out, probably so it can focus on democracy-building and creating a non-Baathist military somewhat further west, in Iraq.  All I can say about both of these situations is "good luck."

         CHUKARS UP, MICRORAPTORS DOWN  Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved dinosaurs.  So, I've been intrigued with  urlLink recently published reports  about a small dinosaur discovered by Chinese scientists to have had feathers all over its body, looking something akin to a cross between a flying squirrel, a bird, and a lizard.  The critter's fantastic appearance wasn't what most interested me, it was the schism between scientists over whether birds first began flying by running up the sides of trees or floating from their upper branches.   Only last week,  urlLink Kenneth Dial  of the  urlLink University of Montana  published  urlLink an article  published an article in  urlLink Science , based on observations of  urlLink chukar partridge  chicks, which suppported the "bottom-up" faction.  Dial had found that the chicks used their wings to run up 50-degree inclines, leading to the inference that wings are an evolutionary advantages for climbing.  But this paleontogical find, if understood properly, shows that at least some proto-avians used their wings and feathers to glide. So, what conclusions can be drawn from all the evidence?  To a layman, the recent evidence doesn't seem entirely contradictory.  Wings could have initially evolved as a way for climbing to become possible.  Running in and out of trees, those early wings could have later evolved into modern wings as proto-birds jumped out of trees and began to glide.  Eventually, we may know.  But as for now, neither side seems to have won.

         COWBOYS BEAT REDSKINS  I know that sounds bad, but trust me, it's a good thing.  My alma mater, Chimacum High School (home of the Cowboys), is the "country" half of the great town-country rivalry of East Jefferson County, Washington.  Port Townsend High School is the other half.  While Port Townsend is a small city, Chimacum sits at the end of a couple valleys-full of cows.  Chimacum has a lot less students and programs than Port Townsend.  Urbane Port Townsendites look down on Chimacum kids as hicks, and we've long resented the pretentious townies.  When I went to Chimacum, we hardly ever beat Port Townsend at anything.  So you have to celebrate Chimacum beating Port Townsend 55-45 in basketball!

         CITY OF GOD FLOODED OUT  After class today, I went to the  urlLink CO Outer Circle  theater to see  urlLink City of God  (Cidade de Deus), a  urlLink well-reviewed  Brazilian film that opened today.  However, this was an opening that didn't happen.  As I walked into the theater just as the movie was about to start, I saw people walking  out , oddly enough.  Then I looked above the concession stand.  There was water pouring from the ceiling and pooling in the theater.  The staff looked shocked and stunned, unable to do anything.  I looked on for a minute, mad that this had to happen to  me , right  now .  There's only one theater in D.C. showing this movie and another in the wilds of Bethesda, and the D.C. one is now swamped!  What will I do now? Well, try again tomorrow, of course.

       COKE PART III  Venezuela's opposition is  urlLink talking informally  with  urlLink James Carville  about how to promote their cause outside Venezuela.  Shouldn't they be talking to a Republican?  Can Carville get them inside the minds of policymakers at State or in the White House?  I doubt it.  While Carville has done some international political consulting before (for  urlLink Ehud Barak 's campaign), I don't think it is anything like this.  These Venezuelans just need effective Administration lobbying, which I'm not sure Carville can give them.

          COLIN AND CONDI  All right, so everybody knows the  urlLink Bush White House  is supposed to be good at spin control and keeping its people on-message.  So why is it that, after President Bush  urlLink came out against affirmative action  and filed  urlLink briefs  supporting the white guys in the University of  urlLink Michigan affirmative action cases ,  urlLink Condoleezza Rice  and  urlLink Colin Powell  have come out in support of affirmative action programs?   As Linda Greenhouse in the New York Times has  urlLink commented , (though  urlLink Mickey Kaus  disagrees), the Administration's legal arguments are not as strident as Bush's higher profile announcement of his anti-affirmative action position.  I think the statements of Colin and Condi are part of an Administration strategy - on the one hand, denounce affirmative action strongly, in a way that will reach American conservatives.  On the other hand, the Administration is trying to mollify those suburban housewives out there who don't want to be associated with a cryptoracist political party, so the Administration makes sure its African-American Cabinet members come out to say the Administration isn't  really  against  all forms  of affirmative action. Of course, I could be reading too much into this; real dissent is a possibility.  But I think it would be more plausible for both of them to come out within a day of each other like this in order to show the Administration isn't  that bad .  UPDATE  In an additional step to limit the harm of coming out against affirmative action, the Bush Administration made a late Sunday announcement that it would propose funding increases for Historically Black Colleges and "Hispanic-serving" universities.  All these steps make me wonder - is the Administration worried about the impact of coming out against affirmative action during the week of Martin Luther King's birthday?  UPDATE II  David Firestone of the New York Times has  urlLink looked at  Rice and Powell's positions and noticed that Rice, though she admits to having benefited from affirmative action and is not against racial diversity, opposes the University Michigan affirmative action plan.  He contrasts that with Powell, who favors the Michigan design.  I think Rice's position reflects that she is a true conservative, though her experiences as an African-American have tempered her conservatism somewhat.  Powell, however, is a Republican out of loyalty and a maverick on a number of issues, ranging from abortion to Iraq.

          PATTERN RECOGNITION AND THE CRYING OF LOT 49  I recently saw the  urlLink New York Times   urlLink review  of  urlLink William Gibson 's new book,  urlLink Pattern Recognition .  Reviewer Lisa Zeidner compared it to  urlLink Thomas Pynchon 's  urlLink The Crying of Lot 49 , which I read in December.  It seemed odd that this review would refer to the latest book I had read, and more than a little disconcerting - The Crying of Lot 49 concerned in part a vast global conspiracy.  Aside from that, the review was good and it interested me in the book.  I liked the Gibson books I've read, though that was a while ago, and this book sounds a bit like the  urlLink Bruce Sterling  near-future political science fiction I like.  I'll probably get the book soon.  Check that, the book is $26.00 without tax.  Maybe I'll just wait for paperback.

       THE 25TH HOUR   I saw Spike Lee's 25th Hour tonight at Union Station on the recommendation of my girlfriend.  I really liked two sequences in the movie.  First, the scene in the bathroom where, looking into the mirror,  urlLink Ed Norton 's character Monty Brogan has a dialogue with himself about all the things he hates about New York.  These are, of course, the things he really loves and Monty really only hates himself for having wasted his obvious potential.  The sequence starts with Monty noticing the words "fuck you" markered on the mirror in the bathroom, which reminds me of Holden finding "fuck you" written on the wall of the museum in  urlLink  "Catcher in the Rye"  , and ends with Monty frustratedly trying to rub the writing off the mirror.  Of course Monty can't, just as he can't take back all the things that led him to get 7 years of jail time.  I also liked the fantasy sequence  urlLink Brian Cox  narrates near the end.  In it, Cox, who plays Monty's father, helps Norton escape to some western desert town instead of taking him to prison.  Monty gets a job, changes his name, eventually gets his girlfriend to move out there, has a family, and when he's really old, tells his family the real story.    Other than that, the movie is interesting, but doesn't really have much of a plot.  There are good characterizations by  urlLink Philip Seymour Hoffman  and  urlLink Barry Pepper .

       COKE PART II  I've found out more information on the Venezuelan coke story.  The soldiers are also interested in bottled water and beer.  To be fair, one of the companies they seized also manufactured food.  But I'm still suspicious.

       LET THEM DRINK COKE!!!  How about  urlLink this?  Venezuelan National Guard troops armed with rifles, Uzis, and shotguns took over the bottling plant of a major local Coca-Cola bottler.  National Guard Gen. Luis Felipe Acosta Carles said that the plant was hoarding Coke, somehow trying to tie the seizure to the food shortage the country has entered due to its long prolonged political crisis.  What a joke.  While Coke has been tied to obesity, I never knew it would be something you would need to feed your people.  According to the  urlLink article , the seizure is really just another way for embattled President  urlLink Hugo Chavez  to pressure his enemies, many of whom are members of Venezuela's oligarchy.

       MOSELEY-BRAUN AND SHARPTON  I just saw an  urlLink article  saying that  urlLink Carol Moseley-Braun  is interested in running for President.  Not to be mean, but she doesn't have a chance.  I've heard it said that  urlLink Al Sharpton  (who doesn't stand a chance either)is interested in running for President in order to claim broader leadership in the black community, possibly to replace Jesse Jackson as the black leader who Democrats have to go to in order to secure the votes of this core constituency.  I have no idea if such a strategy makes sense for Sharpton.  But it must make sense to Moseley-Braun, because she seems to want part of the action.  Maybe, if her poll numbers turn out worse than his, she'd offer to be his running mate?

      Hey, so I'm back after a lengthy absence.     PRESIDENT BUSH'S MALPRACTICE DAMAGE CAP  Watching the news tonight, I saw a story about how President Bush wants to cap malpractice awards at $250,000.  Everybody's watching the insurance companies, trial lawyers, doctors, and patient advocates point fingers at each other, but nobody's surprised that President Bush would be interested in tort reform.  He's been interested in that at least since he was governor of Texas.  Maybe ever since he was rejected by the University of Texas Law School...but I digress.  What interested me about the malpractice damage cap was the timing.   Taking on Edwards   President Bush announced the cap on damages just a few weeks after Bill Frist -  urlLink "the Senate's only doctor"  - improbably succeeded Trent Lott as Majority Leader.  It's also only a few days after John Edwards announced he would run for president in 2004.  What's the one-term senator's background?  Oh, that's right, he's a rich trial lawyer, and every story about him seems to mention it.  I think President Bush sees Edwards as the prime candidate against him and is working with Frist to tar Edwards as a greedy lawyer, part of "what's wrong with America," while he's on the side of doctors and medical care for reg'lar folks.    I guess we'll just have to wait and see if my theory pans out.

         GET TO YOUR LOCAL McDONALD'S BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!   urlLink McDonald's  plans to shift to a healthier fry oil. &nbsp;Seeing as the current fry oil causes patrons' bodies to seize up due to arterial clogging, that's probably a good idea.  Not to mention growing competition from healthy [by comparison]  urlLink Subway . &nbsp;However,  urlLink McDonald's has actually put off the shift to the new fry oil indefinitely  . . . meaning it can't possibly taste as good as the current super-fatty fry oil. &nbsp;In fact, the article suggests that the change, put through under the tenure of now-departed CEO Jack Greenberg, would lead to a change in taste that could lose McDonald's some customers. &nbsp;So my suggestion to all those who enjoy a good batch of fries is to go out and get some before indignant health advocates decide to force McDonald's to follow through on its promise to disarm, er, I mean, shift to less fatty oil.  But McDonald's doesn't have to worry about my business, no matter what fry oil they use. &nbsp;As anyone who's eaten there would agree, the best fries in the world (and some of the best fried food in general) can be found at the  urlLink Ollie's Trolley  at 1426 L Street (near the corner of 15 th  & L) in Northwest D.C. &nbsp;With a host of different spices flavoring these strips of potato wonderment, Ollie's fries smell tremendous and taste even better. &nbsp;There's another Ollie's in D.C., at 425 12 th  Street, but despite the 1970s decor, that Ollie's isn't half as greasy good. &nbsp;Oh, and you can't order tabbouleh along with your cheesesteak and fries there like you can at the one at 15 th  & L.

       urlLink     MAJOR PORT TOWNSEND NEWS! DUMMY OFFICER SURVIVES POLICE CAR FIRE!  Last weekend, Port Townsend police officers set up "Officer Bob Wire" in a police cruiser to deter speeders on Discovery Road.  Monday night, a resident reported that the cruiser had been set on fire!  Though Bob survived, the car was destroyed in flames that shot nearly 30 feet into the air.  The latest word is that Bob may require reconstructive surgery.  Doughnuts, flowers, and tequila are being left on the cruiser's shell.  Though a tragedy for all dummy-kind, this is hilarious.

         CANADIAN HELICOPTER CRASH HARMS ANTI-TERROR MISSION  Did anybody in Canada realize that  urlLink  this   is all it takes for their military to be put out of commission?  A decrepit but necessary Sea-King helicopter, the only one on destroyer HMCS Iroquois, crashes on liftoff.  Because the ship has to return for damage assessment, it can't become Canada's flagship destroyer in its interdiction mission in the Persian Gulf.  So Canada's counterterrorism and anti-smuggling mission in the Gulf isn't operating at full effectiveness.  It bothers me that one helicopter crash can do this much.

         GOODBYE, NEIGHBOR  I remember as a kid not liking Mr. Rogers.  I thought he was unbearably dorky - his simple and serene life on the show was harder to fathom than the "land of make-believe" he took kids to on a miniature red trolley.  When I was older, I remember telling my Mom that I had liked Sesame Street, but never liked Mr. Rogers.  She said, no, that I actually  had  liked Mr. Rogers when I was really little - in fact, I used to call him "neighbor."  As hard for me to believe as this may be, it's probably right.  I remember that when my girlfriend saw Mr. Rogers in the Sea-Tac airport I really wished I could have seen him too.  I have a sense that Mr. Rogers, in the words of Sandburg: ... was good to look at, smelled good, listened good. He threw out something fresh and beautiful from the skin of his body and the touch of his hands wherever he passed along. That quote is from the poem that inspired this weblog,  "To A Contemporary Bunkshooter,"  and the words were used to describe Jesus.  That Mr. Rogers (an ordained Presbyterian minister) would bring to mind descriptions of Jesus just shows how a good a person he was, and how he touched so many lives in a good way.  His death is sad and merits mention. To paraphrase his song, "he...was...special."

         B.C. WANTS A LUMBER DEAL?  The two newest lumber stories I have seen deal with British Columbia.   urlLink the first article  the  Globe and Mail  has discovered that an American industry group, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports [a creature of Dewey Ballantine's John Ragosta], is complaining to the U.S. government about a "suspicious" decrease in Canadian stumpage rates.  B.C. officials say rates  have  decreased, but only based on a 15 year-old formula.  It does seem suspicious, however, that during the course of the U.S. antidumping case and ongoing the WTO dispute American imports of lumber from B.C. have actually  increased , while imports from all other provinces have decreased.  This discrepancy is hard to explain if B.C. has changed nothing about the way it handles stumpage, duties, and lumber exports over the last fifteen years.  But what do I know, I'm no expert.  In one article, B.C. Lumber Trade Council president John Allan says  urlLink now is the time for a deal , before Iraq pushes this issue onto the back burner, though  urlLink in the first article , Allan says the Coalition is only trotting out this information now to force the Canadians back to the table.  I think Ottawa doesn't need to make a deal at this precise moment and feels it can push away from the table.  On the other hand, now that the U.S. is pushing a "policy bulletin" outlining changes it wants from Canadian producers and provinces, B.C. wants a deal before it gets singled out for especially harsh treatment.

         LUMBER TALKS BREAK DOWN  Grant Aldonas, who co-teaches my class on Dispute Resolution under Trade Agreements (or something like that) wasn't in class last night.  He was negotiating with the Canadians over a lumber export tax.   urlLink According to the Globe and Mail , those talks have broken down.  After a cabinet meeting ( above ) Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew Pettigrew stated that the United States is making "excessive demands" of Canada, and the Canadians want to see what a break in the talks gets them.  Maybe they aren't as close to a deal as they seemed a couple weeks ago.  Or maybe they're so close, the parties feel no compunction about fighting over the remaining scraps on the table.  There is also the issue of how the provinces are supposed to transition away from stumpage fees.  The Commerce Department is  urlLink currently drafting  a memorandum on how it wants Canada to change - I wonder if this isn't a sticking point as well.  The Canadians want to continue with informal talks, which also makes me wonder if this isn't just a move to get the industry representatives away from the table as the governments hash out positions, so that outside lobbying doesn't cause problems.

         TIME FOR THE WMD "LOCKBOX?"  Saddam Hussein  urlLink supposedly has told  CBS's  urlLink Dan Rather  he wants to have a live televised debate with President Bush.  I can see it now.  Jim Lehrer moderating live at the United Nations with Bush on the left and Saddam at his right.  "Saddam, please allow President Bush to finish..."  Whether Rather has the story correct or not remains to be seen.  You may remember that Rather mis-called Florida for Gore on Election Night 2000.  (You may also remember that, in reflecting on this mistake, he said that, "we've lived by the crystal ball and learned to eat so much broken glass tonight that we're in critical condition.")  Well, even if Rather is reporting it correctly, President Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer has rejected debate, saying this is  urlLink "not a serious statement."   It's too bad.  [UPDATE]  Fleischer also said,  urlLink a la Mystery Science Theater 3000  that he wanted to insert himself in the middle of Rather's Saddam interview with comments from the Bush Administration.  Almost as odd as Dan Rather eating broken glass.  But cheer up, all of you who were already hoping for a knock-down drag-out live Iraq debate.  I know somebody who'd be up for the challenge!  Captain Lockbox himself,  urlLink Al Gore .  Maybe the guy who said "I will fight for you!" should take Saddam to the rhetorical mat.  "You know, Saddam, I have a  plan  for your weapons of mass destruction, your long-range Al-Samoud missiles.  I, Al Gore, promise to put them in a  "lock-box"  where no one can get them."  Sounds like a good idea to me.

         I DID NOT, NOT HAVE SEX WITH THAT CHILD . . .  Michael Jackson is one screwed up mofo.  Is he a liar?  Maybe.  If crazy people can be liars.  Some of the stuff he said seemed hard to believe.  Because of the lack of information about his life, it seemed sometimes he was just daring the interviewer, Martin Bashir, to call him a liar.  In fact, Bashir, did call him on a lot, but the contradictory facts aren't there - despite the media scrutiny, too much of Jackson's life is hidden to disprove some of his claims. What bothered me the most, of all the scenes, was that where he tried to feed his blanketed child and bounced him on his leg much too close to his crotch for my comfort.  It seemed almost like masturbation.  What a  freak .

         WHAT A COINCIDENCE!  It almost seems like Bin Laden wants the United States to invade Iraq.  He practically begged for it by  urlLink linking his cause with that of Iraq .  Is this guy crazy, stupid or both?  Maybe not so much, if you agree with the people who say Bin Laden really is seeking to foment all out war between the West and the Islamic World.  Now what about those who have said the U.S. is faking the tapes?  Isn't it just a great coincidence that this discovery turns out to bolster the weakest part of the U.S.'s case against Iraq?

         INCREASED THREAT LEVELS - CONDITION: TAUPE  I just heard that the threat level in the U.S. was increased from yellow to orange.  Living in Washington, D.C., you feel like there is always a potential terrorist threat.  If somebody was going to attack the U.S., the big targets are probably New York, D.C., and maybe some other location with high symbolic value or weak security.  So a raising of the security level only prompts you to say, "so what?"  My mind keeps going back to Darrell Hammond on Saturday Night Live as Tom Ridge - "I am immediately placing the country on condition taupe" (or whatever he said).    It's like saying "it's dangerous in D.C."  "OK," I say in response.  No,  really  dangerous.  OK, I say again.  No,  really, really  dangerous.  All right, I get the point, I say.  What does  really, really  dangerous mean as opposed to really dangerous?    Without specifics, the threat conditions are just a way for politicians to cover their asses in case something does go wrong.  Ashcroft and Ridge are thinking, what would people say if I had information about a threat that turns into a real terrorist attack, but didn't tell anyone about it?  While that is an unenviable position, unless warnings can give you information to make you change your behavior, all they cause is consternation.

         SOFTWOOD LUMBER SETTLEMENT APPEARS LIKELY  It appears from news stories out over the last week or so that U.S. and Canadian negotiators are coming close to a deal that will end the latest chapter in a twenty-plus year dispute over Canadian exports of softwood lumber.   One article  quotes Pierre Pettigrew, Canada's trade minister, quoting Grant Aldonas, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as having said Thursday that a deal could be reached within 3 weeks.  As negotiations will restart midweek, it appears Aldonas will actually be able to make an appearance at the class he team-teaches on Mondays at Georgetown Law (which I am taking).    Export Tax  It appears the answer this time is an   urlLink export tax  , which British Columbia and relevant labor unions seem to agree with and with which Ontario and Quebec are said to disagree.  The  urlLink Partnership for Growth , an advocacy group apparently mainly supported by the  urlLink Forest Products Association of Canada  has put out  urlLink TV ads  against the export tax, which I saw twice this morning on Washington DC's  urlLink NBC4 .  The ads note strong American and Canadian trade ties in other sectors, such as oil, then ask why the U.S. would impose a 27% import tax on Canadian lumber imports.  Despite this last-minute lobbying push, it is likely that the U.S. and Canada will soon agree to a settlement as the lumber dispute has cost both sides jobs when neither side can afford them.    Capitulation?  This topic hasn't really been much in the news in the U.S., mostly in the context of President Bush's  urlLink planned May 5 visit , but it's been much more of a topic for Canadian pundits, who see the settlement as a  urlLink Canadian capitulation .   That may be a reasonable conclusion, as the settlement looks like it will include not only an export tax but also a  urlLink gradual overhaul  of the way the entire Canadian lumber market works - moving away from the traditional Canadian stumpage system toward the American auction-based market.  Pettigrew made it seem that  urlLink a longer-term deal , which would include changing stumpage practices, should be conditioned on a repayment of U.S. dumping and countervailing duties to Canadian companies, but don't hold your breath.    "Gradual Overhaul"  Anyway, the "gradual overhaul" would have to be undertaken by Canada's provinces (who own most of the forests), which is probably why it's being called gradual.  In late January, British Columbia  urlLink threatened to walk out  of talks with the U.S. aimed at ending the dispute.  This was probably a direct tactical response to the push by some in Congress to subject Canadian lumber imports to a  45%  export tax (in order to pressure the Canadians into accepting the 27% export tax).  However, I believe the B.C. walkout also reflected strong distaste for this deal and there will probably anti-Ottawa resistance to changes that will put iconic Canadian lumber workers out of work, and changes in provincial law will probably be a long time coming.  The WTO Litigation  While there was litigation in the WTO, this dispute, known as Lumber IV, appears to have been settled the same way Lumber II and Lumber III were settled - with a bilateral agreement.  Lumber III involved a challenge under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement and this dispute the WTO, but  urlLink in all of these cases , the dispute ended with a duty on Canadian lumber (the Softwood Lumber Agreement also had a quota) aimed at preventing cheaper Canadian importers from gaining market share in the U.S. market.  I've only been watching this dispute for the last few years, but I wonder if the new dispute procedures didn't just make the dispute more transparent and public.  Hmmm.

       SOFTWOOD LUMBER DISPUTE  I'm from small-town Washington, a big logging state, so I've been trying to keep my eye on the  urlLink softwood lumber  dispute, which hasn't received much big-time press lately.  It seems from reading the news that  urlLink sometime this month  the U.S. and Canada may actually make a deal to settle the case, probably based on an export tax of some kind. What I wonder now is whether the  urlLink WTO litigation  was actually useful at all.

         SPACE SHUTTLE NOT IN CONTACT WITH NASA  NASA lost contact with the Space Shuttle Columbia as it neared landing at 9:00am today.  It was scheduled to land at 9:16am.   As of 9:30am , there was no word as to whether the Shuttle landed successfully or was going to come back into communication with Mission Control.  The Washington Post has a  congratulatory story about the Shuttle's successful mission , filed at 8:30am.  Hopefully there will be nothing else to report.  10:00am  CNN says  urlLink search and rescue teams have been mobilized in the Dallas area , and NASA says that if  any debris  is found, not to approach it.  Though I remain hopeful, if NASA announces that, it sounds extremely serious.   urlLink CNN  and  urlLink ABC  are now getting what appear to be citizen reports of loud or explosive noises possibly indicating a crash near the Texas/Arkansas border, and the Bush Administration is gearing up for a major conference with agencies involved in the situation.  As of 10:13am, CNN has declared that the shuttle has broken up, based on images of multiple vapor trails over Texas.     Sometime after 11:00am, NASA confirmed what has been apparent to most for the last hour or so by lowering flags to half-staff at Houston's Johnson Space Center.  How terribly, terribly sad.  2:05PM  President Bush has made the official announcement that the Shuttle broke up over Texas.  He invoked Isaiah, I believe  urlLink Isaiah 40:26 , one translation of which reads:  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these [things], that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that [he is] strong in power; not one faileth. * Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. The President continued by saying that the astronauts lost were not truly lost, as they were with God.  Religious in content, like President Reagan's speech in the Challenger context.  Overall very touching, primarily because the statement conveyed real emotion.

           THE SHREDDER  You hear a lot of stories about how bad the I.N.S. is at doing its job, but  this is just tremendous .  A 24-year old manager at the Laguna Niguel, Calif. I.N.S. data processing facility got rid of the backlog of files there by shredding up to 90,000 documents.  Needless to say, paperwork is always boring, but destroying these documents has almost certainly screwed up a vast number of people's lives.  The ironic thing for the manager is that after a stunt like that she probably won't get hired anywhere except places the poor immigrants whose documents she shredded have to work.

         US DEPT OF ENERGY REPORT ON IRAQI OIL  Dating from February 2003,  urlLink this report  details exactly why Iraqi oil is so precious.   The main reasons:  1. It's cheap. Lots of cheap labor and transportation across a flat desert road is not very expensive.  2. Easy access to worldwide distribution centers (pipelines and deep water ports)  3. There is lots of it. Second only to Saudi Arabia in proven reserves, but far less tapped then Saudi Arabia.    Iraq has been in desparate need to fix oil wells and get the infrastructure back up to standard in order to get the oil flowing without break-downs.   A few countries bid on the contracts. You might be able to guess which countries those were: France, Russia and China. And I believe that Deutsche Bank happens to be somebody who is loaning alot of money to do this. Lets see, loaning alot of money, and taking years to complete and get a return on. That means lots of interest. So apparently the only countries who were against this war, were countries that stood to make billions of dollars from contracts awarded to these countries by the Iraqi's and probably some sort of exclusivity to cheap oil. Places like China and Russia are probably not too happy about all this US led war stuff.   Here is a quote from the article:   ---------------------------------------------   As of October 2002, Iraq reportedly had signed several multi-billion dollar deals with foreign oil companies mainly from China, France, and Russia. Deutsche Bank estimates $38 billion total on new fields -- "greenfield" development -- with potential production capacity of 4.7 million bbl/d if all the deals come to fruition (which Deutsche Bank believes is highly unlikely). Iraq reportedly has become increasingly frustrated at the failure of these companies actually to begin work on the ground, and has threatened to no longer sign deals unless firms agreed to do so without delay. Iraqi upstream oil contracts generally require that companies start work immediately, but U.N. sanctions overwhelmingly have dissuaded companies from doing so. In 1992, Iraq announced plans to increase its oil production capacity to over 6.3 million bbl/d following the lifting of U.N. sanctions. This plan, which was to be accomplished in three phases over a five-year period, assumed billions of dollars worth of foreign investment. Much of the production was to come from giant fields in the south (Halfaya, Majnoon, Bin Umar, West Qurna), plus the Mishrif reservoir (Luhais, North and South Rumaila, Zubair, etc.), East Baghdad, and others.   Russia, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq for past arms deliveries, has a strong interest in Iraqi oil development. This includes a $3.7 billion, 23-year deal to rehabilitate Iraqi oilfields, particularly the 11-15 billion barrel West Qurna field (located west of Basra near the Rumaila field). West Qurna is believed to have production potential of 800,000-1 million bbl/d. In a surprising and somewhat puzzling development, in mid-December 2002 the Iraqi Oil Ministry announced that it was severing its contract with the Lukoil consortium on West Qurna due to "fail[ure] to comply" with contract stipulations. Specifically, the Iraqis cited Lukoil's failure to invest a required $200 million over three years. Two other, smaller, stakes in West Qurna by Russian companies Zarubezhneft and Mashinoimport reportedly were left intact. In addition, three exploration and production deals were signed between Iraq and Russian companies (Soyuzneftegaz, Stroytransgas-Oil, and Tatneft, to develop the 100,000-bbl/d Rafidain field, the Western Desert's Block 4, and the Western Desert's Block 9, respectively). Despite all this, Russia's Foreign Ministry said that it viewed the Iraqi decision on Lukoil and West Qurna "with regret." In mid-February 2003, following a month of talks between the two sides aimed at reversing Iraq's decision, the Iraqis announced that its decision to cancel the Lukoil deal was "finished and the contract has been scrapped."  ----------------------------------------------   Follow the money...  ---

         WHAT TO DO ABOUT KIRKUK?  Iraqi troops are being heavily bombarded in the town of Kalak and the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul.  Their apparently decreasing numbers  urlLink may indicate  that they are falling back to Mosul, which is home to urlLink  two Republican Guard divisions .  Kurdish troops,  urlLink reportedly under the command  of U.S. Special Forces, are moving into land ceded by the Iraqis near Kirkuk and clearing mines.  It seems that all sides believe the battle for Kirkuk will begin soon.    How will that go, politically?   urlLink Zalmay Khalilzad , the American envoy to the Iraqi opposition (he looks better  urlLink in sunglasses ), was in Ankara Monday to reassure the Turkish Foreign Ministry that Kurds would not, " urlLink seize the oil rich city of Kirkuk unilaterally ."  Turkey has said that would prompt an invasion by its troops waiting north of the Iraqi border.  The phrasing of that statement, "unilaterally seize" and Khalilzad's statement that the U.S. forces are in "command and control" of Kurdish militia makes it seem likely that Kirkuk will be attacked mainly by Kurdish soldiers under the command of U.S. Special Forces.  This runs counter to what I had first thought, that Turkey would not accept Kurdish soldiers entering the city at all and that U.S. forces in the area would have to take Kirkuk themselves.  It looks like a political arrangement has been made to deal with the reality on the ground.  The relatively few U.S. soldiers (maybe 3,000) in northern Iraq probably can't capture the city without significant casualties, so Kurdish Peshmerga will have to be used to make attack.  The Iraqi strategy for the defense of the Kirkuk seems to be the "Somali lesson" Iraqis are trying to apply in south-central Iraq:  urlLink draw U.S. soldiers into street battles  in urban areas.  If U.S. forces in the north can only do a little to help the attack on Baghdad, which I and a lot of other people think is the focus of the war and where its endgame will be played out, what are we doing fighting for Kirkuk or even for Mosul?  I wonder what people will think if a lot of Americans are killed fighting for a city more important to the Kurds than the U.S., who seems centered on taking Baghdad (and then maybe Tikrit).

          TERRORISTS KILLED IN NORTH IRAQ, KILLING IN SOUTH IRAQ  Based on all the information we have regarding Ansar al-Islam - you know, the recent car bombing (supposedly by a Saudi volunteer), the discovery of a  urlLink ricin production facility  (possibly related to that  urlLink found in London ), the secret Afghan Al Qaeda-style  urlLink cave/bunkers ,  urlLink the Palestinian  captured with Ansar forces, etc. etc.  - you would have thought suicide bombers would end up attacking American forces in northern Iraq.  Instead we are hearing about a suicide bombing  urlLink in southern Iraq  as part of the current Iraqi strategy of irregular warfare.  Maybe you can't connect the dots between Ansar and Saddam or Saddam and Al Qaeda, but Ansar, Al Qaeda, and Saddam obviously share one point of strategy:   fight dirty  .

           SARS MAY BE A CORONAVIRUS   Or a paramyxovirus, though scientists are moving away from that early theory.  Or a coronavirus that works in tandem with a paramyxovirus.   Or the paramyxovirus might just be something normally around this time of year unrelated to SARS.  Or a coronavirus may weaken the immune system, allowing the paramyxovirus to sicken or kill people. Scientists in labs from Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital to the U.S. Department of Defense are trying to figure out what causes SARS, a surprisingly contagious and apparently new disease that is having a strong enough effect in Eastern Asia to significantly  urlLink  harm the economy  .  Big surprise, this harms the tourism industry, but it has also forced Motorola to  urlLink idle a Singapore plant  and quarantine some workers.  People in tiny, crowded Hong Kong are trying  urlLink avoid areas with large numbers of people , which sounds pretty difficult.  If SARS turns out to be a coronavirus, it would be  urlLink one of the most powerful  members of a family better known for causing colds.  Because these viruses are generally not very harmful, there hasn't been much research as to what can counter the virus.  So even if they know what the disease is, there may not be an effective treatment.  Now this is probably starting to scare you, right?  It sure scares me.   But just to offer some perspective, check out the virus above.  That's   ebola  .  In an outbreak that I sure don't remember hearing or reading much about,  urlLink  114 of the 128 patients infected in northwestern Congo   died  of the incurable disease over the last three months.

          U.S. LOSES  ANOTHER  ANTIDUMPING DISPUTE, AG TALKS STALL  This was a few days ago, but I just read that the interim report just came out in the big U.S. - 201 Steel Safeguards dispute at the WTO.  Not surprisingly,  urlLink the U.S. lost .  The interim report isn't the final result, but interim reports basically become WTO panel reports.  The U.S. always seems to lose these cases.  I can't read why because only the interim report is out and the report is supposedly only in the hands of the relevant governments and those who need to know, though the result has been widely circulated in the news.  The U.S. will wait for the panel report to come out and it has already  urlLink promised to appeal .  This could go on for quite a while.  I'd bet, however, that the steel safeguards will last long enough for President Bush to benefit for sticking up for the steelworkers of the industrial midwest (and the rest of the U.S.) whose votes he hopes to get.  Steel.  There aren't that many steelworkers any more, just as there aren't that many farmers.  But in certain iconic sectors like this, politicians feel they have to win votes, so  urlLink they don't let these sectors become liberalized .  I think it's because people in areas like the midwest  identify  themselves as having common cause with steelworkers just as those in historically more rural, less California or Northeastern states identify themselves with farmers.  Saving the job of the farmer or steelworker means more than just the vote of one family, it means the support of an entire region.  This isn't true only of the U.S., other countries feel pride in having a steel sector - it's the heart of an old-school industrial base.  This kind of nostalgic chauvinism has serious consequences for the international trading system.  The U.S.'s string of WTO losses angers many at home and harms the image of free trade, even if most would call the U.S. measures in dispute protectionist.  As movement on agricultural subsidies has been tied to larger trade liberalization by many in the Doha Round, many wonder if the Round is going to fail so the U.S., EU, Japan (and others) can subsidize their few remaining farmers.  You hope that wouldn't be the case, but it appears the iconic sectors the U.S. and others want to protect are iconic trade restrictions for those in the rest of the world.

         ATTACK ON ANSAR BEGINS  Kurdish troops and American Special Forces  urlLink launched the major attack  on Ansar al-Islam everyone had been waiting for at dawn today.  Nearly 5,000 Kurdish troops had been mobilized to make the attack on the group, estimated to have several hundred fighters.  They attacked from several directions while American special forces directed mortar fire from snowy hilltops and called in air strikes from circling planes.  Within several hours they had captured the Kurdish base at Biara as well as the towns of  urlLink Khurmal, Sargat, Ahmadabad and the other villages in the region .  The few remaining fighters made a run for the Iranian border and a local commander said the area should be mopped up within 24 hours.  Information regarding the attack supposedly came from  urlLink reporters embedded with the 1,000 Americans  who recently parachuted into Iraq, so it seems those forces were involved as well.  The U.S. and the Kurds attacked Ansar to be rid of a terrorist irritant and because of alleged ties to Al Qaeda.  Those ties seemed more reasonable after the suicide bomber in last week's car bomb attack that killed a photographer was revealed to be a Saudi,  urlLink Abdal Aziz bin Saud al Gharbi .  This seems to indicate that the organization wasn't strictly a homegrown group of  urlLink Iraqi Kurds who had fought in Afghanistan with the Taliban or Al Qaeda , there was at least some  international  component to Ansar al-Islam.   UPDATE:  See the New York Times' story for urlLink  more details .

         KURDS ADVANCE TO WITHIN 20KM OF KIRKUK  After Iraqi soldiers retreated from their positions near Chamchamal yesterday, Kurdish Peshmerga  urlLink advanced to capture the checkpoint of Bani Maqan  outside Kirkuk.  In a counterattack,  urlLink Iraqis have shelled Chamchamal , according to resident bomb-spotter, Reuters' Mike Collett-White.  The big question now is whether the Kurds will avoid the temptation of trying to take Kirkuk, what with the deals the Kurdish leaders made with Turkey (and probably the United States) to not capture the town.  Mam Rostam, the local Peshmerga commander, has attempted to reassure everyone that urlLink  the advance hasn't gone beyond the limits  set in those deals.  While  urlLink the advance  to Bani Maqan was made not only by soldiers but by some (looting) civilians as well,  urlLink many people are staying out of the no-man's land  until things settle down.

         WHERE IS NATE THAYER?  Nate Thayer, a  urlLink Slate contributor  and freelance journalist, has not posted anything on  urlLink Slate  for several days after a story in which he indicated that he was due to be expelled and was trying to avoid that fate because he would be forced to take the western road from Baghdad to Syria.  Most people commenting on the situation have come to the same inference from these facts: Nate Thayer is missing.  In response to that article, I posted this in Slate's  urlLink  Fray   regarding this subject and am re-posting it here, in edited form.  If you want to know where Nate Thayer is, as I do, publicize his cause.  It may convince someone to try to find him.  If you have any information, post it on Slate's  urlLink  Fray   or here urlLink  .   Here's what I think I heard about Nate Thayer:  On Monday I saw  urlLink Charlie Rose  where he had on as his guest  urlLink Jon Lee Anderson  of  urlLink The New Yorker . If I remember correctly, Anderson said that few people feel safe making the crossing from the Jordan and Syria to Baghdad or vice versa. A couple Turkish journalists had apparently made it through but were absolutely terrorized by freebooters out on the highway. The road is littered by charred vehicles and burned-out buildings and people fear American bombing and fighting in the area. Professional drivers who have traveled to Baghdad for years  urlLink are afraid to take the road to Baghdad . A bus load of Syrians were hit on a bridge by an American plane, killing  urlLink a number of riders . There are  urlLink few people in refugee camps   in Jordan because of the danger of the trip from Baghdad. Basically, roads west from Baghdad are really dangerous.  Anderson also made reference to a young journalist who had been ordered out of the country and whose girlfriend, who was apparently still in Baghdad, had heard no word of him. I hope that he isn't referring to Nate Thayer, or alternatively that Nate's girlfriend soon gets word he is OK.  urlLink sirach  suggested that we all pray for Nate.  Here is my offering, from the back of a holy card depicting St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers (can you guess I'm Catholic?):   The Motorist's Prayer:  Grant me, O Lord, a steady hand and watchful eye, that no one shall be hurt as I pass by. Thou gavest life, I pray no act of mine may take away or mar that gift of Thine. Shelter those, dear Lord, who bear my company from the evils of fire and all calamity. Teach me to use my car for others need; Nor miss through love of undue speed. The beauty of the world; that thus I may with joy and courtesy go on my way. St. Christopher, holy patron of travelers, protect me, and lead me safely to my destiny.   Good luck, Nate. I hope you weren't kicked out or that if you were, you make it safely on the road to Syria.   UPDATE: NATE LIVES! Nate Thayer just  urlLink posted on Slate  regarding his ordeal.  He took the road to Jordan with another kicked-out journalist and made it out alive.

         NORTHERN FRONT OPENS, TROOP DEMANDS IN SOUTHERN IRAQ LIMIT EXPANSION  Now that troops are flying into Harir airfield near Bashur on the northern front of the war, the question is "when will they start attacking Iraqis?"  I think the answer to that came today with the information that  urlLink 30,000 more American soldiers  are being rushed to  southern  Iraq to deal with the problems of long supply lines and stiffer-than-expected resistance on the way to Baghdad.  There are unconfirmed reports of requests for  urlLink 4,000 more British troops   to fight in the south as well.  To me that indicates that there won't be any dramatic increase in the number of troops that come in to northern Iraq.  So, the first mission will be to deal with Ansar and secure the base the Americans are establishing.  The Ansar operation is probably entirely compartmentalized; Special Forces soldiers will probably fight there alongside Kurdish Peshmerga.  The Army troops flying in probably won't be involved; they're probably going to simply try to ensure stability in the area and try to deal with the local situation.  Later, once American troops at Harir are able to secure enough materiel, they will begin to attack Iraqi positions considered vulnerable to a relatively small American force working with the Kurds. That will probably mean positions near, say, Chamchamal or Kalak, which  urlLink continue to be bombed .   urlLink ABC News  is even reporting that Iraqi units at Chamchamal  urlLink are retreating though not under attack .  Reuters'  urlLink Mike Collett-White  (who seems to be a great spotter for troop movements and American bombings in northern Iraq) said  urlLink Kurdish forces have moved 4km into Iraqi territory  near Chamchamal.  Whether other Iraqis in Kurdish areas will be pushovers remains to be seen.  Then, once the units are at full strength, American forces will try to take Kirkuk without much Kurdish involvement.  How this will be done is tricky, as the Kurds would ideally want Kirkuk as the capital of whatever form of Kurdistan emerges from this war, it sits on an oil field and it was once the home of a great many Kurds  urlLink who were forced out .  Turkey doesn't want Kirkuk in Kurdish control and the U.S. is in the difficult position of trying to restrain its Kurdish allies for their own good.  Mosul, with a larger Arab population, will probably be next for the Americans.  What will happen next is unclear; the fighting for Baghdad will probably be concurrent with these operations and more troops and planes may not be spared for fighting in the north.  But if the battle for Baghdad hasn't bogged coalition forces down, they will probably move on Tikrit.  Tikrit will probably require a significant ramp-up in the numbers of troops Americans have in the north; as Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said today, Republican Guard  urlLink troops are making a defensive ring around the town  like that around Baghdad.  Hopefully the U.S. will have enough troops to take out Tikrit soon, or the battle for Baghdad and the battle for Tikrit will have to be fought almost simultaneously.

         PARATROOPERS LAND TO OPEN NORTHERN FRONT  According to Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force, nearly 1,000 Army paratroopers  urlLink    from the 173rd Airborne Brigade jumped from 15 Air Force C-17 transports at midnight Thursday to take control of a runway near  Bashur  in Kurdish-held northern Iraq.  The troops, based in Vicenza, Italy flew directly from Aviano Air Base to open a new front in the war in Iraq.  They are in a prime location to influence events in both PUK- and KDP-held areas and the Turks waiting  urlLink just 30 miles to the north .  The troops, which include Army Rangers, landed in this fashion so that they could mass to protect themselves,  urlLink though they did not meet with hostile fire .  They were also protected by air cover from AC-130 gun ships.  The lightly armed force will be reinforced and receive heavier weapons,  urlLink including Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles   urlLink over the next several days  .    Commanders said that Special Forces soldiers being flown into the airport had to turn around last week because they  urlLink were being fired upon  and other Special Forces soldiers  urlLink had come under attack  in Irbil, about 35 miles away.  They are also supposedly  urlLink worried about Ansar al-Islam .  I  may have actually been right  in my last post!.  The U.S. is worried about protecting its troops in northern Iraq and probably attacked Ansar as a prelude to opening up large-scale operations on the northern front.  That is why  urlLink Kurdish officials have offered amnesties to the less hardcore members of that group and have arranged to have members of Komala, a similar but less dangerous group, leave their villages .  I amaze even myself sometimes.

         WHY TAKE ON ANSAR FIRST? TO PROTECT AMERICAN TROOPS  U.S. warplanes continued bombing attacks in Northern Iraq today.   Iraqi positions near  urlLink Chamchamal, Kalak, Kirkuk and Mosul  were bombed, but local Peshmerga commander Mam Rostam said the bombing  urlLink needed to be much heavier  to bring the war to a swift end.  The U.S. certainly seems able to do more to help fight the Kurds the Iraqis, based on the  urlLink 100 or so missiles   and numerous bombs it has been able to drop in the few valleys the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Islam controls.  However, instead of fighting Iraqis, the U.S. appears to have decided to take out Ansar al-Islam.  This has puzzled some observers who consider Ansar a gadfly rather than a real target.  I think I may know why the U.S. has decided to destroy Ansar before truly opening a northern front.  I think the reason why the U.S. is trying to take on Ansar first is that the U.S. wants to significantly increase the number of coalition troops it can place in Northern Iraq.  Americans care about how their soldiers die, as has been evidenced by the rough division of labor between British and American forces in southern Iraq.  The U.S. advances toward Baghdad while the British taken on much of the urban warfare the Americans have been loath to engage in since Mogadishu.  Just as the U.S. public does not want to see its troops dragged through the streets of far-off cities, the U.S. public does not want its troops to fall victim to preventable terror attacks.  And U.S. war planners probably have determined that American soldiers face a significant risk of terror attacks if large numbers of troops move into Northern Iraq before Ansar al-Islam is eradicated.  This is not an entirely unreasonable fear as Ansar is considered responsible for a urlLink  car bomb attack that killed an Australian journalist  last weekend.  I believe the U.S. wants to place more troops in northern Iraq for several reasons.  First, the Kurds are not the Northern Alliance.  They are more concerned with their own welfare than liberating Iraq.  They will probably not want to fight outside of Kurdish areas and would likely be seen as intruders rather than liberators by the Iraqi Arabs to their south.  A few hundred Special Forces troops and the Peshmerga probably couldn't take on  urlLink the Iraqi division near Kirkuk  or the forces Saddam has arrayed north of Baghdad.  Taking control over the Arab areas north of Baghdad before the battle for that city is an important coalition goal.  That area includes Tikrit, the base of Saddam's power and his home base.  There are probably illegal weapons stashed there and the U.S. wants to find them to show the world that war was justified.  Tommy Franks also of course wants to prevent any escape to that region by Saddam or any of those who stand to lose from regime change after it become obvious that Baghdad is going to be taken by coalition forces.   urlLink Capturing or killing Saddam  is a major goal of this war.  Though regime change could take place if he just disappears, that will be one more bad guy the Americans couldn't catch: the U.S. doesn't have  urlLink Mullah Omar  or  urlLink Usama Bin Laden .  In addition, if significant numbers of U.S. forces are in the region, the U.S. will be able to capture the major northern cities like Kirkuk.  This will allow us to avoid inflaming Turkish passions regarding Kurdish independence.  It will also help prevent Kurds from taking revenge on the Arabs in those cities who have mistreated them and confiscated their land and property.

         BUDGET CHICANERY  Switching back to the home front for a moment, in Washington, the President presented Congress with a  urlLink supplemental request for $74.7 billion  to support the war effort in Iraq.  But  urlLink only last week  the President asked Congress to vote on a budget  urlLink which included large tax cuts , while denying that estimates of war costs could be made so these costs could be offset.  President Bush isn't lying, it is hard to estimate war costs.  But he could have waited to have a vote on the budget until war costs were clearer - say, another week?  If Congress had to balance tax cuts and war spending at the same time, tax cuts would likely lose - or at least have to be scaled back.  By bringing up the two issues at different times, the Bush Administration is setting foreign policy goals and asking for spending necessary to meet those goals, then not forcing Congress and the public to consider how to pay for it.   As much as I think we should promote American interests abroad, it is wrong to tell someone to go spend money you know they will have to give you back next week.  Go ahead, blame Democrats for overtaxing and overspending on domestic priorities.  But don't pretend forcing Congress to decide on big tax cuts when war-related costs are just over the horizon is any better.

         THE ANSWER TO ANSAR AL-ISLAM?  Amid all the Byzantine dealmaking over what will happen to Kurdish northern Iraq,  urlLink American bombing of Kirkuk, Mosul, Chamchamal and other areas  is continuing and  urlLink people are leaving these towns .  Increasing numbers of U.S. forces are being moved there to open a second front.  Interestingly, U.S. Marine Col. Keith Lawless, speaking in the Kurdish city of Salahuddin, said that it should not be presumed that these troops are being flown in, though senior PUK officials said that 300 Special Forces soldiers were flown to Suleymaniah on four transports, increasing the American presence in the area to approximately 500.  An American commander,  urlLink Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Henry "Pete" Osman, has also arrived in northern Iraq .  Some Special Forces troops  urlLink are working with the Kurds to attack Iraqi positions  near Chamchamal and Kirkuk.  Other  urlLink  lightly armed U.S. soldiers are headed for Halabja , the front-line city in the Kurdish fight against Ansar al-Islam, the group some say was responsible for a car bomb attack over the weekend (Komala, a smaller Islamist group, may have also been responsible).  U.S. special forces and Kurdish peshmerga troops are  urlLink preparing for a major ground assault   against Ansar.   urlLink Tomahawk missiles have rained down  on Ansar villages in the mountainous border region, which may contain 1,000-3,000 Kurdish and Arab fighters. The first target for attacks will be  urlLink Khurmal , a town with its own small Islamist group, which commands a strategic road leading into the mountains.  When the fighting will start is still unclear.

            AMERICANS ADVANCE IN SOUTH, BRITS FIGHT URBAN BATTLES  Though there was bloody fighting yesterday, U.S. strategy in southern Iraq seems to be working as could be expected.   urlLink U.S. and British forces are advancing as fast as possible on Baghdad , fighting where they have to ( e.g.   urlLink An Nasiriya  and  urlLink Najaf ) and leapfrogging cities where they could be forced into difficult urban warfare ( e.g.  Basra).  They are leaving, therefore, areas behind them that do not require simply mopping-up actions in the normal sense.   urlLink Umm Qasr  is a good example; it was thought pacified until resistance showed up, and serious fighting resumed.  British troops are  urlLink slowly moving into Basra , where Iraqis have dug in in civilian areas.  It seems that the British have been conducting a lot of the urban warfare as the Americans move north.  I wonder if this is rooted in the legendary impatience and fickleness of the American public.  If Americans watching the news don't want to see American troops in difficult, bloody, house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting, giving that job to the British (with their experience in Northern Ireland) does seem to solve a problem for American war planners.  They don't want the TV war to look like the Mogadishu of  urlLink Blackhawk Down .  This makes me wonder if the British public are any less averse to such images.

         IRAQI VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF WAR?  In a briefing at CENTCOM today, Lt. Gen. John Abizaid said that Iraqis are violating the Geneva Convention.  Here's what the Iraqis are alleged to have done:  Iraqi forces are alleged to have  urlLink acted as if they were surrendering then to have opened fire with artillery on American soldiers  coming to accept their surrender.  This was said to have resulted in the deaths of approximately fifteen American soldiers.   Several soldiers supposedly made a wrong turn and were captured by Iraqi forces.  The Iraqis apparently videotaped these soldiers identifying themselves and their home states.  These images and then those of several bodies were then  urlLink shown on Iraqi state television  (the pictures above are supposedly from this videotape).  So the Iraqis humiliated, videotaped, and executed soldiers contrary to the Geneva Convention's Article 13.   American forces were also attacked by Iraqi forces out of uniform infiltrating into southern Iraq, supposedly  urlLink Saddam's Fedayeen  and Special Security Organization troops, who apparently welcomed Americans and then ambushed them.   And now there are indications that  urlLink twelve American soldiers have been captured by Iraqi irregulars .  President Bush has said that he  urlLink expects them to be treated humanely , but based on the way these others were treated, that unfortunately seems unlikely.  Iraq's Defense Minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed has said that  urlLink Iraq would not harm prisoners of war and would treat them in accordance with the Geneva Convention , but as the  urlLink Iraqi regime is starting to lose control , especially in the South, American soldiers are likely to be mistreated or killed if captured.

            WILL THE U.S. LET TURKS TAKE NORTHERN IRAQ?  Turkish military sources say that  urlLink 1,000-1,500 Turkish commandos have entered Iraqi Kurdistan  via the city of Cucurka, at the borders of Iraq, Turkey, and Iran as a precursor to a larger force waiting on the other side of the Turkish border.  While these forces are supposedly entering Iraq for humanitarian purposes, Turkish concerns about the de facto independence of Kurdish areas indicate that isn't Turkey's sole motivation.  That and the fact that   commandos   are entering first.  If you think the U.S. is screwing up diplomatically, Turkey (you know, the home of the bazaar and hard-bargaining rug dealers?) isn't doing much better.  Turkey missed out on a very lucrative deal on overflight rights; angered U.S. officials by not allowing the U.S. to give air support to Special Forces soldiers in Iraq either from or over Turkish airspace; and are now trying to get into northern Iraq either to occupy Kurdish areas or attack Turkish enemies without the U.S.'s blessing.  Somewhere in the OEOB, White House, or Pentagon American staffers are taking more than the recommended dose of Excedrin.  The U.S. has said that it is against a large unilateral incursion, but what will the U.S. do to enforce its desire to keep the Turks out?   My bet:  The U.S. will push Turkey strongly, using whatever leverage it has, not to start an invasion while downplaying the current incursion.  The U.S. will say publicly that Turkish forces often enter Iraq in these kind of numbers.   My big question:  Will U.S. forces take a military stand against Turkish forces if they go too far, for instance, if they try to take Kirkuk?   UPDATE:  CENTCOM Commander General Tommy Franks, in a televised press conference, said that Turkish forces in Iraq are light formations, moving in and out of Turkey, and that political discussions are continuing above Franks' "pay grade."  Franks also said that he has liaison officers with Turkish forces - I don't know if this is in Istanbul, Diyarbakir, Cucurka, or with Turkish forces in Iraq.   UPDATE II:  In a statement, Turkey's military  urlLink denied that its troops had been sent into Iraq  and  urlLink Turkey's ambassador to the U.S. repeated this to CNN .  Turkish military officials closer to Iraq, however, said Turkish forces   had   entered that country.  A senior Iraqi Kurdish official, Hoshyar Zebari, told reporters that no new Turkish troops were in the area, but this contradicts  urlLink specific press and other reports   of entry by Turkish forces.  So something is going on.  I wonder if this is an instance of local Turkish commanders doing things headquarters don't know about.  Turkey also said that it is ready to enter Iraq for humanitarian reasons (keep refugees out of Turkey) and prevent "terrorist activity" (one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist) but that its 3 urlLink  ,000 or so forces already in the country would stay within a 20km buffer zone unless its national interests were threatened.   U.S. MILITARY MOVES IN NORTHERN IRAQ  The U.S. is also moving to take military action itself in Northern Iraq.  Americans  urlLink have launched airstrikes against Ansar al-Islam , an Al Qaeda-linked Taliban-like group holding a tiny enclave in Kurdistan.   urlLink U.S. planes are bombing Kirkuk and Mosul  and  urlLink Special Forces are trying to close southern roads and capture these cities .  After negotiations with Turkey over troops and overflights soured, as many as 200  urlLink Special Forces soldiers were sent to eastern Jordan to set up airfields  from which airborne troops could be flown into northern Iraq.  If these stories are correct, the U.S. may be able to take Kirkuk, which would hopefully prevent a battle between Kurdish and Turkish forces for the city.

         BUSH'S "COALITION" TOPS 40 COUNTRIES  Take a look at the  urlLink growing list of backers  behind  Gulf War II: This Time We're Serious .  Everybody knows the U.S.'s war against Iraq was primarily a unilateral choice.  While efforts were made to bring in other allies, President Bush has only one major supporter in this war: Tony Blair.  The British public dislike the war, as do the publics of a number of other states supporting the U.S. but less able to contribute much to the war.  The support of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Australia seems premised on the fact that these countries all have like-minded Conservative governments, not any listening to public opinion.  As many have said, Eastern European support is based on the liberation of those countries which can at least in part be attributed to the United States' Cold War stance.  While some allies have offered support, Only Britain and Australia have offered combat troops.  Though some of the other countries on the list are strategic and important, most are names on a list rather than anybody worth signing up for this fight.  Eritrea: strategically important.  Marshall Islands: not so much.  Why don't we just look at the list:   Afghanistan  Why would Afghanistan  not  sign up?  Its new government was installed by the U.S. and requires U.S. support. Afghanistan is also important for the war on terror.  Angola  Though not geo-strategic, Angola is currently a member of the UN Security Council.  Albania  Muslim population.  U.S. saved Albanians from Serbs in Kosovo.  I have no idea what they can contribute besides one more Muslim country on the U.S.'s tally sheet.  Australia  Strong support, including Special Forces troops.  Pretty good for a country with a smaller population than New York state.  Azerbaijan  Another Muslim country.  It's interesting that they're on the U.S. team now, not longtime enemy Armenia (which from what I've heard looks to Russia for all the answers).  Armenians seemed to have the upper hand in the U.S. for a long time.  I wonder if that will change at all now.  What can they contribute?  Little or nothing as far as I know.  Bulgaria  Eastern Europe, that debt-to-the-United-States-for-sticking out-the-Cold-War thing.  Colombia  Colombia wants the U.S. to remember it when this war is done.  The Colombians are trying to fight a war on terror much different from that in the Middle East, but need American help, especially because President Uribe wants to escalate the war in an attempt to finally kill the FARC and ELN.  Czech Republic  Eastern Europe, liberation, debt to U.S., yadi yadi yadda.  I think they have some chemical weapons experts.  Denmark  Peripheral EU country.  Some of these support the U.S. in the war.  Maybe it's just sticking with NATO, maybe its sticking it to the big naysayers, the central EU countries, Germany and France.  A representative from Danish forces was on the podium with Tommy Franks in a CENTCOM briefing on Saturday  Dominican Republic  Ummm, yeah.  Trying to get in good with the U.S., with whom they fight drugs and to whom they export immigrants and baseball players.  El Salvador  I have no clue what El Salvador has to offer.  Eritrea  Strategic ports in the Middle East, especially as an alternative to tribal, hostile Yemen.  Estonia  Eastern Europe.  Same as the other Eastern Europeans.  Ethiopia  Somewhat Middle Eastern.  May be useful, how I'm not sure.  Georgia  Relevant to war on terror, not so relevant to fighting Iraq.  Honduras  Same as El Salvador.  Nothing to offer.  Hungary  Eastern European reasons for support apply.  Iceland  NATO, between Britain and the U.S.  Not sure what they can offer in a war on a decidedly non-icy place.  Perhaps attractive women for the troops?  Italy  Important country, good to have along, but Berlusconi seems to be going in a very different direction than his populace, with is Anti-Bush and Anti-War.  Japan  Important to have along, though I doubt they'll be as willing to act as the international ATM like they did after  Gulf War I: Let's Leave Saddam in Power .  Kuwait  Well, duh.  You exist because of the U.S.  Latvia  Eastern Europe.  Lithuania  Eastern Europe.  Macedonia  Eastern Europe.  But I'm a bit surprised, many Macedonians aren't fans of the Albanians the Americans saved in Kosovo who came to screw up their country.  Marshall Islands  Good vacation spot after the war is over  Micronesia  Ditto, good vacation spot.  Maybe if Diego Garcia or Guantanamo get full of terrorists we can put them on  these  islands.  Mongolia  I guess they must like the U.S., I really have no clue.  All I know is that one of the diplomats who resigned angry at U.S. Iraq policy was stationed here.  Apparently the locals were less angry about American policy than those in the U.S. Foreign Service.  Netherlands  I'm not sure what they're contributing, but a representative from Dutch forces was on the podium with Tommy Franks in a CENTCOM briefing on Saturday.  Nicaragua  I have no clue what Nicaragua has to offer.  Philippines  Good ally for war on terror, maybe they just signed up for this to keep American goodwill for the terror fight.  Poland  Strong American ally in Eastern Europe, has some noncombat troops in theater.  Portugal  Supportive, had Azores summit, but little to contribute in way of forces.  Romania  Eastern Europe.  Same justifications, plus "we want to be in NATO!"  Rwanda  I don't get this.  The U.S. didn't save us back when we butchered each other, now it's taking out Saddam because it seems the right thing to do.  Maybe Rwanda's government needs Western support to hold off civil war.  Maybe they want the U.S. to help in case they have problems again.  Singapore  Maybe Singapore is expressing solidarity with the U.S. war on terrorism by saying it supports the U.S. in this.  Singapore has been fighting terrorism with the U.S.  Slovakia  Eastern Europe.  Solomon Islands  Middle of nowhere, just looking for the U.S. to be its friend, probably.  South Korea  Maybe South Korea is trying to make nice with the U.S. so that the U.S. will discuss North Korea policy and not act rashly regarding Kim Jong Il after Iraq is done and that becomes the last remaining axis of evil the U.S. will deal with militarily.  Spain    Ally, but no troops for the fighting.  Turkey  What a bad ally.  Overflight rights, that's it.  And in tacit exchange they want the right to occupy Kurdistan in Northern Iraq, possibly more than temporarily.  The U.S. should never let that tacit deal be made.  Uganda  I am clueless.  United Kingdom  THE ALLY.  Now if its people would just go along.  United States  The U.S. is tallying itself in its coalition?  How lame.  Uzbekistan  Part of the war on terror, new U.S. "ally" in Central Asia.  And let's not forget the "secret supporters," ahem, (Saudi Arabia, Jordan) who can't give that much because of their public's hatred of this war.

         FIRST AMERICAN COMBAT DEATH  Americans are taking over oil fields in Southern Iraq and air fields in Western Iraq right now.  An American Marine  was killed by Iraqis in the advance on the Rumeila oil field .  There have been previous deaths; all twelve U.S. and British soldiers on board a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter died in a fiery crash in the Kuwaiti desert Thursday en route to fighting on Iraq's Al Faw peninsula.  However, those deaths were accidents, not a result of enemy fire.  It's surprising that the first combat death occurred among Americans advancing on an oil field  urlLink rather than among the British troops facing "tough resistance" by Iraqi troops  at Umm Qasr, a coastal Iraqi town.

         IS SADDAM'S FORMER MISTRESS RIGHT OR WRONG?  One of the big stories of yesterday was the early morning broadcast from Iraq by the man on the right side of the picture above.  The content didn't matter, it was just more of the same "Jihad" against the Americans, "Allahu Akbar" (from a Baathist) and "Long Live Palestine," bunk.  What everyone wanted to know is whether the defiant speaker was actually Saddam.  Saddam,  urlLink who is known to work hard to maintain his youthful, vigorous appearance , was old, haggard, bejowled and bespectacled in the video, and many wondered if it wasn't just one of his body doubles giving the rant.  This speculation implied another -  was Saddam killed in the bombing that started the war?   Donald Rumsfeld and other officials said  urlLink there was debate over whether that was the case , and several articles laid out the technical means, such as digital image enhancement of the picture, voice analysis and measurement of facial features, by which experts tried to determine whether the video was legit.  But that wasn't all.   urlLink The U.S. government also had the video checked out by Parisoula Lampsos , who claims to have been one of Saddam's many mistresses and has passed a polygraph examination to that effect.  She has successfully distinguished Saddam from doubles a number of times in the past and said  this wasn't him.   The analysts seem to be leaning the other way.  So who do you trust, technical experts or a woman who was the guy's mistress on and off for thirty years?  Despite my natural inclination to trust science, I bet (and hope) Parisoula Lampsos is right.   UPDATE: My bet was wrong.  CIA analysts have determined that  urlLink the voice on the tape is Saddam's .  I think Lampsos is just not used to seeing Saddam looking so poorly off.  Though persistent stories say Saddam and his sons were in the bombed palace (and  urlLink this article  even cites sources saying Saddam was hauled out on a gurney), that is probably not the reason Saddam seemed out of sorts.  He was probably just tired that early in the morning and didn't have time to have his flunkies give him a script in big enough print to read without his glasses (which he tries to avoid being seen wearing).  And then there's the constant Hollywood complant: bad lighting.  The Thursday video wasn't lit so as to hide Saddam's wrinkles like his normal video recordings probably are.  If Saddam were dead, I doubt Iraq would be able to keep it secret for long.

         U.S. ATTACKS "TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY" IN IRAQ  OK, so everybody knows by now that  urlLink the war started with a strike on Baghdad .  Here's my theory: the U.S. has made it known, through its vaunted "3,000 bombs" strategy, that the war would begin with a massive mobilization of air power in order to attack.  Saddam obviously has spies watching air bases and probably even boats out in the Persian Gulf watching U.S. aircraft carriers.  Without information of a major mobilization, Saddam and his top henchmen didn't really have a huge fear of imminent attack and felt secure to move from their homes to bunkers during that time.  Knowing that big guys would be moving around in order to get into their bunkers during such a "lull," the U.S., using collaborators and Special Forces on the ground and satellites above, watched for somebody to get out and move around, then attack quickly.  Good idea, but apparently Saddam wasn't killed.  Maybe Saddam was scared by the focus on getting  him .  He looked pretty frazzled on the late-night video we saw via Al-Jazeera.  That might be even better than the 3,000 bomb strategy.

         SARS: IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S PARAMYXOVIRIDAE-FAMILY VIRUS  A frightening new virus is believed to have spread from China's Guangdong province to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, other parts of Asia, and Asian visitors from Europe and North America, causing pneumonia in hundreds and killing approximately 14 people.  Guangdong province has been a source of strange viruses, likely because humans are encroaching on places where animals live there more than in other areas.   urlLink The virus has been identified as a previously unknown member of the paramyxoviridae family , which includes ordinary childhood diseases like measles.  The new disease, known as "SARS" (for severe acute respiratory syndrome), is most frightening because of the way it has spread to health care workers involved in treatment of patients with the disease.  Medical experts have said that SARS is not as contagious as most forms of influenza, but that hasn't deterred people in China from going out and buying any kind of medicine they think might help.  Here, based on my reading of numerous news articles, I have set out my not-so-foolproof criteria for figuring out whether you have SARS:   Have you been to an affected area?   Do you live in or have you visited Guangdong Province, China? Do you live in or have you visited the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China? Do you live in or have you visited Vietnam? Do you live in or have you visited Singapore?   Have you been away from the affected area for the last 3-7 days without developing symptoms?   Do you have a high fever? Do you have a headache, sore throat, or other flu-like symptoms? Have you developed a dry cough, pneumonia, shortness of breath or other breathing difficulties? Are you currently in respiratory failure?   Have you been in contact with a victim of SARS?   Are you a doctor? Are you are a health care worker? Are you an ambulance driver?  Congratulations if you have SARS.  Hopefully your local hospital will be able to treat you with the required course of antiviral drugs and steroids and this will be successful - it isn't always.  Hopefully the hospital will also have breathing tubes to treat you if you are one of those 7% of patients who needs them.  If not, good luck with that respiratory failure thing!

         LIFE IN CRAPPY AFRICAN COUNTRY BECOMES EVEN CRAPPIER  Life in the Central African Republic, a small, corrupt, non-strategic country in the middle of Africa nobody really cares that much about, took a turn for the worse this weekend when  urlLink former Army Chief of Staff Francois Bozize overthrew President Ange-Felix Patasse  after the IMF and World Bank suspended assistance to the country (read: they were probably fed up with the way the money was being stolen).  This wasn't too hard as the Army tends to mutiny and didn't resist.  The UN's Kofi Annan has  urlLink expressed his condemnation  of the coup, which I'm sure brings cheer to the hearts of all the citizens of Bangui  urlLink living on an average of $4 a day  who've just been victims of looting.  The Presidential Palace Bozize now occupies has been looted, downtown businesses have been destroyed, and  urlLink more and more ordinary citizens are being robbed by roving bands of armed men .  France has moved in - though not to save the Central Africans from themselves.  No, the French are here to save foreigners and protect the airport.  I love that.  You ever wonder why people in the third world dislike Westerners?  Because Westerners only care about the welfare of the people of the third world when it happens to coincide with security threats to Western countries, Western citizens, or  Western interests.  The lesson from Iraq and from North Korea (where the U.S. is trying to deal with the problem) in comparison with Rwanda and the Central African Republic (about which the U.S. cares little) is this: rule your country as a vile and ruthless dictator; get weapons of mass destruction and proliferate them; work with terrorists and other rogue states; and most importantly,  realistically threaten the United States or something vital to U.S. interests .  Soon enough the sheriff should come to town.  Maybe you, the dictator,  urlLink will be hunted down and killed by members of the Delta Force .  But you should be able to rest in peace, knowing that even though the United States has destroyed your evil regime, the West will now actually give a crap about your country.   UPDATE: Maybe all this looting was just a necessary evil and the removal of former President Ange-Felix Patassé, who is now in exile in Togo, was a good idea.  Coup leader François Bozizé  urlLink was cheered as he drove through Bangui  Friday.

         NEWS FLASH: GUYS WHO WRITE COMPUTER VIRUSES DON'T HAVE GIRLFRIENDS  Apparently after years of research the folks at Reuters managed to come up with some quite  urlLink insightful conclusions . With reams of data from the IDC and an accidental push of the "obvious" button on the keyboard, it has been determined that obsessed, single guys like to make viruses--aged 14-34. Of course 34 happens to be about the top end of age for anybody that knows how to use a computer. Most current 35 year olds and up probably don't know how to write computer viruses--so apparently it has to do with guys who have gone through puberty.   After taking a biology final last friday, this somehow jumps out at me as a strange manifestation of an attempt to pass on one's genes. Since not having a girlfriend is a stressful situation for guys if they potentially cannot pass on their genes, they make something that will multiply and spread throughout the world--much like the male gametes.  Those who spam the world with their creation at a young age are particularly troubled in my view, since they assume that they will never get a girlfriend based on this theory. The underage hackers are here to stay.

         SPEECH HIGHLIGHTS FROM NYTIMES  Upon looking up the word "intransigence" I thought I would post a link to Bush's speech highlights.  urlLink Text | urlLink Video . 8PM EST Wednesday is the deadline. Of course I will be in a final during that time. I can't imagine anything is going to happen at that exact time. But as far as the dark sky thing goes, it will be a full moon in 48 hours. So I think this next weekend might be the time. Let's just say I won't be flying on an airplane for a little while.   -Gabe

         COUNTDOWN TO WAR  President Bush  urlLink plans to address the nation  (and the rest of the world) at 8:00p.m. Eastern Time.  Everybody by now knows what that means.  War is imminent.  I will be busy at the time of the address, but hope to read what Bush will say soon thereafter.  This is what I think Bush will say:  Inspections and diplomacy haven't worked because of Saddam's intransigence. Saddam is a threat to the world and his own people and it is time for him to go...And by that we mean  right now .   Saddam, either get out of Dodge or you're going to get smoked. There will be a reference to war beginning in less than 7 days He will leave out reference to specific U.N. resolutions, including 1441.  I think the bombing will begin gradually, with peripheral targets being hit to soften up the enemy a bit and make it unclear as to when the big attack is coming.  Then, about 5 days from now, we will have the promised  urlLink 3,000 bombs  dropped within 48 hours to precisely destroy key installations.  How the invasion of Baghdad will work is anybody's guess, I think it will go surprisingly well.  While I want the war to succeed, I do not want Bush emboldened by this.  This Administration has destroyed American political capital with its disregard for other countries' and leaders' opinions.  Maybe the Administration has the right policy choice (I think they do, actually).  But did that have to come at the cost of alienating the whole world needlessly?  Too many people in this Administration think that diplomacy doesn't really matter.  I just hope that they'll find out the truth of that one, and reap what they sow on some important international issue Republicans really want.  The trouble is, the Bush Administration's destruction of our image abroad will have lasting implications beyond the term Bush is in office.  That angers me.   UPDATE : I was definitely wrong about invoking specific U.N. resolutions.  Bush invoked Resolutions 678, 687,   and   1441.  As news stories said, Saddam was going to have to get out.  I didn't think of a deadline, though of course there would have to be one.  There being conditions, Bush of course had to say we would wage war "at a time of our choosing," though taken together with the 48 hour deadline, that means war within a roughly commensurate time: 2 to 5 days after Wednesday night's deadline.  My bet: Saturday night - beginning the attack after the Muslim holy day.

         urlLink   IRAQ INVITES INSPECTORS TO COME FOR A TEA PARTY!    I can just see it now. "Hello, this is Saddam. Yes, I was wondering if our two new allies, I mean chief inspectors, would like to come for a visit to Baghdad." Upon arriving in the capitol of Iraq, Hans Blix says, ok Saddam lets get down to business. Then Saddam, looks at him with a strange look, and the room gets quiet. They look at each other--the looks get intense. Then when we are sure Mr. Blix is about to be violently taken hostage, Mr. Blix bursts out laughing and causes Mr. Hussein to laugh uncontrollably. Hans Blix manages to get in between the laughing, "ok, just kidding".  Saddam says, "Ok, about this whole disarmament thing. Well, its just hard! I mean, I just don't like it--its not fair!!" Hans Blix pats Saddam on the back and says, "I know, we'll figure this out, don't cry".  Back to the real world.  Give me a friggin break!!! You messed up back in 1991 by invading Kuwait. We don't trust you to play well with others. So you can't have weapons. One proscribed weapon discovered should be the basis to take Saddam out. I mean if you find one weapon, it probably means they have plenty more where that came from and we just haven't found them yet.  It's sudden death Saddam. One illegal weapon and game's over. Its not like you get to play 3 more overtimes to find out if you could have possibly won.  My question here is, who hired Hans Blix? Because he's just saying all the right things for Iraq--and now he's going to go visit and negotiate with them about getting rid of their weapons.  Alright, lets get Saddam out of there and get this over with. Apparently Wall Street thinks we are on the verge of attacking. March 27th is the next moonless night. We shall see what happens. My bet is that we will get a presidential address and lots of news coverage on the 26th. Althought by then, Iraq will be saying, oh by the way we just happened to find some Anthrax here, whoops, we'll just destroy it really quickly.

         CHILE'S FIVE CONDITIONS  Nobody accepted all of Britain's conditions.  Not even Britain, in fact, who retracted the original requirement that Saddam Hussein get on TV and admit having not disarmed.  But Britain appears to be shaping the debate with its list of disarmament criteria.   urlLink Chile has now presented    its   list of   five   disarmament criteria, which if not met within three weeks, will allow use of military force against Iraq.  These criteria are:  Allow 30 scientists to be interviewed outside Iraq, with or without family;  This is like the British proposal.    Identify all chemical weapons produced before 1998 or prove they were destroyed;  This gets back to the "we can't prove they were destroyed, but trust us anyway" dispute with Iraq.    Identify all stocks of anthrax known to exist before 1998 or prove they were destroyed;  Ditto on the previous criterion's problems    Destroy all al-Samoud missiles and their components;  They're already doing this, which seems to mean this criterion is a pat on the back to Iraq.    Release information regarding unmanned drones so that they cannot be used to deliver chemical weapons  What information?  Why not simply require their destruction?

         ROADMAP FOR PEACE, LAST STEP FOR WAR If Palestinians appoint "real" P.M., Bush will give Middle East "roadmap"  President Bush just announced on live television from the Rose Garden that if the Palestinian Authority appoints a prime minister with real authority, the Administration will release a roadmap for peace for the region.  Bush said Israel has to get settlers out of the occupied territories, but the Palestinians must halt terror.  The announcement is not seen as putting affirmative obligations on the Israeli side.   urlLink Here are more details , though there aren't many yet: this was just on TV.  I think President Bush has now finished off the last item on its checklist, essentially admitting that the item immediately precedent on the list - a second UN resolution - is unattainable as he prepares for this weekend's summit with British Prime Minister Blair and Spanish Prime Minister Aznar.  As the March 17 "deadline" approaches I think the Administration and "coalition" will probably admit that and take further steps toward war.  This was supposedly something Powell pushed for, and it will be seen as an olive branch to Arabs, many of whom are pro-democracy and question why the Bush Administration doesn't care much about the big problem of the region: the Israeli-Arab conflict.  Now, it appears, we are ready for war.   UPDATE :  urlLink According to newer articles , President Bush apparently spoke with King Abdullah of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak before his announcement.  Here is  urlLink  the text of President Bush's statement , and  urlLink here is the video .

             SHOULD THE U.S. & BRITAIN GO TO WAR IN IRAQ? Gabe's First Post  So Tony Blair seems to be having trouble getting support from his people. Here are some thoughts.    Like the United States, if Britain is a democracy, why isn't he doing what his people are telling him to do? He is supposed to speak for his people, right?    Second, I like the debates they have in the Parliament better than congress. When Tony Blair sits there and argues, he does a great job. Get Bush to stand there in the middle of congress and talk like that and he'd probably pass out.    Third, I agree with the war in Iraq, and I think we need Britain's support. But my idea of war is that we send about 100,000 more people and start flying over Iraq out of anti-aircraft range in the middle of the night with just a huge number of planes and scare them into surrender. I don't like the idea of people dying at the hands of Americans, but in the case of Sadaam, he's probably killed more Iraqi people in "peace-time" than we would kill in war time against them. Especially, the people in the north and south regions of Iraq.   I think many conflicts can go back to kids on the playground examples. So say a bully beats up kids on the side of the playground to build up a reputation as a tough guy without getting caught. Then he decides to go sit on the big tire and tells anybody that comes near him that he will beat them up--and they believe him. So then a new kid comes to the school and says, hey I wanna play on the big tire (due to the amount of petroleum products it contains). So he sees the dude on the big tire and tells people he's going to get the big tire back for everybody to play on.   But first he needs to get the guy off the tire. So he tries to round up a bunch of people to help him get the guy off the tire. Not because he needs their help, but because then, he, this new guy won't look like a bigger bully. But the guys he enlists to help him realize he just wants to be the new bully and don't want to help him do that.   So the new bully, just decides he's going to kick this guy off the tire. But as soon as he kicks him off the tire, he realizes he doesn't want to give it up, because the tire is nice and warm in the summer and he just wants to sit on it and keep it all for himself.   So the thing is, you've gotta be really tricky if you want to enlist other people to help you get what you want. And most people think Bush is dumb, so they assume that he could never have good intentions. He just wants the tire for himself and will want to sell the petroleum products himself.   So what do you do? Before you go beat up the guy on the tire, you say, I have 100 bullets in my gun, you only have 10, so I get 90% of the tire and you get 10%. If you produce more bullets by tomorrow, you can have more of the tire. You split up the tire.   Moral of the story, behind closed doors, divide up the oil pie right now. We can take it all now, but it will not be a good idea because it'll permanently position the US in a very powerful position, with a cheap supply of oil for years. Britain is the home of BP and probably has a good chunk of its governments budget coming from taxing the oil company. This is not cheap oil, but DIRT cheap oil if we can get it. Cheap labor, lots of it, easy to get to--its cheap oil at its finest with a big water port very close.   Its much more valuable than the amount of money we'll spend on the war. And every other country knows that. If we take the oil for ourselves, we would control the world quite handidly. It would create a lot of resentment against us by countries like China and India (the only two more populous countries in the world than the US) and would probably lead us into another arms race against those countries since they would be thinking the US might target them if they happen to have something that the US wants. The US is just being greedy here. We need to share.   Why do I support the war? Because it will support the position of the US as the massive superpower that it is. We are within the top 5 countries in size in the world, the 3rd largest by population and by far the biggest consumers of everything in the world. So we need the energy source to keep going--but in order to get it without other people resenting us, we need to share.   So big surprise the only countries against us are the ones who have aspirations to be the biggest and best countries in the world (France, Russia)--no matter the size of population and country size. Britain is our buddy. Why? Because our banks and companies are practically intertwined. If Britains economy sank, we'd probably be hurting too. The other countries that are with us on the UN resolution are countries that have made deals to get paid by the US for stuff. Mexico, Spain, other countries like those are just thinking, ok more new jobs are coming our way. Scratch the back of the superpower, and you get scratched back. The other countries are holding out for more right now I bet.   Anyway. So it seems like Iraq is going to try to look like it is complying, but is really just proving the way Sadaam is... play all sorts of psychological games to make him not look so bad. So it looks like he is going to tell us what he did with his VX and anthrax now. But wow, he waits until about the day of reckoning to say something about it. Hmm, this seems like good old Sadaam here...   oh well, enough on that for now, but man lets get rid of this guy... he's gonna be making biological weapons until the day he dies if we don't get rid of him...   -Gabe

         CHIMACUM LOSES AT STATE  The Chimacum boys basketball team (14-14), led by senior Robbie Andrus,  urlLink faced off against Nooksack Valley  (22-1) and got clobbered  urlLink by a score of 70-42 .  But they still have a game to play in the consolation round.  In districts, Chimacum lost to Eatonville before beating them to go to state, so they won't necessarily just curl up and die now.  However, their opponent today looks tough: Othello (15-10)  urlLink almost beat top-ranked Hoquiam  (24-0), the favorite to win the AA championship this year.  Amazing run, anyway.

         SURRENDER TALKS  According to U.S. officials confirm that  urlLink surrender talks have begun with key Iraqi military officials .  The Billings Gazette (of all papers!) says that the source of this information was  urlLink Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .  The officials involved  urlLink were apparently suprised and unhappy  that Rumsfeld had revealed this information.  I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't make getting Iraqis to surrender more difficult - Saddam can still kill them until the U.S. is ready to take over.  Rumsfeld's also made Tony Blair's life more difficult by saying  urlLink the U.S. could go to war without British troops .  Great job.  Rumsfeld's reputation as a straight-shooter is all well and good, but does he have to say   everything   he's thinking or knows about?  You wonder if Rummy doesn't enjoy his press conferences a little too much.

         BLAIR'S SIX BENCHMARKS  Tony Blair is walking a fine line, and  urlLink his political skills cannot protect him indefinitely .  The British public and his Labour Party are rebelling against him, though Blair's only known possible successor,  urlLink Gordon Brown , has come out in support of him.  Blair's survival, and British support for a war on Iraq, appears conditioned on UN authorization of military action.  The Bush Administration, pushing members of the Security Council to agree to authorize a war, has shown few signs of flexibility beyond changing its March 17 deadline by a few days and has, in effect, said that Iraq's disarmament must satisfy the United States, rather than meet any objective criteria.  Needing agreement,  urlLink Blair has proposed standards for disarmament  that, if not met would justify war on Iraq.  These are Blair's  urlLink six disarmament "benchmarks"  with my comments in italics:  A television appearance by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein renouncing weapons of mass destruction.  Maybe if it's going to be  urlLink an interview with Dan Rather on CBS .  If it has to be shown on Iraqi television, Saddam won't do it.  He can't capitulate in front of his own population - he's too afraid for his own survival.  He'd also have to admit to having had weapons of mass destruction and having caused all the misery his people have suffered because he wouldn't give them up.    Iraq's permitting 30 key weapons scientists to travel to Cyprus to be interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors.  Saddam might let them go.  But if their extended families and friends can't come along, these interviews will be fruitless.  There will always be someone Saddam can kill, until his regime is removed.  The scientists would have to either give up nothing, or know individually that they could give up enough information to justify war and the rescue of their extended families and friends.  Faced with those two choices, key Iraqi scientists, most of whom probably favor the regime, would reveal almost nothing of value.    Destruction "forthwith'' of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons Iraq is allegedly holding.  So Iraq would have to give up a smoking gun  and  the only thing that makes the U.S. and Britain truly afraid of invading?  Saddam can't give that up.  Saddam would also have to prove that the materials were destroyed.  Unless someone from the U.S. or Britain is on site to verify destruction of these materials, proof may be very difficult.    Surrender of and explanation about biological weapons production.  Give up the smoking gun and give the international community arguments why Saddam Hussein is dangerous and regime change is the only way to solve the problem?  No way.    Commitment to destroy proscribed missiles.  Well, they're doing this already.  But it's a bad benchmark, as Iraq can turn compliance on and off, destroying or stopping the destruction of illegal missiles when it wants.  And this would probably require that Iraq also give up missiles it was to use for its chemical and biological weapons programs, which it would be admitting exist.    Accounting for unmanned aerial vehicles.  Iraq was caught dismantling some of these the other day.  It probably can't account for them all and explaining why not would reveal that Iraq has not been cooperating with weapons inspectors in good faith.  HOWEVER, the benchmarks aren't for Saddam.  They're for the Security Council's consumption.  Maybe they're palatable to a few undecided countries.  But the U.S. and U.K.'s opponents on the Security Council will never let these benchmarks become the basis of a new resolution as they presuppose Iraq's lying rather than "substantially complying" as Hans Blix has said.  They would be an incitement to war rather than a justification for any further delay, and Russia, France and Germany cannot accept them.  That's bad for the U.S. and U.K., but especially for Blair, who I think is a good prime minister and the only "new left" politician still in charge of a major country (I think Schroeder is officially off the wagon).  If Blair doesn't get authorization for war, he could be forced from office.  That makes me mad that the Bush Administration put Blair in this position.  I'm certain his replacement would be worse for Britain's domestic and foreign policy and a poor ally to the United States.

         PADILLA HAS A RIGHT TO COUNSEL AT LEAST UNTIL APPEAL . . .  Michael Mukasey, Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York, today issued a  urlLink strongly worded opinion  in which he refused to reverse his  urlLink December ruling  that Jose Padilla ( urlLink a.k.a. Abdullah al Muhajir, a.k.a. the Dirty Bomber, a.k.a. the Chicago gang member turned Al Qaeda operative ) has a right to counsel like other American citizens, residents, and most everybody else outside of  urlLink Guantanamo Bay  (whose denizens, the D.C. Circuit  urlLink ruled today  don't to have a right to counsel), Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Diego Garcia, or any of the  urlLink undisclosed locations  where alleged Al Qaeda operatives are being held.  Not that I'm skeptical about U.S. operations against Al Qaeda (though they've picked up  urlLink a few Afghan and Pakistani farmers and deposited them in Cuba  and suspiciously  urlLink killed a few others ) it's just that federal courts seem to work pretty well in dealing with terror suspects.  Does anybody really doubt that real terrorists will be convicted or that courts and lawyers can keep secret evidence confidential?  The World Trade Center bombers were convicted, Timothy McVeigh was executed and who really thinks  urlLink Zacarias Moussaoui  won't be convicted even if he's given the freedom to write as many  urlLink goofy motions  as he can dream up and  urlLink fire and fight with his court-appointed lawyers ?  Conservatives in the Bush Administration are afraid of taking on the ACLU and liberal judges because they could restrict their freedom to fight terrorism.  They aren't absolutely stupid, that is a possibility, though the way the federal courts acted during World War I, World War II, and the McCarthy Era may cause one to make the opposite inference.  I worry more about the negative effects of giving free rein to law enforcement on terrorism issues.  It's not hard to see how sweeping new laws for fighting terrorism like the Patriot Act (and the potential " urlLink Patriot Act II ") or decisions  urlLink allowing detention based on minimal amounts of evidence  can be applied to ordinary citizens, though they aren't being applied that way right now.  That's why I'm happy Padilla gets a right to counsel.  A line has to be drawn somewhere.  Padilla is an  urlLink American citizen captured on American soil , just alleged to be an  urlLink enemy combatant .  The fact that his crime has an international terrorism-related component shouldn't mean Padilla no longer has the same rights accorded to him when he was punished for  urlLink murder, for shooting at fellow drivers, and for assaulting a prison guard .

         IRAQ U-2 CONFRONTATION   urlLink Iraq has threatened American U-2 planes  flying over its territory for the United Nations, in violation of the terms of  urlLink Resolution 1441  and previous Security Council resolutions.  I think the Iraqi regime obviously believes war is inevitable and they aren't planning on going along with the inspection regime.  Even though they've tried to back away from this, they're showing their true colors - cooperation with the inspectors is not Iraq's real goal.  Russia has tried to downplay this, saying UNMOVIC doesn't consider this a provocation or a violation (which would have to be reported) while the U.S. has said Iraq considers one U-2 OK, but two U-2s (like the two that flew this morning) a hostile action.  It seems that when Iraq agreed to unconditional overflights a few weeks ago the "unconditional" part wasn't clear enough.  Iraq is trying to get out of this situation by explaining the U-2 confrontation as a  urlLink technical dispute .  Iraqi fighter jets threatened one of the planes, or both depending on who you ask.   urlLink Iraqi UN liaison and Major General Hossam Mohammed Amin said  that Iraq was not aware a second U-2 overflight was scheduled and the flight came into Iraqi airspace from Saudi Arabia, not Kuwait as usual, and the U.S. was just looking for an excuse for war.

         NO MORE INDIAN MASCOTS  Seattle's public schools will no longer have American Indian-related mascots: no more Indians, Braves, Chiefs.

I like having a cross-county rivalry with mascots that reflect that, but obviously the Redskin thing   has got to go  .  My suggestion: the Port Townsend  Sheepherders .  I know, I know, while there are lots of cows in Chimacum, there aren't many sheep in Port Townsend.  My response: how many Indians are there in Port Townsend?  I think everybody plays up the conflict between cowboys and Indians while neglecting the tragic conflict that was the fencing of the open range in the West so that sheep could graze (I'm hilarious, I know).    Oh, and by the way, Washington, D.C. (where I live now), known for its high African-American population, should try changing its mascot to something that insults blacks.  That'll go over well.  The Washington Bullets  urlLink changed their name  because associating DC's team with shooting violence hit a little bit close to home, as D.C. was long also the nation's  urlLink murder capital .  It's now behind Youngstown, Ohio, my girlfriend's home town (but they can't keep us down for long).  I think part of reason the name had to change related to the fact that blacks are too often stereotyped as being violent.  Actually I have heard that the reason why Redskins owner Dan Snyder moved to the spear logo was so that he could  urlLink change the name from Redskins  after a few years - maybe after that championship he's trying to buy.  Maybe we'll have the  urlLink Washington Warriors .  I just hope no one will associate the spear with an African-American slur instead of an American Indian one.  It's not easy choosing a good mascot.  Maybe it's best to stick with a color - like the  urlLink Cleveland Browns  . . . .  Maybe that's not a good example.

         IRAQ TRIED TO DISMANTLE DRONES  UNMOVIC Inspectors visiting the Ibn Fernas Center in Baghdad  urlLink found Iraqis dismantling undeclared drone aircraft .  The inspectors were apparently unexpected.  So Iraq didn't just  inadvertently  not declare materials it was required to under Resolution 1441: the Iraqi regime is hiding stuff and trying to prevent its discovery, just like it has been for the last 12 years.  And Blix now backs off of his earlier soft-pedaling of this news, saying  urlLink Iraq should have declared these drones .  I am starting to wonder what his motives are.  I think Blix doesn't want a smoking gun.  He wants to tread the middle and not come down on the American, European, or Iraqi sides.  Blix just wants to be a weapons inspector, even if keeping that job requires ignoring the results of some weapons inspections.

         AL QAEDA ARRESTS CONTINUE, BIN LADEN IN REACH?  In the wake of what appear to be increased investigations following the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, 10 Al Qaeda operatives were arrested today.  Among their number was an Egyptian or Afghan identified only as Masood, who  urlLink a Pakistani source believes was in contact with Osama Bin Laden via satellite phone .  Monitoring and using information gathered from telephone conversations seems to have done a lot to damage Al Qaeda.  The U.S.'s Echelon monitoring system has apparently  urlLink played a large part  in the search.  Now if only this Bin Laden story were true and the U.S. could pinpoint his location using modern technology rather than hunting rock-by-rock and house-by-house through places like Waziristan or Peshawar.  It would be convenient, wouldn't it?  Bin Laden captured on the eve of an Iraq invasion?   UPDATE:  urlLink Newsweek has reported  that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was in part captured due to the $25 million offered by the United States for his capture.  Along with $2 million to relocate to Britain.  Hopefully the money will get some Al Qaeda guys to flip and turn in Osama Bin Laden.

          ATTACK OF THE DRONES  Secretary of State Powell is mad that Hans Blix didn't inform the Security Council that Iraq has drone aircraft that can be outfitted to serve as chemical or biological weapons delivery devices.  Powell apparently referred to the drone aircraft in his February 5 presentation to the Security Council, but Blix did not refer to the drone aircraft's capabilities in his Friday presentation, though this information is included in an updated 173-page report by Blix released  after  Friday's meeting took place.  In Resolution 1441, the Security Council specifically required that such drones be declared, but Iraq obviously did not do so.   urlLink The New York Times is reporting  that the same report contains information that Iraq has been cobbling together rockets with cluster warheads suitable for chemical weapons delivery.  The U.S. official who showed this information to the New York Times also showed a picture of the weapon, which was supposedly being built at a place called Haidar Farm.  Intelligence analysis for UN weapons inspectors in 1997 regarding weapons produced there indicated that Iraq had all the necessary information to build chemical warheads for missiles Iraq already owns.

         WAS BIN LADEN HIMSELF SOUGHT IN NIMROZ?

Now the raft of conflicting stories includes another perspective: former Taliban diplomat Naseer Ahmed Roohi said that  urlLink Bin Laden himself was actually in that area just before a U.S. operation  there.  Military spokesman Colonel Roger King has said that the United States wasn't undertaking any operations there over the last 72 hours.

         HOW DID ERDOGAN END UP IN OFFICE?  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of Turkey's Justice and Development Party (a moderate Islamist party)  urlLink has been elected to Parliament  and will become Prime Minister.  Previously barred from office because he recited a well-known poem that "incited religious hatred," his party's majority in Parliament was able to amend the Constitution and allow him to come into office and go from simply being the power behind the throne to Prime Minister.    While stories say that this will give the U.S. another chance to base American forces in Turkey for a war on Iraq, my question is how the Turkey's supra-constitutional authority allowed this constitutional amendment and why they let Erdogan take office despite their opposition to Islamic parties and Islamist leaders.  Is it because Turkey's military thinks Erdogan will be able to get the people to go along with an invasion?  Is it because the military are afraid of a more Islamist party?  Is it because the mainstream parties have failed the Turkish people?  Maybe it's all of these things.  I just hope Erdogan does a good job.   More thoughts:  the Turkish military may want the chance to invade Kurdistan so bad that it's more willing to go along with a mildly Islamist government that will give it that chance.  Ordinary people don't want to invade Iraq, but the military wants to deal with Kurds it sees as terrorists.

         U.S. LEAFLETS ANALYZED  U.S. planes dropped a number of different leaflets over Iraq last week.  I think these let you in on what U.S. military planners are thinking about in attacking Iraq.     urlLink Leaflet #1  The U.S. thinks Iraq has biological, chemical, or maybe even nuclear weapons and we are afraid they may be used against American invasion forces.  The U.S. is probably not overly concerned about conventional warfare, but use of weapons of mass destruction does bother the U.S. military.   urlLink Leaflet #2  The U.S. thinks oil will be used as a weapon, probably to make it hard to travel up Iraqi waterways or land on Iraqi beaches.  The U.S. also believes Iraqis will have greater loyalty to their families than to Saddam.   urlLink Leaflet #3  The U.S. thinks Iraqi military forces can be persuaded to surrender or desert the military.  A pretty typical propaganda leaflet over time, but many people think a large number of Iraqi forces, maybe even most of those outside of the Republican Guards, will surrender.   urlLink Leaflet #4  The U.S. needs to communicate with Iraqi civilians to counter information being fed to them by Iraqi propaganda radio and television.  Radio may have been chosen rather than television because TV is impossible, or maybe because the U.S. doesn't have a good TV face for U.S. forces in Iraq.   urlLink Leaflet #5  The U.S. fears Iraqi antiaircraft weapons may damage or down U.S. airplanes, and is threatening retribution for use of antiaircraft weapons.   urlLink Leaflet #6  The U.S. is trying to avoid angering the Iraqi public and is looking forward to an occupation.  That is why it says it will not destroy Iraqi monuments or harm the Iraqi people if they avoid military personnel.   urlLink Leaflet #7  The U.S. really wants people to listen to U.S. propaganda/information radio.  U.S. forces may actually have information they need to communicate.  I wonder what.   urlLink Leaflet #8  This  leaflet, which does not have an English analogue, has been translated as saying, "'Do not help the Iraqi military or leaders of the regime to flee."  The U.S. does not want Saddam or other Baathists to escape in order to return at a later time.  If they do, they may just wait out a U.S. occupation and then come back and try to come back to power.   urlLink Leaflet #9  Once again, the U.S. wants to communicate with Iraqis, to inform them of the badness of Saddam's regime.  I wonder if this won't just help people who are used to Saddam's rhetoric adapt to what Americans want to hear when the U.S. occupies Iraq.  Maybe this is good in terms of a "de-Baathification."     urlLink Yahoo's slide show of these leaflets.

          NORTH KOREANS SOUGHT HOSTAGES?  A senior defense official said the North Korean jets that intercepted a U.S. spy plane over the Sea of Japan (and painted it with radar, a threatening act) were  urlLink trying to get it to follow (presumably back to base) and kidnap its crew .  This of course evokes the Chinese interception of an American spy plane off Hainan Island and holding of its crew.  North Korea probably was inspired by that course of events.  Kim Jong Il probably thought a hostage-taking would lead to negotiation with the United States as it did with China.  Everyone says North Korea is trying to get attention.  Why?  Because it sucks there.  But this latest event proves that attention is not all that North Korea wants.  Kim Jong Il wants   hostages  .  He already has South Korea hostage because Seoul is so close to the DMZ and now wants Japan and the United States to be its hostages as well.  North Korea is a thug state - it cannot support itself so must either beg or steal.  Its leaders' egotism leads it to try to commit armed robbery writ large.  Its threats regarding its nuclear program (which is internal, not a direct threat to its neighbors) have not obtained satisfactory results, so now it wants to hold the United States hostage in a more direct manner.  I'm kind of glad Bush isn't dealing with North Korea first.  This will make North Korea's leaders feel like the second-rate thugs that they are.  Next, once Saddam is taken out, North Korea will be the one true threat out there (despite the "axis of evil" rhetoric, Iran   cannot   be dealt with like Iraq).  The U.S. may have a way to take out the North Korean military before they are able to destroy Seoul or use their nuclear weapons.  But I bet there are ways to put force the implosion of the North Korean regime without a direct attack, and if North Korea is the main security focus, the Bush Administration may just be able to make that happen.

         ST. PATRICK'S DAY DEADLINE FOR SADDAM  Though Britain (along with the U.S. and Spain) have only floated this date in today's UN resolution, they have effectively set a March 17 deadline for war against Iraq.  Something makes me think Saddam won't have the luck of the Irish, though I might suggest that he consume large amounts of green beer on that day.

         BIN LADEN CORNERED? HIS SONS CAPTURED? RUMORS SWIRL   urlLink The Washington Post reports  that  Sardar Sanaullah Zehri, the home minister of Pakistan's Baluchistan province, says that a joint U.S.-Pakistani operation to take out Al Qaeda forces in Rabat, Afghanistan resulted in the capture of Osama bin Laden's sons Saad and Hamza.  This is disputed strongly by U.S. counterterrorism officials.   urlLink Reuters quotes Zehri  as saying that because the raid took place in Afghanistan, Pakistani forces were not involved, and Zehri also says later that  urlLink he did not know  whether Bin Laden's sons were among the captives.  In addition, the governor of Nimroz, the Afghan province in which the operation allegedly took place, said  urlLink no arrests were being made .  As USA Today notes, this is just one story full of conflicts to come out over the last few days - some of which indicate Osama Bin Laden himself has either been captured or cornered.  The truth seems to be that  urlLink operations seeking to find him seem to have intensified, at least somewhat .  Some of the best stories I've seen  relating to the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed are coming out of Australia's  urlLink The Age .  One from March 7 details how the U.S.  urlLink manipulated Mohammed's communications  in order to capture him.  An article by Zahid Hussain in the Melbourne Herald Sun says Bin Laden himself was tracked because of his cell phone use.  Another good  urlLink March 8 article  in  urlLink The Age  (remember, they're on the other side of the world) follows the rumors regarding the capture of Bin Laden mentioned above.  An interesting idea raised in the article is that some people want to see Bin Laden killed, but not report the murder, so that he will fade away instead of being allowed to become a martyr.

         INFORMATION FROM KHALID SHAIKH MOHAMMED  Mohammed has supposedly  urlLink described meeting with Osama bin Laden only one month ago , and documentary evidence Mohammed was captured with supports this.  Mohammed also had information indicating Ayman al-Zawahiri, another important Al Qaeda leader, had  urlLink recently returned to Pakistan .  Pakistani officials also suggested that Mohammed had been sold out by someone  within Al Qaeda, and that the $25 million reward for help leading to his capture may have played a large part in that.  Is Al Qaeda unraveling?  Hopefully.  Will it be destroyed?  Eventually the named organization Al Qaeda will be destroyed.  It would probably be most damaged if the United States could show Osama bin Laden in a cage.  However, something will always continue to replace it until the problems leading to its existence are solved.  Al Qaeda is just a head of the hydra - it is what is attacking you, and so you go after it, but it will quickly be replaced even if you cut its head off.  What you have to do is go for the body and kill the hydra.  That requires a more comprehensive strategy for engagement with the Islamic world.

         CAN THE POPE LABEL THE BUSH DOCTRINE UNJUST?  Today is Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent.  The big news of the day, at least for a Catholic like me, is  urlLink Pope John Paul II's big effort to halt President Bush's drive to remove Saddam Hussein  and his Tikriti/Baathist regime in Iraq.  The pope has said that an American war, which will neither respond to aggression or preempt an imminent attack, will not be a just war.  The pope is making a public push to prevent the war through sermonizing and calling for Catholics to pray and fast for peace.  He even  urlLink sent a papal envoy , Cardinal Pio Laghi, a former papal nuncio during the time of President Bush the Elder.  It is ironic that the signature " urlLink Bush Doctrine "of the most Christian of our recent presidents would be singled out by the pope as unjust.  I remember from history class [I later saw  urlLink the famous Cronkite interview ] how, when JFK ran for President, there was still the question of whether a Catholic could be President.  There was a question as to whether a Catholic would consider himself beholden to the Pope and whether he would be forced to follow the Pope's infallible guidance to the detriment of the United States.  Well, JFK was elected, so obviously the American people didn't consider it   that   much of a problem.  But a related problem - how much authority a pope should wield in the gray area between purely moral issues and purely governmental issues - is still a difficult issue.  "Just war" is one of these gray area issues.  The Church has not adopted a pacifist stance.  Instead,  urlLink some wars are considered just and others unjust .  The big issue for me is basically this: how much should the pope, a moral leader, second-guess a national leader's decision on when to go to war and how the war is to be fought?  The use of force just one part of a larger security policy.  If, for example, Iraq is producing nuclear weapons, must an American president wait until Saddam Hussein appears likely to use these weapons on his neighbors before attacking?  Must the U.S. wait until Saddam is preparing to use chemical or biological weapons on his own people or on his neighbors to attack?   [This is actually one of my greatest concerns - a nonproliferation strategy requires the threat of use of force and a failure of nonproliferation will ultimately put weapons in the hands of people who are  very  unlikely to wage a just war]   Or may an attack be justified if the threat is inevitable, or leaving a man like Saddam in power leads inevitably to a threat of war.  This seems like a difficult call to make, one made based on practical necessity.  To draw an analogy, must you allow a man to live that you know will attack you when your back is turned?  When you know that he will kill one of your friends?  I can't fault the pope for being concerned.  However, I believe in the end that the practical consideration of what threat Saddam poses is something the pope cannot decide.  Where the pope speaks on moral matters, he is infallible, but on other issues he is not.  I believe that the way in which a war is waged is something for practical decisionmakers.   UPDATE : Jimmy Carter, Nobel Prize winner and America's 39th President (and probably the closest thing the U.S. has to a "secular" pope) on Sunday March 9 said a  urlLink U.S. war against Iraq will not be a just war .  Carter, a devout Southern Baptist, has said that the Southern Baptist Convention has only come out in favor of this war because of their deep commitment to Israel due to conservative Christian thoughts on the end of the world.

         IS MOHAMMED AT BAGRAM AIR BASE?  It appears I'm wrong about Mohammed being on Diego Garcia.  Pakistan's Information Minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed,  urlLink said Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is still in the region  (that is, near Pakistan) and "Most probably he is in Afghanistan."  Reporters have asked whether the U.S. is holding Mohammed at  urlLink Bagram Air Base , its headquarters in Afghanistan, and got a standard "we don't give out that kind of information" denial.  It was noted that Bagram Air Base is where some prisoners were held before being transported to the U.S. Navy facility at Guantanamo Bay.  Bagram Air Base does have an interrogation center, and reputedly there has been some  urlLink less than humane treatment  there.    That makes me think White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer's statements yesterday that  urlLink Mohammed was being treated humanely  may actually be an oblique reference to Bagram Air Base.  Fleischer may have simply wanted to clarify that in its efforts to extract information from Mohammed, the U.S. is treating him according to international laws and norms (so U.S. soldiers won't be tortured if captured in Iraq?) OR .....[DUM DAH  DUMM! ] Fleischer may have been trying to head off a line of questioning about Mohammed's treatment based on what he believed the press may soon discover, that Mohammed is being held at Bagram Air Base.  Oh, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's Al Qaeda co-conspirator, who has been previously identified as an  urlLink Egyptian and later as a Somali , is now thought to be a Saudi named Mustafa Ahmed al-Hasawi, an Al Qaeda paymaster with ties to Mohammed Atta and the September 11

         WHERE'S MY COFFEE?  This is what Khalid Shaikh Mohammed looked like when he was arrested in Rawalpindi, Pakistan Saturday night.  The hair is bad, but the guy has enough hair on his chest, back and shoulders to make  urlLink Alf  jealous.   urlLink According to U.S. counterterrorism sources , he was planning an attack at the time.  The other interesting thing is that he was found with computers, disks, cell phones and documents, which hopefully will lead  urlLink somewhere .  Stories now say that Mohammed is being interrogated by U.S., um ... interrogators in a undisclosed location.  They also say that one of his associates was a Somali, and the other, Pakistani Ahmed Abdul Qadoos, was actually so mentally incapable he could not finish junior high school.  I could imagine their misadventures and hi-jinks they must have had.  It sounds like a low-budget rip-off of  urlLink O Brother, Where Art Thou?    urlLink This article  reminds readers that in addition to Mr. Mohammed, terrorist masterminds Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi Binalshibh are also being held in undisclosed locations abroad.  Maybe Diego Garcia?  Not like they would ever know, even if they were in the same cell block.  But I can just imagine these three devious Islamic terrorists escaping their cells, taking over the island and threatening the world, like the evil bad guys from a James Bond (or Austin Powers) movie.

           WHERE'S WALDO?   urlLink In a tremendous coup , Pakistani authorities and CIA officers today captured Al Qaeda field general  urlLink Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  in the city of Rawalpindi, along with two other Al Qaeda suspects.  He was whisked out of the country and whether he was in U.S. custody or where he was headed was unclear.  My thoughts on where he might be:  Because of his senior status within the organization, there is a strong expectation that he knows a lot about Al Qaeda's operations in progress or in planning, how Al Qaeda is run, who is who, and where they are.  Some wishful thinkers suggest that he may even know of Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts.  This means, more than anything else, the U.S. wants him to pump him for information - as much as it can get. If he's a tough guy who won't talk under normal American standards of interrogation, he may be given to another government, one that does not have such compunctions.  [ The Israelis?  The Pakistanis?  Afghans?   The French?  ] Whether the U.S. can do this with foreknowledge of torture is dubious, but who's to call them on it? If the U.S takes him, I'd bet he'd first be shipped to Diego Garcia, because of its security, remoteness, and the military facilities there. He may end up with his Al Qaeda comrades at Guantanamo Bay, "Cuba" (along as some  urlLink regular Afghans  who were in the worst possible place at the worst possible time) If Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's in Pakistan, they sure as heck won't let anyone know he's still there.  This would probably incite terrorist responses, disturbances and demonstrations/riots, especially if Pakistani extremists figure out where he is being held.  urlLink This article  in today's Washington Post says Mohammed and the Arab with whom he was captured were transferred to U.S. custody and sent to a U.S. detention center, whose location is only known to be "outside Pakistan."  The article says the reason for all the secrecy is anti-American sentiment in Pakistan as a U.S.(-led) war against Iraq looms on the horizon.   UPDATE:  Pakistan Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said today that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is  urlLink still in the custody of Pakistani law enforcement  (and inside Pakistan).  This was confirmed by Pervez Musharraf's spokesman, Rashid Qureshi.   I would bet the source of the statement that Mohammed was out of the country was concerned about the potential for disturbances I mentioned above and didn't want to reveal that Mohammed was still in the country.   Not that I should be congratulating myself or anything.  U.S. officials said Saturday that Mohammed is expected to be interrogated in an undisclosed foreign country, and the Pakistani source could have just been anticipating what he expected to happen.  INTERESTING FACT:  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  urlLink is the uncle  of World Trade Center Round I bomber  urlLink Ramzi Yousef .  Great family.

         CAREFUL BALANCING ACT IN IRAQ  President Bush said today that to avoid war, Iraq would not only have to disarm - Saddam Hussein must also be deposed.  I've noticed over time that there are a number of careful balances, or less artfully put, contradictions, the Bush Administration has to deal with in its Iraq policymaking:  Saddam Hussein must be deposed,  BUT  before that, he must get rid of his weapons of mass destruction.   The Bush Administration is encouraging Saddam's generals to depose him,  BUT  It promises to transition to democracy  AND  To prosecute hard-core associates of Saddam for war crimes or crimes against humanity.   The Administration wants help from Iraqi Kurds, so it has essentially ensured their freedom from oppression within a liberated Iraq  BUT  The Administration wants Turkish help, so it has to allow Turkish troops to enter the Kurdish parts of Iraq - would Turkey occupy the area or attempt to capture its Kurdish enemies living in the  de facto  independent Kurdish areas?   The U.S., whether using the UN formally or not, must clear the way for war before it acts,  BUT  It has to do this before the end of March, or it likely won't be able to fight Saddam until the fall (due to stifling summer heat).   The Administration wants international support and to work with its allies,  BUT  not to change, or appear to change, any of its behavior based on the opinions of other nations' leaders.   The UN must strengthen itself and prove its relevance,  BUT   To prove its relevance, the UN must allow the United States to act as if it were entirely irrelevant.  More to follow as I think of them.

        MUST PALESTINE WIN ITS INDEPENDENCE?  After seeing  urlLink yet another story  about how Palestinian militants (in this case Hamas) rejected a peace plan for Palestine/Israel (the Bush roadmap), I wonder if the Palestinians will not accept a peaceful compromise that will lead to their independence.  I am starting to think that a peaceful process to independence does not jibe with the Palestinian self-image as an oppressed people who must rise against their oppressors.  My thought is that to move from that state of oppression to independence requires the creation of a Palestinian national myth of independence like that of the United States.  The only way to achieve that is to achieve victory through violent means, by beating your oppressor and freeing yourself.  Being freed leaves a person feeling subject to the mercy of another and less of a person.  It also leaves you feeling like you could lose your freedom again or that the freedom you have been given is incomplete.  Breaking one's chains, defeating one's enemy, gives a true sense of freedom.  That spirit seems to be at least in part behind this statement from Sheik Ahmed Yassin of Hamas: "Our resistance is continuing and it will continue and no one will stop it. We should not drop our weapons before we get our rights." The problem for the realization of Palestinian freedom is that in its strongest forms, which are often the forms associated with the sense of vanquishing the Israeli enemy, the Palestinian cause is incompatible with an Israel Israelis can accept.  As Yassin also said: "We will pursue resistance and self-defense until the removal of the occupation and settlements from our land, and until our people return." Yassin and those like him believe Palestinian Arabs have a right to return to their previous homes in Israel and want the entire Holy Land.  What we need to do, and I say this with all seriousness, is redirect the Palestinians so that they can have a myth of battle-won independence that is compatible with the Israel that currently exists.  Let them forget about Israel itself after the Israelis build their wall.  What the Israelis should do is move every soldier in Palestine onto the border/wall and let the Palestinians rule themselves.  And, most importantly, let the Palestinians kill all the settlers who are not smart enough to leave when the leaving is good or (as is unlikely) live in peace with their Palestinian rulers.  That can be the Palestinian independence myth: the vanquishing of the Israeli settlers.

        ECONOMISTS ON THE TAX CUT  I didn't analyze the tax-cut-as-stimulus idea the same way the economists did, but it seems  urlLink I did catch the major logical flaw  in President Bush's argument, which ended up in the  urlLink Washington Post : Some members of Congress support tax relief but say my proposal is too big," Bush said in his Saturday radio address. "Since they already agree that tax relief creates jobs, it doesn't make sense to provide less tax relief and, therefore, create fewer jobs."   But few economists would argue that tax policy is so straightforward. Taken to its extreme, Joel Slemrod  [pictured above] , a tax economist at the University of Michigan, said that Bush's argument would support eliminating taxes altogether for the sake of job creation.   "Logically, the statement that more tax cuts are better is certainly wrong," Slemrod said. The economics seem to indicate that the economic state of the country is not just a question of how much money is put into the economy, because over the course of the Bush Administration losses have been exceeded by recent tax cuts and huge spending.  In the long run (say, 4 years from now),  urlLink the article  also said, the Bush Administration tax cuts would raise interest rates and lower savings rates and, due to higher return for investment income, there would be less jobs created.

        THE FIFTH PLANE THEORY: CAN THE U.S. CONVICT MOUSSAOUI?  Zacarias Moussaoui is a member of Al Qaeda and openly committed to the destruction of the United States at a time when Osama bin Laden and his associates are on the run.  He was arrested in Minnesota after trying to get flying lessons related to a hijacking, but it doesn't seem that prosecutors can actually figure out what he was going to do next, let alone  prove  what he was going to do next.  I'm sure the prosecution team is wishing it had sent Moussaoui  urlLink to a naval brig  or  urlLink Guantanamo Bay .  They're probably wishing they could have convinced Judge Brinkema to accept Moussaoui's early guilty plea.  It seems the original theory was that Moussaoui would be the 20th hijacker.  As part of this theory, government prosecutors probably wanted to show that Moussaoui was somehow going to work in concert with the other hijackers and to join them in their hijackings.   However, it seems that prosecutorsdo not have sufficient proof of that theory, as Moussaoui was far away from the hijackers, who otherwise seemed to be working as a coherent group.  Moussaoui has also claimed that he is not working with this group and has sought information from Al Qaeda operative Ramzi Binalshibh in order to prove this as Binalshibh apparently made statements to that effect.  Prosecutors have now moved on to attempt to prove that Moussaoui was part of the September 11 attacks in another way - he planned to hijack a fifth plane.  While this may not be that much easier to prove, the government must at least present some coherent theory tying him to the September 11 attacks because it is attempting to charge Moussaoui with conspiracy in order to tie him to the murders of the September 11 victims.  A conspiracy charge usually requires that the government show:  at least two persons' agreement to commit a crime intent to enter into the agreement intent to actually do the act, usually through some overt act. How the government is going to show that Moussaoui did anything besides look for flight lessons is unclear.  This is probably in part because the facts are classified, but it must   at least in part be related to problems of proof , or the government wouldn't have to change its theory of the case.  What I begin to wonder now is what the U.S. government will do now that it is becoming clear that it does not have a legally sufficient case against Zacarias Moussaoui ( i.e., Judge Brinkema may not allow a jury to convict him due to evidentiary weaknesses).  The one sure thing is that the U.S. will not send Moussaoui back to France any time soon.

         BUSH, VOINOVICH AND THE TAX CUT  I love this argument from the White House:  urlLink Some members of Congress support tax relief, but say my proposal is too big. Since they already agree that tax relief creates jobs, it doesn't make sense to provide less tax relief and, therefore, create fewer jobs.  I love that logic.  How about instead of $550 billion or $750 billion in tax cuts, we give $2 trillion in tax cuts?  Or how about we eliminate taxes altogether?  That would create the most jobs.  Oh, what's that Mr. Bush?  We actually have to pretend to allocate money for some of the things our government is doing?  Or even pay for them outright?  Wow.  So we can't just eliminate taxes in pursuit of jobs. Because we'll never actually pay for everything during a recession (especially with the tax cut-obsessed Republicans in charge), the argument therefore has two dimensions: how much we will appropriate or not ( i.e.,  give in tax cuts), and how much we will authorize ( i.e.  what programs we will fund or cut).  There are positive and negative values for each of these: greater amounts of taxes mean a greater ability to pay for what we do and a greater ability to fund programs, while less taxes means more capital is out in the economy.  More authorizations means we can pay for public goods like an up-to-date and satisfied military, international power projection, social security and other lesser-known programs.  But allocating less money to government programs allows for tax cuts that create all the jobs President Bush talks about.  The answer to a situation where there are benefits from taxing people and benefits from not taxing people, benefits from authorizing more programs and benefits from less government spending lies in a balance on both these axes based on specific economic and governmental goals.  I think the Bush Administration knows this and is trying to play Congress and the American people by focusing on the tax cut now, to stimulate the economy, regardless of programmatic funding demands.  Then, once a tax cut is passed President Bush will tell everybody, "hey look, there isn't enough money here to fund all of the programs the government currently runs.  So just fund the military and social security."  The Bush Administration isn't just looking at the country's economic woes, it is trying to shape the next battle, the one over the size of government.  Oh, just to give credit where credit is due: I thought about posting on this a few days ago, but was most immediately prompted by  urlLink this post  over at  urlLink reenhead .

         BAGHDAD'S WANNABE MAYOR ARRESTED   urlLink This guy  has been acting like the mayor of Baghdad for too long, pretending, or at least not discouraging rumors to the effect, that he was put in power by the Americans.  He was arming and uniforming his supporters.  People were re-registering for their jobs with him.  I'm glad the U.S.  urlLink finally arrested him  - apparently in the middle of a T.V. interview where he said he'd remain in power until a transititional government took over.  That was apparently too much.  His presumptuousness is of a kind with that of Ahmed Chalabi, the DOD's favorite returned Iraqi exile.  These guys will never be able to hold power and the fact that some in the U.S. support the Iraqi National Congress has unduly emboldened them to take things they do not deserve.  They are carpetbaggers, and hopefully this signals to Chalabi and the Iraqi people that the INC is  not  going to be put in charge by the United States.   WHAT TO DO ABOUT SHIITES?  Another thing I don't like are those who say that the Shiites' self-assertion in southern Iraq is a wonderful part of a new Iraqi religious and political pluralism. urlLink       That statement is not a lie, in itself.  But it is a dodge on the basic problem of what to do about that very large segment of Iraqi society who want a theocratic government.  They will not be able to get  that  exactly, but they may get something fundamentally less secular than what exists in many parts of the Arab world.  Najaf and Karbala are likely to be more like Teheran than Kuwait for a long time, and it's not clear how the U.S. will be able to temper the religious movements.  My thought is to try to take the best of what exists in Iran in order to prevent the worst of what exists in Iran.  Try to bring the clerics into a pluralistic political process without allowing them to  end  the political process.  How to do this: gerrymander Iraq by creating multi-member districts that allow moderates into power along with the Islamists.  Create districts and seats for tribal leaders to counteract the imams.  And show what cooperating with the United States can get them.  I would suggest a massive aid project for southern Iraq: recreate, as best as possible, the marsh ecosystem of Southern Iraq.  It will be ecologically friendly and employ southern Iraqis.  Just make sure we know who's in charge of the money so that it can't be siphoned off and given to the bad guys.   WHAT TO DO ABOUT NORTHERN IRAQ?  In contrast with southern Iraq, the problem is of  too little  ethnic/religious solidarity between peoples.   urlLink     Turkish special forces are smuggling weapons in to Turkmen in Kirkuk, who it says are being abused by Arabs and Kurds.  I don't get exactly what relationship exists between Turkmen and Turks, but obviously it is closer than that between Turks and Kurds or Arabs.  The tone of  urlLink this article  seems to suggest that the Turks are really in Kirkuk to stir up trouble than actually protect anyone, but it's hard to know what the case really is sitting at a desk here in Washington, D.C.  Where conflict  does  seem apparent and ugly is in Mosul, the other major northern city of mixed ethnicity, where it seems the thugs, gangsters and ethnic fighters are hard to distinguish from one another.  This reminds me of Johnny Adair and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, who were mixed up in crime as well as sectarian fighting.  I wonder if the U.S. shouldn't let the British deal with this situation because of that experience.  The U.S. has had trouble in Mosul because of its sponsorship of the Kurds and Mosul's favoring of Saddam.  Whoever is in charge, Mosul seems likely to be a locus of conflict for a while to come.  The common problem in both northern and southern Iraq seems to be insufficient numbers of police and a power vacuum due to the lack of clarity about the political status in cities and in Iraq overall.  Increased American troops may be necessary to ameliorate the solution, but I wonder if they can actually solve all of these problems satisfactorily.

         TACOMA POLICE CHIEF DIES IN ATTEMPTED MURDER-SUICIDE  Wow,  urlLink this story  is sad.  But I wonder if it is entirely surprising.  Cops are tough guys, many of them physical people.  To rise to the top in the police world probably requires a certain determination and an ability to control people.  I wonder if the same reasons David Brame became a cop and a police chief also led him to irreconcilable conflict with his wife and his final decision to attempt a murder-suicide.  Just another reminder that cops are just like the rest of us in too many ways.

         MAN ARE THESE GUYS IMPATIENT!  The war was relatively short; winning the peace is really the issue now.  We could knock out Saddam, but will we replace him with something better?  We may not have a long time to figure it out, if most Iraqis are as impatient as these guys.  Ah, to think back nostalgically to the Germans and the Japanese after World War II.  Does anybody remember  them  rioting in the streets to have everything they want now?  I don't think they did.  Oh, for a world with some patience.  But the big deal is that we have to do this well and leave a better result in place.  Remember the end of the Cold War?  We were successful in knocking off Communism.  But what replaced it?  Nothing that much better - crony capitalism, gangsters, crime, economic dislocation and a decline in living conditions in a number of formerly Communist states.  Not to mention ethnic wars.  If we are really going to win against terrorism, we have to show   That the values of the West (democracy, pluralism, meritocracy, free markets, etc.), as imposed by the U.S., can coexist with Sunni, Shiite and Arab culture . . . oh, and Kurdish culture as well. That the result of American forms is better than the life that the people of Iraq lived under Saddam. The transition from a totalitarian regime is always positive, the question is whether like the transition from Saddam will  also  have  negative  consequences, like those that happened in Russia or other parts of the Soviet Union.  We must work quickly to put positive changes into place and avoid negative ones.  It looks like we already made a big mistake in letting the looting of important parts of Baghdad (such as museums) take place and shooting into a stone-throwing crowd in Mosul.  Hopefully U.S. civilian and military leaders will be able to avoid such mistakes in the future.  Reconstruction after defeating an Arab dictatorship with ethnic/religious conflicts bubbling to the surface is a hard task.  However, it is an important one, one that probably only the United States could successfully undertake.  I hope that we can succeed.

         WELCOME TO THE FREEDOM AMERICANS ENJOY!  President Bush  urlLink recorded a message  for the Iraqi people the other day while visiting Northern Ireland to discuss Iraq with Tony Blair, who also recorded a similar message.  These have been described as condescending, talking about all the great freedoms  urlLink the gifted Iraqi people  will enjoy once they are thoroughly democratized and free to become good supply-siders.  Well, I've come up with a Bush message which would let the Iraqi people know they enjoy a freedom not often enjoyed by many Americans but cherished during those limited opportunities:  the God-given rights to riot and loot!    Good evening, my fellow Americans, er, Iraqis, er, . . . .  gifted Iraqi people .   I am sending you this message to inform you, if you have not already discovered, the great freedom you have been enjoying over the last few days - in particular in the cities of Mosul, Kirkuk, Basra, Najaf, and who could forget Baghdad.  You have been able to walk directly into government buildings and take tables, chairs and computers without anyone stopping you.  You have been able to steal farm machinery.  You have been able to harrass, shoot, and kill your neighbors without anyone stopping you.  You can rip off your local stores if you just have the manpower to do it.  You can even assault your own religious leaders with guns and knives and kill them!  You have your American saviors to thank for that freedom, a freedom that comes only rarely.   You see, in America we have this freedom only occasionally and have learned to cherish it.  It comes during the most memorable times in our history - for instance, when white people avoid going to jail for beating black people!   You may not have3 heard of this incident, but in the Los Angeles area, there was a major controversy when several white police officers beat Rodney King for resisting arrest.  This led to a trial watched by many after which the white police officers tried by a white jury were not convicted.  The result: a wonderful melee of destruction and looting!  White truck driver Reginald Denny was hauled from his truck in a riot-torn area, beaten and hit in the head with a brick!  Korean and other businesses were attacked, robbed and burned, as memoriably described in Sublime's   urlLink April 26, 1992  .  But I digress back to Daddy's time in office. . . . .    We have also had riots when people in America did not wish to be drafted to fight in our Civil War!  The New York Draft Riots, which killed a number of people, were recently joyously mis-depicted in the quasi-historical blockbuster  urlLink  Gangs of New York  , which starred Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz.  Hopefully your rioting will be as star-studded, memorable and moneymaking.  Be sure to dutifully record all the details so later filmmakers will be able to base a blockbuster upon the riots in your city, be it Basra, Mosul, Kirkuk or Baghdad. It appears some of you are already imitating the best of American cinema.  Taking a cue from the movie  urlLink  Three Kings  , I heard from Condi that some Iraqis were found  urlLink robbing a bank  during the post-war chaos.  Well done! There are numerous other uses for riots and looting, hopefully you will be able to discover some for yourself!  Thank you, and may God bless Iraq!

       urlLink     FIGHTING IN QAIM  In a part of the war less noticed than the collapse of Iraqi forces in Baghdad, Kirkuk, Mosul and other cities, U.S. and British special forces troops  urlLink are battling  more tenacious Iraqi Republican Guard and Special Security Organization troops at the Al Qaim base near the Syrian border.  A launching point for ballistic missile attacks against Israel in 1991 and a uranium processing plant, many speculate that the resistance is because members of Saddam's family or other regime officials are there,  urlLink or more likely  that some kind of weapons program or illegal weapons are being held there.  The U.S. says its forces  urlLink are gaining control  of the base.

         U.S. SPECIAL FORCES & KURDS TAKE KIRKUK  Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdish PUK have taken Kirkuk the way they have taken most of northern Iraq: after long periods of U.S. bombing, the Kurds were able to walk into the city  urlLink virtually without a fight .  The Iraqis retreated, back to Mosul, or more likely Tikrit.  The big deal of course is that the Turks said this city was not supposed to be taken by the Kurds.  The U.S. sent Colin Powell to Ankara recently, probably to massage the Turks into agreeing that the Kurds could go into the city under the coordination and control of U.S. Special Forces soldiers.  Abdullah Gul, Turkish foreign minister, said that the U.S. had given assurances that Kurdish forces would not remain in control of Kirkuk.  Turkey will be  urlLink sending military observers  to the city  I have a feeling the U.S. may have a little leeway in clearing the Peshmerga out of Kirkuk.  There has already been looting in the city and the U.S. and Kurdish forces will have to stem this.  In addition, there will be security problems if and when Kurds forced out of the city come back to the city to reclaim their homes and settle old scores.  The U.S. can take on these problems itself, but it will be easier if the Kurdish forces now in the city cooperate in taking care of the problem.  Once things settle down, the Peshmerga can be moved out of the city proper and defend it.   urlLink Regular U.S. soldiers  and people now inside the city (not just Kurds) can probably take care of internal security then.  The big decision now is whether the U.S. forces will move south to engage forces surrounding Tikrit or go on to Mosul, which they probably can take without much more difficulty than Kirkuk?  The U.S. will have to spend considerable time mopping up around Baghdad - it is a huge city, but if Saddam is not captured or killed during those operations, there will be a strong push to take out those in Tikrit.

         UN ROLE IN IRAQ  I'm looking into the different proposals for a UN role in Iraq, which the Wolfowitz-types oppose.  According to the BBC, President Bush has said that there is a  urlLink false choice  being created regarding who will run Iraq after the war - coalition forces or the UN.  Bush says the Iraqi people will govern their country.  Well, that's very nice to say, but I doubt he means to allow the country to descend into looting and violence urlLink  like that in Basra   now that the British have removed the fedayeen.  Somehow, order will have to be established, and that will not be done by "the Iraqis."  It will be done  on their behalf , no doubt, but not by the Iraqis.  The people will have to be fed, and this will not be done by Iraqis.  A governance arrangement will have to be made, and this will not happen of its own accord.  The UN could add some credibility in the world's eyes.  This is probably because of the distaste the Bush Administration and conservatives have for the UN.  I mean, last night Bob Novak was saying that allowing the UN to run things was the same as letting France run things.  Now that's complete B.S., but conservatives buy into that.  Here's my take: the UN should be able to do some things within its expertise.  But for all my love of the UN, it may be a good time to teach the UN a lesson.  If the US is involved in a conflict and the UN can't do as good a job at solving a particular problem as the US can, tough luck UN.  Make the UN compete for work and learn that not being effective will only get them excluded from reconstruction efforts.  I think the UN needs to really be focused on humanitarian efforts and reconstruction aid and stay away from the political parts of this reconstruction effort.  UN involvement may be useful in the political realm if it is facilitative of a good choice of a national leader, but, as was the case in Afghanistan, the locals, coached by the U.S., need to make the choices if the U.S. going to have to back up this new regime.  I'll reconsider my support of U.S. control of governance, defense, policing and other similar issues if the U.S. tries to install Ahmed Chalabi as the leader of a free Iraq.  That guy is a useless blowhard with no local support.  If he's put in power, it will only create instability in the country and he'll be gone within a few years, if not months.  What the country needs is local leadership, from among the people who've suffered under Saddam.

         CHEMICAL WEAPONS FIND  Early evidence indicates that chemical weapons have been found at a military base in Hindiya, near Karbala.  Testing takes time and is not always conclusive, so the find is not being reported as definite.  Secretary of Defense Don  urlLink Rumsfeld has downplayed the initial reports , saying they are often wrong. [Rumsfeld did, however, say  urlLink that he believed  'Chemical' Ali Majid to be dead]  According to  urlLink this story  in the New York Times, soldiers in a camp there came across an unusually large number of chemical suits and investigated, finding a riot control gas, CN.  This made a few soldiers sick and several people, including Knight-Ridder reporter Tom Lasseter, were decontaminated.  After testing the contents of one 20-gallon container, tests indicated that  urlLink sarin  and  urlLink tabun  were inside.  Tests on another 55-gallon drum apparently found mustard gas inside.   urlLink MSNBC says  the container with sarin and tabun may also contain  urlLink lewisite , a blister agent.  NBC's Dana Lewis says one of the discoveries is at a military camp and another at a pesticide factory.  NPR quotes a top official with the 1st Marine Division as saying  urlLink Marines had discovered BM-21 missiles  equipped with sarin and mustard gas ready to be used.   urlLink ABC News' John McWethy  said site exploration teams are testing missile warheads armed with sarin at one site, and that a blister agent had been found at another site.  Reuters' Kieran Murray quotes Major Michael Hamlet of the 101st Airborne as saying that the alleged sarin and tabun finds at a camp and an agricultural site (does this contradict the pesticide plant story?) in the town of Albu Mahawish  urlLink could turn out to merely be pesticides .  Another officer says that the 14 barrels, 3 55-gallon drums and 11 25-gallon barrels, appear to have a cocktail of chemical weapons.  The Washington Post says that the 14 barrels discovered by a 101st Airborne Division patrol likely contain sarin, tabun  urlLink and the blistering agent phosgene  (contradicting MSNBC's claim that it is lewisite, unless the two names are synonymous).  Fox News cites Pentagon sources as saying that a  urlLink POW tipped the Americans  to the site of the alleged weapons find.  AFP quotes Marine intelligence officer Captain Adam Mastrianni as saying that the materials found  were  in fact  urlLink merely pesticides , then later it seems they back away from this flat refutation.

         PAGING MR. POWELL, PAGING MR. POWELL   "Paging Mr. Herman, paging Mr. Herman..." went the line in   urlLink Pee-Wee's Big Adventure  .  After all we've heard from Don Rumsfeld and  urlLink Paul Wolfowitz , you wonder where Powell's been exiled to.  Rumsfeld is talking about  urlLink threatening Iran, Syria  and others with Iraq's fate.  Wolfowitz is talking about how the U.S. is going to run the occupation of Iraq: not much more than 6 months of occupation.  With help from U.S. forces as initial governors, the Iraqi opposition would lead a transition away from Saddam's regime without any interference from the UN.  The neoconservatives are in charge and running things their way.  I don't see things turning out their way.  I think the U.S. will have to undertake a serious occupation of Iraq and won't be able to move on for several years.  The question used to be whether the U.S. could fight wars on two fronts at once.  I think there's a new question of a neoconservative era.  With the U.S. projecting its power all over the globe, how many places in the world can the U.S. keep the peace or build nations while maintaining a credible threat to attack the other bad guys.  If the U.S. military has to maintain homeland security, do peacekeeping in the Balkans, play federal marshal in Afghanistan, and create a believeable democracy in Iraq, can it believeably threaten everyone else?  And how long can the U.S. sustain the costs necessary to implement the neoconservative strategy?  I don't think any amount of time is really long enough; eventually those costs will be unsustainable and so will this kind of policy.  That's why we need Powell back in town.  We need somebody to counter the intemperate Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz the true believer.

        JOY AND PAIN  I haven't been able to post that much this week.  I've been trying to write  two  briefs for a WTO Moot Court competition I probably never should have gotten mixed up in.  I spent a period from 6:45am Tuesday until 2:00pm or so Thursday awake, most of the time working on these briefs.  In the end we turned in our briefs late, losing points and probably hurting our chances immensely.  We compete on April 14th.  Being done with the brief was a great load off my chest; despite the imperfections and lateness of our brief, I was happy to have worked hard at this and done the best I could.  The weather here has turned to Spring; the day I turned in the brief I walked home up the hill from Georgetown's main campus having not slept for 54 hours or so.  The magnolias and cherry trees are all blooming, everyone's flower gardens are full of color, a nice breeze was blowing.  I realized that with the pain of life comes a great amount of happiness.  My girlfriend came in later that day and I was able to spend some time with her and some old friends Friday night.  I have more back work to do than I can believe, I'm still looking for a job, and I'm trying to spend the weekend with my girlfriend.  Joy and pain and joy again.

         SADDAM ALIVE?  Saddam is shown walking through a neighborhood above. I would guess that he is still alive. I would think that if he was dead things would have been less organized. Video speech of him could have been faked, but my instinct from listening to him speak on the video of him was that it was him. Saddam says on the video, "you might remember that the iraqi peasants dropped the apache with his own rifle". Is this proof that he is still alive? Well I doubt he would have made a video of himself saying random stuff like that, so I would guess he is still alive.

           THE BOMB SPOTTER  Reuters correspondent Mike Collett-White is the guy I always look up when on google news in order to find out good information about the bombing in northern Iraq.  I think he must be right up on the front lines.  It appears, in poking around on the web, that he's been a few a few other places in Southwestern or Central Asia, like Almaty, New Delhi, in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, as well as that other very dangerous city, London.  Well, thanks for sticking your neck out so I can read all about the bombing near Kirkuk and the shelling of Chamchamal, etc.

       PERU WANTS TO JOIN CONSULTATIONS ON GMO PRODUCTS IN WTO DISPUTE  Below is Peru's request to join the consultations on GMOs between the U.S. and the EC.  Peru had been on U.S.'s list of Members that would participate as third parties - does this change anything?  I can't remember if third parties can join consultations, but I believe it may be possible.  In order to file a complaint, I believe strictly bilateral consultations are required.  But I'm just going on what I think, not what I know.  While the message is brief, it is interesting that Peru mentions only interests in violations of the Ag Agreement, the SPS and TBT - Peru says nothing about violations of GATT itself.  I wonder if that has any effect on a request to join consultations?  In some overly formalistic world it might, but I doubt it would here, especially where there is a reference to the American request for consultations, which complained of GATT violations.       WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION     WT/DS291/1   27 May 2003 (03-2849) Original: English       EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES - MEASURES AFFECTING THE APPROVAL  AND MARKETING OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS     Request to Join Consultations    Communication from Peru

       KIRKUK ON FRONTLINE   urlLink Frontline  comes through again.  This story is the best description of what happened in the days surrounding the capture of Kirkuk by Kurds - the weak Iraqi resistance, the ethnic conflict on Kurdish reentry into the city, etc.  I have a lot of respect now for the U.S. Special Forces who went into the city to try to defuse the tensions in the city.  In an interesting story, the city has elected a mayor and deputies.  The election was undertaken by  urlLink 300 electors  chosen by the U.S., so it doesn't seem like a model democracy.  However, I could imagine the spectacle of a full-blown election would be an occasion for ethnic division and violence.  I wonder if anyone gave the U.S. forces on the ground in Kirkuk any advice on how to have an election without promoting the type of ethnic division we had in the Balkans.  Have we learned anything from trying to rebuild Bosnia?

       HUEY P. CHAVEZ  Just saw a PBS piece on Huey Long.  How he ruled the state of Louisiana with an increasingly tyrannical bent until he was shot.  What was his goal?  His Share the Wealth campaign was distribution from the rich to the poor in a very simple way.  His enemies were militant; Long, a U.S. Senator, basically had an army of state troopers.  Reminds me a lot of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.  Chavez is a power-accumulating President with a genuine concern for the masses, but his enemies are militantly against him.  It seems that their personalities are somewhat different, however.  Which makes me think that the similarities we see are worthy of a real political science analysis.  My quick and dirty analysis: in both cases we see a dilemma of democracy.  Democracy brings to power those with a great will and great ability to serve the people.  You always see near-pathological seekers of one version or another of the public good.  Why do these people work to take power?  Because they crave not personal wealth but popular adulation and the sense of greatness for having done much for many people.  They have a sense they can do great things.  They are an odd breed of megalomaniacs.  However, the diffusion of power in a democracy makes it difficult for leaders to enact positive legislation that  counters powerful interests.  Because of this difficulty, the leader, wishing to accomplish his goals and serve the people, has a strong temptation to consolidate power in himself (or herself) serve the public good (as he/she sees it).   This is especially the case in times like the Depression (Long) or the economic hardship of the Third World (Chavez).  Trying to take on entrenched interests and marginalizing the other side of political disputes provokes militancy and creates emergencies.  In that type of situation, it is no surprise that Chavez was briefly ousted and his opposition keeps trying to depose him.  In Long's day, his opponents wished him dead and clashed with his forces (this is in the United States, people!).  He feared assassination for years and was eventually killed.  Long was killed, so we can't predict outcomes perfectly.  But most guessed that he would have created a third wave of politics based on his share-the-wealth concepts - straight-up distributionalism.  He was running for president.  His share-the-wealth ideas could have really been popular in the Depression, but I fear it would have led to economic disaster and then a vicious circle in which the poor get poorer and thus demand more of the remaining rich.  A power-hungry person like Long would have preyed on this situation to get more and more power, and this could have seriously damaged the United States' society, Constitution, and economy.  I think that Chavez will survive in Venezuela.  The question is whether he will allow himself to be voted out of office.  I think that, Chavez, facing stiff opposition and military forces arrayed against him, will eventually be forced to play democratically, though as Long showed, there are a lot of ways to mess with democracy.  I think Chavez will decline once he loses the Presidency.  The problem is really what he does to try to constitutionally entrench the changes he wants made and what power he draws to himself in order to get what he wants during his interval as President of Venezuela.  He could damage the constitutional order of the country and create another Colombia.

      Gus Van Sant  urlLink wins Palm d'Or  at Cannes for his movie  Elephant , an improvised movie mirroring the Columbine shootings.  My first thoughts:   French people love something that indicates the moral decay/failure of America.  They got it here.  Columbine wasn't about how America failed blacks or other minorities, it was about how America has failed to deal with the problems of intelligent middle-class white male teenagers.  It indicates that rather than having some spots on the apple, the apple has problems at its core.  And the French love it.  What's French for Schadenfreude? The improvisation probably works better with an audience that gets subtitles and doesn't have to understand the way the kids deliver their made-up lines.  In English the movie may not seem half as good.  I don't know. And what makes this film like  Pulp Fiction , the last American winner at Cannes?  It's popular, but the style is unique, sort of avant-garde.  That's just my thought.  I'm not a film buff, I just wish I had the time.

       FEAR OF FRANKENFISH  Being from Washington and interested in the GMO dispute, I couldn't resist  urlLink this story .  The article argues that Northwest fishermen and wild fish providers stand to gain when public revulsion against genetically modified salmon used by fish farmers, first in Europe and then in the U.S., causes them to turn away from farm fish.  That might happen in Europe, where GMOs are an issue people know about and it changes consumer behavior, but in my opinion, no one in the U.S. cares (outside of Nader voters).  Nobody who hasn't grown up eating salmon all their life knows the difference between farm salmon and wild salmon anyway.    The story is also somewhat hypothetical, as genetically modified salmon won't exist for a few years - at least until after a panel and Appellate Body decision are made in the GMO case.  The result of that case may harden European attitudes against GMOs, but I have a feeling that no one in the U.S. will care until some disaster strikes.  The disaster will also have to happen to humans, not a butterfly extinction or some other remote ecological problem.  And that, I think, would take genetic modifications that aren't yet possible.

       THE IRANIAN CONNECTION  The big story of the day seems to be the cutting of diplomatic ties and changes in strategy toward Iran.  The U.S. is planning on destabilizing the country and foment unrest to overthrow the country.  This is a bad move.  It will help entrench conservative forces there and undermine those who would reach out to us.  Now I can understand cutting diplomatic ties, the attacks were egregious.  But the real issue is what to do to weaken the hard-liners who harbor and support Al Qaeda.  The big-picture answer, unfortunately for the impatient Bushies, is still the Cuban answer: engagement with liberals and forcing the hardliners into irrelevance.  But, short-term, I wouldn't be against a few quiet assassinations of bad guys who are supporting terror and Al Qaeda operatives.  Enough to deter the bad guys and make them feel unsafe doing what they're doing.  But you're dreaming if you think we're going to be able to start a rebellion in Iran or improve the situation by invading the country.  What I wonder is whether the Bush guys are trying to prove that their cockamamy Axis of Evil strategy is right by changing the facts on the ground - if we take out the bad guys in charge in Iraq and Iran and run those countries, Bush guys will be able to say, "we acted when we saw a threat and we're better off safe than sorry."  Nobody will be able to say hostile engagement was a bad idea, they'll just be "speculating" the Bush people will say.  And we'll never learn if there was an alternative to the neo-con approach.

       WHEN WATCHING TV IN ENGLISH OVERTAXES YOUR MIND . . .  I've been watching  Univision .  Watching TV you aren't supposed to understand is a pretty good release.  Then there's the gratuitously underclad dancing women everywhere.  I had to laugh when I saw the commercial for the car dealer where  "su trabajo es su credito."   I guess some things are the same in every language.  Do you think there are Nigerian scam e-mails in Spanish?

       BLAIR PLAYS THE RACE CARD  I remember Juan Williams getting rather angry on Fox News Sunday a few weeks ago about people who said the Jayson Blair story was about race.  He said those who did so were just trying to use the Blair story to push their ideological agendas.  That's true, I thought, there are a lot of cynical people out there who can't just see this as the story of a coked-out alcoholic manic-depressive liar who happened to self-destruct at the New York Times.  And who also happened to be black.  But no,  urlLink it seems the truly cynical manipulator in this tale is Jayson Blair himself .  He is planning a book entitled  Burning Down My Master's House , in which he paints himself as the black victim of white institutions from his second-grade teacher to the New York Times, a drug-runner from the streets whose lying and plagiarizing habits were his way of sticking it to the man.  Blair portrays himself this way despite growing up middle class; he grew up in Centreville, Virginia (the D.C. suburbs) and his father is now Inspector General of the Smithsonian Institution.  Something about Blair's account of himself just doesn't sit well with me.  It seems like he's still lying and making excuses for his actions rather than admitting his guilt and trying to make amends.  The fact that Blair doesn't accept primary blame for his failures makes me doubt his account more generally.    But I understand why Blair has to write this book and make his millions.  He'll never find another employer willing to put him in a position of trust.   . . . . At least for a while.  But this is America, the land of second chances.  And unfortunately this may not be the last we hear of Jayson Blair.

       THE LESSON OF SARS: DON'T EAT WEIRD ANIMALS  Discovery of SARS in civet cats in Southern China indicates that  urlLink the disease probably spread to humans from those animals .  Or maybe racoon dogs or Chinese ferret badgers.  All very exotic animals, even in Southern China.  While I'll eat a lot of things others won't, I'm not sure I'd want to try any of those critters.  In my lazy rambling around the Internet I found an old BBC story about animals available as food in southern China [ cobras, turtles, dogs, civets, pangolins, owls . . .] and people's attitudes about eating them.   urlLink The article  says many think that:  "If it flies in the air or walks on the land then it must be good to eat." If there's any lesson that comes out of the SARS story as regards transmission of diseases from animals to humans, it is how  wrong  that old Chinese saying really is.  And the problem isn't just in the eating, it's in preparing animals as food and handling these animals while live.  Just having wild animals like these around is probably a bad idea.  Of course, ordinary super-domesticated animals  can  carry undiscovered diseases as well, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Mad Cow Disease).  It just seems that normally, we understand diseases of domesticated animals better than those of wild animals and thus they are probably safer to eat.

       RATCHETING UP THE RHETORIC IN GMO DISPUTE  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick had  urlLink an Op-Ed  in the May 21 Wall Street Journal on the GMO dispute entitled "United States v. European Union."  None too subtle.  But the part I found most interesting about the Op-Ed was USTR's answer to the "why now?" question.  The Administration believes that the Europeans will put off removing the moratorium indefinitely and has gotten sick and tired of the "just wait a little bit longer . . . " response it always gets on GMO issues from the EC.  The Administration, in addition to domestic political reasons, wants to take up this dispute now to create a decision-forcing situation for the EC.  Unfortunately, it seems to me that the decision is likely to be "NON!" in response to U.S. pressure.  I hate to be pessimistic, but I think we will be stuck in a situation like that after  Hormones .  The measures won't be rescinded and the institutional relevance of the WTO will be harmed.   Zoellick also  urlLink told the House Committee on on Agriculture  on Wednesday that the Administration wants to expand market access, remove export subsidies and export monopolies, and a $100 billion lowering of domestic agricultural supports to "level the playing field."  Basically, Zoellick is admitting that the U.S. has high agricultural supports, but saying that the EU and Japan should bring their subsidies down to U.S. levels.  Good luck, Mr. Zoellick.     urlLink On the other side of the Atlantic , lawmakers in the European Parliament have decided to lower tolerances for traces of GMOs in non-GMO products from 0.9% to 0.5%.  The European Commission condemned the decision.  This doesn't exactly help the Commission's case before the WTO because such low amounts of GMOs cannot be accurately verified.  That means the law allows for either cheating by exporters to the EC or regulations excluding products with a possible 0.5% GMO content, whether or not that can be proven, or both.  And because of the spiteful nature of the EU action, the U.S., Canada, Argentina (and Egypt) can easily walk away from consultations without having thought of any way to settle this dispute besides WTO litigation that will stiffen both sides' resolve and make them not want to end the dispute.  The big problem is that a rancorous dispute like this over agricultural issues will make it much less likely that anything will come of the Doha Round agricultural negotiations.  I think filing this case now is an indication that the U.S. believes the EC is not going to make significant concessions on agriculture in the Doha Round negotiations.  I thought this might be an attempt to horse-trade with the EC regarding Doha: make serious concessions regarding agriculture and we'll drop the case.  But that's politically unrealistic.  U.S. agricultural companies and farming states want the U.S. to go all the way and win the case and such a challenge will stiffen EU public will against any serious agricultural concessions.

       BUSH: GMOs TO HALT AFRICAN HUNGER  President Bush has gone on the offensive on GMOs and European agricultural subsidies.  Bush tied these issues to development and food-related needs, especially in Africa.  Though the Initiative to End Hunger that Bush is proposing (see below) may sound new, it's not - the Initiative has been around since at least August 2002, when it was  urlLink outlined  by USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa.  He addressed these issues in a commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy, saying: " When I travel to Europe next week, I will challenge our allies to make a similar commitment which will save even more lives. I will remind them that the clock is ticking -- that every single day 8,000 more people will die from AIDS in Africa. There will be 14,000 more infections. I will urge our European partners, and Japan, and Canada, to join a great mission of rescue, and to match their good intentions with real resources. (Applause.)  The advance of freedom and hope in the world is also challenged by an ancient enemy: famine. Our world produces more than enough food to feed its 6 billion people. Yet tens of millions are at risk of starvation, and millions more lack water fit for drinking. This crisis also is concentrated in Africa. We have the ability to confront this suffering. And we accept the duty, as old as the Scriptures, to comfort the afflicted and to feed the hungry.  America is already the largest provider in the world of food relief -- giving more than $1.4 billion in global emergency food aid, and one-half of all contributions to the World Food Program. And we are determined to do more. I've committed to a nearly $1 billion initiative to provide clean drinking water to 50 million people in the developing world. I've also asked Congress to provide $200 million for a new Famine Fund, which will give us the flexibility to act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. I call on other nations to follow our lead by establishing their own emergency funds. By saving time in responding to crisis, we will save lives.  We can also greatly reduce the long-term problem of hunger in Africa by applying the latest developments of science. I have proposed an Initiative to End Hunger in Africa. By widening the use of new high-yield bio-crops and unleashing the power of markets, we can dramatically increase agricultural productivity and feed more people across the continent.   Yet, our partners in Europe are impeding this effort. They have blocked all new bio-crops because of unfounded, unscientific fears. This has caused many African nations to avoid investing in biotechnologies, for fear their products will be shut out of European markets. European governments should join -- not hinder -- the great cause of ending hunger in Africa . (Applause.)   We must also give farmers in Africa, Latin America and Asia and elsewhere a fair chance to compete in world markets. When wealthy nations subsidize their agricultural exports, it prevents poor countries from developing their own agricultural sectors. So I propose that all developed nations, including our partners in Europe, immediately eliminate subsidies on agricultural exports to developing countries so that they can produce more food to export and more food to feed their own people." (Applause.) The full text of his speech can be found  urlLink here .    UPDATE:  Friends of the Earth  urlLink doesn't like  the Bush Administration's use of hunger in Africa as a reason for countries to accept GMO crops.  Well that's surprising.

       WHY IS HERBERT "H-DOG" KORNFELD SO FUNNY?  The latest from editor-at-large Herbert Kornfeld is in this week's edition of  urlLink The Onion .  H-Dog and tha Accountz Receevin' bruthaz rescue one a they own from the weak-ass shiznit that is jury duty.  Sort of.  I've always enjoyed H-Dog, but I sometimes feel a bit guilty about it.  You see, pretty much the whole reason why H-Dog is funny is that he speaks and writes in an over-the-top ebonic/street/gangsta slang even though he's a white, probably Jewish, accountant at an office supply company.  So does thinking the way he talks is funny mean that I think the way black people talk is worthy of ridicule?  It could be said that H-Dog is really funny because he's some white guy pretending to be black who is making us laugh at  him  because he's so nerdy and his wannabe gangster antics are hilarious.  Sort of like Jamie Kennedy in  urlLink Malibu's Most Wanted  (though I'm just guessing, I haven't seen it).  It's also arguable that it's funny because it shows how odd it sounds when white people start talking as if they're black.  This happens all the time - white Americans have been picking up things from the way African-Americans speak for a long time, and many whites consider blacks the arbiters of "coolness" and imitate what they find cool about black people.  This leads to odd situations where bland, ordinary white people with names like Herbert Kornfeld end up speaking a mish-mash of ebonics and standard English straight off the 6 o'clock news.  Trying to absorb the black culture white America looks to for style tips, white Americans just seem ridiculous.  But, if you really think about it, H-Dog is funny to white people at least in part because of a contradiction in white culture: we absorb and ape black culture and think black culture is ridiculous at the same time.  White people think high-fiving your buddy and saying "what up, dog" is simultaneously cool and stupid.  And that is a reflection, I believe, of a stereotype white people have regarding black people more generally.  They consider them cool but don't really respect them, their culture, their mannerisms or their speech, in particular.   And that is why, at least to some degree, I think I am right to feel guilty that I find Herbert "H-Dog" Kornfeld so funny.

       BUSH WANTS GUN CONTROL . . . . FOR IRAQ   urlLink This story  in the  New York Times  says the U.S. is going to take away Iraqis' guns.  Oh no, John Lott!  Do people in the U.S. military and the Bush Administration think that Iraqis having guns is a bad thing?  Maybe even dangerous?  To quote the  Times : "The intention is to reduce attacks against allied forces, reduce crime and stop violent fights among rival Iraqi groups, allied commanders believe."   Do these justifications hold true in the United States?  Do we want to stop attacks on police, reduce crime and stop violent fights between rival gangs in the U.S.?  Maybe we should do what the U.S. is doing in Iraq.  The U.S. is letting people keep some guns in order to defend their homes, which may comfort NRA types, but because Iraqis don't have a Second Amendment to bludgeon anti-gun regulations into submission, the U.S. gets to set sensible limitations on gun ownership for Iraqis.  If we could only have the same rights as the "free" people of Iraq.

       NATO PLANS TO GET KARADZIC BY NEXT YEAR?  That's what  urlLink this  Reuters  article  seems to say.  The EU is hinting that it could take over the Bosnia peacekeeping mission from SFOR by next year.  Such a handover seems to amount to an American pullout from Bosnia.   While the American commander of SFOR, General William Ward, has said that he does not know if SFOR will be replaced next year, he says that there are tasks he wants to accomplish before NATO hands responsibility over to the EU, including the capture of Karadzic and Mladic.  These captures seem like a benchmark for accomplishment the U.S. can use to justify a pullout.   Based on troop needs in Afghanistan and especially Iraq and a U.S. presence in Kosovo, leaving Bosnia in the hands of the EU would probably benefit the U.S.  This could be a good route to some reconciliation on the military cooperation level because the EU's core states, France and Germany, aren't interested in helping the U.S. militarily in Iraq.  So I would bet the EC will take over after the U.S. and NATO capture Karadzic and maybe Mladic.    SFOR troops should have free access (though they'll face local opposition) to capture of Karadzic in Republika Srpska.  Karadzic would probably get more support in Srpska than in neighboring Montenegro (where he may also be hiding) but SFOR doesn't have a mandate to go into Montenegro . . . Or Serbia for that matter, where Mladic is supposed to be living.  So capture of these two probably won't just involve a military attack but a lot of difficult negotiating with Montenegro and Serbia.

       COMPARISON OF THE CANADIAN AND AMERICAN REQUESTS FOR CONSULTATIONS    The Canadian request does not put the measures taken by EC members into different categories like the U.S. request. The Canadian request, as it does not have an attached list of measures about which Canada is complaining (a big difference), mentions several EC members specifically. The U.S. and Canadian requests both claim violation of the same articles of the GATT, SPS, TBT, and Agreement on Agriculture. The Canadian claim, however, cites specific paragraphs of the articles, like Articles 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5 of the SPS Agreement, which may be limiting - though I can't see how, as whatever you put in your complaint is what is supposed to matter - I think). Basically, the two requests are  very  similar, functionally identical.

       More about the GMO Dispute:   urlLink Here  is a  urlLink  Financial Times  article  about the GMO dispute the U.S. is taking to the WTO.  The best point of the article: the worst thing that could happen in this case is that the U.S. could win.  That would politically set the EC against accommodating GMO foods, when doing nothing about the dispute (while frustrating) would eventually lead to changes in EC policy.  It looks like, just like in the case of the steel safeguard, the Bush Administration is caving to domestic industry for political gain.  So let me get this straight: the Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility  and  free trade?  Wow.

       AL QAEDA RESURGENT?  There was a series of bombings in Casablanca tonight.  There have been threats of attacks in East Africa, including very specific ones against British Airways apparently.  Is the recent "wave" of terror a sign that Al Qaeda is back to full strength?  Is it an attempt to show that they aren't as down-and-out as the U.S. and its allies claim?  Probably some of both.  I think what we're seeing now is an Al Qaeda that has decided to go on, boldly, with attacks even knowing that it faces greater risks.  If the U.S. has upped the stakes, Al Qaeda has decided to go all-in, not backing down when challenged.  I think Al Qaeda has gotten past fear of post-September 11 American antiterrorist efforts because they realize that the U.S. can't stop everything.  So what if the U.S. is chasing them?  Run long enough to get an attack off and it's worth it.  The $64,000 Question is whether Al Qaeda have been able to effectively coordinate the timing of these attacks (or threats) across North Africa, the Middle East and East Africa.  That would imply a boldness, a level of organization and a feeling of freedom to communicate that is surprising after all the recent U.S. successes against Al Qaeda.

       THOUGHTS ON  MATRIX RELOADED : In Progress Big Time Spoilers, of course    I'm confused: did I see the video game or the movie?  There was a lot of action in the original  Matrix , but the kung fu sequences seemed a bit too long this time.  It exemplified a lot about the movie.  The filmmakers were too caught up showing off to give us a solid plot.  I mean, I wanted to know a  lot  more about Smith.  For such a major character, who seems to have made such a major change, we learn very little. I think the moviemakers may have avoided giving up any plot because they were trying so hard to play up the intriguing mysteries we saw in the first movie.  Trying to sort the truth from the lies  was  interesting, but I wanted more plot development. The worst part: how long could the credits  possibly  be?  I waited around  forever  for the long-promised  Matrix Revolutions  trailer.  QUESTIONS I HAVE:   How did Neo kill the Sentinels?  This could either be  the  mystery and the key to everything or just an interesting sidenote.  How did Neo know the Sentinels were using a new tool, a bomb?  Did he just figure it out or did he  know  somehow that they were doing this? This could indicate that: * The supposed "real world" in which Morpheus, Neo,  et al.  live in is just another circle of hell, and Neo can manipulate that world like the Matrix.  There are a number of problems with this theory.  First is the way that killing the Sentinel (messing with the laws of physics as he did in the Matrix) harmed Neo in a way that never happened in the Matrix.  He's in a coma at the end of the movie. * There is the "connection" Neo feels with the Sentinels, which parallels the "connection" he has with Smith in a way that cannot be a coincidence. I don't remember - was the guy on the other side of the table from Neo a Smith clone or another Agent on Smith's team? Are there really any programs on the human side or are they all just serving a purpose like the Keymaker was?  The Matrix Reloaded trailer showed a quick clip of the Oracle's white-coated guard program, who  did  seem to be one of the good guys. At the end, when Neo is speeding along to catch  Trinity, he chews up everything around him.  I realized that all the cars flying around and the buildings falling apart probably had people in them, ordinary human people.  Who were dying.  Then I thought about the highway fight, which turned into on huge traffic disaster.  Do Neo & Co. think it's OK to kill hundreds of people so they can save one, like Trinity?  There is of course the love story, but they seem to do this all the time.  Do they consider their mission so important that it is OK to let so many people get killed?

       WAS DEAN'S HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT GOOD?  I haven't read Howard Dean's health care plan.  Since it hasn't been released, I haven't read Kerry's either.  But now that Dean's plan beat Kerry's to press and got relatively good . . . press, Kerry has called off his big health care plan announcement.  Maybe somebody with Kerry didn't want to make it seem like he thinks his big competition is Dean.  Maybe Kerry's people looked into their hearts and realized their plan ain't that great.  Maybe Kerry's people were afraid of getting slapped silly by Dr. Dean if their plan didn't measure up.  Maybe he was actually afraid to miss voting "no" on the tax cut.  I don't know.  But I do care.  The primary game is definitely interesting when there are so many candidates.  The "health care plan" theme that emerged once Gephardt put out his plan seems to have shaped the debate.  Now everyone has to put out a plan it in order to prove their seriousness.  I can't wait to see the Sharpton health care plan.

       I MISSED THE MATRIX PREMIERE!  Tried to go see  urlLink Matrix Reloaded  today.  Made the mistake of going to buy my ticket for a show at either  10:00, 10:30, 11:00, or 11:20pm  at 3:30 this afternoon.  Only 6 1 / 2  hours in advance - big mistake.  So I missed the show tonight.  Single tear sliding down my left cheek . . . .   Showtimes for tomorrow:  10:00pm, 10:30, 11:25, 12:35pm, 1:10, 1:45, 2:40, 3:15, 3:50, 4:25, 5:00, 5:55, 6:30, 7:05, 7:40, 9:10, 9:45, 10:20, 10:55pm  Hopefully I'll be able to get a ticket for one of those.  The worst part about not seeing it is that the world is awash in Matrix information.  Slate  urlLink has a review  full of spoilers, there are trailers all over the place,  urlLink  Charlie Rose   had Joel Silver, Larry Fishburne (yes, I call him Larry), Carrie-Ann Moss, and his Keanu-ness on, giving away way too much about the movie.  Guess who said "it's all about a collective of shall I say it? . . .  love ?"  I had to change the channel.  Normal people may not need an excuse like the vacuity of Keanu Reeves to change the channel away from Charlie Rose, but I'm a PBS-aholic.  Can't get enough of the stuff.   Man I need cable . . . .

      I've been reading posts (some links to relevant OxBlog posts  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) about the need for Democrats to develop of a foreign policy alternative to what the Bush Administration is doing.  I think a Democratic foreign policy has to:    Explain why collective security is better than unilateralism (generally). Respond to the problem of asymmetric warfare against the United States (including terrorism).  This is  the  short- to mid-term security problem for the United States.  The U.S.'s potential relative decline from its current hegemonic position is the long-term problem, but given the  urlLink political difficulty of saying this , let's leave that discussion for later.  Charlie Rose had a link to Amazon's page for  urlLink Terror and Liberalism  by Paul Berman.  Sounds good. Give justifications for foreign intervention that differ from those of Bush or other Republicans.  Or give a good reason for non-intervention. This checklist isn't complete, just a few things I think need to be covered.  As for foreign economic policy, I think there is a lot of freedom among Democrats to disagree.  Some are total free-traders while others are more pro-labor and others were probably at the barricades in Seattle.  While it's important, let's stick to foreign security policy.

         SECOND CHECHNYA BOMBING  A female suicide bomber  urlLink set off a bomb  in a large crowd at a Muslim religious festival in Iliskhan Yurt, a village near Guidermes, Chechnya.  At least 20 were killed and several others injured.  What's the connection between this bombing and that of yesterday?  The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says it could have been an attempt to kill the leader of the pro-Moscow regional government, Akhmad Kadyrov.  Monday's bombing attack destroyed a regional government building.  So the strong inference is that someone wants to threaten or destroy the new Chechnyan regional government.  The use of suicide bombers makes one think of militant Islamic terrorism and that is probably a reasonable conclusion.  However, because Chechnya's separatists are radicalized Muslims, it is hard to separate the two causes locally.  However, because the targets are clearly of such local significance, I would not say that Al Qaeda is involved.  I found it odd at first that the attack would come at a Muslim festival, but if the separatists thought they could get Akhmad Kadyrov there, they'd probably take their chance.

          WAS CHECHNYA BOMBING ALSO AL QAEDA?  President Putin urlLink  told NATO Secretary General George Robertson  that the bombing attack in northern Chechnya overnight  urlLink "bear[s] the same imprint"  as the attacks in Saudi Arabia, much like Colin Powell said the Riyadh attacks bear the "earmarks" of Al Qaeda.  Why would Putin say that?  The attack, unlike that in Saudi Arabia, seems to be strictly related to the conflict in Chechnya -  urlLink the building attacked  was a regional government building containing FSB and Interior Ministry offices.  The attack was clearly meant to target local pro-Russian elements.  The vehicle used was a large truck, not multiple vehicles as used in Saudi Arabia, very similar to a December attack.  The only commonalities seems to be timing - the attacks took place on the same day.  A tenuous tie could be the fact that members of the cell that probably carried out the bombing in Saudi Arabia had fought in Chechnya, but factually they are likely unrelated.   urlLink Slate's Today's Papers  even cites Izvestia for the notion that this is smuggling-related.  But the Russian Government, castigated by the West for the way it has fought the war in Chechnya, has long been trying to tie that fight to the larger international campaign against terrorism by Islamic militants.  This seems to have been an opportunity Putin couldn't resist.  Just like he couldn't resist using a tough stance in Chechnya as a launching pad for the Russian presidency.  I think the true parallel lies in the fact that terror is the tactic of underdogs who cannot mount a true military campaign and nowhere are Muslims able to overthrow their oppressive governments.  The fact that Muslims in much of the Middle East, the Caucasus, Southwest and Central Asia all are being oppressed makes it appear all these Muslims have a common cause and makes militant Islam an attractive ideology.  I believe that if there was more freedom in different parts of the Islslamic world we would see different amounts of receptivity to militant Islam.  But until that freedom exists, the war in Chechnya will probably be as much a fight against militant Islam (not just separatism) as it is in the rest of the Islamic world.

          BUSH WANTS MORE TAX MONEY FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT  - In Afghanistan . . .  The U.S. wants local Afghan warlords to  urlLink swear fealty to Hamid Karzai and offer tribute or get thumped .  They are scheduled to meet Karzai this week.  Warlords are currently taking customs duties and tax money for themselves and their regions and not giving it to the national government.  The U.S. is finally recognizing that Karzai's government is too weak and the warlords too strong for the country's own good.  Though the warlords are expected to fall into line because they fear the loss of jobs that are key to their legitimacy, the U.S. is threatening to use U.S. forces as well as the Afghan National Army to reign them in.  I personally would like to see the Afghan National Army get used to take out noncompliant warlords and get some practice.  I think this can strengthen the Army, give its members more confidence and cohesion and make it a more effective national institution.  Afghanistan sure needs some.  Things seem sorry there, with no money flowing to the national government and people not getting paid.  Clearly the small-scale U.S. presence in Afghanistan has forced the U.S. to rely on the warlords to an extent that is bad for the country's long-term prospects of the country and the U.S. is starting to recognize this.  The U.S. may be able to get the warlords to play nice after this meeting, but I doubt for long.  The U.S. will have to project power out into the provinces, and that will require either more U.S. troops or deployment of the Afghan National Army.  My vote is that the Afghan National Army go out there, supported by the Special Forces soldiers that trained them.  As they gain experience, the soldiers should learn to do their jobs better and will not require Americans to hold their hands.  All this just makes me realize that  a lot  of hands-on political and military management is necessary for a successful transition whether in the Balkans after a Clintonian war or in Southwest/Central Asia after a Bushie war.  Who out there is against nation-building now?  Anybody?  I think the real debate is over  how much  U.S. involvement is necessary, and situations like this in Afghanistan make me want to say more, not less.  Less involvement means we have to rely on locals who can work at cross-purposes to U.S. interests.  More involvement allows us to create better institutions like national armies, and dare I say it, bureaucracies, where warlords previously ruled.

        TEXAS DEMOCRATS FLEE THE STATE!  Though I am certain many Democrats would like to flee Texas,  urlLink I had no idea it would come so quickly .  Republicans have a majority of the state legislature, but without a 100-member quorum cannot legislate.  Apparently the Republicans want to redistrict for Congress (allegedly  urlLink at the behest of Tom DeLay and Karl Rove ).  To prevent this, most of the Democratic members appear to have gone to Oklahoma to escape arrest by Texas Rangers.   It seemed odd that Texas Rangers would be chasing the Democrats down, but apparently the Governor is authorized by law to do this.  It also appears that Texas has  urlLink had this problem before .   urlLink Via PoliBlog .  Maybe the Texas Republicans should take a cue from their brethren in the U.S. Senate (who want to kill the longstanding filibuster rule) and change the rules so that a quorum of 100 members isn't required to legislate.

        U.S. TO FILE WTO COMPLAINT AGAINST EU GMO MORATORIUM  The U.S. finally decided to bring this dispute to the WTO, along with Canada, Argentina and Egypt.  Third parties on the U.S. side will include Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Uruguay.  This is a big case, but not as big as it could be apparently.  I read  urlLink USTR's press release  on the dispute and it seemed very careful not to mention a number of pieces of EC legislation that make it more difficult for American, Canadian, and other GMO producers to get their products to market, such as Directive 2001/18, that create labeling and traceability requirements, which are very expensive and difficult to comply with.  The U.S. appears to be acting very carefully to challenge nothing more than the EC's de facto moratorium on GMO imports -  maybe because it is not necessarily clear that the U.S. would win on the other issues.  However, the EC, in its  urlLink press release , seems to be defending based on the effectiveness of its approval process, so a large part of the EC's GMO mess really could get dragged in front of a Panel, in particular 2001/18.  If all the relevant issues were brought before a Panel, this could be the case that really defines the SPS Agreement, because this isn't just about an import ban like  EC - Hormones ,  Australia - Salmon , and  Japan - Varietals  were.  There are big issues like the trade-restrictiveness of the EC's GMO approval process and the relationship between the SPS and outside agreements like the Biosafety Protocol.

       UPDATE ON THE RIYADH BOMBING  Some say there were three attacks, accounts I have read discuss four bombing locations, though it is possible bombings damaged more than one of these locations at a time: The  Hamra , which had as many Arab as western residents, faced the main attack;  The  Granada  faced another attack;   Vinnell Corp ., a military consultancy to the Saudi National Guard, was attacked; and the  Saudi Maintenance Company  Siyanco , a joint U.S.-Saudi company with oil industry expertise. Slate's  urlLink Today's Papers  notes that no newspapers have a Riyadh byline - apparently because the Saudi government is being very tight-lipped about this attack (forget that royal family openness about the threat to Saudi Arabia from terrrorism everybody noted last week).  There is a "senior government official" being cited, with no nationality or name being given, who says Al Qaeda chatter was increasing and they likely succeeded here.  Secretary of State Powell said Al Qaeda had been weakened but was not dead; I guess this just goes to show that terrorist cells can survive serious damage to the overall network and still do a great deal of damage even if only partially successful.  There are  urlLink 29 deaths, 7 Americans among the dead, and 194  total casualties according to NYT, Powell said in a Saudi Arabia press conference that  urlLink 10 Americans  had died, though he later said his figures were based on earlier information and the U.S. embassy would release better figures.  urlLink No U.S. military casualties  are reported.  urlLink CNN says  9 terrorists are among the dead, and quotes Saudi Arabia's Prince Nayef as saying that the terrorists sought since last week were behind the attack.  A  urlLink British expatriate said  he thinks the attack was meant to show that foreigners are not safe anywhere in Saudi Arabia, even behind the walls of these walled and guarded compounds.  That sounds about right, though the attack on military and oil consultants seems to be sending the message that westerners will be attacked for working with the Saudi monarchy.  The attack on these foreign compounds may have also be undertaken because westerners are able to escape the strictures of Wahhabism there - women in bikinis at pools, alcohol, etc.   urlLink Intel Dump has a good analysis of why this could be Al Qaeda  based on tactics and objectives, looking at the information we have so far.

          BIG  ATTACK IN RIYADH  There have been a number of simultaneous attacks on Western areas in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Apparently attackers shot their way into foreign compounds (the Courdoval, Jedawal and The Hamra) and set off 4 car bombs, at least one of which could be seen from miles away.  40 Americans are reported among the approximately 60 wounded, with at least one westerner dead as well as a Saudi and a Lebanese.  This comes after the Saudis failed to capture a cell of Al Qaeda operatives, mostly Saudis with experience in Afghanistan or Chechnya. Articles:   urlLink NYT    urlLink AP    urlLink Reuters  I don't think anyone has the proof to draw the link, but this appears to be the result of failing to capture the members of the Al Qaeda cell for whom an exceptional public manhunt was launched by Saudi Arabia.  The U.S. and Australia warned of this attack and then it finally happened.  It tells you how terrorism works.  Prevention requires 100% success while terrorists can be successful part of the time or only be able to launch part of an attack (there was a large cache of explosives found last week in Riyadh) in order to have a "success." I just hope a lot of Americans and other westerners left after the warnings to Westerners rather than feeling secure inside the gated compounds in which they were attacked tonight.  Hopefully the recent decision to move American troops out of Saudi Arabia saved the lives of American soldiers or their dependents tonight.  The attacks were obviously well planned and coordinated, as the facilities which were attacked had armed guards posted, walls, and barriers  urlLink through which vehicles had to weave  in order to enter.  The cars were apparently driven by suicide bombers and had varying success.  The  urlLink New York Times  seems to have the best details of what happened in each attack, saying two vehicles exploded near rear entrances, prompting gunfire by guards, the other vehicles apparently made it inside the compounds, with one vehicle ramming a guard station at the gates, killing the guards.  Property damage, at least, appears to be very extensive.  The attack came as Colin Powell was due to arrive in Riyadh.  Powell said at a press conference in Amman that the attacks had the  urlLink earmarks of Al Qaeda .  According to a U.S. official, U.S. suspicions of Al Qaeda are based on intelligence of an attack warned of on May 1, the simultaneity of the attacks, which is an Al Qaeda trademark, and the fact that one bombed facility was near the Al Qaeda arms cache found last week.

       DIRTY BOMB DRILL  A lot of people say Seattle is a potential target for terrorist attack (probably because entry from Canada is so easy and those darn Canucks don't have a Patriot Act).   Well, Seattle did a test run of an emergency involving a radiological attack.  The quote of the day, from Seattle mayor Greg Nickels was:   "When a disaster occurs, people do not call the White House," Nickels said. "They call 911." I'll be checking with the White House to verify that one.  I think Mayor Nickels meant to say,  smart  people don't call the White House.  I mean, do you really think somebody in the Sit. Room is going to pick up and say, "Yes, Mr. Rowe, a speeding bus  did  just crash into the Space Needle..." if you made that call?  I mean, they didn't pick up when I called today . . . .

       WAS THE SHOOTING AT CASE WESTERN RESERVE OVER A WEBSITE?  The shooter that rampaged through the business school at Case Western Reserve on Friday (wearing a wig and World War II helmet in addition to fatigues) apparently graduated from that school in 1999, but since then his only tie to the university seems to have been a lawsuit against a university employee  urlLink for adding and deleting things from a personal website .  Halder lost an appeal of the dismissal of his suit about a month ago.  This guy seems crazy, but was the loss of his lawsuit over a web page the proximate cause of the shooting rampage?

       NEW SAUDI OPENNESS?  Has Saudi Arabia finally opened up to its public about the threat it faces from Al Qaeda?  After a shootout with militants, police investigating a March bombing discovered a large arms cache, including 800 pounds of the explosive RDX. The 19-member cell's members, all of whose members are on the run, have been named and a reward has been offered, a big change from the way Saudi Arabia usually blames attacks on misguided youth.  Does this response mean that Saudi Arabia is really changing?  Are they going to confront rather than accommodate the Islamists in the country?  I think they are afraid to, but now it has become obvious that the Saudi Government will have to.

       IS THE "ROAD MAP" ALREADY DEAD?  The New York Times  urlLink sure seems to think so .  It is at least on pause while Powell goes to the region to try to set up some ad hoc reciprocal steps that can be taken.  What this article seems to make obvious is that the people with the ultimate veto on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are the groups willing to launch terror attacks against Israel (Hamas, Al Aqsa Martyr Brigades, Islamic Jihad . . .).  If they disagree with whatever is going on, they just launch attacks, turning Israeli popular and political opinion against whatever peace options are set out and scuttling the peace process.  They won't stop attacking if Arafat or Abu Mazen ask them and would probably have to be taken out militarily, which doesn't seem possible even for Israel.  As I've written earlier, however, these parties seem like they will never accept a resolution that doesn't have them vanquishing the Israelis in some way.  That hard line position and the natural Israeli response seems to condemn the peace process to failure.  Maybe the road map is/was good in that it brought a relative moderate in Abu Mazen to the forefront to take over once Arafat dies, goes senile, or gives up the power ministries (the current division of ministries just leads to a weak Palestinian government, which terror groups probably love).  Maybe Abu Mazen can lead a trend toward moderation among Palestinians that will marginalize the ready-for-martyrdom groups.  But I agree with the  Times  that short-term prospects for peace are not great.

A beaver  urlLink has been spotted  in the Tidal Basin 4 years after a family of terroristic beavers  urlLink wreaked havoc  upon the basin's cherry trees until captured and moved humanely to an undisclosed location in Rock Creek Park.  The Park Service, which had an embarrasingly hard time catching the wily critters last time, had better do a better job of capturing this varmint.    The Bush Administration, unlike those pansies from the last Administration, has no tolerance for these terrorists.  No negotiations.  No coddling.  The U.S. government needs to take a firm stand here, at the Tidal Basin, before other important bodies of water in downtown Washington begin to fall to the Commie beavers.  They have already made one known attack this week - by letting a dam fail in Michigan, the fundamentalist beavers  urlLink derailed a CSX freight train .  If we dont push them back here, right now, beavers could be in the Reflecting Pool next week.  They could climb the fence and attack the White House - it is partly wood, after all.  I think Bill Murray captured the attitude that needs to be taken best in  urlLink  Caddyshack  , where he said: To kill, you must know your enemy, and in this case [the] enemy is a varmint. And a varmint will never quit - ever. They're like the Viet Cong - Varmint Cong. So you have to fall back on superior firepower and superior intelligence . . . We face a resilient enemy, willing to wait years until our defenses have softened.  We must strike now, and strike hard; we must shock and awe the beavers if we are ever to truly deter them from attacking our precious cherry trees.  And don't stop visiting the Tidal Basin due to fear of the beavers.  If we do that, then the terroristic beavers have already won.

        MONKEYS GIVEN COMPUTER DON'T WRITE SHAKESPEARE  Well, this is a shocker: Six Sulawesi crested macaques at the Paignton Zoo in England  urlLink were given a computer  to play with to see whether they would gradually begin to type the works of Shakespeare... Remember the line about a million monkeys in a million years writing the complete works of Shakespeare?  Well these monkeys didn't type much more than a few  S s, instead choosing to beat the machine and urinate and defecate upon it.  This led me to two conclusions.  Thomas Huxley, who supposedly thought up the Shakespearean monkey line, gave way too much credit to the monkeys, who it turns out like typing for free about as much as human office workers; Humans seem to be slightly better able to repress our rage when dealing with computers. What were the researchers trying to do with  urlLink this goofy study ?  I don't know.  Maybe grab attention for themselves and the zoo or stave off boredom. Well, look at the bright side: for once it wasn't paid for with American taxpayers' money.

       OH, THE THINGS I HAVE SEEN PART II  Other things I've seen in the last 24 hours: the last two   urlLink Alias   episodes from this season, the latest  urlLink Matrix animated short ,  urlLink the second X-Men movie  and an episode of   urlLink Survivor  .  My conclusions from all I've seen:   The Alias season ending was good.  I'm pretty sure the surprise at the end has something to do with Sloan's assembly of the big bad Rambaldi device.  I've been very tolerant of this show as regards the Rambaldi crap.  In my opinion the show is really about the mission-impossible/CIA stuff, not the X-files ripoff Rambaldi stuff.  The show doesn't do the X-files stuff well or even that believeably, so hopefully the pretty regular tweaking of the show will phase this stuff out.  What I'm afraid is that  next season will start with some weird rehash of the plot of   urlLink Back to the Future II  : if Syd is just able to take out Sloan's super Rambaldi Device, she'll be able to transport back in time and none of the stuff that happened in the last few minutes of the final episode will have happened.  As dumb as that sounds, the stupid Rambaldi Plot Device is such a big fudge factor and the final few episodes cranked up the  urlLink X-files  stuff up to such an extent I don't know how things will work next season.  I thought the show had taken the post-September 11 hint, but apparently not to the extent I had hoped.      urlLink The Matrix   is a great movie, hopefully a great series.  This latest short,  Second Renaissance: Part II , is the second and most relevant part of the back story to  The Matrix .    It isn't quite as nuanced as you would hope, but this  is  science fiction.  I actually didn't laugh, for the first time, at the "the machines needed power and turned to humans for a bioeletric power source" explanation for the slavery of humans.  Of course, it only makes any kind of sense to me in the short term; in the longer-term the humans should be the subject of genocide and the machines should be relying on a better source of energy, but I don't want to poke too many holes.  The short also made me realize that if the movie were actually to lead to some kind of revolution outside of the slick world of the Matrix, it would look a lot like the nightmarish machine-human war of the  urlLink Terminator  series.  And the war scenes in the short seem to make it clear that the humans are drastically inferior to the machines militarily, so any revolution will have to involve co-option of machines and an internal revolution within machine society in favor of accommodating humans.  Maybe Neo & Co. will be able to co-opt the same humanitarians that created the Matrix itself instead of just sucking the life out of the humans.     urlLink X2  was enjoyable.  I think the story wasn't insulting and there were tons of action.  What was most interesting was the management of a large ensemble cast - even bigger than that of the first movie.  Do directors do this?  Do writers?  I don't know, but whoever it was did a pretty good job of giving everyone some kind of role and even allowed for some character development.  I never read more than a few issues of X-Men, but the ending hints very strongly that the big tragedy at the end of X2 is by no means final.     urlLink Survivor .  I've only seen a couple episodes of this season, but I have become convinced that the girl voted off tonight,  urlLink Heidi , has fake boobs.  They are just too obviously disproportionate to her now bony frame.  But no, that's not why I didn't change the channel.  Not at all.

       OH THE THINGS I HAVE SEEN PART I  After taking my last major final last night I am watching television again.  If what was on TV tonight isn't a sign of the apocalypse, I don't know what is.   On UPN, the WWE's hilariously opportunistic  urlLink Mister America , who claims  not  to be Hulk Hogan, reappeared to vex Mr. McMahon - in Toronto of all places.  Mister America embarrassed McMahon and carried his daughter away.  Needless to say, Mr. McMahon is somewhat angered by this turn of events.  On Fox tonight, the guy who played Peterman and the woman from exotic dating or extreme dating or X-otic dating or whatever it's called (a.k.a. the less raspy-voiced woman from  Good Day Live! ) presided over the Fox dog of the night.  It was, in fact, the "First Annual"  urlLink Miss Dog Beauty Pageant . Complete with evening wear ("Miss Oregon is wearing a heather green halter dress) and Peterman belting a ripoff of  Here She is, Miss America  for the winner.  Ah, Fox, you never cease to amaze me.  But you gotta love this stuff.  And it makes up for the fact that I'm enjoying   urlLink Frontline   right now.

         MILITARY TRIBUNALS SET TO START  The Department of Defense  urlLink now has a list of names  of the prisoners (remember all those guys in Guantanamo?) it is planning to prosecute using military commissions (though DOD won't release the list).  Here is  urlLink the transcript  of DOD's background briefing.  Commissions could begin deciding cases next week, one expert said.  The Department of Defense issued 8 instructions for military commissions.  Here they are (in PDF):   urlLink Military Commission Order No. 1    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 2    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 3    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 4    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 5    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 6    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 7    urlLink Military Commission Instruction No. 8  I wish I could write more about this, but it is finals time.  Ironically, military tribunals are one of the few subjects we studied in my federal courts class that I actually understand.

         U.S. MOVING TROOPS Does shift to southeastern Europe make presence in Kosovo indefinite?  The U.S. is planning to move troops out of Germany and Italy into new NATO countries in Eastern Europe.  Some articles make the troop shifts seem like a short-term reaction to American problems with Germany or "Old Europe" in general.  However, the moves seem longer-term, more about the flexibility U.S. forces need to have in order to maximize American power projection.  Part of the problem  is  conflict with locals over bases, but it isn't just politics - it seems the new bases will be in more rural areas rather than in highly urban western Europe, making it easier for the U.S. to move troops and materiel and expand if necessary [not to mention avoid pesky protesters].  The move to southeastern Europe would put U.S. troops closer to action in the Middle East or Southwest Asia without actually having to put them in harm's way.  See, e.g.,  the unfortunate bombings in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia (Khobar Towers) in 1996.  One interesting point regarding the possible moving of U.S. troops was that Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo was on the list of bases  urlLink the L.A. Times  believed might receive more troops.  To me that would signal that Kosovo was going to be home to U.S. troops for a long time.  I can imagine that would have good consequences.  It would be a good place for soldiers on their way to fighting elsewhere to learn something about peacekeeping, which increasingly seems to be a more difficult role than actual warfighting for American troops.  This also lets the U.S. put off the final status issues regarding Kosovo, which are rather problematic.  Basing American troops there for reasons unrelated to maintaining order in Kosovo, however, would help propagate the idea that the U.S. intends to keep Kosovo as a protectorate in southeastern Europe.  If American troops are to be based there until the need for European-based troops to deal with problems in the Middle East goes away, our soldiers could be in Kosovo for a very long time to come.

         SHOULD THE U.S. BE RUTHLESS IN IRAQ?  Yesterday I read  urlLink an article  in Slate by David Plotz, the gist of which was that the U.S. should be ruthless in engaging Iraqi resistance and "spoilers" so as to establish order.  The article was interesting - I think Machiavelli was on to something in terms of governance - but I wonder if the "ruthless engagement" theory is the way the U.S. should rule in Iraq, especially if we want the Iraqis to think of Americans as liberators.   The cases I am thinking of are Mosul and Falluja, both towns with significant anti-American populations from the pro-Saddam Arab Sunni minority that used to be in charge.  In both Mosul and Falluja, the Americans fired into protesting crowds to disperse them and apparently hurt children.  At least fifteen civilians were shot and killed by Americans over the last week in Falluja.  This seems like the robust engagement Plotz is talking about.  It just seems that it hasn't had the effect of forcing people to go back to their homes, in fact it has led to anti-American violence - someone  urlLink threw a grenade  at an American base, wounding seven soldiers.  Is the U.S. going to send more troops into Falluja?  They have already beefed up the troop presence in Mosul and have moved to disarm the peshmerga (I don't know if U.S. forces have tried to disarm Baath supporters in Mosul, but my money says they're working hard on this).     The ruthless engagement theory would support doing all of these things.  But I don't think the ruthless engagement rule provides the right framework for dealing with angry crowds.  Shooting to disperse crowds will only inflame locals and convince them Americans aren't the good guys.  Civilians will inevitably be shot along with gunmen.  We also see divergent stories emerging.  The soldiers don't seem to be telling the complete truth about being shot at or about shooting accurately at gunmen.  Anti-American locals spread rumors that Americans are shooting entirely indiscriminately at civilians protesting peacefully.  It doesn't matter which side is right, only that locals are turned against the Americans once they shoot into crowds.  The result: the protests get bigger, Americans have more difficulty controlling them, security threats increase and the populace suddenly hates its would-be liberators.  These problems would seem to be directly traceable to a ruthless engagement strategy.   The problem with ruthless engagement is that Americans aren't just operating on the Machiavellian level in Iraq.  We  are  trying to do good and win hearts and minds.  The Iraqi counter-strategy seems to be to require Americans to attack ruthlessly and harm civilians because we don't have the manpower or knowledge to act in a way more narrowly tailored toward getting the bad guys.  It's the anti-Mogadishu strategy.  In Mogadishu fighters used civilians as shields knowing Americans would hesitate before shooting at them.  If Americans follow a ruthless engagement strategy, Iraqi troublemakers will know that Americans will try to shoot them, so they join or organize civilian crowds to protect themselves.  I wonder if the fact that Americans will be forced to kill civilians trying to defend themselves from shooters in the crowd goes into their calculations.     I don't have a great answer, but I think ruthless engagement is a bad way to deal with protesting crowds.

       CANADA REJECTS MONSANTO GMO WHEAT  Canada is  urlLink on the U.S. side in the GMO dispute  against the EU, but  this story , outlining how the Canadian Wheat Board rejected Roundup Ready Wheat a few days ago, just shows how a GMO crop approval process can be abused for trade-restrictive reasons.  CWB Asks Monsanto to Withdraw GMO Wheat Application  Tue May 27, 1:08 PM ET  WINNIPEG (Reuters) - The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), one of the world's largest grain exporters, said on Tuesday it asked Monsanto to withdraw its application to test its genetically modified (GMO) wheat in Canada. 	  The CWB, which controls prairie-grown wheat and barley exports from Canada, has said Monsanto's herbicide resistant Roundup Ready wheat (RRW) was unwanted by Canada customers like Japan. On Tuesday, CWB said RRW would have a "devastating economic impact" on Canadian farmers.  "Economic harm could cost lost access to premium markets, penalties caused by rejected shipments, and increased farm management and grain handling costs," Ken Ritter, CWB chairman, and Adrian Measner, CWB president, said in a letter to Monsanto Canada president Peter Turner.  I mean, Canadian farmers couldn't choose to use Roundup Ready Wheat and face the consequences?  Aren't they businessmen (and women)?  Or is the tricky Monsanto going to keep them from understanding the potential pros and cons of growing its products?

       COLOMBIA'S IN ON THE GAME NOW  Colombia has requested to join consultations in the GMO dispute.  Their request is below.  So that brings the tally to the U.S., Canada, and Argentina now as complainants, with Peru and Colombia wishing to join consultations.  Looks like we may have the Americas against the EU on this one.   After the big announcement of who was on our side,  urlLink Egypt has backed out of the dispute .   This probably won't be a big deal for the dispute, it just leads me to realize that phone calls and deals are being made lining up parties on each side here - WTO members aren't getting involved or staying out of this dispute simply based on calm deliberation of what is legally correct.  And it seems that the dispute over GMOs has spread out of the Americas and Europe [and Egypt] to the Pacific Rim,  urlLink where Japan has irked the United States by asking for GMO labeling , apparently in an APEC meeting.  APEC member state scientists will apparently begin scientific research on GMOs.  To me, that's good.  The research may get some scientific answers to the GMO dispute that won't be considered suspect because they aren't being provided by the EU or the U.S.  Also in Asia, China  urlLink extended an interim rule"  requiring a lot of hoop-jumping to import GMO imports - how China ultimately decides on GMOs could have a big effect on  U.S. - China agricultural trade.  There is currently a $1 billion soybean trade between the U.S. and China.

       THE GMO DISPUTE AND THE DOHA ROUND How big is this dispute?  I just saw  urlLink a post  by Daniel Drezner about the fault of the French in the big debate of the Doha Round: removing agricultural subsidies.  He said the U.S. isn't without blame, but I think the U.S. GMO case is going to be a bigger problem than many think.  That dispute is going to keep agriculture lobbies in the U.S., France, and elsewhere in the EU constantly arguing for their governments to stick it to the other guy rather than negotiate.  The dispute settlement system may get its first big reform when it helps crash a round of negotiations.  Hey, I may be blowing this dispute out of proportion, but I doubt it.  It's going to start getting hot about the time the real negotiation should be happening.  But, I just remembered, there is also the alternative theory of the GMO dispute: the U.S. can use a win there as a bargaining chip against the Common Agricultural Policy.  That would be pretty cynical, but it's about time for the U.S. to start playing hardball.  European policy on agriculture hasn't changed through just talking about it.

       EU PLAN FOR PEACE BETWEEN SYRIA/LEBANON & ISRAEL  Reading in the New York Times today, I saw that Jacques Chirac raised the possibility of an EU "road map" for peace between Israel and Syria/Lebanon at the opening peace settlement meeting in Egypt.  He was careful to say it was being developed by EU foreign minister Javier Solana (who many in the US like) and that it wasn't a French plan.  Even if it isn't a French plan, it seems a way for Chirac, who had a good relationship with papa Assad, and France, with historical ties to Syria and Lebanon, to stick a finger in the pie of mideast peace.  I just can't see it being a good thing; we already have the U.S., Israel, and Palestine involved, all we'd see is another country trying to showboat and stick up for  its  substantive vision for peace in the middle east.  How annoying.

       CAIN'S MILIEU  I finished reading  The Postman Always Rings Twice  and most of the short stories in the book and it was interesting how in several different stories he built up an odd and interesting world.  He uses an observant first person narrator in several of his stories and the protagonist is very often sort of a drifter/bum type of guy with a sketchy past at bit at odds with those he meets who are rooted in, or occasionally trapped in, the not always humdrum world of Depression-era southern California.  He uses some of the same material in  Postman  that he uses in  Baby in the Icebox,  notably wild cats and tigers in odd non-circus settings, like a roadside zoo.  He also uses the same basic premises of the observant drifter/mechanic who ends up watching domestic friction grow in small roadside gasoline stand/motel settings in L.A. county.  I should look up more of the origins of both stories - I would bet that he wrote  Baby in the Icebox  first, as a short-story writer, then when he had his first shot at writing a novel for a big publisher he took the most interesting elements of a good story and worked them into a different story because he knew they worked.    After reading  Pastorale , sort of a modern folk tale, I wonder where he gets the odd dialect he uses.  His characters use this phrase I've never heard, "hope my die" instead of something like "I sure hope" (I'm just analogizing roughly without digging the book back out).  The introduction says he spent time in West Virginia, I wonder if it isn't a localism from somewhere up in the hills and hollers.  I think I'll read  Double Indemnity  tomorrow, which I think has something to do with insurance.  Insurance is oddly enough part of Cain's world as well, apparently he had some experience in the business, which he uses (rather confusingly, I must say) to some extent in  Postman .  I'm also trying to figure out why he titled it  The Postman Always Rings Twice .  Was it something to do with the two attempts at murder?  A larger theme of the book?  Or did I just happen to miss some telling incident with a mailman as I read the story this morning.  I'll look at it again to try to figure that out.

       Things I want to do, now that I've finished with the bar exam:   Read the  urlLink James M. Cain book  Barnes & Noble delivered just before the exam to tempt me, which includes:   The Postman Always Rings Twice Double Indemnity Mildred Pierce  (the movie version of which I happened across one late night on PBS) and several shorter stories, including:   Pastorale The Baby in the Ice Box Dead Man Brush Fire  and  The Girl in the Storm      Rent and watch  urlLink My Cousin Vinny , which I've never seen, and whatever new movies strike my fancy.  Maybe  urlLink Seabiscuit  or  urlLink 28 Days Later  if I can bring myself to go.   Update myself on the GMO dispute between the U.S. and EU -  I lost track somewhere after the Europeans passed new regulations removing the moratorium at the heart of the dispute.   Hit the mountains - I'd like to hike, if I could get home to the mountains somehow.   Play soccer.   Run.    Drink, socialize, and  just relax . Of course, the one thing I've learned in what little growing up I've done is that obligations never cease, though wonders really don't come along all that often.   I have to take the MPRE next Friday, and I have to start pounding the pavement to get a job as soon as possible . . . .  . . which, of course, is necessary to get the new apartment, car and everything else I've been itching for. And -  oh yeah -  that'll allow me to stop staring at my feet whenever somebody asks me, "what do you do?"  Well, the job search can wait for tomorrow, it's time for bed.

      I wrote up a new XHTML template for bunkshooter.  I don't know if it'll do anything besides make it harder for me to post, what with XML's tougher rules.  I hoped it would make an RSS scrape better, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I guess I'll just have to figure out whether I can make a page that is RSS with CSS formatting.  I think that's possible.  I'm not sure in fact that the page is valid, because the advertising that is added at the top by blogger is put there by a piece of code that has its own DOCTYPE.  I think.  And I can't figure out what to do with the comments script.  According to the O'Reilly book I'm using, the script won't work any more unless I put it in these CDATA comments, but it doesn't seem to work at all.  OH, and of course it won't validate.  I'm going to take  forever  doing this.

      The problem seems to be that I can't generate rss automatically using blogger, so I have to use someone else's rss generation - rssify, blogmatrix, etc.  They are all unsatisfying as they don't scrape enough content, often only taking the titles of my posts.  That's lame.  I could write a file and post every new blog entry there as xml, handcoded, but, I mean - hand-coding XML after using blogger?  Why not just hand-code the whole frikking site?

      There were  urlLink bombings at a biotech firm today  that are surmised to be the work of animal rights groups.    What's odd is that I watched  urlLink 12 Monkeys  last week for the first time.  The movie, which involved an animal rights group alleged to have destroyed the Earth's population, was most disturbing because the group seemed so hyper-destructive and abnormal.  The animal rights group seemed audacious but not out of character to have murdered 99% of the Earth's population for the sake of animals.  The odd thing is that rather than dispel these types of stereotypes, radical animal advocates seem to live up to them by trashing the homes of biotech company executives, harassing them, and even bombing their headquarters.  Do they really think that such a campaign will turn people against biotechnology or stop companies from using animals in experiments?  I seriously doubt their tactics have any desired effect, other than satisfying the eco-terorrists' desire to strike back at biotech companies.    If they really wanted to stop biotechnology business practices that harm animals or stop biotechnology in general, they need to win hearts and minds.  And just like the terrorists in Iraq who bombed the UN building, their strategy does not seem designed to win hearts and minds in any way I can understand.

       ANDY WANTS RSS!  Since I've started using  urlLink Newsmonster  I've been itching to make an RSS feed out of bunkshooter.  I saw a few people using auto-generated RSS and thought that would be the simple brainless thing to do.  No dice.  While the things (blogstreet and blogmatrix) will turn out a feed, they aren't satisfactory at all.  I want to be able to look at the content of posts, not just a headline and a snippet.  So I'm going to have to keep looking.  I've read that Blogger Pro or Blogspot Plus will make an RSS feed for you, but I can't order that because Blogger shut down ordering for both of the above months ago, for an indefinite term.  That's annoying - it would take a lot for me to migrate away from Blogger as things stand now.  Those who got rid of their ads and made other such upgrades to Blogger before Blogger folks shut down ordering were just lucky, I guess.    Now that I think about it, why wouldn't Blogger work to get ordering back online quickly?  Isn't that a big moneymaker for them?  I just don't get why they won't get things up and running, and it's frustrating.

      I scan my few precious hits to check out who's reading and the other day I noticed at hit from an "NIPR.mil" address.  I was interested to figure out where that was - some institute of the National Defense University variety?  Or somebody reading the site from a sensitive machine, giving a fake address?  That'd be pretty cool, I thought.  Somebody smart is reading what Gabe and I have to say.  I did some looking around and it turns out  urlLink NIPR.mil is the network DOD people use to access the Internet from their own computers .  At least according to the always-accurate Internet.    So it could really be anybody, just somebody who is in the U.S. military or works for the U.S. military.  So it's not really that exciting.  Oh well.  Did I mention some German guys looked at my writeup on the  Matrix Revolutions  trailer and called it an inofficial script? Wow, how low have I sunk that I consider that cool?

      Just noticed an article on cryptome.org entitled  urlLink Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  from the Dept. of Health and Human Services. This reminds me of what I was thinking at the time that the smallpox vaccine was being administered. How many people are going to get sick from this vaccine while in reality the main reason this is being administered is to fuel fears of Americans about terrorists.   Here were the primary things that stick out in my mind as methods of inciting fears in Americans in order to start a war in Iraq.  1. Apparently all bad terrorists happen to be Muslim,  urlLink FBI's Top 22 Terrorists (all Muslim)  2. Iraqi's are Arabs and Islamic. Osama bin Laden is Arab and a muslim and comes from the country near Iraq, so something is probably going on with Iraq and him, guilty by association. 3. Some crazy person in the US decides to send Anthrax to people he wants to take out and pin it on Terrorists. 4. Iraq wanted to get Nuclear weapons. 5. Iraq might use Smallpox or Nerve Gas on US troops. 6. We suddenly started getting all sorts of vague threats on stuff like the Brooklyn bridge and we had this terror alert thing at orange all the time. Whoever thought up the idea for the terror alert got a raise I bet. 7. Suddenly there was this risk of a dirty bomb, which is basically the same thing as somebody stealing a bucket of nuclear waste and dumping it into a ventilation shaft at a subway. 8. Finally, I wouldn't doubt there happens to be a news story coming up about FOX News getting funneled money from the US Govt. for helping to sell the war. Good job O'Reilly--which I would like to note has about the worst style and logic of a talk show personality and is horribly rude to any guests he has.  9. People like the Dixie Chicks or the Bowling for Columbine guy were lambasted for not supporting the president. What this says to me is that people knew the case for war was weak, but we still wanted to go to war because if we didn't after all the threats we'd look dumb.   Essentially, our govt. made a case for war using some carefully crafted propaganda. My main take on Saddam Hussein is that he is just an evil, greedy, power hungry guy. Whatever he needed to do to maintain this lifestyle he would do. Yes, he wanted to conquer Iran and Kuwait, which is what made him cross that line of sane to insane, but I would rather have this stuff debated openly rather than something where the president takes us into a conflict like a dictator rather than a democratic country.  Yes, it could be argued it was a war for oil and the potential outcome is amazing if we can control the oil supply, but we are just getting embroiled in so much stuff now its asking for trouble. Our only hope is to vote Bush out and make it look like we think he was a crazy person and we didn't realize what he was going to do to our country. If we re-vote him back in, we'll be saying to the Muslim world, "see we as a whole support our president that was a war-monger."  This whole presidency has been full of behind-closed door politics. Whether its the energy meetings that everybody  urlLink lost notes to  or the African uranium, we are dealing with one thing that is quite possibly similar to what other countries live under. You have a dumb leader and he rules by fear rather than trust and respect.   The thing that still gets me is really just how horrible the september 11th attacks were and what we should do about it? Most of us want to live in a country where we don't have to fear that kind of thing happening, but is the best way to tell other countries to watch out if they sponsor terrorists is to go conquer their country? Tough call...  More and more my sneaking suspicion is that the September 11th people were just a crazed group, supported in part my Osama Bin Laden, but mostly like a neo-nazi type group, with far less connections than we are led to believe.  So the point of this post? A call for more transparency of operations in our goverment so we as a people can help make decisions when our government needs guidance, rather than our goverment telling us what is best for us.

      There is an  urlLink AP Story  that says there was equipment the UN inspected that had enriched Uranium on it. Iran says the equipment was purchased from other people which could have contaminated it. Question for me then, if the contaminated equipment didn't come from Iran, who did they buy it from that was making weapons grade nuclear materials?

      I've been having trouble with my dialup connection to the Internet.  Instead of getting broadband like smart people with jobs, I've decided to get an RSS feed aggregator and go to my undergrad library where I can use  their  broadband connection.    But I didn't know what aggregator to get.  I first read about  urlLink AmphetaDesk , which sounds popular, but I couldn't get it to work right on my Windows ME machine.  So I looked around and found  urlLink NewsMonster , a Mozilla extension.  I'm a big fan of Mozilla (I use Firebird for browsing) so I thought it would work great.    Installation for Windows was OK, though I had problems because I was using a daily build of Mozilla and had to uninstall it and install 1.4.  For Linux, however, it was a disaster as I couldn't seem to get the Java settings right and  Newsmonster relies on Java to work.  Another Linux learning curve problem: I could probably figure out what prevents it from working, it'd just take the next two weeks.  So I set up Newsmonster in Windows.  I set it up to download about 100 RSS feeds, most of the blogs I read and other news sources.  That turned out to be a huge download, and worse, a big memory drain.  I pretty much had to start aggregation and forget about touching the machine.  I guess 256 MB of RAM isn't enough any more.  But once it was done, I could go home without needing the Internet for anything other than checking my email - so long as I could get by on the morning's information.  As I look through the feeds I've downloaded, I'm a bit disappointed by the amount of content I'm actually getting.  I don't want  Washington Post   headlines , I want  Washington Post   articles .  So I need to find more RSS feeds with "content" or "cache" or "toggle for more" rather than "permalink" (which pretty much defeats the point).

      I missed posting Sunday and Monday because I'm working on a big project that I'd like to turn into a post (a  big  one), a writing sample and maybe even an essay.    The big project: the  urlLink U.S.  (and  urlLink Canada  and  urlLink Argentina )'s chances of success in its  urlLink WTO dispute with the EU over genetically modified organism (GMO)-based products .   urlLink A complaint is going to be filed soon .  I've followed the dispute reasonably well so far in the news, but I haven't looked at the legal bases of the dispute and the challenged regulations that carefully.  I don't know if anybody else is writing about this; hopefully I'll be able to add to the discourse on the subject.  I'll be posting on little things, but probably won't be jumping in on any major subjects for a while, as much as I'd like to blog about the " urlLink desperation thesis " (the follow-up to the flypaper thesis) or  urlLink increased aid to Afghanistan .

       IT'S A WAR ABOUT OIL   Nigerian troops are providing the backbone of a peacekeeping force in Liberia.  But a great deal of violence is occurring in Nigeria's own Niger Delta.  In a fight over political power and oil, approximately  urlLink 100 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded in Warri, Delta State .  The fighting appears to be rooted in ethnic conflict between Ijaws and Itsekiris and to have been manipulated by organized criminals seeking to control the trade in stolen crude oil.

       AMERICAN SPLENDOR   This movie has received tremendous reviews and I can't disagree.  It's sad, sweet, and often funny.  I can understand the stuff the guy has to go through and the loneliness of his grinding life.    I also feel like the movie did a good job of capturing the essence of Harvey Pekar, the author of the autobiographical  American Splendor  underground comic books series.  Pekar seems like a guy with depressive tendencies for whom life turned out to be worthwhile even thought it's often painful and lonely (the filmmakers make sure you get this point by showing Pekar surrounded by family and friends at his retirement at the end of the movie).  The movie is interesting because of its characters.  Harvey, his friend Toby, and his wife Joyce seem to be movie caricatures until the moviemakers actually introduce you to the real people.  These people are unstylish, odd and unwilling to assimilate into ordinary society or go along with other people's BS.  They scorn yuppies and fashion and aren't overly concerned about cleanliness.  I mean, their lives revolve around underground comics, for God's sake!    They are therefore thoroughly interesting characters in a society where most people are blissfully ignorant and bourgeois.    The movie is also interesting technically.  It shifts constantly between the narrative story, in which Paul Giamatti grimaces his way through Harvey's life as a lonely file clerk/autobiographical comics writer, and biographical interviews the actual Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce and his friend Toby.  You are introduced to this technique early on - the scratchy voice-over you hear at the beginning of the movie turns out to be the real Harvey Pekar, and he continues to comment on the actors' performances and the progress of the movie and his own life.  The movie even mixes in animation with live action.  This self-conscious and commentatorial technique fits  American Splendor  rather well.  After all, the movie is about an autobiographical writer who writes comics, which are often filled with the interior thoughts of their characters.    I'm no film buff, but I do watch a decent amount of movies.  I would say that I was "prepared" for this technique by seeing  Adaptation , which had similar metafictional self-references and tormented characters, and  A Mighty Wind , which had some of the same dry documentary humor.  On a final, more personal note, I took notice of how Harvey Pekar became a more studious observer of life once he started writing  American Splendor . I certainly feel more like a more studious observer of life now that I write this blog.

       THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS TRAILER   Scene-by-scene rundown on what happens in the new  Matrix: Revolutions  trailer.  All this takes place in 1 minute, 20 seconds, by the way.   Warning : I refer to information from  Matrix: Reloaded .  If you haven't seen that, you may want to before reading this.  VOICEOVER [older woman (sounds like Oracle)]: "Everything that has a beginning has an end."  [dramatic, rythmic music rises]  Camera comes into focus, turning, to show Neo lying on something grayish-white (made of metal?) in black shirt/tie/jacket.  He appears to be waking up.  Somebody is seen from the back watching data on screens in a ship.  I don't recognize him from the previous films.  Flashes of Morpheus turning fading to Neo picking himself off the ground surrounded by glass, then fading to Trinity taking off her sunglasses.  VOICEOVER [older woman]: "I see the end coming."  Cut to CGI/artwork mega-machine - it appears massive and menacing, Gigeresque.  It seems to have an opening maw.  Electricity arcs across it in several places.  VOICEOVER [older woman]: "I see the darkness spreading."  The fluorescent lights in a utilitarian concrete grayish/green and white underground passageway successively wink out from the back of the passageway.  Cut to Asian martial artist program (Seraph) from  Reloaded  spin-kicking what appears to be a bad guy in the face.  Scene is in a rain-slicked parking lot with some nice cars.  The parking lot may be the same as that seen in  Reloaded .  Cut to Neo standing in high-collared outfit at night in torrential rain.  Go from black screen to show ex-Agent Smith wading out to the double-lined center of a city street in torrential rain.  He appears to be flanked on both sides of the street by an infinite army of Smiths and turns to face the camera (Neo).  VOICEOVER [older woman]: "I see death."  Cut to Smith, sans sunglasses, LAUGHING with sinister glee and standing in an apartment kitchen. Two cupboard doors are open and their contents have been pushed around.  The apartment looks to be that of the Oracle.  If so, Smith is looking toward the kitchen doorway.  Go from white screen to show what appears to be a Zion ship in a cavern full of machinery or detritus.  Quick cut to goateed guy with sensor on his forehead opening his eyes.  This appears to be the man who lay opposite Neo at the end of  Reloaded .  He is the human "download" of a Smith.  Quick cut to Link pointing a gun-like weapon to the left.  It is probably one of those electric shock weapons humans use on sentinels (and occasionally on each other).  Quick cut to Persephone in red leather and matching lipstick.  Shadows in the background may be Trinity and another person with a long-handled weapon, likely one of Merovingian's henchmen.  Quick cut to subway train hurtling toward the camera.  Quick cut to a swarm of sentinels, which appear to have evolved to look more like skeletal fish than octopi.  Maybe these are a new type of sentinel like that launched at Nebuchadnezzar at the end of  Reloaded .  Smith faces past camera standing in torrential rain.  Lightning flashes.  He says sarcastically:   SMITH: "Mr. Anderson, welcome back. . . We missed you."  Cut to Neo facing back at Smith.  He says:  NEO: "It ends tonight."  [choral/symphonic music rises]  Both men are shown clenching fists.  Cut to show an explosion filling a cavernous factory-like structure with walkways.  The structure's vertical orientation is shifted left to about 10:00.  This looks like the mechanical heart of Zion.  Fade to Link again, he has a weapon with a bright light at its end.  Is it firing?  He appears to be out in the wasteland of Earth, like near the end of  Reloaded .  Fade to show Seraph drawing two pistols upwards from his stomach, a la Hong Kong action flicks.  Fade to Trinity, impassive.  Hulking machine creatures are shown walking across the scorched Earth like massive potato bugs.  Electricity flashes across the machines and in the sky as the screen fades to black.  A pair of futuristic but weathered doors open to show a green neon-lit club, where Morpheus and Trinity stand with both arms straight out, pointing guns at the crowd. Green light is at eye level.  Cut to Neo's back as he walks up the street toward Smith in the torrential rain.    Neo looks to his right to see a horde of Smiths making varying grimaces in his direction from the side of the street.  The far side of the street is also packed 2-and 3-deep with Smiths.  VOICEOVER [older woman]: "You are all that stands in his way."  The screen cuts quickly from Neo's vantage, showing Smith at a short distance, somewhat obscured by rain, to show Neo the same way from Smith's perspective.  VOICEOVER [older woman]: "If you cannot stop him tonight, then I fear that tomorrow may never come."   Water flies off both Neo and Smith as they begin to run toward each other and the camera looks down upon them as they reach one another in the center of the screen.  Smith and Neo punch each other at the same time, sending each other flying.  Cut to Trinity, leaping to avoid bullets being fired at her by a dust-obscured figure in a room with thick, bullet-riddled columns.  She flips clockwise from behind a column.  Cut to two men standing, struggling over what appears to be a firing electricity weapon in what looks like a ship.  Maybe this is the Smith-programmed human (Wurm, right?) struggling with whoever is manning the ship while the regulars are in the Matrix.  Cut to Morpheus, Seraph, and Trinity lined up firing guns at off-screen bad guys.  Possibly as a result, we see a bald guy wearing sunglasses, a guy with a helmet (or hood?), and a woman with a braid flying up into the air and losing control of weapons.  They are in a room with thick columns like that where Trinity was seen flipping away from a person shooting.  Trinity is next seen arms spread, kicking into the ribs of a man hanging from the ceiling who is wearing some kind of SWAT-type get-up with a black mask/hood.  Quick cut to what appears to be an explosion in human technology - maybe another shot of what I suppose is the Zion explosion?  Quick cut to what appears to be a man in black jumpsuit, like the hooded man, fighting a man in lighter clothing ON THE CEILING of the room where the explosion blew the sunglasses-wearer, the helmeted or hooded guy and the woman with the braid upward.  Cut to Seraph pointing a pistol at a long-haired person with a pistol who is mostly obscured (a woman?) despite being surrounded by thugs pointing guns at him.  One of the men pointing a pistol at Seraph appears to be wearing a white gas mask.  The obscured long-haired person has a fingerless glove, and the others seem to be wearing odd clothing.  Unless I'm wrong, one of them seems to be wearing something made of latex with space for his face cut out.  (Extremely wierd).  The bald sunglasses-wearing man who Seraph kicked in the face at the beginning of the trailer is seen grimacing and pointing a pistol.  Trinity, to his side but behind him from the viewer's perspective, pulls up his arm so he cannot hit what he is aiming at.  Quick cut to a scene of the hulking bug-like machines marching over the Earth's surface.  One is struck by lightning.  Quick cut to a hand in shiny leather (Trinity's?) pointing a pistol across the screen.  Persephone and Merovingian are out of focus in the background.  In the neon-green light of what appears to be the club, Trinity swings a pistol in her hand, setting its muzzle on Merovingian's forehead.  He stands, impassive.  Cut to a close-shorn woman behind a twisted metal barricade grimacing as she fires a double-barreled bazooka.  A black woman with a wedding ring (Zee?) covers her ears and ducks down next to her.  This, I guess, is part of the defense to an attack on Zion.  Cut to a human ship hurtling past surrounded by octopus-shaped sentinels.  The sentinels seem to be pouring in through a side of a cavern, or possibly a hole punched in the side of Zion's fortifications.  There are swarms of them everywhere.  Cut to Morpheus and Niobe at the controls of a swooping ship.  Morpheus strains in his seat as Niobe flies the ship.  Morpheus may be targeting some kind of weapon.  Cut to two humans in large "mecha"-style exoskeleton armor walking down a grate near the front gate of Zion.  I'd estimate the things are 15 feet tall, no different than those seen in  Reloaded   Cut to a view from a ship cockpit as a sentinel attacks.  Cut to some kind of explosion rising up inside a round concrete structure through a metal structure.  Cut to Morpeus appearing from behind a column with two assault weapons raised.  He begins firing both.  Cut to Trinity and Neo in a big kiss.  Cut to wounded armored fighter yelling as he faces what looks light an unbeatable enemy.  He's probably making a last stand against sentinels.  Cut to sentinels moving in swarms, from left and right, down, and toward the camera.  Quick cut to Seraph bringing two pistols up near his head and re-clenching them.  This is probably the completion of the earlier snippet where he picks up the pistols.  Cut to Trinity kicking masked/hooded SWAT guy in the face.  He's standing, not attached to the ceiling.  He's also wearing some kind of collar around his neck and a similar item on his arm.  Cut to Morpheus in a club scene - some kind of S &amp; M club?  Morpheus appears to be taking a man trying to fire a gun at him and turning him upside down so that the guy fires away from Morpheus.  Cut to Trinity running to embrace Neo in a suit, feeling seems to be "Oh, you're alright! Thank God!"  Cut to Morpheus and Link with lights on walking through what looks like a wrecked building whose walls are still partially standing.  Cut to a ship going over a number of standing figures.  I think the "standing figures" are actually the towers of the human harvesting "fields."  I think so because in the background walking "vehicles" can be seen patrolling or harvesting the "fields."  Cut to Neo seen in a building through a hole punched in the brick exterior wall and several interior rooms' walls.  The camera rushes in on Neo.  Neo, seen from behind now, straightens and jumps upward, revealing the hole (through which we just saw him) just in time to avoid the onrushing Smith.  Smith, sneering with his hands raised like claws, flies directly at the viewer.  END WITH GREEN MATRIX TEXT: MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, to the beat of drums.  So, what will we see?  Here are my speculations:  There will be a sentinel invasion of Zion.  It will probably kill many, many humans, as they will be utterly outmatched by the sentinels.  The giant hulking Gigeresque bugs are factories/breeders of the new, ultra-deadly sentinels that look more like fish than octopi.  A final, climactic faceoff between Neo and Smith will probably determine whether Smith, the cancer on the Matrix, kills Neo and all humans outside Zion.  Neo wins, of course, but is fatally wounded.  Neo will figure out a way to kill the sentinels at the last minute, after killing Smith, before he dies (Somehow Neo's ability to stop one dead at the end of  Reloaded  has to be relevant to this movie).  Whether Neo wins or not will matter a great deal to the machine/program world as Smith threatens their existence too.  There will therefore be a "revolution" of sorts in the machine world and the good machines will join forces with Neo &amp; Co.  There will be a big fight scene involving Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph in an S &amp; M club.  Trinity and Morpheus going back to Merovingian and Persephone for more information.  Smith will kill the Oracle by finding her somehow.  A new oracle-like program of some kind will talk to Neo.  There will be a final return by the ship captains to save Zion.  Most will be killed, including Niobe's boyfriend Commander Whatsisname and Niobe and Morpheus will live happily ever after.  Trinity, on the other hand, will have to live with the death of Neo.  We'll see the outside world, the human harvesting arrangements there, and maybe the crew of Nebuchadnezzar seeking information on the surface of the Earth.  There will be a big fight between the downloaded Smith and the guy on the ship reading the data whose face you don't see in the trailer.

       CHEMICAL ALI CAPTURED    urlLink Remember this guy?   Remember how he was killed by U.S. bombing?  Well,  forget what you heard.   urlLink He's alive and has been captured .  Remember that other guy, oh, what's his name - Saddam?  Yeah, he wasn't killed by U.S. bombing either.  He's still out there, and as long as he isn't captured or dead people fear him.  All this reminds me again that no matter how much we wish for antiseptic war, American air power can't do everything we want it to.  Bomb a bunker to smithereens, we still don't know if the guy supposedly inside was killed.    We need soldiers on the ground, and  urlLink we might just get some peacekeeping troops from India, Pakistan and Turkey by going to the UN  Security Council and actually negotiating with others who may wish to commit troops.  Finally.  It's been a bit ironic up to this point: the Bush Administration is so insistent on having everything its way in Iraq that in fact we don't have enough troops to actually keep the country under our control.    If we aren't going to expand the U.S. military, we can't be successful alone.  I mean,  urlLink James Dobbins says  we need 300,000 to 500,000 troops, and there are only 161,000 soldiers there now.  How many are needed to do the job right?  I'm not sure, but almost everyone outside of the White House or DOD says "more than are there now."    I would support a long-term increase in numbers of soldiers to support U.S. missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, which I think will be long-term commitments for the United States.

       SCO IS SMOKING CRACK   Linus Torvalds is  urlLink interviewed in eWeek about the SCO Linux lawsuit .  This article sets out rather simply and clearly why Linux code isn't covered by SCO's copyrights.  According to Torvalds, SCO's alleged offending code is either historical Linux code, BSD code, or only identical with SCO's copyrighted Unix because it complies with public standards.   Torvalds was asked whether SCO could be right in its claim that there are either so many lines of code that are infringing, or infringing and non-infringing code are so intertwined, that makes removal of that code impossible.  Torvalds' response: They are smoking crack. Their slides said there are [more than] 800,000 lines of SMP code that are "infringing," and they are just off their rocker. The SMP code was written by a number of Linux people I know well (I did a lot of the SMP IRQ scalability myself, personally), so their claims are just ludicrous. And they claim they own JFS [journaled file system technology] too. Whee. They're not shy about claiming ownership of other people's code while at the same time beating their breasts about how they have been wronged. So the SCO people seem to have a few problems keeping the truth straight, but if there is something they know all about, it's hypocrisy. Yeah.  What he said.

       MEARSHEIMER'S GLOOMY PREDICTION   Right now I'm reading John Mearsheimer's  The Tragedy of Great Power Politics  and was interested to see him in a  Newshour  interview last night along with Tom Friedman and Ralph Peters.  I don't agree with everything in  The Tragedy of Great Power Politics , but Mearsheimer is always a provocative guy.  I remember that he supported containment rather than invasion as the proper course for Iraq, but I didn't think his conclusions about American involvement in Iraq were so gloomy.  Here's how he ended the interview: Well, I think the idea that a great power like the United States is going to come across the Atlantic Ocean and invade and occupy and create an empire in the Middle East is again delusional.  The history of the 20th century is littered with fallen empires, the British Empire, the Dutch Empire, the French Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian Empire and even the early American empire.  One of the principal lessons we should have learned from the 20th century is that great powers cannot occupy and create empires in the Arab and Islamic world. And we made a huge mistake going in there earlier this year and there's no way we're going to get out without paying a god-awful price.  So, the big idea seems to be that we can't project American power that far away effectively and we're going to get stuck in a quagmire in Iraq.    Well, that's certainly provocative.  I'm not sure what I think of this position.  I'll update once I think about it some more.

       THE SOURCE OF THE BOMB   Yesterday on the BBC I heard a British terrorism expert say that the truck bombing appears to have required a certain amount of expertise.   The type of expertise that Al Qaeda and few others have.  This made it seem like Al Qaeda involvement was a strong possibility.  But the FBI appears to disagree.   Special Agent Thomas Fuentes, examining the blast site, told AP  urlLink We believe it (the bomb) was made from existing military ordnance. . . . I cannot say that it required any great degree of sophistication or expertise to create . Rather than hidden in a cement mixer as previously supposed by the U.S. government, the bomb is believed to have been driven in by a suicide bomber on a Soviet KAMAZ flatbed.  Anthony Shadid, who really seems to have the most interesting stories coming out of Iraq, has an  urlLink audio piece for the  Post  , in which he says that the attackers used a 500 pound Soviet-made bomb and nearly 1,000 pounds of mortars, artillery shells, grenades, tearing down a protective wall and penetrating 3 floors of the hotel the UN used as its headquarters.  All this evidence indicates less need for Al Qaeda's bomb-rigging expertise than access to heavy Iraqi military munitions.  I would like to know more about the proliferation of weapons into civilian hands.  Everybody and their mother seems to have access to RPGs over there, but to what extent have Coalition forces been able to maintain control of heavy weapons?    I don't know, but I assume that U.S. and British forces have locked up Iraq's old heavy weaponry and civilians are effectively denied access to Saddam's arsenals.  I also assume that Special Agent Fuentes was right in saying that this weapon was an Iraqi weapon, not from Syria, who I believe also had Soviet military assistance.  That may or may not be true, depending on whether you believe the rumors that Iran and Syria are trying to disrupt efforts at rebuilding Iraq.  If both these assumptions are true, I believe there are only two ways that these weapons could come into the hands of the attackers:    Knowledgeable ex-military people could have broken in and stolen weapons from Saddam's arsenals they knew were there.    The attackers could have obtained the weapons from Iraqi ex-military types who saved these weapons for a rainy day.  I think that in either case, knowledge only people with military experience could have was necessary to get these weapons.  That leads me to believe that Baathists were behind this attack, acting either alone or in concert with Islamists, because Islamists could not have procured these weapons without help.

       PATRIOT ACT DEFENSE   I saw Georgetown Law Professor Viet Dinh on PBS's  Newshour  tonight promoting the USA Patriot Act.  Now that Attorney General Ashcroft is out defending the Act, it's not suprising Dinh would be on PBS to do the same, even though he's gone back to Georgetown.  Dinh was one the Act's principal authors.    Dinh sparred with Laura Murphy of the ACLU.  While there was a little bit of rancor between the two, Dinh was more subdued than I'd seen him in similar defenses of the Patriot Act.  I'm not a fan of the Patriot Act, and there were a few weak spots in Dinh's argument.  After Murphy brought up the numerous resolutions expressing concern with the Patriot Act, Dinh said the states' and localities' complaints were not condemnations of the Patriot Act, just expressions of concern that it be applied constitutionally.    Murphy came after him on that, breaking the normal question-by-question decorum, saying that a couple resolutions condemned the Act and its application.  I think Dinh then said that the DOJ isn't using the USA Patriot Act to violate the Constitution or suggesting that states or localities use it for that purpose either.  That wasn't a great response, as the next thing raised was the DOJ Inspector General's report that said DOJ was misusing the USA Patriot Act.  Dinh called those violations "regrettable," I think, but to me the point was made.  Dinh, Attorney General Ashcroft, and others are promoting the USA Patriot Act as a preemptive strike against terrorism, and Americans should trust that the Act won't be misused.  But DOJ's IG found misuses of the Act that are hard to ignore.    Should Congress do nothing?  Those implementing the USA Patriot Act have occasionally misused the Act.  If continued monitoring shows misuse won't happen should we give them another chance?  Well, to me, trust of government isn't a powerful constitutional value.  The executive branch has a duty to implement the Constitution, but there is a countervening need here to fight terrorism, and overzealousness is reasonably possible.    I think Congress isn't out of line to be interested in checking excesses in enforcement of the Patriot Act or trying to eliminate unpopular provisions.  In fact I'm happy Congress is concerned enough to act as a watchdog on the Act's enforcement.   UPDATE:   urlLink A transcript of the interview  is now up at PBS.  See if it says what I thought it did.

       ANOTHER SKELETON FOUND   The body of another girl found near Enumclaw last week  urlLink has been linked to the Green River Killer .  The guy who almost certainly is the  Green River Killer, Gary Leon Ridgway, may actually escape the death penalty through a plea bargain.  Why?  For helping find bodies and resolve the Green River killings for the families.  That despite reportedly saying "not all of them are mine,"  one of the least   exculpatory exculpatory statements I've ever heard.  I remember being creeped out by the Green River Killer all the time when I was a kid.  A serial killer in Washington, my home state?  But I read today that  urlLink Washington has actually had a number of serial killers .  Is there something about the area that makes it easier or more attractive to serial killers?  Relatively low buildup outside of major population centers?  Do cloudy skies leave few moonlit nights, making it harder to see such crimes take place?

       THE BIG QUESTION: RESPONSIBILITY   The UN Headquarters building bombing in Iraq.  I first wanted to jump and say that this terrorist act was the action of international terrorists,  i.e.,  Al Qaeda.  But then I thought again.  It could be Baathists, angry Sunnis, it could be Shiites, a resurgent Ansar al Islam . . . the list goes on.   urlLink Juan Cole discusses who might be behind the bombing .  The bombing was, according to witnesses, the work of a suicide bomber.  Would that indicate international terrorist connections?  That might seem reasonable, but then you remember Saddam's Fedayeen, who recklessly went to attack American soldiers as they pushed through towns on their way to Baghdad and were slaughtered.    Could this bombing be the responsibility of the same bombers who attacked the Jordanian embassy?  The Jordanian embassy bombing puzzled some, as would a UN bombing.  I would be seriously concerned if the different attacks in the past several days in Iraq could be linked.  A number of soft targets have been attacked. A water main, an oil pipeline too long to guard, the Jordanian embassy, the UN building here . . .   Was the  urlLink attack in Israel  coordinated with the bombing in Iraq?  It appears not; that bombing was claimed by Islamic Jihad as a response to Israel's killing of a senior Islamic Jihad operative.  So at least this isn't a signature "multiple bombing" by Al Qaeda.

       WHO WAS BEHIND THE TRUSTEESHIP IDEA?   Though the trusteeship idea now seems moot with a peace deal being announced, who floated the idea remains unclear, at least to me.  The August 16  urlLink  New York Times  article  discussing trusteeship in Liberia makes it seem like the idea was a trial balloon being floated by UN Special Representative Jacques Paul Klein.  A journalist from IPS even quotes an unnamed African diplomat  urlLink  as saying : "I think Klein is floating a trial balloon to see which way the wind is blowing" Not that I would trust that diplomat, or for that matter, Thalif Deen, who wrote the story, seeing as the unnamed diplomat goes on to say: "He [Klein]probably wants to run Liberia the way he did Bosnia and Eastern Slovenia." Klein was  urlLink Transitional Administrator for the UN  in  Eastern Slavonia , a war-ravaged part of Croatia.  Slovenia is in the Balkans, but it's hard to confuse the two.    Other stories quote Klein as dismissing the idea of trusteeship in Liberia.   urlLink This article  in the  Christian Science Monitor  says  "Some observers suggest establishing a UN trusteeship to rule and rehabilitate the country - an idea the UN special representative, Jacques Klein, rejects."  urlLink This  Reuters  article  even quotes Klein directly rejecting the idea of trusteeship: Various proposals have been mooted to end Liberia's spiral of violence, among them to make the country a U.N. trusteeship until a stable system of government is established.  But on the fringes of the Ghana talks, U.N. Special Envoy Jacques Paul Klein poured cold water on the suggestion.  "I'm not really happy about that idea. That suggests that we are starting from tabula rasa, from scratch," he told Reuters.  "There are talented and able Liberians in the diaspora, some of whom I have personally worked with. With the right kind of technocrats, you don't need Liberia to become a U.N. trusteeship," added the former U.S. Air Force major-general. So where did the  New York Times ' article come from?  Was this trusteeship idea a trial balloon being floated by Klein? urlLink Tim Weiner's article , bylined Monrovia, says "international officials, diplomats and aid workers here."  Weiner also seems to have talked to UN officials, plural, about this idea, and when the article was written, Klein was in Accra, Ghana.  These aspects of the article make it seem like Klein is not the sole source of the article.    But Klein's shadow seems to loom over the article - it is based on discussions with UN officials, but names none.  The article has information on Klein's background and experience in the Balkans.  The article seems to have been a very well-designed trial balloon that allowed Klein to appear an impartial arbiter in Liberian peace negotiations.  I wonder if Klein didn't talk to the  New York Times  in order to put pressure on the parties to agree to power-sharing before international support grew for international administration that would take away local politicians' and rebel groups' power.

       INSTANT KARMA'S GONNA GET YA   Watching CNN I saw that  urlLink Phoenix, Arizona has recently had very short supplies of gas  because a pipeline broke between Tucson and Phoenix nearly a week and a half ago.  Just like Basra, Baghdad and other parts of Iraq have had fuel shortages.  And of course there was the recent pipeline sabotage.  After electricity blackouts in the Northeast, people in Iraq were saying "now you understand how things are going for us."  Iraq has had only intermittent power in a number of areas.  Most recently there has been a water main break that shut down water for 2/3 of Baghdad until today.  So does the karmic connection between the U.S. and Iraq mean that there will soon be a loss of water to a major U.S. city?

       TRUSTEESHIP    urlLink This article  in the  New York Times  seems to say that Jacques Klein, the United Nations special representative for Liberia, supports trusteeship for Liberia.  Or at least the former American major general and diplomat is floating a trial balloon for this idea.  Trusteeship would mean control by the international community not for an interim period, as in most UN rebuilding projects, but indefinitely - until Liberians are able to run their own country.  Interestingly, some amount of foreign administration in Liberia  urlLink isn't a new idea .  I came across a  urlLink September 1922 article  on this point in  The Atlantic  in looking up " urlLink trusteeship in Liberia " on Google.  Trusteeship certainly sounds better than setting up a local democracy that would fall like a house of cards once foreign troops leave.  When I think about whether Liberians would support this, I think of their election of Charles Taylor as president.  To me this indicates that Liberians are interested in security first and democracy second.  If international administration could be shown to bring real improvements in the lives of Liberians, the people of Liberia would probably accept it until their country has stabilized enough for sustainable democracy.  Trusteeship instead of interim administration seems like a positive step rather than a negative one, despite its association with colonialism.  For example, the international community effectively has interim administration forever in Kosovo, but doesn't admit this and won't resolve Kosovo's end status.  By comparison, trusteeship - international control until a country or region is ready for self-rule - seems more honest.  An internationally trusteeship would mean international control until countries have changed sufficiently from their degraded states to justify self-rule, which is the way it really works anyway.    Would the U.S. leave Afghanistan or Iraq if those countries weren't ready for self-rule?  No.  The U.S. won't leave Afghanistan or Iraq until those countries are ready (unless they become military or financial burdens we won't bear, but that's beside the point).  But we aren't being honest with ourselves about the long-term nature of our commitment to these countries.  The Bish Administration won't make specific plans about leaving and won't inform Congress of the full cost of occupying Iraq so that it can be budgeted.  The United States is effectively involved in those countries until they are improved to a level that satisfies American security needs.  That level is probably functioning national-scale government and functional market democracy, which is in line with the requirements of trusteeship  At least an international trusteeship would be an honest contract between failed developing states and the West: you've failed to rule your country effectively, so we will.  But we won't give up on you until you're ready to stand on your own two feet.    In order for there to be international trusteeship in Liberia, the international community would have to work around the UN, because  urlLink Article 78  of the UN Charter doesn't allow member states to enter trusteeship.  But that kind of adhockery probably suits the Bush Administration, which would probably have to be involved in rebuilding Liberia.

       A LITTLE VIRAL MARKETING   When I was down in Dupont Circle writing up  urlLink my post on Ollie Fries  I saw a box out of which people were picking up CDs.  Somebody had scrawled "TAKE ONE" in blue pen on the side.  There were actually DVDs in cheap paper-and-cellophane covers inside, all with this message written on the top, as if with a Sharpie: DVD BOOTLEG  SICK!  "SIN EATING" SCENE  FROM THE MOVIE THE ORDER At first, I actually thought that someone had written this message in marker on each one, but it was the same on all the DVDs.    I took the "DVD BOOTLEG" home and checked it out.  On it is a 3 minute, 5 second clip with running clocks on the top and bottom, probably counting frames.  At the top of the grainy picture is the tag "PROPERTY OF TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX."  This is probably to enhance the illicit "bootleg" quality and drive viral marketing.  The clip showed an odd kind of exorcism performed by a young non-priest, watched by a man in a collar I recognized as Heath Ledger.    After all the mystical ritual details (runic writing, chanting in Greek, etc.), the non-priest said "I forgive you" and a demonic thing rose from the bedridden guy's chest and was swallowed by the non-priest.  What jarred me, as a Catholic, was that the non-priest said "I forgive you."  It seems that he wasn't expelling demons but rather forgiving sins.  Forgiving sins is something for the Church to do, on behalf of God, and once sins are absolved, they certainly aren't swallowed by the absolving priest.  Having some guy take your sins upon himself hasn't happened since, well, Jesus had himself nailed to a cross.    The clip ended with some mildly disturbing hallucinatory images following the swallowing of the guy's "sins."  Interested, I went to the  urlLink Yahoo! Movies  website for  urlLink The Order  and read a bit about it.  Seems like the movie is about an investigation by a young priest into the phenomenon depicted in the "bootleg" clip, which is bad news because it seems somebody figured out a way to break the church's sole control over the forgiveness of sins [ urlLink Matthew 16:13-19 ].  I'm guessing it sets off a cascade of apocalyptic events, evil actions by rogue Opus Dei wannabes, and clueless investigator Heath Ledger figures it all out and stops the world from ending.    So, yeah . . .  My guess is that if you're a big freemason/trilateral commission/papist conspiracy nut or saw that movie  Stigmata , you'll love this . . .  As viral marketing, this was pretty good.  A decent number of people picked up the DVD, some of whom probably wouldn't see trailers for the movie in theaters.  Dupont Circle on a Friday night was probably a good location so people would pick them up, and the "sick" tag probably helped Fox or their marketers let adults know not to show the clip in front of kids.  I took the clip home, watched it twice and looked up the movie online.  I had zero awareness of the movie before, and now I'm certainly interested.  Good job Twentieth Century Fox.

        THE SECRET OF OLLIE FRIES   Ollie's Trolley is one of my favorite spots to eat in D.C.  I've had most everything on the menu over the years and it's all good, but Ollie's is most famous for its spice-covered Ollie fries.   I hadn't been to Ollie's in about a year and I wanted to figure out what was in Ollie's spices that made those fries so good.  Oh, and I needed an excuse to get out of the house, so this seemed like a great idea.    I headed down to Farragut North and got to Ollie's just before 6:00 - closing time.  I hadn't been there in more than a year, but nothing had changed.  I ordered a cheesesteak, Ollie fries, and a Sprite. $8.00 of greasy glory.  Eating at Ollie's doesn't fit into any diet I know of, but everybody needs to eat like this every so often just to break the monotony of eating things like oversteamed broccoli and soggy pasta with sauce from a jar.  As I stood at the counter after ordering, I noticed a small handwritten paper sign near the fryers saying "home of the world famous Ollie Fries" and remembered why I was there: to figure out what made the fries so tasty.     So I asked the owner what spices they put on the fries.  He told me it was a mix of 24 different spices, though not surprisingly he didn't mention what they were.  I asked him if he had come up with the spices himself.  He said his uncle actually came up with the spice combination more than 50 years ago.  The recipe was something his uncle came up with at home, and its popularity with family and friends was the impetus for starting the original Ollie's (which was actually in a trolley).  He said things like burgers, fries, and cheesesteaks came later.  I don't know when they added tabbouleh and the rest of the Lebanese menu, but I'm pretty sure the owner's family is Lebanese.  The owner said McDonald's started out with seasoned fries like Ollie's (obviously that's now changed).  Quite the interesting factoid.  I wasn't surprised that McDonald's quality had slipped over the years, probably because of cost.  He said that he spent $6.00 for every pound of the spice mix.  I'd guess that's probably a lot more than he spent on the potatoes the spices are put on.    Ollie's greasy-spoon uniqueness is really what makes it great.  The place is decorated with handmade signs offering all sorts of deals.  One I noticed was a marker drawing of a guy in a jacket and backwards hat with an enormous clock around his neck like Flava Flave of Public Enemy.  The reason for the sign: a discount on orders of small fries after 5:00pm.  That sign has probably been on the wall since Public Enemy first made it big.  I asked my brother Gabe, distinguished chemical scientist (erm, electrical engineering grad student) that he is, if rigorous scientific analysis would help me figure out what Ollie's put on their fries.  He said it would take a large sample to do an organic chemistry-style analysis, more than I could get from an order of fries.  So I decided a little amateur eyeballing of the spices themselves was the best I could do.    I took some time in the park at Dupont Circle to watch the poker players and chess games, listen to a DJ play reggae for no one in particular, and analyze my sample - leftover fries from Ollie's.  Here's what I believe are the ingredients:  sesame seeds;  red pepper flakes;  salt;  poppy seeds;  some kind of long thin striped seed like anise;   another thin seed, but smaller and brown;  rosemary;  paprika; maybe cumin;   black pepper;  green pepper seeds (not hot, so probably not Jalapeno seeds);  some small round tan/brown-colored seeds.  Well, that leaves only about 15 more spices to figure out and I've, um, inadvertently destroyed my sample.  If you're interested in figuring out why Ollie's fries are so good, I'd advise you make an independent investigation down at Ollie's Trolley, 1426 L Street, NW Washington D.C.

       POWER OUTAGES and T*****ISM   Everyone is being careful not to mention the T-word in association with the power outages, but I'd bet this event has sparked terrorists' imaginations.  The  Washington Post   urlLink is saying that :  "the problem was caused by an outage at a Manhattan power plant that destabilized the power grid about 4 p.m." The  New York Times   urlLink is saying that :  "the trouble started with a fire at an upstate power plant . . . [b]ut there were conflicting reports about whether the plant is in the region of the Central Hudson utility or in Niagara Mohawk's territory. If all it takes to cause this kind of massive, cascading power failure is a fire in an upstate power plant, why wouldn't terrorists try to set one?  You have to wonder what the result of this blackout will be for electricity deregulation.  Major power sharing and regional interdependence in power grids is probably at least a partial cause of the power failure - will Congress want to take steps to limit power sharing, or will this problem just be forgotten?    Maybe I'm being too cynical, but I don't think there will be a major policy response to this disaster  because there appear to have been no deaths and no one is panicking , especially in New York City, site of the 9/11 attacks.  No hospital closures, no deaths I've heard of, nothing but people being forced to walk home.  I think we'll be just as vulnerable to this sort of power failure, whether accidentally or intentionally caused, 5 years from now.

       VICTOR BOUT   I just saw an interesting Ted Koppel   urlLink Nightline   interview with two experts on arms dealing, in light of the recent  urlLink FBI missile sting .  They both talked about  urlLink Victor Bout , a  urlLink former Soviet Air Force and KGB Officer  who has sold and  urlLink ferried  arms  urlLink all over the world  (both legally and in violation of sanctions, apparently) Bout has sold arms to both the Northern Alliance and Al Qaeda.  He has remained unpunished because he has been protected by political connections, at first  urlLink in the United Arab Emirates , recently in  urlLink Russia , and now in Ukraine.    By comparison, who did we pick up in this recent sting?  This guy sounds like a small fry who was helped in this sale by the FBI, he doesn't seem like somebody who'd be otherwise able to buy and sell weapons.  Forget this guy.  Lock him up, of course, but go after the big guys like Victor Bout whose arms sales actually matter in the war on terrorism.   UPDATE : The latest  New York Times Magazine  apparently has a profile of Victor Bout, though it  urlLink isn't online yet .  There's also a  Financial Times  article saying the latest arrest indicates greater Russian cooperation on arms dealing.  I wonder if that new cooperation could reach out and get Victor Bout.  The speakers on  Nightline  didn't trust Leonid Kuchma to cooperate on arms trading issues, and that's a big moneymaker in Ukraine.  So I doubt even greater cooperation with Russia will lead to the arrest of the most notorious Russian arms dealer.   UPDATE II : The   urlLink New York Times Magazine  article ,  Arms and the Man  is now up.  It's a great story.  Shady arms dealings that seem impossible without government support, mafia enclaves, friendships with dictators, and Victor Bout is just the tip of the iceberg.  Reading this, I actually felt afraid for Peter Landesman, the reporter who wrote this story.

       AFGHAN FLYPAPER   I just realized something about the flypaper thesis which is being debated anew in bloggerland (e.g.,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) after a  New York Times  article about increasing numbers of Islamic militants in Iraq.  My belief is that the flypaper thesis is actually valid in  Afghanistan .   urlLink Bagram Air Base  and other American bases are frequently under rocket, mortar and rifle attacks, and the U.S. retaliates against those who try to attack its bases with troops and air strikes.  If the U.S. is able to retaliate effectively, it could eliminate some Al Qaeda or Taliban supporters or members.  Nobody important, certainly, but the flypaper thesis does seem to work to some extent in Afghanistan.

       D.C. UNITED WIN!   Went to a D.C. United game tonight with tickets won in Monday's pub quiz at downtown Irish bar Fado.  My seat was OK, but I had no trouble moving down to a better one.  Bobby Convey, D.C. United's great young guy, was transferred to Tottenham Hotspur and there was a ceremony giving him a signed jersey.  While it's bad to have United lose Convey, giving an American international player a chance to play in the English Premier League is a very good thing.  Especially based on the level of play tonight - there were some real groaner passes.  Not that I wouldn't dream of being half as good as those guys.  I wish Convey the best of luck.    D.C. United scored in the first half, Colorado had a shot rocket off the post, and United was able to hold off Colorado's efforts at offense in the second half.  It was fun to watch, I just wish there were more people there.  I hope MLS will become profitable some day.

       INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING OUTSIDE KABUL   NATO has just taken over responsibility for peacekeeping in the Afghan capital, but security in Kabul isn't the real problem in Afghanistan.  Regional warlordism and a resurgent Taliban are much bigger issues, but no member of the UN Security Council is pushing for an extension of peacekeeping forces into the hinterlands.  Why not?  I think no one wants to contribute troops to such a mission, and raising the issue would put the onus on the complaining member to put its money where its mouth is, figuratively speaking.  But the Security Council can't deny what is happening in Afghanistan is harmful to international interests and not helping Afghanistan become an independent and viable state.  61 dead in militia clashes and bombing the other day.  As  urlLink Matthew Yglesias  noticed recently, resurgent Taliban are reasserting their power.  While we cringe at the death of two soldiers a day in Iraq, I fear that people are forgetting just how dangerous and important the occupation of Afghanistan is?  If the members of the Security Council let Afghanistan fester, we'll just have deal with another disaster there, and people will wonder why didn't do anything in 2003.

       PORT OF MONROVIA LOOTED WHILE U.S. FORCES WATCH   CNN says  urlLink U.S. Cobra helicopters circled above  as locals stripped the port of appliances, vehicles, furniture, and anything else they could take - including food bags marked "made in the USA."  Haven't we seen this before?  Say, in Iraq?    To be fair, the rebel group in charge there (LURD) didn't do anything to stop the looting, and probably was participating, to get a last shot before the port of Monrovia is secured so aid can be brought into the country.  But why couldn't the U.S. and ECOWAS (Nigeria) figure out that the port was insecure, just waiting to be looted?  I think it's because the Nigerians aren't crossing rebel lines and the U.S. is probably even less interested in sending troops to face looters than it was in Iraq.  UPDATE: 200 U.S. Marines are to land Thursday and operate as a rapid reaction force backing up the Nigerians; only some will remain overnight.  They are supposed to free up Nigerian soldiers at the airport so the Nigerians can take control of Monrovia's port.

       ANSAR'S RETURN?   After Ambassador Bremer made the point of saying Al Qaeda-tied Islamist group Ansar al-Islam had risen from the dead (U.S. Special Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga routed them during the war), it appears the  New York Times  made a point of looking up the veracity of that claim.   urlLink Neil MacFarquhar's story , "Rising Tide of Islamic Militants See Iraq as Ultimate Battlefield" outlines some of the few details known about the surreptitious return of this group - several Iraqis, a Palestinian, and a Tunisian were arrested recently, it is believed that 150-odd Ansar members have recently returned to Iraq, and Ansar's spiritual leader has called the struggle like that of the mujahideen in Afghanistan.  Then the story adds parts about the bombing of the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.  The story says that the attack on the Jordanian embassy was likely the work of militants.  What I would be careful to say is that the militants that attacked the Jordanian embassy are probably  not  from Ansar al-Islam.  Ansar operated primarily in Kurdish areas, as the article implies but does not clearly state, and an operation in Baghdad by that group is, in my view, unlikely.  In the embassy bombing we may be dealing with an Islamist threat, but it is more likely a central Iraqi, non-Kurdistan-based group behind that attack than Ansar al-Islam.   urlLink This article  from the  Sunday Times  of London says that a new group further south in Iraq, Jaish Muhammad, blending Al Qaeda leaders and Iraqi foot soldiers, has launched sophisticated attacks against American targets, but this story isn't being widely followed.  If it were more than just rumor the  New York Times  would probably have printed something about that, at least I hope they would have.  The article does state the right numbers - there are only a couple hundred Ansar members probably still able to undertake operations, and we know little of any other Islamist threat, but with more than 9000 people fighting a guerrilla war against the U.S./UK occupation, these Islamists seem less a rising tide than a drop in the ocean.   UPDATE:   urlLink The U.S. military  is  in fact focusing on Ansar  in investigating who was behind the Jordanian embassy bombing . . . . maybe because Ansar was involved in car bombings near its former enclave in northern Iraq.

       IT ALL GOES BACK TO LIBYA   Today's story: Libya will finally admit what has long been known: that  urlLink it was behind the bombing of Pan Am 103 , the flight that crashed into Lockerbie, Scotland.  Apparently a deal will soon be reached to resolve the long-running dispute over this claim.  Though Qaddafi seems to have changed his ways somewhat more recently, Libya back in the day was certainly a state sponsor of international instability.  Consider  urlLink this story  in the  Washington Post , which details the connections that Charles Taylor was able to make, using which he may still be able to influence Liberian and regional politics.  How were these connections made?  In rebel training camps in Libya.    You see, this is what happens when you allow states to sponsor terrorism and foreign freedom fighters.  It allows these states to foment instability and extend influence without needing military reach into areas where the trained rebels fight.  That's why we have to take out groups like the Taliban.  Iran might seem like another good candidate, but nobody seems to be able to take out the conservative clerics in Iran without destroying the rest of Iranian society.  Sgt. Stryker  urlLink has a post detailing  why Iraq under Saddam was a state sponsor of terrorism, mostly taken from an Administration list of reasons.  I don't buy some of these, some aren't directly terrorism related, and I would like a lot more information on others.  I trusted the Administration once, on WMD, I wouldn't want to burned again if I agree with them that Saddam sponsored terrorism to the extent outlined in the Sgt. Stryker post.

       SAN/MS BLASTER/WINDOWS UPDATE VIRUS   Until I talked to someone earlier today, I had no idea there was a virus rampaging around, infecting Windows machines and making it impossible to start the machines.  She had a problem with her computer - it presented all the signs of this virus apparently.  I wondered why I didn't get it, and there were two apparent reasons:  I use Windows ME, a piece of junk the virus makers didn't take the trouble to try to infect.    I constantly update my Windows software with patches - I check more than once a week, usually.  See  urlLink Slashdot   for the entire story.  The interesting idea floating around with this is that the virus will target Winsdows Update websites around the world this weekend, though I have no idea whether that's true or not.  Good luck avoiding this and other variants of last year's "Code Red" virus that are  urlLink very likely to crop up  in the future.   urlLink Here 's a  Washington Post  story on how to fix the problem.   UPDATE [8/13/03]:   On a lark, I decided to go to my local  urlLink Windows Update website .  The connection was  very  slow, even though I was using a university LAN.  The site did eventually load, however.

He was convicted of wire fraud and will be sentenced next year.  How sad.

       CLERKS: DON'T MISS THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY   If you ever watch  Clerks  on DVD, be sure to watch the movie again with the Director/Cast commentary on.  In addition to some information on the making of the movie and good information on low-budget movie-making in general, the commentary is hilarious because it's just a live audio feed from one night during the making of  Mall Rats .  Jason Mewes, a.k.a. Jay (and Silent Bob) is very obviously drunk and stoned during the audio commentary, and chimes in with incomprehensible mutterings occasionally and everybody makes fun of Jay for being so out of it.  It's hilarious, so don't miss it if you get the DVD.

       OLLIE'S TROLLEY SPICES   I constantly troll through my few hits and try to figure out what it is people are looking for when they come to my site.  It looks like a good number of people are looking for information relating to Ollie's Trolley, a great D.C. restaurant.  One of the most recent hits was from a search for  urlLink Ollie's Trolley's spices .  So, being responsive to my blogging public, I have decided to venture down to said Ollie's Trolley restaurant soon to once again sample the fries - perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday.  I will report back with what I believe to be the ingredients of the the famous Ollie Fry spices.

       MORE ON CAIN: JAMES M. CAIN AND  THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE    I saw  urlLink  The Man Who Wasn't There   a few years ago and enjoyed it.  Since then, I've read a number of noir stories, including some by Raymond Chandler and most recently James M. Cain.  Now I realize that  The Man Who Wasn't There  was a tribute to Cain.  It took elements straight out of different Cain novels.  One such element was the scene in  Mildred Pierce  in which Billy Bob Thornton takes a girl he thinks has musical talent to a foreign music teacher, who says she is terrible.  The movie has an ending similar to that in  Double Indemnity , in both the novel turns out to have been the confession of a man who had been tricked and couldn't get away with murder.  The very notion of the man who wasn't there, a sort of non-descript protagonist who isn't really in charge of his own destiny, who commits crimes that seem to him perfect but are easy to unravel, is a Cain archetype, though Thornton's character at least worked in a barber shop rather than a gasoline station/garage/eatery.  Basically, I have one more reason to love the Coen brothers.    By the way, I saw a trailer for  urlLink  Intolerable Cruelty   before  Seabiscuit  yesterday - it looks like Joel and Ethan Coen took on the romantic comedy genre this time, and from the trailer the movie seems better than most romantic comedies.  If you need a date movie in October, this is probably a good bet.    Oh, and Billy Bob Thornton is in this one too.

       MILDRED PIERCE   This  urlLink James M. Cain  novel wasn't great, but it did have some high points.  First was the character of Veda, who was a great example of true evil - not the fake evil of Dracula or Aliens or something like that, but a real evil person.  Unfeeling, haughty, inherently manipulative . . . and a memorable character.  The novel was too long and didn't have enough true drama.  I imagined that this novel could have been a tight 75-page novella, but instead it's stretched out over a few too many years of the Depression.    The book jacket quotes  urlLink Edmund Wilson  as saying that Cain is "a poet of the tabloid murder" and   urlLink Mildred Pierce   fits that description well.  The book doesn't have elements like murder, drifters, or wild animals, but at the end of the story, Veda absconds to New York and a new career as a virtuoso opera singer.  The tabloid angle here would be a later story detailing the sordid details in the background of Veda Pierce, the famous singer.  And in this tabloid story, the details are true.

       SEABISCUIT   I've just come back from seeing   urlLink Seabiscuit   at the Uptown, D.C.'s finest movie theater.  I enjoyed the movie; it was often touching and had that kind of drama you only find in real life.  At times, however, it tugged a little too hard at your heart-strings.    The movie also felt a little bit like a PBS documentary, which might be because I  saw  a documentary with Laura Hillenbrand about the book on TV a while ago.  However, there was also voice-over narration by author  urlLink David McCullough , who has done narration for a number of PBS documentaries (including Ken Burns'  Civil War ).  There were also PBS-like black-and-white photos and radio clips interspersed with the live action.    One character that I didn't like was  urlLink William H. Macy 's goofy radio announcer, whose sound effects-related antics were just there for cheap laughs.  I don't blame Macy, the character was just annoying.  The character of "Howard (the owner)'s wife" was also cardboard-thin - mostly she just reacted to whatever Seabiscuit was doing on the track.  I laughed to see that Howard's rich rival Riddle dained to allow ordinary folks onto the infield at the "classy" Pimlico racetrack in Baltimore.  How far the mighty have fallen.  I went to the Preakness there a few years ago: the neighborhood is horrible and the infield is full of drunken pot-smoking white trash and women showing their breasts to the applause of the crowd.  I hardly even knew horse races were going on.  And my final, and most important question: do jockeys  really  have time for all that dialogue in the middle of a race?  It seemed like Tobey Maguire and the George Wolf character chatted up a storm in the saddle.

       WAS MEETING IRAN-CONTRA ARMS DEALER A BIG DEAL?  The  Washington Post  is making a big deal of " urlLink an unplanned, unscheduled encounter"  with an Iran-Contra arms dealer, Manucher Ghorbanifar, in Paris.  The article cites a number of previous meetings with people working for Douglas Feith.  Secretary of State Powell complained these meetings were unauthorized and State Department staff were apparently surprised to hear of the latest meeting.  No big surprise no one at DOD let State know about this, but I don't know if this story merits the front page of the  Post .  The real story, the unauthorized meetings, happened in 2001 and 2002 and despite Powell's complaints, Feith wasn't fired and none of his staff were either.    The latest meeting, if actually an "unplanned encounter" doesn't seem like a big deal to me, though  urlLink Juan Cole  thinks it is part of a pattern of actions by Feith that amount to a personal foreign policy and subversion of the Constitution.  I'm not sure whether that's true or not, I'd want to know how much freedom guys like Feith have to seek information without approval from the President.  This seems primarily to be information-gathering, so a bit less dangerous than other types of contacts, and it happened last year.    I'd like to know more about the nature of this unplanned, unscheduled encounter.  That wording seems too well chosen.  It makes it seem like this encounter involved bumping into Ghorbanifar, but is carefully worded to say that wasn't really the case - though unplanned, this sounds like a full sit-down meeting.  My take is that this meeting isn't as bad as Cole characterizes it, if any shakeup should have happened, it should have happened last year.  If it didn't, then President Bush has essentially sanctioned the 2001 and 2002 contacts with Iranians (with whom meetings have occurred off and on, I would bet at significant lower-level bureaucratic initiative), this meeting seems honestly unplanned, and not informing the State Department about it this time around is regrettable, but not surprising given the bureaucratic infighting between DOD and State.  Basically, this isn't a big deal.

       NORTH KOREAN SECURITY GUARANTEES  Remember how the Bush Administration wasn't going to sign a  urlLink non-aggression pact or treaty  with North Korea?  Well, that's still true.  Sort of.  It appears that the Bush Administration  urlLink may get Congress to pass some kind of resolution  that will take note of the Bush Administration's intention not to attack North Korea.  This sounds like a pretty laughable guarantee and I doubt the North Koreans would take it if they really want a security guarantee.   [If the President doesn't sign a joint resolution, it doesn't mean much]  But the North Koreans may actually not be looking for a real security guarantee.  They may just be looking for a propaganda coup in which the United State would bow to the DPRK leadership in some fashion, so that their population would be wowed by the international stature of their leaders.    I say this because I think back to the  U.S.S. Pueblo  incident, in which the North Koreans eventually released the American ship's crew after a very weak and unenforceable apology by the United States that was only useful for domestic propaganda purposes.  I say go for it, but if the North Koreans want a real security guarantee, they probably won't bite.

       WHAT SHOULD BE THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE JAKARTA MARRIOTT BOMBING?  The Marriott bombing will certainly hurt Indonesian tourism and foreign investment, which will in turn harm Asian economic recovery and thus American economic well-being.  How's that for a domino effect?  And if Jemaah Islamiyah could pull off an attack like this, I would wonder if they or another Al Qaeda affiliate can't hit Kuala Lumpur or Singapore, which would be another great blow.  So what should the United States do?  The U.S. should move most directly to counter the economic loss.   Australians are already involved in the law enforcement effort.  The U.S. needs to give aid to Indonesia - economic aid, not military aid.  Indonesia is facing a domestic terrorist threat and is still siding with the United States against militant Islam, and for that, Indonesia should be compensated economically.  Direct economic aid would probably not be enough.  An American free-trade agreement or a drop in economic barriers to Indonesian goods that could help the Indonesian economy would be better.    What's interesting is that a recent free trade agreement with Singapore may allow Indonesia to piggyback on Singapore's free trade agreement  urlLink to whatever extent the U.S. is willing to be lax in enforcement .  That's a lot easier for the Bush Administration than passing a new trade agreement with Indonesia, and this "independent sourcing" looophole could be exploited immediately.  What seems clear to me is that the major bombing-related economic loss will come in tourism and is unlikely to be made up in that sector because fear of travel to Indonesia seems rational in light of the Bali and Jakarta bombings.  Therefore, the U.S. will have to do what it can to promote growth in other sectors, and I think relaxing economic barriers is the right answer.

       KIDS IMPERSONATING LAW ENFORCEMENT    This story is hilarious -  urlLink a kid in Warrenton, Virginia dressed up as an FBI agent , complete with sunglasses, FBI jacket, and earpiece brought another kid into a convenience store to ask the store clerk to identify the "suspect."  But, the story also has a   horrible   ending.  What sounds like a pretty funny prank (I would have loved to see these guys try to pull this off in person) ended with these guys charged with real crimes.  Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

       LOOKING FOR TROUBLE  I've known for a little while that I need to find a new apartment, and I've been looking at a few possible places to move.  One place I thought of in the District was the area around Adams Morgan and Mount Pleasant, though I really hadn't looked at anything.  It seemed near fun things to do (Adams Morgan), near possible places to work, and still reasonably priced.  In addition, the area has a lot of Salvadoran immigrants, so I'd have an interesting neighborhood.    But I didn't know exactly  how  interesting it would be.  I was watching the news one afternoon a few days ago and heard about a shooting on an alley off Columbia Rd, which runs through that area.  That sounded bad.  Then I heard it was gang-related.  Gang-related?  That sounds even worse.  I did some poking around on the Internet and found that there has been a spate of shootings recently, in addition to several long-running feuds, between Latino gangs in D.C. and out in Northern Virginia and in Maryland.  Apparently the most recent round of shooting grew out of a fistfight between members of Mara R and the 1-5 Amigos.    What did I do next?  Something kind of dumb.  I thought, well, I should check it out to see if it's as bad as people say.  I wondered if I could move into a good part of the neighborhood, and I also wanted to see Meridian Hill Park, which is supposed to be nice.  So I took the Georgetown - Dupont Shuttle and walked up the hill, through Kalorama and Adams Morgan and onto 18 th  Street.  At first, it seemed totally fine, even interesting.  The ordinary stores were playing music in Spanish and Moms were pushing strollers down the street to the market, where ads for odd stuff like coconut milk were on the outside windows.  I thought it was exotic and would probably be cool to live in the area.  Then as I walked along, a guy walked in front of me, tattoos poking out from under his baggy clothes.  He stopped and talked with all the young guys parked on the curb who were just hanging out.  All right, I thought, this is still cool.  These guys looked kind of tough, but I didn't know anything about them.  So I kept going.  I walked up to 16 th  Street and turned into Mount Pleasant.  There the neighborhood wasn't as cool, and the guys started staring at me.  I think I was getting "the look."  You know, "white guy, what're you doing here?"  But I just kept going down the street, nice and casual, checking out the storefronts, some of which were OK and others of which were pretty run down.  I turned off onto the side streets and it was an odd transformation - the side streets were full of large, nice houses that didn't seem to match the rundown storefronts.  I walked back a bit on the side streets and then turned on Irving and crossed 16 th  Street.  I had heard that Meridian Hill Park was between 16 th  and 15 th  Street, so I went on to 15th Street.    I was getting looks there too, and there were lots of guys just hanging out on the street with no obvious place to go.  I passed a small patch of new pavement where I saw the number "1" superimposed on the number "5," which made me jump a little bit - was I on the turf of one of the gangs that had recently been involved in this shooting?  That wouldn't be so hot.  I realized that 1-5 Amigos probably meant some association with 15 th  Street, so that wasn't entirely unreasonable.  I kept walking until I got to the park.  Meridian Hill Park was a nice open park, but it does need a little work.  The grass is pretty beat up and the turf is missing in large patches.  I went down the hill and the fountain is off; guys who looked to be repairing it were on their lunch break.  The trees were nice, but the park looked like it could use some serious sprucing up.  I left the park and walked a couple blocks to 18 th  & U Streets, then back down to Dupont.  I wonder whether I really should have done that.  On the one hand, I think,  would anybody mess with me, the white guy?  The shootings have been gang-related, and I don't look like I'm going to belong to any of the Latino gangs in the Mount Pleasant area.  Then again, I felt pretty out of place and if somebody had bothered me, I really didn't know what would have happened.  The neighborhood didn't seem entirely welcoming.  So the gist is probably that I won't move anyplace where I won't blend in walking down the street, and I probably wouldn't blend in well in some parts of the neighborhoods I just walked through.

       U.S. LIMITING RAIDS IN IRAQ - BUT WHAT ABOUT SADDAM?   urlLink Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez  says that the U.S. is going to limit the scope of its raids and change its methods of search - less blowing down doors, more cooperation with neighbors and local tribesmen.  What I wonder is how this jibes with  urlLink the search for Saddam .  One aspect of this search has been raids in which numerous people are arrested who are suspected of harboring Saddam Hussein.  The intent of these raids has been to destroy Saddam's support system.  Are American soldiers now going to knock and play nice when dealing with those hiding Saddam?  Can the U.S. really expect any measure of cooperation from Tikritis in capturing their favorite son?  I consider this pretty doubtful.

         BRING ON THE FIRING SQUAD!  Amrozi,  urlLink convicted today  of carrying out last year's Bali bombing, will be executed  urlLink by firing squad .  Interestingly, of the 14 men on the firing squad, only one will have a live round in his rifle.  Utah, the only U.S. state to still use execution by firing squad, uses a 5-man firing squad, but 4 of the 5 have bullets in their rifles.  I wonder what the justification for the 1 to 13 ratio is in Indonesia?  Does it decrease the likelihood that any one member of the firing squad will be sought out for retribution by the deceased's vengeful relatives or co-conspirators?  The trial seems to have been an odd spectacle.  While Amrozi smiled as the guilty verdict was announced, he didn't seem to have a sympathetic audience - the courtroom cheered his death sentence.  The death sentence for Amrozi, a relatively low-level conspirator, virtually guarantees that the other Jemaah Islamiya members being tried for their parts in the bombing will also be sentenced to death.

       THE FLYPAPER THEORY  There's a theory out there, or a hypothesis anyway, that an American presence in Iraq draws Al Qaeda-style militants to Iraq and allows the U.S. to neutralize them, much like flies getting stuck on flypaper.  At least I've seen it called the flypaper theory.  I would rather call it the "buglight" theory, because I think buglights are more attractive to bugs than flypaper, and then there's that satisfying zapping and frying of the bugs.  But I digress.  I was studying for the bar rather than blogging at the time, but as I understand it, this position really came to be noticed when President Bush stated that Americans weren't discouraged by attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, ending with the terrible sound bite, " urlLink bring 'em on ."  I guess there were two ideas bound up in this - first, that we wouldn't be deterred by guerrilla-style attacks on our soldiers, and second, that we want those who oppose American troops in Iraq to confront American soldiers so the Americans can kill or capture them.    The troubling thing to me is the emphasis we get from Paul Wolfowitz and the other neocons inside and outside the Bush Administration on the foreign and Al Qaeda elements of the guerrilla resistance, who call the current low-level conflict in Iraq the " urlLink central battle " of the war on terorrism.  This seems to me a deliberate attempt to confuse attacks on American troops by criminal thugs and Saddam loyalists with the larger (and more popular) war on terrorism.   There are, of course, a good number of foreign fighters infiltrating the country to attack Americans.  However, they are a small percentage of the total.   Juan Cole  (who very graciously responded to an email on this subject over the weekend), suspects that only a couple hundred of the 9,000 guerrillas CENTCOM estimates are fighting American troops in Iraq are actually volunteer Jihadis.    While Americans are subject to attacks that terroristic in nature, to say that we are fighting organized Arab/Islamic terrorism in Iraq distorts the true nature of the conflict there.  It allows Americans to draw misleading comparisons between the fight in Iraq and the war against those who committed the September 11 attacks and their adherents.  Such overhyping of the connection between the guerrilla conflict in Iraq and the war on terrorism will serve the Bush Administration no better than the overhyping of Saddam Hussein's attempts to beat nonproliferation controls.  If and when the occupation of Iraq draws large numbers of foreign Jihadis to attack Americans in that country, it may be justified to say we are fighting the larger war on terrorism there.  But at this point, we are not actually faced with that kind of threat.  The war in Iraq seems to have been two things for the Bush Administration: an attempt to change the strategic balance in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, and an attempt to create an Arab and Islamic society with liberal, democratic values as an example for the rest of the Arab and Islamic world.  As for the first issue, while changing the political balance of the region is important, this can only be considered part of the war on terrorism in a very indirect way.  The roots of terrorism are societal, not strategic, - resentment of privileged members of unjust societies and repressive regimes, distaste for globalization and liberal or "western" values (among other things).  As for the second issue, the creation of a liberal Iraq, our engagement there seems insufficient to guarantee safety and security, let alone a good constitutional arrangement or free and fair elections.  What I fear isn't foreign militants entering Iraq and attacking American troops, but rather the social dislocation, crime, and chaos in Iraq.  This can create the same kind of pessimism, resentment and anger about Americans that fuels terrorist organizations in other parts of the Islamic world.  In addition, our failure to properly occupy, control, and rebuild Iraq may create another failed state where terrorists can find support and hiding places.  I am afraid that rather than becoming a terrorist-importing state we can use as "flypaper" to destroy terrorists stupid enough to fight American soldiers, occupied Iraq has a much greater potential of becoming a terrorist-exporting breeding ground for terrorists itself.

       SOME CATHOLIC GOINGS-ON IN THE NEWS  As a Catholic, I always notice the stories about Catholicism that make the news.  Recently there have been two stories I've been following:  The pope telling Catholic legislators to oppose gay marriage, and Republican complaints that their conservative nominees to the federal bench are not being confirmed because of their deeply-held Catholic beliefs.   The Pope's statements followed the the Supreme Court's decision in   Lawrence v. Texas  , which brought down one fundamental basis of American discrimination against gays - the illegality of homosexual sex.  With that chain broken, many wondered what rights gay people would be able to now achieve.  The press began discussing gay marriage or civil unions as a distinct possibility.  And into the middle of this debate comes the Pope, saying that  Catholic legislators must oppose gay marriage .    I have no problem with the Church taking positions on issues and I am personally against the full-on gay marriage position.  But I have always disliked papal diktats that we are to ignore church-state boundaries or any distinctions between morality and public policy.  Such statements are what made Americans wonder whether we could have a Catholic president who would not be bound by the moral/political guidance of the Vatican.  These kinds of statements can lead to the misunderstandings of Catholic belief partly at issue in the Estrada and Pryor nomination battles.    What I mean by that is, the Republicans say that Democrats will not confirm these nominees because of the nominees' deeply held beliefs,which includes opposition to abortion because they are Catholic.  This position is a straw man and Democratic Catholic senators have been angered by the use of this approach to the nomination battle.  I don't like the idea being propagated that Catholics in government, even judges, will ignore the law or the public good in order to advance the positions endorsed by their faith.  This is incorrect, as both sides are clear to say as they argue sanctimoniously over which side's Catholics were wronged.    However, the Pope's command to Catholic legislators to fight gay marriage sure doesn't help make it clear that Catholics in government won't be subjected to undue moral influence because they are members of the Roman Catholic Church.  So he should lay off.  That's my big take on the big Catholic issues.  As for the other big gay issue, the Episcopal bishop issue, I guess I'm just too Catholic here.  We don't have married clergy.  So any kind of sexual relations by clergy just doesn't work for me.  And a gay relationship for a bishop is certainly off the charts.  I would support a gay Catholic priest or bishop, and I'd much rather have the man be out than closeted, but clergy should be celibate, no matter what their sexual urges.

       THE U.S. SHOULD MAKE THE TRADE WITH IRAN  Ah, Iran.  Despite its hatred of the Great Satan, the Iranian government always seem capable of making deals with the United States.  In the 1980s it was the Arms for Hostages deal and Iran-Contra scandal.  Now the  New York Times  reports  urlLink Iran is holding  Saif al-Adel and other Al Qaeda members, possibly including Saad bin Laden and Suleiman Abu Geith, and apparently wants to trade them for Mujahedeen Khalq members in Iraq.    This is a great deal.    This is like trading Ichiro Suzuki for some over-the-hill AAA player with sentimental value to the other team.  The U.S. should jump on it now, before the deal has a chance to fall through.    What's interesting is that some "United States official" leaked this certainly classified information to the  New York Times .  That probably means his side is losing the argument over this trade.  Why would that be?  Maybe Bush Administration people want to keep the Mujahedeen Khalq around so they can be used to destabilize the Iranian regime in Cuban exile fashion.  Doesn't seem that smart to me, as the real energy for change in Iran doesn't seem to be coming from groups like this.    The U.S. should take Adel, bin Laden, and Abu Geith.  The Iranians have probably exploited them for all the intelligence they have of value, so the U.S. should try to get the Iranians to share at least some information so the U.S. doesn't have to waste its time.  That may or may not happen; I have no idea how intelligence-sharing on Al Qaeda has gone with Iran.  After interrogating these guys for a few months (somewhere besides Guantanamo would probably be a good idea: keep them away from their followers), the U.S. should try these guys.    Of course, having just taken the bar, I would wish the Administration would try these guys in federal court.  Unlike Zacarias Moussaoui, who seems to have actual defenses to the crimes with which he is charged, these guys will probably not be that hard to try.  But, these men would also be ideal candidates for those military tribunals the Bush Administration keeps insisting it will use.  If the Bush Administration wants to use its military tribunals, it should trade the Iranians for these guys and put them in the dock.

      I just saw  urlLink this post  over at CalPundit.  Basically, it says Dean's going to run ads against Bush in Texas.  Though it's like trying to kill a giant with a peashooter, as a Democrat I love the attitude, and that wins Dean points with me.    What turns me off about all the candidates out there is that none of the others would do something like this.  None of them would walk up to George Bush and tell him to his face, "you're wrong."  They'd do the classic Washingtonian, "I agree, but . . ." and that's why they'll all lose.   They have to put themselves in stronger contrast to President Bush if they're going to beat him (unless political realities change  urlLink like they changed against Bush's father ).  If the Democrats don't get to do it by taking positions strongly contrasting Bush's, they'd better do it with their rhetoric and their actions.  Dean is the only one of all the candidates who really seems to get that.

         WHAT  WAS   DONE WITH SADDAM'S SON'S BODIES   Well, the U.S. didn't put Saddam's sons in hidden graves somewhere, per my suggestion.  Instead the U.S. allowed them to be  urlLink buried in Saddam's birthplace  by his tribesmen.  That does make some sense, as these people wouldn't worship Saddam any less if his sons were buried anywhere else.  But having these graves in the family cemetary  does  make it easier for others to make a Baathist hajj to their gravesite.   urlLink This article  in Australia's  The Age  noted the controversy over the length of time it took to bury the men - Muslims are supposed to be buried on the day they die - and that U.S. efforts to retouch the bodies to prove the sons' deaths are also contrary to Islamic norms.    Well, as for the length of time, I think there is good reason why the U.S. didn't have the two buried immediately, and I wouldn't call Uday and Qusay great sons of Islam.  As for the retouching of the bodies, I would think Iraqis and other Arabs would be  more  suspicious about the bodies' being Uday and Qusay once they were retouched by U.S. military mortuary specialists.    On second thought, I bet Iraqis and other Arabs would be suspicious no matter  what  was done to the bodies.

       CURRENT EVENTS FUTURES  I'm so glad that Congress made a big deal out of killing DARPA's Policy Analysis Market (or whatever the exact name was).  Because that kind of thing already exists outside of government,  urlLink right here , for example.     People willing to pay money for these kind of bets probably know something.  But isn't the big problem imperfect information?  Can guys who do these kinds of things really know enough insider stuff to bet in a knowledgeable way?  You really have to wonder.

       BIG PLANS  I'm planning a big trip and I don't know if I'm even going to be able to do it.    Ah, the things you do with your time when you have nothing to do.  I spent a significant part of the day yesterday reading trail reports and planning a trip to the Skyline Trail, a big, wild traverse above the Quinault River in the Olympic Mountains of Washington.  This is the one that got away, the hiking equivalent of that gigantic bass the guy at the diner is always talking about in movies.  I've hiked all over the Olympics, and this is the one place I really want to go.  And I don't even have enough money to buy a ticket home right now.    So I called up my brother, woke him up, asked him when he'd be able to go.  He said after the 23 rd .  "Great," I said, "Oh, and Happy Birthday."  I let him go back to sleep.  I called my Dad, got his work answer machine.  Said I'd call tonight. [Never actually called]  I read the trail reports.  They all said there were tons of bugs, the way was impossible to follow after the first few cairns, there's tons of snow, ice axes are necessary in places, the trail goes up and down and up and down again, you have to wade a river, and the approach has lots of blown-down trees.  Sounds great.  Then I looked up some flights on the Internet.  Beeee-ooh-wee-oooh.  The internet's up.  I open up four windows: travelocity, cheap tickets, expedia, orbitz.  After looking at a couple flights on each of these sites I soon have twenty windows open and I'm stretching my computer's memory to its limits - you know, the point at which fonts don't work right any more and you can't click between sites easily?  I find a great flight.  $305, National to Sea-Tac.  I look for dates on the calendar-thingie the site's got.  No flights on my dates, or the next three, or the previous three, and so it goes, until about two hours later I realize I can get flights for $320-$340 at about the end of August until the beginning of September, which is about ideal - there'll be enough time for the snow to all melt that'll melt, I think.  Then I think my Mom will want to see me.  So I guess I better lengthen the trip.  I then realize I've been on the couch all morning in my bathrobe and it's 1pm.  I peeled myself off the couch like a piece of velcro and showered.  I even went the extra mile to shave so as to feel like a proper human being.  I went down to take care of an insurance thing and bought some stuff at Safeway.  Salsa material.  I came home and made the salsa.  Rudimentary stuff, I just sort of guessed what'd go in there - roma tomatoes chopped up about the right size, most of an onion, a bunch of cilantro.  I cut up a lime in eighths and squeezed the juice into the mix.  It tasted all right, but I didn't eat it.  I had decided to go running.  One of the trail reports about the Skyline Trail emphasized that "You cannot be in good enough shape."  I've been running for a few months now and have lost a good 15-20 pounds.  I like it somewhat; the running definitely gives me more energy and a sense of accomplishment, which is always good to have.  But I realized I'm going to have to pick up the running to get in good enough shape to survive the Skyline Trail.  Plus every bit of weight I drop is weight I won't have to carry up a mountain.  So I took this crazy route up north in a drizzle, running up to Van Ness street on the trails and then cutting over to a trail I'd never taken before, along Melvin Hazen creek - you're basically running alongside this stream that goes down a ravine, and then suddenly there's Connecticut Avenue.  The trail got even steeper on the other side, but it was nice scenery.   By this time I'm sweating like crazy and my shirt weighs 100 pounds from the sweat and the drizzle.  I tried to squeeze it out, but there was no way to fix the problem.  But I'm not taking off the shirt until I have the washboard abs.  So basically never.  So I ran down the hill to where the trail came up alongside Rock Creek and then I ran on the hill on the side of the river, which was pretty steep and I swore I was going to fall off the hill after tripping on some roots.  I cruised along the trail for a while til it crossed the Creek, and I ended up on Beach Drive, running in a tunnel somewhere near the National Zoo.    I ran down to Whitehaven/Dumbarton Oaks cutoff and headed up the hill, promising I'd be done once I got to the top, and I'm telling you I was.  I walked up the hill to my apartment and I'd been running for more than an hour and a half.  I was sweat-soaked and burned out, but I felt good.  Maybe if I run like that every day and don't eat a half-tub of ice cream like I did an hour later I'll be in shape for the Skyline Trail.  Now if I could just afford a ticket.

       FOCUS ON AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ?  I always love reading Phil Carter's  urlLink Intel Dump , where I saw his interesting post on how troops are stretched thin globally, especially between Afghanistan and Iraq, and focused on the inflexibility in supply of Army units with specialties in " urlLink civil affairs, MPs, Military Intelligence, and others necessary for nation-building. "   And the post makes me wonder, which is more important to win, Iraq or Afghanistan?  Of course we need to win both, but I think success in Iraq is more important.  Why?  It  is  important to clean out rats' nests in places like Afghanistan, Sudan, or Somalia, but those states are largely peripheral.  Our true enemy is the terrorists, not those who support them, and the terrorists we are most worried about are Arabs.  The societies that produced the foot soldiers for Al Qaeda and will produce more for its follow-on and subsidiary organizations are mostly Arab societies.  So what we do within Arab lands is what matters most now, even if in my opinion, invasion of Afghanistan was a much smarter venture than invasion of Iraq.

       WHAT TO DO WITH SADDAM'S SON'S BODIES  Is anybody wondering what'll happen to Uday and Qusay's bodies?  My vote is to treat them like the Ceausescus - bury them in unmarked graves (though their graves were discovered).  The U.S. should get a couple of its Muslim chaplains to give the brothers a proper Muslim funeral (you know, to arrange for their souls' prompt arrival in hell for all their sins against the Iraqi people) and then bury the bodies in a large cemetary with the headstone "Hussein" - that is, if that's consonant with Muslim burial practices.  While the U.S. should keep track of the graves' location, this information shouldn't be released.  Don't let local neo-Baathists of a few years from now have shrines or bodies they can place in Lenin-style mausoleums.    And Question Number 2: would we execute Saddam?  If we catch him, we've said we want him tried, Nuremberg-style, before the Iraqi people.  But if he's convicted, would Saddam face the death penalty?  Most of the world disagrees with the death penalty and UN Tribunals dealing with the most gruesome crimes give out only life sentences.  Personally, I would like to see Saddam rot in solitary confinement as long as the U.S. is able to guarantee he will stay there, but if the U.S. will not be able to assure adequate security to keep Saddam in jail for the 10 or 15 years until he probably would die, the U.S. should execute him.    The question then is the same as for the sons - what do we do with Saddam's body?  Secret burial, or allow his grave to become a shrine?   UPDATE: [08/02/03]  I just saw Salam Pax's July 30  urlLink  Guardian  column  , which included a Baghdadi's statement, which would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad, that: proper burial for these two is to dig a hole somewhere in the desert and have the family look for them for years. That, of course, is what many Iraqi families have had to do because of Saddam's Stalineque mass murders, and it seems like rough justice for Saddam and his family.

       FLYNT FOR GOV., TRAFICANT FOR PREZ   I just noticed Josh Chafetz of  urlLink Oxblog  asked which "is more pathetic: Larry Flynt running for California governor or James Traficant running for President?"  I'm all for answering others' rhetorical questions, so here goes: Jim Traficant is more pathetic.  Larry Flynt is a crazy smut peddler, but he has helped the cause of free speech through vigorous action in the courts.  Jim Traficant presided over the collapse of Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley and was one of the worst members of Congress ever, which is a hard title to gain, believe me.   They are both interesting personalities, I wonder which one I'd rather meet?   Oh, and by the way, Crimetown, USA (which Chafetz mentions) is a great story - a good friend of mine is from Youngstown, Ohio, and after reading that story I asked her and her family all about Jim Traficant, corruption, and the mob.  It is a very interesting, rotten little city.

      I'm watching  urlLink Oregon upset Michigan  right now, with  urlLink Keith Jackson  announcing.  Keith Jackson noted several times that Michigan had no more time outs in the last couple minutes of the game, but consistently called them "  times out  ."  Is that normal for people of a certain generation?  For people who speak English more properly than I do?  Or is it just Keith Jackson?    A couple times during the game Jackson seemed to be channeling  urlLink Dennis Miller , calling the game "Runyonesque" rather than "Kiplingesque" because of its crazy see-saw nature.  Sounds like "times out" is something peculiarly "Keith Jacksonesque" to me.

      Reading  urlLink Instapundit , I saw  urlLink a blurb  from  urlLink this Michael Barone column  about U.S. media impatience, murmurs of quagmire, and general sniping about the conduct of Iraq's reconstruction.  Barone makes some valid points.  There is a tendency in the media to amplify the bad and not mention the good.  While we constantly read and hear about Falluja, a "Sunni Triangle" town full of resistance to American occupation, we don't see many articles about towns like Diwaniya,  urlLink where the occupation has been relatively positive .  Barone also writes that, in historical perspective, Iraq's occupation is not going as badly as it is commonly portrayed.  Barone mentions the fumbling negotiations at the end of World War I documented in   urlLink Paris 1919   and Douglas MacArthur's and Lucius Clay's lack of planning and preparedness for postwar Japan and Germany, respectively.  These are certainly very relevant examples for the Iraq situation.  But Barone's historical perspective seems incomplete to me and his column left me thinking,  haven't we learned anything about occupation and reconstruction since the end of World War II?     I think we have.  While improvisation may have been necessary for MacArthur and Clay, I think a lot of thought has been given to reconstruction over the last 50 years.  The U.S., Europe, the UN and the rest of the world have had to deal with postwar situations everywhere from Latin America to Southeast Asia, especially in the last 10 years.  There are significant amounts of experience and knowledge out there relating to aid, counterinsurgency, policing, and reconstruction, among other things.  If our government had decided to do it, the United States could have had significantly better plans for the occupation of Iraq than it had for its post-World War II occupation efforts.   And I believe that would have resulted in a clearly better occupation than the one we are facing now, even if the occupation isn't going as poorly as commonly portrayed.  We could have protected the right buildings in Baghdad, better controlled the proliferation of weapons in Iraq, and better transitioned from an army that that propped up Saddam Hussein's army to one that defends Iraq's people.    Our poor postwar planning is a strategic error Barone can't explain away through recourse to history.

      The storm started exciting enough - there was a light drizzle when I went out to run this morning, and a lot of people at the grocery store when I got there at 8:30 am to buy some essentials.  But this early suspense faded as the day went on.  Wind blew in the trees outside, the lights flickered mildly and the rain poured, but there were no fireworks, nothing I hadn't seen before.  There was a lot of buildup with newsmen nearly being bowled over as they broadcast live from storm-wracked cities on the coast of Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia.  But the storm in failed to live up to the hype in upper northwest D.C.     I give this storm 1 star ( * ) out of 4 ( **** )   UPDATE  [9/20/2003]: There was a lot more damage than I noticed at first.  There are trees down everywhere, most horribly for me across my beloved running trails.  I ran there this morning and it was like hurdles at first and bad cross-country hiking later.  My running last night was mostly in the dark as many street lights and traffic signals are out.  A friend in Maryland has had her power and water out for two days and could have no power for another week.  There is still standing water in Alexandria.  So I revise my earlier review, as follows.  I give this storm 3 stars ( *** ) out of 4 ( **** )

      Let's think about consequences.  So the Cancun Ministerial collapsed.  And the Round deadline of January 2005 apparently  urlLink  won't be met .  I'm starting to think that we're going to enter a long period of relative stagnation in trade negotiations, basically because of rising rhetoric and the fact that we've come down to a number of hard issues on which countries don't want to be flexible, even if it hurts them economically.  So if we're in a period of stagnation, what does that mean?  I think it could be good for Howard Dean.  Let me explain, if I can.  Dean  urlLink wants to extend first-world labor and environmental conditions to the developing world  and to prevent the hollowing out of America's core and the export of American jobs.  He's a "fair trade" supporter of the American protectionist vein.    The G-21 and other developing country groups are "fair trade" supporters of a third-world variety.  They want deals that drastically reduce Western protectionism and it looks like they aren't willing to take much less.    My thought regarding Dean is this: if the G-21 aren't going to negotiate except on terms that are politically unpalatable even to free traders, a protectionist fair trader like Dean won't feel pressure to compromise for the economic benefit of trade and gets the political benefit of never selling out the UAW, American steel companies or American farmers.  And Dean can claim to be on the side of the third world with his rhetoric of extending labor and environmental standards as human rights (even if the G-21 complains that that isn't what they really want).  What a nice rhetorical position.  Now all of this is speculation based on Dean staying consistent in his fair trade position and the Cancun deadlock remaining the long-term status quo.  But it makes some sense, doesn't it?

      In the wake of the collapse of the Cancun talks, USTR Robert Zoellick released a brief statement condemning WTO members who refused to compromise  urlLink 14 September 2003 Statement of U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick  "Whether developed or developing, there were 'can do' and 'won't do' countries here. The rhetoric of the 'won't do' overwhelmed the concerted efforts of the 'can do'. 'Won't do' led to impasse.  "We came ready to work off the first chair's text. Today, we were willing to work off the text prepared by the five facilitators, and we remain willing to work on these items.  "Today we stalled because of the Singapore issues, but the larger lesson of Cancun is that useful compromise among 148 countries requires a serious willingness to focus on work -- not rhetoric -- to attain the fine balance between ambition and flexibility."  Wow.  Now there's a little more emotion than we usually get from trade negotiators, but I'm not surprised, as the failure of Cancun will certainly be a black mark on Zoellick's tenure.    So what's next, I wonder.  Will the WTO now become a forum for North-South economic confrontation?  Now that major trade obstacles are non-tariff barriers like subsidies, I think the game is really changing, and we are probably entering an era of "Singapore stagnation."  I mean, do you really think the EC is about to give up the CAP?  And do you think Latin America is going to stop producing beef or Africa producing cotton?  These are structural clashes that aren't easily resolved.

      Here's  urlLink the WTO's quasi-official writeup on what happened on the last day of the Canc&uacute;n ministerial conference .  In case you're wondering, the phrases "talks collapse," "ministerial goes down in flames," or "pass the tequila" are not to be found anywhere in the text.    Summary of 14 September 2003 Day 5: Conference ends without consensus  The Canc&uacute;n Ministerial Conference ended on 14 September after Chairperson Luis Ernesto Derbez concluded that despite considerable movement in consultations, members remained entrenched, particularly on the "Singapore" issues. 	 Chairperson Derbez, who is Mexicos foreign minister, had held consultations immediately after the previous evenings heads of delegations meeting ended at about 1 am.   He described his consultations at a later meeting with all WTO members and at press conference. He said that because "speech after speech" in the heads of delegations meeting had been about the Singapore issues - trade and investment, trade and competition policy, transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation  his first consultation with a smallish group of participants had been about this group of subjects.  The consultations, which ended at about 4 am revealed that this was the most difficult issue, and he therefore decided that the next consultations, which began at about 8:30 am would start with this subject, he said.  These consultations were with a larger group representing a wide range of regional and other groups. During these consultations positions shifted, allowing the possibility of dropping negotiations on one or two subjects, Mr Derbez said. He then suspended the consultations for transparency, so that participants could meet their respective groups.  But when the participants returned it was clear that there was no consensus and so he decided to close the meeting.  Mr Derbez then reported to the heads of delegations meeting at about 4:00 pm. He proposed a six-paragraph ministerial statement, which was approved in the closing session at almost 6:00 pm. This instructs member governments officials "to continue working on outstanding issues with a renewed sense of urgency and purpose and taking fully into account all the views we have expressed in this Conference."  The ministers asked the General Council Chairman and the WTO Director-General, to coordinate this work and to convene a meeting of the General Council at senior officials level no later than 15 December 2003 to take necessary action.  Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi said there was no hiding the fact that the deadlock was a setback. He said he was disappointed but not downhearted. He said it is important to ensure the negotiations are put back on track. If the Doha Development Agenda fails, the losers will be the poor of the world, he said. He pledged to work hard for a successful outcome.  Mr Derbez concluded that members have to learn from the lack of consensus, that business as normal will not succeed, and that some soul-searching is needed. He blamed part of the deadlock on a failure to move a way from rhetoric - no one can live off rhetoric, he said.  The WTO and its members can still make a difference for he poorest, he said.   1.   As we conclude our Fifth Ministerial Conference in Canc&uacute;n, we would like to express our deep appreciation to the Government and people of Mexico for the excellent organization and warm hospitality we have received in Canc&uacute;n.  2.   At this meeting we have welcomed Cambodia and Nepal as the first least-developed countries to accede to the WTO since its establishment.  3.   All participants have worked hard and constructively to make progress as required under the Doha mandates. We have, indeed, made considerable progress. However, more work needs to be done in some key areas to enable us to proceed towards the conclusion of the negotiations in fulfilment of the commitments we took at Doha.  4.   We therefore instruct our officials to continue working on outstanding issues with a renewed sense of urgency and purpose and taking fully into account all the views we have expressed in this Conference. We ask the Chairman of the General Council, working in close co-operation with the Director-General, to coordinate this work and to convene a meeting of the General Council at Senior Officials level no later than 15 December 2003 to take the action necessary at that stage to enable us to move towards a successful and timely conclusion of the negotiations. We shall continue to exercise close personal supervision of this process.  5.   We will bring with us into this new phase all the valuable work that has been done at this Conference. In those areas where we have reached a high level of convergence on texts, we undertake to maintain this convergence while working for an acceptable overall outcome.  6.   Notwithstanding this setback, we reaffirm all our Doha Declarations and Decisions and recommit ourselves to working to implement them fully and faithfully.

      Cancun talks go down in flames.  Protesters couldn't bring it down, but European and American agricultural subsidies could.    First, as bad as this is, I'm happy we finally see European and American agricultural policies seen as the stumbling block to world trade in dramatic fashion.  I mean, what do you think the third world is producing?  Semi-conductors and accounting firms?  The EU and U.S. need to stop imagining they can create a world trading system with these privileges for western farmers, and I'd like to see the U.S. government forced to trade these subsidies for further trade liberalization in other sectors.  But it'll take a new president, I'm sure.  An administration that'll support steel safeguards to win Pennsylvania and Ohio won't do anything to lose votes in "red" states with large agricultural sectors.    Oh, and if there's going to be change on this score in Europe . . .  I don't know what.

      Below I have a rough translation of what Dominique de Villepin has stated as his government's position on Iraq in  Le Monde .  Here's a quick rundown of what it says:   RISING DISORDER SHOWS THE CURRENT OCCUPATION HASN'T WORKED  After a rise in disorder and terrorism in Iraq, there is a real risk of failure there.  While it's good the U.S. showed openness to bringing in the UN by putting a draft resolution before the UNSC, can the UN act if it's given no authority and its safety isn't assured?  The plan in the U.S. draft resolution won't prevent the breakdown of Iraq.  The coalition hasn't delivered what Iraqis' legitimately expected and has demoralized them.  Iraqis need to be at the center of Iraqi rebuilding.  A RADICAL NEW APPROACH:  RESTORE IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY, REFOCUS COALITION TROOPS UNDER UN MANDATE  France is willing to work with the United States under a radically new approach. Such an approach is necessary for regional stability, because the occupation is leading nowhere, Iraqis are frustrated, and terrorists are taking advantage of the situation.  Iraqi sovereignty must be restored quickly because the foreign presence provides a focal point for Iraqi frustration and Iraqi nationalism is an important force and a counterweight to divisive ethnic and religious politics.  Transferring sovereignty to Iraqis will allow them to make important decisions themselves and feed hopes for a reconstitution of Iraqi society.  Coalition troops should remain, and be under American control.  However, these troops should be given a specific and time-limited UN mandate and the coalition should make regular and detailed reports to the Security Council.  Coalition forces should be redeployed to provide border security and prevent infiltrations.   The forming of an Iraqi National Army and police forces should be accelerated.  This will depend on using demobilized Iraqi forces.  In time, these forces should be able to focus internally, and the Coalition forces externally.  QUICK TRANSITION TO UN-APPROVED PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS  The Iraqi Governing Council should be recognized as agents of Iraqi sovereignty.  Within a short period,  e.g. , one month, a provisional government could be constituted from this basis, gradually giving up executive power, including economic and budgetary control [to a provisional Iraqi government of some form].  A personal envoy of the UN Secretary General would organize consultations between parties in Iraq, the Coalition, and Iraq's neighbors and set up a timetable and modalities for transfer of power to a provisional government.  This timetable would include a constitutional process within which a draft Constitution would be submitted by the end of 2003 and general elections could happen between the end of 2003 and spring 2004.  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO COORDINATE RECONSTRUCTION, MILITARY, ECONOMIC AID  An international conference would be convened to coordinate and restore coherence to reconstruction efforts.  The international community will also have to decide who will contribute troops to UN forces for Iraq and who will take on police and army training responsibilities.  Similar decisions will have to be made regarding economic and other assistance in the reordering of Iraqi administration.  My opinion on these positions:  No kidding the occupation hasn't gone that well in Iraq.  But I'm not sure the immediate solution is to put the Iraqis in charge.  That the Iraqi Governing Council couldn't establish an executive more effective than a monthly rotating position between 9 different people makes it clear to me that a transition won't be easy.  This article makes me think the French government sees self-government as a solution for the security situation in Iraq.  Self-government is only one issue and trying to deal with it in a rushed fashion could cause even more security problems.  I think security should be dealt with independently, with a greater number of U.S. troops to establish security.  Creating a time-based framework for constitutional development and elections seems improper, the decisions should be made based on qualitative criteria, security would be one of these.  I am leery of an international conference to settle reconstruction and aid issues, as it seems to put Iraqi oil contracts back before the UN Security Council, where Russia and more problematically France have vetoes on any resolution that would be the basis of a conference decision.  The conference's settling of oil contracts will come across as a backroom deal, just like the Halliburton and Bechtel contracts - no matter how fairly those contracts may have been awarded, they will never cease being questioned.  The U.S. is not going to go along with a UN mandate with time limits and reporting requirements, especially if the Bush Administration's mantra for Iraq is "as long as it takes."

      On Saturday, Colin Powell negotiated with Dominic De Villepin of France and representatives from other Security Council members at the UN headquarters in Geneva about the occupation, reconstruction and government of Iraq.    The negotiations didn't go far toward mending the rift between the United States and France or the other Security Council members, and Powell left soon thereafter to travel to Kuwait and Iraq.  In articles about the trip, the   urlLink Washington Post   and   urlLink New York Times   both noted that the atmosphere of the talks was poisoned by a Friday  Le Monde  op-ed by Dominic De Villepin about Iraq.    Steven Weisman of the  Times  wrote: American officials are openly irritated with Mr. de Villepin, who wrote up his proposals in a sweeping article in Le Monde on Friday, which was not considered diplomatically adroit as a prelude for meetings that were supposed to be confidential. And Glenn Frankel of the  Post , in a somewhat longer graf, wrote: In an opinion article in the French newspaper Le Monde today, de Villepin called for "a radically new approach" in which the United Nations would effectively take political control of Iraq from the United States, help Iraq establish a provisional government within a month, write a constitution by the end of the year and hold elections next spring.  The current U.S. occupation, wrote de Villepin, "let's be brave enough to say, is leading nowhere. Far from promoting stability, it arouses bitterness, incomprehension and frustration."  But even before he arrived in Geneva early this morning, Powell branded de Villepin's proposal "totally unrealistic." He did not conceal his annoyance with his French counterpart's characterizations, telling reporters on his flight here: "It is easy to toss out nice theories about sovereignty and occupation and liberation and all of that, but as a practical matter, it can't happen in that time frame. We have done too much and invested too much to consider any such proposal."  That must be some op-ed, I thought.  So I went to  urlLink  Le Monde 's website  and looked for an English version of their site (a la   urlLink Daily Yomiuri  ), but I should've known that would be impossible in the land of anti-Anglicization.  So I searched in the "Recercher" box for "Villepin" during the last "7 jours" and found the article.  But I couldn't understand it.  So I went to the old tried-and-true  urlLink Babelfish  for a rough translation.  Below are the text of the original article and the Babelfish translation, with my edits on what appear to be obvious errors.     urlLink ORIGINAL ARTICLE  POINT DE VUE Irak  : les chemins de la reconstruction, par Dominique de Villepin LE MONDE | 12.09.03 | 13h14  L'Irak vient de tourner une page de son histoire avec la chute d'une dictature et l'espoir d'un avenir meilleur.  Pourtant, un enchaînement tragique de désordre et de violence s'est mis en place. Les attentats se sont multipliés. Le fanatisme et la haine ont frappé partout : l'ambassade de Jordanie comme les Nations unies et le mausolée de l'imam Ali de Nadjaf.  Désormais, le risque est réel de voir se perpétuer un engrenage de l'échec, alimenté par l'absence de perspective politique tangible. Cette situation suscite le désarroi des organisations internationales sur place et l'anxiété de tous ceux qui sont présents sur le terrain. Le plus grave danger est celui de la démobilisation et du désespoir du peuple irakien. Seul un sursaut, appuyé par la communauté internationale, peut permettre de sortir de l'impasse.  La responsabilité de chacun est clairement posée.  Le président Bush a marqué sa volonté d'ouverture et nous nous en félicitons. Pourtant, le projet de résolution déposé au Conseil de sécurité ne témoigne que d'avancées encore limitées dans le rôle dévolu aux Nations unies. Nous sommes de ce fait dans une situation de plus en plus paradoxale : peut-on demander à l'ONU d'intervenir davantage sur le terrain sans lui accorder la capacité d'action ni les conditions de sécurité indispensables ? Le projet de résolution peut-il s'inscrire, en effet, dans la continuité de ce qui a déjà été fait ? Est-ce à la mesure de la situation ? Est-ce de nature à enrayer les mécanismes de décomposition en Irak ? Nous ne le pensons pas.  Loin de nous l'idée de minimiser l'ampleur de la tâche et sa complexité, ou d'entretenir l'illusion de la facilité. Mais nous avons une conviction : en poursuivant dans la voie actuelle, nous courons le risque d'entrer dans une spirale sans retour. Le temps est compté. Au lendemain de la guerre, l'administration directe de l'Irak par les forces de la coalition a suscité, en dépit d'efforts soutenus, un malaise persistant dans la population. La remise en route des services publics essentiels, la réfection des infrastructures, s'en sont trouvées retardées d'autant. L'attente légitime des Irakiens a été déçue.  Une autre voie reste possible, plaçant le peuple irakien au cur du processus de reconstruction et faisant appel à la responsabilité de la communauté internationale.  Nous partageons tous le même objectif : établir la stabilité et les conditions de la reconstruction en Irak. La France est prête à travailler au sein du Conseil de sécurité avec les Etats-Unis et les autres pays engagés sur le terrain, pour le bénéfice de l'Irak. Mais il faut sortir de l'ambiguïté qui conduirait à un échec pour le peuple irakien, avec le risque d'un discrédit de la communauté internationale. Cela suppose une approche radicalement nouvelle.  D'autant que c'est l'ensemble de la région qui est menacé. Nous avons tous conscience que le problème dépasse le cadre de l'Irak : c'est la stabilité du monde arabo-musulman qui est en jeu. Au Proche-Orient, l'option exclusivement sécuritaire ne fait qu'entretenir le cycle de la violence et des représailles au risque d'anéantir les perspectives politiques. Cette démarche - ayons le courage de le dire - ne mène à rien. Loin de promouvoir la stabilité, elle attise les rancurs, les incompréhensions et les frustrations. Partout, les organisations terroristes profitent de la moindre faiblesse pour renforcer leur implantation et nourrir une violence qui nous concerne tous.  Comment sortir du piège et créer les conditions de la stabilité en Irak ?  Avant tout, reconnaissons que la présence étrangère constitue en elle-même un point de fixation. Quelle que soit la bonne volonté de chacun, elle cristallise les frustrations, focalise les mécontentements, fausse la donne politique : toutes les parties concernées se déterminent par rapport à elle au lieu de se mobiliser en faveur de l'Irak. L'effort de reconstruction implique que l'on travaille sur des bases claires et donc que l'on fixe une échéance à la période actuelle de transition. C'est la clé de tout progrès.  Il importe donc avant tout de respecter le sentiment national irakien, nourri d'une histoire millénaire et porteur de la stabilité future du pays. A l'inverse, il faut éviter de renforcer les logiques particularistes ou communautaristes.  L'Irak est une terre de mémoire. Son attachement à ses traditions et à son identité l'a déjà conduit à rejeter les tutelles extérieures qu'on a voulu lui imposer. Il en est résulté tout au long du siècle dernier des soubresauts qui ont ébranlé en profondeur le pays. De révolution en coup d'Etat, il n'a pu trouver la paix à laquelle il aspire profondément.  Aujourd'hui, l'urgence est de transférer la souveraineté au peuple irakien lui-même afin de lui permettre d'assumer pleinement ses responsabilités. Alors les différentes communautés trouveront, je l'espère, la force de travailler ensemble. Alors un pas sera fait dans le sens d'une plus grande justice : il appartient, en effet, aux Irakiens de prendre les décisions qui engagent l'avenir de leur pays. Mais c'est aussi affaire d'efficacité : pour les différentes communautés irakiennes comme pour les Etats voisins, seule la perspective d'un destin politique souverain peut alimenter l'espérance et permettre à la société de se reconstituer.  Cela signifie-t-il un départ immédiat des forces de la coalition ? Certainement pas, et de nombreuses voix s'élèvent à juste titre pour souligner que cela créerait un vide pire que la situation actuelle. Ces forces pourraient rester sous le commandement du principal contributeur de troupes. Faut-il élargir leur composition ? L'essentiel, selon nous, n'est pas d'accroître le nombre de soldats sur le terrain, mais de définir pour leur action un mandat précis des Nations unies, limité dans le temps, avec des rapports réguliers et détaillés au Conseil de sécurité. L'une des priorités, notamment, est aujourd'hui la sécurisation des frontières et l'arrêt des infiltrations. Un redéploiement des forces de la coalition pourrait être étudié, en liaison avec les Irakiens, afin de répondre à ce risque majeur.  Accélérons la formation d'une armée nationale irakienne sur le modèle de ce que nous faisons en Afghanistan. Cela suppose de faire appel en partie aux forces irakiennes démobilisées, dont les compétences seront indispensables pour rétablir durablement la sécurité. Le même travail devrait être accompli dans le domaine de la police. A terme, nous pourrions aboutir à une répartition des tâches plus conforme au respect de la souveraineté irakienne et, sans doute, plus efficace : la sécurité extérieure en priorité pour les forces des Nations unies, la sécurité intérieure pour les autorités irakiennes.  Dans ce cadre, et alors que s'ouvre à New York la négociation d'une nouvelle résolution, nous proposons la séquence suivante.  Les actuelles institutions irakiennes, c'est-à-dire le Conseil de gouvernement et les ministres récemment nommés, seraient considérées par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies comme le dépositaire de la souveraineté irakienne pour la période de transition. Dans un délai très court, par exemple d'un mois, un gouvernement provisoire irakien pourrait être constitué à partir de ces instances, et se verrait transférer de manière progressive le pouvoir exécutif, y compris l'activité économique et budgétaire.  Un envoyé personnel du secrétaire général des Nations unies serait mandaté afin d'organiser des consultations avec les institutions irakiennes existantes et les autorités de la coalition et de recueillir le soutien des Etats de la région. Cet envoyé personnel ferait rapport au Conseil et proposerait un calendrier définissant le transfert graduel des pouvoirs vers le gouvernement provisoire et les modalités d'achèvement de cette transition politique.  Ce calendrier devrait prévoir les étapes d'un processus constitutionnel avec l'objectif de soumettre un projet de texte avant la fin de l'année. Des élections générales pourraient être envisagées dès que possible, d'ici au printemps 2004.  La France est prête à prendre dans ce cadre toutes ses responsabilités. Dès lors que la souveraineté de l'Irak serait rétablie, une conférence internationale pourrait être convoquée afin d'aborder l'ensemble des problèmes liés à la reconstruction du pays. Elle viserait à rétablir la cohérence et l'efficacité de l'action internationale en faveur de l'Irak. Dans le domaine de la sécurité, il faudra décider des contributions à la future force des Nations unies ainsi qu'à la formation de l'armée et de la police. De même, il faudra définir les engagements en matière d'aide économique et les modalités de l'assistance à apporter à la remise en ordre de l'administration irakienne.  Tel est le sens des propositions que nous présentons au Conseil de sécurité. Nous le faisons dans un esprit de dialogue avec les Etats-Unis comme avec tous nos autres partenaires. Nous nous retrouverons dès samedi à Genève avec les membres permanents du Conseil de sécurité et le secrétaire général, Kofi Annan, convaincus que la communauté internationale peut construire son unité autour d'un projet exigeant et ambitieux.  C'est un défi sans précédent. Il exige de nous compréhension et adaptation aux réalités du terrain. Il exige aussi que chacun veuille bien oublier les querelles du passé et renoncer aux partis pris idéologiques. La reconstruction de l'Irak est un devoir partagé.  Dominique de Villepin est ministre des affaires étrangères. ARTICLE PARU DANS L'EDITION DU 13.09.03    urlLink TRANSLATED ARTICLE    POINT OF VIEW Iraq: ways of rebuilding, by Dominique de Villepin LE MONDE | 12.09.03 | 13:14  Iraq has just turned a page of its history with the fall of a dictatorship and the hope of a better future.  However, a tragic sequence of disorder and violence  came to pass   was set up . The attacks multiplied. Fanaticism and hatred struck everywhere: the embassy of Jordan like the United Nations and the mausoleum of the imam Ali  de  of Najaf.  From now on, the risk is real to see remaining gears of the failure, supplied with the absence of  tangible  political prospect s   tangible . This situation on the  ground   spot  causes the distress of the international organizations and the anxiety of all those which are present on the ground. The most serious danger is that of the demobilization  [?]  and the despair of the Iraqi people. Only a start, supported by the international community, can make it possible to leave  this impasse   the dead end .  The responsibility for  this [?]   each one  is clearly posed.  President Bush showed  openness [?]   his will of opening  and we are  somewhat  pleased  some . However, the draft Resolution  tabled before   deposited to  the Security Council testifies only to  how [?]   advanced still  limited  in  the role reserved for the United Nations  still is . We are  in   of this  fact in an increasingly paradoxical situation: can one ask  the UN   UNO  to  more intervene   become more involved  on the ground without  him to grant   giving it  the capacity  to act   of action  or the essential conditions of safety?  Does   Can  the draft Resolution  be  register ed , indeed,  as   in  continu ous  ity  with  of  what  h  w as already happened  made ? Is this  commensurate  with the  measurement of the  situation? Is this likely to stop the mechanisms of  breakdown   decomposition  in Iraq? We do not think  so   it .  Far  be it  from us  the idea  to minimize the  size   extent  of the task and its complexity, or to maintain the illusion  that it is easy   the facility . But we are convinced of one thing  have a conviction :  while  proceeding in the current way, we run the risk  to  of enter ing  a spiral without return.  Time is counted  The clock is ticking.  At the following day of  The day after the war  ended , the direct administration of Iraq by the forces of the coalition caused, in spite of supported efforts, a faintness persisting in the population. The re-starting of  the  essential public services  and   ,  the repair of  the  infrastructure s , were  some  similarly delayed  of as much .  The  legitimate expectations  waiting  of the Iraqis were disappointed.  Another way remains possible, placing the Iraqi people  at   in  the heart of the process of rebuilding and calling upon the responsibility of the international community.  We  are  divide d but  all  have  the same objective: to establish  the  stability and the conditions of the rebuilding in Iraq. France is ready to work within the Security Council with the United States and the other countries engaged on the ground ,  for the benefit of Iraq. But it is necessary to leave the ambiguity which would lead to a failure for the Iraqi people, with the risk of  a  discredit ing   of  the international community. That supposes a radically new approach.  Even  The  more so as it is the whole of the area which is threatened. We are all aware that the problem exceeds the borders  framework  of Iraq:  it is  the stability of the  Arab-Muslim  world  arabo-Moslem   which is concerned  is at issue. In the Middle East, the exclusively sedentary option does nothing but maintain the cycle  of  violence and the reprisals that  to the  risk  to  destroy ing  the political prospects. This step - let us have courage to say it - is leading nowhere. Far from promoting stability, it arouses bitterness, incomprehension and frustration. Everywhere, the terrorist organizations benefit from the least weakness to reinforce their establishment and to nourish a violence which concerns us all.  How  do we   to  leave this  the  trap and  to  create  stability  the conditions  of stability  in Iraq?  Above all, let us recognize that the foreign presence constitutes in itself a point of fix ation  ing . Whatever the ir  goodwill  of each one ,  the foreign presence   it  crystallizes frustrations, focuses dissatisfactions,  and  distorts  gives  it political ly : everything is measured  all the parts concerned are determined  compared to it instead of mobilizing  itself  themselves  in favour of   for  Iraq s benefit . The effort of rebuilding implies that one works on clear bases and thus  which  one  puts   fixes  an expir y  ation date on  the current period of transition. It is the key  of  to any progress.  It is thus important above all to respect  the  Iraqi national sentiment  feeling , nourished of a  history  thousand-year-old  history  and carrying the future stability of the country. Conversely, it is necessary to avoid reinforcing particularistic  logics   thinking  or  communautarists   communitarianists [ethno-religious separatism?] .  Iraq is a ground of memory. Its attachment with its traditions and its identity already resulted in rejecting the external supervisions which  one wanted   others sought  to impose  upon it    to him . As a result,  It is resulted from it throughout   during the   last century   of the   sudden starts  which  shook  in-depth  the country  deeply .  Due to   Of  revolution  and    in  coup d'etat, it could not find the peace to which it aspires deeply.  Today,   the urgency   it is urgent  is to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqi people   itself  themselves in order to enable   him  them to assume its responsibilities fully. Then the various communities will find, I hope   for it , the force to work together. Then a step will be taken in the direction of a greater justice: it rests, indeed, with the Iraqis to make the decisions which engage the future of their country. But it is also  a matter   business  of effectiveness: for the various Iraqi communities as for the  neighboring   close  States, only the prospect for a sovereign political destiny can feed the ir  hope and make  it  possible the  company to be reconstituted  reconstitution of society.  Does that mean immediate departure of the forces of the coalition? Certainly not, and  of  many voices rise rightly to stress that that would create a vacuum worse than the current situation. These forces could remain under the command of the principal contributor of troops. Should their composition be  widened   broadened ?   Essence, according   What is essential  to us ,  is not to increase the number of soldiers on the ground, but to define a precise United Nations mandate for their action, limited in time, with  reports  regular and detailed  reports   with   to  the Security Council. One of the priorities, in particular, today is the security of the borders and  the stop of   halting  the infiltrations. A redeployment of the forces of the coalition could be studied, in connection with the Iraqis, in order to answer  at  this major risk.  Let us accelerate the formation of an Iraqi national army on the model of what we  are  do ing  in Afghanistan. That  supposes  presumes to partly make do  call  with the demobilized Iraqi forces, whose competences will be essential to restore safety long-term  durably .  The same work should be accomplished in the field of the police force. With time  term ,  we   this  could lead to an allocation of the functions in conformity with the respect of Iraqi  sovereignty  and, undoubtedly,  more effective sovereignty   greater efficacy : external safety a  in  priority for the forces of the United Nations, internal safety for the Iraqi authorities.  In this framework, and whereas in New York the negotiation of a new resolution  is  open ing  s , we propose the following sequence.  Current Iraqi institutions, i.e. the Council of government and the ministers recently named, would be considered by the Security Council of the United Nations the agent of Iraqi sovereignty for the transitional period. Within a very short time, for example one month, an Iraqi provisional government could be made up starting from these authorities, and would be seen  progressively  transferring  in a progressive way  the executive power, including the economic activity and budgetary.  A personal envoy of the Secretary General of the United Nations would be  elected   chosen  in order to organize consultations with the existing Iraqi institutions and the authorities of the coalition and to collect the support of  the States of the area   States in the region . This personal envoy would submit a report with the Council and would propose a calendar defining the gradual transfer of the capacities to wards  the provisional government and the methods of completion of this political transition.  This calendar should envisage the stages of a constitutional process with the objective  to   of  submit ting  a  project of   draft  text before the end of the year. General elections could be considered as soon as possible, from here [?] in spring 2004.  France is ready to take all its responsibilities within this framework. Since the sovereignty of Iraq would be restored, an international conference could be convened in order to approach the whole of the problems related to the rebuilding of the country. It would aim at restoring the coherence and the effectiveness of the international action in Iraqs favor. In the security domain, it will be necessary to decide  upon  contributions to the future force of the United Nations as  like  to the training of the army and the police force. In the same way, it will be necessary to define engagements as regards economic aid and the methods of the assistance to be brought to the reordering of the Iraqi administration.  Such is the direction of the proposals which we present at the Security Council. We do it in a spirit of dialogue with the United States as with all our other partners. We will find ourselves as of Saturday in Geneva with the permanent members of the Security Council and the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, convinced that the international community can build its unit y  around a demanding and ambitious project.  It is a challenge without precedent. It requires  to us comprehension and adaptation   that we comprehend and adapt  to the realities  in the field . It also requires that  each one want to forget well the quarrels of last and to give up the parties taken ideological  we forget past quarrels and give up sides taken for ideological reasons. The rebuilding of Iraq is a shared duty.  Dominique de Villepin is Foreign Minister. ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE EDITION OF 13.09.03

      Yesterday I flew back to Washington's [Reagan] National Airport from Seattle (via Phoenix).   Flying on September 11 was less of a big deal than I thought it would be.   There were three Phoenix police officers at the gate when I boarded my flight (presumably ethnically profiling oncoming passengers) and I think there may have been air marshals on the plane (several big crew-cut guys near the front of the plane).  Other than that, security was appallingly normal - I was able to get my Leatherman and shaving razor on in my carry-on without incident.    CNN, the airport terminal  Pravda , was playing September 11 retrospectives and terrorism news everywhere I went, so I couldn't stop thinking about that day.  I thought back to an embarrassing moment that day when I went to a high floor in Georgetown's law school library to try to see the Pentagon or smoke rising from it.  I realized when I got up there and saw what looked like smoke rising that I was trying to see a spectacle, when this was in fact an unimaginable disaster, and felt horribly guilty.   That memory returned to me as I watched CNN trot out all the memorial footage this September 11th and it will probably be what I remember the longest about that fateful day.

      It sounds like the U.S. and Iraqis are receptive to  urlLink creating a large domestic Iraqi paramilitary police force .  But in the resurgent ethnic and religious politics of Iraq, how would such a police force be received?  If they are seen as representatives of enemy ethnic/religious groups, they probably won't be well received, unless miraculously they are able to do a great job at creating security or prove better at interacting with Iraqis than American soldiers.  But if these domestic forces are put together so that their ethnic makeup matches the areas in which they are employed, will they be police, will they become tools of local leaders or will they remain sectarian, ethnic or party militias?  One would hope that the U.S. learned not to allow militias to gain official recognition from Afghanistan as it promotes warlordism.  However, the U.S. can't get on without militia forces in Afghanistan and if the U.S. can't recruit nonpartisan local forces, it may be stuck relying on these forces.  That would not be good for the long-term welfare of the Iraqi state.  Such forces could be a positive outlet for at least a few of the large number of unemployed soldiers.  If the paramilitary forces are widely enough recruited in Shiite areas, they can form a good alternative to party militias and help limit strife between Shiite factions.  But in Sunni areas, creating paramilitary forces could mean arming people who disagree with the U.S.  And what will happen if the crime-fighting of the paramilitary forces is not equal across sectarian, party, or ethnic lines?  This seems a particular problem to me in Baghdad, where local Shiites don't want to be policed by outsiders, and Sunnis presumably feel the same way.   Looking at all these potential problems, I'm not suprised the U.S. has been unsure whether creating such a force is a good idea.  However,with the sabotage attacks and audacious bombings of international and domestic leaders, the U.S. needs to create more security.  Without more American soldiers available, no foreign troops coming to Iraq any time soon, and the Iraqi military disbanded and not soon to be reconstituted, such a paramilitary police force appears to be the only viable option.

      Remember how France threatened to hold up relaxation of sanctions on Libya after a deal was reached between the U.S. and Libya over the Lockerbie bombing?  Well, the French government, which had wanted money from Libya for a French airliner bombing over Niger  urlLink appears to have played a good game .  Libya wanted to improve its relations with the West, so France  urlLink got its money , even though its claim may not have had strong legal standing.  I wonder if the French government isn't free-riding on an American display of resolve in Aghanistand and Iraq.  What I mean is, if the Libyan government was pushed to make a deal on Lockerbie because the United States after September 11 hasn't taken kindly to state sponsors of terrorism (to put it mildly).    I don't know, it's just idle speculation, but I'd love to know why Muammar Qaddafi made this deal right now.

      As I've mentioned before, we are finding that American soldiers in Afghanistan are attracting terrorist types in a way that is consistent with the 'flypaper thesis.'    But it was never so clear  urlLink as it is in this case : more Taliban fighters are headed to the Dai Chupan district in Zabul province to join a weeklong battle with American soldiers and their Afghan militia allies.  Hopefully more of the bad guys will join the fight and get themselves wiped out rather than just hide out in Pakistan.

      I've had trouble sleeping lately, so I was up at 2:00am when a repeat of yesterday's  urlLink Meet the Press  came on.  Senator John Kerry was the only guest and Tim Russert really did a number on Kerry.  Kerry did not impress me at all.    Kerry was good at first, but when Russert started asking tough questions - how can he push improvements in health care, add two divisions to the U.S. military and bring down deficits (a la Clinton) as he claims?  Kerry's response was incomprehensible.    His answers to questions about his saying he was "lied to about the war" by President Bush were long dissemblings that seemed less to say that Bush lied than that Kerry was reasonable in believing President Bush's case for war.  It seemed clear that Kerry was too strongly behind the war to push the case against it very strongly.  Which brings me to Howard Dean.  Kerry made it very clear Sunday he was running against Dean.  Kerry attacked Dean for his lack of experience in national affairs and gave his canned sound bite, "this president has made it clear that being president is not something for governors to learn about on the job" (or something like that).  Essentially, Kerry said Dean wasn't fit to be a foreign policy president in an era of terrorism, occupation of Iraq, Korean and other international crises.    But, in fact, the way that Russert was able to bring out Kerry's past stands on issues and the way Kerry responded - calculated and incomprehensible at the same time - shows why people might actually prefer Dean.  Dean hasn't had to take stances on a number of national issues (though  urlLink some of those he  has  taken  don't thrill me).  Dean may be able to put together clearer, simpler stances and get behind them without making it sound like he's saying whatever people think is right at the time.  The kind of spin Kerry has to put on his past stances unfortunately makes him sound duplicitous.

      I'm leaving Tuesday for Seattle to visit family and take a trip into the mountains.  I once planned to hike the Olympic Mountains' Skyline Trail, but to get my brother, sister, and (especially) my Dad to come along, I picked a site in the Cascades closer to where they live now.    So we're headed to Easy Pass, Fisher Creek Basin, and Thunder Creek Basin in North Cascades National Park.  My Dad complained a bit about the climb up to Easy Pass, but I think it's a good way to climb first and have a downhill hike the rest of the way.  We gain 2,800 feet in 2.5 miles and then go downhill the rest of the way.  Tough, but at least it's not tough when you're sore from having already hiked a ways.  My brother Gabe also had to mess things up by having a friend get married the Friday of our trip.  So he has to hike out early.  Loser.  So that's how it goes.  You make plans, but when you try to bring along other people, everything gets messed up.  Oh well.  I'd much rather not take the trip  alone.  . . . . Anyway, I won't be able to post for a long bit, probably from about September 2 &#8212; September 8.  But I'll get good material for posts &#8212; lots of pictures, daily trip details, oh and this was some great planning on my Mom's part &#8212; I'm flying into [Reagan] National Airport on September 11.  Just doing that should be the subject of a very long post.

      OK, so I've thought about it some more and I'm not quite as down about it as I was.  I think the key is that there has to be an increase in jobs.  According to an economist I saw on the  Newshour  tonight, Americans didn't work any more hours this quarter than prior quarters, they were just more productive somehow.  So it's not like there's a great demand for new workers.  Whether businesses will react optimistically and start hiring based on last quarter is really the issue.  I'd bet if there are two quarters like this we'll definitely have a lot of people casting off pessimistic attitudes.  So, as I saw Wes Clark do tonight on the  Newshour , Democrats can still say that the tax cuts were misplaced - given to the wrong people.  And by the way Clark didn't seem to have a clear message a got bogged down in the details.    I get annoyed at President Bush's knee-jerk reaction when reporters ask who is attacking Americans in Iraq: terrrrrists.  But having Clark give me details on how religious leaders are developing personal armies and attempting to assassinate one another is a little much for 20 seconds of a long interview.  And I'm a foreign policy fan.  Clark is going to have to learn something about soundbite politics if he's going to survive against the competition.    I am once again impressed by the ability of Bill Clinton to bridge the vastly different worlds of Oxford and Little Rock, hopefully Clark will be able to do the same.

       urlLink   Translation:    There is approximately a 0.0% chance of a Democrat being elected President in 2004.   At least that's my initial gut feeling.  The Bushies can claim it's all about the tax cut, the Democrats will dispute it, but no longer can they say that the tax cuts were a useless giveaway to rich people.    The only thing the Democrats can hope for is another bad quarter or that unemployment remains steady and we continue in this "jobless recovery" we have been dealing with for the past several years.  Otherwise, Democrats will look like worrywarts and naysayers in the face of American insta-optimism, which never makes for good presidential politics.  And, oh yeah, there's this occupation going on in Iraq.  Maybe the American people will lose faith in President Bush's team's handling of the war on terror, the occupation of Iraq and peace negotiations in the Middle East.  But that would go against the long-standing conventional wisdom that Republicans do better at foreign policy and the emerging conventional wisdom that Democrats can manage the economy in a sounder fashion.  So to add it up, Bush has optimism as a plus, foreign policy as a weak plus, economics as a sharply weakening negative. The Democrats are pessimistic, which is a negative (unless everything falls apart), foreign policy is a weak negative (maybe a weak positive if the right Democrats come to the fore),  and economics are a sharply weakening positive.  I think that means Bush wins in 2004.

      My parents are facing flooding near their home in Mount Vernon, Washington.  Trees are streaming down the Skagit River, people are sandbagging and moving documents.  It seems a pretty big deal.  My Dad just sent me a link to a  urlLink clickable realtime map of the flooding .  Check it out, especially if you live in that area or know someone who does.   urlLink     The data below I found by clicking the leftmost yellow triangle above.  It indicates that as of 11:15AM, October 21, the Skagit River is several feet over flood stage near Mount Vernon.   Not Good .    urlLink

      Much derision has come to the Bush Administration's constant hyping of Iraq as the central front on the war on terror.  Many have said that it is only the central to the war on terror because of American ineptitude and Iraqi impatience.  But wait, another person with another perspective on the war on terror has weighed in:  Osama Bin Laden.    Bin Laden's latest tape has found its way into the hands of Al Jazeera and promotes attacks against American and coalition forces in Iraq and elsewhere.  If there is a war on terror going on right now, Bin Laden is generally seen as the main enemy in that war.  If Bin Laden is saying that Iraq is going to be the  urlLink "decisive"  battle of the war on Iraq, that certainly backs up President Bush's claim that Iraq is the central front of the war on terror, doesn't it?  Even if,  urlLink as Juan Cole notes , Iraq may not be that central front, Bin Laden's exhortations to fight Americans there sure makes it easier for the Administration to make that claim.  Oh, and what's funny is that Bin Laden doesn't just support Republican positions.  He  urlLink notes on his tape that the United States is running a $450 billion  - plus deficit, as many Democrats always remind the country.  Welcome, Mr. Bin Laden, to the American policy discourse.

      The September 30  "theatrical" trailer  (currently in theaters before  urlLink Kill Bill Vol. 1 ) is 2 minutes 30 seconds long, with about 2:10 in content.  Fade up from dark and quiet.  Thudding music comes in as black and red streak toward the viewer.  This clears up to become three huge, apparently technically complex, black metal conduits lit with red lights and occasional lightning strikes from a black sky full of clouds.  These conduits, judging by the size of mountains in the pictures, are huge.  They lead through a jagged black landscape toward what appears to be a massive depression and continue from the other end.   As lightning flashes, the scene cuts to show Neo standing stiffly near the end of a curved grating overlooking a vast plain of machine stalagmites.  It almost resembles a machine city.  Near Neo are several bulbous shapes, which appear to be pods in which humans are kept in the Matrix, though they are not pink like human pods.  A large machine rises up to "face" Neo; it is spherical but covered with large spines making it resemble a gigantic black sea urchin.  Electricity courses between its spines.  Only its top 1/3 can be seen.  It says, in a deep metallic voice:  "SPEAK!"  Neo says, "The program Smith has grown beyond your control..."   As these words are spoken, the scene darkens and we see Smith seated, turning his head, possibly to address someone [my guess is that it is the Oracle].  Behind him are two more suit-clad men, presumably more Smiths.  Quick Cut to Smith, holding a pistol in his right hand, looking up a very deep stairwell.  5 or 6 other suit-clad figures with pistols in their right hands can be seen on the stairs as well, presumably also Smiths.  Quick cut to Smith taking off his sunglasses in a shabbily wallpapered apartment - probably the Oracle's apartment.  A small painting of a flower hangs crooked on the wall.  Quick cut to a rainy street lined with Smiths as Smith walks to the middle of the street to face Neo.  Lightning flashes as we cut to grimacing Smiths, then to Neo,   Neo (voice over) continues, "You cannot stop him, but I can . . . "  We now see the main body of the spiny round machine.  It has a glassy surface turned toward Neo, behind which one can see a churning metallic substance.  The machine responds in the deep voice, "And if you fail!?!"  The gravity of the scene and the machine's unique appearance make it appear that Neo is speaking to someone or something very powerful among the machines.  Cut to Neo jumping to avoid Smith flying toward the screen through a hole smashed in a wall.   A large flash of (matrix-code display colored) green light winks out, hinting that if Neo fails, it will not mean only the destruction of free humanity, the machines and/or the humans in the matrix die too.   [Gabe believes the winking out green light machines will die, Andy believes the green color signifies the matrix, meaning humans in the matrix will die there.  Both are plausible.]  Cut to Neo seated, blindfolded, in a dark place (out of focus) with a jack apparatus coming up behind him.  It quickly stabs itself at the back of his head.  As the apparatus does not appear like those the humans use and it moves on its own, this raises suspicions that Neo is not on any human ship.  In response to the machine's raising the possibility of failure, Neo says [pause], "I won't."  [Warner Bros./Village Roadshow images cut in]  Fade in to Trinity, saying, "Do you know what happened to Neo?" She is talking to someone offscreen, possibly the Oracle.  However, it is not the Oracle's apartment - in the background are odd black pieces of furniture - bedposts, maybe? - suggesting that she may be in Merovingian's castle.  Quick cut to Neo opening his eyes with tile behind him.  Quick cut to scene of huge floating bug-like machine moving over land.  The camera shows that Neo is actually in a tiled subway station, sitting on the smooth cement subway platform.  The platform wall says "Mobil Ave."  A little girl in yellow (East Indian).  Neo scans the area, suggesting he does not know where he is.  Oracle voiceover starts, "He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world."   Cut to a gleaming cluster of skyscraper-like round towers rises from a dark clouded plain on which gigantic harvesting machines gather or tend to red human pods on black stalks.  The towers are probably a machine city or something like that.  Cut to Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph descending a flight of stairs to enter a green-laser lit club, guns drawn.  The three point their guns to control the crowd of clubber misfits.  Merovingian (voiceover) says "Bring me the eyes of the oracle, and I will give you back your 'savior.'"  He bathes the last word in Frenchy sarcasm.  As Merovingian says this, we cut to Neo, standing with his back to the camera.  He is punched in the stomach by a scraggly long-haired white guy (a bum?) as a beared Hispanic man in a light-colored suit carrying a leather suitcase and an Asian woman in a trenchcoat of the same color.  Both appear unhappy.  Neo takes the punch surprisingly poorly for his abilities within the matrix; he flies backfirst into the subway station wall, legs and arms hanging backward.  Tiles and the "Mobil Ave" lettering are crushed by the impact.  Cut to Merovingian smiling and setting down his martini as he finishes making his demand.  Cut to Neo, on the ground looking sideways from a crawling position with some broken tile nearby.  He looks past the camera (at his attacker) with fear and astonishment.  Cut through Matrix-green numbers to Neo waking up, eyes and mouth wide in astonishment, in a human ship's chair with Trinity standing over him.  Presumably Neo has been rescued from the bad situation he was just in.  Quick cut to a man with sensors on his forehead lying with his eyes closed.  This is the human taken over by a downloaded Smith in "Reloaded."  His eyes open suddenly.  Cut to Neo, facing this real-world Smith (who has a mouth and neck blackened by something like oil.  Neo says, "Who are you?"  The real-world smith says, "Look past the flesh and see your enemy..."  Neo looks at him (in the same way he sees through the matrix as code) and sees a "burning" version of a sunglasses-wearing Smith.  Neo says, "Its impossible".  Real-world Smith says, "not impossible, inevitable".  Cut to a 7 or 8 Smiths filing into what appears to be the Oracle's apartment  Cut again to show Smith, sans sunglasses, laughing demonically in the Oracle's kitchen, which looks to have been torn up.  Now cut to war buildup sequence, where four exoskeleton-clad Zion humans are walking.   The commander of Zion's defenses says, "In less than 12 hours the machines will breach the dock walls."  Cut to massive drill falling as if it has broken through the ceiling of Zion.  It falls to Zion's surface, smashing machinery and structures as it lands.  The scene darkens looking over the shoulders of exoskeletons.  We see a swarm of fast-moving Sentinels moving through a huge cavern.  Cut to a scene where exoskeletoned soldiers are being charged by their commander (an older guy): "If we have to give our lives we give 'em hell before we do!"  An  army of exoskeleton-clad soldiers raise their massive meachanical arms and cheer in response.  Cut to Neo asking the Oracle, "Can Zion be saved?"...   She responds (off-screen as always) "Tonight the future of both worlds will be in your hands"...   Cut to exoskeletoned fighters picking up ammunition belts and pointing their weapons at the top of the dome of Zion (from which the drill fell), readying themselves for battle.  Zee moves to hold Link in a crowd of people in what appears to be the "dance chamber," none of whom appear to be dancing.  Cut to Neo facing off with Smith on the rainy street. The Oracle continues, "...or in his." (referring to Smith).  Cut to Neo walking down rainy street toward smith. Smith says, "Mr. Anderson, welcome back... We missed you."  Neo says, "It ends tonight."  Smith and Neo run toward each other.  They strike each other then fly apart.   Cut to Neo flying backward in a room that appears to be the one in which he was "tested" by Seraph in "Reloaded."  Neo lands against the wall, grits his teeth and explodes forward.  The wall behind him crumples from the impact.  Cut back to Neo and Smith in the rainy street, seen from above.  As they come together, water explodes around them.  Cut to a door or machine within Zion exploding open in a burst of fire.  Quick cut to Neo and real-world Smith and neo fighting over a plasma gun on ship.    Quick cut to a gas-masked guy being blown upward.  Quick cut to Trinity looking upward in a room full of people seated at couches, wearing black and red leather.  This is presumably the S & M club.  A gun appears to be falling from above.  Quick cut to somebody jumping across a subway track, right in front of the bright lights of a train (saying "Loop").  It is almost certainly the bearded, long-haired guy who punched Neo extremely hard earlier in the trailer.  White light cuts to Morpheus, with Link in the background, saying to Niobe, "you've never believed in the one."  Niobe says, "I still don't . . . I believe in him."  Cut to Morpheus and Neo embracing.  Sense is that Neo wasn't sure he'd ever see Morpheus again.  Appears to be on a ship.  Cut to hordes of sentinels flying through the machinery decks of Zion.  An operator turns from several computer terminals to yell, "the dock is breached!"  Cut to Morpheus in ship's harness, saying calmly, darkly, "here they come."  Cut to the exoskeleton-wearing general firing his gun-arms upward, screaming defiance.  Cut to a battle scene, we are behind the exoskeletons firing tons of bullets in every direction toward the sentinels.    Weapons are also being fired from turrets.  Cut to a woman launching two shoulder-fired missiles of some kind. There is some kind of impact and a large explosion. There are fireballs everywhere as sentinels and parts of Zion explode.  Cut to Neo walking down some kind of orange-energy corridor. It resembles the psychedelic world of Animatrix short #9.  Morpheus says, "Neo is doing what he believes he must do."  Following the three conduits on the ground, a massive fleet of flying machine weapons head toward the screen. There is a momentary closeup on what appears to be a weapon on one of these machines, shooting a large bolt of energy.  Trinity says to Neo, sitting next to her on a ship, "if you tell me we'll make it, I'll believe you." She reaches out to grasp his hand.  Neo replies, "We'll make it.  We have to."  A ship, almost certainly the one in which Neo and Trinity are sitting, flies over the ground, following the three conduits shown in first scene of trailer. There are no machines in front of them, though there are lights edging a row of mountains toward which they are headed.  Cut to a horde of sentinels flying along the same conduit, presumably chasing Neo. One of them is bounding, fish-like. It begins to glow orange underneath as if it is exploding.  Neo, blindfolded, reaches out his hand toward the camera.  Suddenly, there is a huge explosion where there was a horde of sentinels, just above the three conduits. It now appears the sentinels were there to prevent Neo and Trinity from reaching the brightly lit buildings at the edge of the mountains, as these lights appear much closer in this scene.  Quick cut to show explosions outside the front window of the ship Neo and Trinity are in. Neo is still blindfolded and holding Trinity's hand.  Morpheus (voiceover) says, "I don't know what he can do to save us."  Cut to Trinity and Neo's ship flying through horrible explosions and lightning; a sentinel hurtles at the ship's window.  Morpheus continues, "but I do know that as long as there is a single breath in his body, he will not give up"...  Cut to Neo, flying with Smith holding on to him, between the buildings above the rainy street scene.  Cut back to the sentinel hurtling at Neo, who is suddenly hit with wierd streams of light, similar to Animatrix #9.  Cut to Neo, wet, poised, beckoning toward Smith (offscreen) to bring it on. They are in the room into which Neo broke a hole and Smith followed, if I interpret the scenery correctly.  Morpheus finishes, "and neither can we."  Quick cut to explosions in Zion.  Quick cut to Trinity and Neo embracing.  Quick cut to a Matrix room seen in "green code," where we see what look like three Smiths hovering over a man seated at a table (probably a captive - Neo?). The man is glowing brightly. A wind of material flies through the room. The captivity resembles that of Morpheus in "The Matrix."  Cut to Neo, being held up at the collar by Smith. Smith is about to hit Neo. They are standing surrounded by what appears the rubble of a modern building.  Cut to a blue sky, criss-crossed by clouds (very surprising!). A crescent moon can be seen and it appears to be morning. A ship, trailing smoke, with no blue electric lights lit (which are supposed to be necessary for flying), falls toward the camera. It appears to be hurtling downward toward the surface of the Earth.  Cut to Matrix Revolutions title and the Oracle saying, "everything that has a beginning has an end..."  11.05  END

      I thought I'd put out a quick transcript for the newest trailer for Matrix Revolutions.  sept 30th trailer is 2 minues 30 seconds long  Fades in with look at metal covered surface of the earth following some massive conduits toward maybe some massive hole in the ground.  Fades to back of Neo looking at this floating sphere with large spines on it from a large conduit  The metal sphere says, "Speak" in a low tone denoting being the master of the machine world or something very powerful  Neo says, "The program Smith has grown beyond your control..." cut to street/rain scenes with neo/smith battle...  Neo continues, "you cannot stop him, but I can"... the machine responds in the deep voice, "and if you fail!"  cut to Smith flying at screen and Neo jumping up to avoid him. Then green light winks out on screen, signifying that if Neo fails, the machines die too.  Cut to neo with blindfold on ship about to be jacked in, says.. "I won't"  Trinity says, "Do you know what happened to Neo", to Oracle (offscreen).  Oracle voiceover starts, "He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world."   Shows him in a room where the typical little girl talks to him and tells him random things and he goes, I'm confused that kinda thing. It then shows a farm of humans and a massive city in the distance, probably the machine home city.  The club owner guy, that was keeping the key maker before says, "Bring me "...as Trinity and Morpheus descend into green-laser-lit club...he continues, "the eyes of the oracle, and I will give you back your savior"... as Neo is struck by some people in a subway toward a wall and looks like he's getting captured.  Neo appears to wake up from being struck by the guy in the subway in his chair on a ship.   Cut to, "Mr. Anderson", and this time its not smith but the human taken over by smith (who I'll call real-world smith), who wanted to kill neo in the tunnel in Zion, and cut his hand to see if he was real too.  Cut to Neo saying, "Who are you.."... The real-world smith, appearing to have oil on his mouth... says, "Look past the flesh and see your enemy..." and it shows a burning version smith...  Neo says, "Its impossible".  Real-world Smith says, "not impossible, inevitable".--as in another scene, Smiths file into Oracle's apartment, and cut to Smith laughing in Oracles kitchen.  Now cut to war buildup sequence, where exoskeletons are walking. Voiceover with commander of Zion saying, "In less than 12 hours the machines will breach the dock walls.   Cut to massive drill falling as if it broke thru the ceiling of Zion and falls all the way down to bottom of Zion, smashing the ground.  Cut to waiting scene with Exoskeletons and rallying cry type speech... "If we have to give our lives we give em hell before we do"... shows army of exo skeltons raising massive meachanical arms/weapons.. as scene with many many sentinels flies down tunnel...  Neo saying to Oracle, "Can Zion be saved?"... she responds (off-screen as always) "Tonight the future of both worlds will be in your hands"... shows Zion exo army and Link and his girl...  cut to Neo/Smith rainy street scene. Oracle continues... "...or in his" (referring to Smith).  Cut to Neo walking down rainy street toward smith. Smith says, "Mr. Anderson, welcome back... we missed you"  Neo says, "It ends tonight."  Smith and Neo running toward each other... striking then flying apart. Explosion of water from smith and neo fighting, then explosion of door on zion blowing open.. real-world smith and neo fighting over plasma gun on ship.. fighting gas masked people in gun shop, somebody jumping across subway track...  cut to morpheus saying, "you've never believed in the one"  naiobe says, "I still dont, I believe in him".. morpheus and neo hug... cut to sentinels flying thru zion...  operator saying, "the dock is breached!"  cut to morpheus flying ship, "here they come"...  cut to exo's firing of weapons...  cut to lots of weapons being fired from turrets and a woman shooting a dual RPG..  now shows neo walking in psychadelic world similar to animatrix #9... morpheus says, "neo is doing what he believes he must do."  sentinels flying toward camera  trinity says to neo, who is sitting next to her in ship, "if you tell me we'll make it, I'll believe you" (grasping hands)  Neo and trinity's ship fly in air above ground, following the 3 conduits shown in first scene of movie... shows bouncing sentinel looking machines running on ground...  morpheus saying, "I don't know what he can do to save us"  cut to trinity and neo's ship flying thru horrible explosions and lightning...   morpheus continues, "but I do know that as long as there is a single breath in his body, he will not give up"... shows neo beckon somebody to come fight him...   also shows him getting hit by some wierd streams of light in the world like animatrix #9...  morpheus continues, "and neither can we"  multiple explosions, and trinity and neo embracing  shows green matrix behind the scenes view where the floor looks green and walls look green and so on and it looks like a wind of material is flying into a room where somebody is help captive in a chair similar to morpheus before...  cut to scene with neo and smith, and neo is being held by smith about to get hit...   cuts to scene where you can see the sky, and the cresent moon and a ship flying toward the surface of the earth...  cut to matrix revolutions title and oracle saying, "everything that has a beginning has an end..."

       Where's the outrage, anti-cloners?   When the country is full of people who rage over cloning,  urlLink why isn't anybody mad that scientists are messing with monkey brains so that the monkeys can be given extra robotic arms ?   Isthe difference that cloning is changing nature?   No, allowing monkeys to use their brains to control machines doesn't seem natural.   Is the difference between cloning and monkey brain experimentation based in the fact that, despite their destructive nature, these experiments hold so much promise for helping people overcome debilitating diseases and the like?  No, wait a minute, cloning does that too. . . . . Hmmmmm . . . . . Is it that messing with humans and messing with monkeys is different?  That humans have souls and monkeys are objects?  That's probably it.  I'm not a big fan of animal rights activists, but I'm with them here.  Monkey brain experimentation seems to cross some line, in my mind.  On a funnier note, can't you wait for the day when giant robo-monkeys escape their handlers and careen through the streets of large cities searching for bananas or whatever?  That'd be hilarious.

      As I watched Tony Snow interview Joe Lieberman on Fox News Sunday, I noticed an interesting colloquy about uranium from Africa rather than Niger.  Here is a relevant chunk of  urlLink text from the transcript : SNOW: Well, let me just get in another thing. You said the president said there was proof that Iraq tried to buy uranium in Niger.  SNOW: The president never said that.  LIEBERMAN: Sure sounded like he said it.  You know, and look, let me go back to what you know, Tony. I supported the war. I supported overthrowing Saddam Hussein from 1998. I didn't need President Bush to convince me of that.  What troubles me, as a supporter of the war, is that the exaggerations and misleading statements made by this administration before the war and the total lack of preparation, including the failure to listen to the American military when they said we needed to send more troops to Iraq to secure the country, has compromised the just cause of the war...  SNOW: OK.  LIEBERMAN: ... against Saddam, against tyranny and against terrorism.  But we know now, the White House itself admitted, that the president's statement in the State of the Union about Iraq attempting to buy uranium from Niger shouldn't have been in there.  SNOW: Well, the president never used the term "Niger." And David Kay now says that, in fact, there were attempts to get it in Africa. Well, we're going to chase each other around the tree on this. Let's go to the...  LIEBERMAN: No, but that's clearly what they were thinking about.  Interesting, I thought.  Snow appeared to be defending the infamous "16 words" State of the Union quote about Iraq attempting to buy nuclear material from Africa by saying that the quote was about uranium from Africa, not Niger specifically.  The implication being that while attempts to procure yellowcake from Niger were unlikely, the intelligence regarding purchases from other countries in Africa (Somalia and Congo are in the NIE) was valid, supporting the statement made in the State of the Union.  And today I saw  urlLink Andrew Sullivan holding court , addressing this issue, saying reporters have twisted President Bush's Africa into Niger, which is inaccurate.  Here's my question, then: what did  urlLink Hadley and everybody else apologize for ?  As far as I remember it, Hadley, Rice, Tenet  et al.  were talking about the State of the Union verbiage (that is "Africa," not "Niger") when they all apologized for allowing the language into the speech.    Don't the apologies moot this recent (revisionist) understanding of the State of the Union speech?

      Wow.  How could this have been pulled off?   urlLink The New York Times is reporting  that senior U.S. officials, after arresting a number of people at the Guantanamo camp where Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners are being held, are looking into a possible conspiracy.  A conspiracy by Arabic speakers to improperly translate the words of American interrogators and the prisoners being questioned.  The interrogators couldn't speak the language, so the whole effort could have been in vain.  More than anything, this shows how absolutely necessary it is to have Americans qualified as fluent speakers of the languages most relevant to the War on Terror: Arabic, Dari, Pashto, Urdu . . . . among others.  I just noticed on  urlLink OxBlog   urlLink a nice factoid : there are only 54 fully qualified Arabic speakers in the State Department.  One can only guess how poor that means the capabilities are within the other parts of the U.S. military/intelligence/foreign policy establishment.  This reminds me of the cover story by  urlLink Mark Bowden  in The Atlantic, which profiles a top-notch Israeli interrogator, now retired, who prided himself on his very good colloquial fluency in several different Arabic dialects.  How long will it be until the U.S. has a corps of interrogators who are  fluent  enough in Arabic that we won't need translators who we unfortunately cannot trust?

      I was reading again, sadly, of a suicide bomb attack in Israel - this time in Haifa, at a popular restaurant with Arab and Palestinian owners.  I read that the Islamic Jihad-supported bomber was a  urlLink young woman whose brother and cousin were both killed by the Israeli Army  recently.  I could see, generally, how such a woman could be angry and bereaved, and I wondered whether Islamic Jihad was taking advantage of young people who are depressed or suicidal already.  That made me wonder, outside of suicide attackers, what are suicide rates like in Palestinian areas?      urlLink This article  from  Palestine Report  says there were more than 14 suicide attempts in Gaza during March 1997, but the information seems entirely anecdotal.   urlLink This article is similarly anecdotal , but says that suicide rates are rising because of diminishing political and economic hopes and domestic problems.  So repression in a conservative Palestinian society and depression at the failure of leaders to bring Palestinians a better political and economic prospects as well as Israeli repression (the only way to prevent bombings in the short term) appear to contribute to high suicide rates.  So suicide bombers aren't the only people committing suicide in Palestine.

      I believe the answer is  yes .   The problem with getting to this result is that the moratorium is not something that has been clearly and cogently reduced to writing . . . ,  e.g. ,  "We, the aforesigned Member states of the European Union, constituting a sufficient number to block approvals of new biotech-based food and feed products, commit to not allowing those products to be introduced into the European Union, whether or not that may violate EU WTO commitments." Instead, there is a  de facto  political moratorium, acknowledged on one hand by EU and member state officials in the quasi-internal debates on GMOs, but officially denied.    So, in a hilarious turn of events, the EU's responses to the U.S., Canadian, and Argentine consultation requests, the EU denies there is a moratorium and says approvals are being processed, but USTR is able to  repeatedly quote leading EU officials specifically to the contrary .  But wait a minute, a few quotes from EU officials do not a basis for a WTO Panel Report make.  So I looked into past Panel and Appellate Body Reports to find out whether this situation - a  de facto  but not  de jure  moratorium -  can be considered an actionable "measure."  It appears that whether or not something is a measure comes down to the old distinction between "mandatory" and "discretionary" measures.  I  have  to go to bed now, so I'll try to explain why in my next post.

      I've been away for a bit, not writing and then focusing on research for my super-project, whether the U.S. can successfully challenge the EU's GMO moratorium.    The first issue I tackled (and it has taken me an annoyingly long time to decide the answer) is whether the EU's moratorium on new GM product approvals is in fact a "measure" under the GATT, SPS, TBT and Ag Agreements.  I'll be trying to answer that in further posts (above) and then moving on to other issues.

But lest we forget, patriotism alone does not a foreign policy make.    Protectionism for American steel products did nothing but hurt the rest of the American economy, did little to help steel producers, and  urlLink now President Bush is going to repeal the safeguards just to avoid retaliation by the EU .  To me, whether you're for or against the steel tariffs, this flip-flop just goes to show that this President Bush has no better hold on "the vision thing" than did his father.

      I've been doing some reading and thinking, and this general thought came to mind:  The United States' winning the Cold War was based on its credibility.  That and the Soviet Union's inevitable collapse, but let's stick to American credibility.  American leaders made statements of strategic or ideological intentions and showed that we would follow through on our rhetoric.  We saved Berlin through an early airlift and through President Kennedy's electrifying Berliner speech.  Our credibility suffered when we could not save South Vietnam.    I think credibility is still the currency of international relations.  Military power, which the Bush Administration seems to rely on to such an extent, is only one component of credibility.  Military power is in fact an instrument of a credible foreign policy, and can't be credibly used willy-nilly.  American credibility is tied to strategic coherence - removing hypocrisy from American foreign policy is key.   I think the hypocrisy comes from the way in which American foreign policy is pulled in different directions.  Just as an example, we are protectionist toward American steel and agricultural producers, but try to promote free trade abroad.    If we are to promote American credibility abroad, we have to resolve these inconsistencies to whatever extent possible.  Tough job, huh?    Yeah, but that's what presidents and other leaders are supposed to do.  Demonstrate strategic coherence and improve American international credibility.

      Over the weekend, as promised, I've been reading some foreign policy speeches - most notably by the speakers at the  urlLink Center for American Progress 's  urlLink New American Strategies for Security and Peace Conference , who included Hillary Clinton, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Joe Biden and Chuck Hagel.    I had read Brzezinski's speech before, mostly because it had been noted in the press for its criticism of President Bush's foreign policy.  Some said that they were surprised to hear the kinds of criticisms Brzezinski was making because he certainly isn't some kind of isolationist antiwar Democrat by any means, but that was a half-hearted, weak criticism.  President Bush's foreign policy bothers a lot people, and we don't have to belong to ANSWER to say so.  I have to say, even before I read the speeches, I really liked Chuck Hagel.  I don't care that he's a Republican, I agree with him more often than Dennis Kucinich and respect him more than Al Sharpton.  I read his speech on alliances and thought it was generally pretty good.  There were the requisite number of mind-numbing non sequiturs and meaningless platitudes to identify it as a Senator's speech, but it did have some meat.    Hagel identified five priorities for American foreign policyand explained how strategic alliances and international structures were necessary to achieve these priorities.  These priorities are: alliances, military force structure/transformation, public diplomacy, energy security and international trade.  His major point was that despite our military power, we cannot achieve any of these things going it alone.  The United States has to be a leader, but that means there must be consideration of others' views and give and take.  Hagel said that multilateral institutions should be seen as a way to extend American power, not constrain it, and that coalitions of the willing are not building blocks for a stable world.  He said that our key relationships are with Russia and China, particularly because of the help they can provide on Iran and North Korea, respectively.  He said that the way our troops are being used now is harmful to people and families back home and will hurt recruiting in the active military and National Guard.  Hagel mentioned the now-famous Rumsfeld memo detailing how we cannot properly fight terrorism using our current military, saying that this was an indication that terrorism is not a solely military problem.  Hagel said that the United States' leadership in the world is rooted in trust and confidence in American intentions, and today many do not trust the U.S.  He says we should persuade others with quiet confidence and inner strength, and we cannot bring civilization through military force.  We should use educational and professional exchange programs and adjust visa policy accordingly.  We have to lead and commit to reaching out to others.  Hagel mentioned briefly that there is no such thing as energy independence, and interdependence is a reality that cannot be separated from American foreign policy.  The U.S. should not pay attention only to our economic needs in getting oil and natural gas from regions with civil unrest, corruption and underdevelopment.  Hagel also stated that global trade is a fact of life and that we should not allow agricultural subsidies to undermine this round of WTO talks as they did at Cancun.  While trade creates winners and losers and politicians often hear calls for protectionism, protecting noncompetitive industries or using unilateral sanctions will not strengthen our global competitiveness.    Hagel concluded by drawing hope from American dynamism, our opportunity to lead, and America's unique military and economic strength and spiritual faith. He restated that American power has limits and that we must listen to and work with our friends, and balance our present and future interests.  That's a credulous summary.  Here's my take: Hagel has a sense of what the rest of world is good for that the Bush Administration (and many Democrats for that matter) do not.  He understands the value of international institutions and effective diplomacy in promoting American interests and leading the world.  He recognizes that some things we want cannot be obtained working alone.  Hagel has figured out that "war on terrorism" does not capture the challenge to which we have to rise.  He realizes that we cannot have dependable sources of oil without working to stabilize the regions in which it is found.  Hagel resists the pull of protectionism and understands that global economics is a fact of life.    Now I just wish somebody in the presidential race believed what Hagel does.

      Out here in DC, nobody's showing the Apple Cup, a game of importance in Washington second only to the Rose Bowl (or a BCS bowl game these days).  Of course, my brother Gabe is a season-ticket holder, so last I talked to him he was getting set to go down to Husky Stadium.  Lucky bum.  Instead I watched Maryland work to pull up to tie N.C. State in the last minutes of today's game - then saw Maryland's kicker Nick Novak miss a point after that should have cost them the game.  But a big hit on a rushing T.A. McLendon turned the ball over to Maryland with less than 2 minutes and Novak was able to redeem himself with a field goal to win it, 26-24.  As I write this, it is halftime at Husky Stadium, with 8th-ranked WSU leading UW 13-7.  WSU is having a strong season while UW has floundered, particularly of late.  They lost 54-7 to Cal last week.  Hopefully UW will be able to win this one and keep their 6-year Apple Cup winning streak alive, but like I said, I'm hoping rather than expecting that outcome.  Also in sports this weekend:  I'm currently watching  my  alma mater, American University, get their asses handed to them by Nick Caner-Medley and the rest of the University of Maryland basketball team.

      What I am wondering is a small comment on the picture associated with the article from 60 minutes that Andy posted. It says that in the next decade the United States could be getting 25% of its oil from Equatorial Guinea. Is it just me or does this seem somewhat amazing? I guess the thing that is strange is that any one country would be getting that much revenue from the U.S.   One comment I like from the story is that the president is happy to have some of everything rather than all of nothing. I think all too often groups like human rights watch don't think about the fact that people that are currently alive in a country are typically thinking about themselves and the present time frame rather than 30 years down the road. If they have a choice between having oil money from under the water or not, they will choose to have oil money.  Most likely the 12% first year revenues that go to the country will only be for the first year. After one year it will progressively go up to a much more reasonable rate. The Americans that went over there to look for oil are just like venture capitalists--they took a chance and it paid off. Why shouldn't they get a cut of the deal, its not like they are stealing from the people.

      Gabe's right in saying that the capitalists who went to Equatorial Guinea for Oil are venture capitalists and good for the world economy.  However, the corruption that is endemic to Equatorial Guinea (and many other countries) - means that natural resource wealth is being gobbled up by those in power rather than shared with the people or used as a development resource.    In cases like Equatorial Guinea, these natural resources are like very large loans because the resources are exhaustible.  And the question is, what will the leaders of Equatorial Guinea do with these loans?  Will they use them to spur broader development and diversification?  Unfortunately, it seems that leaders in that country and too many others are willing to take the money and run, abandoning their fellow citizens to underdevelopment.

The channels all have been showing quick interviews with those agents of gentrification, gay men, complaining about the shooting and saying they're getting out of the neighborhood.  I believe we've now discovered the way to end gentrification in D.C.: a string of gang-related murders.

      I was flipping through the channels this morning when I happened upon Paul Bremer being interviewed by George Stephanopoulos.  I stopped and watched as Stephanopoulos asked Bremer whether a sovereign Iraqi government could demand that U.S. troops leave their country.  Bremer was suprisingly hesitant to answer, saying eventually that, yes, they could, but stated firmly that the Iraqis wouldn't.   I was somewhat surprised at his tone.  He could have simply said yes, which has to be true.  The U.S. can't keep its troops in Iraq in the face of a direct request to leave and maintain its freedom-oriented rhetoric.    So why was Bremer so unhappy to answer this question?   It has to do with giving sovereignty to the Iraqis in the face of guerrilla attacks.  While the move is justified for structural political reasons, it also looks like a concession in light of those guerrilla attacks.  Bremer did not want to say something that could be interpreted that way, as it could encourage terrorists to attack foreign targets and soliders, who would want to see what else they could bleed out of the Americans and how fast they could push them out.

      Can you tell I'm a Matrix fan?  Maybe it's the fact that I've written up trailer frame-by-frame analyses on this site with Gabe.  Here's the reason: I love well-imagined milieus, and despite its flaws, the Matrix certainly has one.    The trilogy moves toward its inevitable conclusion here, which is less interesting than the stages leading to this final conflict, but still exciting in each moment.  Some of the ideas could have been better fleshed out.  I felt that in the original Matrix, a lot of explanation was done well with a few well-placed brushstrokes.  But here I would have liked to have understood more, and felt more depth in many of the situations from which Neo and the rest have to extricate themselves.    The best individual scene was the one in which Neo speaks to the Indian family and sees the very human nature of many programs.  The father says that concepts like love and karma are just words, but clearly feels they are real.  The father will break all sorts of rules to save his daughter, though she is "useless."  Persephone wishes she could feel emotions in the way humans do, though she understands them.  Smith, by contrast, cannot understand human emotion and when one thinks hard about the origin of the machines, the Matrix, and Smith, it becomes clear that he is self-loathing and cannot understand the world or himself in a way that is common for many humans.  Unfortunately, how Neo ends up talking to Ramakandra (or whatever the guy's name is) and how he gets out of that situation are distracting and unsatisfying.  In terms of storytelling craft, the best portion of the film was the very ending, in which it is unclear whether Neo is dead or alive (though likely alive) and there is an odd peace starting to take shape between the humans and machines.  It would have been imprudent or even boring to have followed those threads any further, so I think it was a good decision to end the movie as it was ended.  Whether Neo will resurrected or mourned, cheered or nursed,  returned to Zion or turned into goo doesn't matter.  It would be as extraneous as that scene at the end of Star Wars where the heroes go up to get awards from Princess Leia.  Viewers already got the big payoff in the victory against the bad guys.     And following the outlines of a peace between humans and machines would unfortunately be boring and sad, as peace often is.   Maybe this could have been played out well, with references by both sides to the destruction of the Earth, the single-mindedness of war,  et cetera , but these sound like themes for a novel, not a movie.    And whatever we miss by not seeing these themes played out at the end of the Matrix will certainly be made up in the ending of the  urlLink  Return of the King  , due out at Christmas.  It gives me chills just to think of how Peter Jackson has portrayed Frodo's return to the ravaged Shire at the end of the story.  That was probably the greatest final chapters I have ever read, and doing well by that chapter at the end of the movie will probably win Peter Jackson and the film Oscars by acclaim.  Some have said this may not be the end of the Matrix, though its luster has faded to some extent.  However, I think the ending closes the door on the Matrix, even if we don't actually see the door shut and hear the lock click.

       urlLink This David Brooks column is just great .  As a Democrat, I see Howard Dean and think, "this guy really pumps you up."  After the embittering Gore loss in 2000 and 3 years of President Bush bumbling through, buoyed by a public rallying to the flag for the fight against terrorism, Democrats want someone who can make them feel right, cheer them on when they seem to have lost on a lot of fronts.  But getting pumped up isn't enough.  Brooks has an interesting idea.  He says that Dean's partisanism isn't any great dynamic that'll make Democrats able to capture the presidency or lead.  If D.C. is so partisan, another strong partisan won't be helpful in getting past the partisan trench warfare.  It's a good idea, and it isn't just some Republican smear of Howard Dean.  Democrats don't need a guy to cheer on the faithful in a crusade against Republicans, we need a persuasive and original political leader.  We have to have candidates who will willingly buck the Democratic party, think intelligently and do it with the same fearlessness that Dean uses to take on the Bush Administration.  If that means more centrist, that's fine.  The candidates just can't wobble or cave to either the Republican or Democratic orthodoxy.  Be resolute in your positions, explain them persuasively, and people will think hard about you.    Now this is hard during a primary campaign, but if none of the candidates will do it, none of them will deserve anything better than the running mate spot on the ticket, which can't win just on partisan rabble-rousing, even if Dean is cheering in unfavorable times for Democrats.  What we need is candidates who seem presidential, and that will come from staking out original positions and reaching out to Americans optimistically.    I think it is also important, after seeing how President Clinton led the country on policy, to find ways to make positions appeal to average voters and, therefore, to members of Congress who serve their constituents.  I see no candidate who is stating positions like President Clinton is right now.  Clinton has stated repeatedly that he's against tax breaks "for people like me," indicating himself.  That's a shrewd statement of policy, and I want a 2004 candidate who can debate the issues intelligently and in ways that bridge divides and can persuade the American public.  And though apparently a lot of bloggers disagree with me on this, I'm glad  urlLink the DLC is on my side .

      I  urlLink read in the  Post  today  that the attacks we are seeing now may have been a long-planned counterattack by Saddam Hussein.  I doubt it.  Hussein could have avoided his deposition by the United States by admitting he had no weapons of mass destruction, but never did this.  He tried to figure out ways in the last days to avoid the invasion through back-channel contacts, apparently.    Hussein wasn't a complete idiot, though, and realized the only way to fight the United States is to avoid concentrations of forces and sustained engagement with the U.S. military.  So he distributed weapons and let out criminals.  But to call this a planned counterattack, some plan to return to power in Iraq, is nonsense.   The resistance may have been something Saddam Hussein helped, but I doubt very much he is trying to pull some sort of modern-day Napoleonic stunt.

      So I guess we're going to get a big change in Iraq, with power shifting at the top by way of early elections and through use of Iraqi forces in the guerrilla campaign against Islamists and Baathists.  I think this is a good change.  First, the political change is good.  We are moving from a play-government in the form of the Iraqi Governing Council, which has turned out to exercise as much responsibility for Iraq as it has been given: not much.  If you want people who are going to be serious, let Iraqis choose a leader.  New leaders of their own choosing are a sign of consolidation of the change that has happened in Iraq.  It requires Iraqis to consider their future carefully rather than play coffee-shop quarterback to the Americans who are running their country for them.    It also puts a popular Iraqi presence in power that will form a significant counterweight to the opposition guerrillas who the CIA believes could instill fear into Iraqis and prevent the removal of Baathist elements and societal transformation in Iraq.   As for the use of Iraqi military forces, this has turned out to be the only viable option.  With the Bush Administration unwilling to commit more troops and probably unable to do so on a sustainable basis, the world either afraid of danger in Iraq or opposed to the U.S. intervention, and no other viable options coming to the fore, Iraqis are the only option.    And they are not a bad one.  Having Iraqis raid your home will not be as bad as having Iraqis do the same.  I think an emphasis should be placed on training Iraqi troops well to do their job and then letting them do it, rather than making them simply auxiliaries to American military forces.  I hope that will be possible.  But I am worried about the possibility that these new developments could be a way for the Bush Administration to cut the strings tying it to Iraq.  If the United States interested in military credibility, and I believe it is, U.S. foreign policymakers need to understand that a willingness to put the pieces back together - nation-building, to some extent - is a part of the calculus of modern war-making.  If we are going to reshape the security structure of the world in which we live, we cannot be solely in the business of destruction, we must also be in the process of building up.  We are too smart to leave countries in situations like post-World War I Germany, where they can fester and become dangerous.  I believe American credibility is tied to our willingness to remain to be successful.  Effectively engaging domestic military forces to take on security tasks for which they are suited and restarting democracy for the consolidation of a transition can help the United States maintain and even strengthen its international credibility and give the U.S. more of that combination of hard and soft power that allow us to maintain U.S. and international security.

      While I find it nice that my brother Gabe has taken it upon himself to post that I passed the bar, Gabe has unfortunately made several inaccurate statements I find it necessary to correct.    First of all, Gabe was wrong in saying that I can "practice in D.C."  While I have in fact passed the Maryland Bar Exam, I still have to provide the Maryland Bar with several documents and have a character committee interview before I can be allowed to become a member of the  Maryland  State Bar Association.  If I am allowed to become a member of the Maryland Bar, I must also take a one-day course in December before being sworn in.   Having passed the MPRE (legal ethics) exam and scored sufficiently well on the Multistate portion of the Bar Exam, I will then be able to apply to "waive into" D.C.,  i.e.,  become a member of the D.C. Bar.  If all goes well, I will then be able to, as my brother put it, "practice in D.C."    As for my brother's second point regarding open-source software, he is correct in saying that many people are able to work on labors of love like open source software or, say, weblogs, when they are unemployed, but find it difficult thereafter.  I hope that I will be able to keep this blog relevant and worth reading even when I am a hard-working D.C. attorney, as hard as that may be, and I hope people will like reading about whatever inanities Gabe and I may happen to think up.  Oh, and thanks Gabe for the  urlLink Office Space  reference, after problems with the copier today, I imagined myself as Michael Bolton in Office Space going to town on the non-working piece of office equipment with a baseball bat.

      Andy, my dear brother, just recently got himself a job. He also passed the bar--and can practice in DC. So if you are looking for a lawyer that is fresh and has perspective (cue Fox News music, and send the latest tagline to the bank), maybe you can hire, Andy. A*N*D*Y. (follow with A-Team music).  This brings me directly to my main point which relates the microcosm of my brother's professional life to the macrocosm of the open source software world.  When the economy picks up and programmers get rehired, the average age of open source developers will decrease--meaning it will be mostly teenagers running the show.  I tend to think, that like my brother and myself, guys have pretty much one-track minds (term will be patented soon by Amazon.com as 1-Track (TM)). Once they get a real job, they just fall down on the part time open-source dev job the government had been funding via unemployment in a very round-about way.  Well, in lighter news, Andy found his lucky Swingline red stapler at work again and can be happy now. Although, he is getting moved down to the boiler room.  -Gabe (Guest editorials in the Onion from time to time)

      Though Halliburton admitted to the Pentagon that two KBR (a Halliburton subsidiary) employees were bribed $6 million to give a Kuwaiti company supply contracts and has overcharged the U.S. government, Vice President Cheney still says Halliburton is being " urlLink unfairly maligned " for its association with the Vice President.  I think Halliburton legitimately has a case for saying that some of these actions were by bad apples rather than part of company policy.    But I don't think Halliburton is getting unfavorable press because of its past assocation with Cheney.  I think, in fact, that Cheney's overly supportive comments on the troubles of his former company have actually increased popular scrutiny of Halliburton.  His favorable remarks are being juxtaposed against the damnable actions of the company, creating what many see as a newsworthy contradiction.  If his comments were less supportive, I believe there would be less dissonance between what people are seeing and Cheney's comments, and people would care less.

       urlLink Kay says basically that the WMD did not exist .  He says the non-discovery of WMD isn't fundamentally a political issue, it's an intelligence issue.    I would certainly agree with him that this intelligence failure is something we need to improve not simply through political change but through improvement in our capacities for intelligence gathering and analysis.  However, the Bush Doctrine's emphasis on preemptive war makes solid, verifiable intelligence an absolute necessity.  This, in turn, makes the quality of American intelligence a political issue.    If we can't rely on American intelligence to tell us whether or not other countries threaten us, should preemptive invasion become more or less justified?  My belief (though others are probably just as reasonable) is that preemption or similar action is less justified where America has less information to support claims of WMD aspirations, etc., which will inevitably lead to problems in domestic and international politics.  Interestingly, however, preemption may be more necessary in such situations.  If we cannot discern other countries' leaders intentions, they must be dealt with.  Even more so because modern weapons of mass destruction allow so few to harm so many.  And, returning to the reason for this post, I think everyone should congratulate David Kay for doing a good job, staying honest, and coming out with his hands clean.

      Tom Majhan was a judge and lawyer in Port Townsend, Washington, for most of my life.  My Mom worked for him as a legal secretary for much of that time.  He was the first lawyer I knew and a good guy.  He was a tall, voluble former military man who became a lawyer later in life and would talk about working in the motor pool, growing up Croatian in Pittsburgh and his successful trips to Nevada for gambling with his wife, who predeceased him by only 2 years.    He spoke at the ceremony where I became an Eagle Scout and though I can't claim to have known him well, he always gave me a good impression of the legal profession.  I believe that favorable impression of what lawyers can do is part of the reason why I recently became an attorney myself.   urlLink On January 18, 2004, Tom died of cancer .  It was astonishing how quickly he went from the bench to the hospital and finally to his home to pass away.  He apparently had complained of back pain and when he finally had it checked out, it was discovered that cancer had already consumed his body to a significant extent.  On January 3, Tom was admitted to the hospital in Bremerton, Washington.    My Mom, who moved to Mount Vernon with my Dad when he got a job with Skagit County, went to try to visit Tom in Bremerton, but was unable to see him.  She told me that he was being treated so that he would be comfortable but that there was nothing that could be done.  He died several days later.    Tom was a pillar of the community for my entire life, then suddenly he was gone.  I consider it a reminder of how hard we all have to work to make our mark, so that when we die, people can say our lives were worth something.

Hopefully the Rover isn't stuck on its back like a bug.

      U.S. battles China in  urlLink next space race .  Who wins?  I say China.  "Traitor," you say.  No.  The truth is, the U.S. has little to prove with a space program.  Going to Mars sounds great, but it isn't animated by a need to show that Americans can do great things, that we are technologically superior, or that we won't be threatened as the Space Race was during the Cold War.  On the other hand, Chinese people want very much to show that their country is on a peer level with the great powers and not militarily, economically, and technologically inferior to the West.  It is a civilizational, technological, economic challenge for China.   My bold bet:  China will put a man on Mars by 2020, years before the United States does.  I wonder if we aren't being drawn into some kind of inexorable conflict with China based on realist power struggles and civilizational conflicts.  China is growing in economic power and is increasingly willing to flex its diplomatic muscle, North Korea being the case on point.  It has a large land-based military and is improving its missile technology greatly.  With strong missile technology and proximity to a number of important regions of the world, China will be an important player.  And China's modernization comes with a great many questions about how much its government and social structure will change over the next few years.  Will we have to face a capitalist pseudo-Communist power structure with a powerful military that needs to draw on Chinese nationalism to keep itself in power?  That is a scary prospect.  I think some degree of conflict will be inevitable, though both the United States and China are reaching out to each other now, for the sake of international stability.  And I believe that out of that conflict could grow a mild space race, with the U.S. cast as the aging power taking on a rising China.

      News of  urlLink what's being bought at Sundance :  A "Spinal Tap"-style documentary about Metallica.    Metal!    A movie about Kevin Bacon as a pedophile.

I can just imagine sitting in that movie surrounded by black-clad, studded college kids with little red books reeking of, um, patchouli.  The big movie seems to be "Garden State," starring Zach Braff of "Scrubs," which I like.  That's the movie I'm most likely to see of all of these I've heard about (especially if it gives me an opportunity to make fun of people from New Jersey).

        Camera moves in to focus on Hillary Clinton, who's looking like some kind of grim female terminator.  Suddenly she seems to notice the camera is on her and she breaks into a toothy grin, looking slightly away from the camera.  The smile seems so fake.  I really like Hillary when she talks about serious stuff like foreign policy, health care, etc.  But that fake smile for the camera is very off-putting, even to a Clinton-friendly Democrat.  President Bush's rhetorical zinger:  urlLink "Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year . . . "   [Members of Congress begin to clap, thinking Bush left them an opening to jeer him, but Bush retorts, sternly . . . ]   urlLink "The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the Patriot Act."    President Bush appeared confident, he overcame his flubs without having to resort to any kind of self-effacement, and finished in less than an hour.  The subtext I came away with was, "Look out Democrats.  I'm lean, mean, and now I'm smooth, confident, and ready to debate as well."  Contrast that with the rhetorical self-destruction of Howard Dean, with his widely ridiculed screeching countdown of state primaries on Monday night.  Recall, in particular, how President Bush ran through a list of countries acting with the U.S. in Iraq).  As a Democrat, all I can do is try to imitate Dean's hoarse rallying cry.  But with fear, this time . . . of President Bush being reelected.

      T-minus 2 hours to liftoff for the State of the Union.  I'm eagerly anticipating the President's address to the nation tonight.  Right.  Just like a kick to the groin.  Watching the President flay the English language for 2 hours just makes you wince.  I wonder if David Stout, who wrote  urlLink this article  previewing the speech intentionally put the phrase "stay the course" in the speech to remind SNL fans of that infamous Dana Carvey - Jon Lovitz skit from 1988.  Remember that one?  To quote vaguely from memory, Lovitz as Dukakis and Carvey as Bush Sr. are in a presidential debate and Carvey says: "In conclusion: stay the course - - 1000 points of light - - stay the course."  The moderator turns to Lovitz as Dukakis and says, "Mr. Dukakis, rebuttal?"  "I can't believe I'm losing to this guy," retorts Lovitz, exasperated.  So Stout is subtly tarring the younger Bush with the insults hurled against his father.  At least you probably suspect that if you think the New York Times is part of the vast liberal media conspiracy against conservatives.  Me, I just think it's a funny coincidence that we see the "stay the course" language in the article.

       urlLink Oh come on, David Brooks .  I think you're a good guy and a conservative even a non-conservative like me can like and occasionally even agree with.  But is it really the case that those who believe neo-conservatives are changing American foreign policy are anti-semites?  Are neo-conservatives necessarily Jewish?  I'm not the greatest expert on the topic, but they can't all be.  And merely disliking or disagreeing with a school of thought in which Jewish people are a healthy portion of the significant players doesn't make you anti-semitic.  Weren't a decent number of communist thinkers Jewish?  Does anticommunism make one an anti-semite?  No it doesn't.  And neither does distaste for neocons.  Brooks might counter by emphasizing his op-ed's slant toward those who see neo-conservative conspiracies as latter-day Jewish conspiracy theorists.  But that brush still tars too broadly.  I doubt that even most of those who see neo-con conspiracies to change American foreign policy see it as a Jewish endeavor.  Israel-supportive, I would admit, but not as some kind of Jewish endeavor.  And isn't fervent support of Israel an old-line strong Christian and Republican position?  Come on, DB.  I cheered when you got the NYT gig.  Don't go crazy on me now.

       urlLink The  New York Times  says it's due to lack of quality play or practice matches for reserve players .  To me, this is just trickle-down from a league - MLS - that is still struggling to establish a permanent foothold for national league-quality soccer in the United States.  Until we really get that, the U.S. won't have true international success.  Think about it.  If soccer in the U.S. were like basketball, how do you think we'd do against international competition?  U.S. dominance would be almost assured.  But instead we are a slowly climbing bottom-half-of-the-field country.  So wherever you are, play like crazy, get good kids to play, and support your local MLS team if you want U.S. soccer to grow.  Oh, and on that note, D.C. United games are pretty cheap and you can always get tickets.  So when the season starts up, go, if you live in the D.C. area.

Since then, a redesign and test changes have reduced the risks, researchers said, but some aspects of the X-43A's propulsion and aerodynamic design remain unproven.

      I woke up this morning wondering why it is that I like living in Washington, D.C.  I was tired and had to go into work early to eliminate one line from a document so it could be produced today.  But at lunch, the weather was nice and I got to sit outside at To Market, To Market and talk to Patti, which was great.  As we sat outside and discussed whether you should hold kids back in school or not, there was some kind of rally going on next door to us.  Guys waving green banners.  Trucks were honking as they passed by.  I looked over.  The shirts and banners I saw said AFSCME; apparently it was some union rally.  The truck drivers were probably Teamsters, so that's why they were honking.  If not just for the fun of it.  I told Patti it was a rally, and she said there was some rally going on at GW today.  I recalled that was the case, and something about Kerry getting Dean's endorsement.  Interesting.  This election year is heating up.  I then looked over and saw Warren Rudman, former Senator from New Hampshire, talking to a younger dark-haired guy who shook his hand and got in a cab.  I asked Patti if she had ever seen him on C-SPAN.  She hadn't, but I felt happy to have seen another Washington celebrity, you know, that Commission and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings guy.  As we were about to get up from lunch, however, something odd happened.  A police car pulled up and a guy with an earpiece and sunglasses got out.  A few seconds later, the crowd started getting louder, and then an SUV pulled up and some more suits with earpieces and sunglasses got out.  Then a few seconds later, we saw him.   John F. Kerry, candidate for President , himself.  He looked tan, Patti noted.  She said we'd never see him that close if he got elected.  I thought he looked about the same as he did on TV.  He didn't look wrinkly or weird or anything, like he can sometimes - maybe shadows on TV due to the crazy lights?  He shook a bunch of hands, traffic stopped on that street, and then came over to say "Hi" to the AFSCME crowd.   Patti and I went to our respective workplaces after that.  It's been an odd week for celebrities.  We were in Tryst on Tuesday when an episode of Ambush Makeover was being shot there - big crowds were looking at some guy being done over and his girlfriend or something.  We saw the "after" shots being done out on the street.  Lots of telegenic folks in D.C., apparently.  Wow, it almost makes the drudgery worthwhile.

      I stayed home last night to watch Freddy Adu sub in for the second half of the D.C. United - L.A. Galaxy 1-1 tie.  The good news is, D.C. United looks like a really good team.  L.A. was somehow able to capitalize on a few momentary weaknesses to score, but otherwise D.C. United dominated the proceedings in every category, as far as I could tell.  Shots, time of possession, scoring chances, all went in favor of United.  The bad news is, Freddy Adu is not Pele circa 1956.  He had flashes of brilliance, but he also had flashes of stupidity.  There were at least a few times when a very doable pass would have helped him set himself up for a shot, but he instead drove with the ball straight at a defender and got taken.  Adu also has a tendency to end up on the ground, though there were at least a couple times where he stayed on his feet through a rough tackle.  But my overall take was.  Wow.  This kid is 14, and that good.  That's amazing.  But, unlike Lebron James, who at 18 was able to come in and score and dominate, Adu still is just one guy.  He's not like Jaime Moreno, who by the way, had one run in the box that I just shake my head at, where he took on at least two defenders in succession where he body- and head-faked them out of their shorts.  Adu is good, but no one should expect him to be league MVP this year, or even score a lot of goals.  I think all the criticism of Peter Nowak for not starting Adu is wrong.  The kid needs to grow into the level of play he has to have, and the coach is doing the right thing in starting him off slow, no matter what the public may want.

      Moqtada al-Sadr has retreated into the sanctuary of a mosque in the town of Kufa.  Juan Cole says urlLink  the U.S. may be facing a David Koresh-type standoff  with a charismatic apocalyptic figure in al-Sadr.  My questions:  How will Iraqis react if the U.S. puts al-Sadr under siege?  Will al-Sadr use the mosque to which he has retreated as a fortification from which he can fight off the Americans coming to get him?  If he does, will he be seen as defiling the sanctity of that mosque?  I am recalling hazily the incident some years ago when a radical seized a major holy site in Mecca, which was considered by many to have been a violation of that site's holiness.  Is the U.S.'s best course of action to seize him quickly but somewhat improperly from the mosque, or to risk what will amount to a long, drawn-out hunger strike?  Anybody remember what happened after the IRA hunger strike at the Maze prison in Northern Ireland?  The IRA got publicity, sympathy, and real political power from that action.

At least that's my initial thought.   Or maybe Sistani thought that al-Sadr could do his dirty work - fight the Americans, and when they pull out, Sistani's popularity would allow him to supplant al-Sadr.

      If the U.S. cannot quell disturbances in Iraq and force those opposing them to lay down their arms, will armed and primed Iraqi factions battle it out?  I wonder.    Some article I read today said that almost all Iraqis are in favor of a unitary state.  Does that mean that Shiites and Sunnis think governing Iraq is a zero-sum game,  i.e. , that each group feels it must wrest control from the others in order to be secure in Iraq?

        urlLink "Did Microsoft do wrong?" Paul Saffo, a computer industry consultant who is a director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., asked rhetorically. "Of course. But the wheels of the legal system grind too slow to solve problems in the technology space."  In the wake of Sun backing down against Microsoft, you realize that Microsoft did not only beat Sun or the Department of Justice.    The U.S. legal system has also been beaten.

      What will the U.S. do now that Moqtada Sadr has declared himself firmly and violently against the United States?  The  urlLink current disturbances  cannot last long, but the U.S. is going to have to do something about Sadr's complete unwillingness to cooperate when the U.S. is not willing to leave.  But what would happen if the U.S. were to arrest him?  urlLink  See Juan Cole for more detailed analysis of the disturbances in Iraq .  As for the question of Moqtada Sadr himself, Cole seems to think his turn to fighting the occupation is:   the natural result of the CPA's provocative closing of  Al Hawza   an escalation in jockeying for position after the U.S. turnover on June 30  Cole's analysis of the situation in Najaf, where the Spanish lead a multinational force, is also interesting.  Though I am less circumspect than he is to say that Sadrists in that city fired on the occupiers first.  Why, if some Shiites have decided to fight the occupation, would they still not shoot first, as they may have in the past?

      The IAEA was successful in Iran, though unfortunately IAEA inspectors  urlLink are having problems getting back into the country .  The fact that they uncovered what most everyone now believes was a covert and maybe successful nuclear weapons program means the IAEA inspectors were doing their jobs well.    The IAEA has been so successful of late that proliferators are now actually afraid of its inspectors, and IAEA inspections and attempted inspections are giving us a clearer picture of shape of the nuclear world.  We are now finding out that  urlLink Brazil is probably acting in violation of its NPT and other obligations because Brazil has denied IAEA inspectors access to a sensitive facility  at Resende.  The question I see posed in the Washington Post article on this subject is the right one.  Is the U.S. going to get emphatically behind the now-muscular IAEA and demand Brazil allow inspections?  Even-handedness in supporting thorough inspections in countries reasonably friendly to the United States can go a long way in demanding a halt to nuclear proliferation in North Korea or Iran.  Oh, and by the way, the U.S. should find ways to get the IAEA lots of money and good intelligence.  The IAEA is serving a policing role the United States would otherwise have to fill in preventing proliferation and the IAEA does not draw the kind of ire the United States does.  So U.S. support for the IAEA serves American interests.

      A footnote to  urlLink this article in the Washington Post about the Madrid explosion that killed Abdelmajid yesterday  notes that threats have come in against the Spanish embassy in Egypt unless Spain withdraws its troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.  I think the Islamic militants now see Spain as wavering, after the recent election, and rightly so.  They have therefore decided to attack in this moment of weakness.  Spain's international credibility has been damaged and its citizens are probably in danger abroad.  The terrorists think that harming Spanish interests will force its withdrawal.  This is a textbook example of how a loss of international credibility translates into human and strategic losses.  If Spain could stand up and say that it will not back down in the face of terror, then its credibility and its citizens would not be threatened in this way.  Spanish troops could have left Iraq in a number of ways that did not damage Spain's credibility, but the electoral decision of the Spanish people to throw out the PP and the actions of the new Socialist government in taking a stand for withdrawal led to significant damage to Spain's credibility.  What is most interesting to me, after reading the Cordesman article and the Spanish bombing articles has been the importance of the international perception of domestic popular support for wars by Western democracies.  The terrorists have shrewdly perceived that withdrawal of public support makes international military action unsustainable in the West, and are now trying to recreate the specters of September 11, 2001, Mogadishu, and Vietnam in Iraq.

      The U.S. cannot let a "Mogadishu moment" like the attacks on former Special Forces working as civilian security weaken our resolve because  urlLink Iraq's future, American strategic interests and the international credibility of not just American soldiers, but the American public (at least its tolerance for war and its attending problems) is on the line .  Cordesman is harsh in calling the Bush Administration's planning for war and occupation a "neoconservative fantasy" and a "sick joke," but he is right to say that the future is what is at issue, not the past.  Those who dislike the current Administration but are constructive should focus their thoughts on the way Americans will have to develop military and police forces that will be effective in securing Iraq's future and how the Iraqi economy can be developed, not on how the  casus belli  really did not exist.

       urlLink This article in the NYT about the increasing number of suits for alteration of time records  is very interesting to me for one reason.  I'm actually working on a case that is very similar at a plaintiff-side employment law firm.  Greenhouse's article places much emphasis on the demand for cost-cutting at the branch or franchise manager level, which leads to time record alteration.  I think another concern is the alteration of records to raise costs, to fill up a contract, or to not accurately record leave.  I think cost-raising alterations, especially in collegial offices where the employees' work is done as part of an ongoing contract, can be a significant amount of the cases involving time record alterations.  But Greenhouse is probably correct in putting light on what looks to be a growing trend in the so-called "McJobs" part of the economy.  Though apparently not at McDonald's itself.

      The  urlLink NYT's Madrid bombing article  discuss the role a Tunisian man named Sarhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet played in the bombings.  He is described variously as:  the leader and coordinator of the attacks, quoting Acting Interior Minister Angel Acebesl  a catalyzing agent"  a man who "raised awareness of jihad" among those around him.  I wonder now, in a world where Al Qaeda is more of a loose network rather than a single group, have we stumbled upon a mini-Bin Laden ministering to a small jihadist group of Moroccans in Spain?    More importantly, will the cells of Al Qaeda franchisees that we uncover have such leaders to strengthen the bit players' resolve?  Is Al Qaeda so cult-like that such inspirational leaders are necessary?   urlLink Here is a good article  in the Globe and Mail on the group Abdelmajid led, or leads, depending on whether his death in Madrid is confirmed.

      My first thought in reading about  urlLink the suspects in the Madrid bombings blowing themselves up  was that it was a relatively good way to hamper the Spanish and international investigations into the Madrid bombings and the groups associated with them.    No amount of skilled interrogation or even torture can get a corpse to reveal information, and a massive explosion does a reasonable job of destroying much of the physical and documentary evidence the men probably had in that apartment complex.  I wonder if their actions were simply a dramatic version of standard Islamist extremist bombers following protocol in the event of capture.  And I wonder how it is that so many Palestinians associated with terrorist attacks are in or have survived Israeli jails.  Do Hamas and Hizbollah follow different rules of engagement than the anti-Western Islamists bombers?  I think praise is due for the police in Madrid, who were smart enough to clear the building in which the men were found and neighboring buildings because of the risks the men posed, probably:  that they would have explosives and weapons (because they were bombers); and  that they could kidnap and hold hostage others.  Though the loss of life is sad, the damage appears to have been minimalized through the actions of the police.  I think one thing has been clearly revealed, however.  The Spanish police are on the right track.

      On Monday, Mikhail Saakashvili's party, the National Movement - Democrats, urlLink  have won 76% of the seats contested  in redo of a rigged election that led to the fall of former President Shevardnadze.  He even made inroads in Ajara, the home of his opponent, local boss Aslan Abashizde.  I don't think open conflict is going to be inevitable, though there may be sporadic fighting as Saakashvili moves to take control over his country.  I think the local separatists and corrupt local leaders are going to have to back down in the face of a strong majority in favor of Saakashvili's agenda.  As long as he moves while he still has a honeymoon and the people are still in something like revolutionary fervor, he may be able to sweep his enemies before him without significant violence.    The move for the local bad guys therefore is probably, delay, delay, delay.  Let Saakashvili try to root out corruption and create jobs, let dissatisfaction build.  Then they'll try to reassert themselves.

Now why can't anybody pledge a few dollars to update Hamid Karzai's threads?  Why does he keep wearing the same green and blue robes and wool hat?     Here's Karzai at the recent donors' conference.  Joschka Fischer is looking at him, wondering, "Isn't that the same thing he wore to the last donors' conference?"   And here's Karzai at the White House last year, wearing, you guessed it,  the same blue and green robe .  I really feel bad for the guy, honestly, I do.  I can understand that he's had attempts on his life and that he's constantly traveling for fundraising or burning the midnight oil trying to move his country from abject poverty to somewhat more dignified poverty, and that he can't just wander down to the Kabul Bazaar and check out the latest fashions.  And I can understand if he doesn't trust his wife or kids to shop for him.  I'm a bit like that too.  But Hamid,  you really have to get a new robe.   This one is just played out.  But then again, maybe Karzai is a sneaky devil and wants everyone to notice that he's still wearing a robe that's so last year.  Maybe it helps give the impression that his country is poor and backward and needs funding and help.  If that's the case, then I can see why he wears the old robe.  It does help him bring in the cash.

Marrowstone made the news because of the fight going on there between those who want PUD water piped in and those who want, well, less development and limited water supplies.  I can't really agree with the conserve water faction.  Would they really rather shower with cistern water and let the water table keep dropping?  Are they willing to harm their own quality of life and that of their neighbors to keep Marrowstone for themselves?  I guess I just don't agree with restrictive zoning by proxy.

      Sam Dash, who taught Legal Ethics and other classes at Georgetown University Law Center until recently, urlLink  died today at Washngton Hospital Center .  After hearing what others said about it, I always wished I had taken Dash's Legal Ethics class instead of the 2-credit waste of time I did take.  Everyone who took his class had glowing reviews  Dash, I remember, was the guy who told Ken Starr he was going too far in the Whitewater prosecutions and couldn't take part.  Now it seems clear that Starr was going too far, but at the time, I'm sure it Dash a bit of fortitude to tell Starr he was going down the wrong ethical path.  But enough about Whitewater.  Dash is truly famous because of his involvement in Watergate.  He was Chief Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee and, as I understand it, his questioning on secret tapes led to significant discoveries that led to President Nixon's resignation.  In an odd coincidence, another prominent Watergate figure,  urlLink prosecutor Archibald Cox, died today at 92 .  I remember learning about his firing in the "Saturday Night Massacre" in which Nixon DOJ officials refused to fire him - until Nixon asked future Justice Rehnquist to do it, and Rehnquist did.  When I found that out, I realized where Rehnquist stood on the "politics vs. principle" spectrum.  But anyway, I'm sad to hear that two men of great integrity and legal stature died today.

       urlLink The L.A. Times today has a very long article dated May 23, 2004 , laying out John Kerry's role in VVAW, a veterans' anti-war organization.  The articles' main sources are FBI files kept on Kerry and others in the organization.  It seems that Kerry was able to rise to leadership in the organization because of his speaking ability.  He was able then to parlay his public prominence into a leadership role within the organization.  However, Kerry constantly struggled to work ending the war within an organization that resented his class and officer background and often seemed on the verge of tearing itself apart.  The organization had a a stormy Kansas City meeting monitored by FBI informants where violent action was proposed by one member.  Kerry wouldn't stand for it, and after telling off Al Hubbard, a major leader within VVAW, he essentially left the organization.  Today most of his VVAW colleagues think of him fondly.  However, Kerry apparently wants to distance himself from his radical past and the people he was involved with at that time.   Go see the article for yourself, if you have the time.

       I heard Bowden  urlLink on NPR this morning  regarding his position on the Abu Ghraib tortures.  His position is a good one: torture should not be legal, but a necessity defense is can be made by a man who feels torture is necessary.  The onus would be on the man charged with torture or murder to justify his crime, like a man who commits murder in self-defense.

      OK,  urlLink so now ironing has become an extreme sport .  You can iron while kayaking or rock climbing or maybe while car-surfing or something.  Some even want it to become an  urlLink Olympic sport .  I think I should try to get my Dad into this.  He irons like a pro -- he picks up a steaming iron and in seconds rumpled shirts are wrinkle-free and ready to wear.    As a kid, the story goes, he learned how to iron so well because my Grandma took in laundry at the house and ironing was his job.  I'm sure that's not exactly how the story goes, but I think that's close to how he got so good at ironing.  I'm sure my dad would be a great ironist.  Here are a few websites I found on the subject.    urlLink the Extreme Ironing Bureau     urlLink A BBC Article on extreme ironing     urlLink Extreme Ironing Wikipedia Entry     urlLink Ananova article on efforts to spread the sport in the U.S.     urlLink A Google search on this subject  Makes me think I should start working on my own extreme sport.  Maybe Extreme Slobbery or something.

      I'm watching the  urlLink PBS Newshour  right now and Margaret Warner is interviewing Richard Holbrooke and Kenneth Edelman, and Edelman is being clear, conversational and straightforward, and Holbrooke is droning on and on and answering  none  of Warner's questions.    I looked up to this guy after Dayton, loved reading   urlLink To End A War  , but Holbrooke is being an egotistical blowhard, taking up all the time of the interview, strictly complaining about Bush's failures and offering nothing positive.    At least as far as this interview, Holbrooke has really turned me off.  One of my professors, Teresita Schaffer, formerly a South Asia expert at State and Ambassador to Sri Lanka, mentioned once that she was turned off by Holbrooke.  I wonder now if it isn't because the "me first, your question second" style that he had in this interview is also the way he is in person.

      Josh Marshall says  urlLink Anemic president vs. anemic challenger  = close race.  That's it.  A boring election with lackluster candidates, one of whom still has the war on his side.  I mean, think for two seconds.  If a man with the skill sets of Bill Clinton was the Democratic candidate instead of John Kerry, Bush would be such a lame duck he might as well resign before the election.    I like that Kerry likes to stake out (at least some) middle-ground positions.  But he does not have the rhetorical skill to get the American people to connect with his positions; instead he sounds muddled, at worst, he sounds like a flip-flopping opportunist.  We have two poor communicators for President.  Unfortunately, I think the one with the dumb-as-rocks message will triumph over the one with the confusingly nuanced message.

      I saw  urlLink Fight Club  for the first time last night.  It hits a little too close to home - the kind of movie that while very enjoying to watch, leaves you a bit depressed.    I felt like I could see the screenwriting and the novel through the movie, and it felt very structured, which is probably what was necessary to carry out the big conceit of the movie that you find at the end.  I think I would like Palahniuk's writing; if  urlLink Fight Club  was this good translated onto the screen, his other books are probably great.  The theme of the movie is basically that modern society makes men lonely drudges who cannot release their true selves.  The movie takes a long time to show that letting your repressed anger out and giving in to nihilism is an attractive but ultimately bad idea, but doesn't clearly state whether repudiating societal norms and giving up on joy in ordinary life is an OK answer.  As I think about it more, this movie seems a sadder, angrier, grungier version of  urlLink Office Space , which also came out in 1999.

      I've been reading a bit about the standoff there and Sistani's call for the U.S. and Mahdi Army to both get out of the holiest parts of the city.    The U.S. military should take him up on this.  The U.S. should pull out (maybe to an area outside of which the Sadrists could not properly defend themselves!), and then ask Sistani to demand that the Sadrists move out just as far.  Sistani pushed this course of action, and the weight of his opinion and that of the local population should help push the Mahdi Army out of the city.  If the Sadrists do not move back just as far as the U.S., then I think the U.S. has been very sensitive, and has put in black and white whose fault it is that the U.S. has entered the city if fighting continues there.

      So  urlLink Sarin has been found in a shell rigged as a roadside bomb , which unfortunately exploded, taking away the effectiveness of this as evidence.  My thoughts:  The destruction of the shell means a skeptical Iraqi, Arab, and world public won't believe new U.S. claims of WMD existing in Iraq;  If the plan for the invasion all along was that at least some Iraqi Baathist forces would melt into the populace and become insurgents, secreting the remains of Iraq's chemical weapons with them seems like a reasonable plan;  If the insurgents have some of the chemical weapons, what else do they have?  If the insurgents are the key to the disappeared WMD programs Iraq is believed to have had, won't this require invasive investigative techniques the likes of which will be impossible after the deal reached in Fallujah?  The sarin shell still doesn't make up for the other problems the U.S. had, but if we hadn't mistreated and tortured Iraqi prisoners, we might well have made some headway in public opinion with this discovery.  In light of the prisoner abuse problem, we gain nothing from this discovery. And what kind of follow-up can there be after this discovery?  Will it just remain an enigmatic and tantalizing clue?

       urlLink The  Washington Post  has this right : pulling down all these homes at the edge of the Gaza Strip is horrible stuff, and all the U.S. can do is make little protests.    It seems the Bush Administration has no pull at all with Sharon; in fact, he seems to be manipulating the Bush Administration rather than the other way around.    Did going to Iraq mean writing a blank check to Sharon because we would be too preoccupied with other parts of the Middle East?  I'm sure the Bush Administration truly meant to address Israel/Palestine once it took care of Iraq, but its Iraq transition policy turned out to be mostly just wishing for the best and then hoping for positive spillover effects in the rest of the Middle East.    So it's not unreasonable to say that if the Bush Administration should have known to do a better job of planning and a better job of working for an effective transition in Iraq, it also should have known that President Bush wouldn't be able to take on Israel/Palestine at the same time if Iraq wasn't going well.  So a predictable lack of success in Iraq has, unfortunately, led to a predictable lack of movement in the peace process.

      The FAO  urlLink has written a report that, on balance, strongly supports the promise of biotech crops , if not their current uses.

Now if the U.S. can just get a favorable preliminary ruling from the  EC-Biotech  WTO Panel, the EU will be isolated on this issue and hopefully forced to rethink its agricultural policies.

      The Bush Administration  urlLink is pushing candidates tied to parties .  Probably because the IGC was fully of people without party ties who have turned out to be very unpopular among Iraqis.  But that wasn't what caught my eye in that article.  It was this line:   " . . . . other candidates are being put forward by Kurdish and Shiite leaders, with particular interest focused on another minister who is a prominent Shiite Islamist, Adel Abdul Mehdi.  Mr. Mehdi is described by some Iraqi officials as unacceptable to Sunni leaders, who are said to fear that he might try to impose Islamic law over family matters." I know enough to know that Shiites and Sunnis have significantly different cultures, but it is interesting to me that there are different versions of Islamic law out there.  I had always thought that Saudi Islamists and Iranian conservatives would imagine about the same thing for Islamic government, but this article seems to say that there are different views on this subject.

       The other key factor in the war is Iraqi public opinion. A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found that a majority of Iraqis want the United States to leave immediately. "In Iraq, we are rapidly losing the support of the middle,  urlLink which will enable the insurgency to persist practically indefinitely until our national resolve is worn down ," the senior U.S. military intelligence officer said.    The U.S.'s problem isn't body counts.  It's patience.  We won't stay.  We are not going to stay in Iraq for 10 years, and we are running up against Iraqis who are even less patient than we are - they want us out.    It looks like the best outcome for us is a handover to a dubiously democratic government in a state rife with militias and the potential for sectarian violence.

      Why, if the U.S. government has videos and photos revealing torture, are these sources of information not being released?  I haven't come across anyone yet saying they need to be released.  Down deep, we are all realists.  Whatever the benefit to a democratic and open society to know the evils that it has done, we are all still concerned about the international standing of our country.  We know that this is one of the most serious stains on America's honor since, say, the revelations of the My Lai massacre.  And in a sense it is worse, because of our resort to exporting freedom as the primary basis for the temporary colonization of Iraq.  But in the end, this stuff will come out.  So just put it out there and live with it.  We need to see our shame and face it.

      Everyone I read lately is discussing the Abu Ghraib scandals and I feel like I might as well mention what I think.  I think one of the most serious problems the U.S. had in running a prison system like this is that we are intentionally trying to mistreat prisoners in our prisons in Iraq to force them to disclose information they do not wish to disclose.  In doing this the U.S. has intentionally taken several steps away from simply locking people away and moved toward intentionally trying to harm them.  This is a step away from moral clarity and into gray areas that many people simply have not explored and in which normal moral standards are not extremely helpful.  I think training is extremely important when people are asked to operate in moral gray areas.  Normal guidelines for behavior have been left behind and these soldiers clearly needed to be taught where the line between "gray" pressure techniques and torture can be found.  Of course, of course, what was done here clearly over the line and was abuse of prisoners.  But soldiers have to cross normal boundaries of proper treatment of other human beings to even get close to that line.  It is cold comfort to think that American soldiers' lack of familiarity with pressuring prisoners into breaking or revealing information led them to go too far, but I think it is probably true.  Israelis are often accused of torturing their Palestinian (and other Arab) prisoners, but I think it is a rare occurrence.    Why?  Because Israelis have been in this business for a long time.  Their soldiers almost certainly have the experience and moral standards set for breaking down prisoners to know when they are crossing the line.  They are not morally untethered as the American soldiers in these situations appear to have been.

Though the main Chechen parties have disavowed this attack, it looks like a serious flare-up of guerrilla violence.  These weren't terrorists blowing themselves up.  This looked like a significant military operation, the second in as many days.  If I were Vladimir Putin, I would be very worried.  And I would also be worried if I were young and male in Chechnya.  This looks like the beginnings of another serious crackdown.

They do peacekeeping, they're Muslim, they're nominally a U.S. ally in the war on terror.  Canada, maybe? Paul Martin is much more on Bush's side than Jean Chretien was, plus this is much more straight-up peacekeeping.  Who else, I really don't know.

      The  urlLink new, diplomatically agreed upon UN resolution  on Iraqi transition doesn't mention the Iraqi interim constitution,  urlLink making many Kurds and their leaders angry and anxious .  The Kurds don't like being trampled by the majority Shiites, and it looks like they're unhappy even being treated adversely by the majority that does not appear ready to wrong them.  Their secessionist urges are returning.  But I doubt they'd actually move to secede.  They won't ruin things for their American sponsors.  They can't migrate to take over Kirkuk and Mosul if they return to the old outside-of-Iraq Kurdistan formulation.  And I'm sure the U.S. would not support them if Kurdish withdrawal from the central state means a perception of failure in Iraq.  I am not saying, however, that in the long term the Kurds wouldn't move to secede again.  They are very independent and are averse to the majoritarian moves by Arab Iraqis.  So, my take is this: the Kurds aren't leaving now.  But that doesn't mean I'm certain they'll stay forever.

      When Department of Defense lawyers have to rationalize certain levels of pain as allowable techniques, not torture, you know something is wrong.

      I went to  urlLink Tryst   recently and brought along my laptop and wireless card so I could do some work.  I got the wireless card from Georgetown Law when they were testing out their wireless network and they never asked for it back.  When I came home after having done a little work, I still had my wireless card in the PCMCIA slot, and turning on my laptop, found that there was a wireless network somewhere above.

The choices available to answer this question were:   A) HTSUS 2202.90.9010, which provided for Waters . . . and other nonalcoholic beverages . . . Other, Other, Nonalcoholic beer,   B) HTSUS 2203.00.0060, which provided for Beer made from malt [i]n containers each holding not over 4 liters: Other,   C) HTSUS 2203.00.0030, which provided for Beer made from malt [i]n containers each holding not over 4 liters: [i]n glass containters,   D) HTSUS 2203.00.0090, which provided for Beer made from malt [i]n containers each holding over 4 liters,   E) HTSUS 2202.90.9090, which provided for Waters . . . and other nonalcoholic beverages . . . Other, Other, Other.    See id. ; HTSUS subheadings 2202, 2203.   Kenny answered (C); even though that was the wrong answer, he claimed that the question was too vague because high temperatures could change the alcohol content of the beer.     What B.S. , I thought.  Judge Eaton didn't buy it either.  This guy needs to take the exam again and not waste everyone's time.

      Has anyone considered the possibility that Iran put a fake report on its intelligence communication system that Chalabi had given up the fact that the code was broken?  This would allow Iran to find out whether the U.S. had broken its codes, to discredit Chalabi for its own reasons (which I don't know right now), and sow dissension among American policymakers?  I'll have to look around some more to see if anyone has considered this angle - I'm sure someone has, I just haven't read about it yet.

      According to the IAEA, Iran has changed its story to say centrifuges it claimed to have made  urlLink were in fact imported .  This sounds like another grave failure of U.S. and multilateral export controls.  Just a few days ago, we found that  urlLink Libya received more nuclear munitions components via Turkey , something we never would have learned if Libya hadn't stopped playing rogue state last year.  And you know these kinds of export control lapses are only the tip of the iceberg.    I am scared.
