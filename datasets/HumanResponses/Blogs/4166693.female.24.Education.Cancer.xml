      Post number 30! Everyone dance, now.  But really, I just wanted to wish everyone a great weekend.  I leased an apartment today. My move-in date is set for Sept. 1st. It's not R.'s parents' place, but more on that later.  He was a wonderful, loving boy today and helped me beyond belief. These are the times that I realize how lucky I am. And they are the times that erase anything negative that has come before.  I'll update soon. I have to go to class (ugh!)  Love to all!

      It hasn't been updated in a while, I apologize. I've been spending my time on my blog, really. A lot of my friends stopped using livejournal, so it's not as much fun anymore. However, if you want to read about my life prior to my appearance on blog the address is:   urlLink www.livejournal.com/users/jessic   It had its moments.

      I figure that after last night's post of irritation, I should probably follow up with some form of an update.  Things are better.  I should probably describe my anger management style. It's not as effective as I would like; however, I've been doing it for so long that I don't know any other way to do it. I think it's something I have to work on. My 'style,' as it may be, is very ordinary for a lot of people. I have a high tolerance for people and their bullshit. I can take a lot before I really snap. And usually it takes a while for it to build up to the point where I'm really angry. Such was last night. Since R.'s roomies have moved back in and there have been four people in the house instead of the two of us, I've been slowly fighting the tide of irritation. Last night, after waiting around for an hour and a half for R. to show back up at the house when he was supposed to be home in 30 minutes, I finally snapped. I snapped because my keys were in his pocket, and I was stranded at the house. I snapped because I get tired of babysitting 22 year olds. I snapped because I like to keep things a certain way--clean--and not everyone can do the same. I snapped because after living with my sister for 14 months I expected that briefly living with a bunch of people my age would be an improvement. Mostly, I snapped because when I asked for my keys I was given a smart ass answer, and, honestly, I wasn't in the mood for that crap. So, as you can see, my irritation with not only R., but everyone else in the situation, took a while to grow--about a two weeks. And finally, BOOM!  I did tell him what the problem was, although in a very not happy Jessica voice. It was more like a mid-level yell. I have a hot temper once it gets going, but it only lasts about 10 minutes before puckering out on me. Long fuse, short span of temper, cool down. It's a strange scenario.  Somehow, he always manages to say something that makes me forgive him even if I am still hurt by what he's been doing. Even if it takes about 45 minutes for him to say something like that because he's too busy being defensive and trying to deny things. He gets a lot like his father when someone brings up a problem in a way that doesn't fit the way he wants it done. He gets very stoney and very uppity. He gets a holier than thou attitude that makes me want to kick him in the shins. I point it out to him, and he gets mad about my pointing it out. I'm not the only one that needs to work on things, that's for sure.  We'll make it through the bullshit, but I agree that it's a good idea to still have our own space. I can't live with him right now because living with him would entail living with him and his two roommates. I think what makes that impossible is this:  When it's just the two of us, I know that I am an equal part in the messiness of our house. I know what is mine or what we used those five spoons for, and it doesn't bother me to have a hand in helping to clean things up even though, dispropotionately, I clean much much move often. However, when I come home from work, walk into the kitchen and find someone else's dishes stuffed into every crevice of the sink and their papers all over the table and the refrigerator crammed almost to the point of bursting because it's too hard to organize the shelves so things atually  fit , I don't feel like I should  have  to deal with those things. However, if I don't deal with them (i.e. clean them up, straighten, do dishes) they will sit there and sit there and sit there, untouched and undone until we're out of paper plates and they have to break down and finally lift a finger to wash them. Or until the kitchen smells so much like rotten food that I have to drag my ass out to the trash can at 11 p.m. to stuff it full with the crap that they've left in the house. That's not my job. It's the whole being  their  mom that really bothers me. It's not the helping R. to have a clean house, it's the creating a clean house for my new "family" that's more the issue. Does that make sense? I think, if it had just been the two of us, it would have been a different story.  Last night he said one of those things that made me forgive him in a heartbeat. Well, first, he did the dishes without me saying anything about it. That made me happy. But then, when I was lying on the bed with my head upside down getting that little kid buzz, he came into the room and gave me a funny look and then said the thing that made me forgive him. And now it's getting better.

      Today is my long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long day. I'm in the office from 8-2:45 and then I'm off to the library from 3-8 for class.  Soooo long.  The real excitement was that my class was posted as starting at two different times, both of them listed in the syllabus, and I had no clue when to be there. So, luckily, it's the later time and I don't have to be in class from 12 p.m. - 8 p.m. That would have sucked.  I have to make some phone calls to agencies today to find out what their problems are with the contracts that we submitted.  Otherwise, I am hoping for a liesurely day in the office. Friday's are typically pretty quiet. I hope it stays that way.

      I am  trying  really hard to be okay with living with R. and his roomies. Sometimes, I'm mostly just trying really hard to be okay with living with R. It's difficult to move in with someone, even temporarily, and realize that you aren't really sure anymore if you can see yourself being with them forever because they are doing/saying/acting in a way that really makes you pseudo-hate them from time to time.  Such is tonight. Tonight is a night when I really want to yell "dammit, I want my own place now!" And I really would mean it tonight. I really want my own place. I really want to be away from him right now. Thus, I am sitting in my office at work at 10:12 p.m. on a Thursday night updating my blog instead of spending time reading or relaxing or watching TV at home with R. Reason, you ask? Because I feel underappreciated. Because I'm working my ass off at a new job (or at least working as much as I can with the new students not being here and the programs just getting started) and then I'm coming home to a messy house, nothing taken out for dinner, and the presumption that I am going to do everything that needs to be done there because nobody else seems to want to do it. It's like having a family already, except they're all 20 + years old and they are know better than to leave their milk glasses half-full in the sink so that it curdles and makes me want to yack when I have to wash the dishes (no dishwasher) two days later because no one else has done it. I'm not ready to be someone's mom, nor do I think that I should have to be my boyfriend's mother.  This is the first night this week that I've been able to come home and relax. Or so I thought. Instead, we went out to dinner with his roomies, which was fine, instead of spending time alone. Then, I come home and he goes out with one roomie (the male roomie) to buy a TV quickly at Wal-Mart--quickly being a 1 1/2 hour trip to look at a TV he already knew he was going to buy. So what am I doing? Our laundry. Alone. When they got back, I said I wanted my car keys, which he had taken with him in the roomie's car, so that I could go do something. So what does he do? Stomps down the stairs and in his more arrogant voice tells me that here are my keys, and the place I want to go is open until 11 so I can just go now instead since it took them longer. Pardon? I'm doing his fucking laundry and cleaning up after his mess and their messes, and I'm supposed to be happy that I'm stuck at home without my car? Where in the hell does it turn into a Jessica is a fucker night just because I say I want my keys back?  We had talked about going for ice cream 3 hours earlier. I wanted to go to Dairy Queen for a blizzard because it sounded sooooo good. Instead, they went without me because I am too damned pissed to really want to be near him. I'm on the edge right now. I think, if I see him, I might come undone. And not in a good way. Probably in that going to kill him slowly by sawing through a minor artery with a rusty spoon that would disable him but not kill him kind of way.  And, on top of that, no one I call will answer their phone. I give up with the phone. Apparently, it is an ungrateful apperatus.

      Ohhhh.....my office supplies showed up today! Hooray, hooray! I was so excited. I didn't get the really awesome desk organizer because we're supposed to be getting those when we move to the new Student Union in October. Aside from that, I got everything I wanted. My tape dispenser came in in "putty" which is a blah off-white instead of black like I requested, but I think I might Sharpie it to make it pretty...or putt fabric on it....ohhhh....I might do that! I think I will.  Last day with the freshmen was today. No more "orientation week" activities. I'm a little sad, but I'm glad not to be on my feet in heels for 4 hours straight. That's always nice.  Tonight is laundry night! The only reason I am really excited is that I need the panties desperately. I'm almost out! Ewwww......  Tonight is also easy dinner night. I am either making R. take me out for dinner or we are making sammiches.  Hmmm.....I'm a little sammiched out. Let me explain....  The last three days I have had freshman orientation seminars. All three days they have provided lunch. All three days that "lunch" has been the same sub sammiches from Wal-Mart. Tasty the first day; not so tasty the second day; disappointing the third day. Maybe dinner out would be a good thing for me.  Classes start tomorrow. Hooooo-raaaay!

      Sometimes, it's just best not to title something. So, I am being a rebel.  I watched  The Alamo  last night. Generally, I wasn't too impressed since it was sort of slow and plodding, and a bit predictable as far as some of the interactions between the characters. They had the typical "rally round the captain" moment and the "peace between the conflicting main characters" moment. And that "sentimental because you know they are all going to die" moment. However, the fighting scenes disturbed me a lot.  They didn't disturb me like the scenes in  Saving Private Ryan . That movie disturbed me on a level I never knew existed. I cried the entire first 10 minutes and then proceded to be upset periodically throughout the rest of the film due to certain characters' deaths. It disturbed me in a way where the war was a backdrop to the struggle of a man to survive. Which, I know, is probably wrong, but it was the way in which it was all presented that gave it that feel. It was a man triumphing over adversity sort of thing--surving all odds. That sort of disturbing.  The Alamo  disturbed me in that it brought to light how power hungry we are as humans. Never can we just settle for what we have. Instead, we must run after each other with guns drawn and flags waving trying to dominate someone we find to be inferior. We always think we   deserve   something better than good. Sometimes, we think we deserve something better than great just because. And while the vast majority of the movie was speculation since everyone in the real Alamo died, it was difficult to watch a handful of ragtag men be trampled by a large army simply because the rest of the people were too arrogant to believe that Americans could be defeated.  Perhaps it is most disturbing because I believe that arrogance exists now. I feel as if we, as a country, or at least as a country led by certain powers, believe we are both infallable and invincible. Even after being attacked and wounded on our own turf, we still have the unshakable belief that we are right in the face of all adversity and we are the ones that should be in control of everyone. I look back at our history, and I realize that we've had the same roughian view for more than 200 years. We never learn from our mistakes. We perpetuate them. I'm not a pacifist who believes in being walked all over, but I do believe in taking care of your own. Until we can provide job security, health care, and competitive education for all, we need to focus ourselves a little more on our own reflection in the mirror and a little less on the shadows we claim to see everywhere else.  I figure we'll probably end up killing ourselves with our own stupidity someday. I don't think humans are as smart as they think they are. In fact, judging by every other creature on the planet that lives and breathes peacefully and contentedly with what they have, I think we have a lot more to learn.

      There's a little Yoda figure on my desk. He reminds me that "the force is with you," and that I am a wise and special leader.  Actually, he also makes me wish I was shorter and painted green, but we'll not talk about that.  :)

      Today, I realized the meaning of the term melt-down. My account at work has officially done the melt-down thing. Yesterday, at 2:28 p.m., my account at the university where I work suddenly disappeared. The reason? I am a student at another university in our system, and, with the new software they are using, you are only allowed to have   one   email address in the system. When my internet-based course went through yesterday, the system went "huh?" and switched all my account info over to my grad school info. Poof! No more work account. This means: no more work-related email, no way to get in touch with me unless you call me, and no connection to my calendar! I can't check what I'm supposed to be doing! Ugh.  Thankfully, the IT people are working like mad to get things taken care of. This morning they switched everything back over to my work account, but then the system decided to change my user name. Um, no. And my real name is wrong suddenly. Suddenly, my name is Jennifer. Quoi?  I think computers may already be able to think, and we just don't realize it. I think it is switching my name on purpose. I think it hates me.

      This came about while we were making burritos the other night:  R. shredding a lot of cheese into his burrito, "If I had a restaurant, I would call them constipation burritos because there's so much cheese in them. And no one would disagree with me because they would all be constipated. And I would just sit back and laugh, because, no, I don't have any toilets."  It was the damned funniest thing I think he's ever said. Maybe only surpassed by the time he made me shoot milk out my nose. But I don't remember what comment made me do that, so this is his funniest line to date.

      I love when that happens. Even if you don't really know the friend because you haven't met, it's nice to know that people care about what you do and what you think.  I love my friends. They are all so wonderful.  And I want to learn how to post pictures so that B. doesn't feel as if he needs to say a lot. Pictures are just as important and words. I'd like to share some of my pictures with people. I'll work on that.

      I was able to actually answer some questions for people today. I got to play with the freshmen. I have lots of meetings coming up in the next few days. Classes start on Friday for me (at UMSL). Classes start for the rest of the world on Monday (UMR students).  The shower is fixed.  The washer is fixed.  I have $0.91 in my bank account.  I have a check for $56 on the way.  I'm hungry.  A guy named Dwight posted on my blog entry about sports. Right on, Dwight that I do not know.  I would like to write like Dr. Seuss one day. Maybe. I can't decide either way.  My neck is sore from sleeping funky on the bed to avoid rolling over on Mr. Lance Kitty.  I made my first call to an agency that represents a large, musical act and got....the voicemail. I left a message. It's all good. I feel important at work every once in a while.  Need to dress smart tomorrow--have to be at the directors' meeting to meet lots of new people.  Um......that's all....for now....

      I was thumbing through various blogs, and I came across the blog of a girl who is waaaay into sports. Which I initially think is really wonderful and unconventional. I am into sports in that I watch them, some religiously, and I yell at the TV and hate it when my team loses. I am into sports in that I follow team scores, but I can't tell you who won the World Series in 1956. This girl strikes me as the type of person to be able to name who won the World Series in 1956. This is this super-cool.  Then I notice that she has established her own criteria for what a sport truly is, and in doing so has thrown herself into that whole world of sports snobbery, something I think she was trying to avoid. Her criteria are legitimate, however, she does pose a problem in the following through of the logic. A necessity is a measurable means of winning--faster, stronger, etc. Yet then she mentions that ice dancing is not a sport. I think it is. Unless you've danced--and I mean danced in the form of actual dancing with steps and movement and grace, and not in that boom-chica way where you flail your arms like a monkey on speed on a dance floor--you have no idea how strenuous it can be. It is an amazing form of exercise, and it takes a lot of practice to get good at it. Besides, if you dance well enough, you'll be sore the next day from using all the muscles you never thought you had. Ever seen any of the guys that swing dance well? Yeah, muscles. It's a hard, hard thing to lift your partner and swing them around. It's even harder to effectively lead your partner. So take dancing, any kind you want that does not fall into the fake-tribal dancing genre, and put it on skates! That, my friend, is a sport. That is freakin' hard. I think it matters if you're faster, stronger, and more precise than other ice dancers. It's a need to be those things if you want to win. I think that declaring it a non-sport is snobbery. Especially, if you're going to place curling on your list of sports, but negate ice dancing or synchronized diving. Curling--a sport in which you slide a heavy barbell down an ice lane by using small brooms to brush snow chunks out of the way.   Last I checked, you needed to be an athlete to jump off a 25-foot platform and do four twists and spins in the air before landing straight up and down like a straw in a giant pool of water. I know I couldn't do it. If it isn't a sport shouldn't everyone have some ability to do it? Hmmm.....

      I plan on using it to call people. Last night was crazy with the phone. Well, first of all, my parents called which is always a detailed conversation about what I'm up to and what work has been like and if I have a place yet and etc. So, I had one of those. Then, A. called to check up on me, talk about current job opportunities, and relay wedding plans for the upcoming week. Then, J. called to talk about school, discipline issues, and lesson plans. I liked talking to everyone, but I was about wore out! Heehee. I think it was just the mellowness of Chinese food and the Olympics that truly wore me out. That and the fact that I took the opportunity of watching the Olympics to pull out some crazy kung-fu moves on R. I don't think he appreciated being "chopped" across the arm or having me pummel his legs. I bruised my arm. I think it's some form of cosmic retribution for rough housing too much.  But anyway.....  I will call you if I haven't already, I promise!

      I forgot about this until I burped. I know that is sooooo gross, but it was nasty then so the recurring nastiness just makes it worse. I had a grilled cheese and salad from the cafeteria for lunch. The grilled cheese? Oh, so good! I was in Heaven. The salad? Not so good. And here is where we get to the nasty cheese.  The salad had what appeared to be nice, yellowish orange cheese on top. I'm thinking, "Mmmm cheddar" because I am such a cheese freak. R. says I was a mouse in a former life. Anyway. I take a nibble, and, oh God, the horror! It had this powdery texture on the outside that reminded me of how latex gloves feel on the inside. Ewww. Then, to make it worse, the cheese tasted faintly of cheddar but more like really rotten bacon flavoring. Gross! I wanted to yack. For real.  To make it worse, the tomato and the cucumber both had hints of nastiness to them as well. I can't place it, but it was almost a meaty flavor that frightened me since they are veggies.  Oh...I'm shivering just thinking of how gross it was!

      I had a conversation with a friend the other day where she really bashed blogging. She thinks it's a stupid thing to do because it allows people to psuedo-stalk other people. Her reasoning makes sense, I guess, since people can read what you write and never post. However, when you write it you know people are going to read it that you don't necessarily know, so it's really more about publishing your words without the copyright. You want people to read about your life if you post. Or you want to let specific people read about your life, at least. Either way, it's like a diary that you can share without fear of retaliation or mockery. It's something I sort of have come to enjoy.  I know that she is bitter because of personal reasons which incorporate blogging but aren't necessarily typical of it. However, I found it somewhat offensive that she insinuated that all people who blog are stalkers. I'm not stalking anyone! Besides, the people that I communicate through the writing I do here have all had wonderful things to say. I enjoy their comments and their insights. I appreciate that they communicate back to me. It's fun. And, let's face it, one of them makes my friend light up like I've never seen before, so that's just phenomenal.  Blah to being negative....

      That is what the band Emerson Drive (they're country if you aren't familiar with them) is considered according to the tax forms we received as part of their contract with UMR for the fall concert. Okay, that's fine.  Here's the problem--the way the UM System pays people who are non-resident aliens is much different since they still have to pay taxes, but aren't really citizens.  Emerson Drive doesn't want to pay taxes. Thus, our options right now are this:  1. Every band member fills out a bunch of paperwork and gives us a bunch of documentation regarding their legal citizenship status, and then the University figures out tax payment from there. Effectively: lots of legal paperwork to end up not paying taxes since they aren't residents.  2. We, the Student Union Board, mark up the amount we are paying them to cover their taxes. Effectively: SUB pays an extra 30% on their contracted amount, which is a lot, to pay their taxes for them.  Here's the hitch. The group doesn't want to do the paperwork mumbo jumbo because they said they never had to do it before. The students don't want to pay another 30% for the show that they have already contracted in for. Which leads us to the last option.  The band pays their taxes and then files their income taxes in April and gets it all back.  Why do I tell you all this? Because I am in charge of figuring out what the solution is going to be.  Ugh!  But non-resident alien is fun to say.....

      Today, I have to be a decision maker. This frightens me a little because typically I am a very indecisive person when it comes to minor choices. Major choices I'm only slightly better with. Mostly, I like to avoid making the decision until the last possible second, or until the party that is vested in the event with me flips out and forces me to choose. This is not to say that I don't have a strong opinion about things. I think it just highlights my incessant need to be a procrastinator. However, today, I have no option to do so.  A little run down on Rolla, MO. First of all, it has a population of about 14,000 people. This includes the fact that Rolla is a college town. If there weren't a college here, I would estimate the population to be roughly that of my home town, Cedar Hill, at about 6-7,000. It's quaint. But when you take the quaintness and add into it the fact that UMR has reduced the number of credit hours required to move off campus to 45, you have a problem. I moved to Rolla about a week ago. I've been to two realty places in the last weekend. The prognosis is not good.  Investment Realty has 3 apartments left in all of Rolla. One is a total shit hole, and I wouldn't wish living there upon a snake. And I hate snakies, so go figure how much I like the idea of a person living there. It was really dark, very super small, and had the type of people living around it that remind you of drug dealers or mental patients. Plus, there was the lingering smell of food in the apartment and outside of the buildings. The kind of food that smells old and rotten. The kind of food that makes me think of nursing homes. The kind of food that people shouldn't force other people to smell, let alone, eat. I immediately thought, "Oh, hell no." Did I mention that the "driveway" to get to it is really nothing more than an alley between the bowling alley and McDonalds? Yeah....not going to live there.  The second apartment and third apartment are very close to each other in make/model. They were nice. One was set up much like a duplex would be except it only had one floor. It was spacey for a 1 bedroom. It was nice. I liked how it was bright and had vaulted ceilings. The only thing that made me cringe was that the back door was in the bedroom. Made me a little nervous. The second place was much like the first, except it was upstairs and had no vaulted ceilings. I liked that there was no back door, especially in the bedroom, and it had a nice view of a lake with ducks on it. I liked that a lot. I wouldn't mind either of them.  Here's the dum dum dum part. Investment Realty is leasing these places starting in September, however, they are requiring the deposit immediately. They said that they expected the two to go within a day or so. Additionally, they said that they couldn't hold it for me even if I thought I would maybe take it. Either I put money down then or they rented it out to someone else. Made me sad.  I also called Century 21 Realty. They have one and only one apartment left in Rolla. It's a 1 bedroom, $250 a month, NO pets. Once again, money now or no move in.  There's only one other realty company in town. This poses some serious problems, or so I believe.  I thought maybe the "moving expenses" that UMR offered to pay would include a deposit on an apartment. Sounds like a moving expense to me! Nope. It only covers mileage and gas and a U-Haul. No meals. No deposit on an apartment. If you don't have the cash, too bad. Sucks. I'm a poor, poor girl right now. I think I have about $75 to my name. I was living all summer off the fruits of my springtime labor--i.e. Substitute Teaching--and that started to run out long before I actually had this job. I get paid once a month since I am salaried, so the 31st can't get here fast enough.  Here's the light in the dark with a little shadow thrown in. There is an apartment that is available that I'm almost 95% sure that I can have. R.'s parents own two houses down here. One, he lives in with two roomies. The other is split into an upstairs apartment and a basement apartment. Guess which one is open? The basement, of course. That is the "little shadow" part. It's very spacious--a full basement turned into an apartment--so that's great. A little too warm for me since the people upstairs don't like to keep it quite as cool as I'd like, but I can invest in fans. I was totally against it at first because it wasn't my dream apartment. However, I have to be practical. It has a lot of space, and Stitch can come live with me comfortably without extra rent. R.'s parents said I can paint it however I want to paint it, which allows me to dream about Trading Spaces-esque paint techniques and color palates. It'd be easy to move my stuff in since it's on a ground level. I could do a lot with hologen lamps and candles for mood. And, above all, it's cheaper than what I would get elsewhere because they know me. So, I have to make my decision tonight or else R.'s parents are putting it up on the market this Wednesday and I'll have no place to live.  It's a little stressful to be looking for housing in a college town at the beginning of their school year when you have no money. I've been freaking out, but, on the flip side, if I can get the apartment for September, I can spend the next few weeks/weekends over there painting and scrubbing and making it look the way I want it to look. That would be nice. I'm a little more relaxed. I'll be even more relaxed if they say "Yes!," and I know that it is mine.  Wish me luck.

      I suppose that I should start this post off with a disclaimer.   Disclaimer:   I still love my boyfriend even if he is the most forgetful idiot sometimes. I'm sure that I also render myself a fool from time to time (an instance with a particular brand of donut comes to mind), so I cannot harbor ill-will toward him for long.      Now, here's the reality of things.  My morning was a morning from hell. And not just in that woke up late and feel hung over sort of way. No, no, no. It was much more in that nothing can go right way that makes you feel like laughing and crying at the exact same time much to your own dismay. It was one of those mornings that starts off with a bad night that just circles its way into the rest of your day. Let's start from the beginning.  Crawled into bed at about 11 p.m. last night after a long, hard night of playing  Mario Kart .   I was ready to hit the sack something awful. I pull back the covers, turn on the fan and jump into bed while R. putzes around the house turning off lights and avoiding tripping over the cat. He crawls into bed a few minutes later and hits the lights after setting the alarm clock to 6:45 a.m. Kat, his new roomie, has moved in and has to be at work at 8 a.m., so I need to be up a little earlier to get in the shower and get ready for my 8 a.m. day. Hence, the alarm being set earlier than usual. I pass out cold within ten minutes. I am woken up about ten minutes after that to R. yelling at the cat to get off the desk. He jumps up and throws him on the floor. I mumble nasty things about stupid cat and go back to sleep.  I wake up at 2:00 having to pee like you wouldn't believe. I attribute it to the diet Dr. Pepper and stumble to the bathroom, all the way cursing my need to drink soda that late at night. I flush, the toilet decides not to wash the toilet paper down, as it often does if don't hold the handle for precisely the right amount of time before washing your hands, and I say "screw it" and shut the lid. Whatever. I'm gross, sue me. I crawl back into bed, arrange myself next to R. and around the cat, and fall back asleep.  Train rumbles through about 3 or so and Lance, our cat, decides that this is his cue to be bitchy. Mroew...meoroow.... Scratch on the bed. Turn in circles. Jump on me. He tries to physically push his way in between my hip and R.'s even though there is only enough space for maybe one of his legs. I grumble and push him away. He licks my leg and lays back down. Fall back asleep.  Lance decides it's 5 a.m., so he better wake us up again. This time, he scratches at the door and meows loudly. He's being ten different kinds of obnoxious. I want to kick him. R. throws him out the door and shuts it, but it's too late. I have to pee again. More cursing of the Dr. Pepper and some cursing of the cat. Back to bed. Sleep. Lance pushes the door open and runs into the room to start his crap again. Meowing and jumping around and nuzzling your face to wake you up. It's 5:15 a.m.! I don't have time for this. R. throws him out again and pushes the door closed then puts a chair in front of it. Sometimes it latches, sometimes not. Hence, Lance getting in when we shut it earlier. I mumble something about setting the alarm for 6:55 because I need the extra ten minutes. I hear the beep beep beep of the alarm buttons and R. rolls over to tell me it's changed.  Sunshine on my face. What time is it? HONK HONK HONK. The neighbor gets his morning wake up from the guy out front. He always honks at..... dammit, R. what time is it? Um, 7:05 a.m. What happened to the alarm; it didn't go off! Oh....I, um, I set it for 7:55 (I have to be at work at 8 a.m., remember?) Jump out of bed, throw back the covers on his side so he is cold and has to get up. Stomp to the bathroom. I grab my toothbrush and brush like a mad woman. Then head upstairs to Clay's apartment to shower since the bathroom downstairs is still in disrepair a week after we got there. The toilet up there has no water. What the hell? Oh, R. turned it off to fix something. I try to get in the shower. No water there. R. turned it off when they fixed the pipe yesterday afternoon. He turns it back on. I turn the water on. White chunks fly out of the faucet and the room suddenly smells like acetone. They used acetone to fix it, but it should be dry. I'm going to smell either like dirty person or acetone. Hmmm...I let it run for a minute more and then just jump in. No time to shave the legs, I'll wear pants.  Hop out of the shower and head downstairs in my towel. Meet Kat on the stairs going up to shower and apologize quickly for the tardiness. Start to throw on clothes. Blow dry hair. Style. Put on make-up. Realize that I'm still a little bit on time. Run down to the basement to grab a few decorations for my desk. Grab three picture frames (w/pictures), my diplomas from MU, and my Yoda figurine. Throw them into a bag. Grab my insurance paperwork. R.'s made me a bagel with cream cheese. Yum. He's also given me $6 for lunch since I had no time to make my lunch this morning. Yay.  I realize I can't find my keys. R. had them last for the run for chili powder yesterday evening. I ask him where they are. He can't find them in his jeans' pockets or on the desk. I assume he locked them in the car, but that's okay because my driver side window will go down if you push on it a little. I run outside. Door is unlocked--that's not good. Keys are in the ignition--um, really not good unless you want your car stolen. I show him my most steely look. I throw the stuff in the car, retrieve my bagel from him, and give him a quick peck. I turn the key in the ignition and realize it doesn't have to turn very far. Quoi? I look down. Yeah, it's been on all night long. The key was facing in the forward "on" place that isn't really on, but lets your radio work anyway. What the hell? My battery is dead! Dammit, R.! What were you doing? He frantically calls everyone in Rolla that he knows, all three of them right now. Kat's left already. No one is answering. I look at my cell for the time. 8:13 a.m. I was supposed to be there at 8 a.m. It's only my 5th day. Growl. Growl. Growl. I grab my stuff and start marching up the sidewalk--I have to walk, blister on my foot from yesterday's shoes and all. (A string of nasty curse words is going through my head at this time, but I'm too much of a lady to share them all). R. chases after me. I turn around and give him my most deadly look. He puts out his bottom lip and gets the puppy eyes. I crack a smile. Argh!!! And I wanted to be mad.  I got to work at 8:23. Not too late. Still, it sucked. I have officially been offered a nice dinner/ movie night for my trouble this morning. And it's all because of Robo. At least that's what he said. It was just one of those mornings that you expect on a Monday but not on a Friday. Although it is Friday the 13th. Maybe there is such a thing as bad luck. Or, as R. likes to say, it was a miracle. God made me late this morning on purpose because he didn't want anything bad to happen to me and it might have if I had actually gotten out of the house on time. Whatever it was, it was irritating at the time. Although it has the funny angle now. Hmmm....  I need to do some work. I'm outta here for now.

      I'm going to stay a few minutes late today so that I can actually post a few things that are intriguing. Or maybe just a few things that are....  Spent the day in meetings and meeting people. Worked with a few of my SUB (Student Union Board) students today which was awesome. I think I'll have a good relationship with them as long as I clarify that I am learning, too, and that we need to work together. They're all really nice, somewhat quiet, but nice and very smart. I'm glad I have a great group to lead me through the ins and outs of SUB for a while.  I didn't decorate my desk at all. I was going to, really, but I got so sidetracked with working on other things and going to meetings that it all got lost in the mix. Tomorrow is my work "me" day, so I will do it then. I have things on the schedule, but they aren't too much, so I should be able to do a little of everything I feel I need to do. More work with the students tomorrow. Some student meetings. Good things.  I have apartment hunting on my list of "to dos" for Saturday. I looked at R.'s parents' place, and though it's okay, it's totally my back up. I'd rather live in an apartment apartment. Not in the basement. Does that make sense? It's very dark and warm (which is weird for a basement) and reminded me of many creepy movies I have seen in some ways. I can't describe it really. I wish I could. So looking at places is on my list of things that must get done. I hope I can find a nice place that accepts pets. I have to bring my cat down here, so I have to find a pet friendly place that isn't a shit hole. Good luck, right?  I received my first graduate class A- and B+. They hurt a little. I worked really hard in those classes and thought I deserved a little better. Somehow, UMSL is still calculating my GPA at 4.0. I don't know how that works, but I can't complain. I hope that it's not just fostering false hope. The jerks. I'll survive without the 4.0, but it will be hard on my fragile ego.  I miss my friends and my family. I really miss Amanda and Jessica. They seem too far away. My family is more of just a longing for a hug from my mom and not really a want to move back in sort of feeling. I'm okay not living there. I want to see them soon. And I do miss Rachel even though she was driving me nuts before I moved out. I miss her quirkiness and her cracking me up with her strangeness. It's a weird combination of love and hate with us sometimes, but I love her a lot and I miss her. And I also miss talking to Bruce. I used to talk to him every day, and now, with no internet access at home, I can't. It's sad. I should call, but I'm bad with the phone and I don't like to interrupt. That's probably why I don't really call. I should, though, only with permission.  An office supply club is in the works. Keep watching for details.  Hmmm..what else? Staff shirt day tomorrow. And chili for dinner tonight. I'm outta here!

      Once again, I am sitting here at work contemplating things to do. I know that tomorrow will be really hectic. Tomorrow I learn PeopleSoft, a new database program, and I go over how to reconcile my university credit card. I also have my first staff meeting. I also learn how to edit contracts with our campus performers. All in all, there is a lot going on tomorrow. It makes me only  slightly  nervous.  Friday is my day to run my own day. I know that I have a meeting with Dustin, a rep for the BSU, to go over plans for their upcoming concert. I'm not sure if they realize that using the Rec Center actually requires spending $3000 on set up and removal. I'm not sure how they are paying for their event. I'm not even sure if they are planning on going through the box office for tickets (another $1000). I do know that this is my first non-SUB event. This is also the first event that I get to handle all on my own. It's really quite unnerving. I would like to meet with my SUB director who is handling the Emerson Drive concert in October so that I can get some specifics. I might see what I can scrounge up for a meeting with him on Friday. Just so that I am in the know. I have my first event to attend on Sunday. It's a big week with lots of big events.  Next week is freshman orientation week. I have three solid days of academic events in the mid-morning/early afternoon. In addition, I have staff meetings, CPAS meetings, Homecoming meetings, etc. Now, not all of those will necessarily take place next week, but a good portion of them may. Then I have evening events that I have to attend. And weekend events. The only nice part of that is that I get to come in late/take time off during the week to balance everything out. I wouldn't want to work 60-75 hours a week! No way!  I think tomorrow is also decorate my desk day. I'm bringing in some supplies from home. Pictures, pens and pencils, etc. Then my office supplies come in on Friday or Monday! Hooray. I put down about 11 things that I wanted to decorate my side of the room. I can't wait until I get my real office in October. A real room with four walls and a door. This is a real room, too, but it's much more open and not private. Not that I am a super private person, but to have some escape space would be nice.  Wal-Mart run is on the agenda for tonight. Hopefully, by the time I get home at 4:30, the shower will be fixed. That'd be nice. Right now it is really not working at all. Neither is the washing machine. Or the dryer really. It was a list of many problems when we arrived on Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, R. has handled everything splendidly and allowed me to be mostly mellow this week. I get really crabby at the cat in the morning. Mostly because he's an ass this week. Meowing all the time in a bitchy-cat way. He likes to meow loudly at me at night when I move even the slightest bit. I feel like saying, "Screw you cat! You sleep all day while I work. I don't care if you're comfortable." Maybe I should say it.  Life is good. I wish I could comment on conversations with people or on my social life, but other than R. and I talking about cleaning or making dinner, there's not been much social about my life. Mostly just work. But that is what the first week is all about. I like it a lot. The day goes by really fast..... really fast.  Okay, I'm out. I'll post something decent here eventually.

      Sitting here at work killing time while my boss, Paul, is off doing something highly important in the Student Life field. I feel the need to be doing some important, however, I am posting here on my blog. Maybe it's important to some people. I did get to pick out office supplies today! Hooray for that. I love,   LOVE  , office supplies. I love looking at them. I love touching them. I adore buying them.  I am such a nerd.  I need to go home and grab some lunch, actually. It's a good plan. Whether or not I follow through right now has yet to be determined.  Hmmm....  My boss has a meeting at 1 p.m., and Katie, the support staff, will be downstairs at the front desk, so I'll be all alone in my little room of doom. I wish I'd brought my desk decorations. I could have been doing something constructive with those. Note for tomorrow--bring desk decoration and files. Yeah.  I'm turning into a boring girl. I'll post something important soon. I promise.

      Second day of work--spelndiforous. I'm meeting waaaay too many new people, but at least I feel all official about it. The people are tremendous. I love them already. So much fun. I'm really excited about my SUB students; they are so independent and cool so far. I'm really pumped about my first activity as Student Advisor. I have to be at the comedy night Sunday night. That means I have to supervise so that our comedy guy doesn't light himself on fire. Fun, eh?  I'm being placed in a position with a lot of responsibility. I serve on 10 committees. That's just a fraction of what I have to do. However, it's going to be such a challenge that I'm going to love it. I know I will. I always have loved being stretched to the limit.  I need to get out of the office. It's already almost 5 p.m. That means, I'm staying a 1/2 hour later than I need to. I'm supposed to be looking at an apartment soon. I'll post more later.

      And that is all there is to say about my days of packing. Finished. Hooray.  Now, all I need to do is crawl onto the couch and watch some TV before hitting the sack with Monty. Monty would be my stuffed moose, ya'll.  How many people can say they have a ginormous stuffed moose from Colorado? Hmmm...if there are a lot of you, then I suddenly feel in good company. If there aren't, then I feel like an individual.  Note to self--do not forget your Gamecube when you leave tomorrow. Bad idea.  G'night all. I'm outta here....

      I'm not quite sure if I'm going to be keeping with this blog or not. Ideally, I just want to have it so that I can comment on all of your blogs without having to hit anonymous and add length to my post by signing my name. It's just a hassle. Although, my livejournal doesn't get read that often, so I might just connect my posts or consolidate down to one.  I'm not sure.  I should probably figure that out.  I'm avoiding packing. Let's be honest. I just don't want to pack anything else. And the big packing issue at the moment is that I need to pack my shoes. Ugh. Too many. Too much work. I want to sleep or watch TV. I'm a lazy ass.  I hope everyone is having a good weekend. Especially, two people that I know (or know of).  Okay, enough of this. I'm off to pack.
