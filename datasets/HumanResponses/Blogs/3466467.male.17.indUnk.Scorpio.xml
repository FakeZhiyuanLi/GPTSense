      Yesterday was extremely confusing to me.  I tried talking with her, but no, I guess it wasn't appropriate at the time or something along those lines.  She wouldn't talk to me.  I sat with my buddy, and she became very angry at me.  It's funny.  But oh well.  Like I've said before, time will heal things.  I FIXED MY GUITAR!  I finally got a high e for my SGX.  It's about time.  I feel complete again.  Haha.  I love that guitar with a passion.  If it was my choice, I'd have about ten of those things.  Now I can start practicing with some of my pals, and possibly get this group thing going.  It'll be nice to finally get that going.  Most of us agreed that a mix of blues and ska would suit our personalities.  It should be fun.  I've been trying to figure out how to get music on this thing.  If anyone knows how, please tell me because I would like to know.  Time to go, in class.  Will talk more later.  Will work for food.  I'm extra, extra hungry.

      Well I figured that I might as well change  everything  about me as long as I was planning on changing.  I figured I would change the type of journal I use, my profile, maybe my screen name.  I'm not quite sure yet.  This is all possible thanks to a relationship gone wrong.  I don't quite know where I'm at right now as far as relationships.  I know that I've been working my ass off to be with Cynthia, but everyone's against it.  I don't even know if I'm ready for it anymore.  It seems like I need to give it more time and figure out a couple of things.  Time will help me figure things out.  It always has.  For the most part things have been going well for me lately.  The high e on my guitar broke for the second time within a month or so, but I'll live (hopefully).  That guitar means alot to me.  It's a Gibson SGX; sea-foam green with tortise shell everywhere.  It's a beautiful guitar.  Once I get a digital camera I'll take some pics and leave some on here so everyone can be envious.  Haha.  It's got great tone too.  The thing is just bad ass.  I can't wait to fix it up.  The ol' Danelectro just doesn't cut it.  I've got to have the power again.  Haha.  I'll be strummin' again soon enough.  So I'm stuck between things right now.  Has anyone ever felt torn between two different things?  A feeling like you're someone else when you're with one of the different things?  I'm that way right now.  I feel like a different person with each of them.  That can get confusing at times.  This is why I don't think I'm quite ready to make any sort of commitments.  We'll see how things play out.
