      I found this survey on another blog that asks you a few questions and then identifies you as one of the cool 80's toys that we all played with as kids.  As a child of the 80's who had most of the possible toys on the list, this survey is one of the coolest out there.  So My Little Pony might be a little whimpy, but I love My Little Pony, for one, and I'm not changing my answers!  (So there!)  I even had the the castle that they've displayed the pony in for the picture!  Let's try this!  Take the survey, find out what you are and post it under my comments, so we can see who our friends really are!  It'll be fun!  You know what I am!  :)   You're My Little Pony!!  Sweet and innocent and happy, you make people want to spew burrito chunks.  Even a Care Bear could kick your ass.     urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Yay!   urlLink Rachel's  blog has been found and the blognappers caught!  We can all breathe a sigh of relief...aahh.  I forgot to also post  urlLink Thuy's  blog, as she was the one who originally inspired me to create mine in the first place.  Thanks Thuy!  By the way, if you were at Monday night's Java Station group, you now know who firedude is...Shall I keep you in suspense?  Maybe just for a little while.  *evil grin*  >:}  I'm off to get ready to go to the library.  I'll check in later.

      I'm feeling very concerned tonight about  urlLink Rachel's  blog.  Her totally cool blog has apparently taken a vacation from reality and disappeared.  She doesn't seem to know where it's gone either!  Very tragic.  Rachel has been completing knitting projects at lightning speed lately, and I wonder what it has to be doing to her, not being able to post...  If you see or hear from Rachel's blog in the near future, can you let her or me know at your soonest possible convenience?  Much appreciated!  :)

      In other news, I had a very strange dream last night.  I dreamt I was married to a 500lb woman, and we were in a hotel room with our son, who was jealous of a Pinocchio marionette I have.  He kept throwing it down onto a file cabinet and pouting.  My wife, who I didn't like very much and couldn't figure out why I was married to, kept eating all the good strawberries off a plate and leaving me the moldy ones...HUH?!!  OK-If there is someone who interprets dreams, can you maybe enlighten me a little about this one.  (Maybe I don't want to know?)  The phone rang at 5:00am and woke me up from this dream, and I had a REALLY hard time falling back to sleep afterward.   urlLink    Strange Dreams&nbsp; urlLink     Being tired today, I'm sure I'll sleep better tonight.  Now, off to class I go.

      I made it to the Java Station last night, for the first time, and I couldn't believe how many people were there!  Everybody was of different ages and skill-level, and there was a huge amount of sharing techniques and drooling over each other's projects.  It was so fun!  I took my newly-finished poncho to show off and it was a hit.  (I still need to to get Greg to take a picture of me in it to post.)  Who knew such an easy project would draw so much attention?   urlLink    Here's the Monday night Java Station group.  It's, unfortunately, very dark in there, but you get the gist.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Super cute teddy bear one of the girls needed advice on for the face.  Just adorable!&nbsp; urlLink    We all decided this teddy needed button eyes vs. embroidered ones.  He was so cute, and will make the perfect addition to the matching infant teddy bear outfit this knitter made (Sorry, I didn't get her name.  Too many people to remember!).  So, this is one of my current projects.  I am making a toddler's cardigan that originally called for stripes in Debbie Bliss'  Easy Knits .  I'm making it all one color, except maybe the edging, where the buttonholes go.  We'll see.  Here are a couple pics:  urlLink    Striped Garter Stitch Jacket&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Striped Garter Stitch Jacket&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    First-person view of my WIP(work in progress).  It will be a child's sweater and is my test to see whether I'm ready to make one for myself.&nbsp; urlLink     I have a long way to go, so it will be interesting to track how long this sweater will take.  I'll have to come up with some really simple, quick projects to help me fill in the boredom spaces with all this garter stitch.

      Well, I didn't think I would post again today, but a healing quilt that I contributed to for a cancer patient from  urlLink knittersreview.com  has finally been put together.  Pictures of it have been posted, and it will now be sent to Georgia with all of our prayers knitted in.  Don't you think it's gorgeous?  Thanks to Jolene and Pam for putting it together for us at Knitter's Review!  I hope that Georgia is able to benefit from its warmth and comfort soon.  urlLink    It's finished!

      OK.  Well, for some reason I thought I had way more pictures of my knitting, but apparently not.  I've certainly made a lot more items, but I guess I didn't take pictures of them.  Dang it!  So can I ask a big favor of those of you who have received knitted gifts from me...If you have a digital pic...Can you email it to me at my netscape address?  If you don't have it, let me know, and I'll send it to you.  Thanks!  The reason I thought I'd have more pics is because I was writing a list of my FO's (Finished Objects), and it got pretty long.  Here's the rundown:  -6 scarves -4 baby hats -3 beanies -2 baby blankets -2 dishcloths -1 purse -1 pair of baby booties -1 pair of slippers -1 coin purse -AND A PONCHO IN A PEAR TREE!  Sorry.  With all these things that I've worked so hard on, I can't believe I allowed most of them to go out the door without a decent picture!  >:(  So here are a few pics of things that I've done...   This was one of the first dificult things I've made.  Making two identical knitted objects is not easy. I took apart the second bootie about four times, trying to get it right.  This is also the first project that I had to pick up stitches on.  I ended up using a wider, sheer, pink ribbon instead because the ribbon in the picture was too narrow and slippery.  It kept coming undone.  They turned out so cute!  urlLink    Bootylicious!&nbsp; urlLink     This purse turned out just the right size for a 2 year-old little girl to put her barrettes and coins in.  I've heard Hannah carries it all over the house wearing Kristi's scarf and hat set that was sent in the same package.  :)  I love that!  urlLink    Coin purse pattern that I altered to make into a real purse for Hannah.&nbsp; urlLink     This is the baby hat from  Stitch and Bitch .  I added the little button on a whim, and just fell in love with the first one, so I made two more.  They require next to no yarn, but they do come out a little small...sorry AJ.  I'll try yarn with a larger gauge next time.  urlLink    Three baby hats that went to three different babies.  Too cute!&nbsp; urlLink       Anyway, tonight is the first night that I'll be joining the knitting group at the Java Station in Santa Barbara, and I can't wait!  I only have one project on needles right now, and I like to take two or three, in case I get bored with one during the two hour meeting.  So, I guess I'll have to go through my stash and try something new.  Yay!  I hope to take pics tonight, so I'll try to get them up tomorrow.  Till then! ~Melissa

      This is a lot of posts on my very first day of my blog, but we received word today that Kent, my mom's husband, was in a motorcycle accident this afternoon in Oceanside.  Greg and I spent a lot of time worrying and waiting to hear what kind of tragedy the family was about to endure.  Luckily, and yet not, he broke his shoulder, but is going to be ok.  He's going to have to have surgery, but knowing what other atrocities COULD have happened, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief.  Greg has promised me never to ask if he can have a motorcycle.  I don't think I could handle it.  My only agenda now is to be there for Mom and Kent and pray for Kent's full recovery.  All my love sent down to everyone at the hospital right now...I wish I could be there.  :(   urlLink    Kent at Xmas with Harley Davidson book.&nbsp; urlLink     On a lighter note, I plan to put up tomorrow some pics of many of my completed knitting projects to date.  Till then!  ~Mel

      Being that I am starting this on the fly, and I'm supposed to be getting dressed on this fine Sunday afternoon, I imagine this post will be rather short.  This new blog is intended to be mostly about my life as a "knitting nerd."  This is not to say that all knitters are nerds, but that many people in my life could argue that knitting creeps into too many aspects of my life.  I am obsessed.  While I am hoping to primarily discuss my evolving talent as a knitter, I'm sure that school and teaching will also creep in here and there, as well as the many other aspects of my life.  I'll try to keep it interesting.  But that's life right?  There is no one aspect of life that can ever be the sole topic of discussion, and I always have something to say.  Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out this website.  Please bear with me as I try to figure out what I'm doing.  ~Melissa

      I loved that movie.  Didn't you?  Anyway...  This is the reason I got no homework OR knitting done yesterday.  Anyone would agree that she was more than worth it.  Yesterday was my friends' anniversary, so I got to babysit their three month-old little girl, Noel.  Isn't she gorgeous?  She received the stick-straight-up-like-you-don't-care hair from her Japanese dad.  It's one of her best features! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I talked and cooed and giggled at her and she sucked her thumb at me.  Her thumb is her favorite toy right now.  Too cute for words! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Doing things like this are my only relief for aching ovaries at the moment.  See, I'm dying to have a family like NOW, but, living in VERY expensive CA makes that a little difficult without some planning.  Greg and I just bought a house a year-and-a-half ago and are still struggling pretty mightily.  I have only worked off and on for the last two years during school and now feel that I need to use this crazy-expensive education for at least a couple of years before I have children.  Why?  Because I have every intention of staying home when we start our family.  There are a million reasons for this that I won't get into, but just trust me whenI say that kids are not an option for a couple more years and the aching ovaries are slowly killing me.  (OK, it's really not that dramatic, but it feels like that at times.)  Needless to say, I jumped at the chance of several hours of baby-head-sniffing.  Yes, I'm really that crazy.  So on to what else I did while babysitting.  I realized while I was there that there were a couple of FO's (Finished Objects) I had never had time to take pictures of in Noel's room.  I peeked around a little bit, found them and took a quick couple of pics.  (Sorry, El.  I really wasn't snooping, and I didn't think you'd mind.)  So here they are:  This little hat was a gift for Noel.  I saw the same thing at a VERY expensive boutique and thought, "I can make that!"  So I did.  I love that aspect of being able to knit! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      And here is the Big Bad Baby Blanket from Stitch N' Bitch.  This dang blanket took forever to make.  It didn't help that I made it from double-stranded cotton on small needles.  Ick.  Love the results, but I won't be making this again anytime soon. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     So now, I'm off to try to get some work done on the infamous research paper.  I have a lot of work to do in a short amount of time.  I can't believe it's due in a week!  Crap!  I am going to try to take a break at some point today to work out (I've worked out every weekday since Friday.  Yay, me!), and I'll probably take another one tomorrow to go to the Grand Opening of the new LYS in Ventura,  urlLink Anacapa Fine Yarns .  Anyone else want to go?  I'll be there bright and early to see if I can't get a "goodie bag."  Mmmm...Goodie bags!

      Good morning.  I have now been awake for a little over an hour, and I'm ready to go back to sleep.  Do you think this could be related to the I don't know how many glasses of wine I had at bookclub last night?  Probably.  We read  The Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love  by Jill Conner Browne.    SPQ Book of Love.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     No offense to anyone who loves this book, but I thought it was only ok.  It read like the snottier version of  The Ya-Ya Sisterhood , which I loved, and there was no story line.  The only thing that kept me reading was that there  were  a few giggles.  Next month we read  Anywhere But Here,  and  Life of Pi  is scheduled for September.  I'm looking forward to these two a little more.  Anyway, I, of course, started out taking a couple of pictures and then proceeded to forget that I even had a camera, so here are a few random shots I took last night and this morning.   Here is a sneaky shot of some of the girls around the bar last night.  There ended up being about 11 of us.  It's amazing how loud 11 women can get while discussing men.  A large apology extended to the neighbors.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      We all sat cozily around the fire in such a way that I really wish I had thought enough ahead to buy stuff for s'mores.  Yummm.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      As far as knitting goes, I began this scarf two night ago and am not quite sure I like the size of the striping.  (In case you can't tell, the top color is a warm chocolate brown.)  I thought I'd knit 12" stripes until I had a seven foot scarf, but now I'm thinking 6".  What do you think?   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Gratuitous flower shot just because I love them and they have filled the ENTIRE house with their scent.  :) &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I'm really excited about this afternoon because I get to babysit my pseudo-niece today! (She's my best friend's infant.  Mmmm...baby smell...)  Yay! So I probably won't get much knitting done today either.  But that's ok.  She's worth it.  :)

      I did it!  I did it!  The sun has broken through the storm, the choir is singing, and I am doing a very happy dance around my living room (much to the embarrassment of the kitties)!  My first attempt at a sweater is officially completed, and I'm still alive!  The sleeves fit!  Yay!  I stayed up past midnight last night and got up early this morning in order to sew in the newly-completed sleeves and finish the sweater with the button bands and neckline.  It looks great, if I do say so myself.  See?! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Here's a close-up of the collar.  I've never had to pick up this many stitches before, and I think I missed picking up a stitch somewhere, but I don't think you can tell.  Can you? &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Here's a close-up of the front.  I have yet to choose any buttons for this sweater, as I'm not sure who the sweater is for.  I don't know whether to go for something girly and pretty or a little more unisex.  We'll see... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Debbie Bliss' Garter Stitch Jacket.  All done! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I think that while I'm looking for buttons, I may stick to smaller projects for a while.  I have all that chenille to knit with plus a few scarves and hats I've been putting off.  Maybe a purse?  So much to knit, and Christmas is only 5 months away!  Arrgh!  :)  My knitting needles and I are going to remain best friends for a while!  And that's...a good thing.

Not much knitting was completed so far today, as I spent more time than I thought I was going to working in the garden and then worked out.&nbsp; Yay, me!&nbsp; I hope to get in a little knitting time tonight.&nbsp; I've bound off one of the Garter Stitch Jacket's sleeves, so I just need to bind of the other before I can start finishing it.&nbsp; Happy Day!

My order of Cotton Chenille from  urlLink NuMei  came!  It really got here super fast, and at such a price, you can bet I'll be ordering from them again!  Yummy new stash!  Deep Royal Purple, Wisteria, Amethyst, Dusty Rose, Lemon Yellow, and Neptune Cotton Chenille.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      While I can't wait to start knitting with all these beautiful colors, I think that Lucy might have been more excited even than I!  Lucy could barely handle the excitement of all the new stash.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Don't you wish you could experience pure bliss like this?   So...much...yarn...*sigh*&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     That's all for now.  Greg and I are up to Santa Barbara for the rest of this glorious Sunday.  Have a great day!

      Not a whole lot to talk about today.  I spent three and a half hours last night taking apart and resizing the sleeves to the Garter Stitch Jacket.  Greg said something brilliant last night that I had to hate him for for about 5 minutes.  No knitter wants to hear this when there has been a mistake made on two identical items. "Maybe you should have checked the first one before you knit the second one."  Grrr...I couldn't keep any grudges going though because I was using his hands to wind all the yarn I was yanking out.  This is not something that he was jumping to voluteer for, either.  Thanks for doing that, baby.    If I were following the pattern anymore, I'd only have about 1 1/4" to finish up on the sleeves, but they looked too short, so I think I'll make them at least another inch longer than the pattern says.  Here's what I have done on the sleeves for the Garter Stitch Jacket so far.  Maura helped me with trying to resize them to fit the armholes.  It basically meant leaving out the majority of increases.  Go figure.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Close up view of one of the notorious sleeves.  These better fit!  :( &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Hope everyone has a great weekend!  I'm off to study before class tomorrow. (Yuck!)  I'm only hoping that I'll be able to squeeze in some knitting around all the things that need doing this weekend.  Here's hoping!  :)

      Well, I didn't take any pictures at the Meetup last night 'cause there were only FOUR of us!  Where were you guys?  I think, though, that had I worked a little longer on the guy behind the counter, I could have added him to the group.  Maybe next month.  The good news is that I finished the Mystery Project and will soon be able to send it off and post pictures...That is, after I block it and actually go to the post office to mail it...  Anyway, before I went to the Meetup, I went to downtown Santa Barbara to a little place called the Natural Cafe for dinner.  Yummy!  It was so nice sitting outside that I did take a few pictures there and thought I might share them.  View from my table.  It was so quiet and relaxing that I thought I might not ever get up again...until the Drama Queen Squad landed at the table next to me.  Time to go.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Another picture of serenity.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     A canopied sky.  I spent a good deal of time looking up into the trees.  It was just so beautiful.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     My favorite thing at this restaurant is the Smiley Buddha at the front door.  I love him!  He's just so fat and happy!  Who wouldn't want to eat where Buddha is the host?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Onto this morning:   I realized when I got up this morning that I have a problem with one of my bettas.  These are two fish that I bought to be my class pets.  Since it's summer, they are home with me, but now I'm worried about ever taking them back into the classroom.  Meet Sonic(blue) and Jello Rainbow(red).  My last class of first graders named them, and I figure they'll retain their identities until they become new class fish to a new class.  I know it looks like they are together, but they're really not.  Theirs is a special tank with a divider in the middle to keep them separated.  That is assuming, however, that they don't JUMP OVER the divider and try to commit fishicide!!  JR is the dumbass who, I'm afraid, is depressed and suicidal.  I woke up this morning to find them floating around in fishy bliss ON THE SAME SIDE!!  Now, I don't know how long it is supoosed to be before they start attacking each other, but they didn't seem to be at it yet.  Thank God.  But why in the WORLD would a fish do that?  I just cleaned their tank yesterday, and I had to rip it all apart to get the net in there to dig out one of the fish and send him back to his own side of the ring!  Who knew fish could be this much work?  Fish are fun to look at, but you shouldn't HAVE to look at them to decide whether or not you need to intervene on their behalf.  Should you?  Very strange. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Anyway, on to my research paper for the day. (Yuck!)  Hope you all have a great day!

I am slowly but surely adding links to other cool sites and blogs.  (Just added a link to the Knitter's Review Webring, and there are so many cool blogs out there!)  If you know that I visit your blog, and I haven't added your button yet, don't worry.  I'm getting there.  I'm off to knitting Meetup tonight at Muddy Waters.  Yay!  If you're in the Santa Barbara area, join us!  :)  More tomorrow...

      I have a ton of pictures for you today.  I emptied the digital camera onto the computer, and I had taken 92 pictures!  In one weekend!  That's a lot for me, but don't worry, I won't unload them all on you.  I had another fabulous evening at the Java Station last night and managed to take some pictures before the sun went down.  I am missing three people, however, because two people had left by the time my camera emerged, and one picture was too dark.  I stayed until almost ten, which made for a late drive home, but I just didn't want to leave.  (Thanks Elaine, for hanging out.  I was so close to finishing that last petal!)  I came to the realization (with some help from the group) that if I want the Garter Stitch Jacket to look right, I'm going to have to take the sleeves apart.  *whine*  I'm going to suck it up and do it, but not right now.  I think I'll wait a little while and finish with the Cotton Chenille.  I want to send it out so I can put pictures of the mystery project up.  It's not that big of a deal, really.  I just don't want the recipient to know what it is yet.  Sorry.  I really like working with this chenille, though.  It's so smooth and soft to work with.  It's not stretchy at all, so I have to be careful when I cast on/off, but it's such a neat fiber.  I just ordered 6 more skeins from  urlLink NuMei , along with 2 skeins for Rachel.  My part is only going to cost $17!  After I spent $6.95/skein at me LYS, that's incredibly cheap.  Yay cheap yarn!  Anyway, on to the pics!  Me knitting at Java Station with the Cotton Chenille.  Really not the greatest picture, but there I am.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Some of the girls from the Java Station.  I remember almost everyone's names, but not enough to not look stupid, so they're just "The Girls."&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Three more.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Add two.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Plus Jess.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And Rachel.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    All together, with the 3 MIA, there were 14 ladies at the meeting last night!  It's not that big of a coffee house!  I guess it should not have come as too much of a surprise when the guy behind the counter asked to make sure we left a fire lane...just in case.  We were pretty crowded.  ;)  In other non-knitting events: Over the weekend, we went to Greg's company picnic.  It was really fun with great food and people.  The best part,though, was the air jumper-thingy with the GIANT Dora!  This ten-foot Dora was too good to pass up!  She's just so proud and smiley!  I've decided that I need one of these for my backyard!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     That same night we had Jessica over for dinner and, it was so nice outside, we decided to hang out outdoors all evening.  We ate dinner outside, watched the sunset, and hung out around the fire, watching the stars.  We even caught glimpses of two satellites making their rounds around the night sky.  Pretty cool for those who have never seen a satellite passing overhead.    Here are some pics from Saturday night.  Don't you just love to watch the sunset on the roof?  We sat on the roof of our house for probably about an hour.  What a view!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Man with fire GOOD!  Ugh!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Well, that's what I have for you today!  I have a lot to do with the rest of my day, so I'll check in again later.

      Holy CRAP!!!&nbsp; I know it is NOT brain surgery, but figuring out how to put the gosh darn KR button in my template has been one of the hardest things I 've had to figure out yet!&nbsp; Why do they not put instructions for this in the Blogger Help topics?&nbsp; Maybe it's more fun to leave us to our own demise and think of us banging our buttonless heads against the keyboard...argh! &nbsp;  OK- *breathing*  I am now, however, an official member of the Knitter's Review Webring.  Yay!  Now I can see and be seen with reckless abandon!  :D  (I'll comment if you do...tee-hee) &nbsp;  In other frustrating news, I have now figured out why it is important to recheck your gauge when you start the sleeves of a sweater.&nbsp; They're HUGE!&nbsp; Or I should say, where the sleeve tops are supposed to meet the armholes is huge.&nbsp; And I'm not sure what to do about this but take them apart and make them all over again.&nbsp; Double ugh.  &nbsp;  Here is a pic of what it would look like if I were to seam it now, but the armpits are off by about 1 and a 1/2 inches.&nbsp; Woops.&nbsp; I may have to go down a needle size or two, and try to get it right.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    &nbsp;  This IS my first attempt at a sweater, so I knew there would be hiccups, but I also want to get it right! So I'm thinking that, for now, I'll finish working with the second part of my Cotton Chenille project and work on finishing the neck and button bands on this dang Garter Stitch Jacket.  I have knitting group at the Java Station tonight, so maybe there will be someone who can help me from pulling my hair out.  I feel so lucky that I get to go to two knitting groups this week!  Stay tuned for updates on those.  Happy(*gritted-teeth*) Knitting!  :S

      I've been kind of busy today running errands, but I wanted to post some of the pics I took today.  I have about 4.5 inches of sleeve #1 finished on the Garter Stitch Jacket that I finished last night, but the little boy came over from across the street and started playing with the pegs in my row counter.  Now, I'm not quite sure what row I'm really on...Ugh.  I'll have to try to count the rows and hope that I'm able to count correctly.  I'd like to get the first sleeve finished tonight.  I bought the Fall edition of Interweave Knits today and am already foaming at the mouth at all the new patterns.  I want to make the Classic Slant Cardigan, Syncopated Ribs (with maybe a narrower and shorter waist), the Floral Felted Bag, Huntington Castle Pullover, Flower Basket Shawl, Silkroad Cardigan, Lace & Tuck Ensemble, 76-Stitches Hat...ok, ok, just about everything!  That's enough knitting for years in one magazine! Not to mention a budget breaker...    Anyway, here are some pics I took this morning.  I saw the sky when I first woke up and knew I had to go outside right away.  The garden is a mess, but by focusing in on just a few things, I found I still have a few gems that are just waiting to have the weeds removed.  I seriously need to spend some time in the garden...  Days are bound to be good when you wake up to a sky like this.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink   &nbsp;    Looking up the hill from the backyard...everything is so dry right now. The sky was too pretty though.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      I didn't know this was a Hydrangea for the longest time. Most of the year, it's just dark green leaves. I LOVE the color of the blooms!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I thought this flower looked like it was doing a happy dance with its shadow.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink       I love the coloring in this Bougainvillea and would love to make something with the same pinks and whites.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      Hope my pictures might have brightened someone's day.  Till next time!

      I'm sitting here with a righteous headache and my morning coffee, listening to a pissed-off Fiona Apple.  I'm not sure if the headache is due to yesterday's intellectual wasteland that is 16 year-old boys, or the close proximity to the evil that was a shoot-out with a sherriff in our neighborhood.  Maybe both.  Maybe neither, but it's all thrown me into a funk today.  Even Charlie and Lucy are fighting today. :(  So forgive any strangeness on my part today.  I did my duty and substituted yesterday for a 10th grade class and got my first taste of teaching high school.  I now know EXACTLY why I have no desire to teach high school.  I figured I'd go in with the attitude that the kids could do whatever they wanted, as long as they were doing their work and didn't mess with me.  Just remembering my own experiences from high school, the more strict a sub tried to be, the worse the kids treated her.  OK, so I let them know what my thoughts were, and most kids were fine with it.  There were a couple of girls who thought that meant they could put makeup on for three hours, but the most annoying were the two boys (and I'm using the term 'boys' for a reason) who thought that meant they could just take off.  One asked me if he could use the restroom, failed to take the hall pass, and then didn't return for almost 45 minutes!  Another took the hall pass and was gone for 25!  Then he came back, and I caught him on his cell phone five minutes later!  Aarrgh!  I had recourse, which was good, and I don't have to be there when it happens as the teacher is taking care of it, and I know it's not personal with the students, but COME ON!  If you had seen them, you could probably make your own judgements about these two anyway.  I'm just amazed at how things never change.  The same kids are in school that were there when I was in high school.  I'm not sure why I expected it to be any different, but looking in, you could tell which were the clique-y girls, the jocks, the too-cool-for-school kids, the geeks, the brains, etc.  They still dress the same ten years later with small adjustments, but I could have sat in that class as a student and felt exactly the dork I did in high school.  I don't think I fooled very many of them.  I bet most of them could have said the same about me.  I'm sure they knew that I would not put up that much of a fight if they wanted to make it difficult for me.  I am NOT changing my listing on the subbing listing to include high school.  I think I'll stick with my littler friends.  It is so true that there are people who were meant to teach small children(me) and others who would choose older children every time(not me).  The only thing I wanted to do after subbing was see my old first graders, so I stopped at the elementary school on the way home into the class where about half my old class is in summer school.  My heart was lifted as I received a Kindergarten Cop-style hug as I walked in the door.  :)  Hugs from eight seven-year olds at the same time are the best.  I miss them so much.    After lunch, I came home and passed out for an hour before class yesterday, and really didn't want to get up when I did, but I guess I'm glad I did, if only to hear that class has been canceled next week.  Hallelujah!  Knitwise, I finished the body of the Garter Stitch Jacket and am beginning the sleeves.  Here's the sleeveless sweater.  It doesn't need sleeves, does it?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I had a GREAT time at the Java Station on Monday night!  We had a smaller group with a few totally different people.  A couple of girls had JUST learned to knit and one was just starting her first project.  She was a little bit of comic relief as she tried to figure out how to slide her WAY too-tight stitches toward the points of her needle.  I think I helped her figure that one out.  I hope to see all you Java Station people at Muddy Waters next week.  Since I don't have class on Tues, maybe I'll even be able to make it to both groups next week...wouldn't that be divine?  Hmmm...  Well, I'll end with a couple of pictures I took of the knitty-cats this morning before they started fighting.  They can be so cute when they want to be...  Lucy, climbing the walls.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Charlie is obviously not impressed.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Have a great day!

      I love these things! And what quiz could possibly be more appropriate?!  Even if you aren't a knitter, it could still be fun!  :) I think mine is pretty accurate!  Pink Aluminum!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     You are pink aluminum. Retro, straightforward and fun, you love classic things. If they're 99 cents at Goodwill all the better! You are moved by striking colors and tasty morsels, and you like a stitch-n-bitch session in the sun.  Just remember, while you're being kitschy cool, don't get too cold. Ice cubes are best kept in your cocktails, baby!    urlLink   What kind of knitting needles are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Happy Knitting!  :P

      Well, it's Monday again.  I'm off to the Java Station Knitting group tonight and hoping to work on the sleeves of the Garter Stitch Jacket.  I thought I had both sides of the front finished last night, but upon inspection this morning, I realized that I forgot to reverse the decrease stitches on the right side.  I had to frog it, but I'm hoping it won't take too long to get back to where I was last night.  I'll take pics of it once I have both sides finished properly.  It's really coming along nicely.  I'll have to take extra care when seaming it after all the time and energy put into my first sweater.  I'm kind of bummed that I'll have to force myself to leave a little early tonight.  I volunteered to substitute for a high school History class tomorrow, and I'm FREAKED OUT!  I've only ever subbed in 1st grade!  These kids are going to eat me alive!  I'm doing it for a friend in my Master's class, so I can't back out...and Greg and I could use the $ for sure, but I don't know what I was thinking.  The class is a group of 10th grade boys who are retaking History in summer school.  I think there are about 35 kids in the class...I'm so SCREWED!!  (*Taking deep breaths and promising myself I am not going to act freaked tomorrow*)  Please wish me luck tomorrow...I'm going to need it.  :S  In blog news, you may have noticed the new tag-board in the sidebar.  How fun is that?  I thought it might be a cool alternative to trying to post a comment and having to navigate through several pages to get back to where you want to be.  Plus, no one is limited now to commenting only on my posts.  Not that you were before.  But still!  I'm amazed at what I'm learning about programming code and how to read them and where to place new codes and have them show up exactly where you want them on your page.  Why blogspot didn't make blogs compatible with drag-and-click is now apparent.  What fun would that be?  :P  Well, I'm off to shower up and spend some time out in the sun today.  The weather has finally started to act like summer!  Yay!

      Once again, I did not think I'd be posting again today, but I went to the beach this afternoon and came back with some pretty great pictures.  I went down to the water to see whether the Sea Lions I was hearing were visible, but I think the wind was carrying their bark over the water because I couldn't see them anywhere.  I found birds instead.  It was still a little cold and breezy, but it was SO beautiful!  Every time I go to the beach, I want to make myself go every day.  I think it's true that some people are attracted to water.  I'm definitely one of those people.  When we lived inland, it drove me crazy thinking that I had to pass over mountains to get to the ocean.  I hated that.  Now we live four miles from Ventura Beach, and Greg and I have been making a point of going to the beach for volleyball AT LEAST once a week.  Aaahh...(My apologies if you hate me now.)  :)  Anyway, here are some pics from our volleyball excursion today.  Enjoy!  Volleyball nets at East Beach.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Greg getting ready for the serve.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Looking away from the water at East Beach.  There isn't an ugly view anywhere.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      This looks exactly like the tangled mass of ribbon yarn that is still lurking in a plastic baggie in my knitting closet.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Somewhere, sometime, a little bird crossed my path.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Here they are!  They just did not want to come out of the water!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      This, folks, is why we live here.  I LOVE Santa Barbara!!  (sorry, Thuy...)&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      It's another gray and gloomy day, and I have naught to do but study and research (What effects does parent involvement have in the classroom? Exciting stuff, huh?), so I thought I'd post here first.  Seriously, for July, this weather is tired...Can someone PLEASE bring back the sun?!   Along with almost having finished one of the mysterious projects with the Crystal Palace Cotton Chenille, I've been working steadily on the Garter Stitch Jacket and finally have one front side and part of the back done.  I usually choose projects that will teach me something new, and this sweater is doing just that.  Below is the new decrease I learned.  I finally learned how to skp (slip one, knit one, pass over).  I love it!  It's really smooth and, even better, easy.  And it worked!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Here's the front of the cardigan.  It's finally starting to look like a sweater!  :)  Did I mention that this is a lot of garter stitch?  I can see why the original design was for stripes.  At least changing colors would have taken away from the millions of times I have to do the same stitch.  Oh well. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      A couple of days ago, I decided I could not spend one more day with my knitting closet looking the way it did.  There were piles of shopping bags from the LYS (local yarn shop), nothing was organized, and I couldn't find anything.  I found stuff I had forgotten I even had!  Yay me!  Particularly surprising were the 22 different-colored balls of Debbie Bliss Merino Aran! :O Yippee!  Thank you to BB's Knits for having some marked down 50% every time I came in.  :)  Anyway, everything has now been taken out of bags, organized, and put away, and I can now get to things at a moments notice.  Aaahhh...   I did not realize how much Debbie Bliss I had...Might there be a stripey sweater in its future?  :)  I think the colors will coordinate enough.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      The top layers of two tubs of stash.  Look Rachel, there's still room for more!  (Tee-hee!)   The third tub is just cheapy acrylic.  It didn't receive the high honors of a place in this photo.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Other things knit related is a website I found through  urlLink Amanda's blog.   It's a GREAT yarn site with INCREDIBLE pricing!  The site is  urlLink http://www.numei.com/ .  That darn Cotton Chenille was a THIRD of the price I paid!  Aarrgh!  Don't you just hate that?  I did need the yarn right away and don't know if I could have waited for it to be shipped, but still!  Anyway, I hope you all have a great weekend!  It looks like the sun is finally beginning to peek out, so I can still hope to hit the beach later.

      It's an hour before I have to head to class, and I'm screaming on the inside from not wanting to go.  I have had an amazing five day weekend with Greg, and I don't want it to end!  I'd much rather stay home and knit while Greg works on the computer and go to bed early.  Is that a CRIME?!  :(  Anyway, I just thought I'd post a few pictures from the 4th.  We had a great time with a fun group of people, mixed with a little alcohol(see pictures below).  We spent some time at Chris and Maile's(sp?), had a little barbeque, and a lot of Greg's GREAT margaritas.  We then proceeded to walk down to the beach from the Mesa to see the great SB fireworks display.    I have to say that the 4th of July is one of the few holidays that actually feels like it is supposed to.  Haven't you ever woken up on Xmas, as an adult and thought, "It just doesn't feel like Xmas(or Halloween, or any other children's holiday that you want to substitute here)?"  The 4th of July is never like that for me.  You're bound to eat watermelon, and some sort of grilled food, and it's near impossible to get away from some sort of fireworks display.  At least, that is how it is for me, and I love it.  Everybody loves America that day.  Whether that love is due to patriotism or alcoholism is not the point.  We're just fat, happy people on that day, and isn't that what America is all about?  (*crickets chirping*...failed joke)  I forgot that the 4th is over and that most people would be apt to chase me with pitchforks for that comment, so I'm going to stop there.  Just look at the fun we had instead.   urlLink    Greg and I with our champagne (shom-pon-ya), ready for the fireworks.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Sheri, Jessica, and me.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Kool and the Gang (Me, Greg, Dave, Sachi, Miles, Chris)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Manly Men!

      Just a quick update on trying to take apart the thrift store sweaters...No pictures yet, as I am way too frustrated with a certain tangled mass of ribbon yarn at the moment, and it has since been sent on a time-out in the closet. >:(    My attempts were not a complete failure, however.  My first try failed because I dropped the hank of yarn on the floor that came from the front of the sweater.  Once dropped, the yarn grabbed itself for dear life, and has not yet determined to let go.  The other pieces of the sweater were wound successfully around my tabletop and twisted into beautiful, tangle-free skeins.  :)  I figure I can at least get a tank out of what's left of the yarn, should I decide to donate the tangled yarn to the trash can.  We'll see...  I'll take pictures of my progress of other sweaters later, but I'm off to enjoy my holiday weekend for now.  Hope everyone has a great 4th!

      This week is probably the shortest amount of time in which I've purchased the MOST amount of yarn ever!  BUT it's also the first time I've bought that yarn in the form of thrift store sweaters!  Let me tell you how much fun it is to wander the musty aisles of the thrift store, looking for sweaters that are not 100% acrylic, imagining what other lives the fiber could be given, looking for good seams that will allow you to take apart the sweater in a few long pulls, and then realizing that it's Wednesday!  3-for-1 day!!  I could have died right there among the chenille and angora, I was so happy! :P  (Not really, but close.)  Anyway, I ended up with 7 sweaters with great fiber content for $8.00!!  Thousands of yards of pure wool, lambswool/angora blends, etc that would have cost me HUNDREDS in a yarn shop!!  Bargain Edna REIGNS SUPREME!!!  Sorry.  Got a little too excited.  Now, I just have to pull them apart following a little  urlLink tutorial  I found, and SHAZAAM!  New yarn!  Yay!  Also in knitting news, Ventura received a new yarn store called Anacapa Fine Yarns.  I went looking for it the other day, and it's really cute, clean, and the people were really nice.  There are a lot of classes being offered that I'm hoping to get in on once I find a job and we have a little more money.  I bought these two skeins of Crystal Palace Cotton Chenille there to make a birthday present that's coming way too fast.  I don't want to give away too much, but I'll post the finished products once the gift is given.  This yarn is so soft and cuddly, I'd love to make a baby afghan out of it.  Hmmm...  urlLink    These skeins of Crystal Palace Cotton Chenille look so pretty together.&nbsp; urlLink      Anyway, here are the sweater purchases I made yesterday that I plan to take apart.  Some of them are just garish(see pink obscenity below), and others are great, but too small.  They'll function better as hats, and gloves, etc.    urlLink    What's pink, and pink, and...pink all over?  This sweater!&nbsp; urlLink     This is definitely destined to be a VERY long, skinny scarf...maybe with fringe.  We'll have to see how well it pulls apart.     urlLink    70% Lambswool, 20% Angora, 10%Nylon.  Super soft!  AND only $1.95!&nbsp; urlLink     Thinking about the cream wrap cardigan from Debbie Bliss'  Easy Knits  for this one.  The yarn is just so yummy soft!     urlLink    Charcoal Heather sweater that's going to make a lot of cool beanies...and maybe gloves?&nbsp; urlLink     I have a sweater like this that fits from JCrew that I love!  This one would be too small for me but will make great other stuff.     urlLink    Really pretty polyester/cotton blend.  Really silky!&nbsp; urlLink     I haven't tried anything with ribbon yarn yet, but I thought a tank would or light shawl would be a great thing to try with this stuff.     urlLink    Bright red, new wool nightmare!  This is going to made a great, simple children's sweater, though.&nbsp; urlLink     This sweater isn't quite the tomato it looks in the picture, but I still wouldn't wear it.  It's big, bulky, too busy, and crazy red.  I'm gonna try for something a little smaller.  Well, that's all folks! (Ha-ha!)  The only other thing I wanted to put up is my little Lu, who is less sneaky than she thinks.  She's been loving my new purchases, and took the opportunity to make an attempt at my yarn closet while I was taking pictures.  It's a good thing for her that she's so cute!  :)  urlLink    A little Lucy who thinks she's getting away with a peek at my knitting closet.&nbsp; urlLink

      I had a great time last night at the Java Station and, while I didn't get that much knitting done, I was able to help teach another person to knit! :) I love it when new people decide to try the craft. It's so exciting to watch them "get it" and fun to remember all the frustrating first moments you had yourself. Poor thing didn't feel like she got much done as she had to take her work off the needles four or five times, but I think she got it by the end of the session and was excited about next week.   I worked on Zeeby's bag and have decided to give up on trying to find more of the claret yarn and will just make the straps in the same color as the body and use the claret for the gusset and stitch detail.  I don't know whether I'll bother with the inside pocket as I think I will probably opt to line the purse instead.  Still undecided.  We got to watch the Olympics while we were knitting, and I am just amazed at the synchronized divers. It seems like it would be extremely difficult to fall at the same exact time and speed as your partner. Once you jump off the plank, if you're not in synch, the whole thing is screwed. Dives that I thought were amazing were given pitiful scores! Just goes to show how much I know! LOL!  I promised pictures of the  urlLink Botanic Gardens , and I got Greg to show me where the pictures were hidden. We didn't take many flower pictures because there weren't very many flowers to take pictures of. Some of the ones I liked were dried out and not very photogenic. I think I've mentioned before that it hasn't rained here since February or early March, so everything is crazy-dry here. This is why we plan to go back soon. Supposedly, the sunflowers will be out soon, and that should really be a sight to see. So if you want to see some flower pics of the Gardens, there are a ton of other beautiful pics on their website, but here are some of the ones we took.   This is a view of the Meadow Area that is right by the entrance.  The view of the mountains was just stunning.  We may not have rain, but doesn't it look like a glorious day?  urlLink     urlLink      This is the Redwood Area.  It was so peaceful in here.  Hundreds of birds could be heard in the trees including some that sounded like monkeys!  I wish there had been water in the river because there are benches on the side of the trails that look out over the river.  It must be wonderful to sit in that shade and listen to the birds and the water.  It was truly inspiring.   urlLink     urlLink     This Field of Green was a ground cover that moved just like water.  I wanted to lie down in it and take a nap.    urlLink     urlLink      Here is Lizzie the Lizard.  Lizzie and her friends live in the thousands around the Gardens.  I must have almost stepped on about six of Lizzie's nearest and dearest.  They're almost impossible to see until you're right on top of them, but they were so cute!  urlLink     urlLink      I was not kidding when I said the riverbed was dry.  This thing looks like it is usually completely full from the website's pictures.  We walked right through the middle of it, however, without a drop to be seen.  It seemed that the only water in the place was that being pumped up the hill for display.  Did I mention it's dry?  :)    urlLink     urlLink      Luckily, Greg has really long arms so that we could get this self-portrait.   There were very few other people at the Gardens on Saturday, so we had to resort to the closeup you see here.  This was toward the end of our two-mile hike, and it had gotten really warm.  My long hair didn't stand a chance!  Up it went.  I need a haircut. urlLink     urlLink       Just as I'm finishing this post, there were two of the largest raccoons I've ever seen wandering across the backyard!  I mean, they were HUGE!  They were too fast to get the camera out, darn it!  Aren't raccoons nocturnal?  What are they doing out this time of day?  They can't be after the trash 'cause they were going the wrong way and they're the giant ones with heavy, automatically closing lids.  I've noticed that, since we made the kitties solely indoor, nature has come  swooping  back to the yard.  It's a safe haven for birds and now apparently other animals!  As long as the snakes stay away, I'm ok with it, but the first sight of rattle snake will probably make me want to move to Manhattan!  :-S   urlLink      Ugh!

      Well, it's back to reality today.  I'm back to focusing on the ever-elusive teaching job, getting myself on the sub lists, and trying to organize all my teaching supplies so that I can find what I need.  Honestly, I really need about two more large bookshelves to organize it the way I want, but it looks like a lot of it will have to go in boxes instead.  I have a lot of friends that are teachers who have been giving me things along the way, so that I almost have a full classrooms worth of stuff in my garage.  Trying to come up with a way of categorizing and storing it is a HUGE challenge, and I usually love this kind of thing.  As far as getting a job, there are almost no teaching jobs in the area.  Enrollment has been declining over the last several years in this area due to huge increases in housing costs and people leaving California altogether.  It's frustrating that I've put so much time, money, and effort into a career that I can't seem to get into.  I suppose I could probably find something if I were willing to work in the ghetto and worry about guns in schools and gang relations, but, as tempting as that is, I'm not that desperate yet. Friends that received their credentials a year ago are just now getting jobs, so I'm hoping that the hiring curve is on a one-year cycle, and that my turn is up and coming.  On the upside, Greg and I had the MOST fabulous weekend!  We started off Friday night with the Olympics and watched as the world's top athletes marched together.  Some of them just looked so excited and awestruck.  It made me want to be one of them, but then, who wouldn't want to be them at those moments.  It's the injuries and surgeries I'd like to skip.  It makes my skin crawl when the show the fresh scars or moments of injury.  Is there really a need to show a person's dislocated elbow?    urlLink     Friday's Sunset.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     On Saturday, we went to lunch at  urlLink Sushi Teri  (Mmmm...So yummy!), and then went to the  urlLink Santa Barbara Botanic Gardens .  Even without there being any water in the river/stream thing, it was SO beautiful.  There are about 7 different sections that include different plants native to California.  Greg and I both agreed that the redwood area was our favorite.  We just sat in there for a while and listened to the birds and other sounds around us.  So peaceful.  I'm not sure where Greg put the pictures on the computer, so I don't have any to post, but I'll try to put some up tomorrow.  We plan to go back soon to see how it all changes from season to season.  After that, we went to dinner with Greg's parents and Marc (G's brother) and Becki.  We had never eaten at the Macaroni Grill, and, while loud, it was great food and a great time.  Yesterday, we went to see the Village!  I have to say that hearing people's different reactions to this movie was a good thing.  I had lowered expectations after hearing that some people weren't sure what to think of it.  Instead of being disappointed, I LOVED it!  It was creepy and startling andCRAZY!  I won't say anymore, but if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  Tonight I'm off to the Java Station again to hang with more cool knitters and share my progress on Zeeby's Bag.  I finished the back panel and am about 7" into the front panel.  It's not exciting enough to take pictures of, but I will definitely photograph the finished product.  I'm hoping to have it finished and sewn together by the end of the week, but I ran out of the claret for the second strap and will have to find more or make both straps in the linen color instead.  Decisions, decisions.  I'm thinking that I may even line it to decrease any stretchy sagginess.  We'll see.  I'll leave you a couple pictures of Lucy's VERY tiring schedule over the weekend.  Apparently, she gets worn out from chasing pill bugs across the floor.  LOL!   Lucy on top of the washing machine and the clean towels.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Sleeping Beauty Strikes Again!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Well, not only is it Friday the 13th, but it's also Olympic Day!!! I look forward to this every four years, much more than the elections, and can't wait to sit my bottom down and watch every moment of the Opening Ceremonies! There's something about all our countries coming together just to play. The next two weeks are going to be the best two weeks of television until 2008!  Anyway, I got up at the ungodly hour of 6:15 this morning, for no apparent reason, and decided that today was the day I was finally going to attack the "office-of-no-return." Being in school, I've just thrown everything school- or work-related in the office and shut the door. Then, add to that the addition of an attic door, about 5 trips to the 99 cent store, and a husband who is making an attempt at his own business (still in the planning process). Let's just say that the place was a dusty dump that I've been avoiding for months.  While it still needs vacuuming, it is a THOUSAND times better and I can now get back into my yarn/stationary closet and feel free to use the computer. Aaaaahhhhh. So, while it was an uneventful Friday the 13th, I would not say anything particularly bad has happened. Plus, I get to work on Zeeby's Bag for Bertha tonight. And how can that be bad?  Hope everyone has a great weekend and enjoys the Olympics as much as I'm sure I will. Tomorrow is a trip to the Santa Barbara Botanic Gardens, so I'll be back with pictures then.

      Well, it seems that Blogger is not having a very good time with importing pictures today, so I got to play around with photobucket a little bit more. Pretty cool!  I started out on my Christmas list yesterday, and began wondering what I was going to do about posting pictures to my website. I'm finding out with greater frequency that there are friends and family that are current readers who are not letting me know of their presence. (*poke-poke*) You know who you are. However, I don't envision myself refraining from posting knitting pictures, so I had to come up with a plan. If you are a reader who thinks it's even slightly possible that you'll receive a knitting gift, made from the heart, by me, you do not have to stop reading. In fact, I would be sad if you did. I can't however start posting, "This is for {your name here}." That would take all the fun out of the surprise of Christmas morning and would give you the opportunity to let me know that what you really wanted was something else. Not gonna happen. Sorry.  So, I've made a command decision. When discussing what gifts will go to whom, you all will be renamed..........................................{drumroll}.................................... Are you ready?................   urlLink     urlLink    BERTHA & BUBBA!!!!!  urlLink

      I can barely contain the excitement of having not one, not two, no, not even three, but having, count with me now, FOUR WEEKS OFF! Now, granted, this means I have four weeks off from school. I have not been exempted from the real world that includes looking for a job, cleaning the house, or any other nastiness, but the idea of not having to study or write papers or read things that are not of my own choosing for a whole month...OMG!! I think I may have just died and gone to heaven.  I finished all of my work on time for my classes, turned in my last final last night, came home, and finished the blue and brown stripey scarf. It's almost 11 feet long! I'll have Greg take a picture of me in it tonight and try to post it tomorrow. So now, on my first day of break, I am taking the day off from everything but watching movies and knitting today. Ah, what a day this will be...  It will also be the first day that I will be starting in on this year's Xmas presents. (I know, I'm running way late.) I have many, many hand puppets and bags and scarves and maybe mittens(?) to make. I really don't even have all my projects planned yet. So I'll need to plan who is going to get what. Knitting books...here I come! (I'm such a nerd! )    urlLink      I even did one of my presentations last night all about my blog!  I think the guys in the class thought I was crazy!  Oh well.  Do I really care?  Not really.  Anyway, I'm off to get some major knitting done today.  Hope all of you can get to do at least a little of the same!    urlLink

      I did it.  I finished my crazy 28-page paper late Friday night, turned it in yesterday, and took my final.  One more night of class to go, and I'll be done with the quarter!  Yay!  Granted, Tuesday night's class requires that I finish a 5-page paper, another 2-page paper, a take-home final, and a 15 minute presentation.  None of which have been started.  Yippee.  I had myself a mini-celebration today by taking a long, very hot bath with my copy of Stitch 'N Bitch and beginning to make a list for the Xmas projects that I should have started by now.  It was so relaxing...Aaaahhhh.  Anyway, Greg thought he should take a picture of me in all my paper-writing glory.  He said I needed it for my blog, so here it is. Buying that laptop is one of the best purchases we've ever made. We have a wireless network to the main computer, and I drag that laptop everywhere. I just have to make sure I remember to step over the power cord. ;-)  urlLink     urlLink    I told you I spend my time in tank tops and pajama pants.  :)  For a while now, I've been meaning to put up pictures of recent FO's.  I decided to procrastinate a little today and take pictures of them.  I decided to go with the scary, headless version because a)I was taking the pics myself and that's the height of the speaker, and b)I'm taking a break from makeup this weekend.  (Scary!)  So here goes. This is my current WIP.  See all the tails hanging everywhere?  It's knitting up super fast with Trendsetter Yarn's Shake and size 11 needles.  I love the 4" stripes much better than the 12" I originally had and think it's going to look really cool when it's done.  This is definitely something I'll wear.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      As for FO's, here is a poncho that I finished a while back but never got around to taking a picture of.  I used double-stranded Lion Brand Wool-Ease with I have no idea what size needles.  I love it, but am considering altering the neckline because it is constantly falling off my shoulders.  Maybe I'll pick up the stitches around the neck and create a ribbed collar.  Any suggestions?  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      I could just be trendy and wear it like this instead.  Actually kind of cute but not very practical for staying warm on one side.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      I love this scarf made from Artful Yarn's Circus.  The oranges and blues look so cool together, don't you think?  It knit up in just a few hours!   Super fast!  If I could just get the ribbon sewn in, it'd be ready to wear, but I'm just not sure I'm confident enough about sewing yet, and I don't want to ruin it.  It's too pretty.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Here is one last picture of Greg and the kitties.  Lucy has a rubber-bouncy ball that she'll chase until she's panting like crazy.  It's hilarious.  She's very intent on the ball in Greg's hand right now, while Charlie looks on in contempt.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Well, that's all I have right now.  I hope everyone is having a great weekend and getting in lots of fun stuff.  I'm off to get some more work done.

      I really still am working on the paper-of-death.  I just had these 100 things about me waiting in the wings for a while.  There was absolutely no knitting done today, and Greg has the camera, so there will be no pics today.  Can't wait to get back to a normal life.  :)

       I'm finally in the last days of the black hole that is my research paper. The killer is that my @#$%!-ing computer keeps crashing! I've scanned it for viruses and...nothing. Aarrgh! I needed to get 5 pages done today, and with an hour left on this Wednesday, I've typed a total of 1 1/2 pages. Great. I need ANOTHER 5 pages tomorrow, so I'm looking at writing a total of 8 1/2 pages in one day. Double great.  While I was waiting for the virus scan to be completed, I snuck in some knitting and now have about 3ft. 8in. finished on the blue and brown-stripey scarf. It's looking really good, and I wish I could just spend my entire day tomorrow finishing it. So much for that idea.   urlLink      WARNING: Long confusing, meandering life questions to follow!  I just wanted to ask one final question. (OK- maybe more than one.) Have you ever been going about your daily life and suddenly had one of those moments of clarity where you realize that you have no idea how you became the age you are with the life you have? I woke up in the middle of the night and just had this I can't even begin to describe moment of panic. I'm married, and I'm living with this other person that I presume to know pretty well and presume knows me. We're gonna be together FOREVER!!! Yes, I still think that's awesome, and I adore him (I mean really adore, here.), but for that instant, it was daunting. "How did I get here?"  Not scary, just strange.  Greg and I talked about this and how well a person can ever really "know" you. One can only go on the information given. Do you ever really know if you got everything? Is it even possible to get everything? I imagine that no two people experience things in the same way, so even my telling him about my experiences doesn't make him feel what I feel. And this doesn't only extend to husbands, of course. No matter how well you think know a person, can you really say you understand what it is to BE them?  This is what too many hours of being secluded doing research is doing to my brain. It's not pretty, but it's me. The Research Paper of Doom gets turned in on Saturday and my final projects for my other class are due on Tuesday, so the light is looming there at the end of the tunnel. I can see it. I really can. I just have to break through a stone wall with my BRAIN to get to it!  Aaahhh. The idea of getting to bed before 1am looms ever so prettily. Can't wait till the end of this quarter.   urlLink

      First off, I'd like to thank all the people who have been commenting on my blog. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Who would have thought that anyone would want to read about my life. Maybe this was why I could never keep up on my personal journals...I already knew what was in it! I'm trying to get to everyone who has commented here to return the favor and am loving all the many different blogs that are out there. I also can't believe how many bloggers seem to know each other already. There is already this open-armed community just waiting for more members. So cool!  Anyway, Rachel and I did, in fact, head over to  urlLink Anacapa Fine Yarns'  Grand Opening and had a great time. We received our little goodie bags with point protectors and stitch markers, wandered the store and pet all the kitten-esque yarns, and proceeded to check out the classroom area in the back where they set up snacks, testing areas, and chairs for knitting. It was so fun! This picture is a view of about 1/4 of the classroom area of Anacapa Fine Yarns. I wanted to take pictures of a lot more, but, despite the fact that the staff was VERY nice, I didn't want to press my luck.   urlLink     urlLink      Anancapa was nice enough to put some of their great yarns out for a test run. These are the hands of one of the attendees who thought she'd give this really pretty ribbon yarn a try.  urlLink     urlLink     While there I reset the size of the stripes to 4" instead of 12" on the blue and brown scarf. I think I like it a lot better. If not, I'm not opposed to ripping it out again and change it to something else. We'll see. I'll take more pictures of it tomorrow.   Since I spent some time on Friday displaying one of my pseudo-nieces, I thought I'd put up some new pictures I received of my other pseudo-niece, Hannah, and her little brother, Elliot. Two new models for the fashions that were originally intended for their mother. (Poor Kristi will never get to wear that scarf! :) )  urlLink     urlLink      Here is Hannah, proudly declaring ownership of the scarf and hat set that I sent to her mom, Kristi. See the little purse I made for Hannah? :D She's SO cute!   urlLink     urlLink     Hope all of you are having a great weekend!  I'm off to watch  urlLink The 4400  with Greg! 8D  So intense!!!
