       As you probably read already, Mike Melvill piloted a craft 62.5 miles to the edge of the earth's atmosphere and called it, "almost a religious experience"...Well, if I had thousands and thousands of dollars laying around, I would get on that waiting list! But since I don't have that kinda money, I will settle for an experience much more realistic, transformation through Christ and Scripture! I was challenged by one of my friends with Romans 6&7 yesterday...He has been memorizing all 16 chapters of Romans...He shared those two chapters with me and they really hit home with my current struggles in this life..It talks about our flesh and how it is crucified with Christ in order that our body of sin might be done away with (Romans 6:6b) And through a story I read about Adam and Eve and their decision that changed the the world forever, I am forever changed...It talked about how in the beginning of Genesis all was well, no problems because their focus was on God and the constant stream of love, truth, and strength was because of their attention centered on Him. Until a serpent walked along ;) and started speaking to Eve. Here is the catch, she didn't just hear Satan, she had dialogue with him...Allowing Satan to distract her got her focus off of God and lead her astray...This is where the whole Romans 6&7 came in...Our mortal bodies, "earthsuits" are dead! We are no longer held captive or slaves to our flesh, we can no longer identify with it because we are new creations in Christ Jesus our Lord. Who was raised from the dead and death no longer has master over Him! So let me put this into more personal terms, my struggles that occur daily: lust, greed, covetousness, sexual impurity of the mind and body are real, but because I no longer identify with my flesh because I am in Christ, a new creation. I can only identify with Christ who has power over all the aforementioned...Another lesson learned from a woman!!!! Thank you Lord for women!!!! I just wish sometimes they would recognize that the way they present themselves can make a brother fall into sin!!

       Today was a government holiday but not for us good 'ol government contractors...I enjoyed today though, nice and quiet and I could get some work done, or so I wished...I just wanted to say hello to anyone out there following along (not sure if anyone is though) I will be posting some pictures from the Reagan processional down Constitution Ave. this past Wednesday very soon...I was lucky enough to get to participate in a very rare occasion here in the great city of Washington, DC...It was amazing to be walking over the Memorial Bridge at 6:00PM with absolutely no cars in sight! And to walk through the mall between the Lincoln Memorial, WWII, and Washington Monument with no body but a few ducks to enjoy the tranquility of it all!!

       Work has been busy today...Had a great time driving around printers and consumables for printers (NOT)...Came back to work and helped setup for a ceremony for one of the Colonels leaving for the War College in Carlisle...It is 4:30 and I haven't really done much, oh well...The verse of the day on http://www.biblegateway.com is Matthew 7:13,14...Only few will find the path? These words are so interesting, yesterday "keep reminding them of these things" and today, "only few will find the path"  What do they mean by few and how often is keep reminding them??? compared to todays' numbers (http://www.ibiblio.org/lunarbin/worldpop) a few would be what???? Some statistics put Christians in the world @ 2 billion, almost 30%...Is that a few??? It challenges me more and more to raise the bar and flee from evil desires and fleshly lusts which wage ware against the soul, 1 Peter 2:11...I was talking with one of my friends from the small group I attend and he said, "If somebody would have told me that becoming a Christian would make things harder. I wouldn't have!" As I read yesterday in 2 Timothy 2:19, we have a responsibility once we step into salvation to progress in our spiritual lives...Romans 12 also spells it out for us! I am encouraged to live this out, and I encourage you to live it with me! All the best my friends!

       2 Timothy 2:14-28 'A workman approved by God'  They spoke about these few verses in church on Sunday...They are a challenging few verses that make you think about how to better you relationship with the Lord and others around you...Paul seems to make it a point to say, "keep reminding them of these things" presupposes that the following topics he is going to discuss will apply daily to our lives as Christians...I wish that I could live out these things contained in these verses...It is so hard to love those who you know don't love you!!! I struggle with that at work daily...Then he says, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness"...WOW! That challenges me to flee from all things that come between me and the Lord!
