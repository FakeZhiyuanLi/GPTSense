      Slightly so.  Poured a 50cc bottle of Sprite down my throat and smoked three Marlboros to clear my head, and it seem to have worked at least to some extent. Rumors of another party tonight are floating about.  Last night, Weine started ranting about the meaning of the title of Chicago's track "25 or 6 to 4" so I suggested he used his Google skillz to find the answer. Two minutes or so later he found a post on a lyric site including the chemical composition of LSD: 25R624. It seems most of the groundbreaking artist in the history of music have all been using drugs of one sort or the other. Go figure.

      I'm getting awfully tired of dealing with my boss. Today, I finally made up my mind to get a really interesting argument regarding my working environment and motivational perks going, but of course he chose this particular day to be the single day this week he didn't feel like showing himself at work.  I seriously hope I still have as much anger and energy built up next time I meet him (which will probably be on monday). All possibilities considered, I'm preparing myself for a situation in which I will have to change the title of this blog to "Life through the eyes of a geeky former car mechanic."

      This evening two friends of mine helped me transport my Mitsubishi Eclipse to my place of work so I can start the work of replacing the head gasket. With a bit of luck and some motivation I will have the head removed by tomorrow evening, ready to be transported to the-guy-who-does-the-grinding. This gives me all weekend to work on a new exhaust system and some other stuff. Maybe clean the car up a bit? The hood needs a bit of scratching and painting, and I should probably replace the plastic stripes on the rear lights with some real paint. I should probably switch wheels, too, since the tires currently mounted are close to the definition of slicks.    All work and no play makes uid0 a dull boy, but if I put my mind to it I might have it ready for the road about the same time as my new driver's license arrives.

      Ok, everyone please send an e-mail to  urlLink webmaster@folksam.se  and complain about  urlLink http://www.folksam.se  only being fully available to users of Internet Explorer. Their "Internet office," where you can keep track of your insurances and savings in Folksam explicitly denies access to users of other web browsers than Internet Explorer.   Show them they can't support Microsoft's bullying of the competition. Make a difference. Prove to me I'm not the only one who cares.

      I can't get no sleep. In just over four hours all hell will be breaking loose: Loud music and two or three telephone alarms as well as a backup bedside clock should get me out of bed no matter how few hours of sleep I manage to get tonight. With this in mind I would very much like to go to sleep within not more than five minutes. A bunch of Chicago and a few Peter Cetera solo tracks in the playlist might help. So be it.

      I bought a used and slightly broken GSM telephone from a friend today - "slightly broken" meaning the inner display is hardly readable since she got upset over something her boyfriend said over the phone and tossed it, carefully aiming it at some solid rocks - and managed (due to a sudden lack of memory synapses) to screw up the PIN on my ComvIQ SIM card. This being a "pay before you call" type of service, I did not have the PUK to unlock it after mistyping the PIN three times.    After a couple of minutes considering the consequences of my actions and the possible solutions to my quite delicate problem, I decided to call ComvIQ customer services and get a simple "yes" or "no" regarding the possibility to receive the PUK from them. After "less than three minutes" waiting I was greeted by a friendly chap introducing himself as Henrik, to whom I explained my problem and asked if I was totally fried. His reply was (to my great relief) that he could give me the PUK over the phone if I simply answered a couple of questions to check my validity as owner of the card in question.    My slight hesitation and uncertainty regarding how much credit I had on the card and when I last deposited credit to it didn't seem to throw him off the slightest, but instead he read me the PUK as promised and I am very pleased to inform you all that it worked, so none of you girls need to change my number in your phone books.    A big, fat hug goes to Henrik at ComvIQ customer services for helping out so fast, and another (slightly bigger and fatter) hug to ComvIQ for having such great services and employees.

      I am finally beginning to feel satisfied with my X11 setup. This will of course change numerous times in the next few days until I manage to create an environment in which I feel comfortable, but at the moment I think it's rather cool.

      Today I made about â‚¬110 extra at work and left three hours early due to lack of broken cars. Two bills and a one day late birthday dinner with my brother (who turned 20 yesterday) later I was still on the financial upside of my situation as of getting up this morning.    I will hopefully get my dear Eclipse to work one way or the other tomorrow so I can spend tomorrow evening removing the head to replace the gasket. With a bit of luck it will be running smoothly before the end of the week so I can fully enjoy getting my driver's license back.

      I hate myself for it, but I have to admit it.    Once I get everything straightened out with the RSS feed and all the other stuff that seems cool I will probably start writing complete nonsense several times a day.

      What's next? Buying Microsoft products and driving a Volvo? Well, mainstream people seem to have more friends than I do, so why the hell not?    I'll get back to you on this matter.

      A friend of mine and myself went to check out the Uphill Racing show today. When arriving at the show we cruised into the parking lot and found a nice spot to park the car when suddenly one of the guys from the entrance came running up to the car, shouting to us that my friend should take the car inside and put it in the show. After about 15 minutes (!) of persistence we managed to persuade my friend to actually take the car to the football field where the show was held.  Lots of nice cars there, I tell you. Quite a bit of not-quite-so-nice cars, too.  My intent to get a nice body kit and some other goodies for the Eclipse grew stronger today. Hopefully, my motivation will last.  Oh, and I went to a gas station to buy a pair of sunglasses, and that cute girl I've seen working there a couple of times before was working. I asked her for advice on what pair of sunglasses to buy, decided on a pair and she gave me a nice discount. Nice girl.

      Ok, there are computer games that can make you a wee bit nervous while playing it. There are even computer games that can make you on edge. I'm telling you, though; running Doom 3 on a nice, big TV, accompanied by a complete surround sound audio setup in a small, dark room makes my heart pound and my stomach turn upside down.  I seriously hope Half-Life 2 will have surround sound support. I really, really do. Seriously.

      Been up for half an hour and I'm just about waking up now. Need to get dressed and go out for a smoke. Something to drink would be nice. Red Bull, perhaps? So be it.

      Got my driver's license back today!  Now all I have to do is get my car running properly and run it through authorities to make it street legal for another year.

      Last night I wrote a new presentation text for my user on Helgon.net, listing different reasons for me to think the readers of it suck ass. Today, I added one more reason and suddenly realised something must have burst in me on the way to work on friday. The behaviour and way of thinking my boss showed made me finally decide to tell him and his wife what I think about my job, how I want it to be and why I think they're treating me unfairly. I don't recall deciding to tell everyone else why I think they suck ass, but apparently that's a bit of a bonus. Maybe I will find the time and energy to translate the list of reasons from swedish to english in a few hours, providing insults to even more people.  Have a nice day, asshole!

      Arrived some time between 20 and 21, finding all the attending people gathered around a table on the front lawn. We played some games, drank some beverages of varying sorts and quality, smoked a lot of cigarettes and had a generally good time. At around 23 we decided to move the party inside, where we played more games, drank more beverages, smoked more cigarettes and kept having a good time. After a couple of more hours I started feeling it was time for me to go home, and since Magnus was about to leave I bummed a ride with him, dropping by Shell on the way to buy some food for tomorrow.  Now I'm at home, lonely and sad. If I would have had anything to say about my current situation, I could have been less sober or less lonely, but as usual I'm home relatively early, quite sober and all alone.  I need to get myself a life.
