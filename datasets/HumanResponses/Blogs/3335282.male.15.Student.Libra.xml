      Languages are really an amazing thing. They can differ so much, or so little, and they open up so much about the world and culture that speaks them. Languages are so much deeper than many people give them credit for, but they are an essential part of the human experience. If we didn't have language, we wouldn't be human.

      There are two days left until my school closes for the summer. I have two more days of pointless classes, as we've finished the year up already. A party in Deutsch I and I have to listen to speeches on controversial topics in World Studies, and I suppose I have to write a speech tonight so that I can give it tomorrow. I should get doing the research now, because it'll take awhile, but I have other, more pressing matters, like writing in my blog, vacuuming my room, changing my cat's litter, all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels, and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization, with shows like Clean Sweep, and stuff, and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do, and while she was saying that, I was desperately looking for my remote. It was ironic. I still need to find that remote.

      Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic.
