      I started to look for jobs in the newpapers for all kinds of position in the fashion industry from sewing operator in factory to a sales assistant in a retail shop. I don't mind to work from the bottom as I know I will learn more from there as I move up I will be more confidence. Just like how I work from scratch in McDonald's.  One day, I came across an ad in Straits Times recruiting for Apparel Assistant Merchandiser by WDA. That's how I got my 1st step in it.  I went through all the briefing conducted by WDA and also the 3 interviews. I was finally selected by Ocean Sky. I feel that I am very lucky to get this chance as they only select 3 candidates out of the 12 candidates that came for interview.  I remember that Janice was the one who interview me. Till now I am looking for a chance to thanks her for selecting me and I am still curious to know the reasons for selecting me:)

      My dream is to become a Fashion Designer all the while. Over the four years in McDonald's, I have seen myself grown in term of thinking, in term of maturity and I start to learn how to see far ahead of me.  One day I asked myself a question. What do I want to see myself in 5 years time from now? Then I realized that, I am very far away from my dream. The truth is I love the working environment and the people in McDonald's. The fact is, I want to work in fashion industry. And I don't even have a single knowledge about it. And I ask myself where should I start????????????  That's when I decided to give up my up-coming promotion in McDonald's as a 1st Assistant and to start of a new path to pursue my dream.  I entered into Lasalle-SIA to take up design course. After gone through one year in Lasalle, I told myself. This is not what I want. What has happened???   These one year in Lasalle, I am not happy. I was tied up with my projects. I did my very best to do every projects. I got good grades. But I realize that, slowly I lost touch with the outside world. As I have no time for my friends, no chance to meet new people out there. No time to know what is going on to the world. I feel that I have lost my communication skill with people in which it makes me lost confidence in myself. I became very bad-tempered eversince. This is not me!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will I want to continue this kind of life in the 2nd year and the 3rd year where projects' burden will be even heavier then this? Then what will my life be then? I told myself NO!NO!NO!  I make a change in my plan. I decide to work in a fashion industry to gain experience and at the same time to convert my study to part-time. As I feel that experience and networking in fashion industry is important. I need to build this up to gain my knowledge and confidence. And also to work and study at the same time I can immediately imput what I have learn.  I know it will be tough, but I still have to give it a try and go for it.  :}

      Hi.......Hi........Hello....... Welcome to the Inner World of Hazel........   Let me start this page with a little about me............. :)  I started out in the working industry at the age of 19 years old right after my 'O' level. I landed myself working as a Store Actitvites Representative at McDonald's Bedok Town Centre. This was my first job. I work hard and started climbling the ladder, step by step to the next higher position of Floor Manager to a 2nd Assistant Manager within the 3 years.   I was given a challenge and opportunity to open a new McDonald's outlet in KK Hospital with a new team. After which I was tranfered to McDonald's Kallang Stadium for a higher challenge as this store is a self-standing event store with Birthday parties, Store-Tours and Drive-Thru.  In the 4 years working in McDonalds,I have learned how to interact with different groups of people. Being friendly and having respect for others is also an important part of the job. It’s like the old saying, to earn respect is to give respect. We live just like a big family under one roof with love, care, concern and trust. Over these four years, McDonald's is just like my second home.  Working at McDonald’s has helped me to understand how a business works, how to control a store, know more about food costs, and how to deal with people. I have also learned how to deal with difficult situations when it comes to handling with customers.  Overall, the flexibility, association, teamwork, experience, management skills, and the potential for growth, that McDonald’s offers comes in handy for the me.   That's.........my............McDonald's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

      Today was my 1st day of lesson at WDA. There are altogether 10 people selected for this course and they are all from different companies - Bodynits, Ghim Li, Pacific Garment and Sing Lun. From Ocean Sky, Lee Ping, Joseph and me.  The common thing for all of us is that we all came from different aspect of industries and we are all new to the fashion industry.  Doreen Tan is one of the course lecturer. Today we were introduced to the fashion industry.   What I have learn today and how I feel about fashion industry is that...  Most people are drawn to this field because they expect it to be exciting and glamorous. It often is, but it is still a business. It's a high energy fast paced business that controls billions of dollars of consumer spending around the world......

      This week, we touch on Sample Room Operation and how is a garment constructed.  The sample room has almost every kinds of sewing machines in order to produce a whole garment. The best trained staff are employed in this section, considering the importance of a proper sample for the bulk production to be perfect.  To make a garment, the sequence of operations is as follows: -  Design  Pattern Making  Fabric Cutting  Pressing  Checking for quality  Dispatch  Each of these stages involves a different occupation like Pattern Cutter/Grader, Spreader/Cutter, Sewing Machinist, Clothing Pressers etc etc....  Overall, its a big process and every one must cooperate to make the things happen. Its like a chain of work from one department to the other. The results is incredible.  We got a lot of help and guidance are given to us. People like Merlin, Berni, Rose, and also people from other department. We really appreciate their help. Knowing that they are very very busy and yet they put in their best effort to  train us. It takes a lot time and patience. Sometime, even though they are so busy, they will still pop into the room to check if everything is fine for us. Its makes a difference, as it let us know that they are concern.  In terms of personal, they also gives us a lot of encouragement and concern. This really boast up our confidence and fear as we are really very new to this industry. And sometimes, seeing the people so busy, at times hearing people screaming from the other end really scare us.  I'm still getting use to working in office hours as I have been working shift work for the past 5 years. I'm surprise as I thought working in office line won't be so tire but it prove me wrong as after work I am very tire. There's one time I slept at 7pm till the next morning. But I'm still trying to adopt with the change :)  But the best thing is that,its make me eat my 3 meals regularly and I always have at least 8 hours of sleep everyday. And when I wake up in the morning, I will feel refresh with energy. I feel that now my life is more organize. Compare with last time, it a big difference as I always sleep and eat at inregularly times........

      This week, we had a factory tour. Ocean Sky was chosen as one of the visited destination. The three of us were excited about it as we are given a task to do for our class to give a short presentation of the company.  Its like a pride, we take pride for our company. We feel proud to show our fellow classmates to our company. We feel the most proud for Berni as she did the whole presentation and the tour. It wasn't easy as it was a big tour with questions poping up to her. THANKS BERNI, WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!!!!! THANKS YOU SO MUCH.....  In McDonald's, I conduct tours for school visits too. But its not as big and formal as to what Berni had did. I have learn something today again.  Wow its a non-stop learning everyday.  I am still working part time as a manager at McDonalds at every sunday morning. My boss still needs my help and also I like the people I'm working with. Its a bonding that have build over the years. I really love my crews and managers down there. We are like a family thus I decide to stay put and help every once a week.  My friends asked me why work so hard. You should really take a rest on sunday or go out and enjoy on sunday. I told them I did not work for $ but for friendships, love, care, for the people I work with down there. I also love my customers, its nice to serve them and its nice to see them come every week to visit Mcdonalds again and again. Some with kids, and they would call u aunty aunty good morning. Its a wonderful feeling I cant describe in words.....

      Hmmmmmmmmmm................ today I was sharing with Miss Tan, I am planning to take up part time course in Fashion Design at nafa. It was planned a mth ago and I was sharing with her my goals of life haaaaaaaa.  She adviced me not to take up first as she say that it will be very tough and tiring. As I will be on board onto the working team after the course and it takes a lot of time and commitment. And most of the time I will be require to work OT. I told her that I was aware of it. But I really like to give it a try. I told her that I can take the toughness, I dont might as its a dream.  Helen one of the lecturer said that as a fashion designer dont earn much. I'm aware too, I know its not easy epecially singapore market is small. But again I still want to take up the challenge.   HMMMMMMMMMMm............. I'm still bother by this and I guess I should approach Berni for advice........  Berni is very special. I have never see anyone so lively and so bubbly. She is a great motivation to me. She can just talk about anything. She has a very good communication skill in which I am learning from her. One of my weakness is communication, and it is important in this line to be able to speak and present well to other. I am still working hard on this area and I wont give up. Most of the times I would observe how people talk to one another and learn from their good points..... Sometimes I can be very frank and I know its bad as my friends will remind me that its not that good. :(  Well will try to improve................
