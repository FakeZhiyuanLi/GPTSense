       Hello, again. So today, being really boring, I took a shower for no reason at all. Like, when it wasn't needed. Eh, I guess I just needed to feel ...Errm...Clean?  Anyways, after summoning up all my courage, I decided to call about Diana and talk. Well, my palms were sweating, since this would probably be one of the few one-on-one (talking, not IMing) conversations that we would have. So after waiting for two rings, I heard a females voice...  "This number has been disconnected and cannot be reached. If you feel you have recieved this message in error, please hang up and try again."  Well, it was something like that. I was somewhat disappointed. And somewhat relieved, but more disappointed. I was looking forward to hearing her sweet voice. I'll try again tomorrow. But I guess that the message was not to be unexpected, since Diana is moving, and they might have either changed phone numbers, or are re-routing it to the new place.  I just spent my whole day pigging out on Fried Rice, playing computer games, surfing the web, and staring at a picture of me and Diana, taken after commencement. She looked absolutely breathtaking...Well...That's kind of an  understatement . She was... Enchantingly alluring and beautiful . Yep, I had to look at a thesaurus for those words.  Well, that's probably my day in a nutshell, nothing too interesting happened...Oh...I found out what a "d" means on a sports score sheet. It means "Draw" (yeah, I had to look up "tie" in the theasaurus to find it)! Well, I hope I can talk to Diana tomorrow; on the phone, or otherwise.

       Hey. Let's start off with a few things. Mother has signed me up for summer school (like extra tutoring, it doesn't count towards credit or anything). I'll be taking Geometry Classes twice a week, for two hours in the morning. Also, I MIGHT have some Advanced English class for two hours, once a week. She has also signed me up for swimming, 35mins a day, four times a week. Me, being self conscious, don't like to show my overweight body around people. Isn't there any other way? Also, she signed me up to a Level 4 class, which probably assumes that you're proficient at swimming already. I am somewhat proficient (I think...). Also, the girl I have the hots (and I mean I  REALLY  like her) for is not gonna be going to the same High School I am going to next year. So I'm a lonely teenager this summer. This is turning out to be a bad and lonesome summer for me. I'll be piled in work, swimming (although I don't object to it too much), and emotional problems....Damn...I'm soooo angsty. But I guess in the long run, swimming will help me lose those cottage cheese thighs and fat stomach. I wanna look good the next time I see her...:wink: And the tutoring will give me a headstart in a very difficult area of math.  Well, I guess, all in all, summer's gonna be pretty bearable...I still have a few friends who are there for me to confer with and stuff...But still...I miss  Diana ...I guess I'll call her tomorrow.
