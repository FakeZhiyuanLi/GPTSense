       urlLink MS search coder hacked into AltaVista   This made me laugh, just for the simple fact that if your were going to hack into a search engine to steal code maybe you should break into a decent one. This could all be crap but it is quite funny.  Microsoft a quick note:  inovation != Stealing others ideas  and yes i'm still pissed that Altavista went portal in the 90's!   BTW this bit of news is also mentioned on  urlLink Slashdot  I'm sure the guys over there are pleased to hear about this one :)

       Ho Hum   I should be working on the work website today, I've got to have a demo version running for Tuesday but I've got a nasty case of code block :(  Plus since I got that nice 21" screen at work I just don't want to work on anything else. I've also started to leave my main laptop (dell) at the office so I'm writing this on a spare compaq/fedora lappy.  Have to say say the dell is set up so well at the moment, I can code away and everything is set just the way I like it. Even though I don't use Dreamweaver visual stuff I still prefer it to the other IDE's I've seen. I've tried Zend and gPHP etc but I've used Dreamweaver since day dot so it's like switching from photoshop to gimp, it's just not going to happen!  I've also been working alot more in Fedora Core 2, I have to say it it a nice distro and I can see how people are saying that linux is ready for the desktop esp using FC2 for a while. I have to say though for some reason I prefer Debian to Fedora for no logical reason except i'm a debian fan boy :)  Hmm I considering going in the office and doing some work there but there is a copy of tony hawk pro skater 3 sitting on my desk that may attack me and force me to play it. Maybe it's safer to stay at home :)

      It was Kate Colmans leaving night last night, she works for a project I support called Community Links in Clydebank. It was in Bar Buddha in clydebank and like most work nights out I preceeded to get pished :)  It was a good lively group of folk, made better by my old friend Billy being there who I haven't seen in ages :) after a while I decied to go out into Glasgow to see what was happening, it's T in the Park weekend so I was expecting it to be quiet. Luckly my mate karen was out so we headed off to that old faithful the  urlLink catty .   The usually good time was had by all, I met this nice girl called Caroline, had more beer and danced away the night. So a good night was in progress till I found out the night bus that usally gets me home was cancelled and karen had disapeared!   So it was a nice walk home to the vale (10-15 miles, not sure but too long!) or see who I could find to crash at. Unfortuatly I couldn't get a hold of anyone but thanks to a cool adventuring night me and Opal had a while back I knew of a wee maintence cupboard in glasgow you can doss in.  Mind you waking up at 5.30am freezing and hungover in the city centre is not a cool thing, hence my cold and very sore head.

      Today I was mean't to be going to on of my projects to connect a couple of machines to their main exchange server in there main office. Configuring outlook of http is boring as hell and I had about 10 machines to do this to, so I though t I would call John who works for the Lennox Partnership to see if he wanted to come with and make a boring job a little less boring :)  I had to fix a problem on my managers computer (who btw has a nice office overlook the river and the carpark out the back) When I spot a rare thing - a space in the car park!  'John, quick park your car in that space in the back!'  John shot off to park his car (he was in a double yellow at the time) and I continued to sort the bosses computer. 10 mins pass no sign of john. Then he appears at the top of the stairs and asks to use the phone cause he thinks he's broken his ankle. I wish I had a picture cause the swelling was bigger than a baseball!  John up to the hospital, turns out he's snapped a bit of bone off that has ligaments attached and he may need to get an operation. He got a plaster put on his leg and was in good spirits. We went to the Chinise for lunch afters and i'm going to send him the Novell Technical preview stuff I got sent to help him pass the time!  Another exciting day at the SIP then!
