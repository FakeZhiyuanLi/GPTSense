						   Even thought this may seem like a story line...It's not! There is a deep thought involved... You will see it. Today, after "Garage Sale Shopping" with Alanna and her mom, Linda; her sisters; Alexis and Stephanie; and our friend Naomi...I came home to find a message on my answering machine. A girl, whom I went to school with in 1st and 2nd grade, found my number in the local phone book and called me. I found this intriguing, yet odd. For one, Why did she all of a sudden think of me, and decide to look me up. (At the time, I did not know that she lived in Valparaiso.) I decided to call her later, so that Alanna, Naomi, and I could go somewhere this afternoon. After returning from Alanna's house, I called her. Unbelievably she knew a lot about me. She spoke with one of my friends about my current lifestyle, my accomplishments, and where my life was headed. Now that the story part is over, I can go into thought with you. Why did she call ME? Out of all the people I went to school with.... What stood out about me in 1st and 2nd grade.... And that now she is interested in knowing me again. On the phone earlier... She asked me who my friends were.. (I told her John, Alanna, Rachel, Naomi, Ronnie, etc. Which she didn't know most of these people... But I had do explain some of my relationships to her...)... She asked me where I lived, what I drove... Etc. Again, this is all very odd. But, for the sake of acting in good faith... I decided to meet her @ Strongbow's for desert and refreshments. I will later log what happened at this meeting.

						   Yesterday I received one of the greatest honors of my life. I was presented with the Student Leader of the Year award; for exceptional leadership, service, and commitment to The Cause Youth Network. This is the highest award in our Youth Ministry. I was completely blown away by receiving this great honor. I was in no way expecting this award. I received a standing ovation by both services. I want to thank all who gave there input for nominating me for this award.   Even though it was one of the best days of my life, there is always a downfall. Yesterday I thought that I had wronged a friend and almost tore myself apart with worry. Then I find out from another person what really happened and I felt really bad. I also had friends that pulled me through it and I thank them for doing so.   Today my best friend,  urlLink John W.J. Staub  had a song from his album played on Shine 89.7. It was so awesome. After the first playing, I called in to the radio station to give a comment, but after I talked to the announcer, he let me share some of John's heart and his posting as the Worship Leader at the Cause.  Well, God bless all who read this and I will write again soon.

						   As I am soon to move into my 17th year of existence, I reflect on my accomplishments as a person. Sure, I was in Student Council since my 6th grade year, being President twice. I've been on the Cause Youth Network's Leadership Team. I am on the Worship Team at our church. I've won many awards. I've had many friends. I've met many Congressmen. I've been to many parties, dinners, and luncheons......But where does this get me in the eyes of God? Having things, knowing people, and doing "stuff" does not make me any better than anyone else. God loves me the same; just like everyone else on Earth. Materials and positions do not get me glory from God. It may feel good because the flesh likes it; because it is full or self-centered pride, but it is inadequate when it comes to Spiritual matters. So what should my focus be in life. If it's not just about being successful, what else is there. The answer lies in the word of God. Everyday I feel more desperate for God than the day before. God will show me something, or I will find a nugget in the Word, and I'll be satisfied for a time, but then the hunger comes back; and again I have to feed it. If this is what life is all about, they why are we all still locked up safe in our Lexus "Cages" and our huge expensive homes; believing that we have the highest social status of all people on earth? What in the World are we doing???
