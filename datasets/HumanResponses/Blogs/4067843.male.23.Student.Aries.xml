      As I welcome you to my new stomping grounds, I feel tonite is a great nite to introduce you to the content behind much of what this blog will speak.....    I am now, although at first skeptical, proud to say I have just finished watching a rousing speech from the next President of the United States, hopefully W. got a chance to see it but I know when I am on vacation the last thing I want to do is watch TV, or say read books, so hopefully Laura can read him the 9/11 report, although it is quite a deviation from his normal nightly reading of "My Pet Goat".     I do believe we got to see the most personal side of John Kerry than we have seen in any part of his campaign. I mean honestly I am still amazed at how many people still believe W. is a great leader, I mean I do understand that most of our country either doesn't care or is living their life-long dream of being a cowboy, through W.     I remember just 4 short years ago, after the fiasco that was the 2000 election was finished, sitting around joking with friends about moving to Canada to escape the madness.....well I never thought I would reach a time in my life where that possibility would actually favor my well being, but another 4 years of W. and who knows, anyone from our generation could be drafted and fighting in the next war theater. ....    With the DNC coming to an end tonight, what a ride....from Bill's speech who made every Democrat remember why we loved him, to seeing Howard Dean who started his campaign with no more than 700 known supporters rise through the ranks and address the delegation, to seeing Rev. AL give an amazing speech, and finally to John Kerry bringing it all to a close and showing the American public why he should be the next President of the United States. And of course I send my condonlences to the CNN executive who thought it would be a great idea to have an open mic in the control room of the convention, I mean of course the director is going to start dropping F-bombs if the balloons malfunction....and frankly what does so guy screaming "Go Balloons....Go Confetti....more Balloons..." add to your news coverage.....please people employ common sense and at least most likely in this case, it would had saved your job.....      welcome, salutation, and goodnite.....more to come later

      It’s been a few days but finally an update was in order, much like my room is in disorder....yes the summer of constant change is coming to a close as I finally get to settle down in a place for at least the next two years....  It was maybe the most annoying travel day I had ever experienced on Friday, what should had been a relatively simple trip from Washington, DC to Huntsville turned into a fiasco in the long term parking lot at BWI Airport.....If you have never been, the long term parking is located quite a bit away from the terminal so you have buses come and pick you up and transport you to the terminal......they advertise the shuttle bus comes every ten minutes, but what they don't tell you is that is stops at like 35 stops along the way, so we stood in the sun for waiting for an old, half broken down bus to pick us up....everything was fine and great until we get to the next stop and the doors won't open.....completely jammed.....something is wrong with this picture that a bus doors have no safety mechanism in place to make sure this doesn't occur...what if the bus would had been on fire....we would have all died....but gratefully we didn’t....we did get the opportunity to jump out of the emergency exit windows with all of our luggage....a bus full of people with giant suitcases jumping six feet out of a bus window.....gratefully we made it to our gate on time and made our flight......   We first flew to Cincinnati and then caught our connecting flight to Huntsville, where I had the opportunity to sit next to a truly unique man......at first sight he looked like a normal, rather fat man catching a flight home to be with his wife, in which you would assumed he loved very much.....this assumption was even more evident by his calls before our flight to call his wife and express his love and then his repeated text messages to her before we took off....wow finally someone who appreciates and respects the sanctity of marriage.....(unlike most repubs...)....well finally we take off and not five minutes into our flight this asshole is hitting on our flight attendant....and the best part she is buying it....now this fuckhead is up at the front of the plane with our flight attendant.....is this fucker really going to try to pick up a flight attendant not more than 10 minutes after his multitude of expressions of love for his wife....so he's back in his seat and is writing the flight attendant a note....oh wait a note on the back of his business card....he really grappled with this action...evident by his repeated attempts to wuss out and not cheat on his wife....but in the end he finds himself getting up to the flight attendant his expression of lust....so we are cleared for landing and we touch down in Huntsville and the first thing this fucker does is gets out his phone to call his wife....and once again express his undying love for her.....moral of the story.....this fat fuck cheating on his wife in the 30 minutes in between phone calls expressing his undying love for her.....and secondly,.....and most importantly he was a Bush supporter and Republican....haha.....well I don't know that but its the best we can assume.....                                                                                                   While I sit in AL, single, some fat fuck can't be happy that he found love with his wife; he gets greedy and wants to fuck the flight attendant.....

      One more full day of work this summer at the Climate Prediction Center....it was a great summer of course, busy but good. I got the opportunity for the last two days to be the CPC Monitoring Director for the NAME project...(North American Monsoon Experiment). It was quite nerve-raking but ultimately a good opportunity in which I learned a great deal. My job was to the prepare the 6-10 day forecast for the NAME region (pretty much Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico) and all fellow meteorologists would understand the annoyance of trying to forecast a phenomenem which isn't easy to forecast in the Day 2 period, but to try to get any semblence of skill in the 6 to 10 day period. I then had to address the Forecast Operations Office in Tucson, AZ in a daily conference call. Rumor has it I did a good job so we can chalk that one up as a win.  I have really taken the past week off from all of my projects, its easier to deal with the post-presentation burnout by just taking a step back from all the research. I will be traveling back to Huntsville on Friday evening (hopefully).....and my summer of perpetual motion will finally come to an end and I'll be able to truly settle down. There is something about moving 4 times in 2 months that drains the life out of you.....  And of course with only two weeks remaining until school starts, I have an enomorous amount of work to do in those 2 weeks.....say unpacking everything I own, getting set up in my office at school, pre-thesis talk with the advisor, buying a car (which is quite exciting) and all that entails, and just mentally getting ready to relearn fun things like dynamics and thermodynamics......  Don't become too comfortable with the lack of political banter, it will surely be back.....  The blog and the website may be on the move as I look into getting things hosted on my own server in the coming weeks....

      Yes....that's right in a little over a week I'll be headed back to northern AL, where I once again have to unpack everything I own, after moving twice in two months. I have enjoyed my time here although there are many things in this city which tend to rag on me....  1. it is impossible to eat a good meal here, you'd think with all these people there would be plenty of good places to eat, well of course there are if you prefer exotic food, like afghan resturants...  2. it is fun to have machine gun wielding police officiers pacing around the train you ride everyday.....  3. maybe something only meteorologists will understand, I am become completely annoyed with DC and lack of convection....the DC hole has been in effect all summer....  I do look forward to getting back to AL and starting grad school....  I did receive some good news today, although it was expected, just maybe not this soon, but a paper I am listed as a co-author on was officially published in the Journal of Climate....the link below will take you to the abstract and if you have access to the AMS journals, an opportunity to view it....   urlLink http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=1520-0442&amp;volume=017&issue=15&amp;page=2983   Of course I can have a post without a political rant and today once again it is squarely aimed at our W.  well....according to the Blue Hill Report, a publication here in DC, our favorite President is currently doped up on power anti-depressents....the following quote appears in the article  "Although GOP loyalists dismissed the reports an anti-Bush propaganda, the reports were later confirmed by prominent George Washington University psychiatrist Dr. Justin Frank in his book Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President. Dr. Frank diagnosed the President as a “paranoid meglomaniac” and “untreated alcoholic” whose “lifelong streak of sadism, ranging from childhood pranks (using firecrackers to explode frogs) to insulting journalists, gloating over state executions and pumping his hand gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad” showcase Bush’s instabilities."  ....well if that doesn't scare you i don't know what does....speaking from experience any one on this type of medication should not be the commander in chief.....NO MATTER WHAT....  a link to the story is provided below....   urlLink http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4921.shtml   Well obvisously it does make a lot of sense, our foreign policy has been compared to that of a mad man and now it seems to be fact.....our President is a paranoid meglomaniac......just great.....I know i should be going back to northern AL but maybe a change of plans including an escape to Canada could be in order.......   urlLink http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4921.shtml
