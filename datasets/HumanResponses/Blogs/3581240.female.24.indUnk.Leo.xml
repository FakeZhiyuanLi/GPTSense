      This morning I realized that the IT dept has finally cottoned on to what I actually do around the office and has barred me from accessing my own page!! Ironic that I can still access the page where I post updates, but can't read my own page! What ARE you people doing up there? Before, I couldn't access Chaser's blog (except during lunch hour) but now I can access hers but not mine? Hmmph, that's just mean!   The last few days has been miserable, it rained! I usually like rain, but not when it starts dangerously close to the quitting time of, oh, about a few hundred thousand people who work in KL!! See, KL-ites have been scarred by the "floods to end all floods" last year. Dark clouds makes them twitchy,  hujan renyai2  makes their butt jiggle in their chairs, full-blown storms makes them run around like headless chickens who suddenly can't drive. For the past 2 days, I've left the office at around 5.40pm and only reached home at about 7.10pm. 1.5 hours to reach home? It makes me batty, kesian my dad who's driving tho. We pass the time by criticizing idiot drivers (who pop up like  cendawan selepas hujan , pun intended) who drive around in pouring rain with no lights and cuts in front of you without signalling. It's absolutely fine with me if they kill themselves in the process, but just don't drag other ppl to the grave with you.  I'm one to talk though, I've caught myself doing one of many idiotic things while on the road. *hides face cos of shame*  Usually becos me was not concentrating or was busy trying to attach the **** Smartag onto the **** cermin! I've had some close shaves, not to mention a bizarre, slo-mo bang that completely destroyed the front bumper and dented some other innards of the engine. Remember Chase? Ehhh, probably not..   Yesterday night went to Taipan to pick up my new glasses, drove the Camry (hereby known as 'The Whale'). Now, I don't drive The Whale a lot. Probably less than 5 times since my dad bought it last August. Taipan after dark is a  nightmare , it's where all the restaurants, fast food places and tuition centres are. People even triple park, squeezing past these cars makes you say your prayers and wince in anticipation of the scraping sound as your car  bergesel  with another. Of course, first you have to wait your turn to experience this unique phenomenon. What are usually larger-than-most 2-lane roads (with slanted parking spaces on each side) gets reduced to about 80% of a lane.. Once you have successfully manouevered your way past the triple parked cars and also the train of cars waiting on the opposite side of the squeeze, you have completed the Subang version of a driving test..! No more wimpy parallel parking of a Kancil! Bonus points if you drive a wide or manual car, manual Kancils don't count ok? Those buggers can squeeze thru anything!

      Baru satu hari tak update dah jadi 'choas' (in the immortal words of Helic himself). I really spoiled you people la, too much of a good thing can be bad for me. Me tooks the day off semalam, cos needed to pick up a package that Poslaju couldn't deliver. There's 2 people at home during the day and still tak boleh dengar the Poslaju man honking away on Tuesday *tsk tsk*. I ain't making noise about having to take a day off (nope!) but I have to go to the mail depot personally to pick it up. Roped my brother to be my chauf.. er, chauffe.. er..driver (I give up!) so I don't have to circle the industrial area of SS13 looking for a parking spot. Ripped open the envelope and shook out my brand new Mastercard!!! Hehehe, my very first credit card! Well, excluding the supplementary I got from my dad since 1998 (which I use ONLY for Shell & Giant, dad!). And they gave me a nice credit limit too, enough for me to charge a plane ticket to Europe. So, technically I can hop on a plane tomorrow to Rome and go see cute Italian guys haha..  Had lofty goals for the day, wanted to cook a nice lunch and some choc chip cookies. Well, after making roast chicken, stirfrying some veggies and making a burger for my sis, I was in no shape to attempt cookie making so I abandoned that idea and watched Eurotrip instead. It's a classic clueless-American-teens-go-holiday-in-Europe kinda movie but it does have some funny moments. The scene at the nude beach and on the train with the horny Italian was hilarious! Now do you get why I wanna go to bella Roma? Word of caution though, there's lotsa bare breasts and bottoms in this movie, and nude men running around on the nude beach so the visual of the ensuing..erm..dangly bits bouncing around was disturbing, to say the least! I would've been more receptive had it been a group of hunks but wrinklies?!  *shivers*

      On Saturday nite, after a day at Sepang (have a nice sunburn now, look like an oven-baked lobster) I got comfy in front of living room TV (dad refuses to surrender the remote to the TV in the family hall upstairs cos that's the only tv with Astro and he wanted to watch EPL). Slathered in aloe vera gel, I sat and waited for the show..  I've been reading about Queer Eye For The Straight Guy for a while now.. The show has these 5 gay guys who are in charge of making over specific areas of a guy who needs a clue. Areas were interior decorating, food & wine, culture (this is kinda vague), fashion and grooming. First thing they did was pile out of a black SUV and proceeded to invade the poor guy's life and house. They criticized everything from his closet, the missing tiles in the kitchen, the toys everywhere, his unibrow and even ear hair (!!!). Fashion and grooming guy took their victim for a day of shopping and spa treats, even got the facialist to wax off the ear hair (!!!). The culture and ID guy basically took apart his house, painting, rearranging and throwing out anything they deem does not 'fit the look' of the house. They even went furniture shopping! Loved the look of the living room, painted the wall this light olive colour that looked great with white shelves. If I ever have my own place, that is what my living room would look like!  The cooking guy throws out stuff from fridge and goes shopping for a party their victim is throwing for his wife. He buys all these fancy crackers and foie gras (50 dollars for a tiny tin!) and proceeds to whip up refreshments for a cocktail party.  When they've done all they can for the victim (who actually looks quite presentable by now), they watch on monitors to see how the evening unfolds. Friends and family come over and exclaim over transformations (favourite quote: Mother of 'victim' says "Oh my god, you can actually see the floor!" when shown the walk-in closet with all clothes neatly arranged). Best part was when they started to nibble on the food!!! Nobody liked the foie gras!! Could see their faces change when they tasted it and the 'victim's wife even washes the thing down with her drink. Haha, the food guy was so pissed about that. He was whining about how much it cost and how they don't appreciate good food. Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's the best or that ppl would love it. I liked the show, definitely something different with a bit of drill sergeant and humour thrown in. Plus those guys are cute, esp the food and grooming guys.

      Yay, today's Friday!! Get to go home early and become a vege for the rest of the weekend.. Opps, I'm going to Sepang tomorrow to be bombarded by noise, fumes and general motorsports hijinks. Hope my day tomorrow goes great..  I've just realized something.. I'm totally moody with work, just like everything else in life.. On a normal day, work gets me down a little bit and my infamous malas-ness rears it's ugly head.. Like today, was mostly spent surfing even though I had something pending (but not important) and something else came in b4 lunch.. Oh, and also handling calls from enquiring marketing execs (getting sick of the quotation now) and an annoyed-sounding 3rd party service provider..  They were asking for clarification, and I was waiting for boss to come back from lunch.. When he got back, always on the phone and suddenly dah hilang.. Figured out he's probably in meeting cos all managers on my floor also MIA.. Decided not to wait for him, and returned the lady's call myself.. First did some investigative work (read: korek-korek dlm system) to have a look at the policy they were talking about and figured out the prob.. Then called her up and explained, tried to pujuk her a bit la by saying that I'll make sure it won't happen anymore.. If dia jumpa lagi kes like this, then can email me the details and will sort it out for her.. She said after this can terus refer to me.. Solved problem sendiri, so proud of me today,hehehe.. Must treat myself later!

      Kekeke, waaaahh.. Hari ni ada special request! My long-time fan and avid reader (raise the roof, Helic!) called me up and practically demanded me to update.. He sweetened the deal by throwing in a few compliments.. Damn, that's what I get for being a sucker for compliments.. Anyway, there's nothing much to tell so I'll attempt the unthinkable - the most boring blog entry in the world at this very second!! *cue that Olympic-sounding theme..*  This morning was waken up by the melodious polyphonic tones of my phone at the ungodly hour of 5.05am. Why 5.05? So I have time to sidai kain & grumble about having to get up before 6, hehehe.. Have to be in the bathroom by 6 or my morning routine gets thrown off track.. What's my daily routine like? *tinkling harp music + shimmering effects........*  6am > Turn on faucet, put toothpaste on toothbrush (strictly Colgate Whitening on Oral-B only) and brush my teeth..  6.05am > Cleanse my face (also inspect existing and incoming monthly pimples)..  6.08am > This one don't have to say la, if you don't know then your bladder and bowels must be distended like crazy already!  6.10am > Turn on shower and soap up!  6.15am > Get out of bathroom and kick my sister (who's still sleeping) out of room so I can get dressed.Don't worry, she's supposed to wake up at 6.10 so I'm doing her a favour.But judging by her murderous look and stomps otw to bathroom I'd have to say she disagrees!  6.20am > Have some quiet 'me' time (translation: lie on bed and stare into space)  6.30am > Scramble downstairs to cook meself an egg sandwich to bring to work, otherwise I'd have to go out in the hot sun to forage for lunch.  6.40am > Wait for Dad to finish getting ready. I swear, that man takes more time than me.  6.50am > Haul my generous bum into my dad's car to go to work, yawning all the way which prompts my dad to look at me with annoyance and ask "Don't you ever get enough sleep?" at which point I'll yawn again and he has to give up.  7.30am > Reach office. Dad practically kicks me out of the moving car as he's had enough of my constant reminders to brake and watch out for the other cars. Oh, and I keep changing the stations on his radio.  7.31am > Wander over to the stall kuih by the roadside and remember that I have my sandwich squished inside my handbag.  7.34am > Turn on PC and check mail. Usually from my boss or one of those company memos.  8.00am > Workday officially starts, but I take frequent breaks to read stuff and update this.  12.30pm > Lunch! Out comes my soggy egg sandwich while everyone eats rice with lauk. Smells of kari and sambal starts wafting among me and the other kakaks. Suddenly feel sorry I brought sandwich. Oh well, must finish.. Cannot waste. Chit-chat and look at somebody's massive wedding album.  1.30pm > Start work again. Damn, it's boring.. Alleviated by frequent Net surfing.  5.20pm > Call my Dad and pester him every 3 minutes, asking when he'll get here. After 3 calls, he doesn't even answer the phone anymore.  5.40pm > Dad picks me up, and I inflict more backseat-driver torture on him.  6.40-7pm > Reach home, go straight upstairs and shower. Love showers, don't you? Cannot imagine taking baths everyday, unless got someone in there with me! Hehehe..  7.20pm > Sniff out what's for dinner and help out if my mother spots me skulking around in the kitchen.  7.30pm > Eat dinner.  8.00pm > Finish dinner.  8.05pm > Instruct sis to wash dishes and kemas dapur. Get the washing machine going.  8.06pm > Iron/fold clothes while watching Astro. Notice previous iron burns inflicted on self as a result of ironing while watching Astro.. There's one on my right arm and another on my knee. Hmmm, maybe should stop doing this..  9.00pm > Go in room and burrow under trusty blankie with a magazine or a Foxtrot book (On Wednesdays I skip this step and stay up to watch CSI).  9.15pm > Go to my brother's room to borrow aircon remote to set timer (mine's broken). Complain about room smell - very icky..  9.30pm > Bedtime!!   *Disclaimer: I only sleep at 9.30 on workdays cos I have to get up at 5 am the next day. Need my 7 hours of sleep so I can function as an effective human being.

      I am sooo evil! Actually finished doing a simple flowchart for my boss.. Even did one for the proposed new process and highlighted the areas that I think can be automated.. But segan to admit that I'm sitting on it so that he doesn't bother me and I can write here..   Yesterday went lunch at **** with my colleague.. Was devouring my food (very lapar!) and updating each other about our respective status (he's a trainee too) when who should plop their bums at the next table but the gossipy duo of the 3rd floor!! Their superpowers include sniffing out newsworthy tidbits for office consumption and spreading them faster than the SARS and bird flu viruses.. My colleague groaned when he saw them "Siap la, balik ofis nanti mesti habis kena gosip".. He went on the offensive straightaway, jokingly warning me that 'Mami Jarum' dah sampai and told them not to start saying we were dating.. They did not seem pleased about that and fired back that there's no way I'd want to date him.. Ooooooh, burn!!! He was smarting and wanted to get out of there.. After that we cepat-cepat makan and went to *** to check out VCDs.. Oh, and btw later at the office one of the kakak asked me where I went for lunch with a smug look.. Damn, the gossipy duo talked!  How do you know when you've had a good lunch? It's when your lunch partner gets taken down a few pegs and you go back to the office swinging a plastic bag of VCDs, that's how!

      Remember the quotation I worked on last week, the one I presented in a meeting? They've been bugging me since yesterday, asking me to calculate it differently. Of course I can, but it's tedious to charge the customer that way. Also did another quotation and was asked to design a form sekali. This was for a company with 30 employees, that's why they let me do it. Don't think they'd let me loose to design a form for use by the general public hehehe..  Also got the job of figuring out how to automate a process that they're now doing manually. Probably because I'm the "IT grad", so they're going to sit me down with the IT dept and get me to argue/barter/persuade/beg them to program this process into the system.. Have to do a 'simple flow chart' and discuss with boss which areas can be automated..   Sunday was spent being misled by my mother and sister. First they lured me to KL for a nice lunch at Great Eastern Mall. Had chicken and a super-tasty mango ice blended that tasted like they pureed a whole mango and poured it into the glass with some whipped cream on top. Yum!! Then my mother said nak pegi rumah my nenek. Ok la, don't mind. Then I heard the word 'Seremban' pop out. What?! We're going to Seremban?! I can't, got mountains of work to do. But was dragged along anyway, hung out at my Mak Ngah's place until after 8. Did you know that they unleash idiot drivers on the highway after 8pm? The kinds that stay really close to the back of your car and weave in & out of heavy traffic, causing people to brake suddenly and cause heart attacks. As soon as we reached home and got inside, started raining grandma & grandpa cats & dogs. So damn lucky we got home when we did..

      Just finished a meeting (wah, my first meeting!!).. Hehe, so  takut  cos I had 2 managers and an exec listening to me. Very nervous and I sounded kinda squeaky, but thankfully I knew the exec and joked around with her. Very short meeting, about 30 mins and was to discuss about the rates I came up with. Cannot tell the name, otherwise free2 publicity aje.. Anyway, Boss gave the work yesterday so I had a day to figure it out.  I had a basic rating scale to work from, then it's just a matter of playing around with the numbers so that both my boss and the marketing people (who has to pitch these numbers) are happy. Looks good, although a little low in my opinion.. My phone is ringing!!!  Grrr, it was the marketing exec. Still asking for discount, then I realized I forgot to make a note that the prices are for a year. Hehehe, malu and so stupid of me! Now they want benefits that we can't cover and that means have to arrange for special acceptance. Was very nice of boss to mention that I came up with the quotations myself. Must be really trying to expose me and my work. Hmmm, either that or he's putting up his blame-shields for when this goes horribly wrong.. Nah, he's too nice to do that

      Okay, let's have a quick word. I actually had my blog hosted on another site, which was nice but I'm itchy and wanted to change the look. So I've migrated all my nonsense here and I'll re-post all my previous thoughts with the original dates.. Here's the first one >>   Hello all, big and small.. Hey, that actually rhymes! Okay, okay.. I can tell you're groaning at my obviously corny sense of humour. You're witnessing the birth of my little spot on the Web, where I will post my observations, rants and thoughts on pretty much anything that takes my fancy. There won't be any scheduled postings (I'm not that rajin!), only when I have something to talk about. Hope you enjoy the ride, and please put the seat down when you're done...!!

      My updating frequency of this blog has dropped off drastically, 10 days since my last blog?! Sheesh, baik takde blog camni. Probably the main reason is because I've been so exhausted and preoccupied at work, plus the fact that I can't come up with anything to say. So I'm gonna try and unload 10 days' worth of rants in one go.  My boss is starting to trust me more now. I did a rate quotation totally by myself for one of the corporate dept.'s customers, a bank. My boss basically forwarded me the marketing ppl's email and wrote there "Plse handle. TQ". Felt all empowered and independent woman-like haha.. That is, until I hit a wall and started scratching my head. A few calls back & forth solved the problem, although it took 2 weeks from the time the marketing ppl requested the rate to me actually emailing them my workcheet. In my defense, half of that was spent waiting for them to come back with more info from the bank. Showed and explained it to my boss, all he said was "Okay, very good.. Send it out now". Was so happy to not hear the words "I think we should change.." or "This shouldn't be...". Felt really relieved. It means something to me now to actually do something well and contribute. My boss is also pushing to confirm me from a trainee to an executive. Did the 360 deg appraisal thing, he actually pushed up some of my marks. He grinned at me and said "Can or not?".. Hahaha, what else was I supposed to do say "Of course!!"!  I'm doing better, health-wise. Went to the doc and sheepishly told him I keep losing my balance. Got my blood pressure and inner ear checked out, and they were declared to be in good working condition. Worried about what doc might find in my ear but remembered that I clean it every AM so  takpe  hehehe.. Doc said could be due to viral infection or stress. Gave me some medication and told me to come back for more tests if things don't improve. After almost a week, I do feel better but not because of the medication. He gave me these pills to "reduce the symptoms of vertigo and dizziness" as Yahoo! Health says (I looked it up). Wanna know how? By making you sleep your bum off!!! I took the day off on Thursday (22 Apr) and started on the pills Wed nite after dinner. Well, I couldn't even stay up long enough to watch CSI (which starts 9pm). The next day was worse, took the pill after b'fast & lunch and was barely aware of time passing by. Anytime I was awake was spent in a semi-conscious state. Felt lethargic and fuzzy-brained for the rest of evening.  My mum got her a new car, a fire-engine red Honda Jazz (aka Honda Fit in other countries) with red & black leather seats. Kinda a young-ish car, which explains why my mum came out and said "Rasa menyesal pulak beli, macam kereta budak-budak" while looking at it thru the window in the living room.(!!!!!!!!!!) I blurted out "What!!".. Gemok had a WTF?! look on his face and my dad just shook his head. She giggled and looked guilty.. *sigh* That's my mum, she said almost the same thing when my parents bought 'The Whale'. Took it to Taipan last Friday to get dinner, it's okay. Still need to get used to the steering and braking of it. Otw home, there was this Kancil tailgating us. Never mind the fact that the lane on the left was absolutely empty and up ahead was a traffic light, the idiot driver   absolutely positively have to   get ahead. So I moved left and a few seconds later he cut me off on the left lane cos the driver on the right lane wouldn't budge for him. When he stopped at the traffic light, I took the left turn and honked him at the same time. Felt malu, cos the Jazz sounded like a strangled duck quacking!!! I'm serious, it is the most non-menacing, pansy sounding horn I've ever heard. Arrgh, rosak!  It's a 4-day weekend, so plan to go out, shop a little and mengular kat rumah. I anticipate my dad looking disapprovingly at me lying on the sofa and asking if I even have a backbone since I've been slinking around the house all the time. I will be yawning and stretching as a form of response. Should write a fun booklet.. "How to exasperate your father in 5 moves or less".  Available now at all good bookstores and mamak newsstands for RM3.99. Why RM3.99? So I'd have enough money to buy a sundae + tax at McD!

      I have to, have to, have to, have to get The Sims 2!!!!!! Spent my weekend looking up any little tidbit I could find about the game, when I stumbled upon the mother of all websites -  urlLink Sims Zone . Look at the screenshots and drool! I mean, between this and Sims 2's official site I was thisclose to throwing a tantrum about having to wait till August before it comes out. Why so long?! *whine*   Work is getting to be quite a lot, but still manageable. Probably becos I take frequent breaks hehe.. I need to let my mind wander for a lil while before it can concentrate on the task at hand. I’m doing okay, a lil bit behind on a few things but otherwise okay. I don’t feel all that good today, feel a lil dizzy and lost my balance a couple of times. 1st was while getting ready to leave the house, bent over to put on my shoe and felt really dizzy and had to put a hand on the car to stop myself from keeling over. Another time was this morning at the office, I was in the ladies room and bent over. Didn’t even realize I’d lost my balance until I banged into the wall beside me and stuck my hand out to stop myself from sliding down towards the floor. Weird, it was like I blacked out for a second or two. I don’t want to go to the doctor just yet, cos I don’t wanna sound like a whiney idiot any more than usual. If I’m still keeling over in restrooms tomorrow then I’ll show my face at the doctor’s.

      Damn, I'm so glad the weekend is almost here. It's strange how I've had a lot of work to do but still noticed how slow time goes by. It's been tough, the weather has matched my mood. It's been dark, rainy and miserable.. Perfect..! Drove myself to n from work Monday and Tuesday, pity the roads were so clogged up that I couldn't  tunjuk skill  by driving menacingly. Although, I did honk and flashed my highbeams (get some help if you thot that sounded 'dirty') at this Chinese chick in a white Satria. But I swear it was justified! I had been queuing up for the Smarttag lane for 5 mins when she came out of nowhere, bypassed 500m of cars and slotted in front of me so suddenly that I was inches away from hitting that big ass-ed car.  My little sister's gonna be on TV this Saturday, at 8pm. Channel 16 on Astro. She won some contest to meet that Aussie Idol Guy Sebastian, she was practically giddy when I came home on Monday. My mum was mildly amused, as in "Apa yg best sgt pasal mat salleh tu..?!". That mood quickly evaporated though, when Monday turned to Tuesday. It became apparent that no one was available to  teman  her to the giddy, teenage shriekfest. Tuesday evening was spent sobbing into her pillow and begging anyone she could think of to take her. She was begging me to  ponteng  work Wed so can  teman  her, tapi mana boleh. She tried asking Gemok, but his only response was a grunt and "Oi, I have a life other than being your driver". And not in a nice way! I fired back at him "You mean you actually do something else other than eat and park your butt on the carpet watching TV in your smelly undies?!" My sister was still  melayan perasaan  when I drifted off to sleep,  kesian  and a little pathetic. I had no idea how pathetic until a lil while later when I sleepily told her to turn off the light and go to sleep. Just as I was about to drift off again, came the audible sobs in the darkness. Damn!   My dad twisted my brother's arm sometime in the night and got him to send and fetch my sis. He was furious, evident in his best ever imitation of a  tauhu sumbat . Sis got to go to Astro for shooting (hehehe.. I'm sorry, but it sounds hilarious just saying it) and came back with goodie bag and pics with the VJs. She actually looked pretty good after they put some makeup on her, but that was shoulder up. Have no idea what she'll look like full-length on TV. Teased her by asking if she took the pic after makeup. She said yeah, why? Hehehe, no wonder you look pretty! *dush* Got meself a kick on the shins. Owwie! She gave me one of the Astro tshirts she got. I'm assuming it's becos she borrowed my money to buy his original CD to be autographed and hopes that I will write it off. We'll see.. Don't forget to tune in to Astro Channel 16 on Saturday 10th April at 8.00pm.. Until next time! (roll credits and fade out....)

      I had ambitious plans for the day - wake up early, get all my chores outta the way, get ready and meet up with a friend for a day at the movies. Imagine a scene with happy, shiny background music playing that comes to a grinding halt as soon as I step off the elevator in front of TGV 1U. There, stretching as far as the eyes can see (well, my eyes anyway.. which ain't far cos I'm optically challenged) was the line to buy tickets. Holy crap, Batman!   What's a girl to do besides take her place at the end of a 10-shop line. I say 10-shop cos I've no idea how long the line was in terms of proper distance measurements. A few mins later, I was joined by my movie date and we stood in line courageously. Oh, there were times when we almost threw in the towel. Times when the benches at the side looked too tempting or when it seemed that we'd never reach the counter to say the magic words - "Two tickets pls".. But we persevered thru sheer determination and got our tickets after 1.5 hrs. Darn good seats too!  Why did it take us that long? See, the phone booking system is down so ppl who usually book tickets and leisurely saunter up to collect them (me!) were forced to actually queue up as Mother Nature intended. No more easy peasy tickets, now you actually have to work those tree trunks you call legs and earn them!! Fearing the worst, we braced ourselves for sold out shows or limited seats. Hang on a min, the screen says that 1.45 show isn't sold out. Tickets are actually in abundance! We got in for Day After Tomorrow and Shrek 2.  Had lunch, watched ' Lusa ' (I'm only quoting the movie's interpreter, so don't shoot me - altho we did get a good laugh at the very beginning hahaha). Verdict? It was okay, not great. Special effects were amazing, watch NYC get turned into an instant ocean and then an iceberg. How easy would it be then to climb on the Empire State Building, roar ferociously, thump your chest and pretend you're King Kong? That was definitely the star of the movie, and not the actors or the script (hokey hokey hokey!). Hands up those who thot Dennis Quaid can be their freebie! Wha..? Just me then? O-kay, moving along..  Can I also say that TGV giler semangat just now? In keeping with the 'dawn of a new ice age' theme of the movie, they turned the AC way up.. We had to defrost and walked around before hauling ass to catch Shrek 2.. Shrek was great, lotsa gags and jokes but it's a repeat viewing movie.. There's so many little things they threw in that you only register a few of em.. Must go again..  All in all, a great day.. Good food, great movies and even greater company.. Should repeat as much as possible.. Now if only I can find someone who can massage my achy knees.. Damn seats were too cramped! Hellooooo, anyone volunteering to be my massage guy?

      There’s a storm raging outside. I cannot see a single thing out there, it’s what those paint-maker ppl would call “Midnight Blue”. Why blue? Doesn’t the sky look black as ink at night? Specially at midnite? The fumes from their paints must have impaired them at the crucial moment of naming..   I’m getting off base here..  Still stuck in the office, and spent the afternoon doing statistical analysis (nonfancy name: staring at columns & rows of numbers).. I can hear the cars down on the road honking away even tho I’m at the opposite side of my building that overlooks the road so it’s must be a cracker of a jam! Did you read about the tree branch falling on the Monorail tracks right in front of Concorde Hotel & HRC? Happened at about 7pm yesterday (26/05).. The Monorail rammed into it and the branch dropped on a few cars that were stuck in the jam down below.. Thank god no one was hurt, I use that road every day and I was stuck in that jam just an hour before it happened.. We can have the best facilities in the world but God would still be able to put us in our place – just so we remember that there’s a higher being at work..

      Does anyone actually read this? Oh well, since this serves its purpose as my head-clearing spot I'll keep writing. Hmm, been close to a month since I last posted. Must train self to post more often! I was preoccupied, dealing with a family crisis. My mum was admitted for some strange illness that had 3 different docs scratching their heads. What started as a bad fever quickly progressed to 8 days in the hospital with some really nasty side-effects - the usual symptoms of fever and she developed what looked to be a really bad sunburn. Her skin was red everywhere, then it started to blister and peel. It was quite horrifying, I took a few days off work to  teman  her at the hospital.   The docs asked if she came into contact with any chemicals and pesticides..When they left, she quietly confessed to me that she did, in fact, kinda maybe sorta touched a chemical stuff. When I asked what it was, she looked like a guilty kid and said "Erm, mercury.." I  mengamuk  then and there, cos what I remembered from 2 years of Chem classes (not that I remember anything else) was that mercury was toxic and had to be handled in a certain way. Here she was telling me about how she rubbed the damn stuff all over her skin when she went to some  dukun . Apparently, one of my aunts (whom I already have a problem with) and my  nenek  persuaded her to go, saying he's a miracle worker etc.. My mum didn't have any serious problems, just felt fatigued and achy. Nothing a couple of vitamins and sleep can't fix. I don't believe in this sorta poo, and I told her so. Later when I was in the bathroom, heard her call my aunt and told her to come over and how pissed off I got.. When my aunt got there, all panicked and guilty, she claimed the dukun had been using the stuff for 19 years with no side effects.. Told her that unless he has a medical or science degree I do not trust him handling chemicals.. After a few days, doctors can't do anything else besides prescribe creams to lessen the pain..  My mum's home now, her whole skin is peeling off bit by bit.. Her face and her back are back to normal now, with new skin .. She's leaving bits of skin everywhere that has to be vacuumed daily.. It's like the Hansel & Gretel fairytale, instead of breadcrumbs it's a trail of skin bits.. Ewwww! Should be okay to work again by next week, and she's started yelling and nagging us again so we know she's definitely feeling better.. *sigh* Alhamdulillah..  P/S: To the fren who sms'ed and asked why I never update anymore - it's like the pot calling the kettle black! Hehehehehe, u also never update la wei..

      I want to be kissed. No, I NEED to be kissed. . I’m not talking about the usual kiss you plant on your gf/bf at the end of a date. Not a fleeting peck either but a full-on, forget-about-everything-else, hands-in-your-hair kinda kiss. The one that leaves you breathless and wanting more. You hang out, have a great time laughing and talking, and then before you know it you’re lost in a kiss. Okay, I know there’s no way you can do that here in Malaysia without getting slapped with a summons or having to go somewhere private and risking getting jumped by our moral guardians. But…. damn, I need one!  I’m what you can say a late bloomer, my first kiss was when I was 18. I’ve had my share of bad kisses since then. You know how some people just seem to have a lot of spit in their mouth and you can kinda see it when they talk? One of my ex’s had that problem and usually most of it would end up around my mouth when we kiss. You have not had a bad kiss until you’ve had to wipe the saliva away from the  inside  of your nostril..! Oh, and those Cosmo articles that say you can teach a guy how to kiss better by kissing them the way you want to be kissed? Did not work! So I split up with him after 4 months, because he was also insecure and the fact that he felt I was leading him to 'commit sins' ( buat dosa ). Erm, so now the girl who gets groped at every opportunity is the sinful one?  Another one of my ex burped right in the middle of a kiss. It was like getting a spritz of curry-flavoured breath freshener!  Tip : don't start smooching if you're gassy. And please God pull away if you feel something coming up the back of your throat!  I’m not asking for much here, I don’t need fancy locales or music. Just take me in your arms, start off slow and tender, building up to a heated finish. Or you can just pull me to you and snog the hell outta me. That works for me too… By the way I don’t need to tell you where your hands should go, right? hehehe

      Remember I had a meeting yesterday? Apparently when they said 3pm, they actually meant "Oh, anytime you're free after 3 please stroll leisurely to the meeting room.." I mean, my HOD was there waiting for everyone else and that just ain't right..! Made small talk while the rest of them started trickling in, we ended up starting 30 mins later. I guess this is how Malaysians view time - flexible to suit their needs. I mean, even the showtime printed on your movie ticket is a lie. 4pm is not when they start screening the movie, but one beer commercial after another (with a commercial for a feminine product slipped in somewhere to throw you off). By the time the movie proper starts, you've eaten half of your popcorn or Twisties or whatever else you usually munch on.   Aaaaanyway, I managed to get out of the meeting an hour after it starts simply becos I  volunteered  to present my department's project summary first. Then I excused myself, saying I have a deadline to meet tomorrow (aka today). Hehe, when I left the office at 5.30 they still hadn't returned from the meeting. I just think there's other stuff I can do rather than sit in there tapping my pen on my notepad for 2 hours.   Lookie what I got in the mail yesterday! A Victoria's Secret catalogue.. Ooooh, swimsuit sale some more! I think that's Gisele Bundchen on the cover, haven't looked inside yet.. Hey, do you think those VS girls' boobs are real? Or is it the indispensible tool known as masking tape and bra inserts that look like chicken breasts?

      It’s after lunch, one of my coworker’s phone is ‘singing’ Doraemon’s theme song in all its polyphonic glory. This is a woman who just gave birth to her 2nd daughter. The office is still quiet as not everyone’s back yet. It’s payday so I expect all the OKB to go far & wide for lunch and shopping. Look out the window, burp daintily and stare at the mountains of files and paperwork on my desk. I swear, it looks like I’m building a fortress of papers, files and ring binders. I’m supposed to attend a meeting on my boss’ behalf, have no clue what it’s about. But knowing the people who’re attending this meeting (managers and above), I have a feeling it’ll be long-winded. This should be fun. A drawn-out meeting with me not knowing anything. My jaw should get a good yawning workout, need to figure out how to do it covertly..

      Had a busy weekend, with a barbecue lined up on Saturday, a friend’s wedding reception on Sunday afternoon and a DVD marathon on Monday. Took Monday off to break-in my new DVD player. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s my first digital toy so I’m excited. Barbecue was held at my uncle’s place in Seremban. When I say my uncle’s place, I mean his sprawling agropark complete with a man-made waterfall and a small, rustic  gerai makan . The whole thing was organized by my mother and involved a few car-loads of our relatives. Food was great, all the seafood and satay disappeared into ppl’s tummies as soon as they were taken off the grill. Molte grazie to my screw-loose cousin  urlLink mysara . She smacked and grabbed my ass while putting the car keys in my pocket. Thanks babe, been so long since I got my ass grabbed! I mean, it’s not like anyone can miss it! It’s right there..!  Spent a scorching Sunday afternoon (with my hair and makeup wilting more by the minute) at my friend Liz’s reception. She got married more than 2 weeks ago, but since that was in Paka we had be satisfied with attending the reception of the groom’s side in Bangi. To those who don’t know how the Malay wedding goes, there’s 2 distinct ceremonies. One is the  akad nikah  – think of this as the steak. Without this, you are not husband and wife. Then there’s the  kenduri  (reception) and  bersanding  – call it the gravy and veggies that go with the steak. Not a must but it rounds everything out. Both sides of the family usually hold their own receptions. So it’s a lot easier than a Chinese wedding banquet where you kill yourselves trying to negotiate the number of tables the bride’s family gets. This way you can decide on the colour and theme of your reception (oh so important) as well as who and how many to invite. Liz’s husband’s reception colour was green – everything from the paint job of her in-law’s house, the clothes of everyone involved, decorations and the wedding favor (pandan cupcake, yum!). Thankfully, they chose a soft shade of green rather than the blinding, neon variety. Congratulations Liz, you looked beautiful.

      It’s a rare day as I’ve put some thought into my appearance for a change, rather than my usual ‘roll outta bed and grab anything in closet’ get-up. Tight pants? Check. Fitted red shirt with low neckline? Check. Bra with maximum uplift capability? Check. Earrings? Check. Make-up? Check. Nice,  manja  smile? All there. Find out I’m supposed to go to Shah Alam with my boss and help out some of our reps launch a new plan. Plan is specifically for employees of a government department. Hours of chatting up bored government ppl? *sigh* Realize it’s a bad day to go to a government office and be dressed the way I am, somewhat akin to waving a red flag in front of bull. Good news! Boss just told me I don’t have to go, must stay in office to hold down the fort. Excellent idea!

      Have you heard that (pizza chain) radio ad, pitching their new Exposed Sausage Pizza? The one where, instead of a normal yummy crust, you get a heart-unfriendly crust that barely covers a cheese-filled sausage? Blergh, I eat my share of fast food but.. I draw the line here..   Anyway, back to the ad.. Two guys are playing characters like a hero and a baddie villain.. Starts off with the hero managing to catch the baddie and ordering him to expose the secret weapon, “Expose the sausage now”.. then there’s like a zipping sound and the baddie is laughing nefariously.. The hero is then heard saying “Mmmm, nice”.. Hahaha, am I the only one who finds this a bit disturbing?!  I mean, kinda sounds like we barged in on a gay couple's role-playing game..! They might have intended it to sound like he was unzipping a bag, but I’m sorry.. Hehehe, you can’t use the word ‘sausage’ and then follow that up with a ZZRRIPP! sound! At least not with me! Yeah yeah, I know.. I got a dirty mind and I’m immature.. But life’s a lot more fun when you’ve got one!

      I'm crap at talking to ppl, let alone try to sell them something. Definitely wld crash & burn if I took up S&M (woit! Sales & marketing ok?! Not the other S&M.. Me prefer to get my jollies without pain, tyvm!). I don’t make a good 1st impression, been told that I seem alternately scary,  sombong  or  garang . What you call  garang  is what I call my defense mechanism. I’m really not all those things, it’s just that I feel awkward meeting new people. I clam up, get nervous etc..   I do not welcome surprises at all. Woe betide anyone who’s foolish enough to tell me they’ve got a surprise for me later. I’d bug, pester, annoy, whine at them. I know it robs ppl of their pleasure to surprise me but I can’t help it. My life is in order when I know the whats, whens, wheres, whos and hows. Screwed up? Yeah.. Anal retentive? Oh yeah! But that’s me. *shrug* I nit-pick and plan everything, or at least run them thru my head. My mind’s constantly working, going thru all possible instances and figuring it out. So when I get thrown for a loop, my mind crashes the previous painstakingly-set plan, re-boots and compiles a new plan. Basically, if you  kacau  my plans then I’m not a happy camper. Examples:  - Don’t come to my house without calling first. I might have been planning to eat my precious Pralines & Cream ice cream and not in the mood to share. Plus, it’s just rude to drop by unannounced unless got emergency..   - Don’t  ajak  me to go somewhere, and then say you’re “not exactly sure how to get there but we’ll muddle thru” 5 mins later in the car..  - Conversely, don’t say “Eh, tak sure la..” while looking back at the junction you just told me NOT to take and we are now, in fact, headed towards the East Coast..  To summarize, clear things with me first. And unless I sound extremely excited with your plans, know that you probably changed mine. But that’s ok, I’ll warm up to it soon enough if you’re a good friend. What if you’re not a good friend? Hmm, I'll have to think up a suitable punishment.. How's about a nite servicing my every whim and pleasure?

      Can someone light a fire under my ass please?! Not just any fire, but a great big bonfire. Hmm, that would result in a nicely toasted (or chargrilled) posterior. Was so lazy today, had a lot of work but kept putting it off til I realized there’s no way I can present it to my boss tomorrow if I didn’t get going right then. And so, like  lipas kudung  battling a bad case of after-lunch drowsiness, I set to work. Barely even looked away from the screen, only to be interrupted by a few calls on my phone ( mo-bile  if I want to sound British)..  My company is launching a telemarketing campaign for one of our products, so I was roped in to put the telemarketers thru their paces. I helped them out last time and apparently their manager thought I did a good enough job to be called upon again. What they’ll do is call you up, run thru their spiel and you get to pretend to be vague, nice or the ultimate bitchy customer. Hehehe, I love role-playing! Gimme a character, an outfit and I’m yours babe! But I digress..  There are some areas you’re supposed to observe, how well they talk, listen and know the product etc. I got to ‘road-test’ 3 TMs today. They really do work from a script, and I have a sneaking suspicion the script also tells them the tone to use at various points. All 3 of em talked the exact same way while they were going thru the script, going high-pitched at some point and emphasizing the same syllable or two..Freaky! I guess they really train those guys, although it’s a never-ending cycle since the turnover for these TMs are high. I remember considering the job during my jobless period last year. Bad idea. Why? TBC..

      I’m sick, I’ve got a major case of the sniffles going on. Damn flu decides to rear it’s ugly head after the fact that I had already applied for Mon and Tues off. I’ve managed to complete my work and am now awaiting my turn to upload it to The Powers That Be (our foreign office). I think that’s how I got sick, I got busy and run down that those pesky germs managed to invade and conquer my immune system. Some ppl thrive on stress, getting that jolt of adrenaline. Everytime I get stressed, I shut down and develop an illness. Flu, headaches, swollen glands, the inability to greet or converse with another human being etc. As someone who has lived with me before, I believe Chase could offer her vehement agreement on this. That’s how I cope.   My mum says I’m  lembik  (it means soft for any non-Malay speaking ppl out there, if there are any of you), that I fold at the first sign of stress. You would think I’d be adept at handling stress since I still live at home. Don’t get me wrong, I do love my mum. But she’s been tough on me growing up, actually she still is.. She’s taken to nagging me while we’re cooking in the kitchen, when she basically has a captive audience. By captive, I mean you’re trapped there since you can’t leave the  sambal ikan bilis  otherwise it’ll burn.   I plan to spend those 2 lovely days next week with the sofa, my blanket and 2 forests’ worth of tissues. Send someone to dig me out of those tissues if I don’t pop up next week, okay?

       I sent an&nbsp;e-card to my ex this morning, to wish him a happy birthday. And this is what I got in reply :     Thanks for the BD wishes. It feels great to be 24 years old...you put a typo in the greeting card...I will be 34 in ten years! As it is still the 28th here in California, but the 29th there...I wish you a Happy Birthday too!! Happy 24th!!! I hope you can still read this message and have the motor skills to operate a computer at your advanced age :)     &nbsp;  Damn that man! Haha, still refusing to accept that he's 34. But I  am  a year closer to my grave, I think they might have to start digging&nbsp;now cos of the sheer size of it.. I got birthday wishes from my family 1st thing in the morning. Why? Becos about 2 birthdays ago, I threw a major sulk when nobody acknowledged that it was my birthday. Sure, my friends remembered but my own family didn't say anything. No cake, no wishes, nothing.. That was a horrible birthday, sitting at the table with puffy eyes, red nose and eating a hastily bought cake. Ah, the crappy memories...

       Sorry friends, I’ve been busy. I have a deadline to make this Friday so have been working hard analyzing figures to be reported to our regional office. Trust me, it’s as boring as it sounds. My blog is kinda like the CBD, showing signs of life during the weekdays but deafeningly silent on weekends. I see some people are very diligent about updating theirs (I’m looking at you,   urlLink  Sarah K.    ) but I simply turn into lazybones when the weekend rolls around. I watch the idiot box, read and lie around the house so much that my dad already thinks he’s raised a well-fed snake instead of a full-grown daughter.   Last Sunday, I hauled my well-fed body out of the house and participated in that now-yearly tradition dubbed as the Malaysian Mega Sale. I have a strategy about these things, strike early and get out by the time the rest of the hordes get there. That’s why I was at   urlLink  Midvalley   &nbsp;by 10.45am, car nicely parked and joining the stream of other early birds. Malaysians loooove to go to malls on weekends, which means that the malls will get clogged up with people really quickly. You need big shoulders and nifty footwork to shoulder-check people outta the way while you’re squeezing between 2 families with their kids in those huge yellow buggies, trying to get from Shop A to Shop B. Only to run smack into the line for Pizza Hut. Yep, not a club or a restaurant serving hot, new Mediter-asian food (apparently this exists as I’ve heard the ad on the radio) but Pizza Hut..? Don’t you find it uncomfortable to eat under the beady eyes of people in line, willing you to hurry up and choke down that crust so they can get a seat? Yeesh.   I bought some new clothes, then whizzed to find a birthday present for my dad. His birthday is this Saturday, 2 days after mine. When I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, he originally requested “  urlLink  that new Nokia phone   ”. I indignantly informed him that it is way outta my budget and besides, he just got that new Samsung a few months ago. He chuckled and said “Fine, some shirts would be nice”. So that’s what I got him. Oh, and I bought a birthday present for myself too – a book and a nice new perfume. Always remember to treat yourself, especially when you’re feeling a bit down. It took me 20 minutes to get out of the mall afterwards, after seeing 2 cars battle it out for the parking space I was vacating and getting thru the jam outside the mall. They really should call it the  Malaysian Mega Madness .

       This conversation took place on Tuesday evening, somewhere in Subang Jaya. Two sisters (aged 23 and 15) had just finished watching Season 5 of Sex &amp; The City on DVD (available now at your local Speedy or Sg. Wang outlet)...     &nbsp;   Lil sis&nbsp;&nbsp;: Long, what's phone sex?    Big sis : Phone sex? Ada ah.. Apsal?    Lil sis&nbsp; : Cerita la kat aku.. How do they do it?    Big sis :&nbsp;Erm, one hand holds the phone while they talk dirty.. And the other hand (does vague motions in the lower extremities of body)    Lil sis&nbsp; : (utterly&nbsp;disgusted look) Ewwwwwww!    Big sis :&nbsp;If they use headsets, then both hands would be free f....    Lil sis&nbsp; : (interrupts) Ewwwwwwwwww! You're disgusting!    Big sis : What..?! I'm just answering your question..     &nbsp;   (silence as they both start eating dinner)     &nbsp;   Big sis :   Nak demo ke?    Lil sis&nbsp; : (looks horrified and runs away)    Big sis : Hehehehehehe     &nbsp;   And the elder sister was left alone in peace to enjoy her dinner...

       My recovery from Monday blues suffered a setback due to a wet morning. It’s harder to rouse yourself outta bed, take a freezing shower (my house doesn’t have a hot water heater, after the third one broke my dad refuses to buy a new one) and sit in traffic for 45 mins to get to work when it’s raining. Perfect weather for sleeping in and lazing around the house.  &nbsp;  Was trying to look like I’m working when this guy came up to my desk. Let’s call his Mr. J, who hands me my leave application, lingers around for a few seconds and then leaves. Here, when you apply for annual leave HR would return a copy of the form back to you. Thing is, Mr. J does not work in HR but as a clerical staff for another department. I have noticed that the last 4 or 5 of my forms was delivered by him. Weird.. because everyone else’s forms are handed back by the secretary or the HR exec. Why is he handling my form? Let’s flashback..  &nbsp;  When I first started here, Mr. J asked me to lunch. I thought he was being nice since I was the new girl. During the lunch, he kept talking about how he could tell I was ‘different’, that we could end up being good friends, and it shouldn’t matter what ppl say. Creepy.. cos how can you tell that about someone you chatted casually with. He had this intense gaze on me the whole time, like he’s earnestly trying to do some soul-searching. I don’t know about you, but staring at me is the fastest way to get me uneasy. Alarm bells started ringing off. Someone told me later that he’s married with 1 kid, but not before I gave him my number. He did call me, on my phone and&nbsp;during work to ‘chat and ask how I was doing, maybe have lunch again’. I don’t care who I have lunch with, but a lunch alone with a married man is simply not something I do.. anymore. Especially when the man in question is acting kinda shifty.  &nbsp;  He’s tried to strike up conversations since then, asking to borrow my thesis for his Master’s research. When I said it’s with someone else and not sure when I’ll get it back, he said it’s okay, he’ll just go to Uniten’s library and see if they have a copy of it. What the hell…?!! And he only talks to me when there’s no one around. Makes me uncomfortable. The kakak who sits next to me says “ Ala, dia cari alasan je nak jumpa kau ”. Horrors! What gets my goat is how he got hold of my leave forms, if he's really just helping to&nbsp;return it then shouldn't he have other ppl's forms too?

       I’ve been at this company for more than a year, survived the trainee phase and am now permanent in this department. I was surveying that bomb testing area otherwise known as ‘my desk’ (for the last 12 months) and here’s what I found on top of it:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Piles of documents (all neatly arranged, I promise)  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacks of files  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grooming products (box of tissues, moisturizer, hand cream etc)  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Decorative souvenirs on and around PC (tortoise, dolphin, pencils from holiday destinations, a tiny Eiffel&nbsp;Tower, a wedding souvenir in shape of half a bar of soap)  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 different calendars – flip type, card and bookmark shaped.  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;My water bottle and mug  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;My access card  &nbsp;  Let’s pop open my drawers shall we? Ahem, my  desk  drawers. In them are:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Handouts from every training I’ve attended.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;More grooming products (tissues, variety of lipsticks and glosses which I shun in favour of my strawberry&nbsp;flavoured lip balm)  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Office stationery  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Handful of mini chocs and sweets (for when I get ‘the munchies’)  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Box of crackers (when ‘the muchies’ morph into full blown starvation)  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 forks and a spoon  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;My cell phone’s handsfree kit (so that’s where it was!)  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;A monster calculator (like the kind they use at Apek’s kedai runcit)  9.&nbsp;&nbsp;2 organizers&nbsp;   Why am I going on about the contents of my desk? Cos it’s Monday AM and I can’t think of jack else to write! *chuckles* See ya!

      I hate my hair. Hate, loathe, abhor it. I don’t have enough of it on my head, and what little that can be found is usually thin. I usually trick people into thinking I have full, bouncy hair by blow drying. Like cookies or any baked goods, my hair is best when it’s fresh from the ‘oven’ – in this case, a hairdryer. That’s when it’s all big, bouncy and shampoo-commercial-perfect. I’d re-arrange, run my hand thru it and make alluring faces at the mirror until I get bored or realize that I actually look like I went 72 hours without sleep and am now constipated.   My look now is messy-chic – I’d leave the house with my hair looking as it did when I air-dried it the nite before. When you’ve got hair this thin, a brush does nothing for ya cos there’s no weight to keep it down. Means it goes flying in every direction. To re-sculpt it, you’d need at least 30 mins with various heated appliances and hair goo. I guess it’s all down to genes – my cousin  urlLink mysara  has hair all nice and thick. Curse you! I guess it’s from my mum’s side, since she has less hair than me and my arwah atuk was bald. But then I don’t have much luck with my paternal side either, cos my dad is fast on his way to becoming silver-haired. Hmm, I wonder how much wigs cost…    Edited : To tarik balik my pic

      Say you get to know someone who lives a long distance away from you, working or studying in a foreign country. You get to know each other, fall in love quickly and decide to get married. You get engaged when they’re home for a holiday, and make a promise to your fiancée to marry them within 2 years. Then they go back to their job/study and you start missing your new fiancée so much that you spend a small fortune to visit them for a week. Due to work/study and financial constraints, your fiancée’s calls drop to about once a week while you spend a quarter of your monthly salary to call them regularly. You send them their favourite local magazines and those cookies that they miss so much, remember your anniversary every month and pinching every sen to save up for your impending wedding.   Of course, along the way there are several misunderstandings. Like you were out the whole day without informing them or you talk about the wedding so much that they blow up and accuse you of pressuring them. Your fiancée talks about you moving there to join them while they work or finish their studies, but you know that you won’t be able to get a permanent job over there. They’re talking about all their future plans and expectations of you but would not commit to a decision that would allow the two of you to realize these plans. You start to feel taken for granted, lonely and depressed since for almost 1 year you’ve been having a relationship that exists solely thru the phone.   Gradually, your relationship starts to deteriorate. You talk once a week and can’t finish a single conversation without fighting or hurt feelings. They refuse to talk to your parents while constantly reminding you to call their parents and ‘chit-chat’. You feel ‘ urlLink tawar hati ' and everything you used to do for them, you don’t anymore. You don’t call every other day, a conversation now leaves you feeling drained and you catch yourself pausing and asking yourself if you really mean it while saying you love them.  And one day, after more than 18 months of waiting for them, your fiancée calls you up. Tells you that they want to postpone getting married by another year. Your chest feels like it’s a blender that’s whizzing up all your emotions into an unrecognizable blob. Then they mention the fact that they’ve decided not to come home at the end of this year becos it’s too expensive. You can’t help thinking the thousands you spent on those trips to visit them. You then realize that if you say yes to this hare-brained plan, you’d be marrying a person you haven’t seen for 2 and a half years! You wonder if this relationship is worth waiting for, where you talk 20 mins a week and you’ve only seen them for a total of 24 days in the 2 years you’ve known them. You wonder if you can even call it a relationship.   Would you wait for this person, endure another year of waiting and try to fix things so your marriage would have a chance of surviving? Or would you chuck everything and start over?

      You know them, you work with them for at least 8 hours out of the day. And they come with every imaginable  perangai  and quirks. You are forgiven if you thought these ppl came from  urlLink Charon  (yes, there  is  such a thing!). There’s almost 30 of us working on this floor, for a few different departments. Most of them are nice & normal ppl, I mean you wouldn’t feel the need to look for a 10-ft pole when they approach you. But you know I’ll only blog about the ones who have both feet planted firmly over the line of normality right?   Pitchy Lady – Now, she works just a few tables away from me. In her 40’s, this woman dresses the way my mother used to dress back in the late 80’s. Horrendous  baju kurung moden  with shoulder pads so huge that she can lend them to a NFL player. She’ll scurry into the office in the mornings, turn on her PC and check her mail while doing any one or all of the following: sigh loudly, repeatedly; exclaim “Aiyoyo” to the screen; spill coffee and biscuit crumbs all over her outfit or files and exclaiming “Aiyoyo” again at the mess. Throughout the day, she will make various other noises that I simply cannot describe and will start conversations with no one in particular. Let me explain. She’d be sitting at her desk, eyes on the screen and suddenly start talking. Everyone who’s within hearing distance of this (myself included) would usually look among ourselves to figure out who she’s talking to. Sometimes, it’s her colleague who sits in front of her. The rest of the time? It’s her own little solo conversation in that strange, high-pitched voice she has. Imagine a voice that’s cracking and constantly changing pitch, like a boy going thru puberty. Only it’s a woman. And she’s 40+.  Manager Burps – One of the managers on this floor has a habit of leaning back against his chair when he’s having a long phone call. I mean all the way back that he’s almost horizontal. From my desk, I can hear him gabbing away but can’t see him. There was once he finished his call and ambled over to my area to talk to his exec. Then we noticed his hair, which was standing up at the back of his head. The four of us started laughing like a bunch of crazed hyenas while he stood there wondering. He figured it out right then and smoothed it down. For an idea of how he looked like, see pic below.        Of course, he's no 30 yr old hot, blonde actress but you get the idea. I’ve also been unfortunate enough to catch his ‘symphony of burps’ and digging-for-buried-treasure performances. You won’t be yelling for an encore at the end of it, believe me!

      "...If he could only read her mind, she’d say…  Buy me a rose, call me from work Open a door for me, what would it hurt Show me you love me by the look in your eyes These are the little things I need the most in my life Now the days have grown to years of feelin’ all alone As she sits and wonders if all she’s doin’ is wrong..."

      I seem to write a lot of stuff after lunch. Maybe it has something to do with easing myself back into the workday, or they’ve closed off access to my favourite websites and now I got nothing fun to do. I was inventory-ing my dept.’s assets yesterday (it’s really not impressive cos there’s only me & my boss). You do stuff, and your mind starts to wander. Thinking about life, past loves, what to do for dinner later etc. I’ve realized that I haven’t had an actual, functional relationship in my 23 years of life. Oh, sure.. There were the casual boyfriends in school & uni, but my long-term relationships were unusual.   My ex was an American and Catholic guy, he was 10 years plus 1 day older than me. Why plus 1 day? Cos my birthday was the day after his, it was freaky when we found out. We spent 3 years of being on-and-off.. Off because we used to get into fights about the religion thing, then on again because we missed each other too much. It was a horrible cycle that we kept repeating, but for a long time I thought we’d end up together. I remember telling him that if he converted, I’d marry him the next day. It was that serious. Unfortunately, he said the same thing to me. So the only way was to get out. We broke up 2 years ago but he’s still my first love, and he got me thru 3 years of uni while I saw him thru changing jobs and buying his own house.   I read that you think about past loves or other people when you feel something is missing from your current relationship.. I guess that’s true, but if I were to write about my current relationship it would take up a whole blog altogether! So I won’t, because I can’t sort out the mangled mess in my head, at least not enough to make myself understood. But if I do succeed, you’ll be the first to know…

       Who? Why, me of course! In my mother’s fire-engine red   urlLink  Jazz    terrorizing the good folk of KL, Damansara and Subang. I usually hitch a ride with my dad to work, considering I don’t own a car and probably won’t until I get my study loan paid off. But my dad’s off sick since yesterday, so I’ve had to drive myself to work. He had, what the doctors call, a “stress/panic attack” Tuesday nite. Considering a similar episode landed him in the ICU for 2 days last year, his doctor ordered him to stay at home. I’m starting to worry about my old man (although he’s not really old, only 51).  Driving myself to and from work in KL yesterday was pretty uneventful. Erm, except for that close shave with that brown Proton but I swear there aren’t any damages! I shamefully admit that I turn into a complete monster sometimes when I drive. A singing, swearing monster who wants housewives driving at 50 km/h on the fast lane of a highway to “get off the frickin’ road”. I’m pretty good usually, it’s just that I can’t stand inconsiderate, oblivious drivers. Especially those that slow me down when I seriously need to go No. 1!

       I’m killing time until I can go home. Yep, I finish work at 5, leave around 5.30 and I don’t have any interest in staying beyond that. I don’t know, guess I don’t believe in putting in long hours just so you’d look like a model employee. Your work alone should be enough to show The Powers That Be just what you’re made of.  Now, I do understand that there are some bosses who expect you to ‘contribute more to the team’ or ‘show commitment to the job and company’. Always full of peppy, motivational buzzwords, these bosses slink in after 9 am while you’ve been at work for more than an hour. I know of one guy, after seeing his staff member leave work around 5.30 (her designated quitting time btw, though she consistently puts in the extra hours) 2 days in a row, asked her this.. “ Wah, so free meh? I don’t give u enough work izit?”.     I’m grateful that I got the opposite boss, someone who sends me emails about how counter-productive it is to do work after hours and if I happen to be at his desk when he realizes that it’s after 5, he’d be asking me “ Eh, dah pukul 5. You tak nak balik ke? Never mind, can continue tomorrow. ” Of course, leaving the office at 5.30 only means that I reach home around 6.45pm (yep, takes more than an hour to get home) but that’s another blog entry…

        I’m back, almost as good as new. I no longer have fluids leaking from my nasal cavity, but I’ve still got the splitting headache, the duck-ish voice and the body aches. Oh, and the doctor from my panel clinic set me up with a bunch of nice meds so I’m feeling pretty buzzed right now.     I was running out of things to do on Monday after making lunch, cleaning out the fridge and baking choc chips cookies. Holy crap, I was actually bored..!! Did not think it possible, I spend half my time at work dreaming of a day off spent sleeping at home. By Tuesday, I found myself watching a DVD and munching on cookies (if I hear one person muttering about how I shouldn’t eat cookies, I  will  come find you with a loaded shotgun..). Now I wish I was off again, maybe mysara was right – that we’re allergic to work. Wonder when they’re gonna come up with a vaccine for that…
