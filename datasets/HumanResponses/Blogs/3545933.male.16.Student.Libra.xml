       Now Playing:  Black Label Society - Mother Mary  Ah, the introduction of the age old "Now playing" statement, anyway, enjoy a taste of my music... tastes. Yeah.  So, anyway. an explanation is due on what the hell the title of this entry means. Well, after careful pondering i haven't actually released any information of importance about myself. This presents me with a moral dilemma. Do i delve further into my life and tell the public more about me, or should i be a reclusive wombat, whisping through the air and through the shadows, Appearing and making nonsical statements about plankton and dissapearing just as quick.  I actually don't know what to do, so i'll go with the tried and tested method of doing both. divulge a little information and drop back into the shadows. So... to get you going, i'm a typical english guy, year eleven, in a relationship (for how long i don't know) who loves music and movies.  but anyway, stuff. buttons and things.  tata.

      So, todays little escapade involved me trotting off to Rockingham Speedway to watch some racing and listen to some music, while avoiding the epitomy of Hip-hop disgrace, 50 Cent.  Mission Achieved. I got to Rockingham, and as soon as i get there, before i step inside the gate, i see the local metal band  urlLink Tortion  beating out a kick ass beat. The rest of the day was spent in a corporate box watching oval-racing, listening to some great rock in a skate park, jumping about with the band in a bouncy castle and stealing tires from the paddock. Good times.  But anyway, 50 Cent = avoided, his ASCAR crashed into a wall and Rockingham wasn't as crowded as it usually is. Bonus, Bonus, Bonus. But unfortunately, the Darkness's car managed to break aswell, back-end fell off, leaving one more musically orientated car in the running, the Liberty X car. We can see that quality is always adorned when picking these cars.   well, whatever. longer junk here later. tata.

      Well, somebody just took the time out to tell me exactly what tests i have next week, and i have to say my knowledge on a proportional amount of them is subpar. particularily with a subject as annoying as Science. Science is the BIG problem with my GCSE's. a long time i have spent toiling around memorising, or at least attempting to science facts. but hell, i can't even remember the topic titles. i seriously am going to fail, this GCSE, this double GCSE. its just going to be a catastrophe come Monday morning, i'm starting to think that i should actually not go to Rockingham tomorrow and stay home and revise, but i don't think its going to be much help. my main problem is i am a sucker for distraction. i mean, while writing this blog i'm watching some TV program that sucks, but i'm being utterly distracted by it, causing me to slow down and make this blog seem more slap-dash.  what i need, is a catalyst. i need something to spur me on, something to push me and keep me going. thats where the blogs name came from, i need a catalyst. i lack a catalyst, i do things for a reason, but i have it firmly etched in my head that i don't need to pass this GCSE, i can survive without it, thats what i truly feel. that and i'm lazy, so lazy that it pains me to actually do anything which i feel i won't get a reward from.   help.

      Day Two: So... since my last update... i slept, but not for too long. i sat in bed watching what is one of the penultimate signs of the apocalypse... Big Brother V. I never really watched Big Brother, but now as i seem to be becoming a victim of insomnia its essential watching. But i gotta admit, it is addictive viewing. I was watching till 3 'o' clock in the morning, and then some decent shows came on, by the time i started to fall to sleep it was light out. i should really attempt to get to sleep more frequently.  This weekend should be good though, a break from last week's 45+ hours at work and a warm-up for next weeks 8 tests. For a start i intend to sleep... yeah... sleep, but then a load of friends are coming over for a drink, which should be fun. But to add to the bucket loads of excitement already prepared for a piss-up... i'm going to Rockingham Speedway to watch some ASCAR and some local bands play. But alas. its not going to be perfect, as Rockingham speedway is also housing another performer, and his proverbial "crew". None other than 50 "i'm a hard man who gets shot alot, that makes me cool" Cent and his chums G-Unit and Westwood. Oh sure, a line up like that would have your average townie pop fan quaking in their boots at the meer mention of such an extravagant list of musicians, but not me. I don't even regard the aforementioned AS musicians. to me, they're a gimmick, relying on the fact that they're "bad boys" to sell records.   I know, i know, some of you are thinking "whats this guy on about, he hasn't listened to 50 cent etc." well i have, I've not only listened to the singles, but i took time out to listen to the albums. I'm not one to judge without actually listening. But i did, he sucks, all he does is talk in a monotonic voice as if he was selling brushes door to door, but its just plain crappy. He lies on the whole image that he's a hard man who plays by his own rules, who's had quite a few caps in his ass. all that tells me is that nobody likes him and he's shunned by his peers, to the point that they are willing to kill him to get rid of him. Of course, this isn't REALLY what hes about. Of course... theres more to him than that.  but i don't care.  Anyway, i'm going tomorrow. and i'm going to have a good time whether or not i like it. -angry face-

      Throughout recent years, the blog has emerged, i always felt that i never really needed to keep tabs on my daily exploits for the online public to meander through. But finally, after being seduced by friends and the whole Andy Kaufman situation i have started this blog.  I feel this is quite possibly the most awkward time in my life to decide to start a blog aswell, not only have i made a venture into the world of fulltime employment, but i'm about to embark on quite possibly one of the hardest weeks in my life. for next week is the beginning of a series of 8 tests. if i fail, i can't go into further education. you have to understand the pressure involved there. it doesn't help that i don't contribute to solving this problem by revising, and i spend my time writing blogs and messing about with web design, animation and sound editing. Surely i could be doing something more constructive with my time? Surely i could be working, pushing myself towards securing my educational future?  nah. can't be arsed.  To me, if i don't know the facts of by heart, then it never made the click to ensure that i would remember it. For instance, photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process that has something to do with plants. thats all i know, words like chlorophyll and the idea of oxygen doing something with leaves buzz around my mind, but mean nothing. i only ever remember things that i feel i NEED to know, or could gain some kind of advantage for knowing in the real world. for instance, in the case of English, this format of memory is a godsend, i remember it all from conjugation to enjambment, it just clicks, but science. bah. what use is knowing about the atomic structure of Nitrous Oxide when i want to advance in the field of computing?  But anyway. this is my blog, i'll try to keep it updated as much as possible, but with tests every other day, and long hours at work i don't think i'll ever get the opportunity to become a real "blogger" and ensure that every post is chockfilled with informative information on the day to day of the author of this blog. me.
