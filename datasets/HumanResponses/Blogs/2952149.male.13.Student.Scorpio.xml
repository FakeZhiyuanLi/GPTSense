      Whats wrong with me. The gift from Hell I guess. I just am no good with girls period. Like a mental block or something. The one good thing that happened today is I got tickets to the Yellowcard concert with Stacey. It's not that I expected her to agree with what I said in my blog but I am just frustrated and I know it isn't her fault and I am not mad at her but I wish she knew how I felt. I think I love her and I am not just saying that.

      The Yankees home opener was today! Since they are playing in Japan I had to wake up at 6:00 this morning and it was already the 6th inning lol. They lost 8-3 though....oh well. I guess Stacey didn't think my idea was so good because she didn't say anything and I know from experience that when they don't bring it up, it probably means no. Maby I am wrong though. Well, atleast I tried right? I don't think we will be going to the concert because there are only 100 tickets left.

      Today was cool. I actually look forward to school now. Just to see my friends though. Ok Stacey. Lemme tell you what I think. There's what.... a month and a half left of school right? So if we did go out and you ended up like hating my guts then you would never have to see me again. If it was a good thing then we would have a nice few months and we would keep in touch. Even though you leaving would suck atleast we tried it out right? Well I wish you would give me atleast a chance, eh? Think about it! Bye. Oh and my parents said the concert would be ok. Yay!

      It's finally the weekend! I slept late, watched T.V., and did nothing all day though I did play with my dog lol. I wish I could have hung out with like Chad or something but I never got around to calling anybody. Anthony is spending the night so that should be fun...I guess. I have known him since second grade but I seem to not be as friendly with him anymore. He is getting kind of immature I guess. Well I better go because he is here now.

      Hello. OMFG I am so pissed! In my guitar class our teacher is so dumn. She gave us this long ass project. We had to pick a guitarist (I picked Dimebag Darrel from Pantera.) and we have to right a two-page report about him. Plus we have to bring all this other crap. I thought we were supposed to learn GUITAR in GUITAR class! If I could, I would leave her class because I know the basics and I get private lessons at George's which is fun.  Atleast I got to leave school early but even then I missed the one class I happen to like. Mr. Moser. I had to go to the orthidontist to get my braces cranked. lol. He put on this blue wire and i'm not sure if I like it or not. Oh crap! I just realized I have math homework. What a great day. Oh and if y'all wonder why I type so proper and all, I don't know why, I just do.

      Bored. That is how I feel right now. I just finished dinner and am waiting for someone, anyone to get online. The lady at La Piaza is a dumbass. My mom ordered a pizza with half cheese and half pepperoni. The lady was like "We put cheese on ALL of our pizzas so you really want to say that you want just a pizza with half pepperoni." No shit. I mean really, what a ignoramus. That is probably the longest word I have said in a while. For all you slower folks out there, an ignoramus is an idiot.

      First day back. It was easy and we did no work all day. I was happy to see Tim and the rest of 'em. I was glad that I got an A on my Holocaust packet. That means I will get like 8 A's added to my grade. We had a new wheel teacher today. I'm not sure how to spell his name but I think it is Mr. Moser. He teaches Languages. We are gonna learn like 5 languages. Stacey had an...interesting evening but i'm not getting into that.

      I couldn't write in my blog yesterday because I spent the night at my friends house but it didn't matter, nothing happened the whole day anyway. I am happy because it turns out my grandma didnt have a stroke. They still aren't sure what happened but atleast it wasn't a stroke. Whenever I get online nobody is ever on. I cant even go read my own blog because AOL is too gay. When I try to read it the parental control thing blocks it. If my dad types in his password it will let me go but then I think he is able to go to it also and I dont want him reading it because it is none of his business. lol. Tomorrow is the day we go back to school which I guess is good because I get to see my friends again. Plus, I miss Stacey (HINT HINT). Nothing really else to talk about but I may post later or tomorrow.

      I am happy to be back home. Visiting my grandparents was ok, I would just rather be home with my friends. Hey Stacey guess what. I had waffles for breakfast yesterday. I even got a little freaky and added some syrup! lol. Over the week we just went shopping and drove around to different places. Like 40 minutes after we got home my grandpa called and said my grandma was in the emergency room and he thinks she may have had a stroke! Can you believe that shit!

      Today was a pretty busy day. First my mom and I went to drop my dog off at the kennel because I am going to visit my grandparents for a few days. Then we went out to the Kmart in Dr. Phillips so we could pick up some of my mom's stuff. Lastly we went over to George's Music so I could get more guitar picks. When I got home I just did nothing and here I am now. I gotta go to dinner now but I'll try to get on later.

      First day of spring break! I did everything I planned to do....nothing. I really have nothing to talk about. Oh yeah, tomorrow is my dads birthday. I'm sad because I won't see Stacey for like a whole week! Right now I'm listening to Pantera (HELL YEAH!). I am still mad because they broke up but Dimebag and some of the other guys started a new band called Damageplan so maybe I'll check e'm out. That's all.

      Today was fun! Since it was the last day before spring break, we did almost no work. In math I actually had a good time. We played this game but all I really did was talk to Stacey, Thomas, and Mark. I am glad to see Stacey is feeling a bit better, I felt bad to see her so down. (Maybe I will still have a chance before the year is over!)lol....or not. Yesterday was a bad but fun at the same time experience. We went to the Mets game but in Kissimee. It was like 40 degrees and i was in shorts and a light sweatshirt. We were SO COLD. We left in the 5th inning. Then we went down to Auchwitz...shit i mean IHOP and are waitress was like Polish or sumthin and she was all like "Ello and velcom to IHEP." That was my couple days.

      Today was the last day of FCAT thank G-d! We had to take this NRT thingy which I still don't undertand the logic behind it. Then when I got home, the silver bracelet my dad got me came in the mail. Its really cool. Tomorrow will be fun because me and my parents are going to a Mets spring training game down in Port St. Lucie. Thats it for now, chow. Hey that rhymes...cool.

      Damn , FCAT sucks balls. The test was pretty easy even though Ms. Massey hadn't tought us half the stuff... stupid dot head. lol. The worst part is when you are done having to sit and wait for like 30 min for time to expire. Anyway, when I got home I did the usual monday routine; go to guitar lessons at 5:30, then go to Too Jays with my mom ...by the way, their motzot ball soup is awesome! lol. Thats it.

      Today was better than usual. I went to Festival Bay with Stacey wich was cool but we didn't really get to talk...about stuff. I really hope she doesn't do anything stupid. But thats none of my bussiness. Then we went to Vans Skate Park and watched the people bail. Stacey is convinced that I don't know how she feels but when I tell her that even though I have never been through it myself, I still have a little idea she still says no which is kind of annoying me...oh well. I think i'll call Chad now.

      Today went as usuall,wake up, eat, go to school, come home, and do it all again like one big fuckin circle of joy. Anyways, the best part of my day was seeing stacy and she let me copy her Yellowcard CD which by the way kicks ass lol. Oh and i felt like such a dumbass in 5th period cuz me, deidra or is it spelled diedra, and stacey were talkin about homosexuallity and i said that gay marriage was wrong. I forgot that deidra's aunt was gay and she was about to get married. I was like "Oh shit im so sorry!" but she was so pissed and i dont blame her. Oh well. Later.

      Today was pretty much normal. Tim tried to throw a stink bomb into the courtyard  at school but he accidentaly hit some girl with it. lol. Except for that, not one interesting thing happened today...well actually in 4th period I found out im passing math! That was cool but everything else sucked. For some reason everytime I tried to talk to Stacey today I felt really awkward.lol. Anyways, after school I went to Hot Topic at the mall and got a Led Zeppelin shirt, pants, a West Coast Choppers wristband and a Metalica wallet. Well thats about it for today.

       Today was pretty much normal. This morning I went to tutoring but I just went to talk with Stacey. We didnt do much work lol. Thomas better remember to burn that Jet CD. The most interesting part of my day was after school I talked to Edgar and Stacey. We told him about how we were just joking about the sex thing. So after I talked to them for a while I was talking to Tim P. and he told me about this bot thing you can IM on AOL. It is so funny. Bye.

      Hey people. Today my dad's friend is coming to pull up our carpet and lay down this wood-like stuff lol. It isn't real wood because of our dog; she would scratch it up and stuff. So I have to stay out of his way so most of the day I will either be on the computer or watching T.V. Tomorrow I will probably look up some info on Dimebag Darrel for the gay project thingy in guitar class *ugh*. My presentation is do Thursday.

      Stacey said she loves me! lol. So last night I spent the night at Anthony's house. He got a strobe light and it was awesome! I was playing my guitar with it on and it looked like I was playing in slow motion lol. So I have decided that before I die I will have sex with a strobe light on. Yay! So today I spent most of the day over there, and while we were playing around with jis little brother, Anthony slid into my foot and he tore off part of my toe nail. It hurt like a bitch! I couldn't put my shoe on all day lol. When I got home I just talked to Stacey and played my guitar.

      Since nothing happend today I will tell you about yesterday. School was pretty gay as usuall but entertaining. At lunch Tim's table was throwing around a burrito wrapped up in a plastic bag. Someone threw it at Tim and it opened up! The meat and everything got all over his jersey! That jersey is expensive because I have the same kind but a different team. He got it all off but there was a huge stain. I was happy because Mr. Moser didn't give us assigned seats or anything so I can still sit next to Thomas and Stacey. Then when I got home I watched the Yankees get killed by the Red Sox while I talked too Stacey on the phone. Oh and on Thursday, we were talking about blowjobs or something on the phone and she was like "I will make you screa......oh, hi mom." I was like OMG what perfect timing lol. That was hilarious!

      Not much to talk about today. When I got to school Tim was really hyper lol. He said he is going to be the next Hitler but only against spics and niggers and stuff. It is always a good to see Stacey and nothing else really happened. Boring, boring, boring!

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while. The concert on Sunday was awesome! I went over to Stacey's house around 4:30 and she showed me around her house and stuff until it was time for the concert. When we got there the line was very long, but hey what can you do. We were able to get close to the stage but once it started Keith and I got caught up in a moshpit and almost died lol. We couldn't find Stacey so we moved to safer territory. Then after the concert was over we cought up with her. She told us that the lead guitarist had givin her his pick which I thought was pretty cool.I had a great time even though......nevermind. Everything else has just been same old-same old. School was REALLY boring today lol.

      Today started out like it was going to be a bad day. When I got on the bus, Chad was being a total ass hole. It was just a whole bunch of crap he said to me that didn't make sense. But then, once I got to school, everything seemed to get better. Oh and yesterday I went to the Yankee game. It was fun even though they lost...TO THE DEVIL RAYS! A total embarrassment. I was happy to see Stacey so cheerful today, but then she said she was taking Zoloft lol. She wrote me an E-mail telling me how much she hates her life and I want to help her sooo much but I know I can't :( Though I am happy that she feels she can trust me which she can. I think she and Thomas were flirting a little bit in 5th period which made me feel kind of weird. I am going to go to bed now, I am really tired.

      TGIF! Even though I didn't get to see Stacey, it was still a good day. Oh and congrats on your superior rating thing. Today was D-day.....report card day. Wasn't too bad. 5 C's and 1 A. In 3rd period we worked on our project a little bit and then we started messing around. We started throwing stuff at Tim P. like markers and stuff. It was funny. When I got home I went to visit my Great Aunts who are visiting from Hilton Head S.C. I really missed them a lot. We went out to dinner and here I am now.

      Last day of school!...Well for me anyway because I am not going tomorrow lol. It wasn't all that eventful. We only went to our first, third, and fifth periods. So first in Ms. Massey all I did was talk with Jessica, Tim P., and that other girl but I forgot her name. Then in Ms. Castro....oops I mean Ferrer we all threw paper at each other and got in trouble. Then Tim W. flipped a desk over and was standing on it and Krystal pushed him and he fell and smashed his chin on one of the bars! He had a huge gash on the side of his chin and you could see the bone. Krystal was so sorry and we were like messing with her saying how his parents could press charges or something like that lol. I just talked to him and he said he had to get five stitches....ouch. Then in Mr. Moser I got sad 'cause we were all ther but then next to me there was Stacey's extra seat. But anyway, we had a really gay test. We had to write the numbers and colors of all of the languages we learned...but he ended up giving us all of the answers lol. We also had to write a five paragraph essay on the language of Japanese and I was like yeah right, I aint doing that! Thats it for today.

      Ok so Tim W. told me that Tim P. was just screwing around with me. But he still is moving but only to Kissimmee which is a lot better lol. So even though he probably won' be at Freedom High I can still hang with him.

      Ok this is starting to get out of hand! I am talking to Tim P. and I was like are you going to school on monday and he said no and when I asked why he was like "I am packing." When I asked why he said he is moving to Wakefield Massachusetts and the other day Chad said that in 10th grade he might move to either Germany or Canada because his mom is a teacher and they may do this teacher exchange program...but if he were to move today, frankly I wouldn't give a you know what because he ass been a real jerk lately....but still. My life is getting kinda gay right now.

      Yesterday was pretty fun. First I was happy because Stacey called and said I could come over. So around 10:30 I went over to her house where Stacey, Kieth, and Deidra were waiting for me. We walked around her neighborhood  for a while and then when we were towards the back we saw cows over the fence. We were like WTF is that?!?! At first I thought it was a horse but then when we got closer and I saw it was a cow lol. I didn't know that cows could live in the woods. When we were in her house we tried to do the Bloody Mary thing in the bathroom....I wonder if all four of us going in the bathroom looked wrong...anyway we were staring at the mirror in the dark and it was dead silent until WHAM!!!! Stacey's dad banged on the door and it scared the crap out of everyone lol. Then we listened to Lynard Skynard and looked at pictures. At 12:15 we went outside to wait for my mom to pick me up because my aunt, uncle, and cousin are down from NJ. We just sat on the bench and when they came I was really sad because that was probably the last time I was gonna see Stacey for a while. So I gave her a hug and kiss goodbye and went on my way. For some reason Deidra keeps on calling the two of us "Grandma and Grandpa".....whatever lol. Then I went out to lunch with the folks and we went to the pool. After dinner my uncle, cousin and I all went mini golfing lol. My lil cousin won, my uncle came in 2nd and of course I lost. We got outa there at about 11:00 and then we went to Hooters for dessert lmao. That was the first time my cousin who is 10 had been there. My uncle was like wow, I was like omg and Justin was like wtf? *sigh* good times. Now I just got back from the pool and I am stuffing my face with CHEEZ-ITs lol.

      Let me break down one of the crappiest days in recent memory. First I had to drag around textbooks in my backpack all day so it weighed like 10000000000000000000 pounds. Then I got to hear about some more gross STDs which made me feel real good about sex. Then in guitar I remembered I had to take home my guitar today so I had to text message my mom telling her to pick me up. Then in third period we read our letters that our parents wrote to us in August. My dad wrote some really nice stuff but for some reason I got really sad. Then in Math we had a Big 25 that nobody knew about. I was supposed to serve lunch detention today but I didn't. We had a test in Mr. Moser but we ended up talking about politics all period which is ok with me. In history we had a test and even though it was open-book I still think I did bad. At the end of sixth period we had to go to our homeroom from the beginning of the year. I had to go to Mr. Ryder who is like my favorite teacher. Atleast I got to talk to Jason during that time. Then I was planning on saying my final goodbye to Stacey...maybe a kiss or SOMETHING! But nooooo.....I couldn't even do that because since we had to go to our homerooms, after school I couldn't find where Stacey was...I looked all over. She told me that she was waiting by the stairs and then she went to my bus. So I must have looked by the stairs while she was at my bus. She looked for me by the bus but I was a car rider today. FUCK!! Im so pissed. Things just happened to work out in all the wrong ways today. Oh and I was supposed to spend the night at Austin's house but tonight his mom just changed her mind out of the blue and said that I couldn't. Now I am trying to call Stacey but I can't get through....today was fucked. *sigh*

      Stacey only has one day left...NOOO!!!!! Tomorrow is gonna totally suck. I am gonna hate it so much to not have her around. The only interesting thing that happened today was I went over to Austin's house earlier and we watched "Scary Movie 3" and damn that movie is funny lol. Then we wrote my song that I made up on his computer and I think it is pretty good....but thats just me. Tomorrow the only good thing thats gonna happen is that I am gonna spend the night at his house. We are probably going to be up all night writing music and jamming which will be cool. But after going to his house I know what I want for my birthday lol. I want this affects pedal he has...it totally rocks balls dude. I played my lil guitar solo on it using the wah wah and I was like holy shit!

      School was at times fun and at times gay....just like most other days. In first period we watched another video about STDs....yuck....it is so nasty, I always get grossed out. On the way to third period this kid had a big Ziploc bag and he ripped it down the side and (with my sick imagination and all) it kinda looked like a Klan hood. So I took it and I drew eye holes in it and it lookes awesome lol. In third period I found out that both me and Jon got perfect scores on our DRPs! I was like so happy cuz for a sec I actually felt kinda.....smart. So nothing else really happened....everyone was pretty happy for the most part and I realized how much I am gonna miss being with all of my friends and pissin off the teachers. And Stacey, for the last time I wasn't having an orgasm! lmao (dont ask). So today I was in the car and I told my parents a racist joke and my mom was like "Ryan, you don't really mean these things when you say them right? You are just kidding?" I was like "Um...yeah...sure mom..." My dad who unkowingly taught me the tools of the trade was lookin at her like wtf are u talkin about lol. I didn't wanna say nothin cuz then she would just start sayin how tim is a bad influence on me and alla this other shit when he has nothin to do with it...so I kept my big mouth shut for once lol.

      It is Wednesday morning and last night I was really sad. I went to bed listining to my Yellowcard CD and since that always reminds me of her when I listen to it I got really sad....I didn't cry....well maybe a little bit....ok a lot. All I have been doing the past few days is playing my guitar and listening to music...all that stuff calms me down. Plus I love music anyway so whether I am sad or not thats basically all I do lol. Well I must be off to school now but I will try to post later...*sigh*

      Yesterday and today really kinda sucked. Yesterday I went to guitar lessons and I bought Stacey a Red Hot Chili Peppers music book as a little going away gift. I hope she liked it...I think she did. Both yesterday and today in 4th period people were crying...I felt really bad. Samantha was crying like crazy both yesterday and today...I mean it is sad but I think she might be over reacting a wee bit. She only knew Stacey for like half the year and she is acting like her best friend just died...oh well everyone is different I guess lol. Then in 5th we were doing our Japanese dialogues at the "cracker table" and all of a sudden she started to cry....I felt SOOOOO BAD. Oh yeah and in 3rd period we were having WWII with paper balls lol. Tim W., Tim P, Alex, Canh and yours truely were running around the room throwing paper at each other...we were like rolling behind desks in stuff....it was a lot of fun....man I am gonna miss all of this crazy shit :( So in 6th period Nick Dexter who is black had to go to Mr. Carter so she was like u better have Mr. Carter call my room to let me know you are there or I will send my "posse" after you and both me and Tim were like she's gonna send the klan lmao. So today was pretty eventful...tomorrow is Wednesday...shit....

      Man o man am I depressed. I talked to Stacey all day and I was like "Well do you know when you will be moving?" (assuming it was around the 28th) and she asked and they are moving THIS COMING SATURDAY! Dude....total bummer. I was soooo sad and still am. She started crying on the phone and I felt SO bad I wanted to go over there and hold her close. :( Dammit and everytime I would forget about it I would look over at the photos and be like "Oh shit....I forgot about that." Yeah and I was hoping to do something with her next weekend as like a final day together but I guess we can't now. I am going to go in early monday to meet her. WTF some person I don't even know IMed me asking if I wanted to watch her on her webcam. lol thats kinda weird yet funny at the same time.

      Nothing in school really happemed except we got our yearbooks. Everybody was signing and stuff and both Stacey and Paola put really nice things. Then after school we waited until 5:00 and then we went to the dinner thing. We had KFC lol. Some people were dressed up really nice. Stacey wore a nice black dress and she looked real pretty. Oh yeah I almost forgot, the black lady came in to talkl about sex. We talked about why we should and shouldn't have sex. When we were doing why we shouldn't she was like "Don't have sex with them if they have 'coochie critters.'" LMFAO omg that was so funny. Yeah so back to the dance. After the dinner we all went to the gym for the dance. I was going with STacey and Tim W. was going with Paola. So when we got there in the beginning I felt like such a LOSER because I was to shy to dance. I think Tim was to because when Paola would try to dance with him he would silently asy to me "Please help!" But the only problem was I felt the same way. I wanted to dance so badly but I don't know.....I was shy lol. But then later on I kinda loosened up a bit. So I had a really good time with Stacey and when we were slow dancing I wanted to give her a kiss but like I said im too fucking shy. Yeah so that was my day and I am really sad cause' I dont want her to move....*sigh*

      Well in the beginning of the day nothing really happened but in lunch they crushed up a PBJ sandwich and threw it at Tim and then he fell out of his chair and started having a spastic fit on the floor. Mr. Carter was like "Tim, get up here!" He had to spend the rest of lunch up in lunch detention. It was so funny lmao. In 5th period something good happened but im not saying anything because well....just nevermind lol. Oh yeah I almost forgot, that Shvartzer is coming to school tomorrow. Shvartzer is Yiddish for nigger and you say it like shvatsa. Wow you just learned a new word and black people don't even know what your talking about when you say it lol. But anyway, yeah she is coming again to talk to us about sex and stuff just like last week.

      OMG today was SO stressful you have no idea! Ok so first I get to school at like 8:25 and I didn't realize that I needed all of my teachers to sign this paper saying that I would be in guitar class all day. So Chris and I went around to all of my teachers to get them to sign. Oh and I wore kacki shorts and a golf shirt for the concert so at about 9:00 I go to the stage to get tuned and everything and she was like "Are you going to change your shorts?" I was like "Um....no, I thought you said no jeans." It turns out you can't wear jeans or shorts but all I had were jeans and those shorts so I told her that and she said that LONG jeans would be ok. Sebastian, who is a skinny little nothing said he had an extra pair of jeans so I went to try those....and people keep in mind the show was in a half an hour, but ofcourse they were too small because im a fat ass lol. So then I was like oh fuck I am not going to be able to play but then I called my mom and she drove home and brought me some jeans so I ran and put those on, got my guitar, tuned up (It was seriously out of tune lol), and practiced a little bit with Austin all in time for the concert. Holy crap I was....there is no word to describe the way I was feeling. So we did surprisingly well....the last few groups that is. She put us in order from worst to best, best went last. We did good...everyone cheered and stuff and it felt good after practicing so much. Yeah so that was basically it, after that we just stayed inm the class room and watched "Shool of Rock" and jammed. After school I went to visit my grandma at the hospitol. That was my day.

      Today I learned that there is both a Ku Klux Klan, and a Neo-Nazi organization right here in good old Orlando. What that means is I better whatch my fuckin back when I am walking down the street lol. I also changed my blog template and I think it looks cool other than the purple text under "Archives" and "Recent posts" lol. So not much is really going on in my world right now....Stacey is moving soon and that is going to suck a lot. I feel bad for her because nothing seems to be going right for her in the past few weeks. My guitar concert is tomorrow so I won't be able to see her at all because the class is just going to hang out all day :( I really am not looking foward to dressing up for the recital but whatever. Bye.                             (*J*KK all the way) lol

      Hey everyone. Yeah so last Friday we had this black lady come in and talk to us about....you guessed it, sex! It was really funny. She asked the guys first what we liked in a girl but we only said like five things. I think we said personality, a sence of humor, all the rappers said big butts and me and Tim were like "WTF thats kinda weird." lol. Then Tien was like "BIG TITS!!!" Then she was like "You have to be respectful, you should say big breasts, not tits." *lmao* Then the girls said like twenty things and I aint kidding. Over the weekend I did nothing woeth telling, well...hehe...jk lol. Today in 1st period we watched this gay video from the eighties that we already watched a long time ago about peer pressure or some crap like that. In Moser we started German. I really like that language but I don't know why. So my guitar concert recital thing is in two days but it is going to be during !st period so that totally blows big time because now Stacey probably won't be able to come. Shit! I just found out Stacey's parents sold her guitar. I was going to get her a going-away gift that had to do with guitar but now I guess I will have to think of something else...oh wait, Stacey you are probably reading this....oh well w/e.

      Happy Cinco De Mayo everyone! Wait...someone shoot me quick! Cinco De Mayo is like the dumbest holiday I have ever heard of. I think a bunch of Mexicans got bored and decided to come up with a holiday. When they couldn't think of a name they were like, "¡Hey hombre! You know how those Gringos up in the U.S. have The Fourth of July? Well we can just pick a day like May 5th and make it our own holiday, but we can call it Cinco De Mayo! Oh well...what can you do lol.   So Stacey's concert is tomorrow and I hope I can go. It would be cool to see her perform. My guitar concert is on the 12th and Austin and I are going to play "Zephyr Song" by Red Hot Chili Peppers....yay!

      IOA was really fun. I went on The Hulk and it was fun....I finally faced my fear of rollercoasters! I also went on Dueling Dragons and it was okay I guess. We went on this one water ride and both me and Tim P. got soaked....I had water EVERYWHERE lol. I felt like my nuts were floating beneath me lol. Before we left we went on The Hulk like three more times but then I got dizzy and Tim had a headache so we were like thats enough lol. Oh and OMG Jessica's boob popped out in the picture LMFAO. Tim was like "Damn I missed it!" Today was awesome!

      Today was full of spics and niggers lol. First in 3rd period this Puerto Rican girl was buying candy from Krystal and I tried to take it from her and she was like "Get off my candy boy!" Then I said "Who are you callin boy?!" Then Krystal and Marcel were arguing and I said to Krystal "You're white, it's alright." But Marcel didn't pick up on it. *sigh*. Then at lunch Thomas was like "FUCKIN NIGGERS!" We both turned beet red because he said it so loud...omg lol. Then in 6th we had a pizza party thingo and me and Tim P. were saying spic a lot little did we know there was a whole table of them behind us lol. Then they were giving us dirty looks. We also made Klan hats out of our napkins and put them on the Sprite cans lmao. Well, now I am talking to Stacey on the phone...bye.

      Today when I woke up, my mom was at the movies with her friend. I went on the computer and talked to Stacey and Tim W. I was annoyed because Tim kept on making all these Jew jokes and wouldn't stop. With Tim P. he would say something like that but he would stop when I would get pissed off. But Tim doesn't stop lol. Then I started on my math project and Stacey and I were trying to figure out the circle graph thing. So that's pretty much it.....exciting day, eh?

      Yesterday was pretty much as usual. Today I was gonna sleep in but I ended up waking up at ten! But that was only so I could go to some of the garage sales...lol. Then I spent the day at Thomas' house. He got a new guitar so we just played our guitars and stuff. THen I went to the mall. Since Stacey went multicultural in her blog, I will to lol.                                        Genießen Sie das Leben, während Sie können.

      Hey everyone. Just sittin here...playin my guitar. My Grandpa is a really good piano player so I wanted to see if he could play "Sairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin and a few people who have cared to ask know that I LOVE them....not in a gay way you frikkin pervs but y'all know what I mean. But he couldn't cuz a few of the parts are like two chords mixed together and he couldn't do that on piano. If you notice at the top of my bloggie I changed my little quote thing. It's from a song by Yngwie Malmsteen who is a totally awesome guitar player....plus I think he may be Jewish with a last name like Malmsteen lol. But if you thought Van Halen was fast, you should check out some of his old albums. Thats all for now.

      Ok well I woke up pretty early today...around 8 and thats like the earlies since school started. Stacey, you hypocrite, now YOU need to write in your blog lol. Well you know how both Reagan and Ray Charles died  recently? Well there has been all of this stuff about Reagan on T.V. and everything but nobody cares about Ray and you know why? It's because he is black lol....but I am serious. The only T.V. stations that probably care about him are BET and VH1....VH1 cause last night they mentioned it but all it was was a lil thing goin across the bottom of the screen for two seconds....but maybe im wrong, maybe we do live in a racially equal society....no....nevermind.

Yeah it was kind of nasty but it was a funny movie so whatever. Well I am just sitting here....doing nothing....bored. Call me Stacey! This summer hasn't exactly been all that fun. All I do is sit around, watch T.V, and play videogames. Maybe once and I while I will hang out with some friends but that is rare. So...ya nothin else to say....

      Today was kinda boring. I was looking forward to having a relaxing day but of course I knew that wasn't gonna happen and while I was on the computer my mom went to go to the bank and the car wouldn't start. So then we hed to wait for the tow truck dude to come and THEN we had to go to the car place and wait for TWO HOURS until it was ready. Then when I finally got home I was able to relax. I talked to Stacey on the phone and on AOL and I also talked to Stacey's friend Brittany. She seems pretty nice and I am always happy to make a new friend lol. Well thats pretty much it today. Bye.

I really want to call Stacey but whenever I have free time it is either late at night or I don't have time because we are about to do something....*sigh* oh well. And I would call her now but we are about to watch a DVD...."Scary Movie 3" cuz my parents never saw it lol. Oh and I wen to go see "The Day After Tomorrow"....It was good, the effects and stuff were cool but the story was kinda hmm....weak but it was still good and y'all should go see it.

      Hey people. My dad is TRYING to get AOL back on our computer so I should be back soon. Im at the library right now so thats how I am on. Even though I haven't posted in a while I really have nothing to talk about lol. I am learning to play "Slither" by Velvet Revolver....I really like that band and especially that song. You gotta love Guns n' Roses lol. I have probably purchased like 10 CD's since I last wrote in my blog......Slipknot,Velvet Revolver, Best of Guns n' Roses, and some others. I talked to Stacey yesterday to get her address because her B-day is comin up so I knew where to send like a card or something. I spent the night at Chad's house the other night and we had tacos for dinner and we both put a whole shit load of tobasco sauce on them and...yeah...it wasn't too fun lol. Great pain inside my mouth...lets just say that. Well thats all that I can remember to talk about so hopefully my internet at home will be working soon or else I will just have to come back to this G-d damn library place.
