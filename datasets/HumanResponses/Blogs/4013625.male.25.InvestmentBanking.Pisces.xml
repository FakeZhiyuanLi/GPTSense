      Welcome to the begining of something not so speacial or entertaining. Shrinks are too much money and my handwriting is too bad to have a diary. So here lies my dirty laundry and skeletons in the closet. Or, just me rambling on as I pretend hundreds of people stop by and read this thinking I am soooooo clever and funny. Thank you, thank you, I love you all. Um, damn, I am pathetic. Check out our new baby birds, and Amber's hand! Aren't they cute?

      And on Sept. 15 I will move in. So October 22 weekend looks like a good up north weekend for everyone who will attend. Please look at the calander and tell me if that weekend looks good or not. Its the 4th weekend of 5. The 5th will obviously be Halloween so that weekend is out. The weather should be outstanding in late october up there with no bugs, but still kinda warm in the daytime. Leave a post or email or call me and let me know if you think thats a good time to go, if you have shit to do just say so and maybe we will move it back a week. For those of you who don't know my pager, it's 800-938-2697. Try it some time, it's fun.

      Kinda, waiting for them to accept the offer. They are asking $147,000, I offered $145,000, so we'll see. I am sure they will take it. But no above ground pool because it's not the house I put a picture of below. Unfortunatly i don't have a picture yet, so when I own it I will take a picture and post it for all to see. It is on the Redford-Livonia border, and it's close to I-96. There are many strip clubs with in 10 minutes so there is plenty to do at night. Or during the day now that I think of it. I am buying it because it has a grill with a gas line from the house, so you never run out of gas. That IS the only reason I want the house. Oh and at work I am trying to secure R. Wallace's loan on a 8.4 million dollar house. He is buying it right now and I am trying to get the deal since he used a realtor at my office. Some old lady at Century 21 who I am willing to sleep with if she can get this deal for me. Quick reference for ya, if I made 1 point on the deal, that would equal $40,000 in my pocket. I can live with that. Don't think I will get it because I am too young, white, non jewish, and I have a big nose, but who knows?

      No more fun for you! The terrorists are going to bomb your car, boat, plane, dog, toilet, and electric shaver come election time. Wow I never get sick of hearing about that. Everyday, "we have intelligence that says they are preparing to strike America". No shit! They hate us, and so help me GOD they better not postpone the election for "our saftey" or I'll...um...well... I'll sit back and take it like every other American. Damn, we should stop giving so much attention to it. But on the other hand, fear sells well. So everyday my home page will have "breaking news" on how I'm in danger. Statistically speaking, I'm in no danger. Better chance getting hurt driving today then getting bombed. "Breaking news" you can get hurt driving!!!! Don't get in your cars. Silverware can be sharp. No more eating for anyone! Sporks are the new utensil of choice. Oh wait, that's already the case in airports and on planes. Damn, even trying to make fun of it unveils how crazy it has become. Sorry, enough from me.

       	 		 		 Well, I'm making an offer today. It's a good deal on a house. I'm not gonna tell anyone untill they except the offer, just to see if anyone really reads this. Sure their is more living space in my cabin up north, but this one has great schools! And look, a non-heated above ground pool. I'll be the most popular kid on the block! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink 9UUK8OCARMAA72 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink etarak .

      So i just keep coming here and typing stuff? Um, well our birds flew away. It was sad, I wasn't ready for them to go. Actually Amber forced their first flight with fear. She was trying to pet them, and they took flight for the first time never to return, leaving their nest and many turds behind. I'll get a new picture of them up soon. I am watching Simple Life 2, it's kinda like Saved by the Bell, in that they both are not good shows, but if you come across them, you watch them and you don't why. I'm looking at houses again this week, hopefully I catch a good one. I'll let everyone know if I find one. The big fun weekend at the cabin will be in October. I am trying to pick a week so if you know you can't go on a weekend, then let me know! I was thinkin like last weekend of the month. Peace out my Niggaz!
