      Yamatopia has arrived.  Although it destroyed the old journal, Yamatopia should prove to be far superior than that of its predecessor.  I have always liked new things.  There's something nice about that shiny, new trinket.  I like that new idea that catches everybody by surprise, makes them second guess, trip in their steps.  What is Yamatopia?  I am sure there are a few of you who are tasking that question.  I talked to my mom the other day on the phone and she asked me what this "Yamahoogieha" deal is all about.  Yamatopia is actually a simply constructed play on words.  I have combined "Yamato" and "pia."  Yamato, or 大和, is a Japanese word.  It is one of my favorite words in the language and a prime example of why I am attracted to it.  There aren't too many words like it in English, if any.  It means Japan, the land; the Japanese people; Japanese ideas; Japanese food; everything that is Japanese about Japan.  Facts, ideas, opinions, tastes, spirit: all of these ideas wrapped up in a single word is beautiful.  Without the kanji, it wouldn't be nearly as effective, either.  To top it all off, the Chinese characters used to represent this concept portray "great peace."  Could this be the final goal of the Japanese culture?  The second word I have fused is "pia" from "Utopia."  The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines utopia as:   Main Entry: uto·pia  Pronunciation: yu-'tO-pE-& Function: noun Etymology: Utopia, imaginary and ideal country in Utopia (1516) by Sir Thomas More, from Greek ou not, no + topos place 1 : an imaginary and indefinitely remote place 2 often capitalized : a place of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions 3 : an impractical scheme for social improvement   I hope that this site has a little bit of each of those definitions in it.  The Internet is definitely remote, in a place that can't be touched by our hands, only interpreted through our eyes and minds.  Total perfection, something I ultimately seek for myself, hoping that this site is one means to that end.  My ends are, of course, impractical at best.  I have many goals for this new site.  First of all, I hope that it can be a vehicle for communication with my friends and family back home.  I want to use it more effectively and wisely than I did with my last journal, which I rarely updated or paid enough attention to.  I also want to use it to look deeper into myself.  Since I came to Japan, ascending the peak that had been my goal through the years up to that moment, I have slacked off in some ways.  One of those is in self-improvement.  I have stopped looking inwards for answers and keep looking outside with blurred vision.  With a journal, I hope to force myself to look inside, to look deeper and deeper until I begin to uncover new things.  I also hope to sharpen by writing skills.  In addition to this journal, Yamatopia is also made up of a Mob Blog, a photo journal.  I have just started it up as well.  You can find the link over on the right margin.  This site is generated by photos that I send from my cell phone.  Since I usually don't have my camera with me, if something strikes me as interesting or strange, I've only got the camera on my cell phone to record it.  Once I have taken a picture, I can send an e-mail to my account at the Mob Blog and it displays on the website along with comments I provide.  My photo albums can still be found on Yahoo Photos, but I hope to upgrade that as well as soon as possible.  I look forward to comments and suggestions and conversation.  I hope to talk more about my daily life on this site and talk about some issues.  I want to hear your side of things as well, so write away!  And with that, I bid you welcome to Yamatopia.

      I just finished up a very much needed day of cleaning at my place.  It was turning into a nightmare.  To accelerate the cleaning of this place, I invited three friends over for dinner.  If they were coming, I HAD to get the place clean, right?  Well it worked!  My place looks a million times better and soon we will be sitting down to a homecooked meal to feast like kings!  This will also usher in my reign of cooking that I intend to enforce upon my kitchen.  I have more to write, but don't have all the words yet.  Look for an update by tomorrow or so.

      So here I sit at the computer with a Mitsuya Cider after a long day.  I just finished up an English class I have with four friends.  It's always a lot of fun for some reason.  There's a really good student-teacher chemistry on top of our friendships.  They study really hard during class and a couple even study by themselves.  It's great!  I love being able to teach to people who want to learn what I'm teaching. (Here's where you say, "Oh, yeah, Chris works at a  public  school.  He's not used to that.)  Today was my school's 体育祭 (taiikusai).  That pretty much translates to P.E. Festival, Sports Festival or Field Day.  It was good fun.  The kids did all sorts of things like 6-Legged Races, Relays, Tug of War, Bean Bag Tossing... the works.  I spent most of the time wandering around talking to students.  Now that the end of my time at Nanko is getting close, I am slowing revealing the extent of my Japanese ability.  When I first got there, I decided to keep my skills secret; I wanted the students to speak English and for time with me to be "educational."  Now that I will be leaving soon, my selfishness sets in a bit. :)  I want to have as much fun with these kids as I can before I leave.  To do that, I have to whip out the Japanese and show them that they can talk to me like their friends (minus some of that new-fangled slang that older people can never keep up with).  This is usually met with lots of ooh!-s and aaah!-s.  It's good fun in itself.  I love it when it takes them a little while to figure out what's happening and after like 5 or 10 minutes of talking, one suddenly blurts out, "You're speaking Japanese!"  I talked to a mother of one of my students who was there cheering for her son and she asked if I had lived in Osaka because of my accent/dialect.  I was very pleased. :)

      Well Tsu is recovering after its illicit affair yesterday with Typhoon #6.  The beast of a storm wound its way up from South of Okinawa and bulldozed through here.  When I woke up yesterday morning, things were pretty calm.  It was a bit windy, but there was no rain.  So I headed out to school.  Since I knew the storm was coming, I took the bus instead of my bike since a 30 minute bicycle ride in a typhoon spells B R O K E N B O N E S.  While I was on the bus, the rain started coming down and the winds picked up.  I've only got a 5 minute walk from the bus stop to my school.  In those 5 minutes, I got soaked and my umbrella got turned into a pretzel.  Not a great start to the day.  Things kept getting better when I got to school only to find out that the students weren't coming in because of the storm.  All of us teachers have to come in, though, and just sit on our butts or go to meetings or what not.  I got paid and it's my job, so I don't really have any qualms with it, but the logic confuses me.  If the weather is deemed so bad that students cannot come, why must the teachers show up?  Are the students' lives worth more than the teachers?  Now I love my students, so I am glad that if there is a perceived danger they are kept out of harm's way.  What about throwing some scraps to the teachers, though!?  Some have 30-40 minute commutes by car.  That's pretty dangerous mid-Typhoon.  I asked some teachers why we were required to come in and the answer was just 'We are civil servants.'  That's loyalty for you.

      Something happened about a week ago and at first I was reluctant to talk about it.  I've been in a bad mood and it is hard to deal with it again and again.  Shoko and I decided to call it quits.  I guess it would be more accurate to say that I asked to call it quits and [this time] she was very willing to understand.  Anybody who knows about us knew about the ups and downs.  We've had problems in the past and even though we tried to deal with them, they got the best of us.  I think I knew a ways back that it wasn't going to work out with her.  I have never had to break up with someone before, though, and it was very difficult.  To have to reject someone you love and care about is hard... one of the hardest things I have had to do.  What hurt the most was that she was so invested in things.  She tried so hard.  It's strange how people can try so hard to make something work, something that is impossible to start with.  I think I got too caught up in trying to fix things that couldn't be fixed.  My immaturity contributed a lot to my indecisiveness.  Relationships are crazy and I'll be damned if I ever figure them out entirely. :)  This is for the best, though, as hard as it is.  I have to remind myself that sometimes, especially if I'm alone or before I go to bed.  I know this will pass, though, and bigger and brighter times are in store for Shoko and myself.  There isn't any bad blood between us and I think that once wounds heal, we'll be able to be good friends again.  Ok, now that that's off my chest! Last night's curry dinner went great!  All the food came out great and everyone was impressed.  I definitely enjoy cooking.  It's just that it sucks cooking for just one person!  When I have friends coming over, it's so much fun preparing a meal, getting dishes out, etc.  But when I know it's just me who's going to be eating, it seems like so much  work  for  nothing .  Guess I need to have friends over more!!!

      Well I'm about to start up another crazy week.  Last week was pretty interesting.  It was term exams at Nanko, so I got to visit some kindergartens and elementary schools.  I got to visit Isshinden Elementary again.  The teachers really like me there.  I don't know why, though.  For the first two period of the day, I worked with the special needs class.  We did some really easy English along with some easy games.  Most of the kids had grown up a lot since I was last there.  I swear some of the boys looked taller.  They also looked like they were dealing with their problems better.  They had a lot more self-control.  Also, a couple of the girls who never really spoke before finally could call out some of the English vocabulary.  For third and fourth period, I had to give a lecture to all the sixth graders (about 90) about American culture.  At first I thought it was going to be a nightmare!  They did not tell me it was going to be 90 students, so I planned a lesson for one class and was hoping to use the chalkboard and stuff.  When I got there, they said it was going to be all 90 students in the gym.  I was pretty irked.  Things worked out well, though.  Somehow I managed to keep the kids interested for 90 minutes. I don't know how I did it.  Did I mention this was all in Japanese!?  Good practice for me, too, I guess.  I also got to visit a new elementary school, Kambe Elementary.  It is out in the middle of a bunch of rice fields.  It's very serene and peaceful.  The students were all very sweet and the teachers were much more relaxed than at other schools.  It was a lot of fun.  I will be going back there next semester for a month or so and can't wait!  It's going to be a blast!  Today I went to Osaka to watch Kabuki for the first time!  It was really exciting.  I was not exactly sure what to expect.  I think the ideas I had about Kabuki were pretty off.  It was interesting, but I am not sure how some people can get really obsessed with it.  I guess it is similar to people in the States who like watching Shakespeare productions.  The language is very old-style.  One thing that was really cool is that a lot of the old guys who had been watching Kabuki for years cheered the performers on at key points during the act.  Apparently there are precise moments and precise types of cheers that you are supposed to use.  Some of the guys who weren't getting it right were being told by the theatre staff to be quiet.  I was kind of faling asleep near the end. ^_^

      So here I am in Seoul at some crazy huge Expo.&nbsp; I have no idea what is going on because everything is in Korean.&nbsp; I won't be back until the 25th, so I won't be able to update the site again until after that.&nbsp; Look for some interesting stories and great pictures, though.&nbsp; Everybody, take care!

      Today Tsubasa and I had a crazy day. It all started early in the morning and our bus ride out to Osaek, an area famous for hot springs and hiking.&nbsp; The weather looked pretty good and we thought we were cool to go with our way too&nbsp;low supply of water.&nbsp; I should note, too, that I came to Korea with only a pair of sandals.&nbsp; One pair of sandals.&nbsp; I would climb a mountain in those sandals! The name of the mountain is something like Daechongbong (I will double check later).&nbsp; The hike is 5km to the top and then 5km back down.&nbsp; That's 10km... in my sandals!!! Early on, Tsubasa was injured as he grabbed onto a large branch for support, only to have it come down on his head and leave a nasty gash.&nbsp; I heard him grunt as he does when he is injured and he turned around, saying, "I think I'm bleeding."&nbsp; Indeed he was as a stream of blood covered his face from forehead to chin.&nbsp; Luckily, Super Chris had his handy roll of toilet paper and things were cleaned up quick. We resolved to move forward.&nbsp; Soon we met up with some old Korean guys enjoying the mountain as well.&nbsp; They saw Tsubasa's injury and offered him food and liquor to clear things up.&nbsp; Tsubasa accepted gladly.&nbsp; We had made it halfway up the mountain. Things got pretty rough from here on, especially for me in my sandals (yes, the sandals again).&nbsp; Finally, after 3 1/2 hours from start, we reached the peak.&nbsp; There was a magnificent wind blowing and many a hat of fellow trekker was scattered to the mountainside.&nbsp; My trusty hat remained steadfast, though.&nbsp; We took our victory pictures at the summit and rested.&nbsp; We also reached the end of our liquid supply. We started down again and it was rough.&nbsp; Without any water, we both had parched throats.&nbsp; I don't know exactly how Tsubasa was, but I was dizzy and thought I was going to pass out.&nbsp; My feet had also been torn to shreds climbing a MOUNTAIN IN MY SANDALS, so it was very, very slow going. Finally... victory!&nbsp; We had done it.&nbsp; We got back to the bottom of the mountain and rejoiced over Cokes and bottled water. Then came the coolest part of the day.&nbsp; At the bus stop, we bumped into two older guys who had just finished hiking.&nbsp; They had also just been drinking.&nbsp; They were going nuts over me and my sandals.&nbsp; One of the guys seemed to be lecturing me (in Korean) how crazy it was and that I could have died.&nbsp; The other guy, in broken English was saying how cool I was and that I had American Spirit and was like Arnold Schwarzenegger.&nbsp; He kept saying "cool guy! cool guy!"&nbsp; I wish I could have known somehow that he made my day saying that.&nbsp; I was so ragged and sore and tired from the hike and my feet felt like they were going to come off at the ankle.&nbsp; When he said that stuff, though, it got me reallly happy.&nbsp; Made me really proud of what I had done. &nbsp; The moral of the story: Never wear sandals to hike up a mountain, but if you do...you are a machine!!!

      So I made it back safe and sound from the land of kimchi. It was a fantastic trip and I think I will let the pictures do the talking.&nbsp; There was just too much that happened to talk about all of it here.&nbsp; Some highlights, though:   -Climbing a mountain IN MY SANDALS  -Staying a night at a Buddhist temple and training with them  -Fun nights out with cheap beer and shochu/soju  -Meeting lots of great, friendly people  -Meeting lots of people who spoke great English  -Spending an afternoon at the (supposedly) largest spa in Asia  -Eating so much good food  -While walking down a long road on a hot day, being picked up by total strangers and driven out of their way to the bus stop for us  -Seeing lots of cute girls  -A crazy night where we misplaced our motel -Seeing North Korea -Hanging at nightclub where they have a fighting ring in the center and seeing some K-1 Heavyweights like Akebono there  And on to the  urlLink pictures .

      July 14th was a big day.&nbsp; It was the last time (for a while, at least; never say never) that the three kings of the Kinki Mansion would be partying together.&nbsp; Adam, Chris and Tsubasa (in no particular order besides alphabetical) were going to have to party hard... and they did.&nbsp; The three of us started off at Shibata's, a great restaurant near the Kink.&nbsp; After we ate,&nbsp;met up at Snow Drop with Meghan, Shane, Jennie G and Kiwi Steve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We partied long and hard there until close and then headed off to Karaoke.&nbsp; We sang lots of classic songs and maybe even some new ones (I don't remember too well thanks to the shochu).&nbsp; It was an awesome night.&nbsp; Definitely a way to bring an end to an era and to open the curtain on a new one (more on this later).  Check out some pictures of the party  urlLink here . p.s. I took these pictures with my new digital camera, so they should hopefully look a bit nicer than pictures in the past. p.p.s Check out some more pictures of the party at Adam's site  urlLink here .

      It had been my school for 7 months.&nbsp; Nanko Junior High School in Tsu.&nbsp; Before I got there, I was warned by many teachers that it was going to be a tough school.&nbsp; It had a reputation for bad kids and stressed out teachers.&nbsp; I went in a bit nervous. I remember that soon after I got there, I realized that most of what I heard was very inaccurate.&nbsp; Sure, there were some trouble students, but they made up a very, very small minority of the students.&nbsp; Most of the kids there were great, fantastic kids with great personalities.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun there. It definitely wasn't as academic as my last junior high, Kyohoku, so I don't feel like I was able to contribute as much academically.&nbsp; I do feel like I had an influence on the kids, though, in the sense of giving them a good chance to interact with&nbsp;a foreigner.&nbsp; I hope they saw that we're not all strange and to be feared, that some of us speak Japanese, use chopsticks, that we're not really that different.&nbsp; If they saw that, then I'm pretty happy with how things went there. I had so much fun, though.&nbsp; There are some kids there I will never forget, that's for sure.&nbsp; I was glad to hear that Tsubasa will be visiting Nanko next year.&nbsp; I know he will do a great job there.  Here's some pictures from my last day  urlLink here .
