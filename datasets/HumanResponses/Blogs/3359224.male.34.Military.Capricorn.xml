       urlLink Unofficial Results   First off, if there is any one among you who believes the 48 Lowes Chevy will pass post-race tech, stop reading now.  This entry will only serve to piss you off.    For the rest of us:  I find it hard to believe that any one driver can gain a nearly 2 second lead a lap and a half after a restart.  Now, I don't have a copy of the NASCAR Rulke Book.  That seems to be some secret document stored right next to the master plates for the new $20 bill in the deepest darkest recesses of Fort Knox.  The only people who have access to it are any one from the France family and Jack Rousch.  I believe Mike Helton allows Jack to buy time with the book and gives him a pen to make changes as he sees fit.  Come on, Jimmie do you and Chad Knauss honestly expect all us dumbass race fans to believe that you just guys just nailed the setup that well?  I know its possible but I'm guessing your co-carowner, Jeff Gordon may have a word or two about you guys not passing your secret to him and the Rainbow Warriors.  I know I'ld be pissed if I got beat so badly by a car I paid half the bills for.  Call me silly but there's sportsmanship, and then there's looking out for your teammates not to mention your car owners.  Congrats to Mikey and Slugger and the whole crew.  You guys placed first as far as I am concerned.  I'm sure Mike Helton will agree when he gets done talking with Rick, Jeff, Chad and Jimmie in the big yellow truck.  Slugger complained during the race that the #15 Napa Chevy was at an aero disadvantage cause of the hole in the fender.  Well, guessing it worked out for ya Slugger.  You guys out ran Mr. Murphy.  Good on ya and the whole team.  I'll be thanking you by ordering the family Dominos tomorrow.  Thanks for the Mikey Special.  As for Jr.  What a run!  Glad to see the #8 team controlling thier over adjustments.  My heart about stopped when I heard Jr and Jr talking about a pit stop after the red flag restart.  I guess it worked cause Jr gained 4 spots after the restart.    As for our 3rd DEI team....not a bad showing for a guy who doesn't race in traffic that much.  Damn good to see the #1 back on the track either way.  Sure hope Snap On sees it the same way.  Not that I am a big fan of John Andretti.  He still has to proove himself as no longer being a Petty driver.   On the bad side.  Hated it for Mark Martin.  Mark is a hell of a driver and I hate to see him have a bad day even if he does drive for Jack in the Hat.  All in all...a damned good race.  Lots of long green flag racing.  Always love it when there's more racin than wreckin.  Makes the pit stops just a bit more challenging.  Really puts the pit crews in the race.  Whaever tey get paid...it ain't nearly enough. Speaking of which...the #8 team really kicked ass in the pits.  I watched some of the best practiced pit moves I have ever seen.  Also my hat's off to the front tire changer for the #15 team.  Really felt for that guy when he got the hose caught on the right front fender of the Napa Chevy.  What a recovery!  He didn't panic, just got it unhung and carried on.  Bet he was beating himself up until Mikey crossed the start finish on lap 400.  Best pit recovery I have seen in a while.  Well, I'll close the way I started.  Jimmie Johnson is a cheating bastard.  Bet there are 42 other teams rolling out of Charelotte right about now that would agree with me.  Especially a bunch of Rainbow Warriors.    Until next week, remember, it ain't racin unless you have to repaint the fenders.

      I think this e-mail forwarded from Mom about sums it up.....  Soldier's Letter to Kerry   Dear Senator Kerry:    Since it has become clear that you will probably be the Democratic nominee for President, I have spent a great deal of time researching your war record and your record as a professional politician. The reason is simple, you aspire to be the Commander in Chief who would lead my sons and their fellow soldiers in time of war. I simply wanted to know if you possess the necessary qualifications to be trusted in that respect.   You see, I belong to a family of proud U.S. veterans. I was a Captain in the Army Reserve, my father was a decorated Lieutenant in World War II; and I have four sons who have either served, or are currently serving in the military. The oldest is an Army Lieutenant still on active duty in Afghanistan after already being honored for his service in Iraq. The youngest is an E-4 with the military police. His National Guard unit just finished their second tour of active duty, including six months in Guantanamo Bay. My two other sons have served in the  national guard and the navy.   In looking at your record I found myself comparing it not only to that of my father and my sons, but to the people they served with. My father served with the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion in Europe. They landed on Utah Beach and fought for 317 straight days including the Cherbourg Peninsula, Aachen, the Hurtgen Forest, and the Battle of the Bulge. You earned a Silver Star in Vietnam for chasing down and finishing off a wounded and retreating enemy soldier. My father won a Bronze Star for single handedly charging and knocking out a German machine gun nest that had his men pinned down. You received three purple hearts for what appears to be three minor scratches. In fact you only missed a combined total of two days of duty for these wounds. The men of my father's unit, the 87th, had to be admonished by their commanding officer because: "It has been brought to our attention that some men are covering up wounds and refusing medical attention for fear of being evacuated and permanently separated from this organization..." It was also a common problem for seriously wounded soldiers to go AWOL from hospitals in order to rejoin their units.  You used your three purple hearts to leave Vietnam early.    My oldest boy came home from Iraq with numerous commendations and then proceeded to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and from there back to Iraq again. My sons and father have never had anything but the highest regard and respect for their fellow soldiers. Yet, you came home to publicly charge your fellow fighting men with being war criminals and to urge their defeat by the enemy. You even wrote a book that had a cover which mocked the heroism of the U.S. Marines who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. Our current crop of soldiers has a philosophy that no one gets left behind; and they have practiced that from Somalia to the battlefields of the Middle East. Yet as chairman of a Senate committee looking into allegations that many of your fellow servicemen had been left behind as prisoners in Vietnam, you chose to defend the brutal Vietnamese regime.You even went so far as to refer to the families of the POWs and MIAs as Professional malcontents, conspiracy mongers, con artists, and dime-store Rambos.   As a Senator you voted against the 1991 Gulf War, and have repeatedly voted against funds to supply our troops with the best equipment, and against money to improve our intelligence capability. I find this particularly ironic since as a Presidential candidate you are highly critical of our pre-war intelligence in Iraq. However, you did vote to authorize the President to go to war, but have since proceeded to do everything you can to undermine the efforts of our government and our troops to win. Is this what our fighting men and women can expect of you if you are their Commander in Chief? Will you gladly send them to war, only to then aid the enemy by undermining the morale of our troops and cutting off the weapons they need to win?  Our country is at war Senator, and as has been the case in every war since the American Revolution, a member of my family is serving their country during the war. Now you want me to trust you to lead my sons in this fight.   Sorry Senator, but when I compare your record to those who have fought and died for this nation, and are currently fighting and dying, the answer is not just no, but Hell No!   Sincerely,  Michael Connelly February 14, 2004 Dallas, Texas    Forward this to EVERYONE you know--we can NOT afford to have this man as the President of the United States!!

      Well Michael Moore has won a big award at Cannes.  Big fat hairy deal.  What this prooves to me though is just how easily people are mislead by our media.  Michael Moore is the best example of a stupid white man.  His "documentary" (and I do use that term lightly) Bowling for Columbine won an Oscar for best documentary.  If you look  urlLink here , you will find just how idiotic this guy is.  He is a blatant liar and has purposly mislead all those who view this piece of garbage.  There are several web sites out there which denounce Michael Moore's efforts to make a conspiracy theory out of thin air.  I think it humourous he has to lie to proove his point.    Well, I have wasted enough time on this POS today.  But it did help the coffee to get my blood pressure up this morning.

      LMAO!!  What a joke!   urlLink Kerry: Many U.S. Military Back Him as Their Commander   Personally, after surviving 8 years of my Navy career under Clintonism, I will get out of the Navy if this asshole becomes my commander-in-chief.  No one I talk to on the ship is willing to vote for him either.  After knowing Mr. Kerry's voting history in the Senate, I hate to think what he will do as CinC.  I'm betting he would dismantle the military all together.  Finish what Clinton started.  I cannot believe he even made that comment.

      The funny thing about this is it was an advertising link at the bottom of a New York Times.com column about Mikey Moore's new BS movie.  The last line of the article reads:  Yesterday, Mr. Moore called the complaint "a blatant attempt on the part of a right-wing, Republican-sponsored group to stop people from seeing my movie."   Someone does have a sense of humor and I love it.   urlLink RightWingConspiracy.org - Conservatives and Republicans Helping to Preserve America's Freedom.

      Ahh yes....shipboard life again.  Here is a typical day for ya:  I woke up to get some chow around 1700.  I am glad I did cause it was prime rib and crab legs night.  WOO HOOO!!  When I got done eating I went and grabbed a smoke and headed back down to berthing to grab a shower.  It was then I realized just how little we have progressed from the days of old sailing ships.  Let me explain.  In the days of old, when mother nature powered our navy, the very front of the ship was the bathroom....the head as we now call it.  In all acuality, it was little more than an outhouse.  Just a bench really for all your natural needs.  It was also the place the furthest up-wind on the ship since the wind (hopefully) blew from the rear of the ship.  Also, the bow of the ship would also get quite a bit of water splashed up into the head and wash all the piss and shit off the deck.  Today, I wished it would have been that simple.  I walked back down and I kid you not, the deck was COVERED in shit.  I am not joking when I say there were turds floating by.  I joked to one of the other guys in my best Steve Irwin voice, "Crikies, there goes a big brown shark, mate!"  I know it's sick.  Even now I am feeling nausous just thinking about the scene.  But damn, sometimes ya just gotta laugh and admit defeat to Mr. Murphy.  Acutally, in the Navy, it's Leagalman First Class (LN1) Murphy.  Been trying to kick that SOB outta the Navy for 15 years now.  Still can't.    Well, I did get a shower.  Amazing as it is, it's still a mess.  Literally.  I just find it ironic that the Navy would develop ships that can shoot a missile half way around the world and hit a camel carying some moron shouting death to america in the middle of the desert but we would be better off with outhouses on the front of our ships.    Guess I gotta realize I am not here for the accomidations but for knockin that camel jockey off.

      Well, it finally happened.  We left for deployment 3 days ago.  It's been rough.  I have been trying to keep my emotions in check and hopefully I can long enough to get some thoughts written here.  Forgive me if I cut this short.  So far I guess it's been pretty much as expected.  Saying good-bye was the hardest thing I have had to do in recent memory.  Seeing Chris and the kids on the pier was like an out of body experience.  It was as if I was seeing it happen but not believing it.  As hard as I tried not to, I cried like a bitch.  I guess what troubled me most was the fact that Andrew showed no emotion at all.  I know how emotinoal he gets and it kinda hurt that he seemed like he didnt care at all.  Not that I want him to be upset, but he nearly seemed relieved that I was leaving.  I had to give DR permission to cry the night before I left.  He really tried being tough but finally broke down after I told him it was ok to cry.    Laura was the surprise.  She broke down several times.  I think half of it was she saw how upset Chris was.  She's a card.  She was making motions about taking pictures of some sort.  I had to call Chris to find out what she meant.  She wants me to take pictures of dolphins at sea.  I have been keeping my camera up in the shop so I can keep my promise to get some picts of them as soon as I see them.  I went out the night before I left and got cards for the boy's birthdays and signed them.  Chris has them at home.  It hurts knowing I will miss thier birthdays, but I promised them I would make it up to them when I get back.  That sucks.  But, they understand.  Guess that's the best I can do.  Well, that's all I can do for right now.  Chris, I love you.  I think of you from the moment I wake up to the moment I lay my head head on my pillow and then I dream of the day I get back to you until I wake up again.  I miss you more than I can say.  Love ya, babe!

      God does this shit suck!!!!  Obviously, I can't say exactly where I am or what we are doing here but, I gotta say this....I am sick of it!  The temperature is well over 110 degrees every day.  The afternoons are the worst because the sun bakes the water and makes it really nice and humid....talking 90%.  Most of the mornings and early afternoon is cool because the wind blows at least a little bit, but then the wind stops and lemme tell you, it makes it un-friggin-bearable.  I work 12 hour shifts and then try to work on my ESWS.....rarely am I motivated enough to even open the book.  Just as I am getting off work, Chris is waking up.  But it seems Chris is too busy for me even latley.  So, I am ass out there too.  All in all, I am just fed up.  I am venting here cause I don't know who else to vent to.  I know Chris is busy and I feel bad for asking her to sit down and chat with me for even a few minutes.   All in all I guess I am just sitting here in this heat feeling really sorry for myself and forgotten in the asshole of the world.  I would call it the armpit but, armpits smell better than this place.  I would be happy to leave but pretty sure by then my family will have totally forgotten about me.   Why the hell do I want to do this for 5 more years?  What the fuck was going through my head believing I alone could somehow change the world and make a difference?  What made me think I had no other choice than to leave home for 6 months and dump everything on Chris.  I need to quit bitching and go to bed.  I know I'm gonna take shit over this but I just needed to get this off my chest.  Fuck it.  no one will probally read this anyway.
