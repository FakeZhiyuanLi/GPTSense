      23 June 2004. A news item that says research shows that a person with a cool head is less likely to get affected by high Blood Pressure. Now, this looks like circular logic. One of the symptoms of high BP is NOT having a cool head. Now, we have proof that people with a cool head have less risk of BP. Do you really need to spend money on research to arrive at this conclusion?   I would also like to spend the next few years on my research topic and prove that good looking people actually get more opportunities to play lead roles in movies than average looking people.  I will interview thousands of people and watch hundreds of movies over the next two years to prove this to you. I will be very thourough in my research to make sure it is conclusive!  I will surely interview the south african contestant who was told by Pooja Bhatt (a leading film producer from Bollywood) that she could not be a lead because she was too dark for Bollywood movies. I mean should someone not be cast because they are dark? Isnt talent enough? But then the question also arises - should someone not be allowed to sing because they have a voice like mine (if you had a choice of listening to me sing or listening to nails on a blackboard, guess what you would pick?) I mean my songs have great lyrics.   The debate on form or content goes on. Is form more important than content? Or having great content mean you dont need the form. Like Richard M Stallman or our president Abdul Kalam who dont need a jazzy suit to make them look good. They dont care but people will still respect them for what they have contributed. I mean even guys who dont like RMS' rants have to hand it to him for emacs and gcc (i hope i am right). Then there are guys like me who need to be comfortably coccooned in a suit, tie and neatly combed hair to make an impression that I am a smart person who can be trusted to manage a software project or software organization. To me it has always been form and content, but I have found people with lots more content than me who dont need to care about form.   But whatever be the case, at least on the Internet, content is king:-)

      I read two reports on income in India.   1. The total number of income tax assessees in India who have more than Rs. 10 lakhs as income is 71,000.   2. The total number of HNI (high networth individuals - they are no longer called millionaires you poor dumbo!) in India are 77,000. That is 77,000 people have more than Rs. 4.6 crores.   Nowsomething tells me that if someone has 4.6 crores, chances are pretty high that this person would be earning at least Rs. 10 lakhs per annum. I would be very pissed if I had that kind of money and did get at least a lakh every month. Remember that if I got a lakh, I would pay 30k as IT and would only have 70k to spend.   In my limited logic (I agree I did not do too well in maths in school and did not take it up in collese becos I was afraid of algebra and calculus. In fact, the only calculus I liked was professor Calculus in Tintin!). Oops I lost the thread again. As I was saying, in my limited logic there are at least 5 times as many people (closer to 350,000 people) who should be making more than Rs. 10 lakhs per annum. Maybe even more, but the IT dept thinks there are only 71,000 people. And I bet you a 1000 rupees that out of this 71,000 people more than 50,000 are salaried people in the top management of various companies.   Oh! I am sorry, I did not know that businessmen are exempted from paying tax. How dumb of me. Well, now that explains it all. I mean the country has to encourage business and agriculture which creates jobs for the people and therefore has decided that farmers and businessmen need not pay taxes!   I only wish we had more salaried people so that we could vote a govt into power that would also exempt salaried people from paying taxes. I am sure we will still be able to balance our budget. But, of course!

      An Indian UN Official has been accused of asking for bribes and sexually harrasing people. There is a saying in Hindi "yatha raja, thatha praja" meaning, "as is the king, so are the subjects". Kofi Annan awarded the "oil for food" (or 'oil for fraud' as is it known now) inspection contract to Cotecna a previous employer of his son and which had been implicated previously on bribery charges. And they in turn turned a blind eye (or collaborated) in perpetrating a large scale fraud on the iraqi people but siphoning the money in conjunction with people of many countries (talk about global brotherhood). I am sure Cotecna was chosen purely on merit Mr Annan and the fact that it employed your son in the past was just coincidence. But of course!   There is a lot of hullabaloo about all political parties suddenly becoming pro-poor. BJP is threatening to launch an agitation becos the UPA raised the price of petrol and gas. Now wait a minute, is this the party which wanted to privatize oil and markets to determine the prices? I am now totally confused.   I find that all the intellectuals (including psuedo ones like me) make being pro poor a big deal and try to explain why increasing the prices of oil and reducing subsidy is good for the country. I think they forget that we live in a democrazy(how aptly named!). Let me explain the difference between democrazy and autocracy.   Let us say I was a head of a family with my wife and 3 kids. In an autocracy, I would decide (if you promise not to let others know, my wife would) how to spend my salary and on essential and important items. But if our family was a democrazy, we would have to vote and since the children have more votes, we would end up spending all the earnings and savings buying expensive chocolates, a trip to disneyland and having a good time for the next one week. Of course we would starve later, but do the kids care about it and can they appreciate it. Maybe not. Same as ditto for the country.   If the majority choose to do something the minority cannot say it is wrong. For e.g. if all the farmers vote and (their reps) decide that all buildings in the city should be razed, then it is the wish and will of the majority and we cannot complain. Like they say, democrazy is not a great system, but it is the best we have. So, go ahead UPA, give sops to the poor. In fact, I am thinking, I should contest the elections next time and I will promise them not only free power, but also one free auto and free petrol (20 litres a month), free clothes, free 2 bedroom house (600 square feet), free gas cylinder (1 in a month), free bath soap, free deo (sorry I got carried away). Take the deo and the bath soap out.   Money is a funny thing. The law of economics means, there is no way everybody can be rich. Meaning, if everybody had a million dollars, then nobody would be rich. But everybody can be poor. Since equity is important, it is better to strive to make everybody poor rather than try and fail to make everybody rich. That was the basis of the ersthwile Soviet bloc and socialism.

      Today, 18th of June, Year 2004  Javed Miandad says he quit as the cricket coach of Pakistan and was not fired. Yeah, yeah, Javed, we believe you.  On another note, a large number of students of the coaching institutes from Hyderabad have got thru the entrance exam. "Admit your wards in IIT coaching academies only if they have genuine skills to make it to IIT. Do not pressurise them by making them join coaching institutes,‚Äù Ramaiah said." Yeah, Yeah Mr. Ramaiah, the barman was telling me how "daru badi gandhi cheez hai" (liquor is very bad for my health). Oh! I forgot to mention that the students in his institute have to get up at 4 AM everyday and have a cold water bath before getting into class and corporal punishment is deemed necessary to get into IIT.  I sometimes watch my son build a tower with blocks. They are so precariously arranged that I keep thinking, now...now..now. The tension is palpable as I try to predict when it will fall. That is how I feel when I hear about the UPA at the center. Mulayam.....now....Rahul....now....CPI....now....Cauvery....now. And the waiting game continues.

      A school burned down in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and 90 children lost their lives. The CM of TN anounced 50,000 Rs as compensation and Sonia Gandhi announced 1 crore from the PM fund. Jayalalithaji/Soniaji, can you tell me how can we compensate a father who has lost his daughter? I am sitting here 500 miles away and thoughts of the incident is sending shivers down my spine since I have a 4 yr old son.     How can a father be compensated for such a loss. Nothing/nobody can ever can bring solace but it would have been fitting if the Govt takes measures across India that such a plight will NEVER EVER befall another parent. Call it the Kumbakonam Statute and ensure that all schools in the country are safe in all aspects. Safety drills are a must for all schools. Start a debate on how this can be avoided in the future. That is what is really needed at this time.     We have to do something to ensure that the deaths of the innocent children havent been invain. The Govt should appoint a chief safety officer for all schools in a State who will be personally culpable for any incidents that arise out of poor fire safety or other types of safety procedures. The Chief Safety Officer for India will also be responsible for coming up with recommendations for safety in schools along with drills that are necessary for all schools. These drills should be carried out once a year and all teachers and school employees trained.     It might have been better if Soniaji had announced concrete stpes for ensuring that such a thing does not happen again. As a parent who sends his son to school, I would have appreciated that very much. If you are reading this posting, you can also help out. You can check out your child's school for safety measures. You can meet the school authorities and check if they plan to have safety drills. This can be a wakeup call for us.

      There was this neat contest by searchenterpriselinux.com editor who was fed up of guys insinuating that Linus stole his idea from someone. He started a I wrote linux liars club and set a 50$ firts prize for tall tales. If you are one of those poor souls who actually reads this blog you know by now, how good I am at tall tales! So here goes  -----------------------  It was a dark and rainy day on the 31st of July 1991 at the University of Helsinki. Linus Torvalds, student of computer science hurried into the rain, clutching his raincoat. "damn the 386" he muttered under his breadth. He had just bought a 386 and made the biggest mistake of his life showing off the computer to Professor Tannenbaum. Everyone told him that Prof. Minix (as everyone called him) was a real tyrant who loved to show off how tough it was to write an OS. And now the professor wanted to make Linus' life miserable and asked him to write a *monolithic* OS. Now, what the hell was a *monolothic OS*?  The only reason Linus had joined computer science at Helsinki was Tove, the lovely lady whom he had met at the Finnish Karate championship where he had gone to watch. Sparks flew between them and she told him she was a computer lab assitant working with Professor Tannenbaum (boy, how he hated the name). He promptly went to the admissions office and told them, he wanted to study under Professor Tannenbaum. They gave him a form which he filled out and his father was kind enough to pay up the fees. He was really expecting to be studying an easy subject like history or maybe anthropology. He was in for a shock when he suddenly realised that Professor Tannenbaum was professor in the computer science dept.  Linus was devastated. He thought about changing his courses and went back to the admissions office, but they said it was too late. He would have to forgo his tuition fees. He knew if he dropped out after paying so much money, his father would kill him. Nils Torvalds was known to be a communist and like all communist spies (so his friends said) should be well trained in Russian torture. And Nils always was proud of his visit to Moscow! Only God knew why he was allowed into Moscow and what he was doing at the Kremlin. In any case, Linus didn't want to find out about the Moscow trip by dropping out of college.  His room mate, a nice chap called Micheal D told him he could help him with the computer stuff but Linus would have to learn the science stuff himself. Micheal went out with Linus to the local store between the Kamppi & Ruoholahti metro stations. It had a small board outside called the "Micropirates". Linus was terrified as Micheal led him inside and asked for a 386 motherboard and a mouse (Linus hated mice as pets and wondered why Micheal wanted one and that too in a computer store). He also asked for other things and used some strange acronyms like CPU and PS2. Anyways, Micheal finally got all the stuff in a large bag and once they reached the dorm, Micheal started putting the whole thing together. Linus waited while Micheal was putting the computer together but it was getting late and he dozed off. In his dream Tove and he were alone in a computer lab and he was about the kiss her when he was rudely awoken by Micheal. He looked at his watch and it said, 2 AM. What on earth did Micheal want at that unearthly hour? Micheal was really excited and said "man, it really works? The computer works. I know what I's going to do. Put together computers for all your classmates. I will charge them much less than what IBM does. I will brand it as Micheal Computers" And all Linus could see was one line blinking on the screen.  Linus asked "well, where is the remote?" Micheal stared at him and said "For gods sake, this is a computer! You will have to use the keyboard". "Well, my tv looks much better. It has more than one stupid blinking line and it has a remote too." And Micheal sat the whole night showing Linus how to switch it on and play Doom.  Linus was really excited as he lugged the computer to show off to the Prof. The whole class was staring at him when he entered. Maybe they were jealous Linus thought. But he got the shock of his life when Professor asked him to write an OS (a monolithic one he reminded himself). He did what most people do when confronted with an insurmountable problem, he slept and decided he would think about it in the morning.  Micheal had come in pretty late that night and Linus woke him "Look here, I need help. I have to write an Operating System and Prof Minix will kill me if I don‚Äôt. Bill G my classmate tells me he is a communist. You have to do something." Micheal said "I can help you with the hardware stuff but I really don‚Äôt know much about the software. Why don‚Äôt you ask your friend Bill to help you out?" "I did. Bill refuses to show me his code. He said he will not show it to anybody, even the professor. And everyone in the class will have to pay 10 dollars. Even if they do not use it." "Wow, this Bill seems like a great character. I have to meet him. Linus, can you help me meet up with him. I will bundle his software and he can help sell my hardware." "Oh! Micheal, please. Let us not talk business now. My life is hanging by a thread and all you can think of is making money!" "Alright. I have an idea. Let us post a help message in USENET" "What the hell is Usenet? You sure this will help and you are not kidding me?" "Of course not, I would never do such a thing. Here let me help you post this in your name"          Message-ID: 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.helsinki.fi         From: torvalds@klaava.helsinki.fi (Linus Benedict Torvalds)         To: Newsgroups: comp.os.minix         Subject: Pls help me or (prof) minix will kill me!         Summary: some help for my new operating system          Hello everybody out there under minix-I'm have to do a (free)         operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional         like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones. This has been brewing since         april, and if not ready will lead to my death. I'd like         someone to help me write an OS so that it resembles minix.         And if someone dislikes prof minix, please break his leg or         something. I will do anything to have the OS written. Even willing         to pay 500 dollars for the OS.          Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)          Linus  "Done. Now lets hope someone hates minix enough to help you out" Linus woke up as usual at 11 AM and as he was sipping his morning tea, and reading his paper, his eye caught the article on outsourcing. There was a huge protest rally against outsourcing software programming to India. There were opinions from CEOs who claimed that Indian programmers were willing to work for 300 dollars a month! "wow" thought Linus  "if only I could hire an Indian programmer. 300 dollars to save my skin would be okay" Micheal came in right then and said "Lets check out if someone has responded".  "587 responses from Indian offshore companies who are willing to work for 8 dollars an hour. 234 responses from Russian companies and 18 from Cambodian and 2 from Srilanka" said Micheal. "But how do I pick the right one and how much time do you think it will take to write the OS. All I have is 500 dollars." moaned Linus. "Ah! Wait. Here is an interesting offer from a guy named Sriram Naranyanan. Indian programmer willing to outsource work at 500 dollars for the OS. Shall we go for it?" "Yes. But I will pay the money only after I see the goods"  And so it was, an obscure programmer called Sriram wrote the *monolothic* operating system christened Sriramux. Linus was really happy to get his assignment finally done. Now he could focus the rest of the semester on wooing Tove instead of slogging on a stupid Operating System. He wanted Micheal's help in getting the assignment to the professor. "How am I supposed to give this to Prof. Can I print it and give it to him?" "And how do you think will the prof run it on his computer? Feed it your printouts? Why don‚Äôt you put it up on FTP site and let him take it from there" said Micheal. "Well, we are almost done. I have created a directory called "linux" and uploaded all the files there. I also made sure the Prof will not suspect anything and replaced all Sriramux references with Linux. I wanted to use Linus but the x thing used by the developer seemed cool. Now you can trademark the name if you want to Linus. Ha! Ha! Ha!"

      The state govt should enter agriculture so that small/marginal farmers can be made govt employees. There will be a simple profit sharing mechanism between the employee and the govt. The govt will provide all inputs and share the profits. This way, if there is a loss, marginal farmers will not die of hunger. And if there is a good crop, the govt and farmer will earn a profit. There is also more incentive for the farmer to produce a profit. And of course there are other benefits like providing more govt employment to people who will administer this who scheme (distribution of inputs, marketing produce). The loss for the state will be maybe 2000 crores but if 2000 crores will solve one of the major problem in the state, I     think it is worth subsidising.  It will provide security to the small and marginal people in the state and can be used to also rehabilitate a lot of poor people into farming since they do not have lands of their own.  Of course, more power in the hands of the govt might mean more corruption but if run well with a decent 20-30% corruption, I think it will still achieve a lot. Sad, but if 1/3 of the money disappears, I am not at all disurbed.  Afterall, politicians who draw 1 rupee salary (most of our politicians do I think) also need to keep their home fires burning and it is another matter that they keep their home (India) burning.
