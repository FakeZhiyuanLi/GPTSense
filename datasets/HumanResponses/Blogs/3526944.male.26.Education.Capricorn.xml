						   Well, I just found out that the bill to fix my car to pass inspection will be $500. I hate living in a state that inspects cars. Plus, I drive a pretty nice car, and I see beaters driving all over my neighborhood that pass inspection without problem...makes me wonder if I'm being held to a higher standard because I drive a newer car...if they think I have the money, their terribly mistaken.

						   So, short entry today, mainly because I'm too impatient to sit and write. So, what happened today? Here's a quick recap: Got pulled over and had to take my car to get an inspection Found out that you can't have any secrets in my family, and everyone knows I'm coming home Venus passed through the Earths line of sight with the sun (cool) Thousands of people continued to mourn Ronald Reagan's death.  To commemmorate the last one, here are some Ronald Reagan quotes you may not see in the tribute articles about our 40th president:  "I am not worried about the deficit. It is big enough to take care of itself."  "Facts are stupid things." –at the 1988 Republican National Convention, attempting to quote John Adams, who said, "Facts are stubborn things"  "Trees cause more pollution than automobiles."  "Politics is supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."  We'll miss you Ronnie...not as a president, but as a constant source of entertainment.  And on that note, here's my quote for the day (well, week since I'll be gone for a little while): "Politics is just like show business. You have a hell of an opening, you coast for awhile, you have a hell of a closing." ~ Ronald Reagan

						   Well, I find myself in quite a predicament. Here's a recap of my love life over the past year. I've fallen in love with two women. One is 700 miles away, and the other is in a long term relationship. I've been out on a date with a very strange woman, and I've been shot down by a waitress. That has pretty much been the activity...until two weekends ago. That weekend I went to the shore and ended up hooking up with a woman that works in a different area of my company. She's nice, but I'm not sure if she's someone I could co-exist with in a relationship. We spent the night together (no sex) and she left the next day. I knew she was interested in me, and I knew it was against my better judgement to mess around with her, but I did it anyway...DOH!  So, last week, when I returned to the office, I got what I expected, an email from her asking me out. I accepcted, a bit skeptical, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Maybe we would hit it off. We had a good time, and got a little "tipsy" and headed to my place. We originally went to my place because she couldn't drive home, and my apartment was within walking distance. I had no intention of having her over, but, what the hell? So, needless to say, she stayed over, we messed around again, and she left in the morning. She was busy all weekend, so I had a chance to think about what happened, and if I wanted to pursue anything with her. I keep coming back to the fact that 1.) I don't really think anything could happen between us, and 2.) I really am in love with someone else. I have to be honest with her, and let her know that I'm not interested in continuing. I know she's looking for more, and I'm not, so it would be irresponsible of me to let it continue. Someone will get hurt (her), and it's better to nip it in the bud before things get serious.  On a lighter note, good sports weekend for me. Pistons won...and as I sign off for today, I leave you with the age old saying, "Offense wins games, defense wins championships." Go Pistons!

						   I've been thinking about the future lately, and I've been kicking around the idea of leaving my job after next year and starting law school. The thing is, I've always been indecisive about my professional life, even as a college student. I remember the time I wanted to be a sports medicine major, but since I made the decision kind of late in my college career, and the classes I had to take for the major were sequential, I was facing another 4 + years of college. I didn't think it was fair for an junior to have to take the classes sequentially, and I met with the dean to plead my case for taking the classes during the same semester. When he asked why I thought it was unfair,  I told him that I had spent my first two years of college trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and I had come to the conclusion that sports medicice was it, and I didn't feel like I should have been punished for it. He then said something that has popped into my mind every time I think of changing direction in my life. After I pled my case he said, "It's not my fault that you're indecisive." And that was the end of it. He didn't budge, and I got pissed. I thought, "Screw him! He doesn't know anything about me, other than I've changed majors a few times." But, now that I look back on it, I have been indecisive, until I entered the profession I'm in now. Since I started doing the work I'm doing, I've felt like I have purpose. I've worked very hard, and I've made some tough decisions. I have been anything but indecisive. But, now that I'm thinking of making a transition back to school, I'm scared that it will turn into the "sports medicine" thing all over again. I originally started this job with the intention of staying for three years, then moving on. Now, I'm starting to feel like three years is one year too many. I'm thinking that it may be time for me to venture out and start preparing for a career that will take me further than a low paying student affairs position at a private college. I'm 26, and I want to start preparing for my future. It's scary, but I'm growing up.  I've also been thinking a lot of returning to Michigan. I miss my family and friends, and it has taken a long time for me to get comfortable here, let alone be happy. I know the fact that I miss my family is playing a part in my decision to return a year early, but I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. Family has always been very important to me, and I don't want to become so detached from them that I become one of their "distant relatives." I think it's time to sit down and do some serious "pros and cons" thinking, and determine what's best for me. Hopefully I can come to a conclusion that is good for everyone involved, and I can work very hard this year to ensure I will be leaving a legacy, regardless of when I choose to leave.  Until next time...Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. ~ George Bernard Shaw

						   Well, here I am, trying this thing called blogging.  I can't promise it will be updated often.  I can't promise what I write will be interesting, but I can promise it will be in english...  I'm doing this for me, but I may let a few people in on the joke. I'm doing this because I want to look back at my thoughts three months from now and laugh at myself. I want to laugh at what I thought was important. Laugh at what I stressed about. That's what the title of my blog means. I can look back at this weekend and think, "Man, I really shouldn't have had that much to drink," (which is very true, by the way)but at the time it was a perfectly good idea to drink half a bottle of whiskey and a few beers to wash it down. We can all second guess ourselves, and the reality is, if we don't make the same mistake twice, we'll make a different one instead.  So, I want to write my goods, bads, and uglies down, for me to look back on and laugh, and maybe even help me avoid doing the same thing twice.  A friend of mine included in her blog a song by Jamie Cullum called "Twentysomething." It was a simple, yet insightful song that pretty much sums up where I'm at in my life right now.  And, since I'm a Twentysomething myself, I thought it was appropriate to include it in my first blog.  This is me...  ---- TWENTYSOMETHING After years of expensive education A car full of books and anticipation I’m an expert on Shakespeare and that’s a hell of a lot But the world don’t need scholars as much as I thought Maybe I’ll go travelling for a year Finding myself, or start a career Could work the poor, though I’m hungry for fame We all seem so different but we’re just the same Maybe I’ll go to the gym, so I don’t get fat Aren’t things more easy, with a tight six pack Who knows the answers, who do you trust I can’t even seperate love from lust Maybe I’ll move back home and pay off my loans Working nine to five, answering phones But don’t make me live for Friday nights Drinking eight pints and getting in fights Maybe I’ll just fall in love That could solve it all Philosophers say that that’s enough There surely must be more Love ain’t the answer, nor is work The truth elludes me so much it hurts But I’m still having fun and I guess that’s the key I’m a twentysomething and I’ll keep being me  ---  I know that falling in love is not the answer, but sometimes I hope it will be.  I know that work isn't the answer, but sometimes I make it my answer.  Life has been funny over the past couple years.  I've lost people I loved, lost my sweetheart, and left my support system for a place that was completely unknown for me.  I've gotten drunk, been stone cold sober, and laughed with new friends in new places.  I've lost touch with people I thought I'd be close to forever, and I've met new people that I now think I'll be close to forever.  I've been kissed by a few women, none giving me the feeling I miss, and I've kissed a few women who I didn't give the feeling they missed.  I've  gotten in way over my head with a job, and sometimes feel like I'm tricking people into believing I'm doing well.  Other times, I feel like I can do no wrong.  My head is full of these contradictions, as I'm sure everyone else's is.  If you're reading this, I'm sure some will sound familiar...it's the common experiences that make us human.    So comes to a close my first blog of many (or few).  Until next time...I'm still having fun and I guess that's the key.
