       Parent/Teacher get-together...  I'll be meeting with the boys' teachers at school tomorrow. You know, the 'parent/teacher' thing! Gees - that makes me sound so old - hahaha! But it's always good to see firsthand how they're going in their school environment. It's a nice small school (like only 30/35 kids in total), and I know they're in a really great positive environment and being thoughtfully cared for - you know what I mean. I'm really looking forward to it.
 
  Mum...  My brother rang the other day, and we'll be going together to spend the day with mum, hopefully this Thursday. One of the benefits of all of this is that my bro and I spend like 3 or 4 hours in the car alone together, just talking talking talking! It's so wonderful! Like a breath of fresh air into my tired soul. So hopefully, mum'll be upto seeing the both of us. She misses us, of course, but she seems so weak at the moment... 
 
  Builders...  I've spent the last year watching and listening to a local building co. attempt to construct about 7 townhouses, right along our back fence. Actually, right outside my bedroom window. Thank gawd they've finished now, but for a few months now the sounds of hammers and trucks beeping as they reversed - at like  6am!!!  - was quite a pain in the butt. Listening to them consistently botch things up was a running laugh during the entire process, hanging over the back fence having a sticky-beak. Watching some of the 'creative' construction techniques was an eye-opener. Needless to say, my flatmate and I have our own challenge - whenever we see someone walking up to look at one of them to rent it, we're to yell out,  "Don't do it! It'll fall down in 6 months! Don't do it!"  lol The place I'm living in was built by the same co. about 3 years ago, and is roughly the same design etc. Well, the amount of cracks on the walls, bad-fitting doors and bizarre plumbing in just that amount of short time leave me wondering how sturdy the places out the back really are! Oh yeah - if I jump up and down on the concrete slab on the back porch (which you do, of course! lol), the whole bleedin' lot moves! Gees! It's not as though this place is gonna fall down, I mean, it's only three years' old. But the closer we look at little things in the footings and in corners... sheesh! Talk about Bodgey builders! hahaha.  
 
  Bloomin...  It's amazing - some flowers I planted back towards the end of March are not only flourishing, but blossoming to boot! Now, you're talking to a notorious plastic-plant killer here! They're in three rectangular planters, and I have to keep moving them around the back patch of yard - to catch the short rays of the winter sun!

      My flatmate is the sports editor for the local paper, and she's found a few items close to home as a good sources for a small column called  'Parade - The Lighter Side'  in the daily newspaper... it makes me laugh that my clutziness can make the papers quite anonymously!
  Mince decor...  The supposedly simple task of cooking rissoles turned out to be a major operation for one budding Bathurst chef this week. He avoided the usual hurdle of setting off the smoke alarms, but that was almost as much success as he found. Mince ended up all over the kitchen following what he described as "an explosion" and to make matters worse the spoon he was using just happened to fall on the floor, adding an extra dimension to the new "mince decor". However, like any good cook, the menacing mince was cleaned up afterwards and the meal (as of yet) has not claimed any victims. 
 
  Sea sick!...  Being an inland city, one of the last afflictions one could expect to suffer in Bathurst would be sea sickness. However, this was the case for one Bathurst resident as he started to feel queasy when sitting at home watching old sailing videos. Filmed by an amateur, the vision conveyed that rolling feeling one gets while on the water. After discovering that the sick feeling was not merely hunger pains but sea sickness, the Bathurst resident, a former sailor, could only laugh at himself. 
 
  Wedding song?...   (I wonder who's sons these could be...? lol)  Three brothers were heard on Saturday singing was obviously their new favourite song - "Here comes the bride, all dressed in slime". The youngest of the three suggested that maybe they sing it to their mother when she gets married, but the older showed a wise head as he retorted: "Oh no, you would be in so much trouble if you did that." 
 
 Here's a story (that is  not  me, alright?! lol) from a recent Parade...  Loser...  As a female shopper exited the Campbelltown K-Mart in Queen Street, a man grabbed her purse and ran. A shop assistant at K-Mart called the police immediately and the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police had apprehended the snatcher, trying to mingle in the shopping crowd on Queen Street. They put him in the car and drove back to K-Mart. The thief was then taken out of the car and up to the K-Mart front desk and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied: "Yes, officer, that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from."

       Mum... 
Mum, who's in her mid-70's, is still not going so well. She's lost a whole lot of weight over the past 12 months, and now her energy levels have fallen to almost zip. In all seriousness, I'm not sure if she's got the emotional stamina to last until this Xmas! It's not as though she's had a bad trot... dad died 8 years ago, and she's had a wonderful life since then, full of life and energy. I guess that's whats so hard to see - her loss of strength. I mean, she's not even strong enough at the moment to go to the shops! My brother drives past her place twice a day to-and-from work, so he's keeping an eye on things with her. He's a medical person, so he can keep me informed what's really going on for her healthwise, apart from all the jargon.
 
  My brother... 
My brother and I are finally reconciled - after about two or so years. We've both been thru a ruff trot, but now the past is in the past, forgiven and forgotten. He's my only brother, and I don't want him out of my life anymore! Thankfully, we've been having a wonderful time just hanging out together recently, which is something we haven't really made the opportunity for us to do. It's a really positive vibe for me, to be friends with my bro again - you have no idea what a sense of  relief  it is for me.  
 
  Michelle's engagement... 
Michelle and her b/f announced their engagement last month. I'm actually very happy for her. The boys love him, so that's just fantastic.  My philosophy  about it all is: happy mum = happy boys. So, if Michelle's happy in her life choices, and it's a positive for the boys, then there's no reason why I can not be happy for them all. Good luck to them, really! The weddings' taking place in September. They boys are going pretty good, apart from winter cods, they're basically pretty happy. School seems to be a positive experience for them, and it's still a buzz for me to see them getting into the school bus to get home! They seem so grown up - Alex is 5 1/2 already! 
 
  Laffs... 
Listening to the radio has been a bonus lately. I must be getting old, when you start willingly to listen to ABC Radio National! But seriously, they're playing my 2 favourite British comedies,  The Goon Show  and  Hancock's Half Hour.  Of course, it's on at a ridiculous hour of the morning (5.30 in the bleedin' am!), so I set the alarm and tape 'em. Yeah, the shows that've been on recently have been ones I've already got on tape - from years' ago! aint it always the way?! lol  But some of the Tony Hancock stuff I haven't heard before (I've only heard about those episodes), so that's been wonderful. 
 
  Sleep... 
You know, sleep is one of those things you don't realise how much you need until you start missing out on it. I haven't been sleeping well at all over the last few weeks. Actually, I've been up all hours, and not getting out of bed until like after 10am! D'oh! I've felt tired, but not sleepy - does that makes sense? Not sleepy enough to sleep. Plus I hate just laying in bed tossing and turning trying to fall asleep - blech! I'd rather get up and read a book or something than just lay there. And it's not as thought the brain is going into overdrive in the quiet hours either (unlike it used to when I was first separated!) Nah, it's not as though I'm wrapped up in thoughts or philosophical considerations at 2am or anything like that - gawd forbid! Just wish I could feel sleepy when I was tired! Oh well... the joys of it all!  
 
   Birthday... 
I'll be turning the big four-oh in three weeks' time. You know, as a youngster, I never had a mental concept of what being 40 would be like! So, this'll be really uncharted territory (no pun intended!) for me emotionally and psychologically. I know I'm not 25 anymore (D'oh!), but I don't really feel 40... I dunno how to describe it anyway. That's OK... I'm fine with it, really. Physically, I'm starting to slow down a bit, and things and little bits of me aren't cooperating as much as they once did, but in the main I'm going pretty well, really. No major health problems, just the old brain is a bit tired!

       Gosh! It's cold!... 
It's  3c degrees  at the moment (about 37f) - my hands are cold - fingers feel too cold to type properly! This is the first time I've felt cold living here this winter! Time to dig out the ugh boots again - the world-famous ugh-boots held together with  gaffa tape!  I mean, I'm sitting here with my old Manly beanie (poor Manly! Sob! lol), so at least me old ears are warm enuff.
 
 Thoon... 
The funny side of it is - Thoon, my dancin' goldfish - his water is almost as cold! I dunno what to do about it - no wonder he's been dancing so much lately... just to try and keep warm!
Some ppl wonder what on earth prompted me to name him 'Thoon'... well, if you haven't found out the link on my webpages yet, here it is...  urlLink this will tell you  - or perhaps it won't! pmsl! 
 
 Chat friends... 
Since my puter is working, that is, I can get back online again, I've been able to catch up with my online chat friends. I haven't been able to talk with them for about 3+ months! Sob! But lately, I've caught up with friends in England, Sweeden, Greece, Turkey and Hawaii, as well as Australia. It's been wonderful. I've really missed being able to do that. 
 
 Hydra... 
I've found a new site on my  favourite  Greek island of Hydra, with some very beautiful pictures.  urlLink Take a look , click on the 'Hydra' link on the left, and you'll understand why I'm still fascinated with the place! 
 
 George Johnston... 
Speaking of Hydra, I did a search of some of the Johnston books I've got, and the ones I'm still after. They are quoting a price of $20+ for the same first-edition copy of  'My Brother Jack'  that I brought recently for just $8! Whoo hoo!

For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, my name is Maljam or Malster (that's my webname-nickname anyway), tho a very close friend calls me the  'Mallard'  - a wild flying duck! Whoo hoo! I'm living in the Central West of NSW Australia, divorced, 40, with three wonderful sons. I'm trying to be a full-time University student...!

Also watched 'The Gift" today (the flatmate's DVD collection is getting a bit of a workout)... good film, well shot etc. I don't usually like these sorta films, but this one's pretty good. Also saw "Rob Roy" which was about a 2 out of 5. Beautifully shot, and that's about the best part of it!!!

This time, I have found and ordered the last three out-of-print books by my favourite author that I do not have! By the end of this week I will have  every one  of his books that I have wanted - and for a whole lot less than I imagined!!! Whoo hoo! One of them is even  signed  by the guy! OK OK... this should be the end of my fascination with getting his old books for myself - there's no more to get! lol I've actually listed them all on a new page on my website.

I took the  boys  out for lunch, and Alex wanted to come home with me (sob!). It was great to be with them - as always. I had a nap this arvo, and had a very realistic dream of sailing with my dad (which we did for years when I was a young teenager etc). I awoke with tears streaming down my face! It's amazing, isn't it? After over 8 years, I still really miss him. A plus was that my final  George Johnston  book arrived, " The Darkness Outside " - that's the one I was waiting for! Whoo hoo! And finally... I also received " The Fisher King " on video - one of those quirky films that i absolutely love - can't describe it, just know that I love the whole feel of it. Did I spend the day/arvo/evening on the turps? Nope, didn't touch a drop - didn't feel like it! It's fucking horrible being alone on your birthday - even my flatmate left this morning to spend the w/end with her folks down the coast! So, home alone! lol. Oh well, life is... interesting! At least I can play my XTC, Rolling Stones and Beatles CD's bleedin' loud! Listening to "Please Please Me" even as I speak - gees, that's even older than I am - only just! pmsl!

      I just remembered why I hated Yahoo so much. Normally I have it sitting on whenever I'm online, in case a friend comes on and we can have a quick chat.  But,  when absolute strangers keep asking you for ur asl, then take like 5 minutes to reply, and say nothing intelligent at all too... grrr! Either talk to one person at a time, or don't bug me, baby! I can just imagine these poor twits with a screen full of PM windows, and none of them have ppl they know, and they're trying to talk to them all! Oh well... at least u can block the idjuts!

       I've found this great free site which
 hosts all your pics and gifs for your website. It's not like a public
 'photo gallery' or anything like that, but rather like a site to store your images and link
 them from this remote server. It's gonna save a lot of space in my
 normal webpage server, and the images will load a whole lot faster as
 well! It took a few hours to do it all properly, but I've done it the one and only time I'll ever have to do it!  Whoo hoo!

        Brrrr... 
 I checked the thermometer inside just a little while ago - and it was
 only 11c / 51f inside! No wonder I was feeling a bit chilly. Then I
 hear on the radio that it's snowing about 40km away from here, on the
 higher ground! Just as well it isn't really windy, otherwise it'd be  really  cold. I wasn't aware how
 chilly it actually was... I'd rugged up pretty well this morning, with
 lotsa layers on... it was only when I was having something to eat, and
 I noticed the steam coming with my breath... pmsl! But I love living
 around here - such a beautiful place to be part of.

  
   Royal
 Troon...  
 what were they thinking, naming a golf course 'Troon'?!? Everytime I
 hear them mention it on the radio news, I can't help but smile. I
 thought it was bad enuff having a goldfish called 'Thoon'! pmsl!

            Catching up.. .  I caught 
  up with a local family this evening. I stayed with them when I was 
  first separated, and house-sat their place over one Xmas holidays too. 
  I haven't seen many of my old church associates since moving back here, 
  but I thought it was about time to catch up with these people at least. 
  They're a few of the good ones. They invited me over for dinner, after 
  we'd been swapping a few email messages lately. It was a really good, 
  relaxed, low-key friendly fun evening of just hanging out together, 
  talking refreshingly. I felt really comfortable - it was a big positive 
  for me. Obviously, I haven't been doing enough of this kinda thing 
  lately, so it was good for me to 'break the ice' for myself to start 
  catching up with these people again, after such a long time.

          Message Board ...  I've been
continually tweaking my
website over the past month, and I think I'm finally happy with it!
(pmsl!) I haven't really been able to do anything with it for about the
last six months, because my computer was too sick to upload the stuff!
Plus, I've also opened a new Message Board for people to post their
comments and thoughts about life, the universe, everything - and a
banana. A group of people used to have one running when we all used to
have a online chat community a few years' ago, but most of those people
have moved on by now, and we don't use it anymore the way it used to
be. So, I opened a new one and streamlined it after my experience from
running the old one. Feel free to use it anytime. It's free to use, and you don't even need to log in or join! I don't know how it will be used at this stage, but it's there to be used. Cruise by and take a
look.  urlLink http://malboard.cjb.net  

   Webpages... 
speaking of  urlLink my website , I've added
a few new pages here and
there, and there's a few new additions to the photo gallery too. 

   CD's...  I was able to buy some
classic CD's today for very little
bucks. Right now I'm listening to an album I spent my school Year-12
listening to, Midnight Oil's "10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1" - I finally own a
copy! Plus, I got an early live Elvis set - like the really good stuff,
Sun-era R&amp;B and rockabilly stuff. And finally I got Bob Dylan and
The Grateful Dead - which was really cheap - and after listening to it,
I understand why! It's terrible! Sounds like really sloppy club muzak!
pmsl! While I was downtown, I ordered 2 CD's I'd been after for a long
time. I've got them on vinyl, but I've got no record player, so it's a
bit pointless! So, I'm awaiting The Rolling Stones' "Get Yer Ya-Ya's
Out" (an amazing live album from their 1969 American tour - great
guitar interplay - really!), and XTC's "Black Sea" - an album full of
great tunes with a great vibe to it. 

   Books...  whilst I sent away for the
four out-of-print books yesterday,
I managed to pick-up a Gary Larson/The Far Side book I hadn't seen
before. I thought I already had most of his stuff, but this was some
later stuff. Always good for a laff is the ol' Larson - he's a sick
puppy! Anyway, hopefully by the end of next week I should have in my
possession those 4 books... 3 by George Johnston and 1 by Robert Lowell
(a poet!). 

  You know you're getting old when you get excited when you find and buy a cheap  back scratcher  !!!  
   Camera...  I'm
disappointed by the loss of my small digital camera. A
few years ago we sent a video of Pa falling off a skateboard to
'Australia's Funniest Home Video Show', and in those days they gave
everyone who sent a video in a free small digital camera! While it only
took small low resolution pics, it was still bloody handy to have. Alas
and alack, it seems to have grown legs somehow. I've been looking high
and low for it over the last 6+ months. I know Michelle and the boys
don't have it. I fear I've accidentally left it somewhere (it was only
a
small thing), and someone's walked off with it. Bummer. I went pricing
a similar digital camera today, and I couldn't find anything within
cooee of it! They all started at like $300! I don't wanna spend money
like that on a camera at this stage!

      Have you seen this classic film,  "The Party" ? I sure hope so... it's got some of the most  classic scenes  in it that you'll remember  forever!   Peter Sellers  is in absolutely fine form here. Go see it this week! Do yourself a favour!

      Wow... we've had like 1/2 inch of rain over this weekend! Wonderful. Not good to get the washing dry, but that's just irrelevant. Fingers' crossed, the water'll run-off into the dam catchment, rather than just soak in. But, everything's so parched out here anyway - I doubt it.

        It's
raining! ... It's great - it's been raining constantly for about
the last 12 hours! Hey, we haven't had rain like that in about 2 months
here. Plus we're in the grip of our third year of a severe drought here
as well. So, any constant rain - that does more than just soak straight
into the parched ground - is really welcome. I'm lucky where I live,
about 200km from the coast. A few years' ago they raised the level of
the dam wall of the local water supply, and it's still got lots of
water in it. Unlike some of the other areas not far from here, which'll
have to start bringing water in for their town! It's pretty bad here in
Australia. I heard the other day that the drought started a few years
ago in Western Australia, and over the last 2 or 3 years it's crept
across over the continent to the Eastern states, where I am. So, it's
everywhere (well, except for a few places on the coast, of course). The
majority of our population live within c.1 hour of the coast, so a lot
of them don't really give a toss about the rest of us living out here,
west of what they call "The Sandstone Curtain"! lol 
  George
Johnston...  I've been able to locate three very rare
out-of-print books online in Australia of my favourite Australian
author, George Johnston. I've never used eBay or anything like that
before, but this is dealing with the booksellers direct, thru their
shops. I found them thru this site  urlLink here . It's great - I love his stuff,
but it's not as tho I'm an avid "1st-Edition collector", or anything
like that!  (Actually, I managed to
get a first-edition copy of his 1964's "My Brother Jack" for just $8 a
few months ago! Whoo hoo!)  I just wanted a copy of three of his
books I haven't got! I've read them before (borrowed them from various
local libraries over the years), but it'd be great to actually own them
and read them at will from now on! Plus - it won't cost me an arm and a
leg either - all up for all three, including postage, will be approx.
$36 / 21 EUR / $26 USD! I'm happy. 
  Thoon... 
Did you know that Thoon, my beloved goldfish, has his very own webpage
now? Check it out  here ! Thoon is enjoying his dancing
swimmy life in his new home. All is well with him - he's eating like me
(uh oh!), and enjoys exploring every fractional-inch of his little
world. 
  Online
for almost 5 years...  I couldn't believe it when I realised the
other day that I've had a 'presence' in cyberspace for almost 5 years
now! I uploaded my very first attempt at a website in August 1999! I
kept fiddling with that site for ages, after much trial and error. My
current site is a wholly new one from that one, but the history is
definitely linked between the two. It's not as tho I know anything
especially about designing webpages, it's all just trial-and-error
learning using different html programs, and fiddling with codes and
stuff! Sheesh!  
 
Plus - I've had  online friends 
for over 2 1/2 years now! I keep in regular touch with friends via chat
and email all over the world, including Hawaii, USA, England, Sweden,
Greece, Turkey, as well as all over Australia! Wow - a lot of water has
flowed under the bridge during that time of sharing together, let me
tell you! 
  Stink
pretty...  I must be reverting into my old hippy phase again, or
something  (gawd... somebody stop me!) 
I'm giving the ol' incense and oil-burner a good workout lately. Smells
nice anyway...

        Bowling... 
I took my three wonderful, handsome boys ten-pin bowling this arvo. Wow
- did we ever have a blast of fun! They had the disco lights and UV
lights and music pumping out - it was very cool! We were too busy
dancing to bowl sometimes! We played two games together, and even Alex,
the youngest, won the first game! It's amazing what those ramps and
gutter-stoppers can do for your confidence! They all looked so great
and grown up. It's been about 2 weeks' since I've seen them - that's
just the way things have worked out just lately. Josh is growing up
fast too - he's 11 in August - and he's got his first pimply-spots
already! Or perhaps it's just been a bit too much junk over the school
holidays - what do ya reckon? hahahaa. I caught him out of the corner
of my eye chatting with a girl while he was there trying to select a
ball - no wonder he took so long, the little flirt! Aint it cute?! And
sheesh - it got mighty warm in there! It was a bit cool outside today -
not too bad. But you still rug-up for it, and we all had to slip off
jumpers as we all got a sweat up... maybe it was all that running
around, dancing and bowling...? hahahaa 
It's just so good to hang out with the boys. Alex hugged and cuddled me
for ages. Of course they love and adore their 'new' dad too (which is
fine, by the way), but they still see themselves having two dads, which
is pretty cool for them. Oh yeah. 
When my brother visited with them the other day, they made sure he
stayed for dinner, and crawled all over him delightfully. It's just so
great to see they adore their 'Uncle David' - and he laps it all up, of
course, as any proud Uncle would. Good on him. I love my brother, and
it's just brilliant that the boys can still have an ongoing
relationship with my family too (and their 'Nanna Rae' - my mum). Whoo
hoo. It's making the best out of an unfortunate situation, with divorce
and all. Things are going good for the boys and their interfamily
relationships, which is such a huge relief off my shoulders.

       Mum and Bro...  My brother
picked me up yesterday, and we spent the day hanging out with our mum.
She's still very weary and thing, weak and quite breathless too. She
turns 75 in August. In spite of her weakness, we all had a wonderful
day together at her place in the Blue Mountains - lots of fun and
laffs. My brother and I had just the best time hanging out together in
the car (he drove me home again afterwards - a 1 1/2 hours drive back),
and we talked and laughed and compared notes for ages and ages -
wonderful time. After dropping me off, he dropped into visit the boys.
He's quite wrapped on Alex - he's a famous Uncle now! 
  Scanner
and keyboard.. . My brother gave me his old scanner yesterday as
well! Wow! It took all of 5 minutes to set up, and it scans just great!
Needless to say, I've updated a few photos and things on my website as
a result! Plus, for my birthday, I lashed out and bought a new keyboard
for this thing. I was sick of wrestling with a sticky 'l' key and a
down arrow key too. At last - this one's nice and touch-sensitive,
unlike the last one (an old 2nd-hand thing) which was a real clunker! 
  Photos
updated ... You can check out my new uploaded pics  thru my website . Latest ones of the
boys. Don't forget to sign my guestbook too! 
  CD... 
I also bought another CD (aahhh... the joys of birthdays!). I grabbed
an undamaged 2nd-hand copy of Crowded House - "Together Alone" - it's
the only one of theirs I didn't have. Sounds great! The Crowdies are
one of my favs. 
  Sleeting... 
another freezing day out here. It's about 1 point off sleeting - the
rain is really cold and 'hard' (if you know what I mean, if you've ever
lived in areas where it sleets and snows!) It'd be snowing where I used
to live in Ilford/Mt Vincent, about 70kms away! But, that's like 1,000
meters up atop a mountain, and I'm only like 670 meters up here. But,
as always, once you rug-up for it, it's not too bad at all. The dark
heavy clouds are rather really beautiful, in their own way. It's just
that  wind ... goes right thru
you! Sheesh!

       Thoon IV...  Well, "Thoon IV" my
comet goldfishy has established himself into his little waterworld in
my room happily enuff. He's a little larger than the last one (just the
luck of the draw - there was like 5 thousand in the tank at the shop!),
but dances happily just like his predecessor did. It's nice having a
fishie again - I left the filter and air pump on yesterday even tho the
thank was empty - force of habit! D'oh! So, I'll be nursing this one
for many years to come - fingers' crossed. It seems as tho I've finally
figured out the mistakes I've been making along the way - hopefully by
now I'll get it right! lol.
  Greece.. .
who would have believed it? Greece won the Euro 2000 Cup Soccer? They went into the competition totally ranked at 150 to 1 extreme outsiders - and they went all the way and won it, beating Portugal 1-0! Whoo hoo! It's the first international final Greece has ever won in soccer, apparently. All the Greeks here in Australia have declared an unofficial public holiday to celebrate! (Melbourne is the 3rd-largest Greek city in the world! True!) The Greeks in Sydney stopped the traffic in their wild celebrations!
  Manly... 
Well, at least the Greeks have got it good... my old team in the ARL,
Manly, are now coming dead  last!  D'oh!
Oh well... things'll bound to work out for them - eventually!

       Thoon...  
I have some very very sad news to share. My beloved goldfish, " Thoon  (III)" - has passed away! He'd
experienced a nasstie fishie disease, and did not respond at all to the
medical treatment. Sadly to say, his final swim was the big flush!
Well, he lasted longer than the first two - #1 lasted a week, and #2
jumped out of the bowl on the first night! #3 loved his new tank - with
a lid - for the last 8 months! 
 
However - "Thoon (IV)" will grace the tank tomorrow! lol Fingers'
crossed for this one... perhaps I should use water in the tank instead
of ouzo...? 
 
Gees... at least my flowers are still alive! lol 
  Cricket...  
 
So much for sitting back and enjoying 5 days of good cricket - it's all
over in 2 1/2 days! Sheesh! At least the Aussies won.

       CD's... 
 
 Here's a list of CD's I play endlessly! They're not in any particular order
either. Looking at it, it's funny that I've got so many 'Best Of' ones,
but that's a good place to start. I'd love some more early Stones, The
Who, plus XTC - and The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds'! Am I an old geeser?
You betya - and proud of it! pmsl! There's many a day or night when I'm
sitting at this damn desk typing away, with one of these oozing out of
my CD player here... either thru the air, or thru some groovy (lol)
headphones - I don't wanna keep my flatmate awake forever listening to
all my 'classical music'! lol 
Even as I'm writing this, I'm listening to Bob Dylan's 'Blonde on
Blonde' - for like the umteen-millionth time. I can never get weary of
the sound of this thing!

       Take a look at my webpages. I've spent a bit of time totally refreshing and updating them lately. There's  all  sorts of stuff in there, if you take a good look around! Enjoy. 

  Parent-Teacher night...  I met with both the boys' school teachers yesterday evening. It's amazing that Joshs' in Year 5 already! They boys are going just great at school! Their academics are great, their socialisation is wonderful, and Alex's teacher described him as  a delight!  See? It's  not  just  me  who's wholly biased that they're great boys! Their school is in such an amazing setting. On the outskirts of our rural town, the main playground is a huge open paddock. It's within sight of Pit Straight at the Mt Panorama racetrack! There are 6+ cows looking thru the fence at you with their big damp brown eyes as you walk about out there! There's a huge old gum tree leaning up against the far-end single-wire fence - it's a very cool climate to go to school at! Much different to mine - a lot of my schooling was all grey concrete! At the moment, Josh's class is running a shop in their classroom - complete with tables and rows of priced groceries, 2 cash registers, packing table, a storeroom, and each of them has a budget to buy their groceries. Very cool way to learn life-skills using simple and fun role-play! Josh found himself an old electric cash register a few years ago  (that kinda works...) , so it's getting some use by a lot more kids at last. I decided to walk there and back yesterday (I still don't own a car, but this place is small enough to walk everywhere anyway), and travelled about 4 or 5 kms by the time I got back home...  I walked into town afterwards - it's not all that far to their school!  The colour of the hillsides and the sky as they changed colours with the setting western sun was awesome to watch - at times I just stood still mouth agape enjoying the changing scenery all about me. It's a very pretty place to live, even if it got a bit cool by the time I got back. But it's the same as anywhere you live - you get used to it and take the beauty of it for granted - until you  stop, look and breathe.  
 
  Body Clock...  As I said the other day, I haven't been sleeping too well. But, now my body clocks' gone a bit spastic! The other night I was asleep by 9pm  amazingly,  yet I was wide awake at 3.30am! And this morning my eyes popped open and the brain started working at 4.25am! Argh!  lol  Oh well, I can rug-up out of the frosty air outside at that time of the day, slip on some quiet headphones, and write away!
 
 
  Inheritance and glasses...?  My immediate family is really very small. There's just my three boys, mum, 1 brother, 1 auntie and 3 cousins - I mean, that's  it!  I was the youngest of my family, and most of 'em have all died off! I had a bizarre experience a few months' ago, when a great-Aunt in her late 90's passed away. Although I hadn't had too much to do with her over the previous 15-or-so years, my brother and I were amazed to hear we were both small benefactors of her estate thru her will! When the cheque for a few hundred dollars arrived, I felt very strange - this was all there was that was left of my Auntie! Apart from memories, of course (there's some good ones there too). Well, there was one thing I've desperately needed for about the past 3 years - a new pair of glasses! The old frames were starting to wear out, and I needed to have my eyes tested again - it'd been 9 years since the last one! My eyes haven't deteriorated that much at all (I'm shortsighted and wear glasses 24/7... well, expect when I'm in bed! lol), but it was the new frames that were the revelation! They feel so  light  compared to the old ones! These plastic lenses are very cool - I keep forgetting I'm wearing the things most of the time! Now my nose doesn't have a dent from the weight on it from my old glasses (kidding!). Well, that's what it feels like. When I put the old ones on, like when I snip the grass or whatever, they feel like I'm wearing iron goggles! Silly 'ol me! So, now everything I look at, I keep in the back of my mind my old aunt - she gave me my new glasses.
 
 
  Stargazing...  Actually, now that I can actually  see  things at a distance a whole lot clearer (well, it sure feels like it!), I've been spending a bit of time checking out the nighttime heavens. Yeah - watching the stars! It's something I loved to do as a kid (I even used to have a small telescope - heaven knows whatever happened to that - I don't have it now!  sob! lol ). Braving the  cooler  evening air is a challenge - I don't stay out too long, believe me! - but the sky is so much clearer out here in the country than it ever was in the city (where I grew up). You can see heaps, just by letting your eyes adjust to the dark sky. There haven't been too many cloudy nights recently here - thanks, in part, to the 3-years drought we're in the grip of - D'oh! Besides, I've been hitting the local town library and picking up a few books on star watching ( not  astrology stuff!), which've helped me find the names of some of the clusters of starts and stuff out there. Hey, I think it's really interesting. You know, the sky is always there, but you just forget it's there - until you stop to look!

On the weekend I was sitting quietly in the backroom reading, when suddenly out of the silence I could plainly hear a bugle playing 'The Last Post'. I had no idea where it was coming from - it wasn't Anzac Day or Armistice Day or anything like that... I thought I must have been hearing things. The next day I read in the local rag that there'd been a short ceremony to mark 'VP Day' (Victory in the Pacific, 1945) at the local War Memorial. Of course - that was it! I live about 3 blocks from there - no wonder I could hear it so plainly. Mystery solved. Now I can put away the prozac again... for another day lol.

But thru this I've managed to catch up with an old mate I haven't spoken to in literally years. I was the best man at his wedding in the mid-80's, but since the early 90's we just lost touch. So, fingers' crossed, we can catch up together in Sydney somewhere in October. That'd be great. We used to play in bands together - he was the drummer at the very first pub gig I ever played in 1985.    Another guy I've caught up with is a bloke I used to hang out with during my final school years and late teens - mad crazy times for all of us. Well, stone me - he's a bloody University professor nowdays in Brisbane! Argh! pmsl! Aint it good how the years mellow and age us all gracefully! We're all hitting 40 this year. pmsl!

I'm totally amazed that at most of the venues, the stands and crowds are only at about 30-40% at best! That's terrible - it was never like that at Sydney! I'd give my eye teeth to see any sport at that level of competition (and the ticket prices are supposedly like 35% comparably cheaper than at Sydney), so it's a darn shame that people just aint turning up. I appreciate people want to catch finals, but there's been some great games happening already. I mean, like tonight, I was watching an outtake from an Australia Vs Japan baseball game - and there looked like there was only about 500 people in this huge venue! What a shame! people are suggesting there's all sorts of reasons, but I think it's much easier to sit at home and watch it all on TV in the comfort of your air-conditioned lounge, than for the locals to get off their asses and get out there! I mean, I'm sure there's people all over Europe who are thirsting to get down there to watch - Greece would be like just down the road for them to travel!

Well, the antenna on the roof of the house they must have been working on was bleedin' huge! It looked like something they could keep track of the Space Shuttle with! TV reception here is great, so I have no idea why they would want such a bizarre collection of bright shiny brand new antenna dishes and boxes and wires and stuff perched atop aerials and towers on their roof... my housemate joked that perhaps they're a local terrorist spy network or something... well, that's sure no way to keep it subversive, that's for sure! lol. So, if there's ever a problem with our TV reception or the local transmitter at anytime during this large sports carnival that's on at the moment, I'm sure all of Bathurst will lob on their doorstep to watch - I'm sure they could pick up the direct satellite feed, let alone a signal from Sydney, with all the gear they had installed on their roof! pmsl!

Does that mean I've got a crue-cut now? No way! It's still long - waaay over the collar, just a lot tidier. Ahhh - you gotta do these things every now and again. I think the last time I cut a big length like this was back in 2001 or 2002 - I can't remember. But all I've been doing lately is just clipping a cm off now and again, to stop those dreaded split enz! Argh! Gesus - I'm 40 now. I shouldn't still have bleedin' long hair at this age, should I? Not when it reaches half-way down your back, anyway. Now it's much more manageable. But, all the same, I bet I wake up tomorrow and brush my hair and go, "Holy shite, what have I  done ?!?" pmsl! No no, it's not that bad or short, really.       Michelle...  rang this morning, asking me for a copy of some paperwork that shows that we're actually divorced! She's 'creatively filed' hers at the moment - that's cool. I was gonna say "Oh No, sorry, but I can't do that!" when she rang, as a joke (she's still got a good sense of humour), but I didn't want to freak her out either! The thought made me chuckle all the same.       The boys  seem to be going well... Sebbie put a nail thru his foot the other day (not on purpose, you understand... lol), and Josh is playing his Shannon Noll CD to melting point, apparently. Hahahaa.       Manly  have undergone the most amazing turn-about in the history of the NRL, apparently. Last week they suffered their biggest lost ever and this week they won by heaps! If anyone was going to win the footy-tipping this year, it would be from pure  luck  alone!      Not much happening out here, if you don't count  reading , reading and reading stuff about Teaching Adults, Program Planning and Teaching Portfolios! Bwrhwahahaha! Getting there, slowly slowly. My housemate is keeping the TV on 24/7 while that  big sports carnival  in Europe is on... that's fine, 'cause I got to see the rowing first-up! That keeps me happy. I've got written down when the eights are racing, so - look out!  "Oar - boat - row!"       I found an amazing  Beatles  DVD 2 days ago (I can hear you sigh and roll your eyes, you know...), a documentary of their very first visit the the USA. Great vintage stuff - 40 years' ago now. Does that make it classical music yet? Thoon is dancing to Crowded House at the mo - he's smiling thru a nice clean tank this arvo too. Well, the DJ seems to alternating between the Crowdies, XTC and Rolling Stones - very eclectic! And, the biggest news is - I have a cut on my big toe on my right foot! Boo hoo! pmsl.

"New Cosmetic Product Makes Wrinkles Almost Invisible to the Naked Eye!"                  If you would like to:           Look as much as 20-years younger.. in less than one minute...     (without the pain and side effects of Botox injections), this will be the most unbelievable (but true!) message you will ever read.      Can you believe this garbage??? Deleted, of course! Hey! I've  earnt  every single one of my wrinkles! pmsl

Well, after making and signing the original and a copy, filling in and ticking all the right boxes, I was all finished - after a total of 10 minutes!!! Whoo hoo! If only every other year was as easy as this one when it came to tax time!

                                                                          The local library here is a goodie. Great size, range and availability. I grew up in Sydney, and if you were able to get a 2-week borrowing limit for a handful of items, you were lucky. Here, you can borrow upto 50 items for 4 weeks - for free! Amazing. Plus they have a great range of CD's, DVD's and videos too. On Monday I borrowed a few things from there...        Mental As Anything, "Beetroot Stains"   (CME 2000) - I heard this CD by this old classic pub-rock Aussie band about 2 years' ago, but I didn't get a good listen of it. I wasn't very impressed with it then, but I thought I'd give it another listen. Yup, I was right - I'm still not impressed with it! It sounds like it's a band demo recording! Weak songs, nothing really catchy (like you'd expect from the Mentals). There's only 2 songs I prefer, the 2nd one "Special Filter" (and then only 'cause it's got a good groove happening), and No. 6 "Narelle" (a funny story of an Aussie BBQ gone wrong...).        "The Truman Show"   DVD, with Jim Carrey. This is one of those films I've never quite gotten around to watching yet, so I thought I'd borrow it. I'm not really a Jim Carrey fan, yet he hits the spot in this thing. I like this film. Great concept (I love the light falling from the sky, the early sunrise, smashing his boat thru the horizon, the guy jumping out of the Xmas present, the sky-diver...), and well filmed, if a bit artificial. But, hey, the whole things' supposed to be artificial, so that's probably a good thing, hey? Good for a laff.      And finally... something on a totally different track (And now for something completely different...?) Ken Burn's documentary on the American  Civil War . Now, I am definitely NO fan of war, but for purely the historical interest in the thing, this is great. What a waste of bloody life. It's hard to imagine living in a time like that, as a country literally tries to tear itself apart. Australia's never had anything remotely like that happen to us in our brief life - all our fightings' been for bloody someone else! pmsl! It's hard to imagine all those men dying on battlefields in such lovely quiet little country spots like Gettysburg. Madness. Pure madness. But, like I said, I've never had to live thru anything like that - a nation going thru it's growing pains so rebelliously. Australia's growing pains all seem to be expressed internally. Yet they are just as potent as the factors that caused the Civil War... hhmmm...

It's kinda a legendary thing - stuff I haven't seen before, and believe me I've seen a  whole lot  of stuff about The Beatles over the years! It's an official Apple documentary from their first visit to the USA in February 1964 by the Maysles Brothers, called " The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit " (Apple 07243 599360 9 3). It's a pioneering documentary as well, and it's got some great laid-back behind-the-scenes footage of The Beatles just hanging out, and their very first live gig and TV appearances in America - historic stuff. It hasn't been released since it was first showed in 1964 (was released afresh last year, 2003). Wow - even after 40 years, this stuff is still wonderful. Their Washington Coliseum gig is just pure  magic . There are moments when they share glances between each other during the gig, and you can tell by the looks on their faces and in their eyes that they're thinking, "Wow! We're really  are  playing - in  America !"

She's a kind old thing, and she's almost a local landmark for everyone in the immediate area, who all like to stop and say hello to her. Well, today I was taken aback when I saw a big "Auction" sign across the front of her place! My first thought was, "Oh shivers, she's died!" I didn't know what to think. As I was walking back, there were two people cleaning up a bit around the small front yard of the place, and I asked them, well, where was she? Was she OK? It turns out that she's simply gone to a nursing home. Fair enough - she looked a pretty frail little thing. I'm just glad nothing awful happened to her. It's funny how it's little things like that shock you in such a strange way.

My mind was 100 miles away, thinking dark cloudy thoughts, as such. I noticed 2 people get into a car parked outside a house about 50 feet in front of me, but didn't think any more of it. Suddenly, when I drew parallel to them in the car, a huge barked WOOF roared out from behind a closed gate from the right in the darkness. I literally jumped sideways, nearly tossing the blasted shopping trolley onto its' side. In my muttered cursings of being brought back to my senses from my reverie, I looked at the woman sitting in the passenger seat, and she was wetting herself laughing. Well, I couldn't help but laff myself - it must have looked pretty funny. I laughed all the way home.

He knows I've got a 'thing' for  Greece  (which has absolutely nothing at all to do with the Olympics, by the way...). For my birthday last week, a large parcel arrived on the doorstep. He'd found a picture-book all about Greece, and had posted it up to me! Whoo hoo! I still can't believe the amazing colours of the place - it's almost unreal. The water is unlike anything I've ever seen before - almost satin. So, that adds upto 9 books I received for my birthday this year - 6 by George Johnston, 1 by Robert Lowell, and 1 on Greece! Whoo hoo! And there's 1 more Robert Lowell book to come - gees, I'll have to build a bigger room to fit them all in, I think... ahhh, you become more bookish as you get older, you know... well, that's my excuse, anyway...! lol

                                                                                Josh  turned 11 at 12.25pm yesterday! Those years' have seriously flown past. I can still remember the very first time I met him - I held him in my arms, and promptly burst into tears! It was a whole mixture of joyful emotions all overwhelming as soon as I held my first-born son! Sigh! Precious memories!    Yesterday I met the boys for a brief afternoon tea after school. Of all the little bits and pieces I got for Josh, while he loved the Shannon Noll CD (gaps! lol), the thing that grabbed his attention the most was a tiny transistor radio I got for free from the supermarket last week! He's excited that he can listen to the radio with the earplugs while he's riding his bike, and on the schoolbus! hahahaha! All three boys said they knew all the words to Shannon Noll's single 'What About Me' (which I remember when the original actually came out - I even saw Moving Pictures play live at my local pub!!! lol)... but, all they knew was the first words, "What about me... mmm mmm mmm mmmmm..." pmsl! Boys will be boys. Nevertheless they popped it straight into the car's CD-player, and I'm sure my poor ex will be driven mad with endless replayings of the thing for the next few months! lol.    I had to laugh getting the Shannon Noll CD for him. (For those of you who don't know, Mr Noll was the runner-up at the last 'Australian idol' competition). He does nothing for me, and my flatmate and I had a huge laff when I told her I brought it. I told the girl at the checkout, "This is not for me, really!" But she smiled and probably thought, "Yeah, right!" It must be revenge from my own parents... they brought me a "Sherbet" LP for my 11th birthday (which I'm proud to say I still have!), and I'm sure their reaction was exactly the same as mine was to buying Shannon Noll for my own son... 'eewww...' PMSL! I am getting old!       Go the Wallabies  tonight!!!

As I slipped off my trakkies, I could have sworn I saw little sparks flashing in the darkness about my legs. For a split second I thought I'd totally lost it, or was having some nasty flashbacks from my late-teenage years or sommat! But, I did it again - slipped the trakkies down my legs, and - bingo! The static electricity was seriously causing tiny little flashes across my legs in the darkness! I'd never seen anything like that before - I felt like a kid making a new discovery! So, if you've ever got nothing else to do, in the middle of the night, get your eyes used to the dark, and try it with some staticcy clothes you've got. Zap!    I'll just go and play my banjo with my new glasses now... pmsl...

Actually, it's been freezing overnights (like most in the minusesesess...), but, apart from this arvo (and yesterday mornings' huge fog, come to think of it), the days have been gloriously sunny!        Sebbie...   I was talking to Michelle this morning, and she told me a funny story from last night. They made and lit a really huge bonfire on the property last night, with lots of the boys' friends and cousins and stuff there too. Well, once the flames took hold and started leaping up into the sky, the mountain of fire was shooting up sparks really high up into the black night sky. Must've looked amazing. Then one of the kids said it looked like a volcano, with all the sparks rushing out. Well, Sebbie (who's 7) literally freaked out, and he bolted! He ran the 500+ meters all the way home, with poor Michelle running after him! The poor kid must have freaked out somehow - he must've thought it really  was  a volcano and bolted for the safety of home! He was fine by the time a puffed Michelle caught up with him, and he slept with his Nan last night (for fun), and he was fine today. But that's  very  Sebbie - you never know exactly what he's thinking sometimes! He's unique - beautiful!        Josh...   My eldest turns 11 on Friday - eleven?! I can hardly believe it! I'll catch up with him after school briefly on Friday, and then he's off to Cubs that night. He's gonna have a few of his friends over the next day, which he'll absolutely love. Whoo hoo! talking to my mum on the phone tonight, we were comparing notes at how fast he's growing up, and laffing at how small he was at what seemed like just a short while ago! Now he's gonna be a 6-footer-plus in just a few years, I reckon.          Manly...   We won! Manly beat Canberra today, in a great display of Rugby League! Now we'll be off the bottom of the ladder! Whoo hoo! (lol).
