       So, What has your Stephanie been up to?   Perhaps you've heard of paradise?  Yes well I"ve been there and back. This weekend I decided to go on three hikes in a row.  First we went to Masada, and since I"ve already been up  I opted to hike around instead.  IT was gruleing it was slippery, it was the least exciting of the 3 hikes.  The second hike was a quickie in ein gedi in wadi David.. to the pools and back.  Ein Gedi is paradise.  It's a national park in the hills next to the dead sea.  It hold hikes and fresh water pools.  IT's BEAUTIFUL!!! We were dropped off on the beach of the dead sea an thus we spend the night.  We pooled all our sleeping bags together in the parking lot and made a fire.  The bathrooms (5 shekel during the day ) were free at nice.  WE lay in the dust shared stories and gazed at stars.  VEry difficult to sleep, especially with the groups of bedouin boys blasting techno from their cars all night.  And heated arguments in arabic sounding off from al directions.   The sunrise over JOrdan and the dead sea was incredible.  And then we were ready to hike.   Back into Ein Gedi to wadi Avurot for a hike that stretched ffrrom 9-3!!!.  WE were dirty and dusty and sweaty and then every little bit there would be these cool fresh water pool, s oin we went.  IT was one of the best hikes ever..  half desert / hald tropical paradie , palm leaves and bammboo shoots overhead, mountain goats and ibexes running around.  It was brilliant.  and now i"m totall exhausted and ready to start my  third week of ulpan.

        I"m super steph today, on a major happy high.   SO exhausted after ulpan today I thought, now I'll just go to sleep.  But instead I read the newspaper with Michal (my roommate) and she helped me pronounce things and understand things.  It was also the first time that all 4 of us were in the flat at once : Michal, Ola, Barbara and me.  They are all so nice!   Anywyas.  so instead of sleeping, Michal told me that I must go to this hillel pool party cuz there is going to be dancing and music.  So I decided to go but not swim.  We had watermelon and pita and hummous and pickles and those gross bizzlies.  My firends hopped in the pool and eventually Cara suggested scrabble.  We began the game and Cara is super hardcore scrabble club girl so its was really challenging.  We attracted alot of attention during out game lots if israeli hillel kids came to talk to us.  I finally talked to Hagui our madrich who upon finding out I"m Canadian started gushing over our country and asking em how to get in. Haguy is our hike leader so I already really respect him.    While Cara and I were playing suddenly I see capoeira pants!!!! and this dude was talking to Haguy!!!  SO I got details about rodas .  Then the intructor actually walked buy so Rotem (capoeria pants man) called the guy over and I asked him when the classes begin and its soon!!! september 1st.  CAPOERIA!!!!!!!!!!! (I"m in such bad shape though!!).   Then... another Hillel guy asked me if I rapped, cuz he's putting on a show and he wanted a rapper.  SO I"m like, well  I do spoken word,  I can kind of rap.  SO then I htought.. dude! I"ll ask my friend Benjamin ( who makes beats on his computer)  if maybe we can come up with something.  SO for these reason I feel like I"m ion the clouds.  I'm so incredibly happy.  Who knows where to go from here.  Nothing might come out of it.. or possibly big things.  Next step : talk to BEnyamin!!!!!

        You should all experience the beauty of Israeli dancing.   I went again last night and had a much better experience than the first time ( which wasn't a bad one).  I actually got to learn a new dance -- and when you know the steps you ca go all out.        see, I think Israeli dancing is a good analogy for life. There are a series of steps that everyone does in their own style.  and the circle of people gets bigger as the night progresses and everyone looks different while thye dance but together they form a gorgeous fluid pattern.  And the music is lovley, and the dance steps creat a language.  I can read what step come next by watching the slightest body movements!      I had a great day today.  why?   because the OSP people are back!! yay!! I think I'l not stay home on my own for any more weekends its too depressing.        We had ulpan in a bombshelter today.  Not for any saftey reason, just because we moved buildings and we happened to have gotten the bombshelter room.  you sneeze in there and it sounds like an explosion.  Class was great, we played 20 question sin hebrew.  Our teacher Yaffa is wikkid!  The daily ritual has become to gather in the cafeteria after lunch and do our homework together.  This works out very well for us cuz we get alot done that way.  AFter wards I went to the vegetable sook.  Arabs seems to be drawn to me for some reason because Ashmail, a veg vendor, gave me his phone number and told me to call him when he gets to Canada.  Sure, Ashmail, sure.  AFter we went to the grocery store and they wouldn't take my credit car so now I have no cash.  Very annoying.  Alona, Ben and I are going to head to Bee rock tonight I think for drinks and bugles!!

        So what does the typical israeli family do on Shabbat evening in Beer Sheva?      I walked in the residential area near the dorms. I think the area is called Neighbourhood Gimmel. The houses look like stone shacks, but the view inside shows that they are much more elaborate on the inside. There aren't any lawn, just sandy lots often with debris. Some lots had plants growing. Every house had a table outside with blankets stretched over for shade. The houses were pretty close together , easier for neighbours to keep abreast of each others doings. Thus Friday night all the families were out on their porches, or at their table, strolling the sidewalks. The stray cats were out as well guarding their dumpsters. Little dogs were barking away. Instead of leaving your garbage in front of your house you have to bring it to the dumpster. Better that way cuz there are too many hungry straty creatures looking to tear bags up. All in all, a pleasant walk. But SO different from home

       As he described his evening plans to  chekc out bars around the area she contemplated her own evening plans.  Because bars sounded more interesting then hiding in her room listening to memories of home she offered to accompany him.  Mistake?  Maybe.  She waited by the Dorm Pubs naming the trees after her friends from home so that she wouldn't be so lonely.  He arrived and he wasn't wearing a kippah.  she asked why and he mumbled soemthing about getting into fights in bars and not wanting to disrespect God.  Bee Rock?  Theystood outsie debating whether to go in.  And then the music reached her. Counting Crows. and in they went.  AT the bar they were offered bugles and olives and cabbage.  He bought the first round.  A german beer with a funny name for him  and Malibu and coke for her.  It was served as a double of rum in a galss and a separate glass of coke with a mixer.  The bar tender engaged them in toothpick games.  Make 4 boxes with these 8 toothpicks. Pinny was a real pleaser.  keeping the bugles filled up and fun coming.  Her companion downed his drink in second. and the girl had taken but a sip.  Her companion tunred moddy and strange.  growing very impatiend and silent.  she felt unconfortable.  She told him she would try to drink quickly.  He told he not to do so... but his action and expression were of the atmost impatience. Finaly they left.  The girl felt the need to apologise for the guys behaviour to the bar tender.  but she didn't.  The next idea was to find a bar called Publus which was supposed to be really lovley.  Bar Rock ws really lovely inside, decor wise.  So if Publos was even nicer. the girl was intrigued.  She thogut she knew her way.. and said so.  He disagreeed.  but then decided to try out her direction.  She had always claimed to ahve a great sense of direction but tonight it failed her.  Instead of a road.  they came to a sand path.  And thus they hiked in the dark along the fence.  listening to the soudn of night creatures.  in sandals , without lights she feared her every step.  He offered her a hand but she was independent and didn't want his assitance.  fianly they saw an opening in the gate.  they took. it.  suddenly a train appear!! IT's lights head towards them.  They stood back and watched it flood bye, beeping at them.  when the train had passed the crossed the track and were met by another fence.  At this point the girl wracked with fear and nervousness was ready to turn back.  The boy suggested walking along the track a bit.  they did.  and within 15 metres there was an opening in the fence.   they crossed into a neighbourhood.   he dodged all her questions.  Waht's your family like? who is you best friend?  The girl wanted to dig into the detail of this boys life.  She wanted to know whay he was so aggresive and why he was so aloof and impatient and extreme.  He didn't answer He didn't want to talk.  he wanted silence.  but silence made her uncomforable with him.  They arrived at Publos.  IT was a hole in the ground.  But a hole with charm.  They sat on couches.  the girl bought the round this time.  another German beer for him which he downed as quickly as the last time.  A banana cream cocktail for her.  Which he spilled.  In a clumsy just from couch to couch he banged the table and her drink spilled.  fine, cuz she didn't want to finish it anyways.  One of the stray cats in the neighbourhood was on the couch and  trying to eat his shirt.  (all the more reason why dogs rule and cats drool.. scary scary creatures).  The girl was eager to get out of the pub .  she was embarrased by his aggressive manner and clumbsiness.  Yet at the same time she wanted to be a firend to him.  She didn't know what to make of the situation.  She was happy that he was going away for the weekend and that she woulnd't feel the need to offer to see him again.  In sum,  the desert adventure had been thrilling.  But in the future, she would be more careful in chosing her companions.

        Guess what?  I could have gone to Jerusalem for the weekend accomidation tours and all for 25 shekels, that's 5 bucks.  How could that be? Well,  we were invited to a bbq last night organised by Jeff Seidel.  Someone sponsers this dude's organisation and they function like missionaries Jews for Jews.  They have established a centre just for us equipped with internet and washing machines.  They will be having lecutres and Talmud tutors... and guess what else?  They are offering stipends to for people who want to do continous study with them.  (Dad are you jumping for joy yet?)  The thing is.. that I want to learn Talmud with them anyways, I woud do it even if they weren't offering the money.  The same organisation also sponsered this Jerusalem trip.  I opted to stay here and relax instead.  I'm not in the mood for touring and socialising all weekend.      Every day here increasing my realisation that I"m in genuine heaven.  My new friend Kara asked me if I wanted to work out with her.. so I was at the gym for the first time.  And working out felt brilliant.. working it to the techno unde blue and green lights in a really friendly atosphere.  And after working out just walk out to the pool for swimming and tanning!  And for dinner?  WAlked across the street to my home and prepared myself a guacomole salad for dinner.  Its like .. how can you not be healthy when all these healthy options are layed out before you.    The hebrew is really challenging.  I'm really awful and memorising things  especially minute details like where letter go and when.  But I love the classes.  Our teacher is wonderful, and she's going see about gettting us Rechov Soom-Soom (hebrew sesame street that we used to watch in elementary school).  We get to sing kids songs in class and read kids books.    Its weird cuz I feel like I"m in the position to serve as a model for some of the OSP kids.  Like soem of the girls I"ve met seem to be super insecure ( as I was when I was younger as well).  and then I say things like " oh, the first test doesn't matter... its beneficial cuz it just show you what you need to improve on"  and my friends eyes lit up like that never occured to her before.  And this other guy was just amazed that I like to dance and didn't need to drink first.  COME ON!! Dancing is the best thing to do with your limbs  best utilize that ability right?    Now here is a note to anti- americans.  for those Canadian who look down on American.. my trip is proof that there is no difference betwee nus and them except maybe environments.  The kids on this trip are sweet and super super intelligent and political and not at all ignorant or snobby.     I"m looking forward to a week of tanning and swimming and writing letters and oing hebrew homework.  Sunday is the first day of the week here so tonight is like friday night.. except stores are still open.    Right let me say one more thign abuot the germans.  as I think I already said in the blog... the ulpan consists of both germans and americans ( and soem token canadians).  The majority of the Germans here are not jewish.  At first that kind of puts confusion in my heart.  but apparently Jewish Studies is a big thing in Germany.  I made firends with a girl from Romania yesterday.  She isn't jewish but she won a scholarship to come here for the summer.  She does jewish studies at home.  now the eve weirder thing is that the majroity of the germans are even better at hebrew than I am!!  crazy eh?  seems almost liek it shoudln't be.  But kudos to them to taking an interest in us eh?

        Gosh what a change. I went from being bored and glum to being Steph Supreme.      Ulpan : So fun! The hebrew is flooding back to me. We read this text yesterday and I comprehended most of it with the exception of several words. Today we learned what all those words meant.. but I didn't realise that they were the word from the text until I did my homework today. When I reread the text I knew every word!!! Waht a thrill.    The othe rcool thing about ulpan is that today, I had frined to sit with. that's right, I"m beaming :)      AFter ulpan I bumped into this guy who I had given directions to in the morning. He's a new OSP student and since the office was closed I offered to take him to the bookstore. SO we went on a little adventure. He's a kickboxer but he seemed to be very adverse to capoeria. I thought there was soemthing a little.. pushy or abrupt about him.. then he told me he was going into the American military. yup. that' explains it.       We returned to the dorms and parted ways. Michal was i the room when I got there. I shouwed her my hebrew books and hten she encouraged me to do my homeowrkd so that I could hlep. and while I did myhomework she made me lunch! and bought me chocoalte! I honestly didn't know what to expect form israelis... i thought they would be ruder but they are SO INCREDIBLY NICE, not just Michal but everyone's roommate seem to be super super super. Anwyas had an increidble bonding afternoon with Michal. I ended up doinga ll my homeowrk wrong but she helped me understand why.       Then Igot a phone call from Ben asking if I wanted to go to Canion Hanegev to go to Zara. So Alona, Ben and I hopped into a cap and booted over to the mal! I thought about my last Zara excusrion with Sarah and Leah, and about shopping bonanza with Sara, Lyssa and Brett. Ben and ALona make fun of my Canadianism. They are super super nice. I don't.. but I really feel like ALona is going to be my first real friend ( I"m such a nerd eh?).      Tonight there is a lecutre on AFrica Diaspora (YES!!!! my tpoic of hcoice!!)/ So you knwo what that means.... NO BORING NIGHT!!!!! and guess what.. please applaud. last night... I sleep through the whole thigns without waking up.       I HAVE ARRIVED!!!!!!

        Yay!!! what a nice night.  I am a very lucky girl.  Just when I thought that I could handle it any more that I had absolutley no one to talk to I decided to just sit and chill on the benchs beneath my flat.  Who walks by  but Ben from the other day and he has a Zara bag!!! ZARA WOOHOO.  SO we are chatting and then this girl Alona walks by and she introduces herself and we start chatting and we have tons to say!  She was going to her firend's house to do homework so I joined her and met and other girl.  These girl both go to UCSD (the school I applied to in california).  The girl's who aparemtent we were in starts talkign aobtu her boyfriend and how they had to break up cuz  he wasn't jewish and how senstivae and alone she flet so far away from her family and I was like YES I"M NOT ALONE!!! and yea  these girls ( Miriam is her name) was great! and from there the night just got better.  We ended up going to this super store plaza with a group of people and I chatted with all of them and eneded up staying for coffee with Blare and Dina.  I"Ve now convinced several girls to coem to try capoeria.. everyone suprising seems to know what it is and be interested in it! Wow its ike magic .. all of a sudden i have access to all these new poeple.  It happened so quickly and it happened just when I needed it most.  I am a lucky girl.  Let's see what happens next!      by the way guess what Mega store was in this plaza?  OFFICE DEPOT.  sheesh

        The key to getting through the day here is to set little goals.   1.  Make lunch,  first wait for the mayo and corn bits to cool   2.  In the mean time, check email   3. Purchase books   4. Find a nice bathroom on campus   5. Do homework .. but save that until 8 a night so that it will keep you busy and prolong the urge to crawl in to bed (which would result in a 1 am wakeup)      Today was the first hebrew class.  I'm in the second level.  One up from beginners.  The shame.  But I was one of the better kids in the class.  IT was really really fun.  At first I couldn't make words form.. but then I was really into it... and I bought my first book!!     Discovered 3 varieties of washrooms so far.   1. Dark scary smelly   2. Clean bright smelly   3. Clean bright non-smelly!!!!!   My big discovery of the day those nice toliets.  The toilet paper here is pink.    I"m feeling good today.  Chatting with Michal again this morning.  Ate the best yoghurt of my life..   its yoplait but for some reason it tastes way better here!!  Apparently another roommate who speaks English had moved into the flat.. MAYBE SHE'll BE MY FRIEND?!?!?  I have this really werid approach to making friend.  I"m really anti social in groups settings.. saying very little.  I wait and let the grops forms and then I work my way into groups at a smaller level.  I didn't actually DECIDE to do this.. its just how it seems to be working out.  Wish me luck.

        OK, first israeli breakfast : croissant au chocolate et lait et chocolate. Why do I feel queasy after all that chocolate? I thought eating was supposed to make you feel BETTER. So I showed up for this supposed orientation and apparently I"m way too early. I 've been to both the OSP and MAPMES offices to find someone who can vouch for my health insurance and BOTH officed are closed on Sundays. Great. So apparently the MAPMES meeting is either and 10 or 10.30 in that building where the ulpan is being held. Perhaps today's luck will change and something will actaully go right. It's super hot, but the interiors are air conditioned (kind of.. ) and there seems to be aloto f comfortable seating about. I met my other roommate this morning when we both met in the washroom. I suspected someone else was around last night when the main lights which I had left on were switched off and the bathroom lights were switched on. Anyways she told me I had so much brave and then offered the frigde to me so that was really nice. Now.. wish me luck... I'm off to the bathrooms, I wonder if there is toilet paper      P.S. there seems to be a proliferation of slushis in this uni cafes.. SCORE! (no bubble tea sherbet as yet)

        Yay! I made friends. Went into uni, passed the machine gun toting security guard and got to the atm. Money, good. The campus was totally dead. no open doors just men with machine guns. They seems to be hanging out in the background wherever you look. On my way back I thought maybe just maybe the cafe across the street would be open .. IT was!!! Jen and Ben from MAPMES were sitting there so I picked up a drink and joined them beneath the tent lounging on pillows on the carpet laden ground. Bedouin style. They were heading over to the pool so I decided to join them.. so happy I did. This massive sport s complex is next doors and they had three pools... one for laps, one for play, and one for kids... tennis courts and stadium. Anyways so we tanned and swam away the day! SO much better then sitting in my empty room trying to keep myself awake. Tehy say that the best way to beat jet lag is to stay out in the sunshine. check! See if I can stay up til 11 tonight and maybe just maybe sleep the whole way throuhg. I also learned some hebrew by interpreting the labels of my mano nectar and my hommous.

        For a mere 25 shekels (5 bucks) I reentered the sports complex for dancing bonanza. I got there super early and when I went in they were still setting up. One the lawn next to the pool there were disco lights and salsa music blaring. Salsa shmalsa. I want ISareli danincg. So I went on the the gym and watched for an hour and a half as the couples twirled around. I had to refuse a couple offers saying in my terrible hebrew that I didnt' know the dnaces. Finally it turned into singles!!!! SO I followed people's steps until I was sweaty and tired. IT was awesome! Wow. It's 11.21 this is good. let;s see if I can hold out until 12 before sleep. Tommorow is capoeria.. I hope capoeria will be a bit better then the dancing tonight. It kind of sucks when ou don't know a single dance... more exhasuting to follow people around then when you actually know the steps. Orientation tommorow!

        Here I am. Israel.       Weather  : scorching between 1pm-4pm, otherwise pleasantly hot, no humidity, cool evening.         Accomadations  : 4 bedroom apartment in dormitories across the street from the Uni and the sports centre. Met one girl Ola who is moving out. Michal, will be staying on but I haven't met her yet. One bedroom is empty (will stay that way?) Unfortunately there is no oven in my little place thus all my photocopied recepies could have stayed home. There is a gas stovetop that you have to light with matches (scary). I'll be sticking with cold foods for now. There is a mini gorcery stoe, laundry, computer labs,study rooms and pub all in this complex. My bedroom is very comfortable and will be more so when I invest in a pillow.       So what have I been doing?  When I told various airport workers that I as moving on to El Al they rolls their eyes "oymygod you'll be waiting in 4 hours lines". But when I got to israeli security it was really fun. She asked me all about my life.. why I ws going to israel how I learned hebrew. my shule, my parent's hebrew names it was hard core but she was really really nice. Flight was fine.. finally saw my first shrek (the 2nd one) and mean girls. and listened to onflight radio CUZ THEY WOULD NOT LET US LISTEN TO CDS ON THE !0 HOUR FLIGHT. but it eventually ended and I arrived. Was met by the madrichim Hadguy and Lilach and the supervising prof Mark Gelber. I am considered a MAPMES student while the madrichim were really there for the benefit of OSP students. They have all paid for extra trip's and stuff. Yesterday we toured the campus, ate pizza lunch and chilled out. Today I went for a hike with the OSP kids at a Wadi.. Avrut I think. Saw gazelles and waterfall ad had interesting talks. yumy yummy sandwhiches for lunch. After we went to Sde Boker, saw Ben Gurion's grave. IT's cool cuz Hadgui/Hagui (can't remember which) and MArk Gelber have opposing political views on israel's environmental/ social policies so its nice to hear the debate going.       Me  : I"m super jet lagged and my right ear feels like its getting infected. was a bit overwhelmed yesterday but now that I have toilet paper, bought water hummous and pita, emptied the fly covered garbage left by absent roomates, and money.. I feel good. Tommorw I will be adventurous and go walk to find the big superstores that Gelber pointed out on the bus ride home. I also can't wiat for the library to open.. you see, everythign is closed for shabbas so I don't know what is or isn't open. Also I hear that there is Rikudiyah tommorow (israeli dancning) WOO HOO!     Contact :  Shortly I will be recieving an 800 number that makes it free for anyone in Canada to contact me. The only charges are for minutes on my end (damned cellphones). I also found this faux msn thing so I will try to get on msn once in a while. The time difference in 7 hours ahead of Canada and I guess only 2 or three ahead of England..    c'est tout,    love, Steph

        Guess what time it is. Yeah, 2.50 AM.  So it's still shabbat, I still can't sleep and my ear still hurts.  But the night is gorgeous.  I"m so happy I decided to leave my room and get out cuz the night is fresh and inviting.  Makes me ache to walk and explore.  But technically I should be sleeping.  Yet,  I"m not the only one in this money computer lab that open 3 pm til 8am.  I say money cuz these compters have cd roms and I think that's a printiing station next to me.  Advil is a life saver.  Let's all cross our fingers that the infection ( which jumped across ears clandestinely) doesn't reach the painful heights of ye who I left behind a week before in Canada. I almost dread to think of how I"ll keep myself busy tommorow.  I have discoveed that there are capoeria classes in the gym across the street on Sunday.  What a good location eh? Dance and cap just across the street.  Ok, let's try this sleep thing again.
