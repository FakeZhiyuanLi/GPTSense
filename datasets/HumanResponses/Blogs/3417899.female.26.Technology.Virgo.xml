      I've spent the last hour or so reading other people's posts. Some made me laugh, some made me smile, some mad eme jealous and several were just empty for me.   Then I came back and read my own - trying to see what picture of myself I had drawn to the anonymous stranger reading me.   I realize now what a distorted image it is.  In my posts, I sound unhappy. Unfulfilled.  I sound like a woman obsessed with her career and what people think of her (and to those who could read my Hebrew poems - with sex).   Is that really who I am?   An acquaintance who had read my posts said they were very ... "me". Are they really?   Because when I re-read them, I don't think they reflect the myriad of who I am. This bolg displays my insecruties. And I olny write when I am depressed, or concerned, or unstable.  I think that is the reason this blog will never really mirror who I am. I don't come here when I feel loved and protected (which I do, every day). I don't come here when I'm content. ther's no point in writing then. I revel in my hapiness then.   So no, these posts are not me. They are one piece of me. The piece that needs to be put in writing for me to acknowledge it, to dissect it and analyze it, to udnerstand it better.  That other piece - the strong, secure, beautiful, loving piece? That one is out there in the real world.

      My new SE (I'll call him Harry) is.... well.... stupid. I can't find another word for it. Not stupid as as in lacking knowledge. But stupid as in lacking... emotional IQ. Maturity. He is obnoxious. He is annoying. He is scattered. He is... well...  repulsive.   I feel bad for him. He has a sweet 2 year old daughter and a wife that moved all the way to this city for him to take this job.  He's really trying to be good. Making an effort.  But every meeting with him is a disaster.  Every customer... I can tell... is "rubbed the wrong way" by Harry.   I know he feels uncofmortable with having a 26 year old as his boss (He is in his late thirties). I know he doesn't like working with someone who has less experience in the industry then he does (heck, when he was already working as an SE I was barely in high school).  So he disrespects me. And he dislikes me. And he makes sure that's known.   But I am the one in charge. I get to decide his future. My word is valued and if I say he's gone - the he's gone.  (In the army, a commander can chose who will "carry his weapons", who he trusts. In the sales team, a sales executive can chose their SE).   I feel bad for Harry - I know he might not deserve this. But he's got to go. I can't work him.  Four months is a long time to give someone "a shot"... right?   Right?

I wish I could dissect the factors and pinpoint the exact combination of parameters: is it someone I spoke with, something I wore, a song I heard, an achievement I reached, something somebody said, the weather, the time I woke up or went to sleep, whether I made love...  Today was one of these days.  Today is almost over.

      I am going to get a guy fired. Not out of revenge (although it defnitely serves him right for being such an ASS). He is not good enough - professionally speaking. And he is not a team player.  So I'm going to get him fired. Life's a bitch.

      He didn't write. He didn't IM. He didn't call.   He's not my lover, my friend or my colleague. He barely ever was.   But it's him, that nobody, ignoring me - that is driving me up the wall.

      The assignment is not that complicated - a small assembler program that encrypts a string based on a given algortihm.  I've written programs way more difficult. This used to be a joke.  My rusty brain can't even comprehend the basics now.

      I hate to think of myself as shallow - but after my weekly conversation with Mom last night - I am begining to realize I probably am.     To those who don't know me, I am sure I am the epitomy of depth and sophistication. After all, I am well-read, well-versed, well-dressed.  But to those who know me, I am just ME.   The books on my shelves include Freud, Tolstoy, Geoffrey A. Moore, and Bush. But if you look closely you'll see that "Confession of a shopaholic" and "1st to Die" and the most worn...   The conversations I have with fellow business executives over lunch cover topics such as world politics, the flailing economy and the outsourcing of jobs - but I am only really enthusiastic when I discuss "American Idol" or "The Apprentice" with friends.      Mom was telling me about a Brith she attended. She met our neighrbors and old friends from the neighborhood (Old saps who judge people by the money in their bank accounts and the make of their car). I haven't seen any of them (or their sons/daughter of my age) in at least 6-7 years.  I have nothing to do with them.  And yet - I wanted to make sure they knew that I had MADE IT. It was important to me that they know I have become a somebody (have I?)   "Did you tell them - I got married?  I live in the US?  I am a Director at my company?  I make lots of money?..."  "I hope you didn't tell them -  I never completed my University degree I gained so much weight I don't have an apartment yet..."  Why do I care?   SHALLOW.

      I've decided to buy a harmonica. I used to play. I'm trying to get back in touch with that artisty side of me that somehow got lost in the race for money, for a better business card, for respect.   I used to write, I used to dance, I used to play the piano and the harmonica, I used to read (a lot). I used to have depth...   It seems like the more money is poured into my bank account, the more meaning is drained from my soul.

      I am 26 years old and married. I have a career, a husband and self-confidence. I am good-looking enough to like what I see in the mirror - depsite the extra pounds. I am smart enough to be part of an intelligent conversation or even lead one. I am successful in many people's eyes and I lead a life one could envy.   And yet I still indulge in acts of shameless immaturity - swaying my hips when I walk out to lunch - just because he is looking. Biting my lips and looking into his eyes when we talk shop. Carelessly leaning my knees against his on the flight back form a business trip together. Feeling angrily deceived if he acts like he does not notice me (or maybe it's not an act).   What is it about me and authority figures? I had had an forbidden affair in the past with a manager. Dated a course instructor in the army. Why do I need to conquer them?   I love my husband. But I like to indulge in these forbidden acts of immaturity for a little flirty boost. And then I go back home. Never taking the flirtation any further.&nbsp;He never showing any signs of surrender.   I wonder what would happen if he did.

      I used to be a good writer. There was something about the way I could put the words together that touched people.  Time, and the lack of practice, have robbed me of these abilities and now - just writing this blog is an effort.  I'd like to change that.  I *need* to change that.  I will. I'm back.

      Their faces smeared in black, brown and green paint.  Their rifles on their shoulders. Gear on their backs: stretchers, a radio, a flag, missiles.  They stand in threesomes. Getting ready for the journey ahead.  They chant songs.  There's a brotherhood among them, you can tell.  The camera lingers on each one of their faces, some of them smile or wink, or give the "thumbs up". Others look pensive or somber. Tired.  Then they jog, adrenaline pumping, behind their commander. Running in the rain, hours on hours.  Some faint. Others help them get up, make it through.  Their commander is tough, but encouraging.  The cameraman alongside capturing moments of weakness, and moments of courage. Camera bobbing along, covered in raindrops. Moments of deep camaraderie.  Then the ceremony. The tired soldiers, standing proud.  The camera once again, lingers on their faces: their eyes filled with strength and satisfaction. And admiration for themselves. Their comrades. Their commander.  The commander stands in front of the platoon. He speaks - a speech filled with patriotism and idealism. A speech inspiring and touching and moving and energizing. The soldiers watch him speak with adoration.  Goosebumps.  Then HE walks amongst the rows. Shaking their hands. Pinning a pin to their lapel. They thank him.   I watch with tears streaming down my cheeks. Watch them and a shiver runs down my spine.  My little brother. The commander.  My little brother.

      It's been a few days since my last entry. When reality is poignant enough, it drains enough energy from you as to deplete the reservoir of creative energies too - those usually reserved for the late night hours, and for this blog.

      ...Than grow old.   In the past few weeks I have spent some time at different medical institutes. In each one of these offices, I bring down the average age substantially. Typically, I am surrounded by elderly people - in wheelchairs, or using walkers, or with scabs on their skin, or shaking uncontrollably, or barely hearing, or in apparent pain.   It's always been my uttermost fear - the fear of old age. (I wonder if there is a formal term for this phobia).  What kind of life is it - to have no control over your body, to be dependent on others. No life. At least not one worth living.   I have told my husband repeatedly - I would rather die. As soon as I can not care for myself, my body, or my soul - I want OUT. I've gotta find a way to make it legal. Have some lawyer just put a bullet through my forehead.  I hope I don't have one of those "humanitarian" kids who want to keep me around for the sake of their conscience... (Maybe I need to make sure they have a killer inheritance - they won't want to wait too long).  I found this response from some doctor on the web - written to a lady with fear of old age:   Ageing can be either seen as growing old or growing wiser. Old age brings wisdom and experience of the years, which can be of great benefit to the youth. It all depends on how you live your life today, physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. Ageing is inevitable and this reality cannot be changed. What can be changed is how we age. We can either age gracefully and with wisdom, or then we can age with resistance and fear. The only thing you can do is to keep yourself physically fit with good nutrition and exercise, of course without getting obsessed with fitness, because no one is &lsquo;age-proof&rsquo; and immortal. To keep fit psychologically, you could exploit your creative potential, practice relaxation techniques like Yoga etc., develop hobbies, and develop a sense of humour to see the lighter side of things. Socially you can keep fit by developing good interpersonal relationships, which are meaningful and fulfilling, you could engage in some social work to give back to society. This can be deeply fulfilling. On a spiritual level, you could work towards having an &lsquo;emotional closure&rsquo; in all your relationships, by forgiving and asking forgiveness for all the hurts caused by others to you and by you to others, by prayer and meditation, and by finding and fulfilling the purpose of your life. Your past has formed your present, and your present will form your future. Be the best of who you can be in the &lsquo;here and now&rsquo; because that is what is in your hands, and then leave the rest. Here is a prayer of St. Francis for you, which I hope will give you strength.  O Lord, Give me the courage to change the things that I can, The Serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, And the Wisdom to know the difference.

      I just made love with my husband.  You'd think that wouldn't be a big deal - married couples make love all the time.  Most of the time.  My husband and I last made love on our anniversary - in February.  And then again - today.  Not the quick "in and out" either.  When I'd descended from my peaks and the room was calm - he sarcastically said that I just bought myself another three months.   Aside from that sentence - it was almost perfect.

      Be an adult and take criticism as you should: as a constructive feedback you learn from. And move forward.   My boss has accompanied me in my last business trip and observed me interacting with  prospects. He gave me three notes of criticism:   1) Use the term "Back Office" instead of "Back End". Ok, this is not too bad - I think. I can do that. It's not a critical comment. Doesn't mean I am not doing a good job. Fine.   2) I use "Very" too much. "Very", "Many", "Extremely", "Substantially", and other superlatives of this sort. This comment hit closer to heart. Perhaps, in my eagerness to push our product, to prove my belief, to convince.... or maybe my lack of English skills. Still, this comment points to a problem that is closer to being a character flaw than a technicality. Fine.   3) I shouldn't be so friendly, tell silly stories, put myself down, call myself "stupid".  To put things in perspective, I certainly do not put myself down or think I am stupid (If you are a frequent reader of my blog, you already know this). However, at an informal lunch today I did tell stories of my adventures on Ebay and how I fell for a silly scam, and perhaps I used the word stupid. I thought I was being charming. I had everyone at the table (20 people) captivated, listening, laughing at my punchlines. Was it improper? Should I have been more conscious of my professional image. Perhaps... In Hebrew, this is called "Fason". That's what he said I should have. Ouch... This one is not a technical comment. It is not something I can easily fix. It is my character. And my boss disapproved of it.   Take it as constructive critism - I tell myself. And still...

      H' is moving back to India. After 4 years in the great US of A, he is moving back to India - where the quality of life is lower, and the opportunities are almost in-existent.  He says he is going back to be promoted within the Indian firm he works for.  He is actually moving back to get married. His parents gave him a chance to find a "love marriage". After 4 years his time is up and his parents have made a decision for him.  An appropriate girl was found and the marriage has been arranged.  He will meet her for the first time at his brother's wedding. If he does not oppose the marriage - it is likely they will wed within a month.  It is pretty unlikely they will divorce - arranged marriages have a much lower rate of divorce than "love marriages".   How lucky are we to be able to chose our partners. To fall in love.  Or maybe only some of us are lucky. And some of us, those who can't find love on their own, are not lucky enough to have a family, and a society, that will take care of them so that they do not remain alone.   I wonder what will become of H'.  I have never been very good at staying in touch with people from the past - maybe I will make this an exception.

      Spun up a web to support my decision to leave my company.  Intricate, interwoven thin lines - conjured up in a way to sustain the weight of what I was about to do. The web grew thick and sticky, and at some point stopped being transparent and became an apparent mass.   And now I find myself having to take it back. Having to carefully retrace my steps and my sentences and set free all the words that caught in the web - alive or dead.   Only to find myself tied in. Tied up. Trapped by my own pretentious decision.  Putting my tail between my legs, lowering my head, and slowly backing away.  Changing my mind. Taking it back....

       (From Wired Magazine May 2004)  "Tiger woods has one. So does Lebron James. Ditto Dale Earnhardy Jr. No, it's not a $20 million licensing deal. It's something of potentially greater value: a personal logo"   It's intriguing to me how in life, different threads from different life "spheres" interlace and create some fabric of thought.   Following these two threads:  a) My friend M's latest blog and the ensuing discussion on the design of his company's logo (see http://alice.nc.huji.ac.il/~surf/Blog/) b) The above quote taken from Wired magazine  I've decided to put my personal skills to the test and find out whether I possess the creativity and the skills to design my own personal logo.  Here are some initial results ...

      In Atlanta, on the way to my business meeting - my boss and I are talking in Hebrew.  As the taxi driver pulls up to the office building complex he asks: "Where are you from?" With typically Israeli caution, my boss answers "California".  "No, I mean that language yu were speaking, where is it from?".  "Oh" we say "It's Hebrew. We're form Israel" "Are you Christian?", he asks.  "No, we're Jewish" we say.  "I thought you said you were Hebrew" he says "Hebrew is the language, Jewish is the religion." "And so what is Israel?" "That's the country".  "Oh..." (confused slience).   "So can you be from Israel and not be Jewish" "yes" "Can you be Jewish and not speak Hebrew" "yes" "Can you be from Israel and not be Jewish" "yes"  So who are the Hebrews?   We pull up to the office and the quetsion is left hanging. And I wish I could have stayed longer to explain the intricacies of the unique nationality, heritage and religion web that defines us.

      They missed their connecting flight - due to bad weather.  They are now stuck in Atlanta for the night - rather than being on their way to Guatemala city.  I am in town for business.  I ask them what their plans were in Guatemala, expecting to hear they were going hiking or backpacking or some other exciting reason to travel to this exotic country.  The response (in a deep Southern accent) catches me off guard: "We are going to adopt a baby".  They have a baby girl waiting for them in Guatemala. Sydney is 5 months old. They have already met her in March and spent a couple of weeks with her. It broke their heart to leave her there to come back to the US and complete the paperwork.  Now they were on their way to finally pick her up and take her home.  This delay - albeit being just a 24 hour delay - is devastating to them. You can tell in her voice. In his sigh.  One day shouldn't matter in the larger scheme of things... they will have her for the rest of their lives... she is worth the wait. I spurt so many cliches.   Puts my life in perspective - missing my sales meeting due to a late connection doesn't seem like the end of the world anymore.   P.S.  I like talking to random strangers on my travels. It may be interesting to include these strangers' stories in my blog. Defocus it from myself. I think I will just do that.

      In favor of staying:  - More money - Better resume - Important work experience - Leverage status at company (be "head to the wolves") - Higher standard of living - Peace of mind - Peace   In favor of leaving: - Return to family - Keep moving.. keep moving. - Leave a rotting company (be "tails to the lions") - Settle down - Start a new page - Return home.  Deicded to stay.  I am a prisoner of my own ambition.

      I was organizing my closets today (preparing for my parents' visit, clearing up some space for them to hang their clothes)...  I don't think I ever realized how many clothes I have. dozens of pants, hundreds (!) of tops.. enough clothes for 5-6 people's closets. Granted, not all of the clothes fit me anymore. Some are too small, some are (believe it or not) too big. Yet, the amount I have kept around is unbelievable.   I also noticed I have many clothes I have not even worn once. Clothes with the price tags still on them. I counted 9 shirts, 5 dresses, 4 skirts, 11 pants, 2 jackets, 1 suit. All brand new and never worn.   There's no point to this blog, really. Just an admission of waste.

      I don't remember when, or where... I'd been told of this book whose writer did not use the letter "ey" (first letter in the letters-series) in the entire book - from beginning to end! Hundreds and hundres of words... with this fluent story... one wouldn't even notice!  I believe the book is in French (or something of the like).   So, somebody took this book (don't remember who - but I should! He/She deserves it!), then converted it to English. The entire book! While still keeping the rule throughout the book's entirety.   Wow. How inspiring...  Is is VERY difficult! Indeed, I could only JUST finish this short blog...

      I never imagined I'd be writing this much about politics or Israel - but here we go again.   Another explosion, another tank, another 5 soldiers killed. This time hundreds of pounds of explosives were used, the tank and the soldiers practically vaporzied. Nothing left. No bodies to bury.   (In the Jewish tradition - the human body is holy and all parts must be properly buried).   Hundreds of soldiers are now on their hands and knees, on the hot desert sand using small cloth fliters to sift through the sands and find tiny parts of flesh...  The little plastic bags hold a few measly flesh bits.  Nothing left - but dust.

      You'd think after years of knowing how the press works, I'd be used to the fact that all news stations are biased. But still, today, I am fuming with fury.   Six Israeli soldiers were killed today in Gaza.  "They were armed soldiers" some of you may say. "They were casualties of war" or "they were there to kill". I would disagree with all of the above, but that is beside the point.   The point is what happened next. Body parts being flaunted, a soldier's decapitated head being waved in front of a camera, children stealing body parts: limbs, fingers, torsos - and hiding them so that soldiers will not be buried. Song and dance on the streets of Gaza with bloodied hands waving in the air....  And yet - on CNN - here is what it says:  "...Six Israeli soldiers and seven Palestinians were killed Tuesday in what Israel Defense Forces called a major operation in Gaza City to destroy workshops making Qassam rockets, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian hospital sources. Four of the dead Palestinians were said to be children, according to Palestinian hospital sources...."  (Note: According to other news stations - fox, msnbc, ap wire - the palestininas dead were all armed - but again, besides the point).   The article mentions Palestinians are holding body parts as barganing chips. But it doesn't mention the partying, the bloody head in front of the camera, the teenager waving a limb of a dead soldier.   Not having this mentioned in CNN compounds the horror of the incident for me.   I keep wondering: what if the tables were turned? - If, G-d forbid, these were American soldiers' bodies?  - If these were Israeli masses mutilating Palestinian bodies?  what then?

      At the checkout counter - the cashier asked me for my ID. I had bought a little bottle of Irish Cream - to restock our bar. He wanted to make sure I was 21!!!!!  Yay! (FYI - I'll be 27 in August. People usually think I'm in my thirties - especially when I wearing a suit, and I hand our my biz card).   He thought I wasn't 21!!!!! YAY! Wo hoo!  :-)

      I was looking up some of my old favorite quotes (for a friend). Came across this one, which I had almost forgotten:   "If A is success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut." Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955), Observer, Jan. 15, 1950.   I've never been too good at Z. Yet - I'm quite successful. Am I the contradiction to the Einstein's rationale?   I think this formula lacks some of the factors which affect success:  q is charisma r is tact s is demagoguery t is sheer luck  The formula would be A = t*(x + y + max(z, q+r+s))

      Had an MRI scan today. Have you ever had one of those?  No matter how prepared I thought it was, it was a very strange experience.  I would venture to say it was a test of mind of over matter.   Here's what went down:  I get there. After waiting for a bit, the MRI tech approaches me (what a hottie!) and guides me towards the changing room. I put on the robe. A few minutes later, I am guided to the MRI room.  I lie on the MRI table. There's aluminum foil - or something like it - under the sheets.  I can feel it crackling under me.  The tech comes up to me and explains the process: The bed will slide into the MRI machine. I will hear noises: clicks, clunks, hums, rumblings - that's all normal. I have to be VERY CAREFUL not to move AN INCH. This is the most important thing, or the results won't be good, we'll have to redo the test. (I've waited over a month for this exam).  I am given a headset (covered in sterile paper). I put it over my head.  "I just need to position your hip" - he puts his hand on my hip bone and asks me to scoot over a bit.  ("Damn, why didn't I shave my legs!??") "OK - You're going in" he says. "I would recommend you close your eyes".  I do.  The bed start sliding back into the machine.  Once it's reached the position, I hear the tech's voice in my headset. "Are you okay?". Yes. "Okay - we'll get started with the first one. This will last 1-1.5 minutes". Okay.  One and a half minutes are a LONG time when you're asked not to move an inch.  I feel my breath as it hits the MRI machine in front of me - it must be very close. I fight a feeling of claustrophobia.  I want to open my eyes - but I don't dare. I'm afraid I'll get scared of what I see - and I'll flinch - which means I'll move - and ruin the scan. I keep them closed.  The machine is clicking and humming all around me. Louder than I had expected.  It's so hard not to move... my muscles feel cramped.  Then it's quiet.  The tech's voice again. "Are you okay?". Yes, I am. "That was good. This next one will take 5-6 minutes. Don't move".  5-6 minutes!!???!! Oh my - that will be hard. I didn't get a chance to readjust myself before the noise started again. A different kind of noise this time - sound like machine guns. My hips getting warmer and warmer... strange sensation.  My right leg flinches. "Shit!" I think. did I ruin the scan?  I open my eyes just a crack.. then I open them all the way.  The inside of an MRI machine is much smaller than I had expected. It's a tiny white tunnel, with long lights running through it. I feel like I'm in a tube. Or maybe a launching pod in one of those Sci Fi movies. I bet this is what it feels like it you're kidnapped by aliens.  More humming, more clicking, more noise. It takes all my concentration not to move. 5 minutes feel like a lifetime.  Then silence.  The hottie in my ear again (he sounds so far away). "How are you doing?". Okay. "This next one will be our last. Here we go".  Damn, he didn't tell me how long this one will last - will it be shorter or longer than the last one. I hope it's shorter.  The ticking and humming around me becomes monotonous - like white noise. My hips are really warm. My back is too. The minutes creep by and I try not to move. This is the most uncomfortable I've ever been. My left side is cramped, I wish I could stretch. Why didn't I stretch between scans? How much longer will this last?  Okay - maybe I should take advantage of this time and just think - abut things I don't have time to think about everyday - like my future, what I want to do in life. I can't concentrate. Damn I'm cramping! Did I move? Did I flinch?  Okay - maybe Yoga: deep breathing. long, deep breaths. Oh no, the breaths made me move!? Will it ruin the scan?  This is taking so long.... (I later found out the last scan took 15 minutes. Fifteen!!)  Finally, finally silence.  Hottie in my ear: "Good, are you okay?" yes... barely a whisper. "Let me just check that the scan came out all right and we don't need to redo anything".  I hold my breath.  "Okay! you're coming out!" The bed slides out. Hottie is there... It's over.   Now the wait begins for the results.   P.S. He asked me if I was having problems "voiding". I felt silly asking "what do you mean"... but I did. So for those of you who may be in a similar situation - "voiding" means going to pee.  and no - I don't have any problems :-)

She told me she misses my dad and she needs the intimacy.  I cringed.  They've been married 30 years. And they STILL have sex.    I bought the book "The sex starved marriage" (by Michele Weiner Davis). Maybe in it, I'll find some insight on why my marriage to my husband is sex-less.  God knows I love him. More than anything.  But when our marriage became "real". Reliable, stable, caring... sex became extinct.   A therapist costs $170 per hour. This blog is free.

      He is somewhere out there. A soul that knows mine.  I don't love him - not in the way we think of when we say "love". Not in the way I love my husband.  But he knows me.   We wrote this, together. I wrote a verse, he wrote the next. Back and forth. In anonymity.    Ask me no questions ; Tell you no lies; I must look away ; If you look in my eyes; My secrets are ancient ; Their flames washed in the rain; But where flames once had burned ; The red coals remain.  For too many reasons ; I keep things inside; Although I can trust you ; Some thoughts I must hide; For the sake of some tact ; For my sins or my shame; But you who asks questions ; Are the person to blame.  So let me just be ; let me hide, let me play The questions you ask - I can't answer today Let us keep on our masks ; Don't you dare take my shield Who knows what will happen when my face is revealed?   "Do not be afraid, dear" ; You must say in your heart; You try to get closer ; When I don't make a start; I can't pull the cover ; Made of secret or lie; So don't ask the questions ; Those I cannot reply.

      I've been obsessing about my weight recently... once again concerned with the size of my thighs, my buttocks. Losing sleep over whether I would look good in my old pants.    My best friend, we'll call her Rachel, found out she has fibroids on her ovaries. They are quite big: 8 cm, and 9 cm - on both ovaries.  She had an MRI done and learned that they are taking up so much space that if she were ever to get pregnant, the embryo wouldn't be able to grow - as there is no room for her uteros to expand. The fibroids take up all the room.   My favorite TV channel is Discovery Health. I can spend hours and hours and hours watching it, and never get bored.    [I think I was meant to be a doctor. I missed my calling. I always felt "right" in medical emergencies. Always calm, controlled. When I gave CPR to a biker girl who got thrown of the bike. When a colleague had an epilepsy attack]    My favorite show is "Moment of Impact". At the beginning of the show, they say something like "in a moment of impact, life can change...".  Last week, the story was one of a girl whose head got crushed between an elevator door and the wall - wiping her face and essentially crushing everybone in her skull. The story was of her amazing recovery. Her face is now... almost... normal. After years of surgery.   The week prior the show was of an athlete's busted knee. In a "moment of impact" all his life's work was gone. His life purpose had changed.     I just learned that my sister's mother in law had cancer. She recovered.      And I am obsessed with my weight. With cellulite, stretch marks, and a few extra kilograms.   Perspective.

      A terrorist group ambushed the house and killed its inhabitants...  The mother, a 34 year old social worker, was 8 months pregnant.  The four daughters were also killed: 11 year old, 9 year old, 7 year old and the 2 year old baby girl.   You won't read about it on the fornt page of the CNN site. Because it's such a "small" and mudane occurance in our country. "Only" 5 dead - even if it's a pregnant woman and four little girls....  And still - it IS home. It's STILL home.

      My mom sounded like she had won the lottery - yelling and singing on the phone. It took me a few minutes to understand what the craziness was all about.  We won. Maccabi (basketball team) won the European League.   It was after midnight in Israel but listening to the Israeli radio (through the magic of modern internet) the party was just beginning.  As if we had won some war threatening to destroy our country. As if we had just been awarded the promise of peace everlasting.   Just a basketball game. I guess we really are thirsty for some wins and for some good news.  We're crazy - I think to myself, listening to the radio describing the scenes in Tel-Aviv's park.   But here a I am, thousands of miles away, in my comfortable Bay Area apartment, with all the luxuries one could ask for, and the best TV shows a click away on the remote... wishing I could be back there with the crowds yelling, or at least watching the TV with my Mom and dancing around, wishing I could be....  back HOME.   (My best friend keeps asking why I would want to go back to a place here terror is an everyday reality, the economical situation is worse than anywhere in the US, the weather is pretty terrible all year, my career prospects are sad, etc etc.  This is why. Because of the dancing in the streets when Maccabi wins the Euroleague.  Because there is where I belong to the madness).

      $680.  This was the cost of a single University course at the Open University of Israel.  I thought I would take one course, to start with...   After all - a "smart girl like me" should finish her degree, right? Especially after having already invested 2 years fo hard work, right?  "This will be so easy for you", "you were such a good student", "you got the highest grades without even trying"...  Well, the cost was not just $680.  It was the tryig to focus on academic material at the end of a work day and the inadequacy of not being able to concetrate or understand the exercises. It was the disappointment in my husband's tone when he ended up doing the exercises for me.   I woke up in the morning with a leaden feeling and went to sleep with it at night - knowing the exercise is late (there's a word for it in Hebrew : מועקה that can't really be translated properly to English).   So to make a long stroy short. I QUJIT.  I dropped out. I failed. I gave up.   Do I feel bad?  I disappointed my parents, my sister, my brother, most of my friends, my husband...  I should feel like a failure.   But all I feel is.. relief. RELIEF!!!!!!!!!!

      The BOOT!  If you've been a reader for more than a few weeks, you may recall my complete and utter disgust with our incompetent new (well, not so new anymore) SE.  I have  urlLink vented   and  urlLink cursed   to anyone that was willing (or unwilling) to listen. I've probably spent more nights in my husband arms complaining of Harry than I have making love (oh well, that's  urlLink not really an accomplishment , is it?)  Anyway - "Harry" is gone. Booted. Shown the door. Kicked out. Fired. (Well, to be accurate, he doesn't actually know yet - but the decision has been made. You, dear readers, have the inside scoop!).

       To dream the impossible dream,  to fight the unbeatable foe,  to bear with unbearable sorrow,  to run where the brave dare not go...   To right the unrightable wrong,  to love pure and chaste from afar,  to try when your arms are too weary  to reach the unreachable star   Some days are filled with hope and courage. You suddenly have the strength to run faster, aim higher, think bigger.  Those days are few and far between.  Sometimes I think such days are preemptively given to us to recharge and revitalize. It's as if G-d (or fate) gives us the "glasses of naivete" and the bliss of ignorance for one day and allow us to believe that  we can .   Today has been one of such days.

      On my road to self improvement, I had purchased a highly recommended CD program that would, supposedly, improve my vocabulary and infuse my sentences with "power words" that would "make me sound like a Harvard Graduate". Needless to say, the program did not work - despite my futile attempts to incorporate the words into my daily business conversations.  You can hardly fit the word "capricious" or "sedentary" into a discussion on the benefits of mobile software and the sales negotiations that are my daily routine. Even more frustrating is the fact that the majority of the words in the CD are not even minimally challenging (come on, do I need a CD to teach me the words "struggle" or "negotiate"??!?).  I fell for the marketing hype.   I should have learned how to  golf  instead!    Update:  Here is a new approach. I'm recruiting you, my loyal readers, to my quest for a better vocabulary. Know of a "power" words/word I should be using? Let me know!!

      The sign in the Taxi said "Winner of the 1999 Pick Up contest", and made me smile.    First  - because of all the different interpretations of "Pick up" in this context (pick up of passengers, a clean-up contest, a dating competition, an morale boosting contest, etc.).    Second  - because it reminded me of a young promiscuous girl who decided to see how many guys she could "pick up" and make fall for her, and then tallied the score every night in a pink notebook.   How far does that seem today.  How different I turned out than what I had imagined in those days.

      The storyline is sickeningly naive. Sacharine sweet, sadly predictable. Boring, really.  But it's the music that is captivating me. Cuban music, latin beat. My music. Bam, bam, bam... bam, bam, bara bara baaam.... I'm in an airplane (again) filled with business people (stiffs) and nobody is watching the movie. And me?  I am barely held in my seat by the seatbelt, the beat of the latin music carrying me, moving my hips to the rythm in the small confines of the airplane chair, and dancing away in my mind to  days long ago and  lands far away .

      Did you know that the back seat of a police car has square plastic & metal seats - and the doors have no handles on them?   I would rather not know this information, but I just had the "pleasure" of being driven by the police, in the back seat. I also had the pleasure of being placed in handcuffs - and not as part of any sexual game. It sounds funny when I write all this, but let me assure you - it was not funny at all. This was a scary and an unpleasant experience. I am still quite shaken... OK, let me start from the beginning.   My husband is not back from his business trip yet - he should be arriving in an hour or so.  I took the opportunity of an evening alone and went to the movies with a friend. We saw "Stepford Wives", had a nice time, and I was headed home.  I was ALMOST home when a police car behind me signaled me to stop. I did.   Before I continue, let me explain something about myself: I hate anything  that has to do with cars. I hate driving, to begin with, I hate getting gas, and I don't deal with anything car-related. Therefore it is my husband who handles car insurance, registration, etc.  Now, back to my ordeal.   The cop walks over to my car and asks me if I realize the registration is expired and has expired  more than a year ago . Obviously, I knew nothing about this. He asks for my registration forms (which took me 10 minutes to find, as my husband "hid" them behind the passenger seat) and my driver's license. Then asks me to stay in the car.  While he goes back to the police car to run checks on me, I wait.  When he comes back he informs me there are several problems:  A) The car registration has expired in mid-2003 (!) B) The address the car is registered for is not the same as the address I live in C) The address on my ID is not the address I told him when he asked where I live.   (There are perfectly good explanations for the address messes, but they are irrelevant to the story)   I explain my husband takes care of these things and I don't know much about it. They ask me to call him - but as luck has it: he is on the flight and inaccessible.  The bottom line is that because the registration has been expired for over 6 months - the car needs to be impounded. I am asked to get out of the car and stand on the sidewalk.  I am given a breath-analyzer to confirm I had not been drinking. (I haven't of course).  And my hands are placed in handcuffs.  The toll truck arrives to take the car - but the car must be searched first.  However, since the cop that stopped me was accompanied by a trainee (not a real cop) he is not allowed to search the car and leave me with no supervision.  He calls ANOTHER police car. After a while (during which I am still on the sidewalk, in hand cuffs) they arrive.  One cop is "guarding" me while the other two search my car (for weapons, drugs, who knows...).  Then they ask me to take what I want from the car (before the car is driven away) and put it on the sidewalk.  I gather my things from the car - my Jacket, CD's, umbrella, icepack for my back, a few other items. They are all on the sidewalk.   By this time cars are slowing down to see what the commotion is all about (After all, two police cars, one toll truck, 4 police officers, a car with all doors open, stuff on the floor, and a young girl in handcuffs is quite a scene).   The car is taken away and the police begin filling out paperwork. When they are done they ask if I have someone to pick me up and take me home.  I have no one to call. No one to call.  nobody . Alone.  They offer to call me a cab and I muster the nerve to ask them if they can take me home. By now, I am so shaken and I can't control the tears streaming down my cheeks (even though I keep talking as if the person crying is a completely different person then the one talking).  I gather my belongings in a big black garbage bag - feeling like a criminal or a bum. I get in the backseat of the police car (harsh metal seats) and am driven home.   So here I am now. Still with no one to call I fall back on the one person I can call anytime: Mom. I call her in Israel and tell here my story between sobs. While she was quite understanding she also laughed quite a bit. She thinks all of this is quite hilarious. I might feel the same way tomorrow, but tonight - I am having a hard time laughing.

      Men - boyfriends, husbands, or just guys wanting to impress you - always tell you you look beautiful without make up.  "You're beautiful just the way you are. You really don't need make up. In fact, you're more beautiful without it".  I always thought this was just a bunch of BS they were using to get to our hearts (who doesn't like to hear she's pretty). Now I have proof:                  Now  do you understand why I put makeup on when I go out to throw the trash?

      Several months ago, somebody pointed out a bumper sticker on a license plate - black with a blue strip running horizontally through it, and asked me if I'd seen that before. I hadn't. Since then, I see them everywhere. It's like an alien invasion or some cult taking over. I had never noticed them until somebody pointed them out.   I didn't know anything about weblogs until a couple of months ago - pretty surprising as I considered myself quite internet-savvy. Yet, I had never heard the term or read a Blog. Then a friend sent me a link to his own blog, then another and another. Then I started my own. Now, everywhere I turn there are blogs. People seem to be talking about them everywhere. Time magazine had an article about Blogs. So did another magazine (the name escapes me right now - I'll get back to you on this). A friend I know started working for a company providing tools to consolidate blogs (bloglines.com). They are everywhere. And I never noticed them until someone had pointed them out.   I wonder what other phenomena I am still in the dark about.

      There were six of us - young women, in our  late twenties: celebrating G's birthday at a restaurant. Spirits were high.  If I were to look at our table from a distance, or evesdrop on our conversation, it would have resembled a variation on a scene from "Sex in the City".  "So, what is the definition of dating? If you go on two dates but don't have a third one set up - are you dating?" "Guys like the damsel in distress, you should let him show you this, explain that, feel like he is helping you" "This woman on craigslist wrote that she and her husband have sex 10-12 times a week and asked whether it was normal" (gasps and laughter).  Eating, laughing, sharing funny stories (of course, I must have mentioned my blog at least 10 times, being the addict that I am).    [I don't remember having this much fun or feeling this comfortable with female friends growing up. I guess now that I am, ahem, an adult - and happily married too - that competitive nature of mine is no longer in the way of enjoying the company of girls. I wish I had discovered this sooner...]    Our waiter was the epitome of Mr. I'm-A-Smooth-Operator-But-Am-So-cute-I-Can-Pull-It-Off-Without-Seeming-Like-An-Ass type of guy. extremely good looking, sweet, funny - a true gem. Right away we ambush him: "Are you single" (yes) "How old are you" (31) "What do you do" (Sing, work at the restaurant) And so on. His last name is Kid. First name is Rodney. It took me a few minutes to get the joke. Rodney Kid. Rod - NeyKid. Rod Naked. Smiles, laughs, innuendos.   Mr. Naked is taken with J. He tells her she's pretty. Then he tells her again. And again. He thinks she is beautiful.  We play out the game for them - write J's number on his notepad. Make him promise he will call her and take her out. He does.  Whenever he stops by - he's got another cute flirt for her up his sleeve. We embarrass her a little bit, and him a little bit - but it's all good.  He will call her and they will go out.   Just like that, without too much preparation, or expectations - J has a date with an oh-so-hot guy.  I watch this courting process from a spectators perspective and think to myself: Would I still want to be there? Am I jealous?  I think about this on the ride home and realize, as fun as that seemed, and as flattering as this was for J, and as exciting as the dating game can be - I am lucky to have it in the past.  It's the means to an end . Sure - the "means" can be fun and have a great body - but the "end" is going to bed at night and feeling loved and safe and never being alone and sharing your heart and loving with all you can love.  And the end beats the means. Hands down.  And yet, as much as I truly mean everything I had just written, I wouldn't oppose some Mr. Naked telling me I am pretty every now and then :-)   I'll be waiting to hear if J's date with Mr. Naked turns out to be a really great "means" with a quick end, or the real, ever-desired "end". To be continued...

      The A/C at Atlanta airport is not working. Humidity is high, it's hot, and everybody is cranky - myself included.  My flight to San Jose (Delta Airlines) is overbooked. 15 people have no seats available. Three of them upgrade to first class for $150. Ten of them are offered to take the flight leaving tomorrow morning - Delta will cover their hotel.  2 are offered nothing. The fare they paid for the flight was too low - making them second class (actually class T) passengers. They don't get to fly today. They don't get a hotel. They can't upgrade for $150. Only option is to stay (on their dollars) overnight - fly tomorrow. Or buy the only first class ticket left on the flight - at full price - $1400.  Guess what group I am in? You're right. I'm one of the two.  After several calls to my boss he instructs me to buy the last 1st class seat - I am needed at the office tomorrow.  The other gentlemen in the same predicament also wants to buy the ticket. We fight over it.  I run back and forth between the gate and the ticket counter (you guessed it - two different sides of the terminal. Who said I am not exercising enough?).  He offers $2000 for the ticket (what is this? Ebay?). The battle rages.   The process above took place in the span of 2 hours. Two hours of arguing, running back and forth through the terminal, dealing with some seriously stupid agents with no IQ and even less compassion. It's hot, I'm cranky and I look like shit (Wrinkled suit, no make up, frizzy hair.. Ugh).   As I am dashing to the freakin' gate for the umpteenth time - a gentleman stops me apologetically. Tall, handsome, well dressed. I think he is going to tell me I dropped something. I've been dropping my stuff all over the terminal. Then the weirdest thing happens. He asks me "Are you married?". I am so stumped I don't really understand where the question comes from - never guessing this guy is hitting on me. "Yes, I am" I answer curtly. Disappointed look on his face, he says "Ugh. I was going to get some coffee and... oh well. I hope the rest of your day is better" (he's heard my not-so-quiet discussion with the agents). "Oh - and you're beautiful".  "Thank you" I say, stunned.   I gotta run to get the ticket, I do, and I get it. I run again to get on the plane. I make it.  And now I sit back and recall tis strange interaction. It's been a long time since anyone has hit on me. A bad day can turn not-so-bad with a single compliment.

      Salesforce.com - they made it. The stock is soaring.  No excuses - not the economy, not the market.  It's about the team you have on board. Both the Management  and  the ranks.  We could have been there today, or at least closer today - and despite my lack of a formal education, despite my minimal managerial experience, despite my inability to see (perhaps) the whole picture - I can pinpoint the crossroads where the wrong path was taken.  I can pinpoint the people responsible for downfalls. And I can see history repeating itself with the same people driving our future.  It will get worse before it gets better.

      The movie was a classic, corny-yet-well-made hollywood film called "Miracle", about the US hockey team winning the gold in the Olympics back in the 70's.   I do not follow sports of any kind, certainly not hockey. And I am not the type to get caught up in the emotions of the game - I don't relate to it. I've never been on a team (unless you cound "the band" in high school).  And yet, this film, on a late night flight back home has got me emotional.   (Strange, how I am always emotional on dark, long flights...)   Emotion:   I was jealous of the camaraderie in that hockey team. That one for all and all for one bond. I've don't think I've ever experienced anything like that - except maybe with my family - but that is different. I'd like to know what that feels like.   Emotion:   I want to win something. I need to win something. An achievement to propel me and invigorate me. A trophy of some sort - not necessarily materialistic - to prove something to the world and to myself. I need a win.   Emotion:   "Great moments come from great opportunity".  I am surrounded my them. Opportunities that is. How do I make great moments out of them?

      Same dumb magazine (Women's Health and Fitness).  Title of an article "Einstein must  of  exercised - a lot".   Now, I am not a native English speaker, and yet, even I know the phrase is "must  have " (not "must of"). I find it deplorable that a magazine will publish an article with such an obvious grammatical error - in the TITLE, no less.  How ironic that the article discusses intelligence, too.  Grammar errors in published media - my pet peeve.

      At a business meeting today, our partners and us are trying to sell a prospect on the benefits on our respective (and complementing) products. We are selling our mobile/wireless platform, our partners are selling their scheduling optimization software.  The salesguy from our partner company believes that one product has no value without the other. To illustrate it he used the following analogy, which I found hilarious:   - "I bought a great car!"  - "Really, which car?"  - "It's a cadilac! It's great, it's got leather seats, a really good sound system, great A/C.. The best!"  - "But you didn't buy any wheels!"  - "Who needs wheels? It's a  CAR ! Check out the sounds system! It's The best of it's kind! See the A/C? How cold the air is? I can just sit here and listen to my tunes, and chill out...it's all top of the line"  - "But you can't drive anywhere!?"  - "So what, it's the best car out there!"

      "I don't hate you personally. It's not your fault you were born Jewish".   This is what a Palestinian cab driver in Milwaukee told me once he established that I am Jewish (after listening in on a conversation with my mother in Hebrew).   It's not my FAULT I was born Jewish.

      No se porque me dio la gana de escribir este blog en Espanol. Ha pasado mucho tiempo desde ques escribo en lo que es mi "idioma natal".   Quizas sera que demasiados "amigos" ya saben de mi weblog y necesito otra forma de escribir aquelllas cosas que nisiquiera ellos puedan leer.  O quizas sera que a veces me hace falta esto - el escribir en una forma diferente y encontrar nuevas formas de expresarme.  O quizas pienso que haci habria algun chance que alguien de mi pasado se encuentre esta pagina.   Hay algo en este idioma que me cambia, que me pone en un estado mas romantico... emocional... apasionado. Sera mi sangre latina, o el caracter temperamental del idioma, o el hecho de que muchos de mis recuerdos ardientes tuvieron lugar con amantes latinos.  Sera lo que sera la razon - aqui estoy: En un aeropuerto en alguna esquina desconocida de los Estados Unidos.  Escribiendo en Espanol y pensando de mi pasado, de los homres que me han usado, y de todo lo que (yo pense) que habia olvidado.    Se llamaba Zvi Mirochnick.  Se enamoro de mi hace muchisimos anos. Es un cuento largo, que quizas un dia lo contare aqui, en esta pagina. Me mando un casette a Israel - algunas semanas despues de nuestro aventura amorosa en Chile. En el casette me hablo palabras de amor. Y me canto una cancion, mientras tocando la guitarra.  Han pasado  diez  anos. Y todaviao me acuerdo de la cancion.. casi desde el principio a su final...:    Amor de verdad  / Por Zvi Mirochnizk Siempre se piense, Siempre se imagina Nunca se entiende, nunce se logra creer En un ser ideal, solo para suenos Un ser para amar como siempre imagine.   No enamoramos en nuestros suenos Nos encontramos en mundo ideal  Cuando nos conocimos, ya nos amabamos Llendo despacio hacia un mundo especial  No fue necesario un preambulo comun No fue necesario el tiempo normal  Los hombres siempre buscan una pricensa azul  Siempre busan amor de cuentos en suenos de juventud Amor de verded, amor ideal Un amor imposible,  Un amor que muy pocos son capaces de alcanzar...  Algun dia encontrare ese cassette y lo convertire en MP3 para ponerlo aqui. Con su voz tan dulce, y su corazon tan puro - Zvi era el primer cuento de hadas de mi vida.    Ivan era otro cuento. Ya era adulta. Pero todavia tonta, pensando que siempre soy yo la que controlo la situacion.  Ivan me uso. Un dia les contare de el.

      Michael has once more translated my Hebrew poetry... (Should I be paying Michael?)    Guilt  / Translated by  urlLink Michael B. Smith   (Original can be found  urlLink here ).   When the father gives: the father is happy, the son is happy. When the son gives: the father cries, the son cries.    In those hours of the night  / Translated by  urlLink Michael B. Smith  with minor creative changes by myself for rhyming purposes. (Original can be found  urlLink here )  In those hours of the night, the hours very late ,  When it is quiet, With only the faint sound of the A/C,  They arise within me, all those thoughts&#8212; of forbidden trait&#8212;  And the repressed, numbed urge awakens within me.  And in those hours of the night, then, at last I have permission  to stop everything, and return to myself for a brief rite,  And from within arises a distant, hidden recollection,  Of everything that was - perhaps, and of all that happened - but not quite.  And then, in those hours, the true hours of the night, I want it so much, and it is hot and it's ablaze ,  And all the urges gush into those letters that I write,  And then morning comes again, and the urges go away.

      This was one of the times I wish I had a camera.   Knowing I had a busy morning schedule ahead, I brought a boiled egg and toast with me to work today - thinking I'd grab some breakfast bites between calls.  I get a break, I peel the egg's shell, I run to get a knife to cut the egg in half  (I was never allowed to just bite into a whole egg, as in Judasim, eating whole eggs is something that can only be done when in mourning. At any other occasion, the egg must be cut in half).   So I cut the egg in half, and lo and behold - my egg had two perfectly round yolks. Identical twins waiting to happen. What are the chances?  After a few pangs of guilt (over the twins, and over the double dose of cholesterol and calories) - I scarf the egg down.  No picture taken. Nothing but this story as proof.

      When I was young, I used to play this game,  urlLink Tetris .   I used to play it so much the images of the brick-like shapes falling down slowly got burned into my conscience. In bed at night, I'd close my eyes and see the shapes falling.. As hard as I tried, I couldn't get those shapes out of my head,   It's happening again. I'm obsessed.  Riding my car to work - I'm doing it in my head - blogging.  In the gym - blogging.  A funny conversation over lunch - blogging.  In bed - thinking of something blog worthy for tomorrow.   It's Tetris all over again...

      I was taught never to wish ill of someone else.  Even if that person was an enemy, my parents used to say, I should not wish him dead, or hurt or sick.   Yet I find myself, more often than not, engaging in the somewhat childish act of wishing a certain person (we'll call him Ralph) terrible illnesses and a gruesome death.   This Ralph person has made my family's life a living hell for the past several years.  I could write a book about the things he'd done. The book would become an instant best seller. Ralph would be arrested and probably jailed. (Not a bad idea, I might share some horrid juicy details of Ralph's wrongdoings in some other blog. I am too furious to do it now).   So yes, it is probably immature. It may be sadistic and it may be against the morals I have been taught.  But I do. I wish him dead. I wish him in pain.   And in lieu of a more physical action I could take, I found  urlLink this   to vent my anger on.  Didn&rsquo;t help much, I must admit.

      Driving back from a long weekend trip, A few hours on the road, several hours ahead.  The sun was beginning to set (or maybe it just seemed like it), my husband was dozing off on the seat next to mine, and I was (uncharacteristically) at the wheel.  Our ipod playing songs, shuffled from a playlist.   And then,    this song   comes on.  ימים של שקט (Days of tranquility)   I listen to the harmony playing, hear the steady breaths of my husband, and I am...soothed.  And I suddenly believe - they are coming. Days of tranquility.

       (Dreamt on June 10th, 2004 - told as best as I can remember it, and despite the fact it does not make much sense)    Scene 1: Claudia's scene  ..."But Claudia, we've been best friends for years, it never bothered you that I am Jewish!" My friend and I have been caught, and tomorrow we will be sent to the Jewish camps. The night is falling, and our fear is growing. I am begging my best friend, Claudia, to save my friend and I. Begging her to hide us.  Claudia says she can't help us. I see sorrow in her eyes, but nothing in her words backs it up.  Tomorrow we will be sent to the Jewish camp.    Scene 2: Conversion kit  It's morning, and my friend and I are on the banks of the river, about to be sent away on a boat. Claudia appears, running.  "I'm going to save you!", she says. My heart stops.  She takes out a kit. A "conversion kit" of sorts. All you have to do is covert. Here's the kit. You'll be safe.  "I can't" I say. "But, Ady, it's your only way!?"... "I can't".    Scene 3 Sent on the river  My friend and I are in a small rubber boat. Our hands are tied with little plastic ropes to the boat and to each other. People wave us off, and the boat is carried on the fast stream and into a building. The river flows through the corridors of the building. There's a damp smell in the air.  We manage to wiggle out of the plastic restraints and off the boat into the water. We tumble with the stream holding on to each other.    Scene 4:  The storage closet  There's a small door in the cement wall - we swim towards it. Climb in. It's a small, dark storage closet of sorts. There are brooms and cleaning supplies and very little room for the both of us. We sit it the closet trying to catch our breath.  My friend takes out her cell phone and calls her parents, to let them know she is OK. As she speaks, we hear footsteps. Somebody is approaching the closet. I hush my friend and slam her phone shut.  The door to the closet opens a crack and a large hand is seen. It retrieves a can from the closet, and does not see us.  We are safe for now.    Scene 5: The lady in the parking lot   There a tiny crack in the closet wall. I peer outside through the crack and see a parking lot. We are located between two levels of the parking lot, but not to high to jump out.  Every now and then somebody walks through and gets in the car, and drives away. They don't notice us or the crack.  An elegant lady is speaking to a fine looking man. They shake hands and he climbs in the car.  She walks towards the crack in the wall, towards us. She seems kind and is smiling.   "I can help you" she whispers to us. "Do you need a bed to sleep in and hide tonight?" We nod, and she helps us climb down and into the parking lot. She seems kind.    Scene 6: Cheese to sugar  "I will need Jewish foods", she says. "Did you see any in the closet"?  We nod, "There was some Jewish cheese in there", I say. "Great", she replies. "Climb up and get it. I will use it to make brown sugar".  I go up and get it for her.  "Great, follow me.", she motions. We start walking.    Scene 7: The people in the woods  We follow her to the woods. My friend is told to wait behind.   As I follow the kind lady, we arrive at a clearing in the woods. There's an area for cooking, and a large are for picnicing. I look around and suddenly notice dozens of people.  They are tied to the tables and chairs, to each other, to the trees. Their faces are streaked with tears. Their clothes torn. Some are bloodied. All have terrified looks on their faces.  A bolt of realizations shoot through me.  The lady looks back at me and says "I had to tie them, for their own good. It's the only way to educate them".  I nod and keep walking.  I look back at the people. Many of them are rubbing their hands together frantically. Rubbing, rubbing.   "Um..." I say. "Can I go wash my hands before we eat"?  "Sure", She replies. "The sinks are right over there, behind those trees.". I start walking towards the trees. And then I start running. Running. Running. Running!!!! Running!!!!    It's been four days since this dream and I still remember it vividly (The only other dream I remember this vividly is one I used to dream in kindergarten, over and over, every night for several months. I will have to write it here some other day)...

      He is going to say "I told you so. She is not ready to be a sales person. And now we are paying the price".  And they will nod and believe they made the wrong decision.   And maybe they have. Maybe I wasn't ready. Maybe my ego, my convicing self-confidence, or some would say arrogance, were stronger than my skills. They certainly were stronger than my expertise.   After all,  real  salespeople don't cry when they lose a deal, right?

      Do you know that feeling, when you get bad news - and the world suddenly stops for a minute...? And then, that numbness trying to understand what you've heard, what went wrong.    [OK - I may be a tad too melodramatic here....]   I lost a deal. THE deal.  The big one I had been working on for the past God-know-how-many months. $350K.  Finally establishing myself as a sales person in this company, not just a youg wannabe.  Being the only salesperson to hit their quota.  All down the drain.  I don't quite understand why, yet. Don't know where the mistake was made or by whom.  And yet - there it was - my boss knocking on my door saying: The deal is lost. It's not going to happen.  (They didn't even call me. Instead they called my boss).   "You win some, you lose some", my father always says.   Today I chalked a loss.    Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.  Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)    Win as if you were used to it, lose as if you enjoyed it for a change.

        יש לפעמים תחושה של סיום והיד מושטת ללחיצה והיד כבדה כמו הלב  ואני חושבת לעצמי ש אם מישהו היה מצייר את זה אז היה מצייר טקס עם דפים שחורים ואותיות לבנות ושקט מוחלט.

      On TV today, a father told his daughter "sometime you're the hammer, sometimes you're the nail", then "today I'm the nail, you be the hammer".   My parents have been the nail for the past decade. Taking one blow after the other.  I have been the hammer for a while now - the shoulder, the ears, the bank.   My sister has always been the nail, even when there was no real reason, and sometimes when there was.  I have been the hammer - when she cries, when she screams, when she breaks.   My little brother is a hammer in the making, but being young - I'll always think of him as the nail.    -- Alternative ending --   I wanted to end this blog with a sentence depicting the fact I am tried. Burned out (hence the title) of being the hammer for everybody. But as I was typing, I realized that is not entirely true.   My wedding brought a bigger hammer into my life. A 5 kg pound hammer to my flimsy 1 kg.  I can now rest, and let my husband be my hammer and theirs.      I forget the exact wording... But it's something like:    G-d only gives you what you can handle.

      I used to know a guy named Tomer. Not closely, not intimately. But I knew his name and his face and we shared a few night-shifts in the army. I am not a part of his life and he is not a part of mine. And I really don't know much about him, except remembering I used to think he was pretty smart.   Today I read about him on a friend's blog. They made a movie.   I watch it over and over and it makes me feel sad. But theres also something romantic about it.  Bottom line - it made me feel. And that's what counts.    urlLink Here it is

      My favorite part of writing this blog (or any other written piece, actually) is the titles.  Condensing the gist of the post, the punchline, the pain - in one or two words.   My favorite artist, a painter called Hilary Eddy always chooses the perfect names for her drawings.  This picture is titled "Sighs and Whispers". Perfect, isn't it?      [This picture makes me want to blow at it, softly, and see the petals sway away. Exhale.]

      Many of my recent posts have been about family - dads, siblings, grandparents, babies.  What does that mean? What does it say about me?  Is this that maternal instinct I keep insisting I don't have?

      His dad was diagnosed with lymphoma.  I'm not supposed to know.  His dad had some episode last week. Something serious.  I'm not supposed to know.  His dad is going through biopsies and treatments and I am not supposed to know.  But I do. I know.  And theres nothing I can do - can't hug, can't pat him on the shoulder, can't let him just talk.  But I know.

      He is a family son. The only one of us who regularly visits our grandfather, cares for him, both physically and emotionally. He's a good boy.   He recently returned from a long trip overseas, and was catching up with friends. He hasn't seen them in 4 months. It was a happy reunion. Noisy.   Then he receives the call. My grandfather is on the other side - out of breath, almost out of his mind, crying. He is feeling terrible, worse than he's ever felt - he says. He is dying. Please come. Fast. Fast. He is dying.   I can only imagine the next minutes. The good grandson dropping everything, dashing to the car. Speeding through stop lights, heart beating fast, hands shaking. Bursts into the small apartment, runs into the bedroom.   My grandfather is sitting in his bed. Still alive (well, as alive as he'd been for the last few years). He's had a nightmare.  He just had a nightmare.

         בשעות האלה של הלילה   בשעות האלה של הלילה, המאוחרות כששקט, ורק קול מזגן עמום -  עולות בי כל המחשבות ההן, האסורות, ומתעורר בי היצר המודחק, הרדום.  ובשעות האלה של הלילה, אז סוף סוף מותר להפסיק הכול ולחזור אליי קצת, ומתוך תוכי עולה זכרון רחוק, מוסתר של כל מה שהיה - אולי, וכל מה שקרה - כמעט.  ואז, בשעות האלה של הלילה, האמיתיות,  אני כל כך רוצה, וזה בוער וחם וכל היצרים זורמים אל תוך אותן האותיות ואז הבוקר שוב עולה, והיצר שוב נרדם.

          "אה, טוניה, " לחש מרגוליס הנבעת, "את מטורפת? בצהרי היום? בעלך יהרוג אותי." והוא הדף אותה מעליו בתקיפות, הושיב אותה על כסא וכיבד אותה בדבש. "למה בכפית, חיים? למה לא כמו פעם?" התחטאה טוניה.  "את ראית את הסוד הגדול ביותר שלי," אמר מרגוליס בחיוך של התעלמות, "את פיוס המלכות". טוניה ניסתה להשיב את פיוסם שלהם למרכז השיחה אבל מרגוליס הביט בה בתכלת עיניו התמה ולא חדל לדבר.  "בכל כוורת יש רק מלכה-אם אחת," הרצה, "זהו חוק בל יעבור. היא הקובעת את מספר הדבורים. לקראת פריחת האביב דרושות לי כמה שיותר פועלות." "אתה מדבר כמו קפיטליסט," חייכה טוניה מבעד לדמעותיה, אבל מרגוליס לא שעה להלצותיה ולעצבונה. "אני ממתין לבקיעתן של המלכות החדשות," המשיך, "וכשאלו מסתערות זו על זו, אני מפריד ביניהן, בקיסם, לאט-לאט, בהרבה סבלנות, עד שנמאס להן לריב והן מוכנות לחיות ולהטיל יחד באותה כוורת. ככה יש לי פי שניים פועלות ופי שניים דבש. את העדפת אותו טוניה, ועכשיו תאכלי את מה שבישלת." "אבל מה זה שייך, חיים?" היא מילמלה, סוגרת ברכות את שפתיה על הברות שמו, מהרהרת באצבעות הדבש שלו, "בשביל מה אתה מספר לי על הדבורם האלה?" אבל מרגוליס כבר שב אל המלכות הניצות, ובסבלנות אין קץ הרחיק את האמהות הרצחניות זו מזו, לואט מילים מרגיעות, וטוניה יצאה מהצריף, חמקה שוב דרך המטע של יעקובי, ותחת השמיים המרוקעים פח אפור, שמעה רק את יפחותיה החנוקות ואת מגפיה...."     מתוך "רומן רוסי", מאיר שלו

        Now I know how the river feels, when it reaches the sea It finally finds the place it was always meant to be Holding fast, home at last, knowing the journey is through,  Lying here with you - I know how the river feels...   The night has slowly rolled in, these lyrics play sweetly  and I cautiously allow myself to drift... To float to safety...

      Wake up every morning. Brush your teeth, paint your face on.  Walk into the office, greet your coworkers brightly and cheerfully: "G'morning!" Have a cup of coffee or tea, catch up on email, make a few calls.  Type type type. Talk talk talk.  Go to lunch.  Chat about last night's episode on TV... bla bla bla. yada yada yada.  Drive home.  Eat. Sleep. Repeat.    Only rarely does one feel truly alive.  It's that moment of clarity when routine is broken and emotion is awakened.  Be it breaking the rule, or crossing a line, or making one hurt, or drown in pleasure. It's those moments of insanity that truly keep me sane.

      My sister works at a bank. At this bank you are either a temporary worker or a permanent one. If you are a temporary worker, you have no rights. You can be fired for any reason, you can be fired if you're pregnant (against the law in Israel for regular employees, but always the case at these banks - if you're temporary), you get no insurance.  You can't be a temporary worker for more than 18 months. At the end of this period, you either become a permanent employee (which brings security, higher pay, better terms) or get fired.   My sister wants to have a second baby, but without a second income (hers, in addition to her husbands) she can't afford another child. (The average cost of a child in Israel is 3000 NIS per month).   So my sister waits until the 18 months pass, to become a permanent employee. So she can get pregnant without being fired. So she can count on an income.  Today - 16 months have gone by and my sister had her Review. My sister will not become a permanent employee.  This means she will be fired within 2 months.  This means she can't have a baby.     My little brother likes to keep his life private, and hates it when we worry about him. After all, he is not so little anymore.  He calls us, his "four mothers" (As in the Four Mothers from the bible) - My grandmother (who lives with my folks), My mom, My sister, and I.  He discovered a mole on his thigh that was growing large and dark.  He secretly went to see a dermatologist yesterday.  The dermatologist said the mole looks dangerous and should be removed immediately. He scheduled surgery for the following day (today).  My brother went to the procedure alone. He didn't tell anyone. He had the mole removed, 3 stitches placed, and the mole was sent for a biopsy. The dermatologist told him it didn't look "friendly".  We wouldn't have found out at all, had my grandmother not noticed the bandage on his leg when he returned.  Results will come in a week.     My uncle is a sick man. He is overweight, is manic depressive and on medication, and is very diabetic.  He lost his mind and his soul many many years ago and leads a miserable life.  Today he found out he also has skin cancer. He probably won't live much longer.     I got my first P.O. (Purchase Order) today. $140,000. The first deal I closed on my own.  I have waited for this for months. Thought I'd be happy.  Instead - I've spent my day in gloom.

      I usually don't tell people of software I have installed on my computer - mostly because I treat my computer as somewhat of a prostitute - forever installing and uninstalling freeware, shareware and stolen software.  This one, though, I had to share. It's free, it's legal, it's unlimited and it's actually a great productivity tool.  It's a search and indexing add-on, fully integrated with Outlook, just recently released by Microsoft after their acquisition of the company that developed this tool.  If you have  urlLink Gmail , you know how great an add-on like this can be...  urlLink Enjoy !

      It's incredible to me, how we (humans, women) are pre-programmed to react in a certain manner to certain words - even if we know, rationally, that we are being manipulated.  George Michael says (sings) in one of his songs: "And I know all the games you play, because I play them too..." Interestingly enough,  knowing  the game, does not necessarily mean not falling for the game.   "Is that your natural eye color? Your eyes are so beautiful"...   The equivalent of "Have you been working out?".  Cliche. Corny. Predictable.  And yet - I fell for it. I fall for it every time. I'd fall for it again, given the chance.  I, robot.

      A friend once asked me: "But how did you  know ? That this was  it , that this was your  true love , your  soulmate ...?... Do you "just know"?   Not all the time. You don't "know it" every living moment, every time you meet or kiss. Sometimes it feels like routine. Feels like inertia. Sometimes you doubt. But certain moments... Certain moments are so real, so deep, so true - and these moments cement that feeling in you - and then you know. And those certain moments carry you through the banalities of the day to day life and the routine, and the ups and downs and turmoils.   I had one of such fleeting moments today. Nothing in particular happened. But I had one of these moments where I looked at my husband, and I felt my heart swell so large and so full, and I just knew he is my soulmate and there is no one on earth I would rather be with.And I fell in love all over again - with his kindness, and sense of humour, and wit. And I felt blessed to have found him, and for an instant thanked god for my luck.   That moment is over, my heart is back to it's original size, and my day continued on - just as usual. But I felt obliged to commemorate this in writing, so that one day, when temptations rise, or when a battle ensues, I can read back on this and remember - I know. I do. I love.

      I've never done these on my blog before, and yes, I agree, they are kind of lame.  but it's Sunday morning, I found this on someone else's blog, and decide to be a a copycat (again).  I promise this won't happen very frequently.  Here we go:   1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says.  "I had spent my youth traveling with a band of itinerant goliards, given to them at a young age when my mother died."   2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  Other side of the couch.   3. What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Law and Order, Criminal Intent   4. WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what time it is. 9:15 AM   5. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time? 9:22 AM   6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? Birds in the tree outside our living door window   7. When did you last step outside? What were you doing? Yesterday. Came back from a movie.   8. Before you came to this website, what did you look at? Statistics of hits on my web site.   9. What are you wearing? PJ Tshirt, panties   10. Did you dream last night? Yes   11. When did you last laugh? Yesterday   12. What is on the walls of the room you are in? An oil painting painted on a canvas fan.   13. Seen anything weird lately? Nothing that comes to mind right now.   14. What do you think of this quiz? Egh.   15. What is the last film you saw? In a movie theater? I, Robot.   16. If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first? Pay off all my parents debts. An apartment in Israel. A house in the USA. An apartment for my brother. A university diploma :-)   17. Tell me something about you that I don't know.  I am more sinner than saint.   18. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Cliche - but I would make peace. If that's too much - then at least peace in Israel. Still too much? Then peace amongst the different Jewish sects.   19. Do you like to dance? More than anything.   20. George Bush: Is he a power-crazy nutcase or someone who is finally doing something that needed to be done for years? I would say neither, but if I had to chose it would be closer to the latter.   21. Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her? Noy.   22. Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him? Ariel.   23. Would you ever consider living abroad? I am living abroad. And If I wasn't - yes. But only temporarily. I would always come back home.

      Watched the movie yesterday. A single scene remained etched in my mind.  The detective is interrogating the robot. In trying to prove the robot will never be human, the detective asks him:  "Can you compose a symphony? Can you take this paper and draw a masterpiece?". The robot doesn't hesitate and spits back to the detective: "Can you?"....   Can I? Isn't that what make us truly amazing - the ability to create art, out of thin air - not out of imitation, not out of taught practices - but out of creativity and emotion?  .... Can I?

      Another reality show to be addicted to. Producers are running out of ideas and have been recently creating new shows that are combination of previous shows... This latest "merged" show is  urlLink Studio 7 . A combination of a trivita type show (general knowledge questions, IQ tests, etc) and a big brother (contenstants live together, form alliances, etc). Not bad at all.  And here I was, thinking I was weaned off reality TV. It's hard to be a recovering Reality TV show addict in the USA.   P.S. And you probably thought this post would be about sexual temptations, right? Not this time :-)

      This week, on Jay Leno's headlines segment, he read the following piece, which was taken from a real newspaper (I forget where). I found it so funny I just had it post it here, for your enjoyment.    Q.  I was a witness in court and got sworn in. They told me I was under oath, after I was sworn in, but I never de-oathed, or un-oathed, or whatever. My girlfriend told me they had to remove the oath before I am safe again. So am I still under oath, or does it wear off, or what?  Hilarious!

      I had the chance today to see an email that I was not meant to see.  It's always interesting to learn what other people think of you... Truly...   This man I know (Man  A) wrote an email to his friend (Man  B) telling him about me (what I do, where I live, what I look like, etc). I still don't know how that email thread came about (or why the hell would Man B even be interested to know these details about me). Well, Man B sent an email to a close girl friend of mine, asking her if she knew me and could tell him a little bit more about me. In doing this, he actually forwarded the original email (from Man A) to her. From there, the path into my inbox was short.  The majority of the email was, surprisingly enough, pretty accurate - even the negative comments. One sentence there, threw me off: "Looks: For me, I would consider her 8.5. You would probably say she is a 6.5 or 7".   They are  grading  us now?  A Six or Seven?  Why would I get one grade from one man, then another form another man?   And why do I even care?

      Sometime last year, I was invited to a "Pleasure Party" by a friend. I'd never been to one, and wasn't very sure of what they were.  It ended up being a "sales" meeting, where an acquaintance was selling different "pleasure products" (yes, sex toys, vibrators, creams, and products of the like) in a home setting. Very similar to the "pyramid marketing" scenarios, where women sell  urlLink Tupperware . I went there, saw some demonstrations of the toys, and yes - even bought some who served me faithfully until they broke (!!), and made a few friends (who luckily lasted longer than my purchases).   That is why I was surprised to read  urlLink this , today.   Here we are, in the land of the freedom... and selling sexual toys can be considered a "criminal obscenity"? What's next - being charged for possession of these toys? Oh well, at least the charges were dropped.

      It's a risk, we bloggers take - and I guess it's part of the appeal of being a blogger - the risk of discovery.  My blog started as an anonymous one - one of my best kept secrets. Only strangers were allowed to venture into my sporadic vent-fests.  Then, one by one, close friends were let in, always after serious consideration and risk calculations: each friend imposing a new set of limitations on the contents of my blog.  Once these familiar faces began to roam the pages of my true self - new precaution measures had to be taken - the use of different languages in my blog, my secret "back door", and others.  But all the security measures in the world are not enough when one has a big mouth. And as  urlLink I have said in the past , I I was never too good at keeping my mouth shut.  Well, one of my colleagues was wise enough to put one and one together and found my blog. I am now an open book to one more person.   Welcome to my blog, Leon  (if you ever find the courage to come back here, now that you know I can track the hits on my blog).   For a short while, this door will remain ajar for you and other onlookers to peek in. Until I figure out a way to host my musings somewhere else, think of a new and improved security measure (ideas, anyone???) or just start a new, even more private Blog (until I give that one away, too).   Don't forget to wipe your feet before you step in.

      I was drawn into an argument today without meaning to.  Apparently, I offended my colleague, Leon, (yes, the same Leon from  urlLink my airport story ) with my comments (or ignorance) on Communism in China and whether or not religion can be practiced there.  While the contents of the argument merit a post of their own - as it certainly is an interesting subject that I know way too little of - I feel compelled to write about  how   the discussion was held and how it deteriorated (as opposed to  what  the discussion was about).   The discussion began by Leon's mentioning of a certain fact, which I then questioned. My questioning the facts were not an attempt to disqualify what Leon was saying or to judge him in any way - but rather as an honest expression of wonder at the fact itself. In my mind, this was said (or meant to be said) in astonishment, or in marvel - as that fact negated what I had heard (or thought I heard) before.   And Leon was offended. As a result, he snapped back at me, angry that I doubted his knowledge in the matter (which is undoubtedly more than mine as he himself has been in China and is married to a Chinese girl, while I know nothing of this matter), and the discussion that ensued was strained, to put it mildly.   I am not worried about where this leaves Leon and I - eventually, I made my intentions clear and we got back on track. But this incident has left me with some troubling thoughts: How is it possible, that in some cultures (Israel, Venezuela) people think of me as a most tactful person, so diplomatic - in fact - that I am always brought in to arbitrate arguments or represent matters objectively, while others (USA) I always seem to get into trouble for being tactless without the slightest intention?   Is it my choice of words? My tone? Is it my body language?   I understand that a sentence such as "Oh really?" can be interpreted in many ways - depending on context and tone. It can be casting a doubt on the legitimacy of something, it can be wonder and and awe, etc.. Could it be that the same exact tone means one thing to Americans and another to Israelis or Venezuelans?

      No, not tomatoes. Actually - believe it or not - Hair.  Yes, green fried  hair  is what I am forced to live with now.   It began three weeks ago, at a late night in a hotel room. I couldn't fall asleep and was watching late night commercials, knowing I had to get up way too early in the morning and  shower and blow dry my hair. Then a commercial came on... For " urlLink EasyStraight " hair straightening system. I am not dumb and I know these products are not worth a dime, and yet - I went online and bought it thinking - what's the worst that could happen? It won't work! But if it does, I'll have straight hair and won't have to blow dry it every morning...  Wrong. The worst that can happen is that the chemicals fry your hair - turning it into parched, unmanageable, straw-like strands  that can not be repaired.  I can not shave my head (believe it or not - been there, done that). So for now, I'll have to stick to deep dry conditioning and ponytails until  my hair grows back out.   The price we pay for vanity....  (On an optimistic note, nobody in the office seemed to notice today. Then again, they are all  men . They never notice).

      When I was young, I used to play this game: I'd think of a word that I was embarrassed to say, or one that awakened dark memories - and then I'd force myself to say it. Again and again and again and again.  Until the word no longer had any meaning. Until the word's significance, both literal and emotional, was eroded to a mumbled string of sounds with no depth.   If only I could do the same with my memories.

      I woke up early today (well, early for a lazy Sunday morning), and the silent, sunny day outside seemed inviting.  I went downstairs, in my nightgown, and walked over to a quiet corner of my apartment complex.  It's a small patch of grass, with a few trees for shade, and the sweet honey smell of some flower drenched in the air.   I lay in the grass and looked up at the clouds. I haven't done that since I was a little girl.  I just lay there for two hours. I may have looked like a homeless, lonely person to a passerby.  Or perhaps like a girl who had been violated - with barely any clothes on, lying alone on the grass.   But I was happy. And calm.  And I thought of what I've done, and what I will do, and what I should do.  And I forgave.  And then I let my mind go blank.   It's on mornings like this -  The warm sun tickling,  The complete silence surrounding,  The peacefulness... It's on mornings like this that I know - things will be all right.

      Changing clothes in a dressing room today, I saw myself in the mirror and was reminded....(The cellulite, the bit butt....)  It's a lucky thing - being (or feeling) overweight - in a way.  If I weren't, I'd be more tempted, and more tempting.  This way - I wouldn't dare.

       Where am I?   Oh, yeah, I am in Washington D.C. I've been traveling since last week - and I am losing track of where I am, what time zone I'm in, who I am meeting.  I am going crazy.  I was in Boston earlier today. Weather on the East Coast was bad and my flight to Washington was delayed once. Then again, then again.  My colleague (The new SE, we'll call him Leon) and I decided to sit at the bar until our flight leaves. Now let me preface by saying I can't hold my alcohol well, and therefore, I usually avoid drinking in the presence of work colleagues. But I've been on the road for a week now, and was having a rough long day, and he was drinking, so I thought - what could go wrong? I'll have one, too.  Well, Leon ordered me a drink I had never tried, a   urlLink "Long Island Ice Tea"  . That was enough to put me over. I was drunk. And as a result, the conversation got carried away.  Interesting, isn't it, how drunken conversations always turn to sex? It's as if that's the only issue we ever really want to talk about deep in our unconscious selves...  I don't think I can remember everything that was said. I do remember sharing some stories of my promiscuous past (from long before I had settled down with my husband) and listening to some torrid tales on Leon's side. But I do know is this: My head hurts, I am tired, I've landed at the wrong airport, I have to get up too early tomorrow (umm..Actually today) and... Leon is never going to look at me the same way.  Darn, I've crossed a line.  Again .

      As a frequent traveller, I thought I'd seen every security measure taken at airport already (I've been asked to take off my shirt in the early days after 9/11, had several "dangerous" items confiscated, including a PDA, a hairclip, and tweezers, and was even held for questioning when a quickscreen display I was bringing back from a trade show had mistakenly tested positive for explosives).  Today - I encountered another type of security measure - and quite a strange one at that:  As I was walking through the security line, the security-person asked me how my name is pronounced. I answer. Then he asked me how my last name was pronounced. I said it (it's quite a long name since I had, in my stupidity, decided to happened it when I got married). "Can you say that again?" he asked, and leaned in to listen careful to my pronunciation. I did. Then I asked him what he was doing - and he said he needed to see how I was pronouncing my name and what kind of accent I had...   ????  What kind of accent I had? Luckily, I have a near-American accent (or at least one that can pass off as American) so that my pronunciation didn't raise any doubt. But what kind of security measure is this? For starters, I have many American-born friends with foreign accents... Secondly - I thought profiling was illegal in the great US of A. And last but not least - if profiling is finally allowed, then is an  accent  the criteria to profile by?  And on that same note - I never did understand the deal with taking off your shoes. Sure, that terrorist-wannabe had explosives in his soles. But is that truly a reason for everyone to remove their shoes at the security gate? What if a terrorist is found carrying explosives in his/her underpants? Will we be asked to remove those too?  I'm  all for  security, heck, I spend most of my waking time on airplanes and need them to be safe - but there's gotta be some sense to it!

      Traveling on a weekend is like    Having to do your homework on your birthday   Having to go to to a family dinner on the same night you've been asked on a hot date   Having to wear a tight, sexy dress when you're having your period and all you want to wear is sweat pants    Having to be a grown up, when, deep inside - you wish you were still a kid.

      I was settled in my aisle seat on my way to Richmond VA, getting ready for my 4.5 hour flight when something - large, hard, and very heavy - hit my face,  hard .  The impact shocked me for a few seconds while the realization of what happened cristalized: a suitcase had fallen from the overhead compartment - right on my face. I could feel one side of my nose swelling, and a scratch near the corner of my eye burning.   For a few seconds I held my face - almost as if I was afraid to take my hands off. I heard someone mumble "oh..shit"... I waitied a few seconds for my eyes to stop burning, then I took my hands away, mumbling "I'm fine, I'm ok"... I was almost expecting a crowd on people boarding the plane to be looking at me, expecting to see if I was ok (too much to expect?) - I was certainly expecting whoever caused the accident to be around apologizing for what he/she had done and making sure I was fine. Neither was true. (I wonder what stung more - the pain of a 22" carry-on suitcase hitting my face or the fact no one bothered to see what damage was caused and if I was ok).  Aside from the pain, I was also worried about my looks. I know, I am vain. (Well, to my defense, I have meetings lined up all week and I don't want a huge purple mark on my cheek, a swollen nose or a gash near my eye).   I went up to the stewardess and asked for some ice to minimize swelling and told her what happened. And yes, I shed a few tears. What? It hurt! I saw myself in the mirror and shed a few more tears over the bump that was forming on my forehead and on my nose.  It's been a few hours now, the swelling has subsided (although I still have some ugly reddish marks on my face) and my bruised ego is back to normal.  Another stewardess has taken down my details as she needs to file a "security report" for the airline (strange... what for? in case I sue? could I sue?).   I look around the people sitting near me - which one of them was the one? How could someone just drop a suitcase on somebody's face and then just walk away as if nothing had happened? Don't people have a snse of decency anymore? A simple " I'm sorry "...? Feels like freakin; New York.

       Background : I've been working at this company for almost 6 years now. For nearly the entire period, I've been working under my boss - let's call him Joe. Naturally, Joe and I have a boss-employee relationship, with all it's complexities and intricacies. As the years went by, and our positions changed, the company grew, then shrunk. At some point I was promoted and was no longer under him - I was a colleague. Then he was promoted and became my boss again.  Nevertheless, the relationship morphed and in addition the boss-employee tier, another tier had been layered on top. A tier where we are, one could say, friends. Where he shares his opinions and thoughts with me and I with him.Where we can speak freely of the company and what management may be doing wrong, as well as about personal issues, trouble at home, etc.  We're at a point where, despite him being my  boss , I feel (felt?) very comfortable to just be me around him. Quirky, and all.    Scolded! : We're at a meeting table, holding an internal office meeting to review some new presentations and collateral. With us are a couple of other employees, one of them a recent hire. I get a call form one of our customers who is having an urgent difficulty with our software and needs an engineer dispatched onsite ASAP. These are the types of things Joe deals with (approving somebody's trip from Israel, etc). So I tell him the contents of the call, and then I say "It's  your  task now." And point my finger at him.  A few minutes later I leave for another meeting. As I am driving to my meeting, Joe calls my cell phone.  He is angry. And he says I shouldn't have talked to him like that, or pointed at him. And that I need to be "put in my place" and I can't feel so "at ease" and "friendly" with him, especially around new employees. He is, after all, my boss - and I should behave accordingly.   What do I do: I apologize and say it won't happen again.   I've been scolded. Now it's awkward. When the line between boss and friend gets blurred - things get... "mucky".  urlLink Mucky . That's how things are.

      I woke up angry today. Steaming. Trying to figure at what or who I was so mad about, I remembered the last minutes of my dream - I was fighting with some cashier over the price of some product that he was trying to overcharge me for. The fight had escalated to shouting and just as I was about to make my point, to rest my case - I woke up.   I looked over at my alarm clock and realized I must get up  now  if I want to make in time for my 8:30 AM conference call (as always, all the important business calls take place in the morning).  I thought this over for two minutes and and decided that if I just get up and go to work - I will be in a foul mood all day - just because of the silly dream.  So I get up - send an email to my prospect telling them "something unexpected" came up and I will have to postpone our call - maybe we could do it this afternoon.   Then I go back to bed, to sleep, so that I can finish off the argument with the make-believe cashier, give him a piece of my mind, and wake up happy.

      It's been a few days since my last post... that's somewhat unusual for me, Ms. Bloggadict.  It seems that lately my life has been taken over by... well... life.  In the race between work, home, my parents problems and my own health - I always seem to be lagging behind, trying to catch up with one issue or another.  I need a time-out. A rest-stop. A break.   "There's no rest for the wicked"

      In the midst of all the raves on Michael Moore's newest hit "Farenheit 9/11" - I revisited the book " urlLink Stupid White Men ", which I had stopped reading after realizing it's factual legitimacy is highly doubtful. An article in today's Yedioth Ahronot newspaper refers to the book and quotes from it - while reiterating some of the discrepancies I found so unsettling when I was reading the book.   Here's what Mr. Moore had to say (in the book) about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and his proposed solution:   1. Congress should inform Israel that it has thirty days to end the bloodshed in its/our name- or we cut off the entire $3 billion. Individual terrorism is bad enough, but state-sponsored terrorism is truly evil. I understand that the world will always have the occasional lone crazy with grievances he feels compelled to avenge with violence. But for the Israelis, a group otherwise good and intelligent people, to collectively enforce a system of terror against another group simply because of their race or religion is unconscionable. And you and I and millions of other taxpaying Americans put up the money for Israel&rsquo;s unconscionable actions- actions that could not exist if each of us wasn&rsquo;t having 4 cents taken from out paychecks today and every day to buy bullets that go into the Israeli guns that kill the Palestinian children.   2. If it wants to keep receiving our tax dollars, Israel should be given a year to work out a plan with the Palestinians to create a nation called Palestine (formed from the West Bank, Gaza, and some strip of land that connects them). This new nation of Palestine must then present a Constitution that not only prohibits any form of aggression against Israel but also guarantees full democratic rights to every Palestinian man, woman, and child.   3. The United States will then give Palestine DOUBLE what it has given Israel in funding (for a permanent peace, I&rsquo;d gladly give up my portion of this- pennies a week). This is not free cash for corrupt public officials like the ones we have in our country. This is Marshall Plan-style direct aid that builds roads, schools, and industries that provide decent-paying jobs.   In his open letter to Arafat - Mr. Moore reflects on the "fact" that 1 million Jews, representing 1/3 of the Israeli population, had recently participated in rallies for peace and in support of Arafat.  He also refers to the "fact" that if the Palestinians were to go on strike, the Israeli government were to fall on it's knees as it is dependent on Palestinian cheap labor.   Many readers, magazines, and TV anchors have commented on this - and while the opinions are divided amongst those who support these ideas and those who don't - the majority seemed to think some of this was feasible.   Does anybody else care that  the facts  in his book don't make sense? As Yedioth Ahronot correctly pointed out: There was never a rally with 1 million participants in Israel. 1 Million is not one third of the population. When the book was written the number of Palestinians working in Israel was very minimal and close to none - certainly not enough to "bring the government to it's knees".   How am I supposed to watch a so-called documentary, so praised by everybody, when I know this guy makes up whatever facts are convenient for his story to make a point?

      A late night chat with a friend brought up some memories of a traumatic night back in high school...  I was probably around 16 years-old - confident, popular, pretty, at my peak. It was passover night, and we were celebrating the Sedder at our house - as usual. A few minutes before the Sedder began I get a call from Sagi. Sagi was a friend, I guess, with the potential for more.  He was 3 years my senior and (though it seems funny to be writing this 10 years later) he was one of the most "popular" guys in our neighborhood. Extremely good looking, smart, dark broody mood... into art and science. Was in Pilot's Training in the army (very prestigious - for those non-Israeli's reading my blog).  Most of the girls in my grade fantasized of Sagi looking at them. I had the privilege at the time, of being almost a friend.  We would meet every few weeks and talk for hours, about everything and anything. We would flirt. We kissed a couple of times...   So that Passover night, Sagi called and asked if I wanted to come over after dinner (he lived down the street). My parents obviously wouldn't like me to go anywhere on Sedder night, but I said I would.  As soon as dinner was over, I slipped out of the house with some excuse. I was still dressed up in the Sedder clothes, a skirt, a white buttoned down shirt  tied at the bottom that exposed my belly.  I walked over, heart beating fast. (I was a very confident girl back then, nothing shook me, I was in control. But with Sagi - I turned to putty).   When I got to his place we talked for a bit, then moved to his bedroom. I knew something was going to happen tonight. I was expecting it. I was wanting it. He looked like he did to. We started kissing and then Sagi moved away. He looked at me intensely and said, slowly: "Unbutton your shirt". Almost commanding me to do it. In a haze, I did - doing my best to look sexy while doing so.  I slowly untied the tie at the bottom of my shirt. He smiled. I unbuttoned my blouse - starting from the bottom. One button at the time, not taking my eyes off his.  When my shirt was undone, it was still covering me, only showing a thin line exposed down my center. Sagi moved the shirt to one side with his finger, brushing my stomach while he did. Then the other side. My breasts in all their glory were exposed in a brand new lace bra. Nipples showing through. I remember the shivers down my spine in those seconds. His eyes fixated on my body. His mouth slowly turning form a frown to a smile. I remember he licked his lips. I knew what was coming and I wanted it, bad.   Then Sagi said suddenly said "OK. That's enough.  Button up .". And got up from the bed. I sat there, not knowing what to do. I quickly buttoned my shirt, got up, trying to look unfazed. He walked me to the door, gave me a peck on the cheek and sent me home.  I didn't cry that night. I was shocked.   That night changed me. I had forgotten all about it until a friend's story in last night chat reminded me of it, and suddenly it all came back - vividly. Ten years later I can say that night is one of the pillars of my sexual self today. For better and for worse.    (For the curious ones - Sagi and I continued to meet, flirt, and kiss every now and then over the years. We never had sex or made out. I haven't heard from him in about 5 years).

      This blog is becoming more than just a whiteboard for rants and raves. It is slowly becoming a window to my innermost thoughts, emotions, fears.  It is becoming a portrait of who I really am, underneath the tailored business suit and make up and behind the loud outgoing voice.  It represents me more than any resume ever could.   Can you imagine?  A business card with my blog's URL elegantly engraved on it.   Shaking hands. "Nice to meet you". Exhcanging cards (with both hands, and a slight bow of the head).  Then they would sit at their office desk under a flickering fluorescent light and check out my site - expecting the usual captions: Professional Experience, Education, Skills...  and instead finding these... "Semblance of Sanity", "My dark hours" and "Bedroom Invasion".   Would I get a follow-up call the next day?

      The time was 1 AM when I heard them. Her, actually.  Moaning... ryhtmic. Panting. Yelping.  They were making love - our neighbors.  With the weather being as beautiful as it has been for the past few days, the windows are open, and I can hear them clearly.  I feel guilty, knowing I am hearing something I shouldn't be hearing. Invading their privacy. And I feel strangely jealous. They are doing what I  should be wanting to do .   I get in bed and close my eyes and try to ignore the moans.  The water in our shower stops running - my husband has finished his shower and will soon join me in bed.  I pretend to be asleep as he tiptoes into our room quitely and then into our bed. He carefully pulls the cover around himself - careful not to move, not to wake me up.   We lay there - both of us hearing our neighbors. Neither of us moving a muscle.  And I wonder what he is thinking. Is he aroused? Annoyed? Jealous? Is he mad at me for not being the wife I should be - like the wife next door?

       Warning : This entry is of the "Dear Diary" genre...    I've  urlLink mentioned "Ralph"  before. I've wanted to write about him many times since. But every time I start to write of him, of how he is and what he's done to my family, I get so overwhelmed - with anger, sadness, and hate - it becomes too much.  Too much to summarize in a blog. Too much to dive into without pages and pages of years of history.  So here I am again, bursting with anguish for what he's putting my parents through, lacking the strength to put it in writing.   He's my uncle. A blood relative. Someone who, in a normal family (if there even is such a thing) would be a person to trust. And yet, there is no one I trust less.   Have you seen the movie "Catch me if you can"? That story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a successful con artist who managed to pass himself off as several identities...? I was watching that movie and thinking that's him. That's Ralph.  The charisma to convince everybody (including yourself) you are somebody you've never been.  The charm to fool people.  The audacity to lie and to con and to cheat and to steal under the pretense of a lie.  A pathology. A pathological liar.  I am sure these people, Frank Jr. and my uncle - have some mental default.   The funny (or sad) thing is - he calls himself Orthodox. He wears his beard long, wears a "kippa" and a hat, wears the dark suit.  He keeps a kosher kitchen - separating meat utensils from milk utensils.  He goes to the synagogue and spends his days reading the bible.  He's even said he is two months away form becoming a Rabbi.   It's always bothered me - how people that pretend to be G-d fearing and religious are later discovered to be the worst criminals. How someone who says that being religious is the most important thing in his life is, in reality, so far from being what Judaism is all about. Case in point: Ralph has beat up his ex-wife, abandoned his children, cheated (and still cheats) on his new wife/wives, stolen (and still steals) from strangers and from family, lied, disrespected his father...   For some reason we have higher expectations from those who are religious. Believing their religion guides them in a better way. For some reason we are more disappointed when they fail than when secular people fail. They, the religious, should have known better. Could have done better.  Like those priests that molested boys.    Hypocrisy.    For the past year or so, my husband and I have been supporting my parents in their battles with Ralph. Providing a listening ear, paying lawyers, paying courts, paying debts.  My husband has been a saint - taking over the responsibility of looking after my parents, listening to them, providing insight. Agreeing to loan them our money, dozens of thousands of dollars - our future.  He's been my strength when I couldn't take it anymore.   And now things have taken a turn for the worst. Another legal tangle for my parents, another loss of a source of income -and we can both see what's coming. More loans needed.  We want to help.  I  want to help. They are my parents and I owe them my life and everything I have got.  But I see it happening... I see my husband backing away... I see him reconsidering the risks... I see him fearing our future. We don't have much left to give.  And I see it coming. The battle.  Between my rationale and my conscience.  Between my need to lead my own adult life and my need to bail my parents out again.  Between my husband and I. Between us.  I can see it coming and tearing my life apart.  And I am afraid.    Fear.    I live in a beautiful neighborhood in Palo Alto. My apartment complex has 7 pools, a tennis court, gym, exercise classes, a movie theater, pool table, ping pong, and other perks. I have a maid that comes every two weeks to clean up after us.  My husband and I eat out regularly. I shop quite often. We travel.   My father is sleeping on a sofa in the living room of the apartment he is sharing with my uncle in NY. He borrows my money for daily necessities.  My parent's house in Israel used to be beautiful - a well groomed house in a rich neighborhood. If you walk in it today you will see the signs of the hard years on the walls, the furniture, in the air. The only time my parent splure on something like new clothes is when I buy them. They know what it was like to be rich. Now they know what it is like to be poor.   Yet here I am - living lavishly, far away.   How can I  NOT  feel guilty?

      You think you are different.  Sure, people who don't know you may think you are just like them. After all, you have two hands, two feet, two eyes, one nose. You speak their language. You laugh and you cry - just like them. But you know, you are different.  You know you feel things at a different level, can express yourself in a different way.  You know you can do this better, and that better, and this faster, and that clearer.  You think you have done more with less.  You think you could be what they never would be able to.  And you wonder - does everybody else feel the same way about themselves? Or is it really... REALLY... just you.

      When  two or more  different body parts are touching another person's (accidentally or purposely), for a period of time  longer than 10 seconds , and  nobody pulls away , there is undeniable attraction.   Note: There  can  be attraction without these condition being met. However, if all three conditions are met - one can say with certainty there  is  attraction.

      Another tidbit from "Headlines" segment of Jay Leno's Tonight Show on NBC:  This was taken from a newspaper:  The Allegan County Board of Commissioners has a plan. That plan is to develop a plan that will help them plan out their long term strategic planning.

      And  urlLink speaking of bald , ever since my  urlLink Easystraigh fiasco , I've been shedding so much hair, it's not even funny.  I swear, I must have lost at least a fifth of the hair on my head. If this doesn't stop, I will soon be bald, too.  But yes, my hair is straight now... if that's any consolation.  Oh, and I joined a class action suit againts them. Viva america.

      I had a chat session with my friend G, when she had a "Carrie" moment (from sex-in-the-city)   G: i just wonder - are there guys you have fun with and guys you marry? and maybe the two kinds of fun are different?    Food for thought.

      Some days, you wake up and you know,  you just know , you'd be better off if you just curled back up and stayed in bed.  Today was one of such days.  I managed to get my self involved in my own little scandal (which could, potentially, cost me my job).   I am sure my loyal readers are not interested in the gory details of how I managed to screw up (again), and I am not in the mood for a long, whiny post, so here are the highlights of the latest drama in my life: - Every employee at my company is issued a personal calling card to be used for work related calls. It is customary that it be used for "reasonable" amount of personal calls. - I was using a colleague's company calling card instead of my own for a while (mine wasn't working), nothing too serious here.  - I gave my parents the calling card one day, when they had an emergency and no other way to call each other.  - My parents assumed (and I didn't correct them) the calling card was my own - They did not know it was a company card and my company pays for it - As my parents have been living apart for several months now (due to the financial issues I whine about every now and then) they have been using my card (assuming I'd pay for it and add it to their ever-growing debt). They've been using it  a lot . $2000 in the past month (They've had some rough times).  - My company received the bill and started a police investigation for fraud (!!!) - As soon as the story found its way to me I let everyone know I was responsible for this and I'd pay all the expenses immediately.   This could have ended here. It was a mistake. They didn't know. I'll pay it all. End of story.  But no, now it's about trust, and honor and whatnot. My managers, being the Israelis they are - are certain I have been trying to "pull a fast one" and defraud my company by racking up personal calls on their check, and knowing the blame would fall on my colleague (owner of the card). (I'd think, after 5.5 years with them, having gone through so much and proven myself over and over, there'd be a little more trust, but hey - that's me).  Anyways - the powers to be are holding meeting after meeting to see what should be done to the felon (that, my friends, is me).   So there you have it - from the shooting star in the company to a menace to society - all in one day.  Yeah, I'm exaggerating, but hey - I'm a bit emotional here.  I'll just have to hang tight, brace myself, repeat the words "No malicious intent" and "I'm sorry" and many times as humanly possible, and wait for this to blow over.   Now can I curl up and go back to bed?

      In a completely different tone than my previous post of today...   I was reading  urlLink Diva's post  (her  urlLink blog  always has something interesting going on) and decided to take  urlLink the test  myself.  Here's my result. I am:    The Stiletto

      I was almost 18 when "Y" was killed. "Y" and his friends were all one year older than I was. I was training in an army course, and was allowed the day off to attend Y's funeral. It was the first funeral I had attended of a friend, someone around my age (later in life, I would attend a dozen more...). That funeral remained etched in my memory. The soldiers crying, the shock, the parents. The poem Y's sister read when he was buried.  Y was part of a close-knit gang of guys, who did everything together: "Y"," I", "N", and "E". I had dated "N" for almost a year, and had some on/off romance with "I". They were all devastated, but "I" - who was Y's best friend, was shattered. He committed suicide a couple of months later, and that was the second funeral I had attended. That funeral was more difficult, more painful and more terrible. Because it may have been prevented, because I had a crush on him, because we had kissed only a few months earlier.   After that things changed, people drifted apart, some started using drugs. "N" left the army and had a nervous breakdown. I grew up, grew away, grew different.   Years had gone by, and although not forgotten, these memories were pushed back into the dusty - hardly used - drawers of my brain. Hardly ever resurfacing. Until today.  I saw "I'"s face in that of a teenager on the street. The same smile, the same freckles. I stopped in my tracks. That's how "I" looked before he died. (I couldn't age him in my mind).  I tried to look them both up on the internet ("Y" and "I"). Surely they have been commemorated somehow. "I" does not appear anywhere (anywhere that is googable, anyways). "Y" is only briefly mentioned in the caption of a photo included in the article. A photo from that first funeral. "N" is wearing the red beret. I was standing right next to them.  They are not on the Internet. They are gone.    urlLink    An Israeli soldier weeps during the funeral of Sgt. ----- in 1995.

      He used to work here. He has since moved on, and we haven't heard from him in a while. He was a great employee, a respected and polite gentleman. Clean-cut, professional, respectful, handsome and very polite. Married.  Today a letter addressed to him was received at our office. As we have no forwarding address for him, and the envelope looked like it might be a business related letter - our secretary opened it.  In the envelope was a love-filled, lustful short letter in a greeting card. Apparently from an ex-girlfriend or lover. In this card, she expressed her undying love.. how she'd been carrying around his picture for years... how they had a second chance a couldn't "blow it again". She listed dates when she'd be alone (her husband traveling) when they could meet.  It was a very personal letter, which we had desecrated by reading - a sin which I am compounding by writing about it in my blog.  That peek into his secret life, so different from the man we had known - was a rush.  Knowing we weren't supposed to read what we were reading, know what we had learned, guess what we deducted... I couldn't help it.   I, voyeur.     Then I thought, something like that could happen to me. Either before or after I'm gone - someone could write an incriminating letter to me. My colleagues could find it. My husband could read it.  Worse than this blog.  And I recalled a letter I received (when, I can not say - nor from who) - and which could have been found.  I looked it up, re-read it. And remembered. Once upon a time... Here is the letter - devoid of any identifying names or details - but in its entirety.  urlLink

       urlLink Fiat Lux  wrote  urlLink an interesting post  in  urlLink her blog  today, about this site,  urlLink Wordcount .  Those who know me well, will understand why this site has such an appeal for me. My fascination with language, my background, etc... I was instantly captivated.  The more I played around with it, the more interesting items I discovered.   Remember  urlLink my post from a long time ago , where my boss had complained I use the word "very" and "many" too much? Well "very" is ranked at 84 (out of 86800) and "many" is ranked as 108. Both pretty high up - so I guess I am within the normal allowed usage of them both.   Remember  urlLink my post on trying to learn power words ?  urlLink SteveR  had suggested "taxonomy" in his comment. This word is ranked at 25048... Certainly a great word (assuming the less a word is used, the more impressive it can be).   "Love" ranked at 384 while "hate" ranked at 3107 - what a positive reflection on the English language.   "I" is 11 ("you" is 14), "My" is 69 ("your" is 73) - tells us something about priorities.    "Yes"  is 146 but is closely followed by "however" at 147, for safety's sake . And " no " beats them both at 51.

      Like millions of others (men and  urlLink women ), I suffer from back pain. I have a  urlLink degenerated  disc and a  urlLink herniated  disc in my lumbar spine, with  urlLink siatica  (a pinched sciatic nerve) - causing constant pain in both my lower back and legs. I know, I know, I am a bit young to be complaining of such ailments, but such is life. (I've been considering  urlLink discectomy surgery  but am trying other alternatives for now).   Anyways, last night the pain became almost unbearable. Pills, stretching, ice - nothing helped. Then I remembered that my physical therapist had recommended that I exercise whenever the pain is strong. The aerobic exercise would cause the blood flow to the area to increase, thus helping to flush out the inflammation in the area and relieving the pain.  As much as I avoid exercising, I was willing to try anything - so I put on my sports bra and cute exercise outfit and headed to the gym.  The problem with lower back pain is, though, that many things aggravate it. Sitting, Walking or standing all put pressure on the lumbar area - causing the pain to increase. This pretty much rules out any aerobic exercise.  I looked longingly at the stationary bike (you know  urlLink  the type, with a comfortable backrest ?), my favorite machine, but opted instead for the elliptical trainer - where there would be less pressure on my back.  So as I was sweating through a one hour session, I thought of a wonderful exercise machine for people with pain like mine.  A  horizontal stationary bike .  People who suffer from back pain usually feel relief when laying on their backs. Furthermore, many of the exercises recommended for lower back-pain involve one laying on their back and moving their legs in a way that strengthens the lower abdominal and core muscles as well as the thighs. A "bicycling" motion, laying on your back. Simple, ingenious, healthy. Get your aerobic exercise and stay on your back too.  Another invention for my drawer.

      There's and old Israeli song, אנשים טובים באמצע הדרך (Translated to: Good People in the Middle of the Road)...  These kind of people and few and far in between - the kind that will stop to help a stranger out.  My father was lucky enough to have run into someone like that today. He was lost on a NY highway and frazzled, no knowing which direction to go to get back on track.  This guy at a gas station helped him out, and not only let my dad follow him, but also gave him his cell phone - in case he got lost again. Which, he did. This mystery nice guy proceeded to spend a long time on the phone with my dad pointing him in the right direction and making sure he got where he needed to go.    It is comforting to know people like that still exist , even in NY.  I have the guy's first name and cell phone number and wish I could do something to express my appreciation. What is proper protocol? A thank you call? Find out his address and send a card or gift? (Or is that too creepy?).  Well, whatever I end up doing, that guy is certainly going to have good karma.

      Following the recent turmoil in my life (or in my mind) -  he  came up to me at work today and we talked shop for a few minutes.  Then he said "look at me for a minute", I did and he smiled. I asked "What?" and he said "Your eyes". "My eyes, what?" I asked. "Your eyes are the same color as your shirt. Wow".  We smiled and there was a minute of silence, before we continued to discuss my sales funnel.   This can't be all in my mind. Is it?  Am I giving off a scent? Whatever it is, it is dangerous.  But oh, so fun .

      OK - so I read porn every now and then. Not frequently, not obsessively, but every few weeks I troll the web for some spicy reading material.  I know, it is not the most feminine trait in the world, but there you have it.   In one of my recent "porn searches" I found a semi-porn blog. In this blog, a woman writes of her fantasies, posts links to her favorite pornographic stories and material, etc. In her latest post, she had written an eloquent piece about how women occasionally like to be "taken", more forcefully conquered, without necessarily playing the whole sentimental game. I thought it was well put, and quite true, and was careless enough (as usual) to post a comment. My simple comment ("Hear, hear") is not the careless part, it was the fact I signed with my blog address that was careless.   Ever since (It's been a few days) I have been getting hundreds of hits on my blog, from people who clicked on that comment. (Once again, I know this courtesy of  urlLink Blogpatrol ).  Well, my fellow porn lovers, I am sorry to disappoint you, but this  not  a pornographic blog... Despite what my comment may have led you to think. At least it isn't  yet ... ;-)

      I've recently discovered  urlLink blogpatrol  which allows me to see the IP addresses of the people visiting my site, (as well as the referrers they come from, but more on that later). Then I discovered that with the IP address, I can find out the actual location (City, State, Country) of my visitors. (Yes, it is kind of Big-brother-is-watching-scary).  I was pleased (and surprised) to see people from all over the world hitting my blog: Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, south Africa, Canada, Singapore, and obviously USA.  So far, so good.  But a few days ago I noticed someone from Brooklyn has been reading my blog. When I saw this is a returning reader, my heart missed a bit.  I had just finished reading this  urlLink confession of a fellow blogger , in which she tells the world her Mom reads her blog. Notice my comments... (Recap: I would die if my family read my blog).  Well, my father and uncle's family are in Brooklyn. Are they reading it???   Paranoia is taking over me.    So - here is my plea: If you are my Brooklyn reader, and my sanity means anything to you, please post a short comment letting me know you are not my dad, uncle or relative.  Please . You can post anonymously, of course.   And if you, dear Brooklyn reader, are a family member as I fear: then I deeply apologize if my musings offended you in any way, shape or form.  urlLink Who said our family was normal ?

      In reading  urlLink this article,  I didn't know whether to laugh this off as another weird patent, or to be in awe of what could, potentially, be a huge new invention.   In late June, the U.S. Patent Office took the idea seriously enough to award Microsoft patent number 6,754,472&#8212;titled "method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the human body."  Can you imagine?  Transferring files to each other while holding hands... or making out... ?  Electrocuting your baby while she's breast-feeding?   Hmmm....
