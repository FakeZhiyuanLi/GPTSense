      Hey there again well i talked to my lil buddy and he gave me sum ideas and he said i should tell you guys bouts my friends and ppl i kno in general so yeah lets see  Sarah- she is wack but i luv her her nickname (cinnamon toast crunch) Amelia- My big sis she aint really but she has been lyk my older sis so she is and yeah she is just the coolest big sis out there Scarlett- Well i do admit when i first met her i did not lyk her at all but i really got to know her through computer class and now she is a really kew kew person dun know hwt i would do with out her she is the best and her luver is diego lol shhhh dun tell her i told everyone lol Travis- he has been my niggest crush sense lyk 7th grade lol not very long only two years but those where sum fun two years Lindz- even though her and i get into so many fights we still hecka tight luv dat girl she is just out there but out of all my friends there arent many that are normal(shhh dun tell them i said that) umm who else to talk about i can tell you about ALL my ex's Eddie- he was and probably my best boyfriend ever he is a awesome any girl who gets a chance with him is lucky. i could have had a second chance but i think of him more as a bro now than anything else. relationship length- 3 1/2 months Nick- WHAT A JERK!!! I hate him and i think hate is even too nice of a word for him!!! Never date him ever!!! relationship length0 4 days Sergio- He is an awesome boyfriend the only problem he dun know how to pick up the phone and call you nothing he dun really do nothing. relationship length- 3 weeks Steven- Well hmm....... NOt much to say about him he just i dun know he is an ok boyfriend but i wouldnt recomend datin him unless you feel lyk hearin all this crap being talked about him and you bein teased cuz of him. relationship length- 1 week Robert- I luvd this guy he was so GREAT better then eddie probably or maybe a tie he can make you smile when you are feelin the worst and he just is there for you whenever you need him. relationship length-2 1/2 weeks. i thought that one was goin to last but it didnt he said i changed? how i dun know ? but hey wht eva Jaime- My most recent and at this moment we are still together. He is really kewl he is all about me or at least i think he is i aint to sure found a luv letter to another chick he said it is hecka old but y would he still have it? I dun knoe give me sum feed back keep him and give him another chance or dump him and let him go? you pick and let me know. Relationship length- 2 weeks as of tomorrow and hopefully we will go longer but if he cheatin buh byez to him.   Well hmm i dun think i have many other ppl to talk about i have more friends but we aint talkin right now. I have lots of friends and i aint lyin bout that but none of them seem to want to listen to me and wht i have to say so i am kinda givin up on them..... There was a teacher i knew and the other day i ran into her and i told her about my probs with my friends and she told me to let sum ppl go so that is wht i did.....  Well i dun want to bore you anymore so give me sum feed back ight?  wellz buh byez!!!!  crazeegrl
