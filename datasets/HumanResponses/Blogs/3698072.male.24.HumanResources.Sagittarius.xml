         Well, it's been a few days.      Kelly and I actually got out of the apartment a couple of times since I wrote. Thursday night we went to see Dodgeball (unbelievably funny) with Jason and Neil, and then went out to see Laurie compete in the &quot;McHenry Idol&quot; karaoke finals (She didn't win, but what do the judges know?? I don't know who won, but I suspect by McHenry county music tastes, it was probably one of the ladies who laid heavily into the country music... blech).      Friday night, we went downtown to see our friend Paul in a short sketch comedy show at Second City. The improv group that went before his segment was.... interesting. I suppose when I think of improv, I think of improv games (like &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;). But this was like a really bad play that was proud to be bad because it was IMPROVISED. Whoopee. After that, we hoofed it a dozen blocks or so to a club that everyone wanted to go to... that was closed. So, after hoofing it back across the twelve blocks to the car, we just called it a night. Still, we had a good time, and it was worth it to get to see everyone.      Other than that, there's not a lot of excitement in my world today. I'm finally out of training and doing my job again, which is a mixed blessing. No mind-numbing training anymore, but I miss getting to zone out all morning. My brain's definitely going to need a kick-start for the next few days.      I've been thinking about my writing since I last put in an entry here, but haven't actually gotten any work done. &nbsp;Joel, the hero of my &quot;Dreaming&quot; story is still taking form for me. I've been trying to get past the block I've reached on another of my short stories, and I've been somewhat daunted by the sheer amount of work there is to be done on the nontraditional project I've been working on. So... I'd have liked to see myself get some actual work done, but at least the wheels are still spinning.      I don't have that jealous feeling I normally get after I see one of my friends doing something to express him/herself creatively, so apparently in my mind, I *am* still working on all of this, and I'm happy about where it's going.      I need to post pictures when I get home... the dove that laid her eggs in our flowerbox has her &nbsp;babies now, and they're getting old enough to be a little discontent with mom sitting on them all day long. The cats spend hours sitting on our kitchen table and watching them.

      Day seven of nine, and I've officially not learned a thing today.  A few things on my mind this afternoon. For one, season two of  Nip/Tuck  started last night and I'm thrilled. I have a good show to watch again! (I know, there are a lot of great shows out there, but  N/T  is the only one I've followed from the start) I love how one episode of  Nip/Tuck  can be tragic, touching, and devilishly funny without sudden, jarring changes in tone.  Also, I talked to my buddy Jason last night for the first time in a few weeks. He's on the rocks with his girlfriend and it sounds like things may not work out for them. Of course I wish him the best, but if this becomes a permanent parting for them, at least it's happening before she follows him out to LA (he's following his dreams there in a few months).  Talking to him was a good thing, though. I moved closer to my friends a few months ago so we could all see each other more and it just hasn't worked out that way. The daily grind has sort of put some distance between us. But, we always seem to pick right up where we left off and it seems that this weekend I'll have a few chances to pick things up with most of my close group of friends.  All that thinking about relationships made me think of my character Joel. Who are his friends? Does he have any? What do they think of each other? Is Joel single? Dating? Married? Divorced? He isn't quite answering me yet, but I can tell he's lonely. If he has someone in his life, there's a distance there. Maybe physical, maybe they've just grown apart emotionally.  On a geekier note, what do I want to do tonight? I have the new TNT mini-series of Salem's Lot to watch, but I also got my hands on some old PC games that I never got a chance to play ( Freedom Force ,  Fallout , and  Morrowwind ). Or I could actually get some work done around the apartment. Ha-ha.  All kidding aside, though, talk at you later.

      Here I am updating from work again. I'm training up to start work for a new client at my company and I'm stuck sitting through new-hire training for the newbies who are also starting on the same client. Ever sit through training for something that you already know like the back of your hand? For four hours? Thank god for my blog, or I'd be snoring right now.  So, I've been debating if I want to discuss the writing projects that I've been working on in this blog or not. The paranoid part of me says "people will read this and steal your ideas!" But the rational part of me thinks that nobody who doesn't already know me and the things I write will read this anyway. And if they do, who's to say anyone will think my ideas are good enough to steal in the first place? So, rational, self-depreciating me wins. Writing is a personal thing-- if you don't have your own ideas to express, why do you write in the first place? Any writer worth his/her salt has plenty to express without taking them off of my blog.  The project on my mind right now is probably a novel (most of my "traditional" work is short fiction). It started with me wanting to write a fantasy-ish fish-out-of-water story where a "normal" guy learns there's more to his world than he thought (Gaiman's  Neverwhere  or Adams's  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ). My original idea was to throw him into a corporation run by mythic creatures (vampires, dryads, centaurs, etc) displaced out of society because no-one believes in them anymore. But, that seemed to be a sort of dead-end. Where's the conflict? Who is the antagonist?   Reading King's latest installment of his Dark Tower series ( Song of Susannah ) made me think more about alternate dimensions that start being just a little different and become more and more unlike the "key" world as you traverse them. What if dreams are one of these worlds? What if the dream world used to be the key world, but its importance has diminished and it is dying? Could the corporation our hero has just started to work for be run by the denizens of the dreaming world?  That's where I'm at now. Our hero, Joel, is an awkward, unhappy man who has taken what he thinks is simply the latest in a string of unsatisfying temp jobs at another soulless corporation (Working name is SomnoCorp). SomnoCorp is, in fact the home of displaced dream creatures who have been pulled into our reality to avoid and prevent the destruction of their own. SomnoCorp's front is a sleep institute that studies various sleep disorders. Their more important purpose, however, is to relocate dream creatures as their parts of the dreaming world fade away, and to find a way to keep the Dreaming Heart beating. (I really want to call this world the Dreaming, but I think that's what Gaiman calls the  Sandman 's realm)  So where is the conflict? There is another faction in the dreaming world who see this as an opportunity. Nightmare creatures crave power, and they see the doorways that SomnoCorp has opened as a way to invade the waking world and take it for their own. Hell on Earth.  That's all still brewing in the back of my mind while I work on a few pieces of short fiction and another project that isn't as easily defined. But, I've fleshed it out quite a bit just by typing up this synopsis, so I'm optimistic about where it's headed.  Anyone reading this? If so, any thoughts?

      My first post. There's always something cool about the first entry in a blank diary. Not quite the same feeling from an empty blog, but it'll do.  I'll forego the introductions. My profile is up there. If you don't already know me and you're interested, take a peek.  So what is this thing? Well, I'll be using it as a day-to-day blog, a dream journal, and a little bit of a workbook for the fiction I've been writing. Maybe I'll even post my completed work here. Pretty much just a tool to keep myself writing as much as possible.  As I will probably often do, I'm writing this from work. I should probably go and actually do something. I'll write more when I can, but until then... Welcome to my blog.

         urlLink     We took a trip into the city on Sunday and managed to avoid taking any  urlLink shit-splattered boat rides . Also got to check out the new  urlLink Millennium Park . This lady is one half of the new fountain that faces Michigan Avenue. Quite cool really, and the kids absolutely love it.

      Okay, I've found a new obsession.   urlLink Netflix .  Netflix is fantastic. Sure, it's overpriced, and the DVDs don't arrive nearly as often as I'd like them to. But what a concept. I go to get the bills from my mail, and voila, the first quarter of season 2 of  Six Feet Under !  And thank you, thank you, Netflix, for delivering  Six Feet Under  and  The Shield  and  Queer as Folk  and  Alias  and a million other great things that I never got into and was too lazy to go to Blockbuster and rent.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go watch Mackey hunt down some cop killers.

      Yeah, so if you haven't figured it out yet (and, for that matter, if you're even reading this), I'm a major procrastinator. I get really into something for a few days and then I just drop it for weeks on end. Ah well, at least I can recognize that I'm doing it.  So, what's up with me? I'm currently listening to Papa Dove (or is it Mama Dove?) trying to coax Baby Dove to take the leap out of the flowerpot on my deck that they've made their home and learn to fly. This is the second batch of Baby Doves that have been born on my deck. The first time, I admit it, it was cute. Now I can't wait for them to leave. Mama Dove is a whore, though, and with all my luck she'll lay another batch of Baby Doves in a day or two.  Just finished watching  Donnie Darko  last night for the first time. Now, I'm not one of those who sits through a movie bugging the person next to him with "who's that guy?" or "what did he say?" and I like to think I'm fairly intelligent, but I had a hard HARD time following  DD . Maybe it requires further viewings. I did like it though, and I found the rendition of "Mad World" that plays at the end VERY touching.  Also saw  The Village  this weekend and BOY are a whole lot of people who wanted to see a monster movie going to be pissed off. I really liked it, but many MANY will not. I read someone somewhere online call it "The movie that Michael Moore would have made if he had an ouce of subtlety in his body" or some such. That's it, dead on. I won't spoil it for the imaginary people who I like to pretend are reading this, but I'll put a caveat out there.. It isn't a monster movie. It's a social commentary, some would say on post-9/11 America. Be warned.  With that said, I'm going to sign off for now. I'll do my best to-- ah, who am I kidding. I'll write when I write.  Allez ciao for now.
