      That is one awesome song.  Everyone, go buy Vendetta's Reds CD.  Yes, it came out last year.  But its great.  And for once, I'm not pushing something for myself.  I don't get points if you go to their site, or money or a special autograph if you buy their CD.  They are simply a really amazing music group.  This is my last pre-vacation entry, so it better be good, eh?  I don't want you to think of me as a loser for the next month.  First off, it's important to wish everyone a Happy Birthday who I will be missing while gone:  Kryzilla, Sam, Josie, Lexi, Courtney, and everyone else.  I love you, I miss you, and I'll make y'all banners when I get back!  Secondly, I got invited to the beach by a hot guy!  Haha, I was at work, eating a strawberry starburst.  He asked me if I wanted to go to the beach, what time was I getting off work?  Too bad I wasn't getting off until four.  Lame post, but whatever.  I'll see you all when I get back.  Email me, darlings!

      Tangerine is such a funny name for a color.  I understand that the color isn't quite orange, but why call it tangerine?  I mean, its something to think about it.  Did the color orange or the fruit orange come first?  Depending on which one did, does that mean that the tangerine was named for the color?  Or the color was named for the fruit?    Now that I've confused everyone, I'd like to show you a picture of the shoes I'd like:      I saw these shoes at Famous Footwear today, and I need them.  Really. Bad.  But, I didn't have any money, and my mom wasn't going to give me a cash advance.  I never seem to remember whether I paid her or not when she does that, and most of the time, I think I pay her back twice.  Not fun.  But, I'm getting a paycheck two days after I come back from vacation, and I should have around 16 hours on it.  Which is nice.  And then I'll go back and buy them.  Because I seriously doubt they'll be sold out.  I showed them to my grandma, and I could tell she thought I was joking:  "Grandma, look!"  This is Cindie, trying to bond with her Grandma.  Yes, I shouldn't have picked shoes as a topic, but so?  "Oh?"  "Don't you like them?"  "Do you?"  "Um, yeah."  Can you feel the air coming out the bubble that just burst?  "They're...bright."  Yay.

      I can't think of a creative title for this one.  Maybe it will come to me as I write it.  My dad is watching "The Others" right now.  He's had it on every time its been on.  Considering the fact that it's been on TNT about 460286082 times in the past week, it's a pretty safe assumption to say he's seen the whole thing.  Yet, he watches on.  And yes, this  is  coming from the girl that has watched bits and pieces of Miracle for a record eight days straight.  Oops, I'm a hypocrite.  I finally told the last person I wanted to tell that I'm going away on vacation.  I feel incredibly stupid doing so, but there was no way around it.  So I made up some crap story about my aunt staying over my house for the month, so that she doesn't go tell all her friends "Hey, Cindie's house is empty for the month, lets party, crash, and take all her music because we're  evil ".  Fun.  I can see it happening too.  The Mets are on.  They are over .500, and I'm so proud of them.  No, I don't know any of them personally, but I hate seeing them lose.  And I know that when you're a fan, you don't want to see your team lose, that kind of goes hand in hand, but its always heartbreaking and I wish I could do something about it.  So, yeah, its good that they're winning now.  I wish other people would just shut their mouths about them now.  Hmm, I guess I should mention the fact that HPB is down, again.  It'll more than likely be up again in July, but I won't be there, so that kind of annoys me.  I don't want to miss a months worth of things, I don't want to miss any games, I don't want to miss SSW.  But, there isn't a gosh darn thing I can do about it.  I'm just mad I can't get online to switch my signature so people know I'm gone, and that I haven't abandoned the boards.  Hopefully they'll be able to figure that out on their own, though.  We're a pretty smart bunch ;).  While uploading songs onto my iPod, I've discovered a whole bunch of music that I don't listen to anymore.  Take Rubyhorse, for example.  I can't remember the last time I listened to that CD.  I don't think I've ever listened to the entire thing.  But I'm now addicted to it.  And "Dream On", haha.

      Important Note:  I wrote this yesterday night upstairs, so yeah, its all past tense.  I'm not crazy.  My dad got his GPS system today, and so begins the love affair that tears my family apart.  For example, he is now, downstairs, on our family computer, downloading maps and spazzing out on a message board about it.  Cough, no, I don't  spaz  on message boards.  But then again, I don't go on fun ones that deal with global positioning devices.  Did I mention he's waited two weeks for this thing?  And that he was so obsessed over getting it, he went after the FedEx truck that turned down the other street to get it?  It turned out it wasn't in that truck anyway.  So, he called and complained, and said "UPS always gets me my packages fast."  Ouch.  He had to drive me to work today, and he's only gotten it an hour or so before.  They sent it out on another truck.  Thank goodness, because I think if we had to wait one more day, he would have exploded.  The whole thing would have been very Harry Potter of him.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, and it does happen, a funky Knight Bus will come and rescue me from the insanity that is my family, and Commack in general.  He decided this fun, new, GPS system was much more important than his worn out, tired daughter, who needed to get to work in one piece, if possible.  He brought it in the car, because he doesn't drive me to Michael's  every other day , so he couldn't possibly locate it.  He kept staring at it, and finally I took it, hid it on the other side of me, and he couldn't look at it.  Forgive me for wanting to remain alive in the ten minute car ride.  Apparently that is too much to ask.  When he picked me up from work, I was less than happy to see it sitting there, staring at me.  Yes, it won, we know, enough.  And so, its all "I got it to work!", and I'm kind of exhausted from standing around doing nothing for half an hour because CJ won't let us leave.  Standing still is more tiring than walking, it's been scientifically proven.  But I have to sit there with this ugly piece of black machinery (with color LCD display!), and follow us home on it.  Joy.  One good thing did come of it, however.  On the way home, we discovered the name of the street that has no name.  Yup, its all out of that U2 song, or whoever ripped off Bono's voice.  Not sure if it is actually U2.  This street has one house, really deep in the trees, and no one ever goes near it.  For all we know, no one lives there.  But, apparently, it has a name.  And this name is so important to me that I forgot it already.  Something with an M.  Righty-o.  I also came up with a stupid idea in which I'm going to use on this new, fun, funky, uberly awesome blog:  a weekly column highlighting the randomness of me.  It'll be called "The Row", because that is a fun name for a column, and yeah, it'll be fun!  Watch for it on Friday.  It might involve cars, it might not.  It will involve scrapbooking wizards, which is always fun.  And, more than likely, there will be the mention of hockey.  Brace yourselves.  Who cares if the season is over?

      Yes, thats right, I do consider myself a fangirl.  Not in all respects.  I know I went to the world premiere of PoA, but I wouldn't have gone had it not been for the fact that I also wanted to meet up with people.  I am, however, incredibly and publicly obsessed with Michael Mantenuto.       Yes, I'm cool like that.    Anyways, to get on with my story, I decided to watch the commentary on Miracle.  Its between Gavin O'Connor (the director) and two other people who aren't important enough to remember.  So, they're talking, and we get to the scene where its Jack O'Callahan (aka Michael Mantenuto, der) and Herb Brooks on the big Olympic ice rink.  And they're talking, and he flashes the smile that makes me die, and the commentary is as follows:  Yeah, Kurt was trying to make him give off that sort of ecstatic response, so when he started talking about Michael's daughter, and his face just lit up, we knew we had hit it.   WTF?  A daughter?   So, my excellent detective skills led me to IMDB, where I never really looked at his page because it didn't have any pictures.  And I looked through all the trivia, and found out some pretty interesting information.  His nickname is "Manto", which is the cutest thing.   Ever .  And yeah, I scroll down farther, and whoa, they have their cute little "IMDB message board".  Wow.  It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  I thought I was pretty bad, but these girls are incredibly stupid, and I can picture them sitting there typing madly, crying that he has a daughter and that they'll never ever ever get to sleep with him.  ::tear::    But apparently he's engaged.  Whether that's to the mother of his child or not, I'm not sure, and quite frankly, it really doesn't matter all that much.  But gah, talk about pathetic.  They're all like "Well, as long as he's happy", yada yada yada, but you could tell right behind their sugar-coated replies they're like "DIE DIE DIE" to the future Mrs. Michael Mantenuto.  Not that I can blame them, but it was quite ridiculous.  However, the IMDB message boards did point me to a nice little Yahoo Group about Miracle, which I shalt be looking into once I click "publish this post".

      Yes, it is I, Cindie, back in familiar territory.  My own personal blog includes "blogspot.com" once again, and until you look around a bit, it looks like sophomore year all over again.  The important question:  Why am I here?  It's a question that I asked myself last night, and I think I can finally answer it.  Warning:  Slightly long-winded explanation ahead.  First off, I guess its important to point out my history with blogspot, and with online journals in general.  I started my old blog (link will intentionally not be provided) in May of 2001.  I was a freshman, and I didn't feel well, so I came home from school early.  What scary things a mind can think up when sick and idle for a few hours.  Long before anyone was posting on all of those other sites (or so I think, otherwise that comment is very conceited of me), I was happy with my little home on the web.  Eventually, I learned how to customize it, and I had music, marquis lyrics, and an NHL sportsticker.  Wow, I was the cat's meow. Rawr.  After a year of this, however, the world caught up to me, and everyone (and I mean  everyone ) had a Xanga.  I jumped on the bandwagon.  It lasted all of one month.  Not that that month wasn't eventful, however.  My Xanga outlasted the entire Dave saga.  Dave?  Eh?  If you don't know, don't ask, it's not pretty.  In fact, its partially the reason why I left, and entirely the reason why I deleted every entry I had on there.  Boy am I fun!  So, back to my trusty blogger!  But I was soon dissatisfied with its lack of fun features.  The 10 layouts I had to pick from just weren't enough.  And so, when Liz introduced me to Diaryland, and Beautify, with all of its gorgeous templates, it was a match made in heaven.  I quickly packed up and moved.  But it was Summer 2003, and I had already been given a taste of Livejournal, thanks to dear darling HPB.  LJ icons?  Moods?  A comment system?  It was everything I could possibly want, and more.  IocaineSparrow was born.  However, it was inevitable for Blogger to receive a revamp, and that it did.  When Lauren talked about one of my old, dead blogs last night, I checked out Blogger again, and wow has it changed!  I can have comments, and all that other fun stuff.  All of a sudden, its much better than it used to be.  And, well, here I am!  But, but, didn't you want a paid LJ?  Yeah, I did.  But, when it came down to it, I realized I didn't need it, nor did I have much use for it.  I like making icons, but I'm pretty much content with the three I have.  I don't use the mood function, so I have no need for mood themes, and as far as adding things to the layout, well, I just did that here.    And what about the Friends Only thing?  Yeah, well, I'll have to give it up.  I kind of want my Commack friends to be able to read it.  And, if certain skeeves who shalt not be named (although its pretty obvious of whom I speak about) happen to stumble across this, well, then its back to the old LJ, no harm done.  I'll have to keep my old LJ, of course, so don't remove me from your lists!  I love reading everyone elses, and it makes me feel special to see the ones with the lock on them, muahahaha.  And yeah, there will be occasions when there are things I don't need the whole goddamn world to see, so I'll use it then.  Kudos to y'all who actually read this entire thing.  I'm hoping to stick to this one like I did the other.  So, excuse me while I go change my profile on the 4860369830863 sites I belong to.  molto amore > Cinds  P.S.  My icon journal,  urlLink Color/Blind Icons  will still be open and fully operational.  /shameless pluggage P.P.S.  To those of you who frequented my old Blog, maybe,  just maybe , the movie scripts will return.  We'll see what summer and senior year bring, eh?

      I guess its about time to update this again. I've been home for the week, but I haven't bothered writing in here.  The trip was fantastic! I really had such a great time. It all went by as a blur, and I'm really not sure that its August. It feels like July never happened, and I still have two months of summer ahead of me. Yeah, right. I wish!  I started reading  Dark Debts  again last night. I'm not one to read books more than once, even though I insist on buying them, but I make an exception for some. I'm in love. I don't quite remember what happens, all I remember is a fire and an exorcism, but wow, its such an amazing book. Go, read it.  Righty-o, well, the only reason I even went on here is to add my wonderful new affiliate,  urlLink Mo ! So go check her out :).
