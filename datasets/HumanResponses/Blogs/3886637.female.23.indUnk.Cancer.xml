      My husband is in the military and he is now overseas.&nbsp; He has been gone for a little over two weeks.&nbsp; I never realized how much I actually depended on him until he left and I am here by myself with our infant daughter.&nbsp; I am capable of doing everything it is just more time consuming and I feel drained.&nbsp; I live in a neighborhood that is self-absorbed and no one talks to anyone.&nbsp; It is a very unpleasant experience.&nbsp; The only person who has been half-way decent to my family moved clear to the other side of town and is very hard to reach now since she changed jobs.&nbsp; My mother was actually down here for a little while and that was nice.&nbsp; She just went home yesterday.&nbsp; My mom was here to sightsee and make sure I was alright.&nbsp; We went quite a few places and it was nice.&nbsp; I went places with my mom that I haven't been to before and I have lived down here about 18 months.&nbsp; This state is so full of stuff it is hard to see everything.&nbsp; She didn't get to see everything while she was down here so she plans on coming back.&nbsp; That would be really nice.&nbsp; At night is the loneliest time around here.&nbsp; My house is big enough that at night when my daughter is sleeping that you can feel the emptiness and I get kind of sad.&nbsp; I am just used to my husband getting home at midnight from his shift then watching T.V. and then coming into the room and falling asleep.&nbsp; After 3 years of being together you grow quite accustomed to these things.&nbsp; It has made it hard to sleep and I feel like crap all of the time because of not being able to sleep.&nbsp; I still have around 3 more months of this so hopefully I get adjusted to it.&nbsp; Well that is all for now.

      Most people that have known me for a long time told me when I was about 12 that I have changed quite a bit.  That I seemed careless and self-destructive but that has all changed about me.  It all changed when I became a mother.  When I looked into my oldest daughter's eyes I felt my heart melt.  I am a good mother too.  My children mean the world to me and it hurts that because I had moved on in my life and was getting married that my oldest daughter's father decided to hurt me in the worst way possible.  He has made sure that I don't see my daughter and turns around and blames it on his mother.  It's also my fault that it happened too.  It's my fault for having a horrible lawyer who knew where I was (in another state) and failed to contact me in time for the custody hearing.  And now my daughter calls me by my first name because her father and his family have decided to teach her that his new woman is her mommy.  That hurts worse than anything in the world.  He may think that I am this horrible person but I have grown even more since leaving him.  I don't regret leaving him, I just regret some of my choices after leaving him.  Ever since I have been with my husband though I have found that missing piece in my life.  I have grown even more and have really changed my life for the better.  I am more healthy physically and spiritually.  I smile more and am just all around happy with life.  I owe my new life to my children, my husband and God.  Without all of that I wouldn't be the woman I am today.

      I never thought that true love would find me but it did almost 3 years ago.  I never was really happy with relationships I had and I got out of a really hard one and there he was.  You know right when you don't want a relationship or you aren't looking for one that always seems to happen in the movies so I never expected it to happen to me.  But there he was.  You know that saying true love conquers all and when you hear it you bitterly laugh, it's true.  I never thought this was possible but he changed it all and we have been married over 2 years.  I knew he was the one for me one night when we went on a walk and we just clicked and I knew it even more when he kissed me.  But with this relationship came a loss of a friend.  I never meant to hurt this friend and I think of her often.  Things got so messed up that summer that I still haven't sorted them all out.  I know that I am blamed for everything and that she hopes that I rot, but she should know me better than that.  I never ratted her out like she thinks I did.  I wouldn't have done that because I had given her my word.  I know who told on her, but she wouldn't listen to me.  I have no clue what is happening with her but I hope she is doing well and I pray for her.  I know I just went totally off of my love relationship but I just needed to get this off of my chest.  I am extremely happy now except that my oldest daughter doesn't live with me and I hope that her dad is happy and that my old friend is doing well.  Well that is about all on this subject.
