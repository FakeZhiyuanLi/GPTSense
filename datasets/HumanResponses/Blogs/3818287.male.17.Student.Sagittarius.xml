      AAARRRGGG! You know what word I would like to see banned from use? Hesistation. Yeah, because I'm a wuss. Plain and simple wuss. My lady friend came over tonite along with another couple, Brad and Stef. I started the night thinking "I am going to kiss her." Haha, boy, was I wrong! We cuddled and all that but I just couldn't make the tranistion from hug to kiss. Is there some kind of treatment for Wuss-itis? I don't know why I couldn't do it. I mean, I've kissed girls before, but I can honestly say I didn't like any of them near as much as I like Kadey. Could it be because I like her too much and I don't want to rush into things? That's what I'd put my money on. Lord, why must you tease me so? Such a fickle game, this love thing is. So readers, here's the plan: My goal is to (finally) kiss her tomorrow. That would be Monday. And if I don't I give you all permission to kick me in my land down under. Deal? Sweet. Here goes nothing....  Chris  P.S. If you have anything to say to me, i.e. call me names, feel free to write them in the comments.

      Aloha peoples! What's going on? I just got back from a mission farewell. It's weird to be growing and seeing your friends leaving on missions, getting married, or heading off to college. Makes you think twice about things and really wonder "What am I going to do with myself after high school?" Growing up is a bummer if you're not having fun. So that's what I'm doing. Playing the cards I've been handed. And lately, I'm not doing too bad. Now, I don't want to bore all of you with stories of my love life (or lack thereof), but this is my blog so you have no choice. Well my lady friend came over last nite. She was supposed to work till 9 but got off early so I bought a pizza, picked her up (two hot things in my car at once!), and we came back to my hizzle. After chowing down a couple peices of pizza and watching an episode of Simpsons, we popped in a movie. I'm no dummy so of course I chose a scary one, 28 Days Later. Weird movie. Good, but weird. And then when the movie was over, we went outside and laid in my hammock. It was so romantical, my neighbor's dog barking kind of took away from the mood. And I know I'm going to catch a lot of crap for this but I didn't kiss her. I know I could've, maybe even should've, but it was so nice just cuddling. She's very comfortable :) I guess I'm just a wuss or something, but I want to make this last. I don't want to rush into anything and end up ruining it, because with my luck, that's almost guaranteed. I don't know, I've only been had one "girlfriend" before and she couldn't even compare to Kadey. How I managed to get her to like me is beyond me, but I won't complain. It just so confusing but wonderful to be in love. The feeling can't be described. I guess it's as simple as saying I'm in love. I really think I am. I just hope she likes me half as much as I like her. Well, all of you out in TV-Land, wish me luck!  Chris

      "You know it's love when you want to keep holding hands even after you're sweaty" - Anonymous Well it happened to me. Who would have guessed? Hormones seem to be flying every which way lately, and you know what, I couldn't be happier! I guess I should tell the story you're dying to hear. I mean, I wouldn't want the National Enquirer beating me to the punch! It happened like this: I've been hanging out some friends of friends. They go to a different school and such so this summer is really the first time I've been around them. But we've just hung out, watched movies, stayed up late, all that bored teenager stuff. Well, I am a guy so I do notice a beautiful girl when I see one, and believe it or not, I started to fall (big time) for this girl Kadey. She's cute, funny, and just an all around great person to be around. I started to really dig her but being the all-time biggest wuss in the world, I didn't say anything. I started giving hints like asking her if she was in "like" with anyone and I made sure I sat by her during movies. I know it's cheesy but I guess I'm not a ladies man. Bummer! Anywho, well, one night we were talking on MSN and she asked me "Do you have some special girl in your life at the moment"? That was it, I had to tell her, I couldn't hide it anymore. "Well, I guess to be honest, I kinda sorta may possibly have a crush on you". It was out, my cover was blown, and now I was up to the mercy of that little beeyatch Cupid. The first thing she said after that was "Wow". Wow. Wow! What could Wow mean!? It could be "Wow, I'm sorry but I just like you as a friend". Or my luck could give me a 360 and it would be "Wow, I like you too". Believe it or not my luck wasn't it's usual crappy self and she said that she was kind of digging me too! WOOHOO! I felt like a kid in a candy store! We ended up walking about it for over an hour and we both had smiles on our faces the whole time. It was so romantical. But now we're starting to act more like a couple. We're holding hands and sitting really close to each other. I even managed to watch A Walk To Remember, because I didn't care what was going on as long as I was next to her. It's been so long since I have felt this way, and I didn't realize how much I liked it. Everyone should have somebody to love. It puts a permanent smile on your face. I'll keep you posted, hopefully only with good news!  Chris

      With all the fuss from the punk rockers to vote Non-Bush, it seems that bands are using their influence on the voting age crowd by using album titles for political slander/endorsement. Here are just a few of the many, many punk-rock (even though just albums with a political minded title:  V/A - Rock Against Bush Vol. I & II Anti-Flag - The Terror State Bad Religion - The Empire Strikes First Green Day - American Idiot  And whether this has any influence at all in the way you will vote remains to be seen, but it's nice to see people, especially musicians, urging kids to not just vote for Bush, Kerry, or Nader, but to vote in general. MTV is playing ads supporting voting. Not voting for anyone in particular, just get out and vote. And I'm urging all my friends to vote. I'm going to miss being able to vote by 3 weeks, but that won't stop me from getting political come election time. Don't hate me becuase I got political....

      Here's another sign of just how much people care about writing. I saw a sign for a yard sale posted the other day. The sign read like this:     Yard Sale 318 East 1655 North Log Furniture,  Baby , Clothes  Let's see, I already have plenty of log furniture, I have clothes, but I could use a baby. Honestly, how could you not have picked that mistake up when you were writing it? Or double checking it? Or hanging it up? People are morons. That's all I have to say for today. Thanks for your time, I'll be here all week. Try the veal...

      Just got back from seeing Farenheit 9/11. Wow. Wow wow wow. That's about all you can say when you see a movie this powerful and thought provoking. Although some of you may not agree with the things Michael Moore says, you can't help but realize the strange coincidences. Flying the Bin Laden family out of the country? The major role Halliburton played? The "censored" version of George W's military records? Very fishy... But no matter what political party you affiliate yourself with, I highly recommend seeing this movie. It will blow you away!  Chris

      As I brought up earlier, Utah celebrated the Fourth of July holiday on the third of July. And I'm not going to lie to you, it was quite possibly the worst firework "show" I have ever seen! I don't mean to sound like that British tart Simon Cowell, but it was boring! And then trying to get home was a nightmare. Me and my pal Justin almost got lost in Provo because Utah has the satisfaction of having the WORST drivers in the country, probably even the world. No one stopped for stop signs, red lights, or da police. I think the fact that we were listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival saved about 14 people I wanted to shoot. But that's life, so live with it. Well, my ranting must come to close now. I'm off to see Farenheit 9/11. Will the movie live up to the hype? I'll let you know! Peace out,  Chris

       urlLink CNN.com - Facing sour judgment, Scouts offer $250 lemonade - Jul 3, 2004   AAAAHHHH! What has Utah come to!? If the BSA lose this lawsuit, I say it serves them right. Leaving kids overnight unsupervised was the biggest "faux pas" I have ever heard of. And sure, it's a cute story of a bunch of little kids trying to raise money by selling a $250 drink of lemonade but if you're still denying any responsibility for the fire, then why not wait until after the verdict to raise money? I think that this is the big man upstairs saying "Serves you right for not letting gays into the scouting organization". Karma at its finest.

      Well it's the Fourth of July. Not really, but since Utah is lame like that, we decide to just pretend Sundays don't exist. Strange, eh? But I've lived with it for 17 years, I'm sure I can last one more. Not much going on here, last night me and bunch of my homies/posse/crew watched Oceans 11 (the new one). It's a really good movie, very well done. Umm, I've done a lot of fireworks lately. Not the crappy sparkler type stuff. Oh no, we're finishing off the leftovers from last summers trip to Wyoming. Lots of good concerts coming up soon. Let's see, some on my list include Warped Tour, Reel Big Fish, The Hives, Fall Out Boy, Finch, and last but not least Less Than Jake. Of course I'm going to need to take out a second mortgage but I think it's worth it. Umm, not much else to say. My family is going out of town on Wednesday for a week, so you what that means: Party, my house, be there! Go check out www.AcclaimedPunk.com, losta news being added by yours truly. I'm bummed because I have to work today, but it's only for a couple hours. How I hate that job, let me count the ways (this could take a while)....  Ta-ta for now,  Chris  P.S. Almost forgot my Word of Wisdom for today! "Nothing is illegal as long as you don't get caught"
