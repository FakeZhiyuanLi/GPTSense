      Ha, we're doing that as our school musical. Apparently, we are the first school EVER to do a production of Les Mis√©rables on such a scale. Don't know how true this is... I had rehearsals last night. And I am  crap at singing . Also, I always cough when I've been singing, which is stupid. My voice is the poopsmith. I'm in the chorus because I was too scared to audition, for aforementioned reasons, but I don't mind...  My brother has just finished Uni and got his results back yesterday. He got a first!!! He did Computer Science and he is very clever and good at that sort of stuff, so I feel there is warrant for some more exclamation marks. !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! I'm proud of him :) Also, it must be a damn good birthday present (he's twenty-two tomorrow).  Nothing really happened today that I can remember, except my friend being very confused and frightened by herself. She really fancies this guy who she also kinda doesn't like, so you can imagine her problem... anyway...   Random Crap For The Day:  If you don't already know about these sites, you should do.  urlLink Weebl and Bob  Most people have seen at least one animation from this site, but I was watching them  years  ago before they got popular. Seriously. When I first went on there, they only had 10 episodes.  urlLink Homestar Runner  heh.  urlLink Hackles  Don't worry if you don't understand this... Can't think of any more right now.

      Here's my lovely ear... The majority see it and say, "Ewwww, how the hell did you get that in there?"     Nice, huh? If you're wondering, the actual earring is one of those little tubes that hold glow sticks in a loop so you can wear them round your neck or whatever. I can't afford real plugs :(   Random Crap For The Day:  Swaying to the rhythm of the New World Order and Counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums  Keep your head down  Go to sleep   To the rhythm of the war drums  More lyrics. I  am  boring.

      Dunno why I'm making this really, I'll most likely be crap at it. Oh well. Hmmmm, what to say... Well, I had a filling today because my dentist kinda fucked up my tooth before, so it took it upon itself to die. Good, because I missed two lessons; bad becuase now that the feeling's come back, it hurts. Ah well. At least now I'm completely mobile for the first time since the gig I went to on Thursday. Lots of moshing... Also, I've just gone up a gauge. Yays. That means my right ear is 2g now. (Confused?  urlLink Here you go.  That should explain).  Well, nothing else happened to me that I can think of, so I suppose I'll just have to have a Random Crap For The Day section.   Random Crap For The Day:  What if I could go to sleep for days?  Would you count the hours? Or would your restlessness cosume Fading memories of me?  Lyrics, but I think I'll leave it to you to find out who they're by.
