      Lastnight I attended the Prince concert and all I can say is..I wanna go to the last show here!!! Another was just scheduled and I cant get it out of my mind. Oh let me Tell You..He was just great. He sang all his well known hits except "1999" :( sad but expectable. At one point Prince just sat down with his guitar and a stool and the spotlight and sang acoustic versions of "Cream, Little Red Corvette and Rasberry beret" BRILLIANT!!!!  He also did a copy of Led Zepplins "Whole lotta' love" that in itself was awesome. Last song he opened up his shirt and revealed a Pistons jersey and the crowd went nuts! Concert supposivly ended and the lights went out and the crowd roared and lighters flared and 5 mins later you see a purple rain looking curtain appear and you look to your friends and say.."Now would he REALLY do a concert and NOT sing "purple rain"!!!????? OF COURSE NOT!!!!!!! That song is so beautiful and I'm so thankful I got to hear it done live and by the master himself. Oh my god it was just breathtaking..At the end where its just the guitar and "oooooooooooohhhooooohhohhhh!!.." The whole entire audience had control over that one!! The concert was an almost entire 3 hours which I hear is longer than the previous Michigan concerts done this summer. Halfway through the concert I'm already begging my husband, "can we please come back for the 31st show???!!!!"  Ha most likely in my dreams but hey, Prince is worth seeing 1,000 times over again. I was lucky and got 2 shirts, one which I am so proudly wearing today. Now I have concert-idas..stems from going to a kick ass concert and not getting quite enough!! God Bless Prince:)
I wanna go back!! 
By the way....I miss somebody-------where the heck are they:P??

      Blah is what I feel today..I'm not even gonna spell check nor am I caring as I type. I'm completely bored and nothing new is happening at this moment..Same old me..Same worries..Those haven't change although I am enjoying tonight. My birthday is approaching yet I'm not really into it..I'm an adult now so whoopee yah' know. Meanwhile my husband insists on having a simple party with the family but STILL C'mon! My age isn't worth hiding or moving back a year but huh..That makes me think of this face cream I want so bad because even at my young age..Probably from smoking and what not..My face(to me) seems aged..And this Stupid cream that's like the only thing on the market that really works is 60$!! For like a 8 ounce jar..How can retail get away with that crap..Its pitiful I think.If I had 60$ I'd run out and get the simple everyday household needs or clothes for my kid..Yet Target and other stores think I have enough cash for a dinky jar in a dinky box...God that steams me:P My husband is facing some days off here soon and I'm non too thrilled at all..But, what can yah' do:P

Oh and one more thing.
Whats up with neighbors who aren't so neighborly?
Seriously..This really upsets me..Especially when perhaps I act very nice and polite and all I get back is attitude and no words that you really know mean harsh as ever words!! There's no need for it people OK??? Be polite or be polite back..There's no need for "highschool bs ooh Im gonna make you feel like crap" kind of games. I at least know when I myself get a house and become a REAL neighbor I am gonna be so friendly (not up your butt kinda friendly) but you know..Nice and respectful..That's what it boils down to ..  Goodnight all!

      Up and down that's what I feel all the time lately when we talk. When I'm feeling up and take that chance I get the sense that I made a mistake and was too forward again. Its like you are making me take 10 steps backwards and I cant budge forward. Things I want to say, I feel if I do its like..Ok whatever..Heard this 1,000 times before. When you say you love me I melt yet shortly after I'm back in that mental slump again. If you are reading this..My tiredness you sense is not me being tired..Its that frustration that keeps me silent..That aching in my heart that says "what's changed with us?" I love you beyond anything explainable and it kills me when I feel these feelings. Because we have shared things beyond imaginable levels and I feel now as if we've taken so many steps back and are at the point where we are almost meeting again and yet you are someone different :(  I feel like you do not want my love expressed to you anymore..Like its nothing new. I find myself biting my tongue to tell you " I love you"  so I wait and wait and wait till it is said to me..And then I no longer hear it the way I used to.  The whisper in your tone would give me chills..Make me smile and I could feel the intensity of those simple yet big words. Please don't push away the intensity of our love..I know your life right now might not be where you want it to be..And things seem unknowing of where they will go..But I am here and I've gone nowhere, I am on your side and I wanna hear anything you say to me..
one thing that hurts me is when I express how I want to see you I get the impression that you wish I wasn't even speaking..Yes these feelings are indeed bad..I just wanna truly know everythings ok and that our love is intact and that we are to stay strong in what we have to face as a couple  and most of all that I am loved and wanted.. Why don't I feel so anymore?....

      Sigh..I hope things are ok w/ my favorite person...Impatient yes but I hate waiting. 

The Pistons smeared The Lakers tonight..Pretty cool for Detroit!
Today was such a beautiful day..And the night was even better. Beautiful sunset and cool summer breeze..Perfect! 
My stomach is in pain yet again though..I'm so sick of this..I've stopped drinking pop too but haven't seen much relief in that aspect. I don't know..I plan on switching insurance because my doctor isn't caring much..I went to her in December for help and here I am in June wondering what the hell is wrong with me still. I'm way too young to be going through anything that I am right now..Its kinda pathetic in ways. 

I'm really missing my favorite person right now. I wish I could be with him so badly. Just to hold him and talk and laugh with him would be a dream come true..haha even to argue in person  whatever! I just wanna be around him more than anything. I hope he feels the same way..I know of his feelings and I should be happy yet lately I've been feeling as If in ways he's "over me"  like the thrill is gone..yippee its her again kinda deal. I can remember a day where "I love you " just couldn't wait to come out of his mouth ..He couldn't wait to see me or a pic of me..Id write him beautiful heart spilling poetry, he says he loves It but now I feel as If I'm just wasting his time and computer space:P I HATE what I'm feeling so much..Its like I'm doubting what I know is so real. Do I have a problem with comfort or something? Do I honestly expect that "the beautiful beginning" shall always last? I don't know what yet exacly but I do hate it..I feel good and ok and confident of our love and then the simplest thing makes me think Oh Funny Ang..Wrong again:( I love talking with this person and I wish he was still as excited about me as I was him. He has some issues going on in his life and I just wish so badly that I was with him at least to hug him and say "I'm here baby..." I need him to know that I am on his side no matter what..That I will stick by him throughout anything ..And ..I don't know.. I don't know what he wants really. I wish he wanted me like he did before..Now these days I'm under the impression that when I sign on to talk with him, that he makes me wait endless..Maybe fear of talking to someone he wishes not to?:( I wish I really knew. I feel I have to muddle through the basic conversation to get to anything meaningful..We don't talk like we used to..This makes me so sad...:(   Insecure Ang..What the hell is your problem girl?

      First off let me say Coldplay "Clocks" is like one of those songs that you just never get sick of! Aside from music life here is at this moment in time ..good. My kids b day party is approaching and It should be fun The theme is Barbie! hey! shes a toddler! The day after Fathers Day I am attending a Prince concert:) I cant wait. Ive been to one concert at age 12 and one at age 16 but this..this is different. I have been a fan of Prince since I can remember. Back when I was little around 7 or 8 my aunt and mother listened to him. I was hooked along with all the funk and cool music they listened to...."no parkin' baby..no parkin' on the dance floor:P" Anyhow..I should have a BLAST that night!! I think after that my summer will be pretty dull. My b day is soon but who cares about that.

      I'm crazy ...Did I mention that? Crazy in love people. Like beyond love..I'm addicted. Addicted to pleasing, sharing and letting him into my life as much as I can. He's in my head 24/7 literally. I wish I could climb up ontop a building on a busy street and scream like a corny idiot "I love..So and so:P" Names need not be mentioned of course. I want to marry this guy and love him for the rest of my life. He makes me feel so beautiful..Not just on the outside but on the inside. He makes me feel as if what I feel and what I think truly matter. He helped me find my voice! God I love you!
If I could stare into his eyes right now Id whisper I cherish you! Id hug him till he could not breath! He'd have to pound me on the shoulders as if to say I Cant F*****ing Breathe!!!! Our relationship thus far is only described in one word...Magnificent! We clicked so quick on all the right levels..Its always been so exciting and wonderful. I love the sound of his voice..OMG its the sexiest most mature beautifully toned sweetness of any man I've ever met..His thoughts and simple phrases ring and echo all day and night. I think he is gorgeous..Funny thing is we share features..But to me that's like finding a diamond in the rough..A soulmate for life. We are too good to pass up..If I had to Id track him down 30 yrs from now just to  say I never stopped loving you..I would! I just love this man so much. I had to come in here and vent it out! God I love him!

      My apologies to the world and any one else hurt..I'm an idiot..My mind runneth over..I do it to myself. After a long nights sleep I wake up to realize I'm a whack job of the purest kind. Its not insecurities ..I think its more like reading people wrong. Its a shame when at age 24 you think in life you are ok..Grown up and can handle things..And then you realize you just aren't. I'm such a kid in so many ways. I fought so hard to become older as I grew, now that I'm an adult..My minds stuck in a certain setting.

As for yesterday..All I was searching for was some genuine conversation. To feel that feeling again that everything ok..And yet all I could do is see whets bad. Not "bad" just different I guess. I fear my love is running out of things to talk w/ me over. I bet its distance that's making me freak out. I just get sad when I think of how our conversations get shorter and shorter..Less personal. I fear when I say "I love you" I'm being pushy..
I don't quite know whets wrong w/ me. Watch me ruin everything as I'm so used to anyhow. I cry so bad when ever I think of hurting this person..Or that w/ me and this person nothing shall work out..Its like my world tumbling just at the thought. Oh and for the quencher..As this person goes thru changes and faces life decisions.. Here I am feeling like an ass for even expressing such doubts. The world doesn't revolve around you angmi ok?? Not everything is about you...As Carly Simon said it best "your so vein"  I'm realizing what that means. 

I can feel my stomach getting upset as I type..I'm so sick of being so sensitive to aches and pains..I need to be fixed already. I would Love just to get a new stomach as kiddish as that sounds..Here at a young age ive had surgery and prob after problems. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired!! I'm not too good w/ my meds tho..I was at first..Then back to the old ang routine I guess.  My body feels like its 45 yrs old while my mind feels at age 15..Immature and doubtful of all that's good..

Ang..Please chill out..You know you are loved so what is your problem?
Get a grip on life girl and be happy or things Will explode in your face as you pray they don't girl :P

      im so fucking confused. my mind is screwed up bad. i get my assurance that things are ok and yet as we talk im holding back tears at one point. tears because i wonder if for the other person the thrill is gone. its stated clear that its alive but why do i feel as if its not..why do i think/feel the things i do??? it bothers me and im sure it bothers others.. others involved..why cant i brush the devil off my shoulder?? 


Im not tired..im saddended...........inside comment

maybe i have a problem w/ comfort..comfort in the sense that things ..all the exciting things get flopped to the side and forgotten. GOD what is wrong w/ me.  Am i over reacting that i miss his whispered i love you's? or his desire to talk with me .. i write love poetry that i pour every inch of myself into and i feel funny afterwards..like here i am ..putting my whole self out there, when im half unsure (for some screwed up reason) of their feelings.. BUT WHY am i?  i know of their feelings..ive at one point felt the warmth they can bring thru my body..seen the smile they can bring to my face that lasts all day..so why am i so sad? cuz im screwed up in the head..this person is my everything and i feel as if my love for him ...i dunno he deserves better sooo much better:( i say that in the sense that i feel as if im ripping him off ..long distance love takes such a GD toll:( i miss his voice..i miss his face..i miss him being so excited about Us.  CRAP..if "he" is reading this im sorry i couldnt express this more on skype:( i didnt want to say not one word for id fall into tears baby. and im sorry i get like this..i dunno what the hell i want really..gd neon signs? i dunno why i freak when things either slow down or get into a routine comfort..makes me feel as if things are changing for the worse..my mind runs on "worse". i hate that, ive been like this since i started experiencing anything in life really:( Are my daily doubts gonna backfire on me and i not realize what an idiot my brain can be till its too late?:(? i pray not because i feel w/ out this person id fall and fall till i could not stop..no grips just freefalling. is my love greedy? maybe..thats the me i hate..      these things i wish i could say aloud...i create my own fears..why am i so down??

      Yes Yes i admit it I am. So..what I thought was the downhill slope of my lustful love interest, was all in my pathetic head. My mind runs in crazy directions and I just wanna take this opportunity to thank whomever may become entangled in my web of sillieness. Thats what Its seems like to me in the end..silly, silly how I think things and dwell on them until they take over me and depress me. Its a waste of time and energy..and not to mention non too good on a high stress case like me:P Tired eyes lead me to say G'night all whom read..dont read whatever ! My love to all whom I know do!

      ok so i havnt blogged in awhile, so what. Ive been too busy fighting w/ one and pondering another in my head. My mind runneths over but Ive been feeling outta the loop w/ a dear dear loved one. Things seem as if they are changing and change to me is scary. It could be just me and my over active over worrying mind, but I dont feel as if we talk the same.  :(  and this saddens me because this person is the one thing i wanna hold onto the most..But is expecting that someone to hold onto you as well too much to be asking..to much to expect? Why when it comes to love things get complicated and confusing ..and why does sometimes your mind play tricks on you..whispering things to you, that you in fact know arent true yet the more you hear them you wonder as well? Well..That feeling Sucks. If Im wrong I wish someone could scream it or at least come stamp it on my face so when i look in the mirror i see..!

      Day by day I wonder how many more times must I swallow my pride. I must go through the motions of my transition before I can go on any further. I spoke with my mother today and she heard me out with a lot of personal things, and told me I need to get myself together that way I'm ok when the shoe falls. This I all know, I need a lot of change in me first. Yet as my own person I feel like such an idiot because I feel so stuck in this situation. My husband is very manipulative..Very child-like..In the sense that he would go great lengths to act stupid just to see my reaction. He doesn't listen well..Back in school I was told by a friend/teacher that he had ADD and I blew it off...Figured whets to deal with? He translates whatever I may say, hears it different and blows it outta proportion and runs with it. Its disgusting..I could say (for example if he was too close to my face..) id say, "give me some space" and he translates that to..Oh you don't love me..Oh nope no.. You want me away from you..Then he'll sit and act kiddish and mean till I so stupidly give in a little just to make him civil to be around. Its exhausting. Day by day adjusting to so much attitude and tension. Today I think to myself..Its gonna be a civil decent day if I have to so much as fake it..Its gonna happen..So everythings going fine and I'm making a dinner..Nothing big but time consuming..And its ready and he walks in, looks around and says "I gotta figure out what I'm gonna have.." Naturally I am upset and say no, dinners ready right now..Please don't act like that..  For now I have to go ..I have yet to finish up..

      Yeah Yeah I'm here for life now..This is my only ok..Not only but most reasonable way to vent on a daily basis..I need that in my life. I'm wired and tired right now..Been up all day and night so far. Me and the a.m go hand in hand, ask my daughter! I'm currently going thru the roughest time I'll ever endure in my life. Too young to be saying that you think? Nope..Sorry..I have lived a lifetime of misery(granted not as bad as some..) in a few years. My marriage is past the rocks and dipping it toes in the water already..Its just a matter of who when what and where. My support from family...Down the toilet  nice eh? I need a transition of girl to woman..That- I feel yet as mature as I seem I'm held back in many many ways. I need to better myself that way when I do or he does decide to drop that final bomb, I can handle it and take care of my daughter the right way. I feel skillless..Like I couldn't even succeed at McDonald's. People say I'm wrong yet over the yrs I've gotten so unsocial and like.."outta the loop" that I just feel stupid and I have developed anti-social tendencies times 10. I smoke and I just seem to be smoking more during this time in my life..I am addicted to Mt. Dew..I have severe stomach problems yet I cant seem to take proper care of myself. See that's what I do..Take care of others and neglect myself..That's crap. Noone should really be like that.."You" should always come first..Really. I have had not ONE friend since highschool..Really makes a person feel grade a* special:( I have been very lonely considering I am married. I am only grateful that in this time of my life I have met somebody so special..So considerate and genuine..OMG he's the one I should've been with. DON'T THINK IM MEAN....I am so devoted here at home its sick so no-ones mind be runneth over when reading my blogs mkay!? This person is like my saneness..My strength..My whole heart. Together without physically seeing one and other have fallen into such pure love its just amazing..This is like the kind of love that I wish everyone in life could seriously experience. To be loved for who you are not what you aren't or "could be". A love with a listening ear and a heart of gold. Ok..Ok..My eyes are squinted so bad ..I'm in desperate need of some sleep. As for all who reads me..Get ready for alota' Angmi!

      What's the point in hope. What's the point in faith. What's the point of patience when it wears so thin? What's the point of life in general when its just depression and broken hearts? What's the point in making friends and lovers when they just are bound to hurt you and bring you down at some point? What's the point in comforting another when you are just shunned when its your turn for vulnerability? What's the point in giving someone a chance to come around when you just sit there growing hurt as you watch the clock tick on by? I'm almost learning a life's lesson here actually....Do not show or express love to another until you are sickly and crazily positive that the feeling is mutual. What's the point in doing otherwise when you in the end wind up hurt and have no legitimate answers?:(&nbsp; what's the point in trying to fix something when it apparently doesn't want to be fixed? Its hard watching something that you know is so huge and beautiful..Crumble to ash. Am I the only one who wants to succeed? Am I the only one who loves w/ their whole heart? Am I the only one who is still gonna care just as much as the beginning, when the end appears? I am tired of hurting..Tired of wondering what's up..Tired of wishing things had never changed..Yet needing to know why they did.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not stupid here..I see what's gonna happen, I'm just waiting feeling empty as hell:( I don't deserve this..Why doesn't anyone like me gd:( no one can have anything good with me..Or if they do they freak out and cant handle it:(&nbsp; this sucks..Feeling like you are worth shit&nbsp; Sucks:(&nbsp; having the one you love just want to hide from you and brush things under the rug, just kills. Excuse me for wanting answers and wanting things to be good. What's the point in giving my love when its practically handed right back to me, back in my very own hands:(:(&nbsp; its funny..you can think all you want about how people feel for you..Yet its their actions in times of need and repair that true feelings arise for all to see. What's the point in anything....Anymore :(&nbsp; good things never last..They might indeed stay true but some people cant handle a good thing. Well, when they want it..Will it be there? cuz I want it right now and previous times before but does it seem as if I have gotten such a thing?? No:( of course not. LOL I am so crazy for thinking anything good that involves me stays good. Everything I touch I apparently love to the death..kinda like squeezing a hamster too death..Your intentions aren't to kill just to fill w/ love:(

      All I can say at this point is I don't know what the heck is going on...About anything anymore. Sometimes, I wonder, what's the point of being in love with anyone in the world..When you are just gone be judged or hurt or betrayed or whatever. Its not fair at all if you ask me. Especially when you love someone with your whole being..Ha that's like walking into a live mine field. The biggest shocker of them all is to have someone not want to answer a question that should so simple to answer. The fact that they don't leads the other one to believe that things are not good and then fear sets in..And stays there until further notice. And really..I cant count how many times I've been reassured yet w/in a day or 2 I'm back to the same predicament. I just really don't understand. I was told I am over dramatic and that sunk into me and burned all the way in. I am me..Take it or leave it.&nbsp;Who is anyone in this world to say how a person should react to anything? We all have our own feelings, our own comfort zones and our own way of dealing and observing things in life. I myself would never down a person for dealing how they deal. Granted I may tell one to relax or remain calm yet I'd never say "hey you..you need to grow up and stop being so overdramatic"&nbsp; Caring is one thing but care and practical insults do not go hand in hand. That's like back when most of us were kids and we were spanked or beat and it was always.."We do that cuz we love you"-Crap..Well I'm sorry but that is really backwards. I am entitled to say that because that is my opinion. Love should be all about total understanding, faith and support. That, along with other things but those are most important to me. Also a love that is mutual...What good is putting your whole entire heart and soul on the line when in the end you find out you weren't loved as much..That that love you expressed and found so true was in fact the killer in the relationship? God what a horrible feeling. I'm very afraid that at this point in a certain relationship of mine that- that is just the case indeed. I ask, is it in fact true and I get no answer except confusion from beyond so what am I supposed to think world..What the hell am I supposed to think:(&nbsp; ??&nbsp; A person can only go thru so much till they just are flat out scared of the inevitable. A person can only ask once to be loved in the same way they give themselves.

      my worst fears ive been writing of have come to life. as of this moment i am  emotionless, they have been stripped away. have ou ever put your whole self into someone..just to have them shock you one day and tell you that at times they wished you werent so "into them" 

you know what..its not even worth typing about..i am dead thats all that needs be known:(

      it floors me that my marriage has been turned upside down due to seriously feelings i had for another. because now that person claims he does not love me..what the hell:( just bringing up the subject of divorce in this house was the start of the worst and most scary part of my life. so one thing i can say to the one guy is thanks for everything. thanks for letting me put my heart and soul on the line, opening up my body to you and lifting my securities...cuz all that is fucked now so..

ive never felt so stupid and humiliated in life to know i showed another my body beyond belief and shared personal things. endless beautiful pictures only made for one pair of eyes, poetry sprouted straight from the heart...for what!??? people who give their all get nothing in return. oh wait, i did get something..heartache. since friday night i have never been more of a mess in my life. friday i layed in the tub for and hour and a hlaf just sitting there crying like a god damned baby..wanting to drown myself yet my kids in the other room:( i layed till the water went cold and even then it was like why move? why do anything. i now know what its like to seriously frown, my mouth seems to be locked in that very position. i cant laugh..i try but its like forced. i have been ignored for all weekend and still today and nothings ever hurt me worse. i did nothing wrong. i loved with my whole heart, i never lied, i tried to spread love so it could be seriously felt. i guess none of that works in the end. when you are told you are not loved the same its worse than a bullet to the head..cuz this bullet dosnt kill, it makes you suffer until it sees fit that the job is done. i just cant even officially come to terms w/ what happened here..cuz it seems left opened still. my soul is the pawn in a game that i dont like one bit. i am here waiting for even a sign of conversation and i get nothing..it hurts really bad. i guess i am the better one because i do not hide..as wrecked and messed up as i am now..i am here doing my thing. everytime i stop i think and cry so wtf! here i was thinking i was loved more than anything..loving that person in return and bam...you are nothing angie..nothing.  

i wish i could stop crying..dont eyes run out of this shit gd:(  my stomach is all screwed up..i am so nausiated at the drop of a hat. this pain is stress and this stress is what has been done to me..i did not deserve it at all. especially from that person...you know me..do i need that kind of treatment? what did i do to you that made you hate me so?:( all i did was fall in love with you..change my life to make room for you..became totally into you..made you promises i wished and was going to keep because i gave a shit..thanks for letting me know all this time i was a 1 woman show. its really nice being in a relationship that is 2 faced..makes a person feel REAL good:( so much for friendship..i wasnt stpuid, i knew id never hear from you again. this isnt you. i know it. i know your feelings and theres gotta be more wrong than i am told because i am what wants to be good in your life..you must be so used to living in shit that you fight a good thing..well so be it then. i hope you are happy. with how you feel and what you have done to the girl who is "so precious to you".

      So...I have got the hint i have been waiting for..Thankyou so very much. You just hurt me over and over..mend me when asked to and this is fun right??:( I am almost speechless at this point. My hands are shaking and I cannot think straight. NO I am not dumb or emotional..why should anyone who loves another take something so god damn lightly??? Go ahead..HIDE..thats all you ever do anyhow. Maybe you never loved me..cuz if you did..this would not be an issue:( this is ridiculous that I even have to be flippin out all hurt right now..but then again around you lately thats all you wish for me to feel. I am appualed..that for you my life has been turned upside down and this is what I get:( Fuck the confidence you helped me build..thats Gone..you took that when you took my heart and devoured it. You are the one true thing I have..the only person I have ever connected with 100%...go ahead..treat that as if its nothing. Apparently thats what I am to you. I really feel that way...Nothing. I opened my body to you beyond belief and put myself so far out on that ledge of judgment..all for this:( Can you not handle knowing you are loved..what the hell is it? would you rather feel lost in that area?? If so Fine, just know you had love and its never going away. God Damnit...This is terrible to do this to me..and yourself. ahahahahahaa why reassure me we are ok when this is the stunt you pull? You must think I am really stupid..I have known whats up for so long and yet I was good enough to keep around huh:(?? What was the point in returning an I love You when its two faced. Thats right..two faced. You say you love me yet you know all thru your days what you feel..nice of you to let me know ya know? So, I dont know what else..I take it nomore friendship either. Talking to you still I'd just be reminded of how much I adore you and grow to hate you for not wanting such a good incredible thing. So much for soulmates eh:( I really felt that in my soul. I felt as If I knew you and you knew me..guess not..the only one really into this relationship was me the whole time...WOW OMG...you really had me snowed haha omg I didnt realize this before!! wow you are somrthing else. You make me wrap myself in you just do drop me and watch me fall the endless fall..thanks alot. Delete ALLLLLLL my beautiful pics that were made Just for you, why have them if you dont want me..Im sure your precious computer could use the space. So there you go..I hope you are happy..you have killed the little bit of me that was still alive, the me that had hope for good to happen to her. Just forget me If you can. I dont have to stop anything I do..I f you see me just ignore me as you have been. Just judge me as you have been. One thing tho..you KNOW me so dont think crap of me gd:( Hope you are happy in your search for love and I hope If you find It, you treat It better and more precious than you did this one.:( I guess I f you ever decide to talk to me again i am here just dont expect happy loving ang to be there..just an empty girl with nothing..she used to have something..i guess she loved it to death:(

      Sometimes I wish you'd cut that dangeling string. You see the destruction yet I still hang freely. What am I to you? Just a midnight fling? We used to be attatched to each other, now It's just me left hanging from you. Leaving me feel like a immature child without a clue. Stop this hurt, Stop this pain..lets meet where we know we match. If not, then please drop the hint I have been waiting to catch.
