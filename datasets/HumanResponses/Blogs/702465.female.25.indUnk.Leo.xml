      ok, ok...I know that I am bad at this, I said that I would post more often.  Humm, so the majority of this week has been spent to reading this really good book, instead of readying myself for Turkey.  So since I am now in those last days of getting ready I am beginning to panic, just a little.  But this week has been fun, Tuesday night, I hung out with Dione and saw Scooby Doo, Wednesday night Anne, my house-sitting savior, came over to see the house, Thursday--um...I oh, I hung out with Dione, and then tomorrow I went out with Bryce.  I feel like I neglected Steph though, sorry hun.   So now, I am working on the last bunches of laundry before I start to pack.  Tonight I am at my parents and we are going to see a movie.  So even though I haven't been posting anything, at least you know that it hasn't been too interesting. Gotta go, dinner is ready.  I'll write later and give everyone my address in Bismil, if anyone is interested.

      Monday, monday, da da dadada da.... Exactly one week before I leave.  So, I wish that I had some momentous to write today, but I don't.  Everything that I have been putting off so far, has to be done now.  People at work want to see pictures, so I will bring them tomorrow.  My passport should be coming back from the embassy tomorrow, hopefully---I get nervous every year when I have to send it off.  And I have to clean my house before Ann comes to housesit for me.  I think that is the scary part of leaving-----I have some frightening glory holes to clean out---oh that and writing out all of my bills for the next three months.

      Hello everyone.  I am in Turkey now without my luggage---this is the second year that this has happened to me and I find it quite annoying.  I am really glad that I packed some clothes in my carry ons.  I learned from last year. We arrived in Diyarbakir last night, and will be heading to Bismil a little later today.  Our gov. rep is here, he seems to be really nice----please,please, let him be nice the entire time.  Bradley is at the police station trying to get us residence permits and we already visited the museum here.  So far everything seems to be going well---except that I don't have any baggage.   Nothing too exciting has happened so far.  The plane rides were long and boring--however I sat and flirted with the cutest guy on the Istanbul-Diyarbakir flight.  That was fun :) So I hope to write again soon---with luggage hopefully  Man, I totally forgot how difficult it is typing with a Turkish keyboard.  The "i" is in a different spot and there are two different types of them.  Also the ' , ? @ are all in strange and new places.

      Ok, well this is it.  The last day before I leave.  And I am just a little stressed.  It's almost 6pm, my laundry won't be done for another hour, then I drive 2 hours to Salt Lake.  When I am there I have to go to the lab, do probably close to an hour of copying, get a giant suitcase filled with stuff from Bradley, then pack---as well as printing a bunch of stuff off of my computer, and last minute cleaning of the house.  Oh, and sleep, a little. I had planned on leaving here about 3pm, but well, that didn't work.  Pete had the UTARP database up and I was working on it and helping him sort out bugs most of today and yesterday.  So that made me be behind.  I finally got around to messing with my finaces today, and discovered that I had estimated wrong and needed more money.  Thank God for my parents---but the figure of money that I owe my Dad keeps climbing and climbing.  One day, hopefully, I'll be able to pay him back--but that also might be the day I win the lottery. I know that it all doesn't seem like much, but is just enough to make me walk around the house crying because I stressed myself out too much.  Maybe, this could be the only emotional breakdown I will have this summer.  Wouldn't that be wonderful!  Last year i only had one emotional outburst like this, and Bradley didn't have to see it.  Compared to the following years that was amazing. Well, I guess another thing that really stressed me, and probably what set me off in the first place was that I got another e-mail from Erol.  Another case of him not listening to what I was saying again.  So that really, really frustrated me. And then underneath all of this, I am incredibly excited.  I am soo looking foreward to just going to Turkey and only having to worry about work.  No bills, no meals to cook, no rent to pay--well i still have to do laundry, but that's easy.  It's peaceful when I am there because I know that I am being useful and not running around in circles. I feel better now, I got to get this all out and off of my chest.  Thanks for listening. I'll update you next time from Turkey. Until then

      Not much else has been happening besides that of that.  Bradley announced yesterday that the van will not be coming back to get breakfast every morning---which basically means that I will never get to leave the house too see the site unless I want to waste an entire day of work.  Things have been progressing very well in the depo so far.  I am almost caught up with last years stuff--and the new incoming stuff have already been dealt with---the new system seems to be working out well.  All the small finds have been processed on a daily basis.  Everthing seems to be going soo smoothly that it makes me a little uneasy.  Could it really be possible that I could finish something that I had started?  Could this also mean that some of my crackpot ideas do work?  I will keep you updated. Oh and on a last note note--twice someone has told me that they thought that I was a local---I am not sure if that is a compliment or not--especially with my Turkish. Until next time

      Well, I almost did not get to have a day off this week, but I had to put my foot down with Bradley Bey and make him give me one.  So I spent last night in Diyarbakir.  It was not too much fun however since I was midly sick, I ended up sleeping all day.  I feel fine today. So not too much has happened this week, but my Tuesday incident with the cockroaches was enough for me.  Anyone who knows me well knows my absolute fear of cockroaches.  When we originally came to Bismil, Lynn had told me to watch out for rats and cockroaches in the depo.  Not what I had wanted to hear.  No rats soo far, but plenty of cockroaches.  To begin with I would come across the occasional one when I was back in the corner crates.  I could handle those, you scream, back away, and let them run.  It was a good policy.  However, when I got around to fixing out the crates towards the front of the depo, where everone organizes their artifacts when they come in from the field---we found an entire nest of cockroaches.  At first I had one of the little boys from next door helping me.  You had to pull out every artifact and put them into a "clean" crate.  By about the tenth cockroach that we had to kill he could not take it anymore and left.  It is important to note that this is also the first time that I have ever killed a cockroach.  I still had five stackes of crates to go.  Then this other girl came and helped me.  She was very proud of her not being afraid of them, in fact she felt it necessary to pick one up and show me how unafraid that she was.  But then the Haji--our landlord--saw her in there with me and shooed her away.  3 stacks left to go.  Now that I was by myself, I would take the crattes outside near the dumpster to "clean" them.  The whole neighborhood thought that it was really funny to watch me stamp on them.  By the time there was only two stacks left, there were so many cockroaches in the crates that I knew I needed help.  The entire time durring this, I am crying and completelly grossed out and on the verge of freaking out.  Drew came down to help me--he was my hero for that day--but when we got too the last crate I still do not think that either of us could have been prepared.  We had kicked it a couple of times, and managed to kill 10-15 escapees---I was not prepared for the thirty or so cockroackes to come scrambling out from under that crate.  If fact I screamed soo loud that four guys off the street rushed in to see if I was ok.  When they saw the problem they all started to help us stamp them out.  Afterwards the place looked awful---squeeshy bug býts everywhere.  I had to wait 2 hours before I could even venture down to the depo again.  When I cleaned up the mess--when the broom would run over some of the roaches they would start to twich again.  So I would have to stamp them again.  Most of the bits I had to scrap up.  I did not want to have any mental breakdowns this year, but I totally lost it.  After I calmed down, I could not sleep that night because each time I closed my eyes I would see the cockroaches.  I stayed up until I fell asleep from exhaustion.  Now I have no problem with killing the roaches.  I still jump a little.  We have started a daily kill count--the numbers are dwindling.  6 the day after, then four, then one.  I think that the word has gotten out to the whole cockroach community to stay out of my way.  Marco keeps calling me La Cocoracha.

      My luggage came.  that seems to be everyones main concern.  However this internet cafe in Bismil really sucks, so I will hav eto be brief.  I just lost an email that  I sent to Dione.   So we start digging tomorrow.  Howwever, I am in full dig mode---there is soo much stuff that I left behind in the depo.  But I am almost finished.  Finishing scares me a little, it sould be like the end of the world.  But in doing soo much work I am really sore.  Ibprofen and the occasional stiffy have been my friends. For anyone that is curious,yes I have seen Erol.  I have been barely civil to him, and so I think he has gotten the point, but you never know with that man. Well, everyone in my group is ready to go.  So I will leave you now.  I will write again on Friday---my day off---I can not wait. Until then.

      whoo...sorry aout that-the last two posts were supposed to go up last week but the stupid server here did not work. Unlike years past---I hate it here.  Bradley has been pissing me off a lot and I feel isolated and frustrated and well...it is not a good situation.  Needless to say, I can not wait until I can come home--55 days to go--I think that I am going to try and see if I can get a flight back earlier.  I think that it is the monotomy of everything that is getting to me. I get ignored for days on end and then I have to jump whenever Bradley wants something.  A lot of my anger at Bradley stems from a room promise that he made to me that fell though-and I got stuck in a room with 6 people--it was awful.  But I moved to our 3rd apartment the other day--we have soo many people we had to get another one--this one has roof access and I sleep up there-it gets cold up there at night and you need a blanket to sleep.  Everyone on the crew is here now-which is nice-and I have no problems what-so-ever with any of them--it is just Bradley at the moment.  Hopefully things will improve. Today is our day off---yeah! I went to the Bismil internet cafe earlier in the week and did not get anywhere with it--so it looks like I will only be able to update this page on Fridays when I am in Diyarbakir.  Hopefully next time I will be in a better mood. Until then

      Well, well, well--so much to tell and not enough týme at the interent cafe...  So I was pretty mad at Bradley for various reasons that I will not go into at the moment--so angry in fact that I was ready to pack my bags and leave for Diyarbakir--never to return.  I was not the only person who was upset with him--early this week there were 12 people on Cathryn's balcony complaining.  We all decided to talk to Andy first.  The next day Bradley came into the depo and said "Do we need to talk?" I said, "I don't know, do we?" At that point he decided that we probably should.  All in all he was hurt that I had not come to him earlier with my complaints-seeing that he saw me as a friend.  When I was able to establish that we are on "friend" terms I was brutally honest with him.  I could tell that he was hurt-but it did not seem to matter very much at the moment.  Every one should be soo proud of me--I cried but did not sob--which meant that I was able to talk to him the whole time instead of having to stop-compose myself- and start again.  I forgave him in the end-I am soo predictable sometimes. So yesterday we went to Hasankeyf for a few hours and then on to Dýyarbakýr.  We were pretty tipsy by the time we got to Hasankeyf and Bradley and I just hung out in this cafe that is half in the waters of the Tigris.  It was nice just to let my feet sit in the water-Bradley floated for a while-and just about everyone got wet to some degree.  It was fun.  I was in the party van the entire time-which was fun until Jakob, who is a diabetic and should not be drinking anyway, gpt sick and started to upchuck in the back of the van.  He then made Greer sick, who later got Jonathan sick.  I get really mad at people who can not handle their alcohol and expect me to pick it up.  I refused.  Stupid people. And I know that some people are wondering about the never ending Erol situation.  This year we only hired people that were requested by the different excavators.  Erol was not requested and therefore not hired.  He had asked Aziz, one of our foremen, why we had not been hired yet.  He was told that he was not welcome at the dig house becasue he was too familar with all of the women on the dig-not just me.  If he agreed not to come to the dig house he could be hired--he then decided to come too the dig house to get clarifycation-and will not be hired.  Again stupid people. That is all for now Until next time

      news flash--- Typhoid outbreak at Kenan Tepe dighouse--12 people affected---don't worry I am not one of them. Debbie announced to Bradley that she had changed her tickets to leave dismil Bismil early-regardless of the talk that she had with Bradley--result:  Bradley is taking it personally and refuses to talk or even acknowlegde her presense. Debbie returns home on the 6th of August.  Yippy Skippy! That is all for the moment- more at 11.

      I went to the doctor today and like usual the doctor has no idea what is wrong with me.  So I am on antibotics for the diaherra, and have a pain killer type thing that is to help with my stomach cramps.  The cramps are awful--I couldn't eat because they would get worse, or move alot because they would start to hurt as well.  I felt better today anyway so I believe that my system is fighting everything off. Called my friends today and checked in with them--they all sounded happy to hear from me and frankly it was nice just to be able to talk to them.  I am not sure when I will be coming back to Salt Lake.  My family intends to keep me at the house until I feel better-which is fine by me.  I think I can go and work at the bookstore again on the 19th, but I have to call them and check, and I also have to call my other job at SWCA to see if anything is going on there.  There is no way around it, I am going to have to take a second job this year, if SWCA falls through I will be open to suggestions on what line of employment I should seek:  lion tamer, stripper, window washer....  I'll have to take a poll on that one.  School starts on the 21st.  Yep that's all that is a goin' on.  yep yep yep that's it...  ok I think I will go back and watch some more of the cartoon network-cable is soo much cooler when it is at your parent's house...

      Well, I am home.  There is a lot to say and I am not sure where to start or even to bother trying to explain all the reasons why I left early.  Regardless of my reasons, Bradley is refusing to listen to them.  He is taking it extremely personally, which annoys me on many many levels.  But the end result is that I have no regrets about leaving.  In fact leaving everyone on the dig was the hardest and bravest thing that I have ever done---yes, even braver than the cockroaches and going to a movie by myself.     I am not going to write very much at all today---the Bismil special traveled back with me to the states and I have been running to the bathroom every few minutes.  Hopefully tomorrow everything will be better.  But I just wanted to let everyone know that I made it back home--with all of my luggage ;)

      It feels strange not having to do anything in particular each day.  This week has been strange- and yes I know that it is only Monday-but I am going on a week here at my parent's house.   I have read a bunch--mostly Harry Potter at the moment-I have forgotten how many times I have read those books by now.  And I just finished another one, so I am trying to decide what to do now.    My family and I went up to Spanish Fork today and saw the movie Signs--it was pretty good-with a twist. Tommorrow is Jimmy's appointment with the therapist and my parent's want me to go in and talk to the guy before the session.  I think they think that is will help the therapist understand Jimmy better if he meets the eluvise older sister.     There are odd little things that I have to do before I go back to real life but I am spacing them out along the week so that I will have something to do each day.  How do housewives do this everyday?  TV is boring-but we did get the Cartoon Network finally-but that even gets boring after a while.  The laundry is already done and the house is clean and it isn't time to start thinking about making meals yet.  I could spend my time writing emails to everyone that I know, but I don't have anything else to say.  The only reason why I continue to type here now is that I like the sound my keyboard makes when I type- I feel useful and productive.     I think that I will give my turtles a bath.  It is nice to share a room with them again.  Back in the dighouse in Turkey, the fan that was in the lab made this tiny squeak each time it oscillated-it sounded just like the noise that the turtles make when they are restless in their tank.  So whenever I was working I would hear that noise and think of them.  Sometimes when I look at them and talk to them-yes I talk to my pets- I half expect them to smile back at me.  Maybe I have had too much of Harry Potter and the cartoon network...

      Ok, long time since I have written--and honestly I don't know if anyone reads these but I have stories to tell anyway.  So, I am back at my house in Salt Lake now, and I have met the new neighbors.  They are 3 guys; Josh, Patrick, and Trevor.  Very sweet but they are not the brightest lights in the store, of you know what I mean.  School started last wednesday.  I have been working at the bookstore--close to 40 hours this week, and at SWCA -only under 10 hours there.  So I have been very busy and actually quite tired, but I feel pretty rested today.  The one upset since I last wrote was that Bradley gave me a C as a grade for the field season in Turkey this year.  Can you believe that?  A C!  The grade was obviously given on personal grounds.  I willhave to talk to him to get it changed when he gets back in mid-sept.  If he refuses to change the grade I will have to go over his head.  I am totally going to fight this one.  I think that it is my right.  Besides I worked for a full six weeks, 12-13 hour days, 6 days a week---plus I had to pay for the credit out of my own pocket----yes, I think the grade deserves an A.  However, Bradley promised that he would give anyone who took it for credit an A---I guess that it is just another example of him breaking his promises.

      Over a month...ouch, I am a lazy ass, aren't I? Unfortuately not too much has happened lately, I just seem to be really really busy.  The only time I see my house is the half hour to hour from the time I get up until I leave, then from when I return home until I go to bed. So an update on the Bradley thing....   I contacted him when he returned, he wouldn't speak with me, and accused me via email of single-handedly ruining the dig.  Quite a feat, but apparently I was pretty good at that task and lacking in everything else.  He even said that I "incited a rebellion", yes, yes, I know that I look harmless...but be careful!!!!!!!!!  I'm evil.  heeh heeh heeh (that's my raspy evil giggle-is it effective, do you think?)  Ultimately, I felt that Bradley was being an immature whiner and I had to go to the chair of the department to plead my case.  The chair was unusually happy that someone "was willing to stand up to Bradley", and he thought that I had a strong case.  But he later changed his mind and sided with Bradley.  Although he said that he would support me if I wished to pursue a more public redress against Bradley, but ---me beingthe egotisical person that I am---decided that I don't want to give Bradleythe satisfaction of winning twice, in this respect.  So I am petitioning for a withdrawl of the class from my record.  I turned in my keys ages ago, which was kind of sad, I have had keys to Carlson hall for 4 years now.  I haven't seen Bradley since I have returned, and I am also taking a class from Janet, which is not weird at all---she is soo much cooler than he is.  And another annoucement on the Bradley front is that everyday I am needing less and less gossip on Bradley to make myself feel better--soon, I will never talk about him again!  whoo hoo!  Okay, well it's important to me anyway.          So on to regular life.  I am doing the two job thing and school at the moment.  On wednesday nights I work until one in the morning so that I can listen to Greer's radio show on KAMP student radio.  (Wednesday nights 10-12pm arizona time, live via the internet at Http://kamp.arizona.edu, check it out, lots of fun)  So last wednesday night I work late, get home 1- 1:30, asleep by 2.  My alarm is set for 5am.  I snap awake at 8am.  I just stared at the clock thinking that I should be somewhere, but I couldn't remember where, because I couldn't remember what day it was.  So I got up started to get dressed and almost fifteen minutes later realized that it was infact Thursday and the possible Friday that I thought it was, and that I was late for my class that begins at 8:30.  That was the excitement of the week--but next week will be better, I have the opera on Monday night. So until next time, which I promise will be sooner, me

      well something of interest happened today----I got the Bookstore scholarship.  It is $500 to cover my books and school supplies for a full year.  I can now total my scholarship at the staggering figure of $600 for my entire college career.  Anyway, having this scholarship makes me happy! Happy, happy, happy!  That was about it for the day though, I found out that I might be able to take my third year of Turkish this summer at the U.  Another happy thing.  Also Tuesday is my nap day---I come home for lunch---so I guess naps make me happy too.  So today must have been a happy day. Another thing that makes happy is the new DSL line that I got.  Now I can watch Turkish television at home--hooray for cheesy turkish movies and music videos!!

      before I forget, I have a complaint to voice.  I am just gonna smack the new neighbors.  About a month or so ago my family was staying over at my house and the boys upstairs decided to smoke pot.  Now it was soo strong that I knew they were smoking in the house, and furthermore I knew that they were smoking in the basement.  This presents a problem for me because only a door separates the basement area that they use and my apartment.  At the time, I tried to downplay it with my parents, but I was a little embarassed.  Later that week, I talked to one of the three who swore that it was their friends smoking and that they were not in the house.  So last night, 7 pm, I am in my house with Dione and I start to smell it again.  Strong too because it was close.  We were about to leave to see a movie, so before going I went in the back to see if they were outside.  They weren't.  No lights were on in the house, but the basement lights were on.  Hummmm...what am I supposed to think?   After the movie, we came home and my house reeked.  I just did laundry yeasterday too, and now everything smells like pot.  So I go storming upstairs and ask the guys upstairs not to smoke in the house ever again.  Oh course they played dumb, "ahh, no one was smokin' in the house.."  but when I mentioned that the smoke started at 7, they started to have this guilty look on their faces.  Then they promised that they wouldn't smoke in the house anymore, "anymore"  meaning that they had been and that they had lied to me about it before!!!!!!!!!  So now my house smells like stale pot, and the smell is cycling around the ventilation system so that every time the heat kicks on I can smell it again.  Candles don't help, either does incense, and I am not sure that they have made a bottle of frebreeze large and strong enough to take away the smell.  can you see why I am a little upset.

      So the stupid server kept giving me these error messge saying that there was a faulty template, so I would keep coming back to the site hoping that it would work and then it wouldn't, until this evening when the bright idea hit me-----if I change the template it might work right.  and... viola!  I am writing to you once again.         Last Friday was a pretty cool day at job number 2 (SWCA), see whenever anyone builds anything across BLM land they have to have an Arch. firm survey the area.  Then after the survey is completeing they have to have a representative from that firm moniter the construction workers to make sure that they don't dig through a site.  Well, last Thursday our current big project was working on a pipeline out near Nephi.  No sites had been found for miles around and there was no evidence in the baulk that there was any cultural remains, so they were digging away...until the backhoe operator noticed something odd sticking out of the back fill pile.  Upon investigation they found it to be a human femur.  Somehow they had managed to go through an entire burial without any evidence in the baulk.  There was no coffin or cultural remains to be found either.  So my firm has a crew out there now sifting through a pile of dirt 10 meters by 4 meters and about 2 meters high.  But back to Friday morning, they needed to know how many bones they had collected so far, but they didn't have time to wait for Chick to sort them all out-----so they let me do it.  :)  It has been forever since I took my bone class, but I did ok.  I was just so excited that they let me do it---they trusted a lowly lab monkey!!!   small things make me happy.      also speaking of small things making me happy, I got my DSL line hooked up today, this also makes me happy because I can check the email and talk on the phone at the same time, not to mention the amazing internet radio oppurtunities now available to me.  good day ...

      Ever have one of those days when you are afraid that you have become incredibly boring?  No?  Oh, well, guess that I can't symphaize with you then.  See I am actually afraid that I am getting boring, or maybe it is because I don't seem to have any stories to tell.  So if nothing interesting happens to me anymore then I must be boring. Right? Right.  Hummm...I'll think on that. It's Ramadan again, this is day number 3 of the the fast.  It isn't too difficult this year, but that is probably because I am so busy, I have a feeling that this weekend will just kill me.  I forgot to get up early this morning to eat breakfast.  So I slept an extra two hours, and although the hunger has much harder to deal with today, it was nice not feeling sleepy all day.  I still feel tired though, the sleep deprivation is so acute at times that I stumble around like I am drunk.  Luckily for me everyone who sees me doing this, thinks that I am just horsing around. Oh, last week sometime, I ended up buying two rugs on eBay.  They came today.  They are Buhara's from Uzbekistan (and for you geography buffs out there, that is where the city of Buhara is).  I got them for cheap $1, plus shipping and handling, which came to $30---either way these rugs are a deal.  They are pretty big to 4x6 feet.  So if you want a cheap rug, go to eBay and search under Uzbek.  It's pretty cool. Anything else?  I think I had a hallucination this week, I am not sure.  On Tuesday or Wednesday morning, my alarm went off and I was kind of trying to wake up.  Then I noticed someone walking into my bathroom.  I could see through the person, they had a faint outline.  The weird thing is that she looked just like this girl at work.  So, I am watching this thing walk into my bathroom, then she bends down as if she is getting water from a water cooler.  She fills up her glass and then turns, leaning up against the sink, drinking water, and staring at me.  Well, at first I thought that I was half asleep and dreaming or something like that, so I closed my eyes and opened them again.  She was still there!  Then I closed my eyes, turned my head to face the wall, opened them again.  I slowly turned my head back to face the bathroom and....she was still there drinking her water.  I was beginning to get annoyed and a little freaked out at this time, because 1, normally blinking once or twice makes the things that I see go away, and 2, I really had to go to the bathroom and I couldn't because someone was in there drinking water!!!  My bladder finally won the battle so I got out of bed opn the opposite side, not the one facing the bathroom, walked around the bed to the bathroom and she was gone my the time I got there.  Which was good because I got to pee.

      Well I actually did something this weekend.  I know, I know, you are all wondering how I manage to have a sicial life, but yes it is possible.  Friday night I went with Stephanie and Ryan to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they weren't very in to it though, so I kind of felt stupid for doing the Time Warp with as much vigour as I did but oh well.  They also won't let you bring in your own props anymore, you have to buy them.  It wasn't too expensive, but packing your own stuff has always been a kind of hightlight. Then Sat. night I went to Halloween party given by the secretary of the History dept.  She was concerned that I wouldn't come if Bradley was going to be there, but the idea didn't bother me at all, heck, I lived with the guy for 3 weeks without him talking to me civilly, a couple hours at a party would be nothing.  The party was nice though, I didn't talk about school or work the whole evening so it was kind of relaxing. So, I am still enjoying the wonders of the DSL line, the new thing in music downloading.  A friend told me about this free site and that has been my fasination most of the week.

      and another thing... I have been hyper emotional the past two weeks---no it isn't my period, it ended a week and a half ago---but I was in the car driving home and the song "american pie" came on the radio.  After a few minutes I was crying so hard that I couldn't sing along anymore.  the sad thing is, I don't know what I was so moved..

      so I realized a couple of minutes ago that i have gone the entire day without talking to anyone.  It feels strange, I have lots of things to tell but I seem to be so busy that I never get a chance to talk with anyone, but I think about telling people stuff and then I forget that I haven't actually told them yet...does that happen to anyone else?

      so I am home in Price for the Thanksgiving weekend, and instead of doing my homework what am I doing?   Watching the James Bond Movie Marathon on TNN.  So here is what I have learned: 1.  Evil henchmen always wear uniforms. 2.  The villian is always willing to tell the good guy the entire plan. 3.  It is no problem if you leave your equipment behind you, no one will ever find it. 4.  Who needs a cover, just use your own name. 5. The worst possible puns-as-pick-up-lines will always get the beautiful girl to go to bed with you. 6.  The bad guy always seems to have a cat. 7.  You always win the fight, no matter how many people you are against, or their size; also you rarely bleed, bruise, or mess up your hair. 8.  You always discover the plan just before the villian is about to impliment it. 9.  Everything can be blamed on the communists, be it the Russians or the Chinese. 10.  The only sophisticated way to gamble is to play craps on borrowed money in a tuxedo.

      so since the last time I wrote finals have come and gone.  I didn't stress them at all, but then again I only had two of them.  This might prove to be my best semester yet.  I should do the incredibly busy thing more often.  So now, I am just working.  I was supposed to go to work early but I didn't, I felt that sleeping a bit more would do me a bit of good.  It did.  Lately I have been soo tired that when I get up in the morning I feel this weight in shoulders.       Oh, yesterday morning I got a call from Erol.  Normally those distrub me greatly, but not yesterday.  He kept trying to speak to me in english, which I guess is a nice gesture on this part.  But I couldn't understand him and we held the entire conversation in Turkish.  Now normally I panic when I have to speak on the phone in Turkish, but I did really really well.  He asked about the weather and my family, and Chuck who he had been trying to call.  The conversation was a couple of minutes too, not the normal 60 sec it usually is.  So my success in Turkish on the phone made me happy all day, so it is kind of odd that I was happy that Erol called....strange, that might take a while to figure out.    What else is happening?  I got promoted to lead worker at the bookstore, it means a pay raise and now I have the authority to boss people around.  I bossed them around anyway, but now they can't challenge me on it.

      I just reviewed all of my entries, and I realized that the end of the pot smoking neighbors hasn't been told.  When I came back from Christmas, there was three days of stale pot smoke squeezed into my house.  I was gagging the entire night.  That proved to be the last straw, I called Jill again to complain.  They happened to be in town for the holidays and came over to the house, smelt the smell themselves and notified the upstairs neighbors that if they get one more complaint about smoke that they would receive their notice.  I know that the guys aren't happy with me, but I really don't care.  I enjoy being able to come home in the evening and smell absolutely nothing.  I bought a handheld voice/tape recorder the other day.  I hope that this will help me with my writing.

      happy new year I have been busy and sick as of late.  My system crashed after school ended, but I feel better now.  Even though I was soo busy last semester I did really well--I got a 3.8 GPA. But I really wrote because I am annoyed.  Against my better judgement I checked out the UTARP website--boy was that stupid.  I have been removed from the crew list.  Which definitely means that Bradley never ever intended to talk to me again.  He wanted to avoid potential confrontation with me soo badly that he is letting this all end openly.  I hate his unproffesional behavior, and I pity him personally.  I guess that to everyone but me, this all means absolutely nothing, I don't think that I can make anyone understand. The new semester has started.  Man, semester opening at the bookstore has just been hell, but I enjoy it and I seem to have adapted well to my new leadership responsibilities.

      So today I am at work, and as of yesterday at 10:30am I had finished the last bit  of work that I have to complete until, say August.  So I figured that maybe I  should amuse myself during my breaks by writing a bit.  Being efficent is a pain.   Everyone else has work to do, and although I have asked if they need help, no  one really needs it.  So now I am back to inventing work for myself. Which I will go back to in a few minutes.  I have been helping Debra with little  things here and there, which is nothing to me, but I guess quite a lot to her, and she keeps buying things like doughnuts for me in the morning.  Which I eat.  But I feel a little guilty because I don't bring anything in for her.  I will soon,  I just have to wait until payday because I am absolutely strapped for money. This last weekend was a little interesting, as my father (accidently) hit me in the head with a plumbing snake.  But to both of our defenses, neither thought that it would spring out of the package like it did.  So I had a bit of whiplash and a massive headache this weekend, which still is not going away.  I am almost wondering if it triggered something off in my head... humm.. I hope not. Going back to  having headaches every day sucked. So I am going to close, remind me tomorrow to tell you about the book that I have been reading.  It's weird.

      So last night I finished Justine by the Marque De Sade, and even though I have been reading it for over a week or so, last night was the first night that I had a dream that stemmed from the book.  I dreamed that my Dad was mad at my Mom for the debt he had accrued from some finacial scheme he had undertaken.  To get back at her he allowed the people he owed money to, to come and rape her. He wouldn't tell me how much he sold her out for, and I suspected that he did it for free.  I  was so angry with him, because he had no sympathy for her, and said that it was  all her fault to begin and that she was being justly punished.  It was a very disturbing dream, espeically because my father was so angry in the dream, and I had never ever seen him so cruel.  Stupid De Sade.  Anyway Justine is an interesting book, and if you have a strong constitution I would recommend it.  But be warned it is highly pornographic, coupled with a lot philosophy.  Justine is an orphan who is highly religious and very protective of her "virtue", but her naivite makes her a very easy target and she seems to constantly finding herself to be a  sex-slave for every weirdo imaginable in France.  I know that you are supposed to  have compassion for her character in the book, but by the end, I just wanted to slap her upside the head, and I was glad that she died at the end.  Thinning of the herd and all that. I am going to read more of De Sade's stuff because it is quite interesting, but I am going to read a light novel next and then go back to it.  The dream was very disturbing so I need to cleanse the palate a bit. So today is Tuesday, of the work that I need to finish for today it will take me  less than 15 minutes.  It is just barely 9am, and I have already read all the newspapers.  And today I am finally getting my root canal, yeah.  I know that sounds strange, but I have been waiting for over a month for it.  And I have finally gathered enough funds-without my parent's help-but they gave me money for it anyway just in case--They are so good to me.  So that's it for now. Later

      So I decided not to go to my parent's this weekend, and I am now just hanging at home.  Since my recent -must lower all spending--spree, I am now reduced to the slowness of dial-up.  I have been waiting for the Microsoft XP updates things and it is only 53% complete, and I swear that it has been over an hour. so now just passing the time, although I relaly should get dressed and go out.  Libby and I went to X-wife's last night, played pool, and had 2 pitchers of beer, which meant that we were quite tipsy at one point.  On my second glass of water in the sober-up-to-drive-home-ritual the power went out at the bar.  We were there for 45 minutes or so, hoping that it would come back on.  It didn't, and I really didn't want to stumble to the women's restroom in the dark for a second time.  So we left, but walked around a little before we got in the car. Here is the really sad part.  the power went out around 10:30.  We are such little old ladies, 10:30 is my bed time, the idea of staying out really late is well, unthinkable.  62% complete.  God this will never end.  so I am watching Invader Zim again, I wonder when Libby is going to want her DVDs back, probably later today--I know that she is going to see Colin tonight Looked for more Tarkan pictures for my desktop background.  I hate to say it but I was getting tired of my Queen in drag picture.  Just not enough hot travestite pictures out there for me.  Not that Queen were transvestite, and I definitely have never seen a picture of Tarkan in women's clothing, but definitely there is something incredibly sexy about a man that that walk well in heels.  best song quote that I have heard in a long time "You are the best mistake I never made" David Bowie, Survive.

      continuing on with the saga of friday morning.  I felt really good this morning walked into work all relaxed, and when I think about the morning, I feel relaxed and happy again.  humh..that's nice.  however.  When I did come in, JB announces that she has finally finished the DOE  report (YEAH!) and then proceeds to just butt into all of the other stuff that I have to do, but she feels that she has to follow up on.  I've done my work-geez! Of course, this doesn't sound like much but it just adds to the impending doom of the week following her surgury.  The Chrony guys came in today to discuss the contract for next year.  She was barking demands at them, and orders at me (and I wasn't even in the room). Later on she apoligized, in a flighty off-hand way if she had been rude, and said that if she ever did anything that I could just tell her.  But I don't think that she would like the list that I would come up with.  I really felt sorry for the Chrony guys, it was brutal and it sounds as if she was in the full bitch mode.  Also afterwards she kept talking about the contract that SHE was going to sign.  She  can't, only "I" can, and I hope that her behavior is going to warrent another "now I am the director, not you" speech.  I hope I hope I hope  28 buildings on campus closed today because the power is out.  The University  has its own substation so that isn't really good at all.  It is fine in here, but I think that the air conditioning is off.  That really isn't a big deal because they have it turned up soo high in this building on a normal basis, that we are surviving quite nicely on the buildt up cold.  For some reason though my desk is covered with little gnats.  Most annoying, I might have to spray  raid in here again. and for some reason the hall lights are only half on, so  it makes if feel like it is the last day of school in here.  Like I really  should be goofing off.  Not that I have a lot to do anyway. I am back on the long list of things to do today.  And for clarification the "long list" is a  list of things to be done (like making electronic copies of old files) that will make absolutely no difference in the grand scheme of things if it is done or not.  But it does keep up the illusion of extra efficence.  Technically I  could sit at the desk and read, waiting for the phone to ring, but for some reason I feel guilty whenever I do that.  At least typing at the computer makes it looks like I am doing something worthwhile.  I don't know though, is it?

      I know, I know. It isn't even 9 yet. But she so quick this morning.  See last night I went to bed with one of those "anything can happen" feelings.   Like sparks were coming off my skin.  And just before I went to sleep I was  focusing on how wonderful the breeze felt upon me.  I had strange yet pleasant  dreams.  And it took at lot of energy to get out of bed, just because Friday mornings I don't want to move.  I love Friday and even though I rarely go to Friday prayers, I still feel quite at peace with myself and the world.  However... I don't think that whatever day of the week it is, the day is the same as in this office. dang, I'll get back to you in a little while JB is hovering.

      I have done so well today, it is only 4:30 and I am blogging. My Back: PAT PAT  Well I finished everything on my short list today (the long list keeps getting  shorter day by day) and I even started on the little pidily things that Debra has laid aside for me to do "When I Have Time", or basically little things that  Mandy asked her to do but she couldn't really be bothered.  This new item is to re-type all of the name labels for the employee files (37 to be exact) and put  them in the longer file label holders than the shorter ones that they are currently in.  Apparently she intends for me to do this task the entire week that she is  gone on her surgury.  Hummm... I don't know, that might take a while...15 minutes a half hour...I'll be swamped. Oh, and from here on out Debra will be known as "JB", just in case she happens to  check out my screen and I am bitching. JB also reminded me that when she is back from surgury that she will need a lot of help with things like typing.  She types everything, including reminder notes to HERSELF.  Post its, what are those?  Ever since she mentioned that today I have  had this creeping sense of dread....she is going to try to make me her  OFFICE SLAVE  which I will end up doing because I am nice, don't want to create any office friction ---thank god she is a temp only---and I always feel sorry for weak creatures.  I might like her better if she was a squirrel or a chipmunk.  So last night Libby ended up leaving her DVD's of Bowie and Invader Zim at my  house...guess what I will be doing..oh yeah.  All day today I have been listening to Bowie's Earthling album.  It's good and I love it, but I have listened to it 7 or 8 times today---I am just too lazy to change the CD.  Hummm... well I have exhausted all my thoughts for today.  Guess I will double check the website tracker (it hasn't been working well today) before I go.   Maybe I can make that take up 12 more minutes.

      so also in the effort of utilizing my time as effienctly as possible I took an online IQ test.  the results: 127 IQ for me, and I am considered as a "Insightful Linguist: highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer and the  visual and spatial strengths of an artist." That's nice.  I like it.  But it also means that I will never make the big bucks and therefor I cannot spend the such and such amount to purchase their 15 page report which dissects my mind based on 50 questions.  the Libster is coming over tonight.  We are going to watch Invader Zim and David Bowie videos before she goes and sees Colin after his rehearsal.  humm...anything else.  I have actually listened to music at the office today---I forget sometimes and then wonder why it is so quiet... today Turkish Pop: Mustafa Sandal and Tarkan...yumm...  Oh look! Only an hour left of work... yippee!

      well, I wanted to murder Debra earlier today, but I have clamed down now.  Just  a few comments that she made just hit me wrong.  First, as we were going to the  English office to pick up some binders, she says "Oh I should have worn my blazer" I asked why, it was hot outside. And she says that we are going over as reps of  the center and we need to look professional.  Hummm... last time I checked this  was a casual office, and I thought that I looked fine.  Ok so maybe I am not wearing panty hose, but that shouldn't matter anyway.  Second thing of great  annoyance, it that I goofed up and forgot to ask someone who made an appointment  with "I" and I forgot to find out what exactly they wanted to see him about.  So he is lecturing me a bit on it, which was fine, because he wasn't mean, and it  was definitely his place---but Debra was sitting there right next to him nodding her head as if she was agreeing with the preacher. Stupid woman, I don't think that she really realizes what a snot she comes off as.  Finally got the taffy for "I" today.  The place has weird hours so I had to be late for work today (but I worked late yesterday so that's alright).  But when a  place opens at 8 and at 8:10 their door isn't opened yet, I get a little annoyed. When I finally got in the owner had to ask someone how to work the register. But the taffy is addicting and to feed the need, you have to put up with a little.  we are trying to finish the 2nd DOE report, and everyone seems to be a little  testy. and I mean beyond the level of average annoyance around here.  I have re-edited the narrative already and done the class sheet.  So now that just needs  to be entered into the system (Debra's job), besides that the budget should be  all that is left.  "I" wants it all in by today--seems plausible to me, but "D" works on a different time than the rest of us.

      Oh Forgot to mention... I had a dream about Dione last night.  She was trying to leave/move but her car was blocked my 6 feet of snow.  And of course, she couldn't shovel and was just whining about it so that someone else would do it for her.  So I picked up the snow which was in slabs--weird, and cleared a path for her.  Then she got mad at me because I wouldn't help her move the rest of her stuff, and then she took her  truck and ran over my car a bunch of times. Dammit.  I guess that she has moved away, nobody really knows, and I am not sure that I care enough to find out. I was talking with my mom about it the other day and I questioned myself "Do divorced people feel this same sense of relief?"  AHHH!!! More stupid fax junk mail!!!I hate this stuff.

      Blah blah One of those days at work already.  I come in and there is an empty tissue box on my desk...why you ask?  Because Debra who is operating under the assumption that I am her personal secretary and not the OFFICE secretary, couldn't find the energy to walk over the supply closet and get herself a new box of tissues.  Then she  wanted to have them moved over to this office.  Why?  There is no room for them,  that is why we have a storage closet. Duh. Just get off of your skinny ass and walk.  Last night Libby and I went on a condom search (she and Colin are out again), the trip was successful, but also reminded me that the condoms I bought forever ago will expire next March...the 4 year celibacy anniversary is looming... after our search we went over to the bar and had a beer, because we could. Normally we play pool, but decided against it--so we just "hung out" in our nerdy way and made plans to have a study day at the bar.  Forget going to the coffee shop and reading over a cup of joe, a pitcher of beer would be better. Hell, I have had a study drink forever, I might as well make it public.  Set up a web tracker for the Center's website.  It's addicting.  I can sit and watch in realtime everyone who visits the site.  The power is scary, but my boss thinks that I am a genius for setting it up.  I'm not, but since the girl that was here before was such a slackass I appear to have superhuman secretarial  powers...muhh haa haa

      Stupid frigging computer. ... So i actually started writing a while ago and the computer was operating in that super slow mode, where you type and wait type and wait, and then the computer finally catches up you.  If you type too fast it forgets what you were trying to type and it comes out in garbled mess.  So the only way I have figured out how to get rid of this is to just restart the computer.  This is the second time today!! Damn you Elmer!  That is the name for my computer.  It's a transvetite (or would it be a transexual? A drag queen? I think that I like Transvesite better).  When she is sweet she's Ethel, but when he's bad he is Elmer.    It is very very quiet today.  The sound of an office without JB is such *sniff* such *sniff* a beautiful thing.... I think I need a moment.... ... ... ... ... ... ... And back to reality.  I have tried to take a lunch today, I really have..but since I felt like sitting at my desk and answering my email, and even with the door to the main office being up with a sign, I still got bothered.  And it wasn't from people off the street, oh no...it was from the people who also work in the office..Read the sign and let me be!  So I figured that I would just not feel guilty at all about reading at my desk, which I actually haven't done yet.  But give me time.  I wanted to listen to some Bowie, but I didn't have any with me today--it is in my car, so I am listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs real low, hoping that no one will get offended.  Since I haven't really been able to sit and eat uninterrupted I have been eating bits of my rather scanty lunch as I go along, selective snacking.  The printing services office had their open house today.  For the entire month they have been sending out these obnoxious flyer/card thingys once or twice a week.  Talk about the non-suspense leading up to a anti-climax.  June and I walked down there today to see what they had: punch and cookies, pens and paper, and an offer of free copying for today.  Nothing too grand.  The punch was the typical Mormon punch fare that you get in this state, Apple juice mixed with sprite. The cookies however were oversized, that was pretty good compensation for the cruddy punch.  Their pens and paper pads are a little freaky, they say "On your desk...in your drawers"  is printing services stalking me in my office?! I don't know if I can handle any more extra paranoia coming from my office supplies.  Speaking of, my huge order should have some in today.  Awwh man, I wanted to play with post it notes and pens today.  The office depot man must not like me today. Last night, K sent me an article to edit.  Oh goodness it was...well not something that he should send out to the public.  I gave him my honest opinion (the I have to be mean in a nice way kind) I hope that he re-edits it.  And I hope that he will talk to me afterwards, but I haven't heard from him yet.  I even had my mom read it, and she said that I wasn't harsh enough on it.  I had planned on reading it and commenting today, but when I glanced at it last night I knew that I couldn't wait on it.  Later my mom and I were talking about him, and she asked what sign I thought that he was.---His birthday is a rather complicated issue, because he doesn't know when exactly it is, because Kurdish babies in Turkey were rarely registered at the time of their birth, but somewhere in their first year or so, and a lot of mothers in the culture didn't place a high value on the time when their baby was to be born.  So he claims the 22nd of July but his mother can't remember if he was born in early spring or late fall.  And if I was a rural village woman, with not much education and 9 children in total, I might forget too.  Anyway, I drew a random guess at at Capricorn (A sign that I am not too familar with.. So we read the chapter in Linda Goodman's Sun Signs about the Capricorn Male, oh I hit it right on the head.  So what does this mean to me?  Well if I choose to reinvest my emotions in my dear friend K, with his personality I will probably not get the validation that my little Leo ego would like to get.  But I think that I could live with it, but I would still need to wait until he came around.  Ahh..yes.  the tribulations of my non-existant love life. Well I am gonna go, it is hitting the 4 oclock hour and I can waste enough time trying to tie up loose ends today to last until 5

      Odd thought really As I was walking to my car this afternoon, one of the trees along the path had been recently cut and the branches (which were full and green) were laying right where they fell.  It looked like they were praying to the tree.  JB goes in for surgury tomorrow and the week that she will be gone might extend to longer depending on how she feels.  I felt sorry for her, she was pretty scared.  June told me today that she didn't think that it was a good idea to talk to "I" about JB.  Thanks for you 2 cents June, but that is my decision to make anyway.  And that is, well I am not sure if I want to know or not.  She will only be there for about a month after her week off from surgury, and well...her manner seems to piss just about everyone off in one way or another.  This leads me to believe that all of her mannerisms are part of a fatal personality defeat that can never be cured.  On the level of annoyance she is up there with June to begin with, I just get JB in a larger quantity.  Observation:  a peanut butter and jelly pita sandwich is not a good idea.  Sandwich bread had a much higher level of absorbancy.  Grape jelly also has a pretty far squirting radius.  Nothing really happened the first part of today and I devoted it to sharpening my HTML skills.  Those that regularly view my page will notice the color scheme change.  It is a little odd but I kind of like it.  I want to change the MAL site so I am working on writing a new template for it.  I have the colors I want and an idea of how I want to place everything.  The Adobe GoLive program that "The Mec's" site is created in has totally spoiled me.  Then about 1-my usual lunch time- there was an opening with JB.  I needed to order supplies for "the Mec" before the end of the fiscal year (tomorrow) and she had just kept putting me off and putting me off.  So she finally got around to it, but would only work on it if I was in the room---I don't know why but I brought a notebook to take notes on so that I could fit that "secretary" archtype that I abhor.  Then June was in there whining about one thing or another and agruing with JB--I wanted to smack both of them.  Then June would leave and I would start to ask JB some more questions, then we would be interrupted my Beth, then she would leave and June would come back....I didn't manage to get my questions answered and out of JB's office until 3:30!  I got to spend $350 in office supplies though, which was fun. but I wasn't finished with that until 5 (it was a big order--cool)then I had to update the webtracker stats and dig out my desk to write a list of things to do for the morning.  I wasn't out of work until 5:45, but really 6 because I had to wish JB good luck and have her explain every possible situation that might arise while she was gone (she had to explain every one of those goofy typed memos to herself to me--ugh).  Working late and through lunch means that I have an extra 1.75 hours to leave early or late sometime.  Oh the possiblities.....  good news everybody:  I wore pants today.  Yes I know, you're thinking "Debbie spent a day not in a skirt?" Yes, it does happen.  And when I put them on today they were loose.  Party. Bonus.  An ad for a pilates class on NPR used the words "dynamic tension" and I burst out laughing.  Visions of Rocky Horror floating past me.  Tim Curry, yum.  I should go, the fam is invading tomorrow (we are going to see Shrek 2) and the house has to be cleaned.  I am not sure if it is only my father has the high standards of cleanliness, but they must be obeyed.  It shouldn't be too bad, if I just put the dirty clothes in the hamper and throw out all of the stupid junk mail that plagues me every week I should be fine.

      Well I am slowly but surely trying to make my blog all that it can be.  So the below picture is my lastest acheivement.  Not too much of one and the picture I chose was random. but hey, it's on the damn page isn't it?  and I want to do more with the template, but my HTML's skills are lacking.    so I decided that I should talk to "I" about JB.  This conclusion came after bawling to my mom on the phone for a couple of hours last night. I think that it is really important that I figure out exactly what my position really is at "The Mec" (as Paulie boy terms it).  I talked to June about it a bit today and she informed me that when Mandy was me (as in my position) she kept track of not only "I" but the AA as well, and when she became the AA she just kept on doing the old job and the new.  If that is really the case I should just chalk up her bitchiness to managerial styles and shut up.  I couldn't sleep last night, I was thinking about everything and nothing-and the little bit that I did drop off to sleep I was having weird work website dreams--this seems to be an regular Sunday night occurance and it ticks me off.  At 3 am I turned on the TV and watched the miserable reporters whose job it is to do the middle of the night news. but meet the press was on....I guess that they must re-air it.  Either way, I had a major brainstorm about ideas for the next lecture series at "The Mec" and was madly scribbling them down by the light of the TV.  By 4:30 in the morning I could sleep, but 7am wake-up was not pretty.  My eyes just hurt today.  But nicely enough, I was too tired to be bothered with her crap. She should be there only until the end of july, the end of july, the end of july...  if I keep repeating this mantra the world will become good and right again. please. I was so non-plussed with her today (I think that I am using that in the right context) that I even did the mundane job of retyping her file tabs---yes the task that was to take me a week, and yes, it took a half hour....but I streched it out to a full hour.  hee hee my office laziness skills increase!  from yesterday's dance class I taught my knees are killing me.  I really hurt them in January ---for those of you that don't know, my car and I got in a little bit of a "fight" and I got dragged a bit---and the way that they hurt now, I really screwed them up.  I would go to the doctor (I didn't when it happened because I had no insurance then) but I fear the news will be quite depressing.  Ann and I were going to work out today but she had a dentist's appointment.  Although I didn't work out at all when she was gone in Chicago last week, and I was looking forward to starting up again this week, I'm glad that we didn't meet today.  I think that I am going to need a cane soon.  being paid every month on the 7th and the 22nd each month turned out to be bad this last month.  I was so excited to empty my checking account for rent of the 22nd that I forgot my own anniversary.  June 22nd marked my 3 year anniversary of being Muslim.  On 6/21/2001 somewhere around 5:30 am in Istanbul I took the Shaahda.  That was a good day.  A really good day. And even though Grandpa doesn't know, I am actually taking a really big chance by outwarding stating that in this blog, because I know that he used to check it.  But if I can't be honest to myself here why bother?  I try to live my life as an open book, and this is the perfect format for such a thing.  on another note, I have been reading this book called "Salam Pax, the clandestine diary of an ordinary Iraqi" which is excerpts from a blog done my an Iraqi man just before and during the Iraq war.  I find that not only do I totally respect him, but I get the impression that I could get along with him (his music likes are similar to mine and the Libster's for that matter) A lot of people who are familiar with the blogging world already know about him, and as I discover every day that is quite a complex world.  Anyway, when I get the linky linkyish things to work on this frigging page I will have his site on there, for the moment though here is his web page www.dear_raed.blogspot.com   It is just cool, he has great links,an acerbic wit (I learned that word today-had to use it), and a wonderful and insightful writing style.  And no I am not getting paid to type this, but I think that I stumbled upon somthing so incredibly unique and special that I want other people to witness it too.  So go and check.  It's nifty neat-o.   and the last item for today's mini novel about my boring life.  My turtles miss me.  When I let them run around last week I stayed mostly in my bedroom watching TV (I am trying to break myself of that habit---I didn't come home everyday and watch TV all evening when I was in school and I am not going to start now) but the entire time they were in the room with me, hanging out by my bed.  They would sleep directly under me and then when I was awake come out and make the occasional noise so that I would notice and talk to them.  Scooter would watch me until I noticed her and spoke to her and then go play on my shoes.  It was soo cute.  and I am not a crazy turtle lady, but it dawned on me that they follow me around the house when they are out of their tank.  When I am in the main room they stay in there, when I am in the bedroom they go in there.  In the mornings, Scooter would station herself in the mini-hallway between the front room and my bedroom (a situation where on a couple of occasions I almost stepped on her) and Zip would hang out in the bathroom in the morning.  I guess that many people don't think of reptiles as being the type to emotionally attach to someone.  But my family has been the safest and most stable home (we have had them for over 8 years now) that these little guys have had, and I guess that is a sign that they are happy.  Their tank is on the computer desk and the lamptop screen blocks a third of their view, but I just moved it back to look at them and they are both asleep nestled in the turtle bedding on the side close-est to me.  Zip is completely relaxed with her arms and legs splayed everywhere and Scoot is using her arm as a pillow.  Man, I wish that they would take a decent picture because I love these moments when they are like this.

      oh no I am not done yet.  This is the best quote ever.  This is from the Salt Lake Tribune:   "A 40-year-old man committed suicide Saturday by jumping from a balcony on the 19th floor of Salt Lake City's Grand America Hotel, police said.      "He was just despondent over something," said Salt Lake police Lt. John Cardona."  Duh.  Nothing much going on in today's news.... I love Arab News, it is extra cool, but not as cool as reading Turkish newspapers.  On Friday "I" had asked me if I had heard of Milliyet and was wondering if they had an emglish site.  I found it for him, but the Turkish version is definitely more complete, I asked if he wanted me to watch if for the next few days, but he said that he wasn't sure yet---he will probably tell me when he gets back from Geneva---with chocolate--like always :)

      Yesterday, I went and used the office copy machine for an hour and a half, got everything copied that I wanted.  Then I had to go to Perseopolis and pick up a menu for catering possibilites. And I went to this Middle Eastern Grocery store just to check it out, someone had come by work the other day with advertisements for 59 cent pita bread. And yes, it's true.  After that I went to the library to see if they had any interesting movies, while there I ran into Ryan and Stephanie who I hadn't seen since my birthday, but I had talked to a couple times on the phone and the very occasional email.  So I hung out with Stephanie (watched Pricsella Queen of the Desert-forgot how cool that movie was-2 episodes of law and order) then we went over to one of her friends house that had just moved. Apparently I meet a lot of people that I forget, but they don't forget me.  I didn't use to do all of this stuff.  So I find out last night that the company that does all of the ink for our printers at work is the same company that Ryan works for, and the printer guy who talked to me the other day (which I thought was highly unusual) was his brother who remembered me from the wedding.  Why didn't he say anything!!!??? ANd also in the how-small-the-world-really-is deal, the September who is part of the dance toupe who I taught how to do Kurdish dances to today was in fact the same September who used to date Edgar (Ryan's friend, who is awful cute, but definitely has issues).  The Kurdish dance instruction went really well. They liked it, and I am going to go back on the 11th to work with them again.  2 hours of dancing.  What fun.  I don't think that they expected it to be as strenous as it was, but I never have thought as the wedding dances as being an aerobic workout.  One thing though, just before I went I watched a bit of the tape from the last Newroz I attended that night.  It is amazing how the memories of frustation, inadequacy, and just general hurt from that night can come out.  I am such a stupid girl. Oh, and I also noticed how wide I am compared to other people.  not the shoulders and head perhaps but the center sections.  So the rest of today.... I watched the Count of Monte Cristo (twice) which I had checked out from the library (it was good, alright) and I started re-reading it.  Not that I ever got past the first 100 pages the first time, but now I really want to see what I am missing.  I do this with everything, I start soo much and then I get distracted by something else.  No wonder it took me so long to graduate college.  and now I really have no clue what to do.  I know, boo hoo. But dangit this is my damn blog and I can whine if I want to.  I gave the babies a bath again today and cleaned out their tank.  I think that I let them wonder around for too long, because they pooped on the carpet again.  But at least I don't think that they are mad at me anymore, they discreetly crapped in the corner, so that I wouldn't step on it, or find it....hummm....are my turtles that cunning?  That would be cool if they were...

      So day 15 of the unoffical JB leave Countdown went well.  She kept complaining all day about how here arm hurt when she used it.  The answer to her problem would NOT USING THE ARM!  I was just not symphatic towards her at all and I think that she sensed it.  Kani wrote back to my Mom, he called her "spirited" hee hee, she is but it just sounds a bit funny coming from him.  He also worte about how I was a "true daughter of Kurdistan" and that he wished that there were 100 more of me so that one of them could be the next Joan of Arc or (Joan of Arch as he put in the email) call me crazy, she became a saint and all, but she did lose the war and was burned at stake by the English.  I don't know if I am ready for that sacrifice.  Also, I think that their are plenty of Kurdish marytrs to go around.  I would reather be remember for action, not smoke.  But Kani still hasn't written to me.  Damnit! He said that he would.  And I am so curious as to his reaction to my email that it is killing me.  Why build me up to my mom? Trust me, she's bias and already knows how great I am.  Is he afraid too? Or is it just going to be the huge novel about how I am a total bitch, I would be cool with that, it just has to come that's all. Driving down to my parents I had this thought, that Kani is the sterotypical melodramatic Kurdish male.  He reminds me of that character in the film Marooned in Iraq who gets everything stolen from him.  He is hanging out on a snow capped mountain in his undershirt.  His friends go by, he tells them his story, they offer him a coat and he turns them down because someone is coming with a mule for him.  Then they leave and he continues to wail and rips his shirt off making the whole situation worse.  I think that the whole Kurdish question can be wrapped up in that scene.  They get offered a coat when they need it but turn in down because they are waiting for the mule.  So today I have been hanging with the little Bro.  Hi Jimmy.  He won't read my blog because it has too much writing on it and not enough pictures. What a goof, I love him, but he is a goof.

      bit of gossip, apparently when Ann left last Friday (her last day) at the Bookstore, she left Paul's birthday card, which apparently was signed, but never given to him, torn in a hundred little pieces on his desk.  Yeah, he was mad.  Went to Earl the store director, who was equally as mad.  They wrote a letter to be added to her file at Human Resources and to her new bosses at the Registar's Office.  I hope that she doesn't find out about it, that would be awful to know.  But then again, I am kind of disappointed in her childish behavior.  When Paul told me I was in such shock that I couldn't think of anyway of defending her.

      Yesterday was a wonderful day, I was relaxed and spent most of the day playing with photoshop and splicing Madonna's head into a Kabbalah diagram for Lenowitz's class flyer.  But today, I walked in, smelt JB's perfume and all of this anxiety and tension went into my shoulders.  It was her first day back from her surgury.  she was only here until 3, but that was enough.  I am in the office not even 2 minutes when she starts telling me about plans to move more filing cabinets around.  God, just leave them where they are.  Who fucking cares!  We also did the welcome back card and cheesecake mini-party for her.  I came up with the idea, and arranged it so that everyone could be there, but I just couldn't face niceness.  I was made to feel obligated to do something for her and it still pisses me off.  While we were eating, June was telling this story about a cuckoo clock, and "I" didn't know what that was.  It isn't something that they have in Egypt you know. But JB's daughter was there (she is in college) and completely rolled her eyes and gave her mom this "he is for real look?" and she nodded back smuggly.  Here is the thing, beside being incredibly rude, "I" SAW THE WHOLE EXCHANGE!!  I know that he did, because he looked at me right afterwards.  I mean come on!!  Rudeness obviously runs in the family, but at least "I" and I wouldn't invite our bosses to our house when it looked like hers did.  Who is better than who here?  And yes, I am going to make an incredibly egotistical remark here:  I am better than that!  Other things that she did today weren't too bad, in fact I had expected worse.  She had me read an email outloud to her, I thought it was her arm that was hurt not her eyes, but all right.  and then she insisted on typing some labels for more files, I am not sure why she didn't have me do them, that is her normal trick.  But she started doing the  well the next time you go and get folders in the back" whine.  I had already prepared myself for that and had them in my file cabinet.  So I put the labels on the folders for her.  Half of the names were typed wrong, I re-did a few of them, but it annoyed me because I knew that if I had done that crappy of a job she would have gotten mad at me for it and given me another one of her "in order to be a good secretary" speeches.  Fuck that.  And while I have had more important things to do today I haven't really gotten around to any of them because I would start something then she would call me in there.  So I haven't done anything at all today, but I think that I am going to make out a definite timeline for tomorrow.  well making the timeline isn't going to be that helpful, but it will take up some time today.  Also we are not really sure when Mandy is coming back.  JB said today that it was the 1st of August, June said that it was the 26th of this month.  I emailed Mandy to find out.  But if I base the date on the first of next month, take out the weekends, and the 30th (my birthday and I am taking it off) I would only have to deal with JB for 15 more days (not counting today)---the offical countdown will begin tomorrow.  "I" left for a conference in Paris today.  It was so fun when he was here and not JB, yesterday he left his office open and played Arabic pop music really loud, and he sang along, lots of fun.  Had the dentist fill in the root canal yesterday.  A good tech makes all the difference.  When she put the dental dam on she total ripped up my gums, which throbbed all during the procedure.  In fact today my tooth doesn't hurt but the gums sure do.

      If I have to pee one more time today I will scream!   So I finally managed to talk to Libby today, I probably won't see her for a while now that she is assistant stage manageing for Colin, but I visited her earlier today and had a break with her.  I told her about Kani, but I just couldn't explain it so that she could understand how I feel.  Damn I am pathetic in that annoying I-think-that-I-have-drama-in-my-life drama queen kinda way.  And no he hasn't written and I think that I am holding out little hope that he will.  Bastard.  It is funny how many calls that I get in a single day from the press.  I really wish that one, this marine thing had never happened, and two that his family wasn't living in Salt Lake.  I am sure that some think that calling the Middle East Center is a novel idea but it really isn't.  So far I have talked to Carol Mikita from channel 5 and Brent Hundsaker from channel 4, wanting to interview "I".  I just keep passing them on.  Do you think that they realize that they have to get through the bouncer first before "I" even hears that they have called.  Sometime I wish that I had one of those number neon light thingys that resturants have so the servers know which table are up.  I think that it might be helpful, that way I could ring into "I" on a scale to see if he wants to comment or not. NPR or any Arab News source would be a 1, PBS, New York Times, Washington post would be about a 2, local TV stations woould be around 5, local newspapers 4, and local radio might be just barely a 2.  But you never know, sometimes he is open to absolutely everything press-wise.  Von Sivers is going to be on the 6:30 news on channel 5, and maybe later at 10 on channel 4 so maybe I will watch a bit of the news today.  I have a half hour left of work, and not that I exactly have anything pressing to do this evening except bathe the turtles, but I just wanna go home.  I have done a lot today, but I feel totally worthless. When the phone rings I just stare at it.  Or like I just did, stare at the computer screen and wonder why whatever I am thinking is not automatically popping up onto the screen. blah blah blah  There was something else that I wanted to say but I can't quite remember.  Humm...maybe I will go and write a email to my mom before I go.

      I still feel a bit empty today.  No word yet from Kani, I assume that no word from him is a confirmation of the fact that he doesn't care, and probably never did.  I guess that I can add him to the list of people who I have let walk all over me in this life.  I re-read his piece today, just to see if I was out of line with my inital comments on the article, and I wasn't, it is just as offensive today as it was the other day.  Part of me wants to take back what I said, because I was so mean, and I hate when I am mean. (and for regular readers I know that will sound odd in light of my bashing of JB on here) but thinking mean thoughts about someone is bad enough, acting on them is the worst, and telling someone exactly what you think of them, knowing that it will hurt them is also pretty high on the list.  I am sorry if I hurt him, and I know that my email will probably be put in the hate-mail binder he has, but I am not sorry that I told him.  Sometimes in the name of friendship you need to tell that person the worst, and hopefully if the friendship is true enough it will withstand it and become stronger.  And granted, it has only been 2 says since I sent the email, 2 days is not a long time in the life of someone who is as "busy" as Kani says that he is.  But if I was expected to drop everything to edit his stupid article on a holiday weekend, then I feel that I should be able to get a response from him.  If I had said nothing, I at least would have gotten a thank you email from him.  My mom seems a bit worried, because she knows that my feelings are hurt in all of this, and they are, but it isn't something that she needs to worry about, it wouldn't be the first time that I let myself become emotionally attached to someone (and them having absolutely no clue in the world) and getting my hopes and ego crushed.  It is all part of the learning process.  Some people boldly go out, make mistakes, and get squashed in a very open way, I have always been very very subtle about it.  It is very quiet at work today.  Beth comes in late on Tuesdays at 9:30 and "I" called to say that he will be here sometime before his 12:30 lunch appointment, so I guess that I will be pretty much by myself most of today anyway.  I have stuff to do, I just don't want to start any of it.  But I should go Sluglett said that he will be coming in today and I really don't want to get caught goofing off by him, his britishness seems to make me feel a little more guilty than I know I should be. Till later

      NO blogging for a couple days, but I think that my extremely small readership will probably not notice.  Forget what happened at work, because it has lost all relevance.  What has occupied all of my thought has been Kani, henceforth referred to as a bastard.  You might remember me mentioning that he had asked me to edit a speech of his, which was just awful, and I was hoping that with my comments that he would completely rewrite it.  No such luck, in fact yesterday he sent me another version (almost exact to the first one) and announced that he had wanted to send it out for the Fourth of July.  This open letter that he has addressing to Minister Nesreem Berwari of the new Iraqi government was awful.  And even though I wrote 3 pages of edited comments and begged him not to send it out the bastard did anyway.  If you want to read it, the address it www.kurdistan.org/Current-Updates/berwari070404.html  I hope that it makes you as sick as it made me.  My mom was even outraged by the letter and sent him an email....  this is what she said: Kani,   I have been a long admirer of you and the work that you have been doing with your American Kurdish Information Network. You have opened my eyes to issues that I had never before even considered. I enjoy most of your writings.  However, the piece that you are about to send out on the 4th of July, is NOT one of them!  Debbie had shown me the first draft and also the second, and asked my reaction. I could not in all good conscious stand by and see you degrade your self, your cause and Kurds in general with  "An Open Letter to Nesreen M. S. Berwari".     First of all, you sound like a love sick puppy, disappointed because Nesreen Berwari did not fit your vision of a perfect "Kurdish" woman.  Heaven forbid that an aide would walk her out to her seat, be gentleman enough to carry her presentation and help her into her seat. She is a woman, hence female.  She is from Iraq, hence an Iraqi.  She is Kurdish by heritage, but forgive me, as much as one would like there to be a country that Kurds could call there own, there is NO Kurdistan the country.  I fail to see the problem with her not considering herself a Kurd first before anything else.  From what little I know of her, she has done much to help women and children, both those who are Arab and Kurdish as well.  She is a political figure, who is walking a tight line in this changing current political climate.  She is well educated and well thought of.  She is making a difference in peoples lives. While you may have been disappointed in the way that she entered the room at the International Conference at the American University on Iraq, the problem is yours, not hers.       You also make other references in your  writing which are troublesome.  You consider yourself a "junkie of political news relative to the Kurds", how DEGRADING is that!  Yes you may know much about a lot of issues that most Kurds don't, but as The Director of the American Kurdish Information Network, you should!  By making such a comment, you degrade no only yourself, but all the issues and causes that you have worked on in the past and will to do in the future. You make a fool of anyone who has worked with you, supported you emotionally or financially. I hope that you are better than that! You make references to Kurds being "slaves", your sarcastic remarks about Minister Berwari's meeting with President Bush,  references to American History, "the milestones of human liberty" and Saddam Hussein.  While I don't agree with a lot of thing that President Bush does, he too walks that tight political rope.  Peoples of all nations and nationalities have been considered slaves, not just Kurds.  Read and think about American History in all it's glory and splendor and times better forgotten.  While we, as a nation, have done much good in certain areas, much bad has been done also. No one is perfect by any means.  Liberty has it's costs as well as it's milestones. And while not everyone is interested in American History and the history of the area they currently live in, don't put them down because they like to go "shopping".  Much can be learned about people by watching how and what they buy.  I find your comments about Saddam Hussein were not appropriate either.   One of the most disturbing references is when you talk about your sister as a "retard".  According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, retard means to "delay the progress in".  Your sister was not retarded because she could not tell time, she was never given the opportunity to learn!  A BIG DIFFERENCE!  Many women, no, most women in third world countries, are not given the opportunity of an education.  And by who?  Men!  Men are the only ones that need an education, the only ones with the authority and a voice to make a difference, right?  WRONG!!!  Who educates the children, men?  NO, women do!  Society, while trying to keep their traditions, must change it's backward and old world thinking and come into the twenty-first century if things will truly change.  If more women were given the opportunity of an education, I dare say that this world might be a better place for all to live in.  It would definitely have a different outlook on things.  While you have your issues with Nesreen Berwari, she is at least trying to make a difference.   Kani, sometimes people are so close to a subject that their vision gets cloudy and they have a hard time seeing the total picture.  I know you live and breathe your work. Maybe it's time to take a break.  Rethink how you could help more people on a larger scale.  Go back to school for your Masters. May be then, you would be able to look at things in a slightly different light and be able to help more Kurdish people achieve the liberty, freedom and hope for a new future that they are desperately trying to achieve.   Sincerely Yours,   But when I read the version that he sent out even after I had begged him not to, I am not sure that I can describe how I felt, like all of the help that I had given him meant nothing.  It was awful watching him ang himself with his own words.  I sent him an emai afterwards, I said a lot of mean things, but I felt that he had proven all of them to be true.  He made a mockery of all of his hard work.  This was the email that I sent to him after he sent out his "open letter' to the public...  How can you look in the mirror every morning?  Do you realize that by witnessing ONE SIMPLE act you have accused Minister Berwari of being like SADAAM HUSSEIN?  A man who oppressed, tortured, and murdered your Kurdish brothers and sisters in Southern Kurdistan for over 30 years?  Shame on you, Kani.  By allowing M. Berwari to have her assistant hold out her chair for her (gentlemen-like behavior) you have equated her to the murderer of 5000 hapless souls in Halapja.  Forget about honoring the memory of your fellow patriots as you like to call them, you have disgraced them by making such an extreme and erroneous comparison.     I know full well that the Kurds have gotten the shaft over the centuries.  They have been oppressed, misused, murdered and misunderstood.  The public cares nothing for them, this is where you step in.  I understood your life's work to be furthering the cause of your Kurdish brethren.  I have watched you for years work yourself to death in this most noble of causes.  But today, with your letter, you have destroyed everything that you have worked so hard for.  It makes me sick to my stomach and it breaks my heart.     I thought that with the release of Leyla Zana, that things for the Kurds were "looking up".  I guess that I was wrong.  Instead of capitalizing on that good fortune, and capitalizing on the increased Kurdish influence in the new Iraq, you criticized everyone who is trying to do a bit of good in such an extreme way that you have become heartless and cruel.  You have proven yourself to be a child unable to deal with his own frustrations in this world.     So tell me Kani, what good have you done for the Kurds lately?  Have you been coordinating with various Outreach groups across the country?  Or have you been waiting for them to come to you?  Have you been writing grants to that you can expand your programs?  Or grants so that you get help in that office?  You cannot keep running this one man show forever, especially now as you are obviously showing signs of major burnout.  That helps no one.     And while I am on the subject of money, let me digress a bit to your treatment of women.  Let's forgo the comments that I have already made in defense of Minister Berwari.  How about your sister?  Yes, she is not retarded (an odious word) and she is a victim to the system that she was brought up in.  Yet she and her peers are bringing up the next generation of Kurdistan, if nothing is done for them now, what hope is there for the future?  Have you already forgotten the lessons that Leyla Zana and M. Berwari have taught us about the power of education for women? Try to do something for your sisters, do something not just complain.  You came to America because you saw the opportunity to affect change, so do it.  Women, that is where the "big bucks" are, that is where you can get the general public and their pocketbooks involved.     I have always been willing to help you, all you have ever needed to do was ask.  And I am sure, given a little time to calm down, that will always stay the case.  But I can no longer stand by, and adore you absolutely, when you need someone to buckle down and tell you when you have done something wrong.  This email has hurt, deeply, to me and maybe to you.  But your open letter was wrong in every sense.  Your logic has reduced you to the level of the very people you hate.  Right now, you are dead in the water, you need to change (and fast) or pack it all up. Yours,   I had bad dreams all night.  Kani was a tryant and threw me out of my own house in the rain.  When I began to dance outside in that rain, he came out, even more angry with me than before.  And I was banished from my own home.  I have felt hollow all day.  Last night I cried so much, I don't really feel like I am here.  My mom and I watched a movie called Ali Zaoua about Morrocan Street children, I cried more than I probably should have.  It was still a really good movie.  We tried to sent up the tent that we bought for the next time we go out to the rocket show it was pretty cool, but putting it up and taking it down was probably really funny to watch as everyone was griping at each other.  It wasn't bad too bad, normal for us, but dang Jimmy takes everything personally and has been pouting all day.  SO I must go and help my mom, we are getting ready to bar-b-q.

       Freaky, Blogger changed on me in the last 2 days.  I have been silent but things happened.  I talked to "I" about JB the other day and he just proved how awesome he is as a boss.  Nothing has changed, but I feel better knowing that I am not alone in some of my frusrations, and that I have someone to talk to about it.  Also we opened up a new line of communication so that if I do anything wrong, or he sees areas in which I can improve, he can talk to me without worrying that I will freak out or anything.  Not that I would, but I think that he has been scarred in the past.  Bought myself an early B-day gift, a digital camera.  It comes in next Wednesday and I am super excited.  Now I will put more pictures up on here, so that my site isn't "too boring" as Jimmy would say.  I was supposed to go to the rocket show this weekend but they cancelled it.  My Dad is a bit bummed, but next month is the national show and we are going to go and see that.  It will be on the salt flats. the fam is still coming down this weekend, we are going to go to the Aquarium so that Jimmy can get a crab fix, man, that boy is just nuts over hermit crabs.  If you are curious to see his "not boring because it has pictures website" look at www.freewebs.com/pandja/   I am going to mess with Blogger this weekend and get the link thingy to work.  I should probably go, I have done shit today, so I guess in my last hour I should at least feign some semblence of work. Later

      CRAZY ALERT!! Weird lady came in today and told us about how her identity had been taken by someone who she believes to live on 5th and F avenue.  Apparently this 30-something woman is stating that she is a doctor and is even dressing in the same clothes as this woman.  She also has this woman's CIA Id number and may be part of a "volitile" group known as "taste the difference" which is doing something awful in her name.  Hee hee, it was soo funny.  Her outfit was just outrageous!  But her impersonator apparently is wearing the same pleated thing. And also has her hair is dyed the same awful color. So if you see anyone attempting to impersonate Lisa Goldstein please call the local FBI office or the police, because remember she is THE REAL CIA AGENT.  Man, we should have asked for her ID.

      Mandy called today while I was out at lunch.  She needed to talk to "I" about her coming back, I am worried that she isn't.  And while I would completely understand if she wanted to be a stay-at-home mom, that would five JB just enough leeway to try to be the permanent AA, and I don't think that I could handle that.

      What an evil fun day today is.  I came in, said Hello to JB and haven't said one word really since.  She told me that her therapist got angry with her for using her arm to much, and that it was going to land her back in the hospital.  The entire time she was telling this story she was talking with her hands...hee hee.  Currently she is on the phone with the payroll people who since they just re-did the system won't put her on because she will be leaving at the end of the month.  It's really funny.  Her doctor also said that she shouldn't be driving and she was fishing for a ride from me, but I am not going to offer.  If she asks me, then I might consider it, but I will not offer.  On the way to work today I saw the coolest stencil, it was 2 skeleton's kissing.  I wish that I had a digital camera so that I could take a picture for you.  I am considering getting myself one and buying it at RCWilley with my account---maybe a birthday gift to myself? Hummm... like the idea. Oh gotta go, she's coming

      I messed with the template of the MAL page, yeah I messed that up.  But I think that I managed to fix it, so it isn't completely destroyed.  Now if I can just find the patience to figure out the link thing on this one I would be set. BUt I have done enough blog setting stuff for tonight.  I think that the closer I get to the end of JB's time at the office, the more impatient I become with her, well impatient is quite the word---I just want to kill her in am awful way, no not kill....I just want to help her in physical therapy...that would be nice... "Does that hurt...good, go with the pain, we must reteach your arm how to move...don't pull away...you have to deal with the pain first...." Damn that was a bit evil. Well the gift thing that ticked me off, continues to do so...good thing that I went to the store this weekend to get some stuff to wrap because she sure as hell didn't. Then when "I" came in for a couple of minutes I gave him the bags...he didn't seem to happy about it.  Just wait until she crashes his step-daughter's wedding.  She asked me if I was going, told her that I wasn't because I didn't know the bride..JB apparently thought that my reason was a bad reason not to go...I was supposed to go because it is my boss's daughter.  Call me crazy but I am under the belief that if my boss wanted me to go, he would have invited me.. oh well, sucks to be sane I guess.  Libby gave her notice at the bookstore today, so doesn't have another job yet but I think that if she stays there any longer she will go postal.  Tomorrow she is going to come over and we are going to go to a couple places so that I can apply for another job---because I really really want to go to San Fran in September.  Worked out with Ann, it has been a couple weeks, but it sure felt good to be back.

      Kani wrote back last night, he wasn't mad at me, which I guess it ok.  And his email was another one of those things where his meaning could be blurred.  I veil things in my emails to him, and this last one seemed like he was doing the same thing.  But let's keep the obvious option open shall we, I AM OVER ANAYLIZING EVERYTHING,yet again. There is a conference on Kurdish studies in September, in San Fran, that he will be speaking at, and while there are many other speakers that I want to see there also---I think that I am going to go.  If I do go, I am going to do it right.  I am going to stay in a nice hotel close to where the conference is, and I am going to make sure that I have funds enough with me to make sure that I enjoy myself.  I have done San Fran on a shoestring so many times, that I wonder what it would be like to live it up a little.  In order to do this I am going to have get a second job, but something in me tells me that I need to do this.  I feel like I am on a precipice, I must lean over the edge. Other not so pressing/profound things for today...watch Possession and Best in Show, like them both.  I like Possession better this time when I saw it, I was too close to the book last time and couldn't appreciate it for its real worth.  I finished the Count of Monte Cristo this morning, what a cool book. I am going to start the 3 musketeers tonight when I get back to Salt Lake, I might as well continue with the Alexander Dumas kick that I am on.  And last night we went to Spiderman 2, excellent---I love it when love prevails...I am a sucker for a good love story. Tomorrow it is back to Day 14 of the office purgatory countdown.  I bought gift bags for those stupid gifts JB just had to buy for the wedding that she made me beg for an invitation for.  God, I hate how she put me in that position.  I didn't want to get a gift, and I sure as hell didn't want to go that the wedding.  And although I passed the invite along to everyone in the office, you just know that JB will go.  I can picture it, she will walk in with her and her horde, and "I" will give a short paniked look to his wife "why the hell is she here?" and Melanie will just have to nod "I had to invite her, it wouldn't have been proper otherwise they had gotten a gift."  What a bitch JB is.

      I went to the Childern's Museum today with Libby and her cute little nephew James today.  I had the day off because the 24th is Pioneer Day here in Utah.  The day where Brigham Young first came into the Salt Lake Valley with the Mormon pioneers and for some god-awful reason said "This is the place" But hey, it is a paid state holiday so it can't be too bad.  I am going to post some of the pictures of today up on the site.

      Well I was in true form last night, I was animated and quite wity---without alcohol.  Although Paul hadn't seen me interact with people outside of work and he wasn't quite prepared for it.  But you know that you are funny when you have people at the other tables laugh and repeat your jokes.  Kani wrote back (I had sent him an email telling him about coming to San Fran for that conference) he remarked that I should bring someone along for that long drive, so I told him that if he wanted he could come with me.  I don't think that I can be more obvious than that, so hopefully he takes the bait.

Kani put out a  urlLink new article  today, quite good, much better than the  urlLink dribble  of last time.  Apparently he is still on his Euripedes quote kick, but I guess that is ok, I forwarded  urlLink  this   to him.  I think that it is right up his alley.  Well I haven't cracked today, only done work when it came up.  So I am going to re-check the stat counter and then work on my grad school application until Libby gets here.

      Day Two of the actively doing nothing at work campaign.  It seems to be going well, but I think that I am going to crack by this afternoon.  Roberta came in to see "I" today, we spoke a little Turkish and man, am I rusty! Or pasli, as the case may be.  Maybe one day i will blog entirely in Turkish.  I have been trying to track down any Turkish blogs, but have not had much success with the exception of this weird guy with a  urlLink Tarkan fetish .  But I will keep searching.  And trying to find any Kurdish blogs from Turkish Kurdistan, forget that noise.   urlLink Iraqi Kurds  have been active, and so has  urlLink Iranian Kurds ----hello Syria and Turkey why aren't you in on this.  I have let  urlLink Kani  know but nothing as of yet.  Tonight, me and the Libster are going to play pool with Paul, man, he better be buying or else.

      Absolutely nothing.  That is all that I have done today.  It's pretty cool.  I goofed off on the internet all day, applied for a couple of jobs, answered the phones when they rang, and everyone thought that I was busy all day.  JB asked me to do some filing for her and I did it right away,and she was worried that she was asking me to do too much and that if I was really busy that it was alright to tell her that I couldn't.  Silly silly woman, silly silly office.  Well I've gotta go---it is off to the dentist today.

      Someone once remarked to me that the bravest thing that I have ever done is go to a movie alone.  Which sometimes, you have to do because you can't find anyone who wants to go with you.  I went and saw the movie  urlLink  Control Room   last night, it was wonderful!!! And everyone should see it!  It is about how Al Jazeera covered the Iraq war and how they handled being objective and the struggles that any news stations goes through in their attempts at being fair and balanced.  You should definitely go.  In other news, they found the head of the guy that was  urlLink beheaded   in Saudi Arabia.  They had kept in a freezer, and they don't know where the rest of the body is.  It makes me sick, those militants call themselves Muslims, yet they can not even respect their victim's bodies once they are dead. Bastards that they are.

      No fumes today, ahumduallah! Mom was in town for a meeting yesterday and so Jimmy was at the office with me most of the day, I love him, but damn he is annoying. Mom gave money for food, so I had fast food with Jimmy and then after work we went out to eat again to IHOP, man I came home and all I wanted was an apple, but I was still nauseuos from the fumes at work and didn't eat it.  Since I was with my Mom I missed the workout group.  So I thought, what the hell, let's do an exercise tape.  I did Tae-bo, for the first time, it was fun and I was kind of proud that I almost made it through the whole tape.  I had to do a lot of walking because I couldn't do more than one set of kicks with my knees.  I am sore today but I feel good.  I am only going to put myself thru that hell once a week.  Hakan came back today and was really really mad at JB because his travel checks weren't all ready and those that were, were screwed up somehow.  It was really hard not to laugh as I watched her trying to cover her butt.  She really doesn't know what she is doing I think. Hakan stated his frustration with the bureacrucy at being "stuck between Bush and Debra" hee hee hee Roberta is back today as well.  I really missed her.  She spoke to me a little in Turkish but I just couldn't form any decent sentences today--I really have to work on my stuff or I am going to completely lose all that I have worked so hard for.  I told her about how I was kind of bored and that I had spent 3 days scanning in text for prof. Sluglett.  She said that I was really nice for doing that especially because it isn't part of my job.  And you know, it isn't.  A lot of the stuff that I do everyday really isn't part of my job.  I find it very difficult having a job that does not require you to think.  So I am going to make a list of things to do when I am bored, which unforuately means that all I am doing lately is stuff to do when I am bored. What lovely fun my life is. I am purposely going to do nothing at all until 5 today.  Just sit. I have some new pictures to put up, maybe I will get to that tonight.

       AAHHHH FUMES!!!! It is just awful in here at the moment!  They are doing some restoration work in the auditorium upstairs and some chemical that they are using is just attacking everyone.  It started around 1, but at the moment it is unbearable.  I called facilities and maintainence, and they forwarded me to the Environmental Hazards department (and trust me that is really not a department that you want to call during your work day) they aren't sure what exactly they used, but the stopped work in there until they can figure it out.  Their recommendation for people like me who work in an office with little or no ventilation...go out and get some fresh air.  Wow, thanks, I wish that I could have found out about that before I started to hallucinate.

      Hummm, and now blogger looks like it is back to normal. Anyway, the new camera came yesterday morning, and it is a lot of fun, but boy does it burn the batteries.  The fam is down for the weekend and we went to the aqaurium (which I believed to have been finished-but it is only a "preview" at the moment) and the plantarium (which is where we took the pictures from below).  It is very rare to get pictures of my mom, so you should feel extra extra special that you got to see her. My dad and I both agree that it is an excellent picture of her and we plan on using it in any way that we can.  I also got a photo printer, which is quite nice. However stupid salesman man really doesn't know his stuff.  He told me that there would be paper with it, and there wasn't.  Good thing that I bought extra.  And the type that I bought was for postcards, so we are going to send the extended fam the postcard/picture things.  Grandparents will just love it! Well I should go, Mom's up and the bathroom is free.  Jimmy wants to get more hermies today, but I think that Mom is just going to kill him if he brings up the subject anymore. Later

      I have been crossing horns with JB today.  She started whining about curriculum and I wasn't going to give in to her.  Then yesterday TA office scheduling went into my hands and well as keys because they go hand in hand.  Well yesterday she had no problem giving me all of the old keys but said that she didn't have anything else. So I called the key shop and they are sending me a print-out of everything. Today she tells me that she does have a key file with all of the information that I need in it, but she wouldn't give the damn thing to me because of "security". Bitch.  I finally managed to get her to hand the file, but I had to plead with her with "may I look at the file for a moment, I'll put everything into a database for you". What a wench! I had to bait her with doing extra work to make her look good. AHHHHH! And she is making her daugthers come and clean tomorrow and I know that she is going to try to move those stupid file cabinets...I am going to talk to her about it.  Mandy came in, very sympathic, which was nice.  And apparently she used to handle keys when she was in my position....so JB needs to just fucking back off!!! Her work load is too much anyway. God! She pisses me off!!!  Thank god I have tomorrow off.  So tomorrow, we are going to go to Huntington for a picnic.  The move I want to see will be showing in Price, so we are going to stay there and see it, and then to Sonic for dinner.  I just want a super low-key birthday.  And in further cool news..."I" has ok-ed it that I am the grad advisor for Model Arab League, and I can work on stuff for it during my work time--as long as it doesn't conflict with other duties.  YEAH!1! This also means that I get to go to DC. and because of this great news, I am not going to apply for JB or Beth's jobs when they open up, I am staying right here.  Yeah!

      All right, it is official.  Well I guess that it isn't totally official until "I" says it is, but since Mandy called me and told me I can say that it is Debbie official. But Mandy isn't coming back.  She was really worried that we were going to be upset with her but of course we aren't, we all understand that she wants to stay at home with her baby. This makes me sad.  But it is good to know what is going on. JB on the other hand is floating on air and already pancing around like the job is hers...over my dead body is all I can say.

      Could it really be?  Can I hope?  Apparently JB mentioned to Linda that Friday was her official last day and that she had a bunch of job interviews coming up.  Even though I know that Mandy hasn't officially told us when and if she is coming back yet, I wonder if JB is just going to be fed up with the situation and just go.  Oh, please, please, please..let that be the case.  If it is true than Friday is her last day, the day that I am taking off.  Can there be a better birthday present? I think not. Well...unless it was a million dollars.

      Watched/listened to the live coverage of the democratic convention.  The clintons kicked ass!  However, they are going to be a really really tough act to follow, I hope Kerry manages to give a good speech.  My favorite quote from the speech (refering to the republicans) "They need a divided America, but we don't."

      Paul on Thursday told me that in order to end the 4 year sex-absence that I should just hang out at Frat houses on Friday and Saturday nights around midnight-1am.  I don't think that Paul understands that getting a one-night stand is not my problem.  There are plently of those to be had.  Call me crazy but I would like to know the first and last name of the person I sleep with, instead of a hap-hazard post-it note left on the bed-side table explaining how they had a great time, but don't call.  Last monday I had dinner with Kelly and her "friend" Doug (they are both disabled and have the possibility of making a very very cute couple) I took a couple of pictures of them and sent them to Doug.  Apparently I made a really good impression on Doug because me asked me out.  This is not what I need. I told him no, but it really pissed me off.  So apparently to the Frat house list for places of possible lovin' I need to add group homes as well.  In another semi-related note...I am starting to panic about the San Fran conference thing.  Kani seemed to possibly take the bait, but he has already bought his tickets. Then again I could be diluting myself, yet again on his reactions/feelings  which is kind of making me a closet drama queen.  I don't plan on coming out with this or anything towards him---I know that he abhors overly dramatic women, but likes it when they are quick-witted---that can be a really fine line.  So back to the panic, besides the fact that this is a conference that I really want to go too (without him being there) I am partly worried that I will let my ego get trambled on yet again.  One day I might learn, but the probablity of that happening is not high. The other problem is that the second job thingy is not going too well, as I can't really seem to get one---September is getting really really close...ugh.  I am going to ask my Dad if I can borrow his credit card, but this is an option that I really don't like as I know that he would probably help me, but really can't afford it.  It makes me extra selfish in a way--even though I will pay him back, someday....soon.  In other news, one of my uncle's horses died.  My mom is talking to him on the phone right now.  He was really shaken up about it, he puts everything into them, all of his money but more importantly his soul.  If he didn't have others to care for he would have just shut down like he did when Bar died, which is the horse that he had when I was a little kid.

      A funny note about "security" something JB is always concerned with... If she doesn't want other people knowing about "our stuff" like interoffice politics or problems with confindental HR forms, why does she not only tell everyone in the office about it (because a lot of this stuff I am not supposed to know about, and Mandy never talked about it to other people) but tells everyone in her loudest voice possible in the main office where everyone out in the hall can hear her?  Do you see a problem.  "I" told me that he praised Mandy for her discreetness, her ability to hear out a problem and keep it secret.  He has already trusted me with one such confidence and I have kept it.  I am trying to hold his trust.  I don't feel the JB could do that, so far she hasn't proven herself to be like that.  In fact when something is public it is always a "security" thing with her, and when it should be private she makes it public.  Go figure. damn I am glad that I have my new wall.  I can't get over how much better it makes me feel.

      I know, I have been quiet.  Well, at least I don't feel nauseous around her anymore.  She is a bully, I watch her bully people all day, and I won't let it happen to me ever again.  Now with everything being moved around on Friday, a desk and 2 filing cabinets were stuffed into the Zucker Room, making it unusable again.  I came up with a plan to move everything around.  Now I started the project yesterday and Jimmy is going to help me with the last two filing cabinets.  The difference in my moving stuff in the office, is that I discussed it with everyone FIRST and didn't do anything until all agreed.  Hopefully by the end of today, the conference room will just be a conference room and nothing else.  The glass display table that has been living in the Zucker room will be housed in the conference room.  There is now a bank of filing cabinets in the break room, which also shield the rest of the world from seeing inside there.  I have a new filing cabinet, and the bookshelf has been moved in front of my desk.  I love it.  Yeah, I have to pop my head over it now to see into the copy room, but then again, people can no longer lean up on my computer--giving me at least another foot of personal space, and an added 2 square feet of magnetic note space so the rest of the world can't see my crap.  It's heaven, and I fricking did it!  I think that I was hoping to teach JB a lesson in office diplomacy, but no.  Probably not.  Now that I have gotten my way--and yes, I am that petty-- I have been a little nicer to her, so I guess that she just figures that I was moody and something at home must have been bothering me.  the wench.  The bookcase also gives me the added security of it being another barrier between us.  I think that is why I like it so much, it makes me feel less vulnerable.   Tonight my family and Kelly are spending the night--rocket show in the morning!  However one more person is going to make it feel that much more cramped, so Jimmy and I are going to sleep out on the lawn.  Hopefully the sprinklers don't get us.  But it will be nice to sleep outside again.  Libby is supposed to come with us on Saturday but I need to remember to call her and let her know how early my Dad wants to go out.  She might be sleeping with Jimmy and I tonight too.  Then on Sunday I am helping Libby move into Colin's Dad's house.  Colin moved out with friends, and so Libby is going to take over his room.  She's excited, it means living in Salt Lake instead of driving a hour everyday from Layton.  JB is at a meeting right now.  The office is so peaceful at the moment.  I love it.  "I" isn't coming in today.  He just got back from LA and isn't feeling well.  He got to stay at the same hotel that they filmed Pretty Woman in, the Regent Beverly Willshire.  Damn I want to be a professor so I can go to conferences at nice hotels and such.  Unfortately, ever since he has gone, I have had "walking in LA" in my head...oh please, make that song go away.

      I guess that I should apoligize somewhat for the harshness of my language yesterday, those who know me know that it is very unusual.  I also got calls from family making sure that I was ok, even Jimmy sent me a very cute comment as he knows JB. Thanks hon. When i talked with "I" yesterday I was able (surprisingly) to rationalize my anger and the overall significance of her moving the filing cabinets.  It is part of a trend, and not her trying to show her authority as AA as "I" mentioned.  She is still a temporary worker, who wants to keep this job.  It would be in her best interests to be friendly with the rest of the office staff and show herself to be a team player.  By blatently disregarding the opinions of her office mates, her PERMANENT office mates, she is showing that she has little regard for not only the well=being and management of this office, but also that she has very little regard for any authority.  Linda said to "not get mad, but get even" and by talking with "I" over all of this, it is being noted on her record and these incidents are being taken as strikes against her.  After talking with my mom last night I have come to the conclusion that any respect that I had for her on any level is gone.  I can't even respect her on a maternal level.  On Thursday I wrote a note for Nayereh to look at, I left it in an envelope on my desk and I asked JB to remind her to look at it when she came in.  When I came in yesterday, not only was "I"'s schedule lying open on my desk (as JB had added an appointment in it on Friday) and his appointment book should never be left open like that.  yes it is on my desk, but it is never available to the public like that.  But also on top of the schedule book was Nayereh's letter.  The envelope was where I left it, but the letter had obviously been read. Not only did she read something not even intended for her, but she was stupid enough to leave the letter on my desk, in the open, and not put in back in the original envelope.  And no, this isn't a case were I forgot to put the letter in the envelope because I made sure on Thursday that my desk was clear and that everything was locked up.  How can I respect someone like that?  She came in late yesterday as she had appointments.  Payroll was due by noon, and she was planning on being back by 1.  So I had to call the AA in humanities to see if she would do our payroll.  she said that she wouldn't and she was sure that JB would be back in time to do it.  Well I had to call JB on her cell to remind her, and she ended up calling the AA in humanities to do it for her anyway.  And she couldn't figure out why Jane was upset with her over this.  She has shown herself to be incompentant to more than one department on campus.  There was no A/C in the building and it was hot and miserable all day, but I endured.  Around 4 "I" poked his head out of the office and I mentioned that a couple other departments in the building had closed because of the heat.  At this point he said that we could go home.  I didn't because I was meeting Libby after work, but JB was out the door in less than 10 minutes.  Wow, she almost put in a 4 hour day.  I also said that I was going to tell you about my birthday on Friday, and although the anger that JB has caused me the past few days has overridden any relaxation that the long weekend had brought, I had a really good birthday.  We went for a picnic in Huntington canyon, played some board games in the afternoon, saw the movie "The Village", and went to Sonic drive in because I had never been there before.  I got money from both my parents and my little brother for my crown, a couple of things of cookies and a candle as funny little presents.  I also got a neon lamp in the shape of a martini glass from DJ and Danelle.  Danelle's 21st birthday was on Saturday and I haven't gotten her anything yet, and I have absolutely no ideas.  Any suggestions from the peanut gallery?

      I hate her, I hate her, I hate her!  I wish that she would just curl up and DIE!!! didn't I predict it?  JB moved the fucking filing cabinets!!!  I worried about all fucking weekend, and she fucking did it.  It ticked off not only me, but Beth and Linda.  Linda and I sat down with "I" and complain, and all of the shit that she pulls on a daily basis is being noted on her fucking record, so there you piece of shit! You are still a fucking temporary worker and they will never hire your lazy ass!!!!  So she makes this comment, "is there anything wrong?" after trying to get me to talk to her for a while with no luck.  And I tell her that I am annoyed that she moved the filing cabinets.  "Well there is more room."  "that is not the point, more than one person in this office you not too and you did it anyway"  I left it there, although I could have and probably should have said more, all she did was murmur "well there is more room"  Fuck that you fucking cow!!!!!!!!!  I actually had a wonderful weekend, that I would like to tell you about later, but at the moment my pissed-offedness at JB has completely wiped out any joy and/or relaxment that I had felt from this weekend.  The FUCKING CUNT!!!!! God, I hate her!!!!!

      A legitimate complaint about JB. So today the new Arabic instructor was supposed to come in, no surprise, we all knew. JB went to lunch, leaving me with her customary "if you need anything just call my cell".  The new Arabic teacher came in and I didn't know what JB needed from her.  So I called and asked.  She told me to have her wait for 15 minutes and she would be right in.  The new Arabic teacher was alright with that, I entertained her, got her classw schedule worked out, ordered books for her, got new contact information etc, etc.  25 minutes later, JB breezes in says Hi to her and goes into her office and starts shuffling papers, making copies, doing things that would look like she was getting stuff ready for her.  10 minutes later, she hasn't said anything or come out at all.  The arabic teacher is getting upset.  I go in and ask JB if she was ready and she loudly (thank goodness) announces that she forgot all about it and was just working on other stuff.  I mean come on, she said Hi to the woman, I called her, just like she wanted me to.  I give her the benefit of the doubt and she acted in a most embarassing manner.  The arabic teacher's sister was nice, she acknowledged that I was really effiencet and thanked me for all the help that I had been, but also commisserated with me over JB.  So not only does JB have a superiority complex, having to know what is going on and having her fingers in everything, but also shown that she can't even handle the little authority that is given to her.    And this little event completely knotted up my back.  Oh, and she and Claudia (the hebrew instructor) decided to start moving stuff into the CLEAN conference room.  Granted it was just a Hebrew Typewriter, but they just moved it in and left it.  They have no sense of balance!  I had to go in and clean the thing up and move some of the furniture around to make it look like it was part of the display, I managed it, but I sure wish that she would consult me first.  Thank god I am decorating, I have seen her house.  It is nasty.  Later tonight I am going to post the pictures from my dad's rocket convention from this weekend on the Salt Flats.  It was pretty cool.  It is very surreal out there on the salt flats, driving on it looks like you are coasting on snow and ice.
