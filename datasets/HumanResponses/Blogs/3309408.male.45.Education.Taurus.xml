						     45   years ago, I crawled from my mother's womb and embarked on a voyage through this lifetime.  As of May 17th, I will have survived 45 trips around the sun, with only slight skirmishes of fate.   (OK... I was sentenced to life with a shrew, but the sentence was commuted to seventeen years by a kind judge.)   Whenever anyone asks my age, I ask them which age they are referring to?  No I am no mystic who believes in "REINCARNATION" as in "Wow, look!  I'm a (be)wildebeest now!"   (Frankly, if I were to choose how to come back to this existence, it would be as a big ole neutered cat belonging to my Aunt Mary...  He has it made.  Ok.. so he is missing some equipment...   Rather, I believe that it is impossible to tell a human's age by one standard: Chronology.  I am the following ages:       Chronological:       45   (Trips Around the Sun)       Physiological:       55   (Metablolism and balding genes...)       Emotionally:          8   (I never grew past that age emotionally)       Mental age:          95   (I suffer from CRAFT:  Can't remember a F#%$ Thing)       Spiritually:        Timeless...  (In the words of the immortal Beach Boys, "I've been around....)   So this weekend, I intend to drown my tonsils (Which I still have, thank you very much) in a large quantity of Alcohol, Mow my wet lawn, and get my house ready for a visit from my Mom and Sister, who have NEVER visited my house in all the time I have been divorced... and very rarely visited when I lived with wife and kids...  Till the next time...

						   Ninth level of Inferno?  I really don't know why I wrote that, other than that bit about the Ex and all...  I can tell you that Liberal is actually what they had in mind when they created Mayberry RFD, only without the cool sherriff and loveable characters.  The town teems with colorful characters, but on a darker, seamier side.  Our law enforcement team holds grudges with each other, but seem to be, on the most part, forgiving of slight trespasses our kids may commit.    Half of the windows are boarded up on Main Street, begging for someone to buy the building and try to make a go of it...  again...  We have good old boys driving beat up trucks, four-wheelers and ten-speeds through the town.  The ladies are as apt to smash each other's faces than to actually speak civilly to one another.  You are snubbed if you live in West Liberal,  (inseperable to all except residents here from Liberal itself.)  and are thought a great snob if you live on "silver slipper avenue" Denton Street.  (once again, inseperable from the rest of Liberal.)   If you park your car in an unexpected place, speculation and rumor run rampant for two years.  This is all fairly negative stuff... I mean, seriously, I love living here, so where's all the good stuff?  Trees line the streets.  We have a Fall Festival that is so sweet and maudlin that it won't die, ever.  Kids write poetry here.   Sometimes, good poetry.   In the evenings, everyone is either on their porch or walking the tree-lined streets or riding bikes in family packs.  Farmers gather at Casey's and rib the manager about the outrageous gas prices.  If you park your car on the side of the road in an unexpected place, dozens of people appear and ask if you need help of some sort.  This is Liberal.  My home.  Not the 9th level of hell, nor the 9th circle of Heaven.  It's a good place.  Later I will talk about the great past of this place.

						   When Emerson said "All men live lives of quiet desperation,"  he probably was envisioning me.  I am approaching the age of 45 in less than a week, going through bankruptcy, and trying to convince a judge to reduce my child support.    I love my kids, understand, but would like to eat something besides mac and cheese once in a while.  I am totally addicted to coffee, which helps me get through the day at the high school where I try to pound Shakespeare into children who are already stuffed with video games, reality tv shows, Jerry Springer and the playboy channel.  My girlfriend, Christiana, sometimes gets annoyed with my clingy nature, but she is still the best thing to ever happen to me in this lifetime.  I will close now, for I wish to see what the page looks like.  Mike

						    OK, OK, so I haven't dropped in for a while... Jeez, Louise...   Since I last wrote in this, I have, in fact, flipped my odometer to forty-five, endured a visit from family, been humiliated by my Ex, proudly watched my son flip his tassle on his mortarboard hat, and planned a vacation with Christiana.   How's that for a stroll in the park?   I had a GREAT weekend with Christiana in the Ozarks, at Eureka Springs and Roaring River for my birthday.  I got this great Australian bush hat.  (Possibly the only thing that has to do with Bush that I will allow near me... CIA, ya listening?)  I have never felt so loved.  School let out and my mother and sister came by for Ian's graduation.  It was great to have them visit me in my "Bachelor" pad.  Anyway, at my son's graduation from Parochial School, each graduate had a church pew reserved for family.  The EX crowded the bench with her relatives, leaving my folks NO ROOM.  I retaliated by tearing the name Brown from the reserve sign that read RESERVED:  Cizerle-Brown Family. Childish, I know, but I am that way.  I take my victories where I can.    Meanwhile, on the ex-front, She-witch foolishly pressed on with her contempt suit, claiming I refused to pay 1/2 of the health costs of the children.  She must sign a deposition claiming what she did with the insurance money she claimed from my account.  It is delicious to think of her being caught in yet another lie.   What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to decieve...   I don't remember who said that, but it is apt.  Ian is preparing to go to Hawaii for a senior get-away before he is in classes at Pittsburg State University.    I am planning to take Christiana to see her German friends in Greensboro, NC.  Life could be better, but not without winning the powerball.                                       -M

						   In the beginning, there were two people... A man and a woman...  The man saw the woman and said... this is good....  The woman saw the man and said... I can help him.  Thus, on October 31, 1956, Merit Juan Brown joined Loretta Jane Igou in holy matrimony... and promptly left for the Navy...  'til death, or dissatisfaction, do us part...  From this union, four children came forth...    Denise Yvonne, a small bundle of high fusion dynomite.  Micheal Juan, yours truly... to get to know me, read my other blog, sunspot.blogspot.com  Sandra Diane, the lost child... forever falling down wells, being left behind, smacked by cars...  and Vickie Jo, the golden haired wonder child... spoiled brat and the beloved keeper of the family...
