      It's another monday blue, but I'm wearing pink. A slow start monday to clear the emails accumulated from Wednesday and catching up with colleagues and friends over YM.   I notice the posting has slowe down.. PEOPLE! LOG THE BLOG! Or maybe I'm just too free. Haha.   How did ur wkend go? I went to KL/Genting. It was pretty cold up at Genting and crowded too. It's my first time there. The trip up was pretty interesting as we took the wrong turn and end up driving the deserted 'scenic' route, away from the highway and toll. Of cos, played at the casino and won RM75 at the "Money Wheel" (the wheel of fortune kinda thing). If it wasn't time to go, I would have continue to try to win the RM200 I had won before that. Greed!! U can never beat the odds eh?

      I'm on a training attachment with Sybase for almost 5-6mths now and it ends coming Aug. The contract states that after this 12mths training, Sybase may want to keep me.  Sybase is also bonded to EDB in a way so they won't just take advantage of cheap labour. Of cos there's circumstances when the company retrench, re-structure, move out of Singapore, etc etc. In the last staff meeting, the folks up there mentioned that they are freezing headcount worldwide except China n India. They state an example that they do not have intention to keep the interns in US when they can get 2 snr engineers in China/India with that price. Hence I am not holding high hopes that they'll keep us all. (There's 9 of us). After serving this 12mths training, I'll have to serve 2 yrs bond (for EDB) in whatever job that I might land myself in.   It now sound like a sucky deal. Just for the sake of the name ("SYBASE") I sold my life for 3 yrs. Whether or not Sybase wants me, is both good and bad. Afterall, in whatever situation that you are in, it can be viewed as good or bad. It all depends on ur perspective.

      It's quarter to 5 and guess what. I'm hungry!! I had Mac for lunch, and I'm trying to control my diet. Although I'll be going to gym after work, looking at the goodies that I'll consume over CNY, going to gym ain't enough! :-S

      I hate Mondays.. but today is different cos it's a holiday week! Today can be Thurs, and Wed will be Sat where you go home for dinner with family! That's something to look forward to. I won't allow anyone to piss me off (which already happened). No one can spoil my holiday week!  So what's in the itinery for you this long weekend? My whole family (the Lims + 1 son-in-law + 1 boyfriend/future son in law + 2 grandkids = 10) are driving up to KL/Genting for the long weekend! Will I happen to catch anyone of you at the 2nd link? ;)

      BHG plus telur and sambal.. *drool*.. and Macik, satu mee siam packet. =D I know Science canteen revamped, the western food sucks.  I didn't know cita has bcome ITU, what does that stand for?  Updates updates? Gossips gossips?  So who's married? Who's having 2nd or 3rd child? Who's attached? Who's learning to walk/run/sit?  I recently knew an accquintance (a NUS SoC undergrad who went on a yr technoprenuer internship with Sybase, US and came to Sg branch to complete his work) and think that he has potential of being a golden tortise.. but, look wise.. eer.. ok lar but switch of the lights first. Haha. I'm mean. But people attach liao loh, and I too lazy to try to keep in contact or "detach" him.. so I'm still enjoying my singlehood.. next wk KL, then Bali, Penang, Tioman, Europe one day? =*o*=  How time flies, I've left Sydney for 1 year, and cita for 3 yrs and I'm turning 26! *gosh*

      What's happening? No more new entries?   Do you have a new year resolution? Have you thot of picking up a new sport? How do you plan to improve your lifestyle?   I was surfing few days ago, looking at what kind of courses, qualification I can do. By the end of that day, I selected BSc of Psychology and Dip. of Physiotherapy. After hearing my sis' opinion, I feel Physiotherapy will help me find my passion. As some might know, I'm really keen on Bio Science. *wink*  I contacted the incharge at NYP on the Dip of Physiotherapy. The min requirement is "A" and even thou I've a BSc, I am lack of Bio background. He informed me of an accelerated program at the Nursing dept which is suitable for "pple like me". It is very subsidised and I can receive allowance throughout the 2 yrs course. At the end of the course, I'll be 'employed' by a local hospital. (Bonded I believe).   Nursing was what I've been thinking but family members are against it. And i don't think I am up for the 12-hours shift either. Haha. However it has a lot of avenues that you can specialise in.   Physiotherapy really sound good to me. Even if I want to try NYP (for 3 yrs), I'll have wait until I finish my 2 yrs bond with EDB (i'll be 27-8). By the time I can practise physiotherapy, I'll be 30 - 31. If I choose this path, I'll want to go towards research and eventually PhD. OMG, then I can stop speculating if I'll ever get married. Hahhaa. This path will be putting my 7-8 yrs of Comp Sci to waste. All that money, time and sleepless nights put to waste.   Alternatively, I can go oversea again and pursue a Deg in Physiotherapy. And move on to Masters and PhD. But where to find sponsors? Where is my golden tortise??   So for the time being, I'm stucked with my contract. Maybe I'll take up a part time job to save up for further studies. Maybe I'll look at what part time Masters I can take, but that might be a waste of money if it's not put into use. Maybe I'll think about what business I can do and look for investors. *wink wink*  The paper chase is so tiring.

      after a strings of public holidays, we are left with a dry month - march with no holidays. can't wait for apr to arrive. haha.  so bali was alright. lotsa aussies. you can just tell that they are aussies, no matter how they dress.   took a sq flight in the early sat morning, it was a new air craft. very roomy and nice. its the same one they launch for the non-stop to LA flight but smaller.   had a nap at the hotel room until 4 when we start our shopping spree in bali. the shops close at 10.. how nice.. ^u^   we went diving the next day.. strong current.. and i crashed into a coral without looking. we were sort of flying in the sea so fast that we dont see much of the marine life. the corals are indeed very nice.. looks unspoilt.. but with more divers going down, crashing into them, graping them for fear of being washed away, it will be quite polluted/damaged in no time.  we went back to wash up, had a nap and move out on our second shopping spree. knowing that its our last nite in bali, and probably last trip, i spent over SG$300 in beach/surf wear. Its cheaper and there's more designs of billabong, rip curl, quiksilver, rusty, roxy, stussy, mooks, etc.  some locals are very persistent to do biz w u. some are really nice and friendly. however  most of the salegals i encounter w are unfriendly, lazy and they show u faces. but the guys are friendly and didn't mind making the many trips to the store room. overall, i find the locals in bali are nicer then in most places. (although they keep thinking we are japanese, indonesian.. only one got it right by speaking Mandarin to us.)  it's a short trip. not fantastic but a good break. i'm so broke that i'm sticking to my $2-lunch for as long as i can.

      My mum asked, "Why aren't you out? Don't you have friends? How will you find boyfriends if you don't have friends? Why don't you join the SDU like your sis?"  *REB* omg, the pressure is building starting from this year, from colleagues and family.   Next wkend is a long wkend - Good Friday!! What's your plan? Sleeping in?

      Yo yo, whassup!?  I'm bored.. on a Friday night.. *REB - roll eye balls* But if I'm out, I'll probably wish that I'm home. What is wrong with me?!??! Then again, I wouldn't complain if I'm out with enjoyable companies.   I was having a YM (yahoo messenger) chat with one of the managers at work. (Not my manager, but he's really friendly) He started asking if I go out drinking and stuff. I said not much and no kaki (friends). We agreed that we need people of the same interest to have 'fun'. I thought it's hard to find people who shares the same interest but he thinks that you'll meet them when you go to the right places. Now, where is that right place? Pub for fellow alcoholics? Cinema theatre for movie buffs? Opera house for theatrical enthusiasts? Maybe he's right but I'm not that friendly to go up and get to know strangers.   During one of the chit chat sessions with 2 of my cubicle-neighbours, they started saying, "Why don't you recommend friends to her?" "Why don't you join SDU and take part in their activities?" Is this a sign? Or is it just the bio-clock? Looking around my company, I'm probably the ONLY SINGLE girl. -_-|||  Alright, enough of blabbling on a bored Friday night.. *yawn*

      Quite surprised that Jennifer Hudson was in the bottom 3. I thought her last performance was so much better than her previous. Anyway, I wasn't surprised that Leah LaBelle got voted off :P Jasmine Trias reminds me of Donald's fav girl (Celeste Chong) *kekeke*...I wonder who will be the next to go and who will be the American Idol...what do u think??

      I always wonder, do you guys have any after work activity? I remembered from NUS days that it was hard to try to get you guys out after work. But after I left, some of them managed to go clubbing. (is it me? hahaha)  So what do you do after work? Home straight to baby sit?   For me, I tried to go exercise at Amore at least once a week. (It's not enough, I know) I used to play pool every other week but that has decrease recently. And on rare occassion, catch up with friends over dinner. Recently have been thinking of picking up something to enrich myself. I need to be more motivated to go for yoga and pilates. I need to find people to play pool to practise. And I am also looking at any art classes that I can take to pursue my interest. I was also thinking of picking up violin, but but but.. expensive leh. And it takes motivation and determination. I still haven't develop the same kind of interest in violin as in art.   But ultimately, I need to do my financials cos my contract is ending in a few months, and Sybase still can't decide if they have the budget to keep me. (Or maybe they are not telling.)  I'm thinking of going to the Arts Museum tomorrow, anyone wanna join me? Hahaha. It's free for admission on Fridays, 6-9pm.

      For those of you who haven't heard yet I've been offically made redundant since the end of Feb and I'm now a professional bum at home.    One and a half weeks of bumming so far and it's not as bad as I thought it would be since there seems to be a lot of things for me to catch up on like meeting up with old friends, cleaning up my workspace so that the fire department doesn't classify it as a fire hazard and upgrading my trusty old PC.  Well, if anyone is free these days, you know who you can call for lunch :D

      After a few weeks of incessant harrassment, Rachel finally relented and arranged a meet up for today. It was a simple lunch at the Seah Im Food Centre - the hawker next to the WTC bus interchange. The area is now better known as Harbourfront. Joanna and I arrived 15 minutes late because of some slight delay in my office. Remy and Rachel were waiting patiently at the bus interchange when we reached. After a brief exchange of casual handshakes, we proceeded to look for an empty table. Rachel being the resourceful one found one within 5 minutes. Its no mean feat considering the hawker was full of hungry patrons hunting for empty seats.  Without further ado, we consolidated our orders for lunch. Once again it was helpful Rachel who 'volunteered' to buy Nasi Ayam for Remy and myself. She returned with three interesting versions of Nasi Ayam, namely Black Pepper, Sambal and Rendang styles. Remy had the sambal while Rachel opted for the rendang. I chose the Black pepper one which was so-so in taste. Jo happily helped herself to a plate of spinach noodles which were green in colour. After food, we chit-chatted over teh terik. It was quite a relaxing moment catching up over a glass of hot tea on a rainy afternoon. Unfortunately our reunion was short-lived. We parted ways shortly after the rain stopped. I can't help but look forward to the next meet up session. :)

      1. Saw "Taking Lives" on Wed. So-so movie. Interesting story, expected plot, typical acting. It worth 2 stars out of 5 but Ethan Hawk earns them another one start. :"> He's damn cute in the show. Kiefer Sutherland (the lead actor in 24) was good, pity he wasn't given much to play.  2. Barney's World Tour is coming to Singapore.   3. Black Eye Pea is coming to Singapore!!!!!!!  4. Kill Bill vol2 opens today!! "They" want to do the vol.3 but Uma don't want to continue anymore. Good move Uma. Cos Vol3 I heard, is stupid and getting too draggy. :|

      Went to watch "Hell boy" and "Hidalgo" over the weekend. Both were interesting and entertaining. Althou there isn't many climax in the show, I wasn't thinking about the time and enjoyed the movie. Maybe it's just the protrayal of "macho man" that got me 'enjoying' the show. I'd say 3 stars out of 5, the kind can watch, can don't watch, or watch during wkday sort.  Next, Kill Bill 2, Taking Lives, Starsky and Hutch, 50 First Dates.

      Did anyone of you catch this show? If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out this website  urlLink Eye for a guy   I happened to watch the first 2 episodes and I must say it makes American reality shows look so much better. I've to admit I watch it out of curiosity. Curiosity to see how our very own reality show fair. Curiosity to check out our local FHM girl. Curiosity to see how thick skin the contestants can be.  So what's my verdict? The show is not really up to the mark and production seems cheap. In addition, it does seem a bit too contrived. So what's your opinion?

      I went to watch "Passion of the Christ" and it left me with a lot of emotions, questions, and thoughts. If you have watched it, could you please tell me what are your thots? If you don't intend to watch, could you please tell me why?   My opinion: Fantastic movie. Thru the movie, I empathised with Christ and understood the meanings. I could also understand why this movie is made. There are serveral so-so or bad reviews, but I feel that they did not see the reason for making this film. Or maybe I'm biased? After a discussion with my sis, we think people can either don't like the show, find it either meaningless and ridiculous, meaningful and worth-while, or interesting and provoking. The show made me want to find out more about Christ. It's not just for Christians or Catholics. It's also for non-believers if you keep your mind open. :)  After the show, me and friend were quite 'disturbed'. We end up discussing about Christ and religion for 1 hr over a cup of hot tea (for me)/coffee(for him). I believe we will be reflecting on ourselves for the next few days. For the record, he's a buddhist while I'm a christian and we believe that we worship the same God. There can only be one God.  I went home and continued my work. Long story short, Indian guy in US hogged on the test machines for serveral weeks, and request that I complete my test by this week so that he can do his next wk. I wrote back to say that I am left with the weekend which I'll try to do as much as possible, but no gaurantee, and we should share the limited resources. This guy has made quite a name in the company. He was first in S'pore office. He wasn't able to understand what was taught, and couldn't handle simple tasks. He left, and went to US. With his Director brother's as backing, he got in to my company again. Anyone mention his name, they smirk and say, "Oh, good luck!"  Just another part of life to deal with. :)

      I watched "The Gospel of John" on the computer yesterday. Once again, the destiny of Jesus Christ has touched me and I cried again. :~(   This movie narrated the chapter of John from the New Testament. It also explained the things that had been said and done, according to the Bible. It takes you through the final journey of Jesus; the miracles he performed, the teachings (which are really hard to understand), the final hour, the crucifixion, and his rising.   This movie takes on a different angle compare to "Passion of Christ". Same story, but "Passion" focused on the agony and tortures that Jesus had gone thru. It had a greater impact on mankind while "Gospel" gave a better explanation which I think will benefit only the believers. Although "Passion" followed closely to the Bible, it had the director's own additions that may be interpreted differently by different people. "Gospel" is almost the Bible brought to screen, except there's variations to what I've read. I guess the Bible had been reproduced so much that there's deviations or variations from the original. Who knows the original then?   A picture tells a thousand words. Watching the movie allows me to understand the Bible better and it certainly left a deeper impression in me. I'm a "graphic" person. I remember pictures better then words. ;)

      Aren't they georgeous? I mean, if the Greeks really look like Brad Pitt and Eric Bana in The Troy.. I'll be the horse they ride on. (So cheesy.. hahaha)  The Troy, a great movie with gorgeous men. I spoilt the enjoyment of the movie because I was too distracted by Brad Pitt and his beautiful body. Fantastic fight scenes and interesting story. Director did an excellent job in telling the story on screens. Sadly, I've nothing more to say about this movie other then Brad and Eric Bana (totally dig his body.. *drool*). Orlando? Well, he acted well, so much so that I don't want to remember him as Prince Paris. He shall remain as the swift Legolas.   I should watch the movie again, and this time, pay attention to the show. I still can't forget his naked body.. sigh..   And what is wrong with the movie theatres these days?! Cineleisure's sound system failed me! So disappointing. :(

      Van Helsing.. if he's really as cute as Hugh Jackman, I'll turn myself into a vampire to let him pierce through me. *wink wink* Haha..   Alright, back to the movie. The bad thing - I was bored at certain points of the movie. The story/plot is expected. Well, it can get kinda drama but then again, it should be expected out of such movie. I was looking for more climax but since it was expectable that the good won't die, I wasn't too excited when the good guys were in danger.   The good thing about it thou, is the graphics. Really cool and fun to watch. And of course, Hugh is nice to look at, Kate too of course. It's worth, 3/5 stars.  Friend went to Eng Wah Suntec and reported bad sound system. The sound can go mute at the exciting part. I went to GV Plaza and the sound system also sux. One side of the speakers go mute and back on minutes later. I guess Orchard Cineleisure is still the best, although it can be deafening. You can do what I did, plug in ear phones. Hahah.

      Gross. Just seen the finale of "Eye for a guy" and I'm so disgusted and disappointed. Ok, she choose Sivet (sounds like a name for cats) which I agrees with her choice. But she's now dating Mark? Fine, if love blossom, great! But she's letting Mark to go to Paris with her and Sivet when it's suppose to be Sivet's "prize" for winning the game?! That's outrageous. What does she expect Sivet to do when two of them will be pretty much stuck to each other? According to Sivet, they were not suppose to contact each other until they go on the Paris trip. But Mark jumped the gun and has now started seeing Rachel. Mark really turns me off. Can't she tell that he's so fake and dating her is just to prove that he's still the winner? Man! Good on Sivet for not wanting to pursue Rach anymore. No good man would after what she has done. Well, I hope Rach is also playing the field like Mark, or I hope I'm wrong about Mark. Either way, it's one irritating couple, from the way they speak.

      Romance comedy by Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore who last paired up in "The Wedding Singer". I enjoyed the wedding singer better thou. This one had lotsa slapsticks and corny jokes which fails to deliver the punch. Nevertheless, there's still lotsa laughter. (I was wondering why the two gals next to me were laughing so hard when I was frowning at the corny jokes. It wasn't even that funny!) Crazy gals aside, it's still a funny romantic girlie show. I was with a guy so didn't really feel much of a romance out of the movie. Haha.   Adam sang in the movie again, and it sorta sound the same as in the wedding singer. You'd pity Lucy (the gal who lost her short term memory) for having to begin each day with so many emotions. But you'd also envy her for having such a sweet guy willing to do so many things for her. That's from a gal's point of view of cos. ;)  Next: Van Helsing, Troy, Blood Brothers (chinese)

      Wanted to catch hellboy but when I finally got around to it on friday..dammit practically all the cinemas not showing anymore.  In the end had to watch Dawn of the Dead which actually seems to have a lot more stupid people in the show rather then dead people.  Oh well....

      What's happening? No one is blogging??  I caught Kill Bill last Wed and I liked it! It is not as good as Vol.1 but I still enjoy the martial arts, humour, dramatic effects and the story telling. I must say, Quentin Tarantino is really not that bad. (hahaa althou ugly).   The audiences disturb me. They laugh when it's not funny. Just because the movie present the show in a dramatic, oldies-chinese-martial-art-movie way? So what if the high priest can stand on sword? Qing-gong does exist! They just can't appreciate the way the director intend to shoot the movie. It kills my mood, when I'm enjoying the dramatic effects and martial arts. I guess they just can't associate that kind of "chi-na-wu-shu-pugilistic" mannerism with the american ang moh.  I can already tell Vol. 3 is going to suck.

      Stella Artois has organised  urlLink Starlight Movies 2004  at the Fort Canning from 17 Jun to 17 Jul. Spent $16 to lie under the stars and watch Finding Nemo and Whale Rider on Saturday.   We arrived at 7pm and got a reasonably good spot to spread out our mat. Crowd was alright, not as many irritating SPGs or college students like 2 yrs ago when I was there. I was expecting more people but it's better to have more space around the mat then have someone's feet next to your face. It was a breezy night and that's the best weather to have! Most of the families left after Finding Nemo. And we got to enjoy the next movie "WhaleRider" after the chatterboxes shuddup. (They had to be shh-ed to realise. *REB*)   urlLink Whale Rider  is a highly acclaimed New Zealander production about the Maori tradition. The movie started off with muffled sound system (and chatterboxes), so I couldn't figure out what they are talking about. As the movie progresses, the plot thicken and the climax build up (and the audiences were really quiet!). It is about a young maori girl trying to prove to her chief-grandad that she's the next successor. As it is never the tradition to pass on the title to a girl, the grandad got mad at her for trying to break the tradition and being disrespectful to the tradition. There's a very touching scene where I belive most of the female at the Fort were trying to fight back their tears - me too. (*sob sob*) I must say, the actors were really good! Esp the little girl. No wonder she won the best actress award.   It is a very enjoyable and good movie, with subtitles. NZ accent is a little over-whelming. It's worth 5/5!  If you are interested in going for the Starlight Movies, and it's your first time, here are something you should take note. 1. Fill in the qtnaire and grab the goody bag. There's a copy of "Stuff". In it (other then 'nice pix') there's a coupon that admits 2 to Starlight movies on wkdays (Tues-Thurs and Sun, Mon close).  2. They have food stalls.. limited unless nachos, cheezy dogs, ice creams, evian and stella artois are good enough for you. 3. Bring cushions or pillows if you can afford it. It'll relieve your hands to support your head when you lie down to watch the movie. 4. Great event to bring pets and kids.

      Just realised that postings are dwindling here besides Rachel's weekly movie reviews (thanks for that by the way).   So is everyone busy somewhere else?  Anyone spoken to Uncle Leong lately?   Well, on my part I've been settling into the new job and now trying to plan my exit strategy.  Seems a bit fast but somehow just can't seem to get used to this environment.    Oh yah.. got a new gmail account as well... 2 weeks ago I was busy clearing up my yahoo email and suddenly I get 100mb free from them and annuder 1gb from gmail.  Anyway if anyone wants one I still have a few invitations left.  Just let me know.

      Oh how much they have grown! It's about time to replace them. Hahaha. The kids look more like 15, 16 then 13 years old.   At some point of the movie, it was really fast pace, at some other points, the conversations are too draggy. If you haven't read the book, you might not beable to follow. Even if you had, you might need to refer to them again. If you are not a fan of fantasy or Harry Porter stories, you might not enjoy this movie.   I enjoyed the movie, it was fun and thrilling. However, it was more fun reading the book then watching it. Guess the script writers didn't do such a good job. In comparison, the first instalment is better. Especially the Quidditch match!   How many stars is it worth? 3/5 because I'm bias, I'm a fan of Harry Porter!!

      I read a critic about the movie "The Day after Tomorrow" that the scientific facts or hypothesis presented in the movie were incorrect or absurb. So I was a little influenced by that comment when I watched the movie yesterday night at GV Plaza.   Well, it is interesting to use the weather as the basic of the story. However, among the disaster movies such as Deep Impact, Armaggadon, The Core, this one has become so expected. There's always a dog involved, a divorced family (to protray the American culture?), a president, a bad guy who learned his mistakes, foolish people who dont heed advices, a young hero who save his love and they kiss and make out, an older expert sacrificing.. and so on. Plot is too predictable. Special effects are not bad, but not good enough. I'd wish they will focus more on the greatness of the disaster, and protray the fear and how scary they are. I didn't feel anything. There some climaxes but it didn't get me too excited. Really, if its a story about the weather, show more of the hurricanes, storms and tsunamis, how they form, why and how scary they can be. Instead, they could only manage computer simulation used by the meteorologist.   Either acting isn't too convincing or the director fail to deliver the emotions. This deserves 2/5 stars.

      Who are the judges for the Singapore Idol (SI)? I heard there's 4 of them. (y do we need 4?? can't decide who to invite?) Dick Lee (guessed it!), Douglas Olivero (cool! think he need stock up on his foundation liao.), Florence Lian (she's still around?! :O) and some Hype Record director-talent scout who discovered Jeanette Aw, Phyillis Quek and Michelle Saram. (does he know music? director so free one ah?)  Of the lot, Florence Lian looked questionable. Can a former DJ know much about being a singer? I wonder how will SI turn out. The host already turns me off but I'll be curious to find out who are the people competing and are they any good.   One thing for sure, I won't have the courage to audition when I know my own standard. Hahaha. :P

      Hot college girls!! Another funny show. Usually I'm not into college-sweetie-britneyspears-bubblegum movies.. but this one is rather fun to watch. Its not those emotional-lovey-dovey-high-sex-hormone show. I would think it's more realistic-bitchy-sexy-unscrupulous-scandalous show. Well, that's what it's about anyway. Girls bitching about each other, using underhand methods to sabotage, trying to be in the "in" group, etc. Hmm. that's what most college students are facing.   Story: A newbie to the school, who eventually joined the most popular girls of the school but for ulterior motive. That is, to get the boy she admires in class. So she went about to sabotage on the "Queen" of that group. Before she knows it, she has become one of them, and landed herself in more problems. But of cos, such movie always ends happily&nbsp;with a prom. ;) No need to guess, everyone bcomes good friends again. (Duh!) Hhaha  Well, I think this is about 2.5/5. Funny, but it's a teen movie! and teen movies cannot go beyond 2.5.

       Two girls striving hard to be cabaret (sort of) singers. They eventually got famous after witnessing a murder, and was on the run to LA. The twist is they got famous not as girls but as Drag Queens.     &nbsp;   Funny and entertaining. No chio bus or handsome boys (well, lotsa well build gays) but the actors were great.&nbsp; Really simple plot but I enjoyed how they try to hide the fact they are girls.     &nbsp;   It's worth 2.5-3/5 for the laughter.

      It is a documentary film that sort of shock the world at the Sundance Film Festival. It is about obesity problems in America and an experiment on the narator/creator was done to show how bad fast food are.  The experiment is carried out over 30 days, where the guy had to eat Mac meals.. 3 times a day. At the end of it, he got serious problems such as liver failure, depression, and bad sex life. (haha)  Very interesting, although some parts I almost wanted to sleep when the experts are talking away. But it shows you the seriousness of the problem and how big the fast food meals are at the States. At the end of the film, I don't feel like having fast food or coke at all. Hahah..   The idea is.. moderation...

      That movie with Jackie Chan? Wasn't keen on watching but Sis bought DVD frm JB. Surprised that it could keep me seated thru'out the show. It's a simple, known plot. Not much excitment since u already know the story. So the good thing about the show is its humour. The lead actor and actress were pretty great. Act well and were funny. And I also impress with how they merge/morph 'cartoon drawings' to real life scenes. I guess since the show has really lean plot, they had to get in famous people.. such as Samo Hong, Olwen Willson and his brother (who's so cuttteee!), Kathy Bates (as Queen Elizabeth), even Richard Brendson(boss of Virgin Co.) had a split second act in it.   I rate this 2.5/5 bcos of Jackie.. don't like him. 8-|

      Oh it was great!!! Some people thinks its better then the first, some thinks its not. I think they are both great! :) I totally dig spidey's great body.. awwww.. =P~  The plot for Spidey 2 is better, graphics is also more natural, and the special effects are awesome. (I hope I didn't over rate it.) The only thing is, there are so many screaming females! I can picture the comic book with a square of cartoon dedicated to a screaming lady on the street. There are like almost 4 or 5 of them in this movie. A few corny scenes but I just brush it off with "comics" effect. There's a particular scene when Mary Jane was being lowered down to safety and her dress with a super high slit was taped down so that the wind won't blow off her skirt to reveal too much. Pity. Hahha..  And I don't understand why the gal sitting next to me keep giggling at everything! When they kiss, when the mean guy said something, when spidey puts on the mask, this and that. Siao ah! It's not a comedy show you know, even thou it's a adaptation of a comic.. 8-| Gals..

      Caught a spanish movie ("El Otra Lado De La Cama") at Lido yesterday. Pretty well acclaimed in Spain or the Latin industry. The story is about 2 couples, ending up having affairs with each other's partner. Basically it's about relationships, trust and sex.   It's a rather fun and entertaining movie. Great acting, singing and dancing. Almost like a musical on screen. Wonder if they had refer to one of the Bollywood movies. Hhaa. Great scripts and editing too! Truely enjoyable. Oh, and great bodies. ;)  I was more preoccupied with the language. Half the time I'm recalling and remembering the spanish vocab then digesting the plot. Haha. So, I failed to gather any conclusion at the end of the show. Haha.  Anyhow, it's spidey 2 today!!

      I caught it weeks ago and forgot to blog on it.  It is a futurist story when robots are everywhere on the streets doing what some bangladesh indians, philippinos, indonesians, china chinese, thais are doing in S'pore. A new breed was developed to replace the older version. And then it happened. These new breeds started to rebel and started to take over the world, almost.  Fantastic graphics! The martial arts moves are so fluid and pretty natural on the robots. Very nice moves too. Interesting although somewhat predictable story, but has a great twist that keep you guessing. It's entertaining!  It's worth 4/5.

      Caught the highly acclaimed (or publicised) play at the Esplanade. Verdict: Over rated.  It addresses the issue of transsexuals in Singapore. A story of 2 men becoming women, a woman to a man and a man who injuired his manhood and having it fixed. They met at a sex change medical center somewhere in Indonesia (bintan?)  and became friends. One man->woman even started developing feelings for the man-with-fixed-dick. However, it did manage to put in the issues that transsexuals face in a society in S'pore. It may open up some eyes/opinions of some, but not much since homosexuality are more open now.  So that's the simple story. The Straits Times did a very good review about it. The story seems flaccid. Too long/many pauses between scenes. Lousy actors except for the men-turn-women. I liked the stage artwork but I also agreed with the critic that it doesn't quite show the distinction of different scenes.  What I liked about the play is the opening and closing dance/sing performance by 3 macho transverstites. They are really good, even on those 4-inches heels.

      Why does it hurt the most when you love the most? The deeper you love, the harder it hurt. Love and pain, they go hand in hand. Knowing that it will hurt, you still want to fall in love. If you know that it will leave a deep wound, would you still fall in love?   If you have not loved, have you been missing out? If you had a choice, would you fall in love again? Why do you fall in love? Why do you take the risk? Why would you cry when your love leave?   Maybe my heart is too fragile to take the risk. Maybe I'm a coward. Maybe I'm not adventurous. Knowing the pain, I shut my heart. Am I bluffing if I said I did not shut it? This is probably why I won't be surprise if I'll be single for life. I wonder if I'm too picky or I'm not daring. Either way, it doesn't matter. Love can be given away in many ways.   No matter how you love, you will cry. So love with all your heart. Dry your tears, mend your wounds, get on with life. This is the road you choose. Enjoy the roller coaster ride.   "I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave, cos your presences still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you 'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I've held your hands through all of these yrs. But you still have, all of me...." --  My Immortal , Evanescence

      Next Sunday is a Muslim festival - Hari Ray Haji. It's the time for the muslim believers to set on a pilgrimage to Mecca. It's also a public holiday in Singapore. I'll be leaving for Bali with my 2nd sis, Zon on Sat until Mon. Probably will dive on Sunday. I hope I can find good bargains there.  After this week, there won't be any public holidays until April - Good friday. And that's another long weekend. I wonder where I'll go. It'll definitely be to Malaysia (near and cheap).

      10 people in 2 cars, travelled up to Kuala Lumpur (KL) on Saturday morning. We checked in and walked to the KLCC (the twin tower in KL). Did some shopping. Didn't get anything since I don't need any and the prices are comparable to the ones in Singapore. Parents and some of us went to the 'red light district' to buy dinner while me and 2 other sis stayed behind to babysit the kids. It's suppose to be great hawker food there but it turns out to be quite expensive. It's quite yummy thou. My mum got scared by the rowdy environment. Apparently, 4 drug peddlers were trading near our flashy red car. My folks were not in the car but standing close by to keep watch. Just in case they dump some white powder under the car. I guess they just used our Singapore registered license car as a decoy. Or the red car is too flashy.   The 2nd day, we drove towards the Genting Highlands for some gambling. The trip up was winding but interesting cos we took a wrong turn and end up at the deserted scenic road instead of the expressway. After lunch, we split up. Some went to gamble, the young family with 2 kids went to the theme park, and my 2nd sis went to the Starbucks with her laptop to do her work and dozed. I tried my luck at the "Money Wheel" (wheel of fortune sorta thing) and won 75 ringgit. Actually I should have stopped when my winnings were 200RM but greed got the better of me. It was time to go and I collected my 75RM profit. Hehe.  We checked out of the service aptment on Sunday and drove towards Singapore. On the way, we dropped by Malacca to visit my bro-in-law's sister. Actually, he wanted to visit, we just tag along. We had a yummy lunch before setting off on a 4 hour ride home.   Still haven't had enough of gambling, parents, me and 3rd sis pull out our chair and started a game of mahjong. Dad wanted to recoup his loss at the casino but in the end, my 3rd sis was the lucky one to win $20 from the 3 of us. I'm sure we'll have another round one day. I can feel the gambling bug is still inside us. Haha.  For some reason, it seems to be a tradition for most family to gamble during Chinese New Year. I guess it's when families come together, eat, drink and gamble to entertain themselves. And 'they' say its the luckiest to gamble during the Chinese New Year.   I'll upload the photos as soon as I've got the time to do so. Hehe. =P

      Finally, I bought 2 jerseys from Topshop at a discount hoping that will start the shopping-ball rolling with more good-buys. No such luck thou. Sis came home from her US biz trip and I bought a Victoria's Secret top from her. It's funky enough to be my CNY clothes.   The old home computer is not working again. (sigh) I hope it'll be fix after playing around with the CMOS setup: its not booting from the HDD. I can't wait to retire it. It has been almost 5 years and had gone through a few replacements and upgrade. It's time is coming...  With CNY (Chinese New Yr) round the corner, weekends were spent cleaning, frying, making snacks and tibits. I am so looking forward to Wed where I'll have reunion dinner with family, doing the usual ritual of drinking and stuffing ourselves with the steamboat dinner. Followed by manicure and pedicure in our pjs and receiving "ang pao" (red packet) from my lovely parents. $_$ I've missed this ritual for 2 years. This year, the whole family is driving to Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur and the nearby Mountain resort - Genting Hillands (for casino) during the coming long wkend. Hope it'll be fun.  I've just decided! My CNY resolution is to get rid my extra fats before the next CNY! Muahhaa!! (^o^)

      2nd attempt of this posting. Maybe a shorter one will go through. I shall now copy and paste onto notepad before publishing.  One more week to CNY and I realise I need at least one decent attire. Went shopping at Suntec/Marina/Raffles City on Monday, Bugis on Tues, FarEast Plaza/Isetan on Wed and I suspect that the shops are clearing their last season's stocks. It's horrifying. I'm trying again today. It'll be Paragon/Ck Tang/Taka, and whatever that's still open and my legs can bring me to. I also conclude that I need to shed those extra fats or I can forget about fitting into dresses.   10 days after I wrote down 7 new year's resolution I'm finding it hard to keep a few. Haha.. what to do? Chocolate is my life, my weakness, my endorphine, my aphrodisiac (not that I need any.. haha..). Nevertheless, I still have 349 days to admit defeat! Until then, never give up!!

      I went to see "Something Gotta Give" last night with my sisters. It stars Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. A very enjoyable movie with witty dialogues, a mature/adult comedy show that I believe you'll enjoy it. ;) [And Keanu was gorgeous!!]  There's a scene when Diane was telling her daughter the pain of falling in love. And her daugther said, "That's what I've been telling you, to protect yourself." (not in actual words)   The mum said, sobbing "You mean you have been living that way?"   ...Fast Forward>>   The daughter said, "I never know how love feels." "You have to let someone in. Even though it hurts, I had the time of my life."  It was touching the way the scene was played. Not to mention the words were what I have said and been told.   I have said to many friends who have got heart broken that one should always protect one's heart. My sister told me that I have to open up, let someone in, experience love even thou it might hurt. The sweetness will linger, anger will eventually subside, the wound on the heart will heal, the pain you'll remember. This is life. If you haven't experience falling in love, you haven't lived.   So Charbel was right in my previous entry. Knowing that chocolate will make me fat, will I still eat it?

      I had a good feeling when I arrive in Bali. The place looks like it has lotsa culture and sunshine. When we went to collect our luggage, a middle-age man took our luggage and showed us the way out. I thot, "hmm.. so nice of them." But when we were almost at the sliding door, he asked for tips. Disgusted by this behaviour, sis stopped him and insist to have our luggage back. We reluntantly gave him 5,000 rupiah (equiv. to S$2) and he gave me a displeased look. Maybe it's the way Singaporean are being brought up not to tip. However, we do give tips when necessary, esp when the service impress us.   We arrive at the hotel and were made to wait 1 hour for the room. Disappointed, so no tips for the porter. I believe they could have done better by showing us to a waiting suite they have. Esp when I told him that my sis is sick (and dozing off at the chair) they did nothing to make the wait more comfortable for us. Well, at least he apologised.   Nonetheless, the hotel is pretty alright. Nice environment, not too bad for a 4 star resort. Clean room thou the towels look yellow, but hey, there's enough towels for the head, face, body and feet.  We napped until 5 and set off to explore the shopping area - Kuta. We dropped by the beach on the way and the moment we step into the beach area (Kuta beach), we were 'welcomed' by the locals, selling us services like massage for S$4, braiding the hair, etc.   We went to a famous restuarant in Kuta - Warung Made. The food is yummy. No wonder there's a constant stream of people coming to the restaurant.  We shop until the shops close at 10pm and it started to rain heavily. We decided to catch a cab to go back to the hotel. After all, the 15min walk is not going to be very pleasant with limited street lights and muddy path.   We got up early the next day, had a small breakfast (what the hotel server was pathetic) before our diving operator came to pick us up. After about 30mins on the road, we arrive at the dive shop (that look like a house with courtyard). We filled in the forms, paid the money, arranged the gears and equipment and we are at the (Sanur) beach after a 5min ride. The boat ride was 30mins and we suit up and jumped into the calm water.   The coral formation was beautiful at Nusa Penida. Althou not vast or great, the colours were vibrant. Marine life isn't fantastic. We saw a couple of leather jacks, trigger fish, eels, nudibranch, pipe fish, garoupa, etc. We saw two huge titan trigger fish (at least 1/2m) at different time and our dive guide took out his knife incase this trigger fish decided to attack us. They are very protective of their environment and won't hesitate to nip off your finger or flesh if you come too close.  Towards the end of the first dive, the current started to pick up. We were being swept along. As I was facing to the side, I didn't notice that I was drifting towards a coral and I bang into it. That gave me some scratches on my right hand - the one that has no gloves. Lucky only my sis witness it or it'll be so embarressing.   The tides were moving up, you could see from the boat that the current were moving really fast even thou the surface is so calm. How can you tell? Just look at the fish in the sea, swimming so fast but not moving at all. Haha.  We went down to our 2nd dive after resting for an hour. This time was a drift diving. Just maintain your bouyancy and let the current carry you. Occasionally swim in the opposite direction of the current to slow down - which is quite tiring. The current is so fast that we can't observe much of the marine life. And most of the time I so worried that I'll lost my buddy and the dive guide that I'm not looking at the corals but at them. Haha. It was a good experience with the current even thou we didn't see much marine life.   We went back to the hotel to wash up before heading towards shopping again. Yesterday was more like checking out the prices and what they have. So this time, we made all the necessay (and not necessary) purchases. We were so tired even before the sun set but we held on to finish our intention - shopping!! We walked back to our hotel by 9 and relaxed at the italian restuarant at our hotel. Nice ambience and quite nice italian food. Finally, we went back to our room to pack our bags for tomorrow.   Bali is so packed with Aussies.. the wave's not as good as in Australia.. I don't know why they would make the trip to Bali to surf. It's so easy to tell that they are aussies. Even before your hear them speak.   Its a short trip, not fantastic but a good break. It'll prob be nice if we could stay a few days more in Bali to explore the mountains and other villages and learn about their art and culture. Having said that, I don't think I'll go back there again. Kinda boring for a city girl like me. ;P Haha.

      I have never been so sensitive with the turn of the month like now. I guess I can't wait for my 1 yr training to end. I've marked my calender with stars on 30 July .   To make time pass real fast, my life is packed with travel plans. Always looking forward to the NEXT trip when I'm on a trip. I'm always reminded of fun activities that's coming up. But I think I should make everyday as exciting, as worth while, as possible. Like "they" said, live life to the fullest. That seem to be the toughest thing to do on Earth.   I often draw out plans in my head when I'm day dreaming, stoning, staring blindly at the road infront. Plans like, taking art classes, go to more aerobics classes, fix the computer, call a friend out, etc.. I wish I could change my lazy bones. I wish I could seize the day. The mind is willing, the flesh is weak. What can be worst? I'm denying myself, I'm in my own illusion, I'm being complacent.. like everyone else.   I know what I need. Motivation!   I think I have to stop writting my thoughts down. They seem unpleasant, boring, draggy, naggy, pessimistic, to read. The next posting should be something happier. :) Haaha

      Recently, I seem to be emtional and pensive. That's probably what happen when you have too much time.  I took the bus home today after work. I had to take two buses to get home so you can imagine I'm usually dead beat when I reach home. My work place is 5mins drive away, but the bus ride and the wait will keep me for 30mins. I'm not complaining, I still think that we have a good public transport infrastructure here.   The bus was crowded with uni kids and working adults. Standing near the exit resulted me getting 'assulted' by big bags and files. I got scratched by some idiot who didn't know how to hug her file when it's crowded like that. And people with big bags should not be allowed on crowded buses! I'm not frail but it was really getting on my nerve. By the time I alighted at my stop, I was as grouchy as Oscar in Sesame Street.   I thought to myself. I need to go out, relax and chill. I scrolled through my mental list of possiple chill-mate but there was none I could call and get positive respond. Maybe I'm cynical, skeptical, or just isn't trying at all. I was thinking of a dear friend in a distant land and wish that I'm there, or he's here.  I stepped into my room, dropped my bag and keys on the floor, and slumped onto my bed without even changing out of my day clothes. Suddenly, I was 'at peace'... I was just lieing there, with the world cut off, thinking, stoning, staring and dozing off.   It was 10pm when I opened my eyes again. That turn out alright. No chill, no mates, no booze but it was alright. I made a mental note, to remember to remove the contact lenses the next time.

      I had been real busy last week. There was a tight schedule and I had to work from home over the weekend. Since last friday, I slept at 4am over the last weekend to try to accomplish as much work as possible. And being a lazy pig, I'm surprise that I could still wake up early in the morning (well, not that early.. say 9-10.. hehe) to do work again. Actually, the driving force was to finish the work and go out to have some fun. But in the end, I got stuck with work anyhow.   I did accomplish a lot last weekend and went to work on Monday to debug the problematic cases. It was draining, I realise. Looking at logs, scripts and codes, understanding how it work, and where it has gone wrong, I was so tired by Tuesday and I can't help dozing at work. Hahaha.   However, I was glad that I was busy. Firstly, it shows there's still work to do, I'm not redundant yet. Secondly, there's some personal issues that I was trying to figure out, or deal with at work and being busy gave me the excuse to be with myself.  This world can be quite tiring. Having to deal with work stress, family pressure, peer pressure, society pressure. I should think about what is my passion so that my stress and pressure are good ones.

      So excited was I as I read an email from my driving instructor friend in Sydney. He just received a new bundle of joy, it's a boy!! on Apr 15. I probably should send a card but I need to get his mailing address first.   Next week is another long weekend for me. It is Labour/May Day on 1 May. Although it is a Saturday and I do not have to work on Sat, I get 'compensated' for the lost holiday on the following Monday. Hence on Friday night, I'm taking a 10hr coach ride up to Penang, a state in the north of Malaysia. It's not a bustling city like the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur but it's known for lotsa yummy local food.   I'm pretty broke with the strings of short trips. First it was to Kuala Lumpur and Genting Highlands in Feburary. Next was Bali in Feb/Mar. Followed by Pulau Tioman in April and now, Penang in May. Wow, almost every mth one trip.   I hope next trip will be a diving trip. The monsoon has shifted to the west coast so the popular dive sites in the east are really busy now until end Sept/Oct.   I want to accumulate my wealth, and I want to enjoy life as well. So, maybe just one more trip for diving and that's it for the year. =D I hope I can squeeze in a trip to Sydney next year. My ideal plan would be to drop by Sydney for probably a weekend and move on to Perth or Melbourne. I think, if I can, I will drop by Sydney each time I go to Australia. There's just these people that I want to see so much in Sydney. Sound as if I have all the money I want to. Yeah right! Haha. That's why I said, ideal.. which rarely can be that perfect.   Guess all I need is either a rich husband/boyfriend, a well paid job, or an active, properous investment. ;)

      On Monday morning, I saw the red light indicator on the phone at work. I put down my bag and sat down to check who had left me a voice mail? And I've got 3! Must be some pranksters.   "Voice call at 4:10am 12 April... Hey Rachel! Guess where I am?!..."  It was Charbel transisting at Changi Airport. I'm always glad he calls as he never fails to put a smile on my face.   Charbs, if you are reading this, Thank you. I was really touched that you bothered to scribble down my number just so you can ring me from the airport. If you had called me on my mobile, I would have chatted with you until you board your next plane. Yes, even thou it's 4 in the morning. The thought of you on the same piece of land excites me. I wish I could go to the transist lounge to meet you. Unfortunately, I can't just buy any air ticket like you suggested to meet you in the airport. Haha. Absence make hearts grow fonder. That makes me realise, I really do miss you a lot.

      After 6 hours of ferry, we arrived at Pulau ('Island' in Malay) Tioman at West Malaysia. We were quite surprised that it took us 6 hours when it was only 4 hours when we took the bus and ferry afterwards. It was a rather tiring journey, contrary to what we thought. Lucky we popped the sea sick pills.   We can't do much after we checked in. Most of us were tired. However, time is precious, we immediately went for a game of golf after a 30mins 'power' nap. Usually you require "handicap" or "PC" (provisional cert or card, dont know. haha), but the resort allow non-handicap golfers if you pay RM$30. So I went for the experience. For the record, I've never been on the greens. Have been playing only at the driving range where you just keep hitting balls. And I haven't been to any courses, so it was rather fruitless and tiring 2hours. After that, it is affirmative that I need lessons. Haha.   It was almost 8 when we cleaned ourselves and head out for dinner. I guess it must be the holidays, most of the restaurants at the resort were booked out. So we had to settle for a yucky buffet bbq dinner that cost RM$54 per adult. That night, we plotted to get the 2 kids to sleep early so that the adults can have some booze and card game. It worked!  Day 2 was spent at the pool side and the beach. It was so sunny and hot that we can't stand sun bathing for more then 30mins, lieing still. But we still get a pretty good tan anyhow.. and I'm peeling already (1 wk later). We played pool, cycled, watched the monitor lizards and it's dinner time once again.   We went to the pool one last time on the 3rd day. And spent the rest of the day waiting.. queueing.. sweating. The custom and ferry terminal was so chaotic. There's no proper instructions and they can't speak much English. Lucky we have our BIL (he's a Malaysian-Chinese and speaks fluent Malay). We thot the ferry is due to leave at 2:30, but we board at that time, and depart at 3. Horrible organisation. By the time we reach Singapore, it was quarter past 9.   My poor niece must have been sea sicked. She threw up twice, the 2nd time was when we were waiting in the line to get off the ferry. Her mum was carrying her and none of us had hands to search for plastic/paper bag to contain her puke. Some passenger's luggage was on the aisle and had some of the puke and she went, "my bag!!!" unsympatheically. Some other passenger quickly pass some tissue for us. So kind of her. (She probably know how it's like to be a mother.) When my sis sarcastically offered tissue to the "my bag" lady, she rejected with a sympathetic look after her husband mumbled something to her.    Conclusion, no more long distant ferry trips. And enough of family trips for now.

      I'm tired. I think since last week, work has been stressful and tiring. Plus I don't know why I have been feeling a little blue. I am so looking forward to this long weekend. Can't wait to get on the ferry tomorrow morning to Pulau Tioman (one of Malaysia island).

      It was as if I walked with him, suffered with him. Emotionally, not physically.  Doubts flows through my head, Like how Satan tempted. Were these what went through his mind?  I questioned, cried, shrieked, and shivered. I cursed, prayed, reflected, and understood. No man could endured the journey.  The pain no man could withstood.  He came and took away our sins Through his sufferings. He spoke and told us the way Through him to God.  This is what I believe We serve the same God. In our own different ways. There's your belief and mine.  So respect each other. Love one another. Live life with love.  For we are loved.  I can go on and on But I have to sleep now I have to stop talking like this Or I'll go on and on.

      I'm bored with work. I'm not motivated or enthusiatic about work anymore. Why?  1. Work has become a routine. It's boring. 2. Suspect that I won't be retained in this job, hence no point working so hard to proof myself.  3. It is not my interest. (Then what is?) 4. There's no motivation (in terms of wealth, fame, recognition, challenge, satisfaction).   Maybe I need a break? :)) hahaha.. which I already had many. I think it's just the mood I'm in today. Just don't feel like doing anything at all.   I've a colleague who's on the same contract as me. She is very motivated and hardworking. More hardworking then some of the seniors here. I wonder what is her motivation. To be retained by the company? I guess that should be my motivation as well huh? I remembered being motivated, and wanting to learn more. I seem to have lost that since last month. I think I'm complacent. I dont see a future in this company, let alone this department/team. My prediction (which is always inaccurate) is my team will be 'cut' in 2 yrs. This department will be gone in... 3 yrs, and the company will pull out of Singapore in 5yrs. Unless, the marketing people can do some magic and bring in more sales, or the economy picks up within the next 5 yrs.   I think it is just my character. My motivation burns out real fast. No matter where I go, it'll be the same story.

      Charbs, my dear friend, called from the airport to chat. Finally, after 5 wks, I get to know what's up with him. I was surprised and thot it was some prankster but soon recognised that voice. It's always great to just listen to him.   My flu got worst. The sinus is so blocked that my tooth aches. The body is fighting very hard against the virus, cos I'm feeling feverish. So I went to the doc's after 5 days since the first visit and get a strong dosage of the meds. I hope it clears my sinus as it's really irritating not being able to breath well, eat well, sleep well. I just took the meds, and I'm very drowsy now but the sinus is still blocked and hurting!! Oh well, just hope I'll get better over the wkend or else I'll have to go the doc's again to get certified to be excused from work.   Time to let the body recuperate.. zzzzz

      For the sixth time in this year, I've caught the flu bug again. I asked the doc for a medical certificate to excuse me from work today and I slept until noon. I think the meds are working cos my sinus dont feel as clogged. I should believe I'll be better tomorrow, I have to, cos I might be going out partying. Hahaha..

      Don't get me wrong, I'm referring to a barbeque. One of us at work initiated the thought of having a barby and that's what we did today. After (almost) 2 wks of planning, 5 turned up for the barby (instead of 8). Some of them had to go for their mum's day celebration. One just didn't want to come. The reason given didn't really convince me.   Anyhow, we didn't succeed in playing mahjong (the other two gals were busy chopping and marinating meat), neither did I manage to have a dip at the pool. I end up being too hot and sticky to change out of my flithy clothes. The thot of changing back into those undergarments and clothes puts me off. It's better to stay with them until I get to the shower room at home.   Food was alright. As usual, we bought too much, and exceeded our budget. Sigh.. all those seafood. I bought a bottle of Lindeman's chardonnay and it sorta lighten up some of our moods and the night was beginning to be a little crazy and fun. Pity there's only enough for 5 full plastic cups. Anyhow, it was soon time to pack up and go. I'm greatful for my dear sis who drove all the way to pick me up. I was so tired and alcohol made me sleepy.  Still, I think barby is a hassle and dont wish to have another one. Unless I dont have to lift a finger.

      Went away over the weekend to North Malaysia, an island called Pulau Penang. It was almost a 12 hours coach ride to reach there. Would be shorter if not for the traffic jams along the way. The journey was alright, slept most of the time.  Sis' friend, Raph picked us up at the bus station and went straight to savour the local delights. When we were done with our breakfast, Raph was already planning where to for the next meal. Well, before coming, Sis told him that our objective was to eat.   After checking into the hotel and freshening up ourselves, Raph brought us to another round of eating. We were so stuffed after that and requested for some 'tourist visits' to the famous temples in Penang.   We decided to skip dinner and meet Raph for clubbing at night. In the meantime, we did a quickie at the nearby shopping center and bought a bottle of orange juice. We were quite disappointed that we couldn't get any bargains. But it is also due to the fact that we were all tired from the journey.  We napped for 4 hours and almost wanted to give up clubbing and carry on with the sleep. Glad we didn't. We went to two clubs and one of them was having ladies nights (on a weekend!?). I thought a little village like Penang won't have too great a nightlife but I think it was better then in Singapore.   Next morning, Raph met us at 1030 and we continued with our eating expedition. After breakfast, we were planning to take a scenic drive up to the mountains and the beach but decided to give up when the traffic was really slow. We shopped at another shopping center and got a better 'returns' this time round. After more slow traffic, we made it back to the hotel with 4 really full bladders. We relaxed and chatted in the room before making our way for dinner again. We had the apportunity to explore other parts of Penang apart from the beach and the town while driving to the seafood restaurant. Pity, the restaurant was full and we settled for a simple chinese restaurant further down the road.  That night, we sang our lungs out until 1am at a karaoke lounge next to our hotel. With coarse throats, we went back to our room and pack for our departure the next day.   Raph insisted on bring us out for a last breakfast before our coach leaves at 1030. It was really sweet of him to help us scout for coach back to S'pore since Monday. Our Penang trip couldn't be this great without him.    I use to think that Penang is a country-side-village. But it looks like Singapore 10yrs ago. They are developing, slowly. There are places that are run down, dilapitated and flirty. But there are also developments to improve on them. Of all the Malaysia states, I prefers Penang.   At the end of the trip, on the 10 hours ride home, we pondered about friendships. My sis asked me to join some social club to get to know more friends. Cos we realise that I don't have many, and can count on maybe just one. But isn't one better then none? Anyhow..I don't want to think about this. I have my own mind and plans. I will do what I please, when I'm ready.

      Oops, folks are thinking that I'm depressed after reading my blog. I can't help writing down things that are going through my mind. And I realise that I tend to get melancholy as I write. Or maybe philosophical stuff are serious, or I can't joke about it? Or I don't know how to take it on a different perspective?  I value your comments, appreciate your concerns and thanks for reading. I will try to improve on that. Otherwise, people will stop coming to my blog. Hahah.. too sad already!  Oh, incase you are wondering, I'm not depress (maybe only when I was writing it).

      It was a rather long journey. First the train, then the bus, finally the bumboat. It was my first time to  urlLink Pulau Ubin . I had always been told by my sisters that it's a dangerous place to cycle. Rough terrains for a so-so cyclist like me. Well, that was a couple of years ago. The island had went thru some 'upgrading' since then. And I've come to realise that as long as you are not speeding, you can maneuver between the rocks, roots and wild animal poo. Just like driving; it gives you time to react.   Going through the roads and trails, taking in the fresh air, fighting the bugs *scratch scratch*, avoiding the rocks and poos, there's still time to think about life philosophy.   Uphill is tiring and dreadful. But I had to keep going cos I want to ride the downhill. Wind in the hair, feeling the thrill as the speed picks up, almost wanted to lift up the arms and close my eyes. But I didn't want to crash and die.   The trails required concentration (for me ie.). When you focused on the every rocks and bumps to avoid, you missed the beautiful things worth seeing. But it was for my arse and I don't want to fall. Does that reflect how I journey my life?  I brought my APS camera along, an attempt to use up my expired film. I wonder how it'll turn out. (You'll see it if it's good.)  After some bites and brusies, I head home for a quick shower and went to Fort Canning for Starlight Movies. It was a great night. We had food, wine, great laugh and sobs. Lucky for us, it wasn't too humid that night. I had blogged in more details at  urlLink BHG blog .

      It has been a while since I last blogged here. I have shorter and more frequent entries at zorpia as it's interface is easier and faster to blog. In a way, "Mi Viaje" has bcome my sanctuary of thots and emotions.    The REAL working world ======================= My boss encouraged us to sign up for courses to update ourselves. One of my fellow attachment trainee (A) was rather proactive in signing up courses. For the nature of our attachment, we should be getting more trainings. Initially we thought the manager will arrange and plan the trainings for us. However, we learned that we had to do it ourselves. This was only made known 2 months before the end of the contract. My fellow colleague (A) was kind enough to ask if I was interested in one of the course and consulted the manager for me, and another colleague (B). The manager replied that only 2 are allowed. So I told A that I'm willing to give up my chance since I'm not so keen in that topic. However, we were advised a few days later by our team leader that B and another senior engineer had already signed up for the course. I felt unjust and betrayed. It is understandable that B signed up before us but it is not acceptable that she was dishonest to A. When A had asked if she's interested, she should have told him that she had signed up! Even if she missed this chance, she could have told him when the email to ask the manager for permission was cc-ed to her! All this time she chosed to keep it to herself.   I knew she's 'fake'. On the surface, she's nice. (infact, she's particularly nice to senior staff.) But you can see that she has her reason to be nice. (bcos you are beneficial to her.) It's hard to work with someone like that. When you walk over to ask her qtns, her answers will always be brief. She'll not give you everything. Afterall, knowledge is power. It amazes me how one can acquire a skill like that when she's 24 and has only been in the working for at most 1yr. Oh well, maybe I'm wrong about her.   Disappointing ============== When I ask friends out for something, I often get rejected. Althou I'm always disappointed, I get over it almost immediately, on some cases. But as it accumulates, it's frustrating. Esp when the invitation list is not short. I thot it is a basic courtesy to REPLY to the person who sent that email? Isn't that the basic ettique? However, several times I had to ASK for a reply. It made me feel like I'm BEGGING people to come out and play. There's a reason why you receive that email you know? Are these people dumb or what?! I think institution have to teach them about nettique.   So I learn. I won't wait, I won't ask, I won't beg. The invitation is sent, and being an adult, you have the decency to reply if you are interested. Understood.   BUT!! Don't these people wanna have fun? It disappointing esp when you indicate its a gathering and put in nice words to hope they'll turn up. But you get, "don't know.. maybe I'll not come.. " "do what? huh? just that? err I'll think about it." LOOK, if you dont give a damn, you have the liberty to say no! I think all they could think of is themselves. Fuck them. I'll have my fun and pity them for their pathetic, insecure life!

      When there's a bump or dent on the road, do you  1) just drive over it? 2) slow down and drive over it? 3) go around it to avoid?  Is escaping the best solution? A rational person will say no. Then why do people think of running away when they meet an obstacle? Ending a life, will it end all troubles? Is that a coward's behaviour? For me, I must be out of my mind, lost my rationale before I can do it.  Will you come out a stronger man? Will you beable to overcome your obstacle and embrace the next one? Will you complain when the road is smooth, and lament when its rough?   It's all in your mind. Things happen for a reason. Open your eyes and mind, look around you. If something can happen to them, it could happen to you too. So try to put yourself in their situation. Learn from their mistakes. The world don't revolve around you. You are given this opportunity, don't waste it.   A journey can hardly be free of bumps or dents. Don't wish that hurdles don't come your way cos it will. Without it, you won't learn, grow or appreciate. Since it's there on your path, you can't do anything about it, why not just embrace and learn to deal with it?  Life is never perfect. Life is never a bed full of roses. I know you have been through hardships, you are not alone. Share your wisdom, and learn from others.   Things happen for a reason. Don't ignore it. Don't you think it make life more colourful?  You come naked, you'll go not taking anything with you. Everything is just a passing dust cloud.

      Staring at screen and don't know what to write. I have been writing about my feelings too much. Let's break things down into category then.  Work: A new testing cycle started and that means I've stuff to do again. Actually, it's irresponsible of me to say that I've nothing to do cos it is my job to find things to do. I needed something to start my engine running, and while it is running, I'll be motivated enough to find things to do. I cannot tolerate "off-peak" seasons when I wonder each morning what's there to accomplish. I think I should set deadlines for the tasks on hand, cos deadlines give me pressure, and that's what I need to keep moving. In 3 1/2 weeks I'll know my future in the company. It is their deadline and mine to decide if my contract with them terminates in July or in another 2 yrs. I am not hoping for the best or preparing for the worst. I'll take it as it come. God has plans for me. I will handle whatever situation he put me in. So exciting! ^o^  Money: Well, I have to tighten my belt, hold my purse strings tight cos what I have now will have to last me longer then usual. Being a spend thrift, I can't help pampering myself once a while. Just a couple of days ago, I spent about $5 more for lunch (which is usually $2-3). That will probably be the last time until I get another pay check or strike the lottery.   Health: I'm recovering! Yippee. My teeth and gum were aching because of my sinus. I was told that I was having virus infectious, rather then flu since it has been more then 2 weeks. So I'm on antibiotics now and that helped cleared my throat and nose. My left cheek (the sinus) still aches sometimes but I'm just glad that I'm not coughing like I'm choking. My list of cravings is expanding and I need to recover soon!  Love: I've written everything abt this topic. My opinions are still unchanged. No new developments as yet. =) Mum is still as concern why I'm not meeting more friends, finding a boyfriend. Should have told her that my friends are mostly guys and there's only 1 or 2 gals. A colleague told me to change myself to appeal to more guys (or that one guy of interest). Firstly, it is certainly not my character to do that. I can't pretend and changing takes a helluva time. Secondly, what are the things that most guys look for in a gal? Aren't they boobs and butts? Haha.  Family: "The crisis" is still going on. I don't know if there's any improvement but we've got some external help to assist. My dad is getting impatient and frustrated. My mum got hints of it and she's very cooperating. As for the siblings, worried, impatient, and wondering when will it come to a conclusion. We are all praying very hard. (Which reminds me to go to church tmr, to fulfil the deal i struck with God.)  I just got an idea for blog. =D Until then, take care, good luck, love one another (including ur enemy) and I love you.

      Alone in the house again. Just me, with the computer, the radio, and the noise from the street, surfing the web, reading the blogs, coughing my lungs out.  I realised its 1 June, and my sick computer that I promised to fix since Jan is still covered with dust. I will get to it soon, I have to, and I will do that.. this weekend maybe? Hehee.. Such a procrastinator.  On the subject of the matter of the heart, there seem to be new developments. Nope, no new guy (before you start speculating). Previously, I was afraid of falling in love. I don't know if I will ever, and if I should because I was afraid of the pain I might go through (as much as i enjoy pain haha). However, along the way (in the past 6 mths), I opened up my heart and mind again. I don't put a permanent "No entry" sign to love. Should love find me, I'll be ready to ride the emotion rollercoaster. And that kind of mindset still stands.   When I said developments, I was referring to a greater subject of love - marriage. With the change of time, society changes. Although weddings touch me (always sob at weddings.. :~( ), increasing divorced couples made me lost faith with marriage. These days, signing on the dotted line, vowing "till death do us part" do not mean any binding agreement or contract anymore. The couples are not promised of anything. (Maybe they should revise the wedding vow.) To me, marriage is only for the purpose of having children - starting your own family. Having said that, it doesn't mean that I won't consider marriage. I just have to be prepared, mentally and financially that the marriage might not work out. It is just how it is in the society now. Mankind have different attitude now. I may be able to be sure about myself but I won't know about my partner. People changes (I finally had to accept that) and s/he might not be the same person when you first met. I think I've also lost faith in man. Hahaha  My sis' advice - be in as much relationships as you can. Get broken hearted, it's ok.   She's right. It sort of prepares you. Then I'm dead!! I'm into my 26th years and I only have...have...*counting* 1 relationship!! ONE! Uno!! Satu!! 1!! From the look of it, I don't think more will be coming. Should I say it's just fate, or it's the way my life is, or it's the way how I lead my life? Even if I extend my options to the same sex, I still won't have that kind of 'fate'. Trust me. I know me, I know my life.   Well, of cos I can do something about it. Go out, get to know more people, widen your circles.. yeah yeah yeah, but not now. It's not my prioity now. (Does that sound like a procrastinator to u?)  So what's the conclusion? Take it as it comes (seem to have bcome my motto). You can never be prepared of whatever challenges that may hit you. In time of crisis, what do you need?   1. Time. To sort out the mind and emotion.  2. Friends/Family/Confidant. Someone you can unload to. Someone who can help you see out of the picture. You know, it's hard to see when you are in it. (See point 5) 3. Money. When you need to drown your sorrows, you gotta need money to buy those booze!! Hahha..  4. Self esteem. No matter what happen, don't forget yourself.  5. ME!!! =)  [If you are reading this, it means you belong to my exclusive club and hence this 5th point will be applicable to you. *wink* You need to know that I'll be here, if you need me. I may not do wonders but I'll do within my means.]  p/s: This is a super long blog. By the time I'm done, I'm no longer alone like the first paragraph. Haha.

      I didn't mean to neglect this blog. I was distracted and occupied - hence I was busy. Haha.   Update, update..&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;coming thursday is my&nbsp;last day at work. The company is downsizing and they had asked 3 engineers to leave. 2 in US, 1 in S'pore and she's my mentor. The CEO is coming down next&nbsp;Monday. As they said, CEO&nbsp;don't&nbsp;visit for no reason.&nbsp;He came to S'pore office once before, and that was like 5 yrs ago when they opened this office. So, we already know what this means. Lucky for me, I'm on contract and it has come to an end.   I'm job hunting. It has been about 2-3 weeks, coming to a mth and I'm tired of hunting. And I've lost my grip. I don't know what I want, and I don't think I am capable of. And I need money!!!   My bil has moved out. He is given a mth to think about/of his options and decisions. This will also give the couple a breather, and my sis a preview of what and how it'll be like should things don't work out. The Lim sisters aren't optimistic. My parents are still hopeful. They had gone to marriage counselling where my sis works so we get some feedback from the professionals. She asked us not to be too hopeful. So it probably won't look too good. If you ask me if this episode had affected me, it certainly had changed my perception. But that's a whole new blog entry. haha  No matter what life obstacles are being presented, we have to brace ourselves up and learn to face it. You can only dwell for so long but not too long cos there are other people on the line, waiting for you, affected by you. The world doesn't stop spinning. This will be how your story be like, so live it.   (that's what i think, but i don't know if it was me, i would beable to do so. but at least, its some encouragement for myself, should i be caught in difficult situation.)   I've been blessed all my life. Now that I've move onto working adult life, there'll be&nbsp;more to come, and I must be brave enough to face it. In work, in relationships, love life, family, marriage, whatever. Life isn't always a&nbsp;bed of roses. Thing won't always come so easy. That, I have to remind myself. =)   I'm leaving this Sat for San Francisco.. woohoo! Speaking of blessed life, haha, my dear sis subsidised my air fares to let me join her in her biz trip. We both have been there, but it'll be a good break for us. :) So excited.. cos I didn't really enjoy it the first time I was there. I'll be back on 10 Aug.   &nbsp;

      My sis has a strings of biz trips to make. She don't like them. But now, the only perks is, I'm jobless and I can tag along! So she invited me to join her in San Francisco for about a week in August. If the air tickets are confirmed, I'll be flying off on 31 Jul and be home 10 days later - 10 Aug. Isn't that great?! Although I've been to that part of America, I didn't mind at all cos the last time I didn't get to see much of SFO, esp the Fisherman's Wharf.   But I feel guilty, that I'm not earning, jobless and still making a such an expensive trip. :P I'm investing about $2-3K into this trip. Really quite outrageous. But if I don't do it now, when will I have the time and company?   Another trip I have in mind is a volunteering program. A grp of 25 will be at Cebu, Philippines for 3 weeks to help them build schools, set up computers, conduct trainings and such and such. It is subsidised for those below 30yrs old so I'll just need to pay $600. Cebu is a wonderful place to dive. It'll be so idea to volunteer and then dive afterwards! *drool*. This takes place in Dec but I have to register by Aug 23. The problem is, can I commit the whole of Dec to Philippines? (It's rather dangerous - lotsa kidnapping of foreigners.) What about work? That's the draw back. I can't commit at the moment. Another obstacle is, going alone. My siblings either aren't keen or can't commit. Same goes for friends. And my parents will NEVER let me go alone, esp to such 'dangerous' place. (Actually, to my mum, everywhere is dangerous. 8-|. Even to Pulau Ubin. She goes on like this, we'll never learn.) This is really a good time. Right age, right attitude.. I just need to make that commitment.  Just hope I'll find a job soon to finance my travel plans. I'm itching for diving already. =P

      Scanned 8 of the 30 over pix taken during my 'expedition' to Pulau Ubin. Very amaturish. A lot were out of focus cos I didn't look into the view finder (is that what u call it?). They were taken with my Canon IXUS (i think, haha) APS camera. The film had expired for almost a yr.  Click  urlLink here   to view.

      My training/internship ends on 30 July. We finally met up with the director on 29 June to touch base on our predicament. Prior to that, there had already been information flying around. 1 to 2, 2 to 4. It came to a point where I felt overloaded with 'secrets'. Like a over absorbed sponge, information got leaked out. Who got the right version of the rumour? I don't really care. I only want to know who get retained. After much speculation, we were surprised that the company could only afford ONE headcount. Although I've lucky-guessed it, I'm still quite taken aback that my dept got none.   The company did not do so well for Q2, CEO was quoted "disappointed" to the sales result. Although Asia Pacific did extremely well, it wasn't enough to cover for US/Europe. Initially my mgr seem to be hopeful, and very eager to meet the VP to try to bargain for at least one 'slot' for my dept. After the release of the CEO's stmt, his hope vanished. Now, their concern is to keep the current heads. Finger crossed that there won't be retrenchments.  It was quite a dramatic week I'd say. Speculations and expectations. It was so exciting! But at the same time upsetting. For one, I felt sort of betrayed by a fellow colleague.   This colleague had knowledge of another avail. vacancy, and it's not hopeful for my dept but he chose to keep mum. I can't blame him. It's his nature. But to think I had worried for him, called him up to let him know of the job vacancy and to be told that he had knew about it couple of mths back. Bastard! I was such an idiot at that point. I was still thinking, "oh good.. u had been considered. so you have chance.." instead of "u knew! and didn't tell me?!". My processor is too slow, needs an upgrade! It saddens me. I thot we started out as a group and we'll watch each others back. I'm so wrong. Then again, it's fortunate that there's not knives or daggers sticking out from my back.   Some kind of a team I have. The interns at the other dept are so much more mature. Mine will compete, get jealous, retain information, make use, blah blah blah. That's prob why I made good friends out of those at the other dept.   Now that the whole saga has settled down, I finally had time to sit here and type my blog. It had been a great year. Made some great friends, learn some new things (about weird, strange and scheming people), boosted my resume with a MNC name, gained exposure.. Can't wait to find out what I'll land myself next. =)

      There is a reason I'm here. Why did I get in? Why did I feel a silent content when you are here? It can be done in minutes but I choose to linger on. Have I lost my rationale? Did I fail to perceive like before? Is my heart ruling now? What is the reason? You are.

      3rd sis wanted to shop at Kuala Lumpur over the long weekend on 7 Aug (9 Aug being the National Day). 3 of us and her boyfriend got up at 6am and made our way to the Tuas second link to Malaysia. I was famished so we stopped by to have breakfast. When we reached the custom, it was almost 8 and there was already a traffic jam. I guess everyone was taking advantage of the long weekend to go somewhere. Precisely why we got up so early - to avoid the jam!! But we end up being stuck in it for 3 hours or so. Originally a 3 hrs road trip to KL (at a conservative 120km/hr speed) became 8 hrs, thanks to the jam when entering M'sia and Kuala Lumpur. Well, even the locals drive to KL from other states.  While we were speeding, our driver was in a daze when he over took a traffic police and sped up. Of cos we were asked to pull over and the local police threatened to issue a summon. We knew he wanted $ and the market rate is RM50. So driver bargained with him, "Sir, help me reduce lah." "How much you want me to reduce?" "50?" "(roll eyeballs) aiya, 50?! no lah!" "ah? then? 100?" "ok lah. ok lah." After that, driver was very awake and learnt from his poor negotiating skills.  This trip was quite impromtu. It was impossible to find any hotels. Even the most lousy ones were full! (Including those that are haunted. : ) Lucky for my sis' great network, we bunked in with her friend's friend's condo for a night. We were lucky to find a place to stay, for free too. We counted our blessing when there were three mattresses and water (not hot) to wash up. Good thing we had taken precautions. We brought our own pillows, cushions and warm clothings for the cold night. It was dusty and quite dirty but it sure beats sleeping in the car.  When we were packing and going through our stuff the next morning, we realised that 2nd sis' passport wasn't stamped by the Malaysia custom on entry. This will cause a lot of troubles as we read from previous reports on the news. It usually requires some under table $ too. This was the first time the "passport-in-charge" forgot to check for entry stamps when we pass the custom and it had to happen to be the first time one passport didn't get stamped. We called the tourism board and were told that it "shouldn't be a problem". We wonder since we had the impression that the Malaysia bureaucrats are difficult. When we reach the departing custom, sis was directed to another office. As the computer had her entry record, and she still had her custom "white-card" that had a entry stamp, the officer just made a note and stamped her passport for exit. *phew* It wasn't as bad as we thought.  Interesting experiences. Lotsa lesson learnt.  This will be the last time we make last minute travel arrangements.

      Suddenly, I felt shallow. Is it because I'm too happy and contented with my current life that I've missed other elements of life? I haven't been thinking deeply these days. I don't think I have the capacity now. Does it only come to me when I'm lonely and sad? Haha. Maybe, since you'll have more mental energy and little distractions to see, look, feel, think, consider. It isn't a bad thing at all. It's stages or phases of life that one goes through. I believe things happen for a reason. It prepares you for what may come. What you've gone thru let you appreciate the present, understand the past, handle the future.  I'm still walking. Learning everyday with each obstacles I face. I'm sure I'll be better as we go along.

      Well, I'm still in Singapore instead of US. :P My sis got a better job offer and resigned from her current work, hence it's not required of her to travel to US. So we cancelled my air ticket and paid a small fee for it.  Last week has been slow at work. Spent my time clearing work, surfing, chatting, dozing and eating farewell lunches and dinners. The director and mangers brought us to Fullerton Hotel's Town Club for a buffet lunch. Food there sucks. Standard price of $30-ish but food is sub-standard. Don't know why my director likes that place. She often suggest to eat there when it's claim-able. Oh, and the head chef is her PRIMARY (elementary) schoolmate. So? Food still sux.  One thing I didn't like about that lunch was all the mentors in my dept were not invited whereas all the mentors in the other dept (headed by the director) were present. My dept were asked to nominate 2, so the team leader went, and asked us to vote for one mentor to go. Such a silly and wierd method. They couldn't decide among themselves so resorted to this voting means. It's like voting for your favourite mentor. But the basis of my vote was who will enjoy the food better.   Even thou the food sux, I still got full from trying a little of everything. On the same day, the mentors of my dept treated us to Gurame at ECP. Food aint fantastic, company aint great. Everyone were full from the buffet lunch to really enjoy the food fully. It could be better.  The next day, a fellow colleague celebrated his birthday with some of us by buying us dinner at Sushi Tei. OOhh.. yuuummyyyy.... I'm still reminiscencing it. Ginger slices with salmon and wasabi is sooo... sweeeet to the palate. (Hungry)  So what's now? I'm going to Bintan with a friend for a short break. That's to compensate for the US trip. Haha. Well, now my sis might have a longer break in between her job. She's planning on a Europe trip to Spain and Paris, and I'm invited!!! Woohooo!! But.. too early to get excited. Nothing is concrete yet. But the thot is exciting! ¡España, aqui vengo!
