       got my license this morning!! I'm happy, I feel so independent-ish even though I think I'm gonna make my mom ride with me in van a bit more before I actually try to take it out by myself. But still. And my license picture isn't too bad, I look like an elf! lol...  gotta go DRIVE MYSELF (!!!) to Hobby Lobby!

       I feel much better now...not so guilty. In another sense, I feel icky, really dizzy and my stomach's still kinda upset. but oh well. I can't believe I'm updating this again...it's the second day in a row!! of course, it is new....and I don't have to worry about anyone reading it....'spretty cool.  I can't wait for school to start, thank goodness for wednesday. Maybe I'm weird....I just want to be able to have some social contact (although, this is Recluse Lydia I'm talking about...) and stop hanging around being bored all day every day. Plus I'll get to drive, woohoo.  Speaking of driving, I should get my license tomorrow. I mean, I AM going to get my license tomorrow. I guess I should look over my rule-booky-thingy but I'm really not too nervous, I know the test and I know I'm a good driver, and I don't have to drive the manual for the test. So even though I haven't driven for a week or so, I still think I'll pass. I'd better pass, because I refuse to take the MTD and have to walk all the way to that bus stop, it's insane. sigh.  I hope my mum gets my clothing allowance taken care of tomorrow so I can get some jeans...I don't really have a pair I'm willing to wear to school. and I did my job, I figured it all out and typed it up and printed it and submitted it for her approval...so technically she should really take care of it. I wouldn't mind having some of the rest of thatstuff before school starts, either.  I wonder if she's just gonna let me use my credit card for my allowance this time. Even though it's not a cash card, but she keeps saying she trusts me, so...it's cool though, I feel so powerful with that thing. I think maybe I need to ask her to make "emergency" more specific, lol...  once again, I have no idea how this post ended up so long. wow.

       so it took me forever to find a web address that was "available". grr, who is the world (besides me, of course) would want fasterthanaspeedingwart or gagmewithaspork or lollyronismyhero or mucwerqubinwips or any of those other crazy things I came up with!! It was so frustrating!! everyone else knows my inside jokes with myself! *sob* I feel so...so violated!!!  on a different subject, I'm feeling really horrible. Which I guess is a good thing since I'm going to to end up lying and saying I threw up and passed out and went to the emergency room, etc etc as an excuse as to why I didn't show up at the movie I was supposed to go to with Merry and Aaron today. The truth is...Merry couldn't go and I refused to go without her, aka by myself. To those people who told me to just go alone, shut up. I need a buffer, ok, I couldn't go by myself, I was already feeling sick just about the idea of going WITH MERRY. And now I feel really guilty but I can't feel TOO guilty because I understand why I did it. I know people are gonna be really fed up with me....oh well. I'm afraid to answer the phone now, I'm avoiding windows, jumping at any sound....I hate this.  I doubt I'll be updating this real often, because I have a livejournal that I really like, and then I also have a xanga, which I don't like so much...and now this, too. oh well, I like blogger, maybe I'll get around to it.  hmm, now that I've seen so many commercials with Michael Phelps in them during the Olympics, I'm starting to agree with Grace. He IS hot. If only I didn't always have to see him in speedos. *shudder* Women's trampoline is on tomorrow, I'm so excited!! Trampoline rocks.  wow, it's amazing how much I'm rambling. Possibly it's because I'm home alone and hiding, which includes sitting her in the basement with the curtains closed, not on AIM, not on MSN, avoiding windows, not answering the phone. hey!! I've just realized, it's the return of Recluse Lydia!! Recluse Lydia is a paranoid delusional freak, who has no social life and at any sign of getting one reverts back to standing people up and hiding in her basement. Recluse Lydia is a jerk and Recluse Lydia is feeling guilty and very ashamed of Recluse Lydia at the moment. Recluse Lydia wishes she could call Lisa but seeing as it's a thursday afternoon and Lisa DOES have a social life/boyfriend and Recluse Lydia does not especially want to pay the phone bill resulting from the talk she needs to have with Lisa, it is not exactly likely that Recluse Lydia will get to talk to Lisa any sooner than saturday, whcih is two days away, which mean Recluse Lydia has about 2 days of feeling horrible and not being able to vent on anyone, and will be forced to rant on her online journals, subjecting any of you poor people who are unfortunately reading this to huge paragraphs told by Recluse Lydia in the third person, further proof of her insanity and need to be put into one of those way cool padded rooms. *gasp*  wow, I'm rambling way too much....think I'm going to....leave now....not that I know what else I could do...but yeah. If you read all of this, maybe you should go see a psychiatrist...haha.
