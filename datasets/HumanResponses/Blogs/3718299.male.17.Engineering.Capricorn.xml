      Well my life has been good, ok, and just plane ugly in the past few days.  I really don't remember what I did sunday, which could be a good thing, or really bad, but if I don't remember, it really couldn't have been good.  Monday I went to Summerfest with Mandi, a friend of mine.  I took a half day of work, so I was there by 12:30 and didn't leave until a little before 12:00am.  We wanted to see Blink 182, which they were giving out free seats for (grass of coarse).  Her boyfriend kept telling us they were gonna be out by the time we got there, but when we did, they had their pockets full of wristbands, that crazy Chris!  We got our wristbands and wandered the grounds until Chris got off of work at 5.  We ended up watching this Greg guy from Dream Street, I had a blast with that situation!  I was screaming, as hight pitched as I could, asking if he would be the father of my children, among other things, mocking the die hard fans.  We ended up getting his autograph and both me and Mandi made asses outta ourselves when we talked to him... it was really funny.  I decided that I wasn't gonna wear what I was wearing and had to buy all new clothes while down there.  I bought a new tie die shirt, which cost $5 and fits pretty nicely for being a Childrens XL.  I also bought a trucker hat that was custom sprayed with "DDR Player" on it... I screwed that up, I shoulda got "DDR Playa" instead.  I took a bunch of pins from the Sobe stand and stuck them all over me too.  I decorated my skin full of temporary tatoos from Kiss FM, Rock 102.1, and Sobe.  I had one in the middle of my forhead which was HILARIOUS!  At 5, Chris got off and a girl he was working with, Haley, walked around with us.  We walked around as a group for about an hour, just before the gates opened for the Blink show.  I went to the gates, waited in line and got in within 10 minutes.  Mandi and Chris "caught up on things" while me and Haley talked.  Haley's cousin was in from Seattle and sat with us too... that was a trip.  He kept disappearing and coming back with other people... kinda weird.  Finally the show started and we all rocked our fucking brains out.  In the middle of the show, Jack or whatever Haley's cousin's name is, decided he was gonna give me one hellova wedgie!  That really hurt, I couldn't stop laughing though.  I had a blast at the concert, moshing, head banging and flipping my hands around... oh yeah, I got to say  the f bomb out loud which was fun!  Chris and Mandi magically wandered off before the end to go to the So-Co concert.  Jack or whatever his name is was gone and it was as you guessed it, me and Haley.  After, we left to go find Mandi and Chris, conveniently couldn't find them and we had to walk, just to two of us, until the concert was over.  I had no problem talking to her with my posse (hahahaha, posse) to back me up, but as soon as it was just me and her, it got weird.  To make the madness even madder, apparently she liked me when she saw me early in the afternoon and Chris knew it (boo Chris).  Of coarse, I really have no experience in the department and the conversation kinda went nowhere for quite some time.  Finally I tried to get her to "lose interest" by telling her I was normally a preppy pompus prick.  That didn't scar her (aww damn).  I then told her, my life is messed up... my dad died, me and my mom barely get along, yata yata yata, and evidently, that's her exact same life... so right now she thinks we are soulmates.  We ended up sitting and talking about why I wouldn't go out with her for damn near an hour.  I made myself sound like this complicated kid who was afraid of EVERYTHING.  So in the end, I made a deal with her, I have to call her to hang out, or she will stalk me... which kinda was weird cause having a stalker would be pretty funny... but on the other hand it could get really annoying.  I walked her by the exit, said goodnight and at the same time, the concert ended and I waited for Mandi and Chris to find me.  Chris drove us both to my car so I could take Mandi home (what a boyfriend, j/k).  I yelled at Chris because he knew the entire time what her intentions were, making him an accomplice to the whole thing.  We got back to my car and I drove Mandi home.  We spent the entire time talking about how I have this stalker on my ass who told me I have to take risks and jump off cliffs (not literally, you know pretend ones :p).  That brings us to today.  I sat at work, all bored, nothing to do.  At lunch I went out and bought the John Mayer album that has been out for a while cause I'm going to see him on Friday (I hope).  That made the day go somewhat quicker and my mood chaged a lot.  While at work, I recieved an Email from Red Octane about some sponsorship I had asked them for.  They wanted me to send in photos, before and after me losing weight so my request would be quickened some (those jerks).  I got home and had to get some new pictures of myself... wearing my new clothes that I just wore yesterday.  I look completely different compared to the person I was a little more then a year ago.  While sending the pictures to RO, I got another email from Cobalt Flux, informing me that they are sending me 2 pads (almost $700).  They are skipping me ahead in the line, and shipping the stuff out on thursday so it arrives on time (WOOHOO!).  I was so excited.  I'm hoping RO sends some soft pads and maybe a metal pad for the event.  I can't believe all this is working so perfectly (well minus Konami not contacting me about my request).  I then made a short video of me playing DDR for the manager of Senor Lunas so he could see what DDR was.  I get to debut the video sometime in the next two days.  I can't wait now... everything is working out perfectly.  John Mayer of Friday (oh and a court date), sleep in on Saturday, and sunday find something to do.  Then the following week will go kinda slow, but there is no work on Monday so it will go semi quicker.  Then Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, it's DDR at Lunas!  YEA!

      Well I kinda skipped a day :p.  I really haven't had much happen in my life though.  Yesterday I sat at home playing a little DDR and that's about it.  Oh wait, I watched Tough Crowd (Well I do everynight) which was pretty funny.  It was kinda racist but it was good.  Today I went to work.  The day was soooo slow.  Finally at around 3:30, the work started piling up cause everyone found something for me to do.  That kinda made me argry, but I got out at like 4:05 which was good.  I got home and walked down to my neighbors house to give my sister some money that I owed her.  While down there, I had to listen to little kids make fun of me for not having a girlfriend (something about them taunting me by singing Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" made it almost unbearable).  Speaking about that song, people think it's funny to start playing it while I'm in the car with them.  It's almost a ritual with them.  I kinda became immune to it, but when little kids sing it, it kinda hurts :p  After that, I went inside, fooled around on the computer and then went out to eat.  We went out for a fish fry at Edgewater Golf Coarse.  I had the cod which was awsome.  I ate so much, I can barely move now.  There's really no chance of me playing DDR tonight.  I was planning on going to Summerfest tonight, but the person I made plans with kinda blew me off.  Doesn't really bother me, but I guess it does enough that I write about it.   You know those kids go me to thinking.  I need a girlfriend, but not just any girl, the girl of my dreams.  I kinda narrowed it down, but I still have never met the person that makes time stand still (Big Fish).  I know this sounds corny, but love at first sight is the only way to go.  But then again, what if I loved the person instantly but they didn't... what happens then?  Are we ment to be together still or should it all just end right there?  Relationships are crazy and if I went in depth with my thoughts about them, the world would think I'm crazy.  Maybe I'll expand on this tomorrow since it's the weekend and I'll have nothing better to talk about :D

      Well today wasn't too shabby.  I mean work sucked some what, but when doesn't it?  I spent most of the day just chillin' on the internet looking for some new games and talking to some people.  I bought a domain today for my webite.  I officially own http://www.ddrtourney.com for a whole year.  I also uploaded my website to the new server.  I need to finish updating it, but it will soon be ready to be the new site.  I also got my PS2 USB converter to play DDR today.  I was setting it up and plugging it in and my back went out!  OUCH!  How many 17 year olds have bad back problems like that?  Maybe I should just get back surgery now before I turn 40 and have to do it then :p.  My back was sore, but I still played StepMania.  Had a great time while doing so.  I took a break for a while and played some Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow online (just bought that yesterday).  I'm not very good, but I'll get better.  I was so tired after playing DDR for a while more, I had to play some Gunbound.  That game is fun.  I played in the newbie server and had the time of my life.  Only problem was I lagged out of two games cause my brother was hogging all the bandwidth on PS2 :(.  Then I came to write in my blog... that's where I'm at now.  Can't wait to see if tomorrow is even better.  Until then TTFN :D

      Thursday I got my ACT scores back... scored a 26, math and science both being my strong point (as usual) with a 30 for math and a 28 for science.  English again was my weak point with a 20.  I'm pretty happy with my scores, but still wish i scored atleast a 28, but I really can't complain.  I also went out and bought all new clothes, $200 in fact.  I felt so cool trying on mediums and largest and actually having them fit.  I think I didn't do half bad buying everything and can't wait to go again!  Well on Friday, I had a courtdate in the morning for a disorderly conduct thingy.  The Prosecutor said they are putting a one year hold on the charges, meaning if I get caught doing anything illegal, minus speeding, I will be charged with the disorderly conduct.  That's a good thing, only cause it won't be on any of those college applications and other things.  I went to Summerfest again on Friday.  I asked my friend Phil if he wanted to go with me, which was somewhat a mistake.  This guy, an 18 year old, probably only 5 feet tall and is covered in hair really thought he had the ladies by a fricken string.  He talked all the way down there about how all these girls were gonna give him is number and da da da dada.  We get down there, walk to the north entrence to get closer to the spot to get wristbands for the John Mayer concert.  We get in, and get some of the last wristbands... that was a close call.  We now had 6 hours to blow before we could go to the concert.  We walked around for a while, stopping to watch things along the way.  After about an hour Phil decides he wants to call his friend Brad, who really couldn't be classified as "normal".  We find him and he walks around with us for the rest of the afternoon.  Phil sits there the entire time whispering to me how Brad is scaring all the girls away and we have to ditch him... so I tell Phil if we ditch him cause he's scaring all the girls away, then I gotta ditch Phil cause he's having the same effect on me... needless to say, Phil didn't ditch Brad after that.    We stopped at the Millar Oasis stage to watch this band called Upside Groove Coalition or something like that.  They were excellent... we stood right up front, having a great time... Brad more then all of use because he's headbanging to it, but the sad thing was it really wasn't anything to headband to... more of a rock mixed with jazz mixed with well rap... it was kinda a mix of everything, but they sounded real good. Midway though the concert, these three girls walk behind us... I thought they were cute but really thought nothing of it.  They then kept looking our way, mind you Brad stopped headbanging and was sitting on the bench with Phil and no one was in front of use so it was obvious they were looking our way.  So I tell Phil about them... Phil goes and looks, but thinks I'm talking about an entirely different group of girls... GRRRR!  The girls walk behind us again, stop at the outside of the bleechers, practically calling our (you know when I say our, I really mean ME, but don't wanna sound so conceded) names.  This time I tell Phil "Dude, they are checking YOU out", hoping to get him to go over there with me.  Phil decides that his "sex appeal" as he called it is to blame, but won't do anything about it... Jesus... this kid is pissing me off now.  The girls walk away, which pissed me off, but came back a little more then ten minutes later, standing in the same spot... Phil is too chicken again to go over with me.  Now I am a chicken too when it comes to that stuff, but if I have someone to back me up, I don't have such a problem with it... and Phil is no support by making stupid jokes outta things like that.  Needless to say, I didn't talk to them, didn't get a number, didn't get anything but a huge feeling of regret after I walked right pass them as their backs were turned... God damn!  We went to the John Mayer concert, waited in line, finally ditching Brad cause he didn't have a wristband (THANK GOD), but my entire trip to Summerfest was doomed when I decided to go with Phil.  You see, Phil has this tendency to just get up and... wander... wander where you may ask... wander NO WHERE... he just gets up, walks around and comes back in 20 minutes, leaving me on a grass hill, saving the perfect spots we had fought so hard to get.  Any time Phil decided to walk off, I was stuck waiting, usually laying down, taking in the sun... I love the sun.  During one of Phil's wandering escapades, I started talking to these two girls, one of which was single I assumed... we really didn't get to talking about anything in particular when Phil walked back and the first thing outta his mouth is something stupid to the lines of "Jesse... looks like you found one", patting me on the back, resulting in the two girls sliding quickly away and later leaving the area.  Now ordinarily, that comment really wouldn't matter to people, but the way Phil made it sound, it made me look like I was desperate and perverted, or that's the idea I got from it.  You see I really don't understand Phil most of the time... he speaks mostly caveman, but there is a hint on English in his speach.  Phil decides to wander again... this time not coming back for almost a half hour.  I saw this group of girls (why are they always in groups).  They waved, I kinda ignored them, knowing full well they wouldn't come by me, but I would have to go by them, risking losing my precious spot.  Again I'm left with this crap feeling in my gut because of regret.  When the show finally started, DJ Logic, a very good DJ, but not the best opened the act, mixing for about 30 minutes.  He used mostly hip hop and the musics energy wasn't quite as high as I was expecting, but when opening for John Mayer I guess you can't have too much energy :p.  Maroon5 came out next, playing for about an hour.  It was a good show and Phil made it even better cause the fool fell asleep... now honestly, who falls asleep at a concert?  The best part of that situation was how he argued with me about how great Maroon5 was because I'm not really that big of a fan, and he proceeds to fall asleep during their part of the show... what an idiot.  Finally at about 9:30, John Mayer and his group came out.  Opening the show with "Clarity", one of my favorite songs on his Heavier Things album.  He played alot of his hit songs, making the crowd go crazier then ever.  Everyone was singing to it, except for Phil who only went because of "all the ladies at the show".  After he decided that no one was gonna approach him, cause that's the only way he works with females, he decides the Dashboard concert is higher priority, so he LEAVES ME ALONE!  Now let me remind you... it's dark outside... I'm not about to approach anybody at night and try to spark up a conversation... it's just not gonna happen mainly cause I'll regret talking to them after I see them in the light... I'm the most conceded person when it comes to that sort of thing.  The show finally ended at about 11... now the task of finding Phil who tried telling me where he was on the phone, but his phone sucks ass cause it keeps cutting out.  Mix that with his very strange language that he speaks and you are looking for a disaster.  I told him to find me... I would be waiting by a vendors stand, easy to find for most people, but not Phil... he thought he would just wander, trying to find the booth because apparently after being down there more then 5 times this year, he can't remember where certain vendors are located... now that wouldn't seem to difficult to most people, but to Phil it's the hardest thing ever!  Finally he found me and we left, getting back to my car at quarter after 12.  Finally I got home at almost 1 o'clock, pissing off my mom for breaking my curfew... jesus... life is not fair!  Last night I went to my uncles/cousins house for a 4th of July party.  It wasn't too bad... I knew full well that I wasn't gonna be drinking.  I even turned down all the alcohol that my cousin, his friend's girlfriend, and a few other friends kept trying to sneak me.  I felt so proud... actually I was planning on drinking later that night, but someone ruined that for me... I'll tell you more about that later.  We had a pig roast... which was funny as hell watching a bunch of 20 some year olds disect, playing with the different body parts and such.  The food was extremely good... I really wish I coulda ate more, but I never eat as much as I used to.  About 9 o'clock, my cousin decided to launch off all of his fireworks because the rain had let up a little... now normally people have a few hundred dollars in fireworks... well that would be an insult to my cousin if people thought of his show like that.  He bought well over $1500 worth of mortars, which are always buy one get one free.  He ended up having a semi deliver all of them, over 600 lbs of explosives delivered to his door...  He had to sell a lot of the fireworks otherwise the show would have lasted forever.  He still had about $1000 worth of fireworks in the end.  Now instead of having one or two guys lighting off these fireworks, they had probably 8 setups of tubes to launch the mortars, each with 4 to 8 tubes per setup.  Now he had 5 guys running around, sticking mortans into the tubes. lighing up the knot and then running back to grab more... this show lasted almost 30 minutes, without any long pauses.  It was one hell of a show... almost better then the shows you see sponsored by huge organizations.  At about 11:30, I get a call from my mom, telling me I have to come home... it's pouring out side at this point, thundering and lightening, but I still have to come home even though my car is a block down the street.  I guess it's a good thing I didn't start to drink, otherwise that would have been extremely bad.  My uncle told me I should stay over, so I called my mom and of coarse, that is outta the question... I mean, she would rather have me drive home in the pouring rain just before midnight, down the back roads of ozaukee county.  If I would happen to hydroplane, I wouldn't be found until the morning after... but I guess it's worth risking your son's life because she is made at the world.  Obviously I got home safely... but I still was pissed that I had to leave... I was soaking wet, meaning my seat is wet... meaning my car could potentially start to stink extremely bad because it's gonna be muggy and the water is gonna make the fabric smell musty.  Jesus life is unfair.  This morning my mom and siblings went to the cedarburg parade, I stayed home because my mom has been extra pissy lately.  I will most likely stay away from her as long was possible this entire weekend... including tomorrow since it is my day off...  I hope to find someone to hang out with today and tomorrow, just to get me outta my house...

      Well I have been extremely busy lately and I kinda forgot about my blog (not like anyone reads it anyways :p). I'll update you on what has happened in the last month...  I organized two DDR events, both of which benifited different charities. Both failed to raise a significant amount of money and I'm kind of upset about that. I did one at a locat resturant which made all of $50 and one at our county fair which made all of $40... This doesn't sound too bad since it is DDR, but I gave away TWO Cobalt Flux pads totaling $700... OUCH!  I also went to the Dells 2 weeks ago... it was awsome... but i got sunburned. I had a good time, got to play some DDR and swim some... hotels around there have enourmous water parks now, kinda crazy.  I also visited my big brother (from big brothers/big sisters) who moved to VA a few years ago. He brought me to a few colleges that I was interested in. I went to GA Tech (best school ever) and VA Tech (Kinda felt like I was Harry Potter). Both are very good schools and I would gladdly go to either, but GA Tech is much better IMHO. I also got to play DDR in VA... that was fun... even had a small crown :D  I have been working on a website of mine almost none stop. DDR Tourney USA (http://ddrtourney.com) is dedicated to DDR Tournaments (what else :p). I have been working on stuff for that and it's kinda upsetting seeing people not use it... but then again, it's only 45 days old :D.  That's about all that has happened to me that is significant. I could tell you some more things, but who really cares about those tiny things in my life.
