      I seriously need to learn how to play the game of love better. Or I need to learn how to play hard to get. It seems that if I like someone, I'm honest about my feeling. But I guess guys don't like that. So from now on, I will not be calling any guys after we make out or any such thing. Chris hasn't called me in 2 days. I'm kind of upset about it. I just don't get it. He told me I was his dream girl. I swear that line was just to kiss me. But I told him that I wanted to date him because I feel like a slut just making out with him all the time. So I kind of have a feeling he isn't calling me is because he doesn't have any money to take me on a date so he's just avoiding the whole situation. He is making me so angry. Well, I'm moving on. I'm keeping my options open. I don't want to loose out on any good opportunites. Plus my cousin Hannah is coming tomorrow to stay with me for the whole long weekend. I'm so excited to see her. So I'll make myself busy so I won't hang out with Chris when he comes crawling back. I can play these games too!! I went to institute tonight and it was so good. I learn so much about the church and the scriptures when I go. I feel so good when I'm there. It's awesome. I need to make more mormon friends. I feel like I'm getting a lot, but there always room for more. I like living in Long Beach. It has been the best decision I have made in a long time. I'm happy here. Ok, talk to you later.

      Well, today is Sunday and I really should be getting ready for church but I feel like procrastinating. I'm actually hungry right now and should get some breakfast. Ok, well Chris called me on Friday but we couldn't hang out because we both had different plans, but he ended up coming over late at night and we ended up making out. It was really, really fun. I'm not sure how much I like him, but I like kissing him. So that should mean something, right? He's actually really cool and down to earth. He's kind of had a crazy life, but he turned out surprisingly normal. So, on Saturday, I went to Disneyland with Mandy because work got us free tickets, and I was so tired. Then I came home, took a nap, and then got ready for my date with Layne. He's a super nice guy, I don't think my type. But we had a crazy night together because all these crazy things started to happen. Anyways, it actually turned out to be really fun and we had a good time. I seriously doubt he'll ask me out again. I think I am too wild for him. Which is ok, because he needs someone better than me. He wants to live in Utah for goodness sake! Ok, I better get ready for church. Byee!

      I have been perfecting my new song I wrote and I played it for Thorey tonight and she said she really liked it. She told me I was really talented and stuff. It made me feel good about myself. Sometimes I just get so down on myself as a musician. I dunno, I just need to get better. After playing music, me, Thor and Isabel went out to dinner at some mexican restaurant on 2nd street. Isabel leaves tomorrow for NY for the rest of the summer. I'm going to miss her, but she'll have a lot of fun. I also bought a new shirt tonight for my date on Saturday. It's a super cool layered shirt. I look hot! Um, I thought Chris would call me tonight because he got home from mexico today, but maybe he is tired or something. Maybe he'll call me tomorrow. Maybe he doesn't like me? I dunno, but our last conversation was so good. I mean it was good for me, but I don't know about him. He's so mysterious, I just want to know more about him. I hope he calls me. But if not, I'll just keep going out on my dates with dorky boring guys. Ok, I need sleep. Later.

      I ate some bad food tonight and now I feel sick. I went with Matt and Jeff to some Irish Pub and had really horrible food. Irish food sucks. Anyway, it was fun hanging out with those guys. It's kind of refreshing, but then I don't think I could hang out with them all the time. I serisouly don't know what's up with my social life. Dating totally sucks. I have a date on Saturday with some guy I don't even know. He seems nice and all, but it's wierd to just go out with some person you have no interest in or have no idea what's he's about. But whatever, I'm just going to go and try to have fun. He seems like a total dork, but I just have to go once and I'll never have to go again. I'm trying to keep my options open because you never know who you'll like. But then again, I know I won't like him. I don't even think I'm attracted to him. So, my bad luck with guys will continue. But I feel like I learn a little about myself with each one. And since I did absolutly no dating while I was in college, it's now my time that I did. I'm so sick of talking about boys, but that's all I have to talk about. Ohhh, today I picked up my diploma. I got all sad and cried a little bit. It was offical that I'm done with college. It made me a little sad. I was just thinking about all the times I had and all of the memories, and it was all over. Geeze, it went by so fast. I can't believe it's over. In the moment, it seemed so slow, but now, wow. I'll be sad about it for awhile. Ok, talk to you later. Byee!

      So I wrote a new song tonight. I actually wrote the lyrics a while ago (like 6 months or so) and I have just been waiting to use them. I made up song catchy little tune and I think it's an okay song. I'm so proud of myself because write a new song was one of my goals and I have already accomplished it! I can scratch that off my list. So, why does money always make things so aweful?!! At work, they are trying to figure out some sort of bonus structure, and I never cared about a bonus before, but now it's getting me to think about money and I'm getting money hungry! It's totally sucks. I don't want to be like that. I just need to stop thinking about all the money I could potentially get and be happy with what I got. Because it's not like I'm going to stay with this job for the rest of my life. One of my goals is to be able to quit my job. Ahh, well, tomorrow I'm going to go out and socialize and try to meet some new people. Okay goodnite!

      So, I made my list of goals and it feels good to write them all down. I already feel better about myself and my life. If I accomplish everything on my goal list, I will be a happier person. Plus I will have to satisfaction of crossing things off a list, that's always fun!! My hip hurts today because I went for a run, when I haven't ran in a long time. I'm totally out of shape but one of goals is to loose weight, not that I'm fat or anything, I'm just not where I used to be and it's bugging me. I also played volleyball today at church today and it kind of scares me. I feel like I'm going to get hit in the head. That would suck to break my nose or something. Work is going okay. I guess I'm going to start getting some sort of bonus. Whatever, I don't even care. I have never gotten a bonus before, so I guess anything would be nice. It really doesn't matter to me. Well, I'm going to go to bed now, See ya.

      I went to church today and it was okay. It was testimony meeting and there are some crazy people at church. I didn't really get to meet anyone new, but I have an okay time anyway. I like my friends at church, they are all pretty cool. There is this one guy who is a friend, but he's way old, and I think he likes me or something because he keeps on trying to go out with me. I try to avoid it as much as possible. I like him as a church friend, but nothing else. Plus he has a reputation for being a womanizer. I'm not even attracted to him. Today we learned about setting goals, so I'm going to start making and tracking my goals. I have a few things in mind ... like paying off my credit cards, going to that music school in hollywood and eventually quitting my job. All good things. Even though it's only been 5 months since I graduated college, I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life. I feel like my life is so pointless right now. And since I'm doing nothing extra curricular, I focus all my attention on boys, even though I have never been boy crazy or anything. I think boys should be a priority, but not my only priority. I'm going to go make my list right now. See ya.

      Last night was the first time I saw him after we stopped hanging out with each other. It was wierd not to talk to him and spend time with him. I didn't realize that I was so used to hanging out with him, that when I didn't, it made me sad. I just need to get over it and move on. I know that he isn't the one for me, but it was nice to have someone for a little bit. I went to the movies today and saw Napolean Dynamite. It was awesome. Really funny. It's going to be the next cult movie. It reminded me of Wes Anderson movies. I felt like today was totally just flew by and I just kind of wasted it. I woke up late, went to the movies, hung out with my sisters, watched tv, rented a movie and didn't take a shower until 5:30. And I have felt tired all day. I feel more tired today waking up at 10 am, then I do when I wake up at 7am. I'm excited to go to church tomorrow, but then again I'm not. I want to go and feel the spirit and take the sacrament, but I just don't want to deal with everything that comes along with it. I dunno, I always feel like this, but then when I get there I feel better. Maybe I'll make a new friend. We'll I guess I'm going now. I feel tired and want to sleep.

      I'm 23 and living in Long Beach.  I graduated from college and now working a pretty much a dead end job. I only stay here because it pays my rent and my car payment. I'm just waiting around to see what I want to do with my life. But all in all, I'm happy. I do not have a boyfriend right now, which is okay, but I would like to get one. How does one get one? Well, I'm trying. I have been on so many dates, and nothing ever comes of them. Well, I just haven't met Mr. Right yet. I need someone creative and musicical. Someone that makes me laugh and challenges me. I think sometimes that I'm too picky, or I will not like someone for 1 bad trait. Maybe I need to evaluate my standards. I dunno - but, I have been in love (or maybe lust) and it's fun, but it sucks at the same time. This is all for now. I will write more later. Peace out.

      Tonight was fun. I went to the movies with Matt and we saw the Bourne Supremacy. It was good. Now I'm just relaxing and dreading another day of work. Working full time was good for awhile, but now it's starting to get to me. Everyday is so beautiful here and I'm stuck inside an office. I wish I had a little more freedom. Other than that, my life is okay. Saturday is Mandy's baby shower and I'm kind of in charge of it. I seriously don't have any money. I'm so broke. I'm going to have to so skimpy on her baby shower present. Oh well, I'm throwing the whole thing for her, so that should be her present. Ahh, I wish I made more money. I need to get a raise, or find a new job. I just want to get out of debt. If I didn't have to pay credit cards every month, I would be a rich lady. Credit cards are evil! But yet I still get them. I had my fun in the past, but now I have to pay them off. Well, I'm off to have some chocolate milk. Later.

      I have been thinking a lot about life lately. Mostly because my nephew goes into surgery next week and I'm a little scared. This will be his last surgery, thank goodness. We are just praying that everything will go well and he will be healthy. My sister in law and brother have been through so much, and especially little Owen, he doesn't even know what's going on. My heart is just so heavy. I can't wait until it's all over with and everything is fine. I'm going to their house tomorrow to pick up Sam and spend the day with him. I haven't seen him since Thorey's wedding. I miss my family. I guess I'm just lonely right now. I'm just thankful for all of my family and how much love they give me. I know that if I follow and keep the commandments I will be fine. Sometimes I just go through some panic attacks, like I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and it scares me. It's like, college is the only thing I thought about for a long time, and now that it's over, I don't know what to do. I actually have a lot of options, but I don't know which road to take. The 1st counselor in the bishopric told me that I should consider a mission. I told him that I was too old for one, and he said I wasn't. I still could go if I wanted. I don't know. Now I'm thinking I want to go on one. Or do I just want to escape reality? I'm really confused. The only way I could go on a mission is if I paid off all of my debts. I have a lot, so it might take me a while. I seriously embrace change, I hate for things to stay the same. I hate my life to stay the same. I want to be doing something different all of the time. Or I just need some more life experiences. College gave me some, but not enough. I think praying and reading my scriptures for revelation is the only way I'm going to figure things out. I have faith that Heavenly Father will provide my way. Ok, bedtime. Goodnite.

      Tonight I went to see my friend Matt's musical he play percussion in.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; The musical was really entertaining.&nbsp; Matt is super talented.&nbsp; He will be famous one day.&nbsp; I seriously need to start excersizing more!&nbsp; I'm getting really fat and it's depressing.&nbsp; I thought that working full time would make me loose weight, but it's the exact opposite.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; That's it! I'm loosing weight.&nbsp; I went off my budget a little bit.&nbsp; I love tracking all of my expenses.&nbsp; It's really interesting to see where all of my money goes.&nbsp; It's just like a business, you have to track where your money goes to save money.&nbsp; It makes sense.&nbsp; So, I have no dates for this weekend, nothing fun to do.&nbsp; I'll probably just hang around and do nothing.&nbsp; I wish I liked someone.&nbsp; Blah, blah blah. Ok, bedtime. goodnite.

      Today was good.&nbsp; I just went to work and after I tried to exercise but I pulled a mussle in my back.&nbsp; It hurts really bad.&nbsp; Then I went to FHE and it was okay.&nbsp; It so depressing when you don't like anyone.&nbsp; I feel kind of lonely right now.&nbsp; I hate it when I feel loney because I do stupid things like call guys that don't like me and look pathetic.&nbsp; Well, I'm not going to do it.&nbsp; I'm going to be tough and not call anyone.&nbsp; I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I want to get a boyfriend.&nbsp; I'm so sick of first dates and all that stuff, I'm ready for a relationship.&nbsp; I just don't know how to get one.&nbsp; Plus there isn't anyone I like good enough to start one with.&nbsp; I just need to wait it out and it will happen for me.&nbsp; I'm trying to get my life in order.&nbsp; Today I made a budget to track all of my expenses.&nbsp; I'm going to be way more careful with money.&nbsp; I'm going to start by always paying my tithing.&nbsp; I haven't in a long time and I need to start.&nbsp; It's a commandment I need to keep.&nbsp; This week is going to suck because we are traveling doing billing.&nbsp; I just hate it so much.&nbsp; But I need to keep a positive attitute because if I don't, I'll end up hating my job.&nbsp; Ok, well, I guess that's enough.&nbsp; Bye!

      I am feeling better, not 100% back to normal, but better. I slept a lot this weekend. I didn't end of up going to traffic school today because I was too tired.&nbsp; I stayed out with some friends last night way too late, and being sick and all, it took it's toll on my body.&nbsp; So, I'm going to have to reschedule.&nbsp; Tomorrow I'm not going to church because I have threate tickets.&nbsp; I really don't like going to the theatre on Sunday, but my grandma loves for me to go, so I really don't have a choice.&nbsp; I really don't get to see her that much, so it's good quality time together.&nbsp; It's sooo hot right now I think I'm going to pass out of heat exgaustion. Seriously, I need to buy a fan, but I'm too poor. On Tuesday I'm buying a fan!!&nbsp; I'm sweating to death. So, what else, I kind of just speant the whole day by myself. Tonight Suz made dinner and we just stayed in and watched movies. It was nice.&nbsp; We really didn't have a choice because we are so poor. Ok, I need to go to bed. I'm going to pass out! Goodnite.

      I'm getting over my cold quite well. Now it's all in my nose and sinus, so I just can't breath. Which sucks because I can really only breath from one side of my nose anyway. I was so tired today because last night Suz and I stayed up until 2 in the morning talking to our friend Brian. It was really good talking to him, but we stayed up way too late. Today at work I was hurtin' so bad. So I came home and instead of going to enrichment night, I fell asleep. I should have gone to enrichment, it would have been fun. Bummer. I just couldn't get myself out of bed.&nbsp; I officially have no plans for this weekend. Suz is going to Palm Springs tomorrow and I want to go but I have traffic school all day on Saturday.&nbsp; I hate traffic school! It's my second time going. I don't ever want to get a ticket ever again! I am so poor right now. I only have like 50 bucks in my checking account. How did I get so poor? I feel like I don't make enough money, so much to the point where I want to get a second job.&nbsp; I don't know what else to do. I need a raise. I'm never going to get one. I need to quit my job and do something else, but that's not going to happen either. Well, I'm getting really fat. I haven't excercized is a long time, and it shows. As soon as I get over my cold, I'm going to start working out again. It's totally getting way out of control! Ok, well I better go to bed now. Goodnite.

      Well I'm officially sick. I went to the doctor today and he put me on antibiotics. Which is good because I need to get better. I hate being sick. I had to cancel my date with Chris tonight to go to the Pagant of the Masters, which I really wanted to go to because it would be cool, but I'm too sick and contagious! Hopefully by this weekend I will be okay. I have traffic school on Saturday and really not looking forward to it. Today I bought a new computer workstation. It fits my apartment so much better and it's really cute. Now I need to buy a entertainment center and a new tv, then I will be complete. I can't believe how much I have been sleeping since I have been sick. It seems all I do is sleep. Which is nice because I love sleeping. I don't have any plans for this weekend really. I have theatre tickets on Sunday, so I won't be able to go to church. But I'm still going to hang out with my friends afterwards. Ohhh, geeze, it's been so hot lately. I need to go buy a little fan because it's totally miserable. I hate not having air conditioning. Ohh, wait, I won't be complete just with an entertainment center! I still need to buy a little kitchen table. Just a little two seater table. Then my apartment will be complete. Ahh, I can't wait. I just need more money! Ok, I'm going to go get ready for bed. I'm already feeling better :)

      Having Hannah here was so refreshing. It was good just to relax and hang out and have fun. We did a lot of fun stuff together, but mostly we just loved being in each others company. I wish we lived closer and could hang out all of the time. I often think about living close to my cousins and having that sort of relationship with them and how it would go. I bet I would just love it. I'm trying to convince Hannah to go to grad school down here next year, so that way we could live together. That would be so much fun. Well, Chris eventually called me, but I'm so over it. I talked to him a couple of times, but he's so shady and I have no clue on what he thinks about. I had a date on Friday with some other guy named Chris and he is totally nice. But I don't know if I totally like him. He's a little bit shorter than me, and I don't know if he's my type. It really doesn't matter though because he's moving to Utah at the end of the month anyway. Which puts less pressure on me. Then Mike from Huntington Beach called me Friday to go out with me. When it rain, it pours. He is a totally cool guy too, and I could actually see myself liking him, maybe. I dunno. I should give him another try. He has his life together, which is better than the other guys I've been going out with. Enough with my love life, I'm so poor right now. I wish I made more money. I thought living on my own I would have more money, but I was wrong. I need to get my finances in order. There are so many things I need to do. Geeze. Okay, I better go to bed. Later.
