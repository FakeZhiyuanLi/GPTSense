       mmmmm, dennys is damn good, especially at 1 in the morning. went to dennys with redneck cait and john just a little bit ago, and later today im going four wheeling in rednecks new bronco so that will be kinky. planned a little bit more for the road trip with the homies. we picked up a few more people to go with us so thats nifty. the more the merrier. the more fun we have. strip poker will be interesting along with 3-man. nothing like camping with a group of homies when you and two others are insomniacs. ha, i feel sorry for the poor sap who goes down first. mmmmm steak is good. i want some steak now. oooo music is on. i like music also. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. turtle wax shines like peanut in sun for eight days. Note to everyone: do not get a job at mcdonalds. i worked there for over a year and couldnt take it anymore. it was horrid. oh but one thing to their credit, they keep the grill area and food storage areas really clean, i worked in grill and did truck deliveries amung everything else in the store. humpf, i need my knife back from carrie. too many things to cut, too little ammount of knives to choose from. i only have like 4 knives now. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. all work and no play makes crial a dull boy. sorry i needed a tribute to one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kurbrik's The Shinning, that and his version of A Clockwork Orange. two great movies. wyane brought cody over today. that dog is awesome, a little brown and white brittney. fun to wrestle with and a good hunting dog. oh yea speaking of hunting, we were hunting the durned rabbits that run around my house today. redneck hucked one of my knives at the only one we found and skimmed its ears and stuck into the ground behind it. so were were about &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  to havging some good ol' rabbit for dinner. good stuff that rabbit, hassenfeffer, or something in german. i cant remember quite how its spelled but its quite good. ok well solitaire is calling me so im ditching you people, if anyone actually reads this stuff.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Crial is playing solitaire and you cant stop him.    &nbsp;

       well, i think ive lost the ability to sleep longer than 2 hours a night...well morning or afternoon you could say. i dont sleep much anymore. the earliest i have gone to sleep in the past few weeks has been 6:30am and there was a point in there where i was up for 72 hours straight. kinda odd but who cares, ive lost 20 pounds last time i checked which was about 2 weeks ago i wanna so. heh i might have lost more so ha. yawn......yea i wish 2:45ish right now, idk what i have my blog clock set to, maybe some time in europe. hmmmm i ate some peanuts today, i think that was it. me homies cam by today again, they are here every day. carrie, cait, and redneck are the usual ones, but every once in a while jess jess, dale, vicki and dano treat me with their company. well tonight the regulars and i decided we going on a road trip in aug. its kinda cool that even though im up for so long at a time ya think i would run out of things to do, but i guess either im creative or ive been procrastinating a whole bunch of stuff. eh, either way oh well. oh yea i had accidently cut my hands the other night, though carrie and cait think otherwise. it wasnt as bad as it looked considering my hands were covered in blood and it was dripping on the walkway up to my front door. i was too lazy to get up&nbsp;to wash&nbsp;it off&nbsp;or stop the bleeding at all, but carrie took me inside and cleaned me up. i had just got my knife back from her that night too, and&nbsp;now its back with her and&nbsp;still with her. i finally shaved, i hadnt since school let out, i was starting to look like some kind of hairy beast...but not big foot.....something along the lines of someone who hadnt chaved in a while. pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle pickle. aint nothing but a hound dog. well boredom is setting in again. who is online now.....why do i still have kolins screen name....oh well. ok who else, little jimmy, dave...dave again, someone who i forgot, and the X..........maybe ill talk to jim again. he might be going with the homies on our road trip deelee. "for keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl with: B = Bold, I = Italic, S = Publish, D = Draft" hmmmm no. there is nothing better than playing with fire i think. its so fun. oil, lighter fluid, gas, cloth, rope, matches, piping, flouor, DAP contact cement, chain, STUPID AOL PORN INSTANT MESSAGES!!!!!!, duct tape, people's clothes&nbsp;you hate who left their clothes at your house, video camera, and a coffee can. how can you go wrong with that? oh yea i forgot one thing. lawn chairs and drinkage. need somewhere to sit and something to drink cuz gas taste like bad. boy howdy this trip with the homies is gonna be fun. oh yea, ren fair is saturday! kinky. hopefully i can snag my hat and vest and maybe my aunt can buy me that other thingy.......oooo nice.......yea im taking some homies to the ren fair too. vicki jim mary jimmys mommy tom wayne, if cait and/or carrie have no work or what not, and pretty much anyone else who i can stand spending the day around. oh yea, i almost forgot about shatnerball. thats gonna be a blast, haha blast that funny. 3 days of paintball with Tom Kaye owner and founder of Airgun Designs, Mancow from WKQX, Willy Shatner mostly known&nbsp;for playing&nbsp;Cpt. Kirk on Star Trek. its gonna be real fun, Long Live Don Kaye. ill get to try out my new equip there and see how it works. then its off to purchase a few more things/gun(s). ok well your starting to bore me so im gonna go watch fellowship of the ring, two towers, and return of the king........thats about 11 hours cuz i have special editions!!! ok well to make food and watch the movies.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Crial Has Spoken and You Have Listened, Suprised?

      who actually reads these things? if someone puts their little thingys up on the internet someone is bound to read it. but who? and why? are they so interested in the other persons life? if they are just call the damn person and ask them some questions to get to know them better, dont act like a loser waiting for them to say something about it on their online thing. what the hell is this this anyway? why am i even typing on it? oh yea, im bored out of my mind again. and just woke up from finally getting to sleep at like 11AM. a good hour and a half sleep. good enough for me. hmmmm a stapler........well that didnt go too well. now i have 7 staples in my arm. ok time to get rid of that. nothing else bothers me but nothing. nothing bothers me more than anything. nothing is calm and quiet and good. colors on a windmill, letters on a notepad, oil on the street, water in the gutter, roadkill on my lawn. bang!

      yawn, its hot in here, BANG. im bored. life is good. events are interesting, paintball in 6 days. i got my full setup now, its BING. all my stuff is sitting in my room like BOOM. ill be on the field balls flying past and hitting people and their guns, SWOOSH POP DINK. elvis is dead. sodium nitrate and yellow 5 conjurate a nifty treat, goes well with toast. the homies should be using their device of voice projection soon enough to communicate with me and devise up a game plan on the days happenings. i fell down a flight of stairs the other day. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm, the entire alphabet......stupid keyboard, why cant it just be in proper order. there is nothing better than 20 feet of red string wrapped around a telephone pole. why wont my warp work, it spins but stops...rather annoying. what is a hot dog made out of? i need to sharpen my scissors and draw a picture. maybe a day of fishing will help my complexion. i still believe in horseshoes. what could change the way the earth rotates better than a magnet and a pair of pliers? teddy bear, jumper cables, toothpick, 16 pennies, a 4 once weight, half cup of flour, and a blade of grass. i remember the day the apples began to fight back. the wreched things, killing everything the touched. sometimes i wish i had never eaten the apple from that tree. be careful, dont feed the animals, their emotions might bend their wits and break their wills causing a major cerebural backfire. you never know what will happen next, dont change the channel, its just starting to get fun. i esu a etarc pma rof ym zenabi ssab. (17 + 54) / 13 * 8.34 + .46 / 23 + 17 = 19 and there is nothing you can do to change that now is there. behold the glorious keeper of the velvet antelope.    Crial has Spoken

       what is the difference between a drawing of a tree and a drawing of a piece of cheese. well, one would say the drawing of the cheese would be some sort of orange or yellow and the tree being brown red green orange yellow silver and what not, but i say nothing is different about either. they are both drawings. i need something, but im not sure what it is. can someone help me? doubtful, your all there just sitting on your chair reading this. your probally reading this because your life is worse than mine and you feel you need an escape by picturing you in someone elses life. you arr a loser. lets see, what is worth caring for in life........? hmmmmm i dont know, i cant really think of anything. what is worth caring for. friends....no they never stay. family....they die off....work.....you lose it and live on the streets.....possessions.....they either break or get lost or burnt or destroyed in some way....there is really nothing to care for in life. oh wait, yourself maybe. no, cant say that. if you care for yourself then you wont have fun in life. if you dont care for yourself you just do things without thinking and have a great time. ever wish someone would get into a car accident in front of you so you can see the bodies as they fly through the windshield and hit an oncoming car. thinking about that bring a smile to my face for some reason. hmmm, now i want to go sit out at some high accident rate intersection or something for a day and just wait with a camera. that would be fun to do. either that or just throw small animals into a high traffic area and let the camera roll. i dont know, am i a sick person. i dont think so, im just misunderstood hahahahaha. well, either way i just dont care about you people or what you think about me because its going to be you flying through that windshield into the other car, and im going to get it all on tape. have a pleasent evening morning or afternoon, because its coming soon, and ill be waiting.

       tiny font tiny font tiny font.......not very tiny..........eh whatever. well after seven glorious years of playing paintball for rec, my team is going competition and scenario. but we have one problem....no durnned name. so if any of you wonderful people on the other side wish to lend a hand i will send $1 us unmarked to the winner of the competition. you pay shipping and handling of $51 us UNMARKED to me. idk how long this little input i have will be but lets see shall we. today i ate something, i forgot what it was considering my current state of consumption of liquids. well then, i went to the zoo but i wasnt let in, they wouldnt let me in. its not like i was gonna do something stupid or was i........O_o......ok then. taco taco taco taco + chicken = fairly large roaming charges on your phone bill. retry, create, fall over and roll down stairs. what did i do today, i talked to people online. i talked to these people and they wouldnt believe me. i mean with. eh oh well nothing i can do. hehehe i threw white castle burgers at this one kid last night, i hit him in the head and laughed. i couldnt stop laughing, i dont know what came over me. its sad how disgusting people in this world have gotten. i cant stand looking at most of them. the grotesque state of living some of these people have just gives me the chills, and what horrible people they are on the inside. i thought i was bad, but ive found many worse, many i consider friends, and many who are no longer a friend. such disturbing mannerism has taken over this world and it truly sickens me to the point of vomiting on every person i see. i dont know, i think i am the only one who sees it. the rest of the people are all blind to the reality of what is standing right next to them. you look to your right and you see a murderer, you look to your left and you see a man who beats his wife every night, and standing right in front of you through the mirror you see someone so ignorant to it all that they should just go away and rid this world of one obscenity. just talking about this makes me sick. im done before i puke.
