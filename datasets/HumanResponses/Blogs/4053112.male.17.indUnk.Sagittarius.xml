      I am out of the hole and back to even, maybe a little up actually after booking a solid night of $100+.  I got really lucky in a $30+3 SnG picking up AA 4x, but I finished 2nd anyhows.  Tommorow will hopefully be another winning day.

      I get a free ride this time, I got a $50 Bonus for the tell-a-friend promotion, so my bankroll is back up and running, couldn't have asked for anything better....thanks a lot rich.  Look for me and rckinc, we are taking over the online poker world.  Off to the NO LIMT TABLES.

      The Main event premiered today...some knockouts were: MoneyMaker, Farha, and John Juada.  One exciting hand was when some guy picked up bullets and made it 1200 to Jesus.  Jesus flopped top pair, was put all in and called, and he ended up catching trips on the river...just goes to show even the pros get lucky too.  A lot of pros got caught bluffing and it really makes me think about how the game is evolving...bluffing is not an easy thing to do anymore, online or in real life vs. loose players.  It is more profitable to only play the nuts, or nut draws, and attempt to bluff later on.

      My bankroll was cleaned out yesterday when my QQ (hilton sisters) went down to KK.  So at -$100 I have to start buiding up again.  Things I will remember next time are:  1.  Play at the game you have most success at...If you are losing at lot at one type of game, quit and and try another.  This has been written a lot and is considered common poker knowledge, but in the heat of battle sometimes your mind is too focused to remember all the poker teaching you have read.  It is definitely easy to talk yourself into thinking you are just hitting a bad run of cards, which may be true, but one thing can lead to another easily...believe me....  2.  When you bankroll is getting low, play the game that is most likely to boost your bankroll up with minimal risk.  I tried to play low limit poker when my bankroll got low, but a bad run of cards can ruin you here.

      I lost $250 last night playing on the $1/2 bad beat jackpot tables...what a ridiculous bad run of cards.  My bankroll is holding on though at $150 and I'm currently in a $30+3 NO limit tourney where I cracked aces with my queens.  Anyway I should be getting back to the tourney now.

      I hosted a buy-in tonight at my house and got a turn out of 5 not including myself:  Seat 1:Cakes Seat 2:Chanda Seat 3:Marcus Seat 4:Kaplan Seat 5:Hurt  We played dealer choice for about 3 hours and I ended up about $5. I made about 2 succesfull bluffs for big pots. Yay!!! I also played my  friend Kaplan heads up 2x, splitting. In the second match, I bluffed all-in before the flop with garbage, which I WILL NEVER DO AGAIN...lol. The online bankroll is at $360, and I managed to lose 4 SnG's yesterday, including to $20+2's. I plan to play some ring games and maybe a tourney tonight.    Ita erat quando hic adveni, latin for  "it was that way when i got here"

      I turned in another positive night yesterday, gaining another $50.  A few crazy things have happened these past days, and the lack of sleep has probably cost me a few pots.  Quad aces have helped a coulple of times, once in hold'em and once in stud.  In the stud game, I acutally picked them up after I had AKKAJ10X beat by J910108Q(runner, runner strait).  I folded J10 suited yesterday UTG, and it woulda been a straight flush!!!  Then the very next hand I my stud table I threw away Queens only to see my trips woulda fell, oh well.   These events are in past, and although they are a little out of the ordinary, they didn't affect my play.  Hopefully, the good play will continue.     fortuna suffragante

      My eyes hurt and its hard to keep them open I've been playing so much on Party these past few days. It's worth it though, and I've found some luck in the stud and no limit tables. the no limit tables require an insane amount of discipline to win at, any one mistake has the potential to put you bankrupt. Also, the bad beats can send you pacing around wondering how you could have lost, but in the end, you have to keep a cool head about everything.  I banked about another $60 in profit this morning and will probably try some tounreys.    carpe diem

      I played some stud, stud h/l, and nl $25 last night and came out with profit in 2/3. I finished somewhere around +50. It should have been a little more but I got sucked out by a Q8o preflop caller of $10, and he caught his second 8 on the river after calling my all in preflop with mid pair of 8's. These type of players online will eventually lose their entire bankroll. The thing you have to keep in mind is that there are thousands of these suckers, and they are the players you will win the most off in the long run. One bad beat here or there should be viewed as a good thing, keeping the sucker in the game. One strategy to use vs. these players is to just play tight and aggressive and only play after the flop with the nuts or a draw to the nuts. These types of players will play almost all hands preflop, most hands preflop in the face of a preflop raise, and all or any flop that they have a caught the smallest piece off. It is also important to have discipline vs. these types of players during the hand...Never underestimate your enemy, as weak as they may be.    neutiquam erro

      I played in 3 SnG's(Sit &amp; Go's) tonight, getting knocked out on the bubble in the first $20+2, winning the next $20+2, and getting knocked out on the first hand of my last $10+1: Aces vs. Kings, and like Robert Varkonyi says, "the Aces usually win". So overall I am up $48 on the night, and am going to bed.     ad extremum
