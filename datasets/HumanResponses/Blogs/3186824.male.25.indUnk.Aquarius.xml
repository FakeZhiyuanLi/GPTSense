       Ahoy again..   i added more artwork to my page, so go and behold says i . hmm besides that, today was just another day in the MooCave.. and oy i did something funky to my back i think, i get this uber sharp pain if i twist too much, breathe real deep or sneeze. The old people prolly put an evil juju curse on me, and now im starting to become one of them!......  it could happen !    Ok anyway, I stopped at home for a little bit tonight to visit my parents and my lil bro and it happened again!.. my mom can never let me leave without giving me heaps of food. why? i do not know... she acts like i live in Somalia or something.  Maybe when ( if ) i become a parent ill understand.   Ive been getting  alot  of sad messages from my EverQuest friends lately, me saying " im not coming back " hits them as if i said " Im terminally ill "  its crazy.  Im still here guys and im still going to be around online! lol sheesh..

       GAWD its good to be home! I am convinced that everyday is " Dont-Brush-Your-Teeth-Day " in SunCity, its disgusting, On a lighter note my old friend Sarah stopped by my work for a bit, its been quite awhile since ive seen her and shes just as jolly i remember, the kind of person whos smile seems unbreakable. :)  She came to drop off a novel by Brian Jaques ( i hope i spelled that right ) she thinks ill like it lots, so ill give it a go.  My fav will always be  Clive Barker  though, cause no one can twist fantasy horror and perversion like he can! mwahaha!     I have started scanning drawings from my sketchbook and adding them to an online portfolio-  http://azraiel.deviantart.com/   I have so many drawings, check back often, i will be adding more eventually.    Art is my life, Drawing, Inking, Painting, PCpen, you name it, i do it, and i love it.  I  really doubt anything will ever come of it though, most of my art is pretty scary, gross, dark, odd, ect..  haha so yeah... i dunno, check it out...

       Today at work, the most magical thing happened.  The queen of the abyss ( my boss ) asked me if i would like to go home and have the day off..........   it was like a dream, too good to be true.......  Was this a trick question? Am i really in trouble? Am i going to have to work extra on saturday? Do i owe some kind of sexual favor now? Whatever the reason, i couldnt turn my back on such rare freedom. Away i go! hahaha!

       Summer is coming and its coming fast, for most this is a time of joy.. but for me.. well.. not really, in Arizona it gets to be over 100 degrees, last summer i think we topped at like  116 . Walking outside is a bit like sticking your face into a bag of popcorn fresh from the microwave.   The cool thing is, i have my own place, so i can set the AC to " Arctic Storm ", run around in boxers and live on cherry freezer pops  and no one complains !   I really need to move to Flagstaff.... * sigh *

       I have decided tonight that all we really need in this life to be happy is-  1.) good friends 2.) a pool table 3.) and purple hooters    um... Im not quite sure whats  IN  a purple hooter exactly but they were only a buck a shot and wow they sure get your head spinning! haha.

       There was a lil bug in my apartment tonight, but he wasnt helping with rent so he had to go.. damn freeloaders, okay anyway...  I had no work and no errands and it was so great! I ate a cheeseburger today that was SO good and SO mighty it coulda stopped the heart of an elephant.. Played videogames for so long that im seeing gunfire flashes when i close my eyes..  Played music so loud that my whole building prolly knows ALL the lyrics to Stabbing Westward's Darkest Days..  And to top it all off,  played D&D and ate cheetos into the wee hours of the night..    Yeah yeah.. D&D is the highest form of nerdism... haha but damn its fun!!

       Hmm well hello world,  First things first!..  im an awful speller ... having said that, here we go...   i keep seeing these army commercials on TV that ask " if your life was a book, would anyone wanna ready it? " im not sure.. but i guess im gonna find out right now!   Here is the basics, my names Nick, im 25, i live in Arizona and i work in the dairy department (The MooCave) of a grocery store,  and its in the middle of SunCity of all places! (SunCity is a retirement town) its basicly a slice of hell here on earth.    I escaped a 2 year relationship gone sour awhile back and oddly enough, ive pretty much landed right back into another one, ha! but im happy with it, this one i have a ton more faith in, her names Cheryl and shes amazing.. i should have been with her all along but im a goof.. so yeah.   I have also just broke free of my EverQuest addiction, for those who dont know, its a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game... yeah yeah laugh it up, i know some of you out there know what im talking about!   Anywho my microwave is calling, thats all you people get for now!   PS-  someday im going to hurl my dial-up modem off my balcony... or just take a hammer to it, im undecided......

       The most wonderful thing just happened!... I walked in the door, and yes that is wonderful because work is the devil. I would have been home sooner but I decided to hit the McDonalds drive-through for a spicy chicken sandwich, what a mistake that was.. The guy ahead of me took  FOREVER  and I couldnt back out cause another car pinned me in. For a good 15 minutes this goober sat in his car going- " well.. hmm.. uh.. Well.. Um.. hmm.. " Whats to decide!? McDonalds has had the same menu since the dawn of time! 15 minutes! lol sheesh.. Sorry, im ok now.. Just felt like venting.   In other news, The guy I ordered from e-mailed me tonight! He says my CD is packed and incoming. I did another scribble and added it to my artpage. I reserved my hotel room in Wisconsin and I spent a bit more than I was aiming for. Cheryl drove out to the place I was planning on staying at and she didnt like it at all! If fact as she was describing it.. I couldnt help thinking " Bates Motel " and thats just not cool, so yeah, the more expensive one it is. lol.     Thats all for tonight gang, my Spider sense is tingling..    Are you stalking me? Cause that would be super.. ~Van Wilder

My friend Scott is all excited and was talking about the drive there, he cracks me up, check this out...    Azmordius:  should I bring CDs?  SHADOW6214:  yeah, the trip will prolly be 6-7 hours long..... If Brenton drives it will take 7 hours, if you or me drive it will take maybe 5, if Justin drives it will prolly be 3 hours..... If we live through it.  Azmordius:  HAHAHAH! Ill go with door #3.    Speaking of CDs.. I gave in and ordered a CD tonight from Amazon! " Nine Inch Nails  -  Pretty Hate Machine "  Bonus!  I been looking all over town for the damn thang and it turns out that its out of print! Zounds!.. But the guy I bought it from says its still in its original package so woo!  bonus again!  I really hope this all goes smoothly, I dont like ordering things online, makes me nervous.. Hmm only time will tell.. * crosses fingers *    Yanno' what else?...

       Well hello hello. I decided to call in sick today because we all need a personal holiday now and then! I visited my lil bro who just returned from his California vacation.. He picked me up the coolest Simpsons T-shirt! Woo!   Also today I got to see ' The day after tomorrow ' It was really good, the visual effects were just jaw dropping! See it! And see ' Shrek2 ' also, I think it was just as good as the first.  I just started reading my friend Sarah's Brian Jacques book, Its called " The Bellmaker " and so far its been pretty interesting.  Try to imagine talking woodland creatures in a medieval type setting.. Haha yeah its not quite what im used to, but hey, cant hurt to try.    My meatball sub is calling! Take care folks!   Your a long way from New York Constable... ~Sleepy Hollow

       I hate mornings, with such passion I do. Im a total night owl, Even when I try to goto bed early I just lay there, wide eyed, tossing and turning. Bleh, same crap tomorrow too.. But then I can go back to my wonderful nights! I cant wait.  Walking through the parking lot I came across sixty dollars, neat huh? Three twenty dollar bills justa' blowing along. I was a couple minutes late coming in because I walked around the lot trying to find more, haha.  I think im going to just add that money to my savings envelope, I have a feeling the bill for my hotel stay in Wisconsin is going to cost more than the plane ticket.    I think I should cut this one short, I told some friends I would meet them for dinner.. So away I go.. Have a good night people!    All your mental armor drags me down Nothing hurts like your mouth ~Bush

       Hey Gang, Its been a funky night.. My hun is bumming pretty bad. Its because she has so much to get done before she can fly away to Arizona.. Ugh, I hate feeling helpless..   I finished up another drawing tonight and colored it but I dunno.. I kinda liked it more being black and white.. Not that it looks awful now, just not what I had in mind. Take a look at my page and see for yourself, Its called " Abaddon ". Plus I love getting feedback. :)  http://azraiel.deviantart.com/   When I wake up it will be payday, but it is also rent week.. Meaning I get money then I hand it back.  Hmmm well I have been getting alot of hours lately so maybe it wont be thaaat drastic.. I dunno.. We shall see. Crash time for the Nick!   She called me a noble steed!.. ~Shrek

        I think I was having a creative spurt today or something! Cause I bammed out 3 new pictures! Janci's Angel, Erica's Faerie and one wicked Nosferatu.. I just want to color them now before I do any scanning. It shall be soon says I!     Also today I spoke to my ex Brittany for the first time in quite awhile. It was good to hear shes doing well, she has a new man now and it sounds like shes really getting her new life moving. I Hope things keep getting better for her.   When I wake up I should go get my shot.. I keep putting it off, and thats prolly not good. Then I should get a haircut, just to thin it out alil, they better not mess up the length! They like to do that...   I know I keep mentioning this " shot " thing and I havnt explained it, so here it goes- Every other week I have to get a shot because I am not aging properly, tis why im 25 but look 19... Tho this doesnt SOUND like a bad condition to have, it can be bad farther down the road as internal parts of me are underdeveloped.. Mainly my heart.  All has been going great the last couple years though, so great that I may be able to move to a patch soon, then eventually, nothing at all!   WOOT! I think thats all for tonight kids, play more Xbox and eat more popcorn!   I will look for you on the field... ~The Last Samurai

      I got a steak thrown at me today..  How bout that? A semi-frozen, packaged steak.. All because this woman didnt use her discount card at the self-checkout register and paid full price for it.  SELF-CHECKOUT  means you take care of your own damn order, no one is going to hold your hand, all you have to do is pay attention to the computer.. * sigh *  I would have given her a refund, no big deal but nope, she had a fit, threw the thing and stormed out. Lets just add this to the list shall we?    The Shit-thrown-at-Nick-over-the-years List.   1.  a baby bottle  2.  a can of tomato sauce  3.  some car keys  4.  a carton of cigarettes  5.  wadded up dollar bills  6.  a steak   Good thing this June brings a small vacation, I need an escape. mmm escape.. So good..  Thats all for now, I need more cashews.   Its good Its guuuuuuuuuuud ~Jim Carrey

       Howdy gang.  As usual, work today was a great and mighty mass of suckage!  But afterwards I stopped at my parents house. I got to hang around with the family and abuncha my brothers pals. We ate spicy polish sausage things and then my dad busted out the " magic car wax ",  some foul smelling stuff called Yzmol.  My lil bro gave me an old shirt to wear so I wouldnt mess up my work shirt during the action... It was half blue and half stained with what looked like ketchup and it was so tight you could see my ninnies!.. yeah yeah real funny,  =)  Haha anyway my car is all uber shiny and snazzy now! woot.  In other news, it looks like camping might be taking the place of the Vegas trip.. We will see..  Stay tuned!  * cue dramatic drum beat *     We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze. Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway. But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog. The fickle fascination of an everlasting god. You know I'm not dead! ~Smashing Pumpkins

      Here I am! Yeah yall know ya missed me.....  yanno whats nuts!? I read an article that Andy Kauffman ( sp? ) is alive! The crazy goober faked his death for 20 years just to secure his place as the greatest comic prankster ever. The wildest thing about it is that he even kept his own family in the dark! What could you possibly say to your family after doing something like that? " Hi mom, Im home.. I was just kidding.."   Its just insane to me..  Today was so.. Eh, I didnt get done anything I needed to, I just slept in way too late * stares at Cheryl accusingly * hahaha JK hun.  It was a total slack day! I worked on more pictures, went out gaming with the guys, Cheated and ate more than I should have, I should run extra tomorrow for that. hmm.  Tomorrow its back to the salt mines.. Maybe ill stop at home after work, my dad is obsessed with putting this "special wax" on my car.. haha dont ask, I dunno jack about car care..  Oh well, the pillow calls and I must answer, Ta'   I got my head, but my head is unraveling  Can't keep control, can't keep track of where it's traveling  I got my heart but my heart is no good  And you're the only one that's understood ~NIN

Speaking of art, im finally getting around to my drawing requests, I finished my friend Sarah's sexy witch tonight. Go Look!    http://azraiel.deviantart.com/      Next up, my friend Janci's Angel! dun dun dunnnn!  Tomorrow is errand / gameday, im not so sure about gaming tho, there are so many movies to be seen!

        " 3 Doors Down " is playing here tonight!! And im not there.... For the last couple days I have been calling the radio station ( TheZone ) To win tickets and I never even got through! Not once! Jerks, There has got to be a better way..   UGH! And then! I got another damn call for Emilio Martin, this time at 7am! I have been living here for over a year now and this girl still calls for this Emilio guy! Does she not believe me when I say " He doesn't live here "? I think the next time it happens I should be like- " Hello, yes this is Emilio. I hate you, ive always hated you, dont ever call me again."   Bwahahahahahah!.. JK.. Thats alil too evil..  ooh ooh ooh my popcorn is done! Later folks!   Awwwwww no tears please.. Tis a waste of good suffering! ~PinHead

      Ahoy! Guess what I got!.. Guess.. Guess.. Guessed?.... I got  A PIRATE FLAG ! Thats right ladies and gentlemen, A good ole black and white skull with crossed bones, And its no wussy flag-on-a-stick either, Its almost as big as me. It totally owns.    Last night I had an angry old woman come in my line and ask me the following- " Fettah zehh deh behhhhh ?".. uh..WTF! Of course I had no idea what the hell she was saying so she had to keep repeating herself, but it kept sounding the same! So I just repeated what she was saying right back to her.. " Fettah zehh deh behhh "!.. She got even more angry but at least it got her to talk like a normal human being, she was asking- " what is the date "?..........* sigh * Whatever.. Anyway...  A problemo Cheryl and I have been having was finally resolved last night, afterwards she asks me " Does all this count as an argument ?" im like yeah, I would say so, then she tell me " That wasnt so bad, can we have make-up sex now ?"...  8O  ..  8)  ..  8}  ..  >;}  .. I love this woman!!     Her smile begins to curl In this or any other summer She is something altogether diffrent Never just an ordinary girl ~Counting Crows

      Extra short one tonight kids.... Its been a long day, a long night and its going to be the same tomorrow I bet. To top it all off, my lag is awful and my head is hammering.  On a good note, im almost done with some new art pieces, if I still like them when im done ill add them to my page.   Im still just starting to get into this whole fitness hoohaw and so far its really not so bad.. It would be alot easier though if I could sucker a friend into jogging or biking with me.. hmm... Also, while im thinkin about it, thanks for the ears tonight Sarah and Janci, you folks are great, and away i go, Its past my bedtime....

      Last night my neighbor had his music up so damn loud at 4am that my whole apartment was buzzing..  at 4am! I had to be up at 7am! .. I walked across my bedroom and banged on my wall like a maniac till it stopped. Then as soon as I laid down again it started back up! Obviously they weren't gonna listen to me... So I called the apartment security AND the cops, that worked much better. Bastards..   In other news today.. A woman tried to use her drivers license as a credit card, then had a fit when i discreetly pointed it out. There is no spoon. The Olsen twins are no way better than the Bucci twins, Sorry Kyle. I need to do crunches and not sit ups. Asteroids to not concern me and finally.... Eggplant is disgusting.  The End.

      Sup Kids, Frys sucks extra because I have to goto work at 8am tomorrow! Its almost 2am right now and im not the least bit snoozey! argh! I blame ze faiyah! * snap *   Have you ever wanted to rewind time? Just go back and redo something because you think it was stupid.. Yeah, that was me last night.. I finally opened up to Cheryl about some problems I been carrying around.. You see, I usually bottle up my troubles and sweep them under the rug, but in the past, doing that just caused more problems in the end. I told myself that I wouldnt do that with Cheryl, no matter what..   She said shes glad that I told her but I know it upset her alot.. :(   We eventually worked it out and things feel better again, but gawd I still hated to do it! Its not going to be as easy as I thought, not bottling things.. But I guess, this was a good start...  Love ya hun  =}   On a lighter side.. Did you people know that there are SexClubs out there?? I didnt! I wouldnt even think they would be legal!  This crazy girl at my work invited me to go " check it out ".. lemmie think....uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. NO

       Its my Friday finally. I get to evade oblivion for two whole days, gotta love that. Im in a weird mood tonight so beware of falling rocks ahead..    I keep getting hot and cold lately, maybe im coming down with something. Who knows. An old ex-girlfriend left a message on my machine while I was working, I think she gets lonely sometimes and just needs an ear, Poor thing. Shes a single mom, And shes doing an amazing job despite it all. And no the children are not mine incase some of you are wondering..   A friend of mine sent me the Nick Berg beheading video earlier.. I kinda stared at the ' play ' button for awhile, not sure if I really wanted to see it, but curiosity is a killer and im the cat.. I dont think I have ever,  EVER  seen anything so awful and brutal in my life. People amaze me.    I should get up early tomorrow and have my car ignition checked out.. But I dunno, doubt it. Its getting warmer and I should start swimming again.. But I dunno, doubt it. Should do alot of things.. But you guessed it..  doubt it . Maybe tomorrow illl feel better..

       I did it again! This afternoon I crept ever so stealthily from my MooCave, to the lil sample table where " Farmer Jon's sausage links " were being handed out.. The vendor woman had left for lunch... So I snatched up every last sausage and ran cackling back to my cave to devour them all... Yeah I know, im a sad soul.. But I can change!.. I could!..  DAMNIT I CAN CHANGE !!!   Besides that, I had no luck finding an orange kitten to share my home with. Im still addicted to Sarah's SugarCult CD. Lauren ate my last PopTart. My friend Brian is trying to quit smoking, woo. I think I should take up running to fix my lil pudge tummy and lastly.. much love for the Lovey!

       Hey Gang. How goes it? Good? Kay.. Ive been letting my hair grow out the last couple month's just for a change and yanno.. im almost positive that it has a mind of its own, maybe its just angry because I chopped it all off and kept it short all these years..  Anyway, back at the ranch, life rolls on. My store is going to get remodeled sometime soon and I hope they do something nice with the MooCave! ( like add a big flat screen TV )   My roof started to leak the other night, hmm maybe ' Leak ' isn't the word.. Ill rephrase.. My roof started to pour the other night. Turns out the folks above me had some valve burst in their dishwasher * sigh * oh well my kitchen floor needed a bath anyway. that's all for now me thinks, I got very special TO-DO-LIST today.   Nick's To-Do's   1.  Make And Eat A CheeseBurger  2.  Find An Orange Kitten To Name Nacho   3.  Do Dishes  4.  Ready My Battle Armor ( Iron my work-shirts )  5.  Slack off

       Well today I got to sit in the DMV for over half an hour cause my insurance company made a typo, that was about as fun as a punch in the face.. Besides that today was pretty good.  Finally got around to getting a " momma's day " gift.. My brother and I split the cost on this big ceramic elephant head.. haha im sure that sounds pretty funny but its actually really cool looking, she digs crazy animals..   As I was driving home I passed a shoe in the middle of the road  ( ive been seeing shoes on or around the roads alot lately )  and I just cant seem to picture how this happens. Is road rage getting so bad that people have resorted to hurling footwear?..  I can just imagine bumping into a friend- " Hey nick, how are y.... Um.. Where is your other shoe man? " I can smile and tell them " Some jerk on the 101 cut me off...  "

Good thing cause the bill for my plane tickets to Wisconsin just arrived,  Zounds ! And get this madness! I got a letter saying there is a recall on Pontiac Sunfire's made during a certain time ( of course mine being one of them ) They have some kind of ignition defect, so I guess ill go and have that taken care of so I dont yanno... Explode or anything. =P    My friend Brian got back from Iraq awhile back ( marine fella ) and he has introduced the friday nighters to a new game-  Vampire; The masquerade , and Its pretty damn cool actually. Werewolves are still cooler tho damnit..  hmm I think thats about all for tonight, Im gonna go watch one of my favorite flicks " Fallen " I found it uber cheap so I had to have it!   PS-  Thank you for makin CDs for me miss Sarah!

       Only 11 more weeks till i see Cheryl again.. Good thing ' FatherTime ' isnt a real man, i would be over his house EVERY day trying to make him speed up time.. " are we there yet?.. are we there yet?.. are we there yet?.. are we there yet?" ....  Anyway, today was another day of action and excitement in SunCity!.. Actually no it wasnt, i just like to say that, it makes me happy. It was a really simple day.. towards the end of the night this girl i work with came to me about her recent breakup... the whole story.. every detail.. What is it about me that screams " tell me your pain and suffering"  haha, not that i really mind, i mean i always pay attention and  try  to offer advice, i dunno, maybe i should just become a certified therapist and get paid for it..   In other news.. I learned that Trent Reznor is doing the soundtrack for the upcoming-  D00M III   Yowza!!

        GO SHARKS!! WOOOOOOO!!  ... .. .  ok ok i really dont know anything about hockey, im just going along with my buddy Sparo.  I dont follow many sports actually, besides Football ( Miami owns! ) and alil Baseball.   Im mere moments away from having to goto work,  Fry's was not swallowed up by the earth like i wished and my lovey Cheryl does not think Calling-In-Dead is a good idea.. So back to the MooCave i go.  Its funny how when you are off, time goes screaming past you... but as soon as you step into work, it stops, completely, sometimes i think it even goes backwards at some parts of the day!   Hmm the Ad-Ninja has struck again i see. Yanno those ads that suddenly appear hanging from your doorknob, or wedged between the door and frame? yeah, that is the work of the ad-ninja..  Sometimes he even strikes in parking lots, putting ads on your car window! Someday i will catch him...  Someday ...

      Not a whole lot new.. Just grinding along till vacation comes. My CD finally arrived, woo! I added a new drawing ( a request from my cousin Jaime and his band ) But as for the Gorilla request.. Well.. Its still getting the best of me. Thats really about it for now. Ill leave you folks with this clip from the Book of Blood. I thought it was pretty damn cool...   The dead have highways, and they run, lines of ghost trains, dream carriages and pedestrians, across a wasteland just behind our everyday lives. An endless traffic of departed souls. Their thrum and throb can sometimes be heard in the broken places of our world, through cracks made by acts of cruelty, violence and depravity.  They have sign posts, these highways, and bridges, turnpikes and... Intersections. It is at these intersections, where the endless crowds of the dead mingle and cross, that this forbidden highway is most likely to spill through into our world, the traffic is so heavy at these cross roads, and the voices of the dead so shrill, here the barriers that separate our reality from theirs is the worn dreadfully thin. ~Clive Barker

      Well today was a fun day.. I came into work and the whole store is hotter than  HELL , it was awful. The assistant manager tells me the AC is broken... But! Afew hours later I have to go into the managers office to deliver some paperwork and guess what?... Her office room is cold!! Like a nice little igloo!! AC broken my ass!! I dont get it.. Anyway.. Here comes the great part.. The store was SO freaking hot that almost all of our refrigerated sections ( Deli, Meat and Produce ) burned themselves out trying to keep up with the temperature!.. I was supposed to go home at 10:30 but I ended up staying alil past midnight, I had to help pull  ALL  of the product out of the deli and the meat departments. And the meat department was thee worst! Everything was all hot and soggy and leaking and stinking. Especially the chickens and the fishes.. It was disgusting.. Im so glad im not working in the morning.. I feel so sorry for whoever has to sort through all that crap, and put back whatever can be saved..    D'OHH!!! ~Homer Simpson

      Hey Kids. Going to be working like a maniac this week and only got one day off too! It bites but at the same time I really need the money right now. Also I have afew more pictures to finish up before I can be totally free. The gorilla project was a flop! Im just going to start it over completely.. Im trying to capture a  gorilla thats calm and majestic looking, not something from the movie " Congo "!  The days are finally dwindling down for Cheryl and I. She will be living here by the end of July and I hope she will be ok with the change. Wisconsin and Arizona are so completely different.. The land, the population, the weather, the drivers! Ha.. But on top of that, I think my real worry comes from the fact that shes moving so far away from home. It would be hard on me too.. On the brighter side I know that I love this lil snowbug more than anything, and my friends loved her, and my parents loved her, haha even the people at my work loved her... I hope all this love and care here will be enough.    With fingernails that shine like justice! ~Cake

      Today.. Last day off.. So hungry.. Lazy.. Dont feel like moving.. Or cleaning.. Should.. Company coming later.. Bah.. Need maid.. A French one.. With a skirt.. Sorry Ill stop now, hahaha.  Yeah there is going to be some gaming later today. Then in the wee hours of the morning my parents will be leaving for Daytona for 2 weeks, I bet my brother is ecstatic, he can sleep in for once! I still have awful flashbacks of being woken up all the time by my mom, basically if shes awake you have to be too.. Hmm but now that I think about it, when I moved out I had a girlfriend at the time who would do the same thing, so I guess I didnt really escape it did I? haha oh well.   Who wants a Spicy Chicken Rice Bowl?? I do! I do!..   Later folks and happy birthday to the hot lil starfish.. bloop!..   Alright, let me be the first to congratulate you then... You get one vagina for the rest of your life. Real smart Frank. Way to work it through. ~Old School

      Ahoy ya salty dogs! Today is payday!.. But it sorta sucks cause half of it has to goto rent this week..  Vultures!!  Anyway. My art page is down, aint that some crap? They have to do maintenance work and its taking forever.. I feel so naked and cold! Im almost done with my list of scribble requests, tho this last one is taking awhile.. I have draw a silverback gorilla's face in color and as realistic as possible. I hope I can have it finished by this weekend. I got my haircut yesterday and the woman decided to go nuts, so I lost about a week of growing. I really wish I could do it my damn self.. Cause you suck Sasha at GreatClips! I think from now on, if barbers dont do a good job we should be able to cut THEIR hair.. With big ass hedge clippers! I think I best be on my way now, gotta meet some folks for Chinese.. mmm Shrimp fried rice..  Aight be coo! * Salute *   Jansox: so you watching those movies alone or with friends? Azmordius: just me, my couch and my long john silvers Jansox: ...Is that your penis? Azmordius: hahahah!

      Sup gang. Its late, Im all out of applesauce and just so everyone knows.... My slinky could out-slink Cheryl's slinky!!   =)  Haha! Besides that.. Tomorrow is my Friday.  Shazayum!  This morning my seller from Amazon replied to me about my CD, he apologized lots and is telling me to give it just afew more days, so I suppose thats what I shall do. I think after work tomorrow I shall get a haircut, but only if the right person is there, its getting pretty long now and I want to keep it that way ( just less poofy ).. After that I may go poke around in BestBuy and see whats new.. Then I have to stop being a slackass and get down to some serious scribbling.  I found out a big union meeting took place today over the new labor contract, and as far as I know there will be no strike! Thank god! Spending my days on a sidewalk with a picket sign was not sounding exciting..  At all!   I think thats about it for now pork chops, so be kind to the Lorax, he speaks for the trees! And best of luck to my Nacho-mate's momma.    They all float down here.... ~It

       My CD didnt come today! For the lova gawd I am so cursed! So I decided to e-mail my seller about it... And I hope I hear back.  I drew another pic today, but now I really need to stop with the personal creations for a bit. I need to start working on my request list before it gets out of hand. Also I have to get back to reading my friend Sarah's book before I forget what the hells goin on or she thinks I didnt like it, haha. One of the requests im really excited about is a logo for my cousin Jamie's metal band "Grip".  Everything I do ill continue to post at DA of course.     http://azraiel.deviantart.com/  On my way home I stopped to get gas and had the same cashier girl I had last time. She looks so familiar to me and I dont know why.. I have such a bad memory.. I think ill ask her about it next time, though im sure she will just laugh.  Then as I was coming upto my door a moth attacked me... But I didnt squeal like a woman this time!  Score!  haha! Be safe kids.   which one of yalls Neebol?..  Yooooo Mamma! ~MiB2

      Yanno what sucks?... Having no eraser on your pencil... yeah that about sucks. It sucks  ALMOST  as much as having your girlfriend leap out at you while your changing clothes and scream-  Chumbawah!! ... Yeah...  However, having no eraser does not suck more than having to goto work in less than an hour. Grrrr. Grats to my Nacho-mate for her new Job! Eat more applesauce!   MSparo27: dude youve got like pimp dust on you or something dont you? Azmordius: no its actually nerd flakes Azmordius: looks similar huh? MSparo27: HAHAHHAHAHA

      Hey kids, how goes the going? Same ole hoot here. Can you believe that the craft shop down the street is sold out on Air-Brushes? Oh well, I am too lazy to go driving across town and I fear if I buy one from Walmart it will fall apart after an hour of use...  Down with Walmart!!   Anyway Ill just check back on Wednesday like the girly at the counter suggested.  My CD still has not come!!.. The order letter says that if I have not received my item by the 20th I need to call some number, tomorrow is the 20th.. I hope I dont have to call.. * sigh *  In other news, I have to get up early tomorrow cause my family wants to do breakfast for FathersDay.  I been having a mad flood of ideas for drawings and I might be doing afew art projects with some other folks from DeviantArt! Thats always cool.  Never EVER eat red beef jerky and lastly.. This is a travesty! A sham! And a mockery! Its a Travashamockery!! Sorry.. I love that commercial.. hahaha. Gnight Everyone!   Soon as that camera goes off, he's gonna f*ck that little dog! ~Interloper

      Today was pretty decent. I got paid, drove my lil bro to his doctors appointment, found a nice CD burner for a good price, had lunch and saw the Riddik movie with my budmo. I liked the movie, there was so much detail put into it! And it wasnt cheesy or over acted like I was afraid of. Go see it says I. Tonight has been a little less than decent, but I guess thats life and your right Sparo.     ---=====((((@      \o/  AHHHH!!    I think im going to go look into some paints and maybe an airbrush tomorrow so I can start knocking off some of my art jobs. Maybe hit the pool for a bit. I need to dust. Need to vacuum. Still no CD in the mail!... And hmm.. I dunno, who cares! I need a jellybean...    I guess I finally found out, all the little things. I know where they go. It's such a shame, all the little things. I held on so long. Why don't you confuse me again? Just a little more.. ~Orgy

      Not much news this time, it was a lazy Tuesday.  My connection was being crummy all day.  I watched a baseball game with some friends at Palo Verde Pizza.   ( the Diamondbacks bit it again )  Right now my connection is still being crummy.  I Did some new art.  Still need to work on some other art projects. My CD has yet to arrive.  And my mood ring has been black and purple all day, whatever that means. I think thats about it.  Exit stage left.   Under my skin. Through my mind.  Spinning around. Losing balance all the time.

         I have more artwork posted !! haha yeah Im becoming such a scribble addict arent I? Oh well, I guess there are worse things to be addicted to..     Today I found out I have a pretty sweet pension going! From what I understand, if I decide to stay with Fry's, when im around 38-40 years old I can retire and be totally taken care of.. Its funny that I been there almost 9 years and im just now learning about this stuff.   :P  Anyway..   In other news I found a mood-ring in the parking lot today! I have been wearing it ever since and so far its been mostly Blue, then some Black, and for a short time it was purple.. If anyone knows what the hell the colors mean, please leave a comment, lol. I need to stop now and get to packing my lovey's birthday loot. * salute * G'Night!   Memory, prophecy and fantasy. The past, the future and the dreaming moment between are all one country.

      I found out a bit ago that a friend of mine at work had a grocery palette fall onto his foot and mash up some toes pretty bad.. Why didnt I think of that? I bet he gets afew weeks off with injury pay!... JK, I hope hes okay.  =)  I just got another art-job!  Score!  Painting dinosaurs on the walls of a daycare. Sadly the dinos have to be simple shapes, brightly colored and smiling. My original idea was to have dinos with twisted claws and bloody jagged teeth... But they told me that might be a tad disturbing come nap time. ooooo! My nachos are done now. That means go time for Nick. Be safe out there folks and be sure to love your lovies.   She is everything to me. The unrequited dream. The song that no one sings. The unattainable. She's a myth that I have to believe in. All I need to make it real.

I think ill give it just afew more days before I start to hassle the seller.. * crosses fingers *   Today I finished shopping for Cheryl's birthday but I cant say anything about it here cause she reads this now and then, haha.. As for my dad, I think my bro and I are going to split the cost of a CD burner, he has been wanting one for awhile now. So thats that for my shopping needs, hurray! Now I can return to my slackage..  mmmmmmmmm..  for now at least..  I saw some kids almost get in a fist fight in a bookstore today, over whether or not the Hulk could beat up Batman.. How stupid.. I mean Jeez.. Everyone knows Spider-Man could beat up both of them! hahah ok im going to bed now, and remember, only  YOU  can prevent forest fires!    The dark one is gathering all armies to him..

After that im off to do lunch with Angmo and maybe after a quick run of shopping I can squeeze in a movie! Woot! My buddy Ronin is going to use his magical coloring abilities on a black and white sketch of mine and I cant wait for the result! I love mixing talents and seeing what comes out.. And yes, ill show you all.   =)  I best get to bed now, beware the Cthulhu!   We are all god's madmen. ~Bram Stoker

        I think this whole being-more-healthy-thing is working! As I was cleaning out my closet I found that I was able to fit into jeans I had to stop wearing last year, I have more energy, Even people at my work have started asking " are you loosing weight? ". haha, Maybe I wont have this lil pudge tummy when Cheryl sees me next month. =)   Speaking of Cheryl, This Friday I need to go buy state maps for whatever is between Wisconsin and Arizona, I have them all written down someplace.. I think with those and MapQuest directions we should do fine. After that I need to do some Birthday shopping. Then I dont know, I would like to go see  Troy  or  KillBill2 .. hmm..   Grr.. I would be off on Thursday but I swapped days with another stocker so he could go out of town * sigh * oh well, lets just say its my good deed for the year.  I think im gonna go watch me some Conan O'Brian and then hit the hay. Eat more kiwi!   So I run.. Hide.. Tell myself..  I'll start.. Again.. Brand new name.. And eyes.. That see..

        Zounds!! ... What? Its just fun to say, try it... Go on you know you wanna.. Ok anyway.  I got more art projects to start! And I think my block is breaking so thats a plus. I also have been thinking more about starting my own lil business painting windows for game shops, pizza places, grocery stores, whoever has blank windows.  Also I have been thinking of buying an airbrush and seeing how I do with that, seems there is a fair demand for car, truck, motorcycle and helmet art around here. Just afew idears I have been playing with... We shall see. I better get my dreamer ass ready for work. I added 2 new pics to my ArtPage btw! Later ya swabbies!   It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time. Stand out on the edge of the earth.. Dive into the center of fate..

      Weeeell, I got everything on my list done today, How great is that?..... Real great, Thats how great.  I picked up my paycheck and made the bill collectors happy.  Then I took my car to the shop for its recall checkup and had over 100 bucks of work done for free,  Woo!   Then went to my favorite toy store, BestBuy, and snatched up some new music, You were so right Laurren, Thanks.   I got " Zeromancer " and " 30 Seconds to Mars "  Very cool stuff if your into bands like Orgy, NIN or GrivityKills.  Finally I stopped at home for Gyros, Yumm.    I think after I finish blogging and munching on applesauce,  I am going to go try to finish cleaning and sorting my apartment. I still need to make extra room for Cheryl and I have tons to go through... Yeah, im a bit of a packrat...  But anyway, Have a great night folks! And remember, Dont pet the kobalds!   I memorized how warm your body felt  as you lay half asleep beside me.  And I memorized the way the sunlight  filled the room and played upon your body  I miss..

Theater shows, Animal shows, Magic Shows, Comedy shows, Music shows, Gambling, Karaoke, Shopping, Dancing and of course more Porn than you can shake a stick at.  In our 3 days I think we hit just about everything and drank something new with every stop!    *Glug Glug Glug. Long pause. Strained voice.*  "Smoooooth" ...        Hahaha, I hope next time we all go, I can bring Cheryl along, I promise I wont get drunk and climb up any statues this time!  Tomorrow I need to do bills and catch up on all my errands, take my car in for its check and then get to cleaning out my apartment. Yap, its back to the real world.. Till July that is.  C'mon July!     My hopes are so high Your kiss might kill me  So won't you kill me? So I die happy ~Dashboard Confessional

         Howdy dumplings, Your gonna be without me for a bit cause at 11am I will be on my way to Vegas.  When I get back im sure my camera will be packed with pics so give me a poke on AIM sometime if youd like a peek.     Also, Cheryl and I decided that at the end of my July vacation we will drive back to Arizona together, That way she can bring all the things she wants and also have her own car here.  MapQuest says going from Wisconsin to Arizona will be a 29 hour drive, But with a case of Starbucks coffee and afew bags of JellyBeans im pretty confident I can get us home in 13..  =P     Seriously though.. Im really excited and really scared at the same time, But i think im leaning more on the excited side  =)    I best finish packing and get some shut eye. You tarts behave yourselves!

From miles around, hordes of old people came stumbling and staggering into Fry's. Groaning and whining and bumping into each other. It was like night of the living dead!!

      Ahoy kids. It been alil bit.. Yeah yeah.. Ive been slacking alil. The other day a friend of mine at work, " Old Yorker Larry ", had to cut out early cause he was having chest pains. When he went to the hospital, they told him his heart is basically failing. Also, he is too old to go under the knife so they just sent him home with alotta drugs and told him he has anywhere from two weeks to two years to live.. Pretty crummy huh? Ill miss the old goomba.  =/  In other news.. This is my last week alone in this apartment, only 6 days till I leave and come back with Cheryl. It needs to rain here, like bad. I need to work on new pictures. I think thats about all there be for now...  Oh yeah! Before I forget, Dont eat that lil brown potato chip at the bottom of the bag.. Its pretty gross.   Yeah, but you know what? This one... This one right here... This was my dream, my wish. And it didn't come true. So I'm taking it back. ~The Goonies

      Ever feel like your just waiting for something to happen? Some chance to do something that you really enjoy and that actually means something to someone?  Ever feel like your really meant for something more? Sometimes yea.. I kinda do..  Maybe im just doing things wrong.. Or maybe I just need a little change of pace.. Or maybe im just weird..   I really don't know what you mean, seems like salvation comes only in my dreams. I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme. Can this world really be as sad as it fucking seems? ~NIN

      If you have not gone to see  Spider-Man2 . Go. Right now. Seriously.  Tomorrow is my only day off this week and wow its felt like forever. Im starting to think they are making me suffer for having a vacation this month. Only 9 more days too.. Mmmm, ok anyway.. Where are all these perverted old women coming from lately?! Yesterday a group of them came thru my line arguing over who had the dirtiest shirt, then one of them suggested that I let them have mine.. Then they start arguing over who should be the one to take it off me..  EWWWWW!!  Then this afternoon, this old woman needed a pen, so as I was digging through my apron pockets I said.. " There is one somewhere in this mess " she replies with.. " Ooh can I help feel around? "  EWWWWW!!  Just remembering all this again makes my tummy twist, and makes me want a transfer to Flagstaff even more!... Hmm its getting pretty late, I think im gonna go crash so I dont sleep away my one day of freedom.. Remember kids, dont let them " lil ole ladies " fool you..   Defense is paper thin. Just one touch and I'd be in. Too deep now to ever swim against the current. So let me slip away.  ~Dashboard Confessional

      Aaaaaaand here I am! Yeah I know, its been an uber long time.. But things have been pretty nuts lately. My trip to Wisconsin was alot of fun, its so green and spacious there and her family was really nice. The drive back was not as scary as I thought it would be, just a couple "bug incidents".. But anyway there was so much to see on the way, we took a ton of pictures, and we only got lost once!! Amazing!! Sadly.. The morning man at my work is out of town so now I have to be the morning man. It sucks. I hate mornings with such passion... OH! And speaking of jobs.. Cheryl got one already and today is her first day! I will be sure to add more in later, I must run to the store now.. Woosh.
