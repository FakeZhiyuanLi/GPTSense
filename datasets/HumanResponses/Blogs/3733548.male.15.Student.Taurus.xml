      And if you told me to jump off a cliff, I'd say okay. Ive done it now, and now I'm not biased to it now. well, I'm in Knoxville now and its great, we got here the day before&nbsp;yesterday, and its been great, we walked around town night before last and then we went to this uber cool bookstore last night, tonight I dont know what we're doing, but I strongly believe that Adam can increase the "fun factor" of the night, he's been able to each night. well, Ive got to go now, Ill be posting more often now.&nbsp; talk to you later

      &nbsp;      AND again I say no! Jack Black as My FAVORITE SUPERHERO!? (The green Lantern, which the movie&nbsp;is still in development is to put Jack Black on as The Green Lanturn.) no no no. Dont get me wrong but this is what has been said about the film:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gossip site(  urlLink aint it cool news )&nbsp;says that the film adaptation (of The Green Lantern)&nbsp;is being described as a "crazy and zany film" and will be in the realm of Jim Carrey's "The Mask." The site also says that DC Comics is objecting to this approach but that Warner Bros. has the final say.&nbsp;"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This just dissapoints me, The Green LAnturn has always been my fave superhero, and Now Warner Bros. is going to degreade his persona, oh how the mighty have been tripped and have fallen...

      Well guys sorry I havent posted in a while... Ive had a Busy week. Well, I went to an appointment with my mom yesterday, it was okay, but todays wasn't, I wish I could have been there. I went to Charlies house last night, it was AWESOME!! we had about, 5 guitars goin at the same time, it was great, all there, praisin God, yea, but I forgot my guitar, so halfway thru I went and talked to Amanda, and then that was about the basis of my night. Went to the mall today, got some "Love Spell" put on me and saw some girl pick her wedige, that was repulsive, what  HAS  the world come to, when girls have the fortitude to pull up their skirts and pick wedgies? I dont know. Well, I'll post more later, mom needs the computer.

I'm gonna go play my guitar for the rest of the night tonight, and eventually fall asleep as I normally do when I need to think deeply. maybe I really need to breathe deeply, take a break, but I cant. Umm, the word "umm" just epitomizes that which I am feeling right now... I'll explain in the morning im too tired and blank minded to know right now...ive got church in the morning.

      okay, took a shower tryin to go to bed.... dont you just hate the feeling that your screaming, but you dont know what you're screaming about?... i dont kno... WHY DONT WE FREAKEN MOVE TO LAKELAND!? sorry about that recent outburst, just a little thing. umm, well, I wish we would move, I've got the best friends ever here, (no offence to the Fort Meadeans who accept me, though  you are so few in number) and people accept me. and I'd just really like it. either move or the stupid state law changes and lets me drive alone now... that'd be great, I'm not a bad driver.... maybe i Should do that now anyways, break the law, its not like i havent done it in the past. but o well... well i had much much more to write, but i gotta write an email now too, so Ill talk to all the few people that read this blog later, Goodnight

       And that is my favorite picture of him. I got to get picked up and go to his house tonight, before whence setting out unto the Wed. night service for fun. I got covered in shaving cream, popcorn and corn chips placed on me, and then I couldn't see, but Mandy, whom I met tonight gave me the gift of sight by wiping off one side of my "goggles" thus I was able to see. we sang then and, and heard Adam speak, which was another highlight, and then Marlon took me home. We will sit upon getting gason the way home for a moment. We were at the "PIX" Gas Station. there is a girl there that I met when we were having the "Scavenger Hunt" one Wed. night and I met her with Jonathan. Jon knew her, and we needed an Attendant to wipe our windshield for one of the "hits" that we had to film, she was that attendant. but It was funny tonight being that she obviously didnt remember who I was, but knew that I looked familiar and I was watching her try to figure out where she had seen me before. It was actually quite intriguing. but again, i must say, before i go to bed. Marlon Wareley is my FAVORITE South African.

      My first days of have been cool I guess, I have a good schedule, and Im sure I can get straight A's and have a good year this year, I have no last period class so I get outta school at 12:45 practically every day, which includes my lunch. which is cool, and I can graduate with 25 credits too. but you know whats funny, its already been two days, and Ive already found a girl on my radar that I admire, I hate that, I dont want to like people just yet I'm too quixotic, and it'll only be a matter of time before she hurts me ha ha. oh well, I'll control myself. Off of that subject now thanks, Ive got some cool teachers, and a  few  cool friends, I'm trying to stray away from the crowd that I was in last year, yet they are the only place I fit in, I trust God to help me. Which I am cool with doing. And it shouldnt be hard to do. on the 23rd I start college, and second semester I am a Seinor, wich I am technically now, but literally I wont be until next semeseter. So thats that. Goin to Adam's tomorrow. should be good, Ill post again from there. Goodnight.

      Or at least the muffin man, I had to bake muffins last night for this teacher breakfast thingy at school, and I'm not gonna go on a rant about "School" because it scares me, even the thoughts of such. So I baked muffins last night, talked to Jon on the phone, and then recorded some "musaac" until my eyelids obscured my vision. Ergo I was then Asleep. Thus, I woke up this morning fatigued and quite in need of a good espresso, alas I did not have this and I am now running on empty at this point and time.  But I will wrok thru it. Ill post more in a few mins when I can find something interesting to post about!

        Well I couldnt think of much to post on tonight and I knew that I needed to stay consistent in my posts. so I know that which I am going to post about tonight. Saturday night was the greatest. We had our first "youth whom are going into the ministry" small group meeting thing. it was bliss for me, I really needed something like that. We got to learn alot that night and share alot too (yes I did still mange to stick my fott in my mouth as always a few times). Today, was a fairly decent day, Matt kept me up til 3 the morning before church by playing music. as he always does before going off to bed, the only thing was was that I had my guitar out, so I'd hear a song and be like "I love that song, Ihave to learn it" so I would, so now I know 311 "Love Song" which is an awesome song to say the very least and I also know "Float On" by Modest Mouse. I learned more, but alas I am tired tongiht and I have since forgotten the songs, and Matt took the CD that I learned the songs from home. oh well! okaeday then. well we get to church and church stressed me out. i need to get ore sleep before church later on, i know this now. but it was awesome! there were quite a few people from Anna Maria Island down and it was great getting to see all them again, I even got to know that Ben and I are alot alike. Then, we went to a cookout thingy and it was goooood, I got to meet some new people, in particular, Kendra (i do hope that is the correct spelling) a friend of Amandas, she was quite cool. After the cookout thingy Adam, Matt, Lora and I returned to Adams house. Then, everyone but me went out to eat. and I did some latin and got to eventually talk to my BEST FRIEND Amanda which I enjoyed muchly. But just for a moment, let me deviate off to some "ranting" about my friend. I love my best friend (in a totally "friend manifesto" not a "more than friend manifesto") and she is in my opinion one of my my favorite people. we had a few moments today, but the most intriguing was when something was said about "a mission trip to go fishing" and she and I both, at the same time said "we would be fishers of.......fish!!" which was quite interesting. we have the whole "mental connection thing" goin on and we tend to sya the same things at thte same time, or finish each others sentences, which is cool. I would have a Best Friend no other way. In the great words of Lassie "WOOF! WOOF!"
