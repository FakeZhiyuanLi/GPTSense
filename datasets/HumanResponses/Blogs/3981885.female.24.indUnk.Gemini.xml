      After moving back to Japan, I started to work as an English teacher at a private school. Although, this is only my temporary job until I get my carrer job, I was so surpried that I actually like teaching children who are&nbsp;at the age between 13-19 years old. After few weeks of working there, I have realized something I never knew about myself. That is how much of a difficult time I have remembering all the names of students. I never had trouble remembering, Jack, Matt, Tim, Mike, Sara, Maria, Kim, etc. When it comes to Japanese names, my memories are like size of a rat. They all sound way too familiar to me. I have one student named "Norihiro" and the other is called "Yasunari". I don't even know why, but&nbsp;I always mix their names together and ended up calling one of them "Noriyasu". It is so bad. I talk to so many students at school. I sure know their faces, but their names, no matter how many times I hear them, I seem to forget them all. I called one of my friend's baby "Mizuki" when it was actually "Hazuki". So close, but not quite right. I think there are way too many different names in Japan, when in the States, I at least know 3 people named Jim, Dan, or Rob. I think I need to just call all the boys Chuck and all the girls Mary.

      Janglish is what I speak. This is what happens when you live in the States for almost 10 years and spending most of your adolescence time over there. You started to learn new language when you are not even expert in your own native language. After doing this for 10 years, you ended up finding yourself in a hole where you suck at both languages. Yeah I sure do speak Japanese fluently, but my Kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanse as one of the writting style) are often corrected by the people who are younger than me. No need to explain how much English I speak. Yes I can read, write, and speak in English, but so very far from being perfect at it. I might not be an expert on neither Japanese nor English, but I am so proud to say, "I am master in Janglish"!!!!

      Reina, one of my best friend who is the only one living near me, is leaving me. She will be leaving to SF to study abord for at least 2 years. Knowing that she will have blast in Kali, I am so jerlous, but more so, I will miss her. So rest of my crew from Korea all got together in 有楽町（Yuuraku-cho) on Saturday night. I got there a little earlier, but apperently Makoto was too excited to get togher as well, so we met up earlier and hang out until we met up with Tae-Kwang, and Keita. Reina, the main person for that night showed up a little later. Somehow, when all of us get together, we always ended up going to a Korean resutaurant. Started with 生ビール（freshly brewed beer) we ordered some Korean cuisine and kept on eating and drinking. Korean food there was just amazing. So delicious. I had couple of beer, then drank 抹茶ミルク（greentea liquor with milk). Such a girlie drink. Well of course, I ended up drinking my Shouchuu on the rock at the end. All of us were drunk as hell. Well the princess of the night Reina then suggested that all of us should go to Karaoke. We must do what the princess says, so we did. We stumbled out of the restaurant and went to Big Echo in Yuuraku-cho. Turned out to be, Karaoke was so much fun. Not like in the States, we do not have to sing infront of bunch of strangers. We are given a room and in there, only 5 of us, got to sing whatever we wanted. All of us were just singing whatever, but ended up singing all those old tunes from back when we were going to the same school in Korea. 2 hours have passed by so quick and at the end, we picked "世界に一つだけの花”, only one flower in the world. This song is about how each one of the flower has its own beauty and brings into the metaphor to us in society. Talking about how we should not seek for No1 cause we are already the only one. Singing that song together already made us so emotional, then Keita had to put "乾杯”, a toast. This is the song used often at the wedding in Japan, and talks about how "you" are now directed towards your new life and whatever the road you take, 君に幸せあれ・・・, may your road will be full of happiness...... wow. Seeing Keita singing that song to Reina almost brought tears in my eyes. So sweet. Well then of course, we had to finish the night with all of us singing "Re:Japan"　singing about 明日があるさ、明日がある。若い僕らには夢がある。There will be tomorrow. Tomorrow will definetly comes. To us youngsters, we have dream. So cheezy in English, but such a good song. By this time, we were all standing in the room, holding hands together and each of us took turns to sing each parts and singing the chorus together. Being so far away from Japan for such a long time, I do not have real childhood friends. I felt like they are the friends from childhood... although I only met them when I was 13 years old. It was one of those rare occasions where I felt connected with my own country and felt fortunate for being back to my own country. Knowing that I have those friends and they will be ther for me no matter what, gave a warm feelings inside. I will be ok. I will be ok in Japan...... hopefully. hehe.
