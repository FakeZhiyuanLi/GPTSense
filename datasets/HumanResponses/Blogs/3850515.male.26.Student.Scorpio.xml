       The blogosphere exploded (and subsequently imploded) this week with  urlLink news of Medicare's obesity inclusion .  You can see the effect in the following trend graph produced with  urlLink BlogPulse's Trend Tool :     While the blogger reaction has been mostly negative, I believe HHS did the right thing.  By addressing obesity, the healthcare system will hopefully prevent other long-term, high-cost illnesses such as diabetes, CHD, etc.  The HHS press release states that obesity-caused illnesses burden the Medicare system with a financial drain in the order of billions of dollars.  Much of the hand-wringing being done in blog posts centers around that fact that obesity treatment will likely occur under the rubric of behavioral modification, but frankly, our populace  needs  to change their behavior.  The current  urlLink Harper's Weekly Review  briefly mentions research done by Antronette Yancey stating that almost half of  Los Angeles County residents get less than 10 minutes of exercise per week.  The Harper's review also mentions a Robert Hancox study that found children who watch two hours of TV a night are at a greater risk to be overweight, have high cholesterol, and smoke.  Clearly, a large portion of our country is living a sedentary lifestyle, and the medical community has a responsibility to alter this behavior.  Interestingly, I have seen a fair amount of activity in the informatics community directed towards such behavioral modifications:  ranging from smoking cessation to stress reduction.  If proven effective, such procedures will amount to no/minimal cost solutions for many of the conditions escalating healthcare costs.  I first became aware of such affective therapy in  urlLink this Wired Magazine article,  and  urlLink Tim Bickmore's doctoral thesis (PDF)  on the topic was also quite interesting.  I've included a list of journal articles on these topics below.  If you have any other reading recommendations, please leave them in the comments or email them to me.     Association between child and adolescent television viewing and adult health: a longitudinal birth cohort study  (Robert J Hancox, MD, Barry J Milne, MSc and Richie Poulton, PhD)  The Lancet:  Volume 364, Issue 9430, Pages 257-262 (17 July 2004)   Background Watching television in childhood and adolescence has been linked to adverse health indicators including obesity, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol. However, there have been no longitudinal studies of childhood viewing and adult health. We explored these associations in a birth cohort followed up to age 26 years.  Methods We assessed approximately 1000 unselected individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972–73 at regular intervals up to age 26 years. We used regression analysis to investigate the associations between earlier television viewing and body-mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness (maximum aerobic power assessed by a submaximal cycling test), serum cholesterol, smoking status, and blood pressure at age 26 years.  Findings Average weeknight viewing between ages 5 and 15 years was associated with higher body-mass indices (p=0·0013), lower cardiorespiratory fitness (p=0·0003), increased cigarette smoking (p  Interpretation Television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with overweight, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol in adulthood. Excessive viewing might have long-lasting adverse effects on health.     Physical inactivity and overweight among Los Angeles County adults  (Antronette K. Yancey MD, MPH, Cheryl M. Wold MPH, William J. McCarthy PhD, Mark D. Weber PhD, Benedict Lee PhD, Paul A. Simon MD, MPH and Jonathan E. Fielding MD, MBA, MPH)  American Journal of Preventive Medicine:  Volume 27, Issue 2, August 2004, Pages 146-152   Objectives The present study examines sociodemographic, health status, health behavioral, and health-related self-perception correlates of physical inactivity in a large, multiethnic urban population.  Methods A random-digit-dialed telephone survey of a representative sample of 8353 Los Angeles County adults aged ≥18 years was conducted between September 17, 1999 and December 31, 2000. Data were analyzed to assess the prevalence and identify independent correlates of physical inactivity, defined as   Results Overall, the prevalence of sedentary adults was 41%. Lower educational attainment, female gender, advancing age, non–U.S. birthplace, poorer self-perceived health status, self-perceived depression, smoking, leisure-time television watching/computer use, and receiving a diabetes diagnosis were significantly related to sedentariness in both bivariate and multivariate analyses.  Conclusions Mental and physical health status were prominent correlates of sedentariness. Lower socioeconomic class was also associated with sedentary behavior. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between self-perceived overweight and sedentary behavior.     Effects of Internet behavioral counseling on weight loss in adults at risk for type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial.  (Tate DF, Jackvony EH, Wing RR.)  JAMA. 2003 Apr 9;289(14):1833-6.   CONTEXT: Weight loss programs on the Internet appear promising for short-term weight loss but have not been studied for weight loss in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes; thus, the longer-term efficacy is unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of an Internet weight loss program alone vs with the addition of behavioral counseling via e-mail provided for 1 year to individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized controlled trial conducted from September 2001 to September 2002 in Providence, RI, of 92 overweight adults whose mean (SD) age was 48.5 (9.4) years and body mass index, 33.1 (3.8).   INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a basic Internet (n = 46) or to an Internet plus behavioral e-counseling program (n = 46). Both groups received 1 face-to-face counseling session and the same core Internet programs and were instructed to submit weekly weights. Participants in e-counseling submitted calorie and exercise information and received weekly e-mail behavioral counseling and feedback from a counselor.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measured weight and waist circumference at 0 and 12 months.   RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed the behavioral e-counseling group lost more mean (SD) weight at 12 months than the basic Internet group (-4.4 [6.2] vs -2.0 [5.7] kg; P =.04), and had greater decreases in percentage of initial body weight (4.8% vs 2.2%; P =.03), body mass index (-1.6 [2.2] vs -0.8 [2.1]; P =.03), and waist circumference (-7.2 [7.5] vs -4.4 [5.7] cm; P =.05).   CONCLUSION: Adding e-mail counseling to a basic Internet weight loss intervention program significantly improved weight loss in adults at risk of diabetes.     Development of an exercise expert system for older adults.  (Boyette LW, Lloyd A, Manuel S, Boyette JE, Echt KV.)  J Rehabil Res Dev. 2001 Jan-Feb;38(1):79-91.   The purpose of this study was to develop a computerized exercise expert system (CEES) that creates tailored exercise plans for older adults. A panel of experts was selected in the areas of medicine, exercise physiology, health promotion, exercise psychology, and gerontology. The experts communicated with the principal investigator and the project members by mail, email, telephone, and expert meetings. A two-day workshop was held during the second year for the project members as well as local and national experts to review the CEES. The CEES demonstrated adequate inter-rater reliability (0.80) and criterion validity (0.70). Content validity was achieved by literature review and expert opinion. The CEES gathers information on the elder's health status, clinical factors, and exercise determinants that characterize specific barriers or incentives to exercise. The software program then develops individualized exercise prescriptions that are customized to older adults.     Print versus website physical activity programs: a randomized trial.  (Marshall AL, Leslie ER, Bauman AE, Marcus BH, Owen N.)  Am J Prev Med. 2003 Aug;25(2):88-94.   BACKGROUND: Mediated physical activity interventions can reach large numbers of people at low cost. Programs delivered through the mail that target the stage of motivational readiness have been shown to increase activity. Communication technology (websites and e-mail) might provide a means for delivering similar programs.  METHODS: Randomized trial conducted between August and October 2001. Participants included staff at an Australian university (n=655; mean age=43, standard deviation, 10 years). Participants were randomized to either an 8-week, stage-targeted print program (Print) or 8-week, stage-targeted website (Web) program. The main outcome was change in self-reported physical activity.  RESULTS: There was no significant increase in total reported physical activity within or between groups when analyzed by intention to treat (F [1,653]=0.41, p=0.52). There was a significant increase in total physical activity reported by the Print participants who were inactive at baseline (t [1,173]=-2.21, p=0.04), and a significant decrease in the average time spent sitting on a weekday in the Web group (t [1,326]=2.2, p=0.03).  CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the Print and Web program effects on reported physical activity. The Print group demonstrated slightly larger effects and a higher level of recognition of program materials.     Using Internet technology to deliver a behavioral weight loss program.  (Tate DF, Wing RR, Winett RA.)  JAMA. 2001 Mar 7;285(9):1172-7.   CONTEXT: Rapid increases in access to the Internet have made it a viable mode for public health intervention. No controlled studies have evaluated this resource for weight loss.   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a structured Internet behavioral weight loss program produces greater initial weight loss and changes in waist circumference than a weight loss education Web site.  DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial conducted from April to December 1999.  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one healthy, overweight adult hospital employees aged 18 to 60 years with a body mass index of 25 to 36 kg/m(2). Analyses were performed for the 65 who had complete follow-up data.  INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-month weight loss program of either Internet education (education; n = 32 with complete data) or Internet behavior therapy (behavior therapy; n = 33 with complete data). All participants were given 1 face-to-face group weight loss session and access to a Web site with organized links to Internet weight loss resources. Participants in the behavior therapy group received additional behavioral procedures, including a sequence of 24 weekly behavioral lessons via e-mail, weekly online submission of self-monitoring diaries with individualized therapist feedback via e-mail, and an online bulletin board.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight and waist circumference, measured at 0, 3, and 6 months, compared the 2 intervention groups.  RESULTS: Repeated-measures analyses showed that the behavior therapy group lost more weight than the education group (P =.005). The behavior therapy group lost a mean (SD) of 4.0 (2.8) kg by 3 months and 4.1 (4.5) kg by 6 months. Weight loss in the education group was 1.7 (2.7) kg at 3 months and 1.6 (3.3) kg by 6 months. More participants in the behavior therapy than education group achieved the 5% weight loss goal (45% vs 22%; P =.05) by 6 months. Changes in waist circumference were also greater in the behavior therapy group than in the education group at both 3 months (P =.001) and 6 months (P =.005).  CONCLUSIONS: Participants who were given a structured behavioral treatment program with weekly contact and individualized feedback had better weight loss compared with those given links to educational Web sites. Thus, the Internet and e-mail appear to be viable methods for delivery of structured behavioral weight loss programs.     Patients' experience with a diabetes support programme based on an interactive electronic medical record: qualitative study.  (Ralston JD, Revere D, Robins LS, Goldberg HI.)  BMJ. 2004 May 15;328(7449):1159.   OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of patients with type 2 diabetes in a web based disease management programme based on an interactive electronic medical record.   DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with patients enrolled in a diabetes care module that included access to their electronic medical record, secure email, ability to upload blood glucose readings, an education site with endorsed content, and an interactive online diary for entering exercise, diet, and medication.   SETTING: Patients' homes in Washington state, United States.   PARTICIPANTS: Nine participants aged 45-65 completed interviews before and after they used the programme.   RESULTS: Six themes emerged: feeling that non-acute concerns are uniquely valued; enhanced sense of security about health and health care; frustration with unmet expectations; feeling more able to manage; valuing feedback; and difficulty fitting the programme into activities of daily life. Three themes--valuing non-acute concerns, feeling secure, and unmet expectations--have particular relevance to the design and use of web based tools for care of patients with diabetes and chronic medical conditions.   CONCLUSION: Participants' experiences support further study of open access to the electronic medical record and online communication between patients and their care providers. The development of web based disease management programmes should take into account the specific needs and expectations of patients, and patients and providers should have candid discussions about what web based care can and cannot provide.     Evaluation of an internet-based physical activity intervention: a preliminary investigation.  (Napolitano MA, Fotheringham M, Tate D, Sciamanna C, Leslie E, Owen N, Bauman A, Marcus B.)  Ann Behav Med. 2003 Spring;25(2):92-9.   The Internet has the potential for delivering innovative, interactive physical activity (PA) interventions to large numbers of people. This study was designed to test the efficacy of an Internet intervention that consisted of a Web site plus 12 weekly e-mail tip sheets, compared with a waiting list control group. The Internet intervention was theory based and emphasized clear, graphical presentation of PA information. Sixty-five (30 intervention and 35 control) sedentary adult employees of several large hospitals (9 men and 56 women) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 study arms. Of the 65 participants, 57 completed the 1-month follow-up, and 52 completed the 3-month follow-up. At both 1 and 3 months, those in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have progressed in stage of motivational readiness for PA than participants in the control group: 1 month, c2(1, N =52) =4.05, p      Web-based tailored nutrition education: results of a randomized controlled trial.  (Oenema A, Brug J, Lechner L.)  Health Educ Res. 2001 Dec;16(6):647-60.   There is ample evidence that printed, computer-tailored nutrition education is a more effective tool for motivating people to change to healthier diets than general nutrition education. New technology is now providing more advanced ways of delivering tailored messages, e.g. via the World Wide Web (WWW). Before disseminating a tailored intervention via the web, it is important to investigate the potential of web-based tailored nutrition education. The present study investigated the immediate impact of web-based computer-tailored nutrition education on personal awareness and intentions related to intake of fat, fruit and vegetables. A randomized controlled trial, with a pre-test-post-test control group design was conducted. Significant differences in awareness and intention to change were found between the intervention and control group at post-test. The tailored intervention was appreciated better, was rated as more personally relevant, and had more subjective impact on opinion and intentions to change than the general nutrition information. Computer literacy had no effect on these ratings. The results indicate that interactive, web-based computer-tailored nutrition education can lead to changes in determinants of behavior. Future research should be aimed at longer-term (behavioral) effects and the practicability of distributing tailored interventions via the WWW.     The diabetes network internet-based physical activity intervention: a randomized pilot study.  (McKay HG, King D, Eakin EG, Seeley JR, Glasgow RE.)  Diabetes Care. 2001 Aug;24(8):1328-34.   OBJECTIVE: Because of other competing priorities, physical activity (PA) is seldom addressed in a consistent way in either primary care or diabetes education. This 8-week pilot study evaluated the short-term benefits of an Internet-based supplement to usual care that focused on providing support for sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes to increase their PA levels.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 78 type 2 diabetic patients (53% female, average age 52.3 years) were randomized to the Diabetes Network (D-Net) Active Lives PA Intervention or an Internet information-only condition. The intervention condition received goal-setting and personalized feedback, identified and developed strategies to overcome barriers, received and could post messages to an on-line "personal coach," and were invited to participate in peer group support areas. Key outcomes included minutes of PA per week and depressive symptomatology.   RESULTS: There was an overall moderate improvement in PA levels within both intervention and control conditions, but there was no significant improvement in regard to condition effects. There was substantial variability in both site use and outcomes within the intervention and control conditions. Internal analyses revealed that among intervention participants, those who used the site more regularly derived significantly greater benefits, whereas those in the control condition derived no similar benefits with increased program use.   CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based self-management interventions for PA and other regimen areas have great potential to enhance the care of diabetes and other chronic conditions. We conclude that greater attention should be focused on methods to sustain involvement with Internet-based intervention health promotion programs over time.

       (Peter Wanger  and Lene M Martin)  BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2004, 4:10   urlLink Open Access   urlLink BMC MIDM RSS Feed   Abstract (provisional)  Background  Drug therapy has become increasingly efficient, with more drugs available for treatment of an ever-growing number of conditions. Yet, drug use is reported to be sub optimal in several aspects, such as dosage, patient's adherence and outcome of therapy. The aim of the current study was to investigate the possibility to optimize drug therapy using computer programs, available on the Internet.  Methods  One hundred and ten officially endorsed text documents, published between 1996 and 2004, containing guidelines for drug therapy in 246 disorders, were analyzed with regard to information about patient-, disease- and drug-related factors and relationships between these factors. This information was used to construct algorithms for identifying optimum treatment in each of the studied disorders. These algorithms were categorized in order to define as few models as possible that still could accommodate the identified factors and the relationships between them. The resulting program prototypes were implemented in XHTML (user interface) and JavaScript (program logic).  Results  Three types of algorithms were sufficient for the intended purpose. The simplest type is a list of factors, each of which implies that the particular patient should or should not receive treatment. This is adequate in situations where only one treatment exists. A more elaborate model is required when treatment can by provided using drugs from different pharmacological classes and the selection of drug class is dependent on patient characteristics. An easily implemented set of if-then statements was able to manage the identified information in such instances. In a few situations the selection and dosage of drugs were depending on the degree to which one or more patient-specific factors were present. In these cases the implementation of an established decision model based on fuzzy sets was required. Computer programs based on one of these three models could be constructed regarding all but one of studied disorders. The single exception was depression, where reliable relationships between patient characteristics, drug classes and outcome of therapy remain to be defined.  Conclusion  Algorithms for optimizing drug therapy can, with presumably rare exceptions, be developed for any disorder, using standard Internet programming methods.

Such access may assist patients in the self-management of chronic diseases such as heart failure.  Objective: To assess how a patient-accessible online medical record affects patient care and clinic operations. The SPPARO (System Providing Access to Records Online) software consisted of a web-based electronic medical record, an educational guide, and a messaging system enabling electronic communication between the patient and staff.  Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a specialty practice for patients with heart failure. Surveys assessing doctor-patient communication, adherence, and health status were conducted at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. Use of the system, message volume, utilization of clinical services, and mortality were monitored.  Results: One hundred and seven patients were enrolled (54 intervention and 53 controls). At 12 months, the intervention group was not found to be superior in self-efficacy (KCCQ self-efficacy score 91 vs. 85, p=0.08), but was superior in general adherence (MOS compliance score 85 vs. 78, p=0.01). A trend was observed for better satisfaction with doctor-patient communication. The intervention group had more emergency department visits (20 vs. 8, p=0.03), but these visits were not temporally related to use of the online medical record. There were no adverse effects from use of the system.  Conclusions: Providing patients with congestive heart failure access to an online medical record was feasible and improved adherence. An effect on health status could not be demonstrated in this pilot study.

Objective: The authors evaluated a variety of user interfaces to determine whether different types of data entry methods employed by Personal health records may have an impact on the accuracy of patient-entered medical information.  Methods: Patients with disorders requiring treatment with thyroid hormone preparations were recruited to enter data into a web-based study application. The study application presented sequences of exercises that prompted free text entry, pick list selection, or radio button selection of information related to diagnoses, prescriptions, and laboratory test results. Entered data elements were compared to information abstracted from patients' clinic notes, prescription records, and laboratory test reports.  Results: Accuracy rates associated with the different data entry methods tested varied in relation to the complexity of requested information. Most of the data entry methods tested allowed for accurate entry of thyroid hormone preparation names, laboratory test names, and familiar diagnoses. Data entry methods that prompted guided abstraction of data elements from primary source documents were associated with more accurate entry of qualitative and quantitative information.  Conclusions: Different types of data entry methods employed by Personal health records may have an impact on the accuracy of patient-entered medical information. Approaches that rely on guided entry of data elements abstracted from primary source documents may promote more accurate entry of information.  KEYWORDS Medical Records; Internet; User-Computer Interface      urlLink First evaluation of the NHS Direct Online Clinical Enquiry Service: A Nurse-led Web Chat Triage Service for the Public   Nina Eminovic, Jeremy C. Wyatt, Aideen M. Tarpey, Gerard Murray, Grant J. Ingrams   J Med Internet Res 2004, June, 2; 6(2): e17   Background: NHS Direct is a telephone triage service used by the UK public to contact a nurse for any kind of health problem. NHS Direct Online (NHSDO) extends NHS Direct, allowing the telephone to be replaced by the Internet, and introducing new opportunities for informing patients about their health. One NHSDO service under development is the Clinical Enquiry Service (CES), which uses Web chat as the communication medium.  Objective: To identify the opportunities and possible risks of such a service by exploring its safety, feasibility, and patient perceptions about using Web chat to contact a nurse.  Methods: During a six-day pilot performed in an inner-city general practice in Coventry, non-urgent patients attending their GP were asked to test the service. After filling out three Web forms, patients used a simple Web chat application to communicate with trained NHS Direct triage nurses, who responded with appropriate triage advice. All patients were seen by their GP immediately after using the Web chat service. Safety was explored by comparing the nurse triage end point with the GP's recommended end point. In order to check the feasibility of the service, we measured the duration of the chat session. Patient perceptions were measured before and after using the service through a modified Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ) instrument. All patients were observed by a researcher who captured any comments and, if necessary, to assisted with the process.  Results: A total of 25 patients (mean age 48 years; 57% female) agreed to participate in the study. An exact match between the nurse and the GP end point was found in 45% (10/22) of cases. In two cases, the CES nurse proposed a less urgent end point than the GP. The median duration of Web chat sessions was 30 minutes, twice the median for NHS Direct telephone calls for 360 patients with similar presenting problems. There was a significant improvement in patients' perception of CES after using the service (mean pre-test TMPQ score 44/60, post-test 49/60; p=0.008 (2-tailed)). Patients volunteered several potential advantages of CES, such as the ability to re-read the answers from the nurse. Patients consider CES a useful addition to regular care, but not a replacement for it.  Conclusions: Based on this pilot, we can conclude that CES was sufficiently safe to continue piloting, but in order to make further judgments about safety, more tests with urgent cases should be performed. The Web chat sessions as conducted were too long and therefore too expensive to be sustainable in the NHS. However, the positive reaction from patients and the potential of CES for specific patient groups (the deaf, shy, or socially isolated) encourage us to continue with piloting such innovative communication methods with the public.

Traditionally, this involves a discussion with a physician, supplemented by written leaflet information directed at the specific procedure.  Objective: Comparison of the use and effectiveness of computer-based visualization opposed to standardized conversation for providing patients with information of forthcoming procedures (coronary catheters or endoscopy procedures).  Methods: Prospective, randomized trial with 56 participants allocated in two different groups: Visualization Group (standardized information supported by a tool for displaying two-dimensional pictures to explain medical facts as well as informative leaflet) or Control Group (standardized information and informative leaflet only). Detailed information was given about the indication, the probable complications and the details of the forthcoming procedures (coronary catheters or endoscopy procedures). All participants had to reach a Karnofsky Score of 70 points and be able to understand German or English. Main outcome measures were patient's satisfaction with physician-patient conversation, patient's acquired knowledge and duration of the intervention as described above.  Results: Patients of the Visualization Group were more satisfied with the conversation and had higher knowledge scores after the conversation. A Mann-Whitney-U-Test between the two groups showed that these differences in satisfaction (P  Conclusions: Using computerized visualization increased the satisfaction and knowledge of the patients. The presentation of the visualized information in the Visualization Group did not demand significantly more time than the standard conversation in the Control Group.  KEYWORDS Computer-based visualization; evaluation of visualization; patient empowerment; technology assessment      urlLink Health Attitudes, Health Cognitions, and Health Behaviors among Internet Health Information Seekers: Population-Based Survey   Mohan J. Dutta-Bergman  J Med Internet Res 2004, May, 28; 6(2): e15    Background: Using a functional theory of media use, this paper examines the process of health-information seeking in different domains of Internet use.  Objective: Based on an analysis of the 1999 HealthStyles data, this study was designed to demonstrate that people who gather information on the Internet are more health-oriented than non-users of Internet health information.  Methods: The Porter Novelli HealthStyles database, collected annually since 1995, is based on the results of nationally representative postal mail surveys. In 1999, 2636 respondents provided usable data for the HealthStyles database. Independent sample t-tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted.  Results: The results showed that individuals who searched for health information on the Internet were indeed more likely to be health-oriented than those who did not. Consumers who sought out medical information on the Internet reported higher levels of health-information orientation and healthy activities, as well as stronger health beliefs than those who did not search for medical news on the Internet. It was observed that those who reported searching for information about drugs and medications on the Internet held stronger health beliefs than the non-searchers. Comparison of individuals who reported seeking out information about specific diseases on the Internet with individuals who did not showed those who sought out disease-specific information on the Internet to be more health-oriented. Finally, consumers who sought out healthy lifestyle information on the Internet were more health conscious and more health-information oriented than those who did not. They were also more likely to hold stronger health-oriented beliefs and to engage in healthy activities.  Conclusions: The results support the functional theory of Internet use. Internet searchers who used the Internet for a wide range of health purposes were typically more health oriented than non-searchers.  KEYWORDS Internet; health beliefs; health consciousness; consumers; information seeking; functional approach      urlLink Web Content Accessibility of Consumer Health Information Web Sites for People with Disabilities: A Cross Sectional Evaluation    Xiaoming Zeng, Bambang Parmanto   J Med Internet Res 2004, June, 21; 6(2): e19   Background: The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an increasingly essential resource for health information consumers. The ability to obtain accurate medical information online quickly, conveniently and privately provides health consumers with the opportunity to make informed decisions and participate actively in their personal care. Little is known, however, about whether the content of this online health information is equally accessible to people with disabilities who must rely on special devices or technologies to process online information due to their visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive limitations.  Objective: To construct a framework for an automated Web accessibility evaluation; to evaluate the state of accessibility of consumer health information Web sites; and to investigate the possible relationships between accessibility and other features of the Web sites, including function, popularity and importance.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study of the state of accessibility of health information Web sites to people with disabilities. We selected 108 consumer health information Web sites from the directory service of a Web search engine. A measurement framework was constructed to automatically measure the level of Web Accessibility Barriers (WAB) of Web sites following Web accessibility specifications. We investigated whether there was a difference between WAB scores across various functional categories of the Web sites, and also evaluated the correlation between the WAB and Alexa traffic rank and Google Page Rank of the Web sites.  Results: We found that none of the Web sites we looked at are completely accessible to people with disabilities, i.e., there were no sites that had no violation of Web accessibility rules. However, governmental and educational health information Web sites do exhibit better Web accessibility than the other categories of Web sites (P   Conclusions: Evaluation of health information Web sites shows that no Web site scrupulously abides by Web accessibility specifications, even for entities mandated under relevant laws and regulations. Government and education Web sites show better performance than Web sites among other categories. Accessibility of a Web site may have a positive impact on its popularity in general. However, the Web accessibility of a Web site may not have a significant relationship with its importance on the Web.

A Description of Children's Hospital Web Sites   Terry Kind, Kathryn L. Wheeler, Byanqa Robinson, Michael D. Cabana  J Med Internet Res 2004, June, 25; 6(2): e20   Background: Although leading children's hospitals are recognized as preeminent in the provision of health care to children, the quality of their Web sites has not been described. Objective: To describe technical characteristics of the Web sites of leading children's hospitals.  Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive infodemiology study. Two reviewers independently reviewed and analyzed the Web sites of 26 nationally prominent children's hospitals in June 2003, using objective criteria based on accessibility (based on age and language), attribution, completeness, credibility, currency, disclosure, readability, and other technical elements.  Results: One-third of Web sites included content for children and adolescents. Twenty-four (92%) of the Web sites had health and disease-specific information. One-third contained only English, while two-thirds included other languages. All 26 Web sites included a disclaimer, although none had a requirement to read the disclaimer before accessing health and disease specific information. Twenty-four (92%) had search options. Although most (85%) listed a copyright date, only 10% listed the date last updated.  Conclusions: This is the first study to examine the Web sites of leading children's hospitals. Although the Web sites were designed for children's hospitals, only a few sites included content for children and adolescents. Primary care physicians who refer patients to these sites should be aware that many have limited content for children, and should assess them for other limitations, such as inconsistent documentation of disclaimers or failure to show the date of the last Web site update. These Web sites are a potentially useful source of patient information. However, as the public increasingly looks to the Internet for health information, children's hospitals need to keep up with increasingly high standards and demands of health-care consumers.  KEYWORDS World Wide Web; Internet; children's hospitals; hospitals; pediatric; health information; quality; quality indicators; health care      urlLink Efficacy of Quality Criteria to Identify Potentially Harmful Information: A Cross-sectional Survey of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Web Sites   Muhammad Walji, Smitha Sagaram,  Deepak Sagaram,  Funda Meric-Bernstam,  Craig Johnson, Nadeem Q Mirza,  Elmer V Bernstam  J Med Internet Res 2004, June, 29; 6(2): e21   Background: Many users search the Internet for answers to health questions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a particularly common search topic. Because many CAM therapies do not require a clinician's prescription, false or misleading CAM information may be more dangerous than information about traditional therapies. Many quality criteria have been suggested to filter out potentially harmful online health information. However, assessing the accuracy of CAM information is uniquely challenging since CAM is generally not supported by conventional literature.  Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether domain-independent technical quality criteria can identify potentially harmful online CAM content.  Methods: We analyzed 150 Web sites retrieved from a search for the three most popular herbs: ginseng, ginkgo and St. John's wort and their purported uses on the ten most commonly used search engines. The presence of technical quality criteria as well as potentially harmful statements (commissions) and vital information that should have been mentioned (omissions) was recorded.  Results: Thirty-eight sites (25%) contained statements that could lead to direct physical harm if acted upon. One hundred forty five sites (97%) had omitted information. We found no relationship between technical quality criteria and potentially harmful information.  Conclusions: Current technical quality criteria do not identify potentially harmful CAM information online. Consumers should be warned to use other means of validation or to trust only known sites. Quality criteria that consider the uniqueness of CAM must be developed and validated.

Susan H Swartz,  Timothy M Cowan,  Ida A Batista  Background: Practice-based Internet communication allows patients to obtain health information, ask questions, and submit requests through a personalized Web site. While such online tools also bring great promise for educating patients with the goal of fostering behavior change, it is important to examine how individuals currently using such services differ from those who do not.  Objective: The study used administrative information to characterize a population of patients communicating with a medical practice through the Internet during the end of 1999 and through 2000.  Methods: Patient claims data generated during clinical encounters from January 1999 through May 2000 were examined to measure the relationship between patient demographics, frequency of visits, specific acute diagnoses, and specific chronic diagnoses and the use of online communication with the practice.  Results: Ten percent of patients, and 13.2% of patients 18 years or older, used the practice Web site. There were differences in use of the practice Web site by age and insurance status, but not by gender. Use of the practice Web site was similar or higher among patients having a diagnosis for a variety of acute and chronic conditions compared to those not having such a diagnosis. Patients with more clinic visits were more likely to use the Web-based service.  Conclusions: Patients using practice-based Internet communication and having significant health risks can be identified through the use of administrative data, presenting an opportunity to test online educational efforts to improve health.  KEYWORDS Internet; ambulatory care; primary health care; claims analysis; outpatients; ICD codes; ICD-9; chronic disease; communication; patient education      urlLink Online Consumer Surveys as a Methodology for Assessing the Quality of the United States Health Care System   Christina Bethell,  John Fiorillo,  David Lansky,  Michael Hendryx,  James Knickman  Background: Interest in monitoring the quality of health care in the United States has increased in recent years. However, the policy objectives associated with collecting this information are constrained by the limited availability of timely and relevant data at a reasonable cost. Online data-collection technologies hold the promise of gathering data directly and inexpensively from large, representative samples of patients and consumers. These new information technologies also permit efficient, real-time assessment in such areas as health status, access to care, and other aspects of the care experience that impact health outcomes.  Objective: This study investigates the feasibility, validity, and generalizability of consumer online surveys to measure key aspects of health care quality in the United States.  Methods: Surveys about the health and health care experiences of a general adult population and of adults with diabetes were administered online and by telephone. The online survey drew from a sample frame of nearly 1 million consumers and used a single e-mail notification. The random-digit-dial methodology included 6 follow-up calls. Results from the online sample were compared to the telephone sample and to national benchmark data.  Results: Survey responses about quality of care collected using online and telephone methods were commensurate once they were weighted to represent the demographic distribution of the 2000 United States Census. Expected variations in health and health care quality across demographic and socioeconomic groups were largely observed, as were hypothesized associations among quality indicators and other variables. Fewer individuals were required to be contacted to achieve target sample sizes using online versus telephone methods. Neither method yielded representative cohorts of nonwhite individuals.  Conclusions: Conclusions about the level and variations in health care quality in the United States are similar using data collected in this study compared to data collected using other telephone-based survey methods. As is typical for national telephone surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, stratified sampling and weighting of survey responses is necessary for results to be generalizable. Online methods are more appropriate for understanding health care quality than for conducting epidemiologic assessments of health in the United States.  KEYWORDS Quality of health care; data collection; Internet; health care surveys; consumers      urlLink A Multimedia Interactive Education System for Prostate Cancer Patients:  Development and Preliminary Evaluation   Michael A Diefenbach, Brian P Butz  Background: A cancer diagnosis is highly distressing. Yet, to make informed treatment choices patients have to learn complicated disease and treatment information that is often fraught with medical and statistical terminology. Thus, patients need accurate and easy-to-understand information.  Objective: To introduce the development and preliminary evaluation through focus groups of a novel highly-interactive multimedia-education software program for patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.  Methods: The prostate interactive education system uses the metaphor of rooms in a virtual health center (ie, reception area, a library, physician offices, group meeting room) to organize information. Text information contained in the library is tailored to a person’s information-seeking preference (ie, high versus low information seeker). We conducted a preliminary evaluation through 5 separate focus groups with prostate cancer survivors (N = 18) and their spouses (N = 15).  Results: Focus group results point to the timeliness and high acceptability of the software among the target audience. Results also underscore the importance of a guide or tutor who assists in navigating the program and who responds to queries to facilitate information retrieval.  Conclusions: Focus groups have established the validity of our approach and point to new directions to further enhance the user interface.  KEYWORDS Multimedia software; multimedia; software; prostate cancer; patient education; treatment decision making; treatment; decision making                      urlLink DietPal: A Web-Based Dietary Menu-Generating and Management System   Shahrul A Noah, Siti Norulhuda Abdullah, Suzana Shahar, Helmi Abdul-Hamid, Nurkahirizan Khairudin, Mohamed Yusoff, Rafidah Ghazali, Nooraini Mohd-Yusoff, Nik Shanita Shafii, Zaharah Abdul-Manaf  Background: Attempts in current health care practice to make health care more accessible, effective, and efficient through the use of information technology could include implementation of computer-based dietary menu generation. While several of such systems already exist, their focus is mainly to assist healthy individuals calculate their calorie intake and to help monitor the selection of menus based upon a prespecified calorie value. Although these prove to be helpful in some ways, they are not suitable for monitoring, planning, and managing patients’ dietary needs and requirements. This paper presents a Web-based application that simulates the process of menu suggestions according to a standard practice employed by dietitians.  Objective: To model the workflow of dietitians and to develop, based on this workflow, a Web-based system for dietary menu generation and management. The system is aimed to be used by dietitians or by medical professionals of health centers in rural areas where there are no designated qualified dietitians.  Methods: First, a user-needs study was conducted among dietitians in Malaysia. The first survey of 93 dietitians (with 52 responding) was an assessment of information needed for dietary management and evaluation of compliance towards a dietary regime. The second study consisted of ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews with 14 dietitians in order to identify the workflow of a menu-suggestion process. We subsequently designed and developed a Web-based dietary menu generation and management system called DietPal. DietPal has the capability of automatically calculating the nutrient and calorie intake of each patient based on the dietary recall as well as generating suitable diet and menu plans according to the calorie and nutrient requirement of the patient, calculated from anthropometric measurements. The system also allows reusing stored or predefined menus for other patients with similar health and nutrient requirements.  Results: We modeled the workflow of menu-suggestion activity currently adhered to by dietitians in Malaysia. Based on this workflow, a Web-based system was developed. Initial post evaluation among 10 dietitians indicates that they are comfortable with the organization of the modules and information.  Conclusions: The system has the potential of enhancing the quality of services with the provision of standard and healthy menu plans and at the same time increasing outreach, particularly to rural areas. With its potential capability of optimizing the time spent by dietitians to plan suitable menus, more quality time could be spent delivering nutrition education to the patients.

Clinicians, policy makers, and parents need to better understand the Internet and factors related to positive and negative experiences online.  Objective: Primarily to investigate the association between youth-reported depressive symptomatology and unwanted Internet sexual solicitation and secondarily to identify sex differences in related characteristics of affected youth.  Methods: Data from the Youth Internet Safety Survey were analyzed to investigate the association between reported depressive symptomatology and unwanted Internet sexual solicitation. The Youth Internet Safety Survey was a nationally-representative, cross-sectional telephone survey. Youth participants (N = 1501) were English speakers between the ages of 10 and 17 years who had accessed the Internet at least 6 times in the previous 6 months and had resided in the household for at least 2 weeks in the previous year. Eighty-two percent of contacted households agreed to participate.Each participant was asked to indicate whether any of the 9 symptoms of major depression defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) had been present within the previous month. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of reporting an unwanted sexual solicitation online for youths with mild or major depressive symptomatology versus no symptomatology. A parsimonious, multivariate model of significant youth characteristics was identified separately for males and females.  Results: Youths who report major depressive-like symptoms were 3.5 times more likely (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 2.19-5.71) to also report an unwanted sexual solicitation online compared to youths with mild/no symptomatology. After adjusting for significant Internet and psychosocial characteristics, male Internet users who report major depressive-like symptomatology were 2.5 times more likely to also indicate an unwanted Internet solicitation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.15-6.40); significant differences were not observed among otherwise-similar females. Further, among youths reporting an Internet solicitation (N = 283), youths with major depressive-like symptomatology were twice as likely to report feeling emotionally distressed by the incident compared to youths with mild/no symptomatology (odds ratio, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.03-5.02).  Conclusions: While the majority of youths report positive experiences online, some youths may be more vulnerable to negative experiences. Cross-sectional results indicate that the report of depressive symptomatology is significantly related to the concurrent report of an unwanted Internet sexual solicitation, especially for young males. Future research should focus on parsing out the temporality of events and identifying additional populations of vulnerable youths online.  KEYWORDS Youth; Internet; depression; sexual solicitation; mental health      urlLink Can Clinical Trials Requiring Frequent Participant Contact Be Conducted Over the Internet?: Results From an Online Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating a Topical Ointment for Herpes Labialis   Margaret Formica,  Karim Kabbara, Rachael Clark,  Tim McAlindon  Background: The Internet has tremendous appeal for conducting randomized clinical trials and may be especially applicable to trials requiring frequent participant contact. Trials of cold sore remedies, for example, often require daily clinic visits during outbreaks, imposing substantial burden on participants. An Internet-based randomized clinical trial design may reduce this burden, permitting frequent symptom reports with considerably less effort.  Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of a Web-based randomized clinical trial requiring frequent participant interaction, using a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial of a topical ointment containing dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) (Zilex; Meditech Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA) intended for treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. A secondary objective was to obtain preliminary data on effectiveness outcomes, to assist in planning a fully-powered trial of DSS.  Methods: Adults with physician-confirmed herpes labialis were recruited to apply to the trial. Eligible applicants were randomized to DSS or placebo, mailed to them upon enrolment with instructions to apply topically every 2 hours for the duration of every cold sore outbreak. Participants were instructed to complete online questionnaires at 2-week intervals and, at the initiation of a cold sore, daily "outbreak questionnaires" until outbreak termination. Feasibility outcome measures included trial participant characteristics, frequency of cold sores, participant retention and adherence (to study medication), and data completeness. Treatment effectiveness outcome measures included outbreak duration, days to crust formation, and pain.  Results: Of the 292 individuals applying, 182 screened eligible; 32 participants with confirmed herpes labialis enrolled in the trial. 16 were randomized into the verum group and 16 into the placebo group. 29 (91%) participants completed the trial. During the trial, 34 outbreaks were reported among 23 (72%) participants, resulting in a cold sore incidence rate of 19.8 per 100 person-months of observation. Online data were available for 32 outbreaks; the absence of a resolution date made it impossible to accurately calculate the duration of 12 (38%) outbreaks. Although the DSS treatment group had a shorter mean outbreak duration (6.6 vs 7.7 days, P = .2) and fewer mean days to crust formation (3.5 vs 4.9, P = .1), these differences did not reach statistical significance. The DSS group has statistically significant lower mean pain scores (3.1 vs 7.6, P = .04), but participants in this group also consumed more acetaminophen tablets than the placebo group (1.1 versus 0.5, P=.55). Adherence to medication was similar in both groups: 7 (50%) of the verum group reported using the cream as directed compared to 6 (46.2%) in the placebo group; (P = .8).  Conclusions: We efficiently recruited participants and achieved high overall retention rates. However, participant adherence to the daily outbreak visit schedules was low and only 7 (50%) participants used the cream as directed. These limitations could be addressed in future Internet-based studies by using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), using reminder devices, and providing incentives. By enhancing participant adherence, clinical trials requiring frequent participant contact may be feasible over the Internet.

However, little is known about how pregnant women and mothers of young children seek and process online pediatric health information.  Objective: To explore why and where mothers of young children look for online health information and how they determine if the information they receive is trustworthy.  Methods: Focus groups were conducted in a Southeastern US city to provide an in-depth exploration of web-related behaviors and beliefs among mothers who work inside and outside of the home. Data from the focus groups were coded using deductive and inductive coding schemes and content was analyzed for the existence of themes.  Results: Twenty mothers of young children participated in four focus groups. Most participants sought information on the Internet during pregnancy and nearly all sought online information after their child was born, primarily to diagnose or treat pediatric conditions and to seek advice on parenting and development. Participants mainly used commercial information websites for health information and many expressed disdain for commercial product websites. Many also expressed concerns about the reliability of health information on the web and described strategies for determining how much they trust each website.  Conclusions: Women appear to be high information seekers during pregnancy and the first few years following delivery, and this period represents an important window of time for providing online health information. Participants suggested that online information sources and motives for providing online information should be clear in order to increase perceptions of trust. Participants expressed preference for online clinical health information that is presented by clinical professionals, and online parenting advice that is presented from other parents.  KEYWORDS Internet; Pediatrics; Focus Groups; Mothers; Health Education      urlLink The Internet as a Vehicle to Communicate Health  Information During a Public Health Emergency:  A Survey Analysis Involving the  Anthrax Scare of 2001   Anne F Kittler, John Hobbs, Lynn A Volk, Gary L Kreps, David W Bates  Background: The recent public health risks arising from bioterrorist threats and outbreaks of infectious diseases like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) highlight the challenges of effectively communicating accurate health information to an alarmed public.  Objective: To evaluate use of the Internet in accessing information related to the anthrax scare in the United States in late 2001, and to strategize about the most effective use of this technology as a communication vehicle during times of public health crises.  Methods: A paper-based survey to assess how individuals obtained health information relating to bioterrorism and anthrax during late 2001.We surveyed 500 randomly selected patients from two ambulatory primary care clinics affiliated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.  Results: The response rate was 42%. While traditional media provided the primary source of information on anthrax and bioterrorism, 21% (95% CI, 15% - 27%) of respondents reported searching the Internet for this information during late 2001. Respondents reported trusting information from physicians the most, and information from health websites slightly more than information from any traditional media source. Over half of those searching the Internet reported changing their behavior as a result of information found online.  Conclusions: Many people already look to the Internet for information during a public health crisis, and information found online can positively influence behavioral responses to such crises. However, the potential of the Internet to convey accurate health information and advice has not yet been realized. In order to enhance the effectiveness of public-health communication, physician practices could use this technology to pro-actively e-mail their patients validated information. Still, unless Internet access becomes more broadly available, its benefits will not accrue to disadvantaged populations.  KEYWORDS bioterrorism; public health; communication; electronic mail; inequality; behavior      urlLink Swiss Community Pharmacies' on the Web and Pharmacists' Experiences with E-commerce: Longitudinal study and Internet-based Questionnaire Survey    Simon Zehnder, Rudolf Bruppacher, Hans Ruppanner, Kurt E Hersberger  Background: There are multiple ways in which community pharmacies can present themselves on the Internet, e.g., as a platform for drug information or as an advertising platform for their services.  Objective: To estimate the number of Swiss community pharmacies on the Internet over the period of 32 months (2000-2003), to describe their current e-commerce services, and to explore the experiences and plans these pharmacies have with regard to their Internet presence.  Methods: A longitudinal study was performed to determine the number of Swiss German pharmacies on the Internet by conducting Internet searches in 2000, 2001, and 2003. In April 2002, a cross-sectional Internet-based survey was administered to explore the pharmacies' experiences and plans regarding their Web sites.  Results: As of April 2003, 373 (44%) of 852 community pharmacies from the German speaking part of Switzerland were on the Internet. One hundred eighty four listed an e-mail address and were asked to complete a questionnaire. Of the 107 pharmacies answering the survey questions (58% response rate): 46% had been on the Internet for 1 to 2 years; 33% of the Web sites are part of a pharmacy group's Web portal; 31% of the pharmacies plan to expand their Internet appearance in the future; 74% provide e-commerce services, with 81% of those pharmacies filling five or less orders per month; and 12% plan on expanding their e-commerce services in the future.  Conclusions: The number of community pharmacies offering Internet services steadily increased over 32 months. Given the importance of the Internet as a tool for information, communication, and advertising for pharmacy products and services, it can be expected that the increase will continue. Pharmacy-group portals are important promoters of pharmacies on the Internet. For many community pharmacies, Internet portals that provide an Internet presence for the pharmacies and provide regularly-updated content (e.g., health news, tips, drug information) seem to be the most effective solutions. Even though 40% of the pharmacies already offer e-commerce services, these services are still of minor importance. For many pharmacists, the current legal regulations seem to be unclear. Most pharmacies want to maintain their Internet services.  KEYWORDS Web site; community pharmacies; professional-patient relations; quality of health care; e-commerce; e-pharmacies; Switzerland      urlLink Pharmacist Computer Skills and Needs Assessment Survey   Robert M Balen, Peter J Jewesson  Background: To use technology effectively for the advancement of patient care, pharmacists must possess a variety of computer skills. We recently introduced a novel applied informatics program in this Canadian hospital clinical service unit to enhance the informatics skills of our members.  Objective: This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the baseline computer skills and needs of our hospital pharmacists immediately prior to the implementation of an applied informatics program.  Methods: In May 2001, an 84-question written survey was distributed by mail to 106 practicing hospital pharmacists in our multi-site, 1500-bed, acute-adult-tertiary care Canadian teaching hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Results: Fifty-eight surveys (55% of total) were returned within the two-week study period. The survey responses reflected the opinions of licensed BSc and PharmD hospital pharmacists with a broad range of pharmacy practice experience. Most respondents had home access to personal computers, and regularly used computers in the work environment for drug distribution, information management, and communication purposes. Few respondents reported experience with handheld computers. Software use experience varied according to application. Although patient-care information software and e-mail were commonly used, experience with spreadsheet, statistical, and presentation software was negligible. The respondents were familiar with Internet search engines, and these were reported to be the most common method of seeking clinical information online. Although many respondents rated themselves as being generally computer literate and not particularly anxious about using computers, the majority believed they required more training to reach their desired level of computer literacy. Lack of familiarity with computer-related terms was prevalent. Self-reported basic computer skill was typically at a moderate level, and varied depending on the task. Specifically, respondents rated their ability to manipulate files, use software help features, and install software as low, but rated their ability to access and navigate the Internet as high. Respondents were generally aware of what online resources were available to them and Clinical Pharmacology was the most commonly employed reference. In terms of anticipated needs, most pharmacists believed they needed to upgrade their computer skills. Medical database and Internet searching skills were identified as those in greatest need of improvement.  Conclusions: Most pharmacists believed they needed to upgrade their computer skills. Medical database and Internet searching skills were identified as those in greatest need of improvement for the purposes of improving practice effectiveness.  KEYWORDS Computer literacy; pharmacy; clinical informatics; needs assessment; pharmacists; survey      urlLink Experience and Attitudes towards Information Technology among First-Year Medical Students in Denmark: Longitudinal Questionnaire Survey    Jens Doerup  Background: As more and more information technology (IT) resources become available both for support of campus- based medical education and for Web-based learning, it becomes increasingly interesting to map the information technology resources available to medical students and the attitudes students have towards their use.  Objective: To determine how extensively and effectively information handling skills are being taught in the medical curriculum, the study investigated Internet and computer availability and usage, and attitudes towards information technology among first-year medical students in Aarhus, Denmark, during a five-year period.  Methods: In the period from 1998 to 2002, students beginning the first semester of medical school were given courses on effective use of IT in their studies. As a part of the tutorials, the students were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire which included questions related to IT readiness and attitudes towards using IT in studies.  Results: A total of 1159 students (78%) responded. Overall, 71.7% of the respondents indicating they had access to a computer at home, a number that did not change significantly during the study period. Over time, the power of students' computers and the use of e-mail and Internet did increase significantly. By fall 2002, approximately 90% of students used e-mail regularly, 80 % used the Internet regularly, and 60 % had access to the Internet from home. Significantly more males than females had access to a computer at home, and males had a more positive attitude towards the use of computers in their medical studies. A fairly constant number of students (3-7 %) stated that they would prefer not to have to use computers in their studies.  Conclusions: Taken together with our experience from classroom teaching, these results indicate optional teaching of basic information technology still needs to be integrated into medical studies, and that this need does not seem likely to disappear in the near future.

        urlLink IJMI Homepage       Patient safety: Remember who it’s really for   Pages 547-550  Patricia Flatley Brennan and Charles Safran   Patients appear in the patient safety agenda in three important places: first and foremost as the individual most likely to experience the positive benefits of good care or negative consequences of unsafe care; second, as surveyors of quality of care indicators; and finally, through their presence as patient representatives on institutional safety committees. However, patient safety programs largely address provider-interests, and many times overlook patient preferences and needs. Active engagement of the patient in all aspects of the patient safety agenda is necessary for its success. Patient safety, then, requires: a comprehensive agenda informed by patient preferences and experiences; an informed and motivated populace; mechanisms integrate safe practices and patient preferences, and investment in safety-enhancing devices and care strategies.      Improving patient safety through informatics tools for shared decision making and risk communication   Pages 551-557  Cornelia M. Ruland   This paper describes how informatics tools can support shared decision making and risk communication and thereby play an important role in enhancing patient safety. Using preference elicitation techniques and knowledge on risk communication, such tools can help patients understand their treatment options and associated short- and long-term benefits and risks, assist in the elicitation of patient preferences, and help patients and clinicians in making treatment choices with the highest likelihood of achieving desired patient outcomes. Important features of such tools are proposed, including: (1) Interactive tutorials to improve risk comprehension and prepare patients and clinicians for the decision making task; (2) choices between different presentation modes to meet patients’ individual reading levels and presentation preferences; (3) risk calculations that account for individual risk profiles; (4) performance of necessary calculations to reach the actual decision; (5) automatic updates of evidence; and (6) the use of different preference-elicitation techniques.   Author Keywords: Informatics tools; Shared decision making; Risk communication; Patient preferences      Managing the three ‘P’s to improve patient safety: nursing administration’s role in managing information technology   Pages 559-561  Roy L. Simpson   The Institute of Medicine’s landmark report asserted that medical error is seldom the fault of individuals, but the result of faulty healthcare policy/procedure systems. Numerous studies have shown that information technology (IT) can shore up weak systems. For nursing, IT plays a key role in eliminating nursing mistakes. However, managing IT is a function of managing the people who use it. For nursing administrators, successful IT implementations depend on adroit management of the three ‘P’s: People, processes and (computer) programs. This paper examines critical issues for managing each entity. It discusses the importance of developing trusting organizations, the requirements of process change, how to implement technology in harmony with the organization and the significance of vision.   Author Keywords: Nursing administration; Medical error; Patient safety; Information technology      Patient safety initiatives in Brazil: a nursing perspective   Pages 563-567  M. L. G. Pedreira and H. F. Marin   The science development and technology application improvement in all areas of knowledge, including health care, represent an advance in patient care. The health care providers face challenges to accomplish complex procedures and treatments, which demand infrastructure, defined framework, constant process establishment and redesign of nursing care, based on a continuous outcomes evaluation. Therefore, this development requires nurses with advanced knowledge and skills. As the main health care provider in Brazilian hospitals, the nursing staff perform and control the majority of direct patient care procedures, and as such, nursing professionals can be responsible for triggering adverse events that can compromise patient safety. Research conducted in Brazil showed that the quality of health care delivery system and the results of care have significant variation nationwide. Health care professionals should be valued as the one who can promote patient safety, providing high quality care within cost-effective services. Technology is a key element to support and enhance the professional’s performance. However, it is also important to promote and facilitate its implementation and development to retain a creative, engaged, skilled, satisfied, competent, and accountable professional capable of identifying and using technology resources in order to assure the quality of care for the population.   Author Keywords: Nursing; Medication errors; Health care quality, access, and evaluation; Safety; Information science      Challenging the information gap – the patients transfer from hospital to home health care   Pages 569-580  Ragnhild Hellesø, Margarethe Lorensen and Lena Sorensen   The purpose of this paper is to identify the information that nurses in hospitals exchange with nurses in home health care (HHC), and what nurses perceive to be the most significant information to exchange. Method: Nurses have an obligation to support and ensure continuity of patient care and to prevent an information gap when patients are transferred from one organizational of health care delivery to another organizational level, for example, from hospital to home health care. In an ongoing prospective study, nurses’ pre-electronic nursing discharge note and their assessment of the information it was necessary to exchange at the same time was audited and analyzed.   The results show variation in the completeness and content of the nursing discharge note. Nurses’ understanding of the scope and content of information to be transmitted varies widely according to the context and the organizational health care level they work within.   The implementation of an electronic nursing discharge note creates the opportunity to identify the accurate information elements that must be documented and exchanged between the nurses to ensure patient safety and inter-organizational continuity of care.

Ted Klein, Jossie Paguntalan, W. Dan Roberts and Michael Soupios   The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in America identified the critical role of information technology in designing safe and effective health care. In addition to technical aspects such as regional or national health information infrastructures, to achieve this goal, healthcare professionals must receive the requisite training during basic and advanced educational programs. In this article, we describe a two-pronged strategy to promote patient safety through an informatics-based approach to nursing education at the Columbia University School of Nursing: (1) use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) to document clinical encounters and to retrieve patient safety-related information at the point of care, and (2) enhancement of informatics competencies of students and faculty. These approaches may be useful to others wishing to promote patient safety through using informatics methods and technologies in healthcare curricula.

Grobe   Redefinition of roles and functions in the healthcare systems of the future requires embracing to the value of continuing education. Within this framework healthcare professional education and continuing education, there are several core competencies described by Institute of Medicine (IOM) [A.C. Greiner, E. Knebel (Eds.), Health Professionals Education: Bridge to Quality, IOM, available at  urlLink http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10681.html , May 2003] that form the foundation for practice for nurses and other healthcare professionals. An overarching sentence in the document says "All health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics" (p. 45). These IOM core competencies are:   (1) Common value for respecting patients’ differences, values, preferences and expressed needs.  (2) Ability to cooperate, collaborate, communicate and integrate care using interdisciplinary teams.  (3) Knowledge of and willingness to employ evidence-based practice principles.  (4) Capability to apply quality and safety improvement approaches in care.  (5) Understand, value and use informatics to all areas of health care, to reduce errors, manage knowledge and information, and make decisions and communicate.   In enveloping these core competencies in basic and continuing education, it is necessary to build an evidence base for education itself, demand that faculty are prepared for the future. A crucial need is for healthcare professional students (including nursing students) learn interdisciplinary collaboration in the education of patients. A global strategy, using these competencies for preparing faculty is necessary; and some models already exist that can be further developed to meet future needs that are informatics driven in our increasingly technological future care systems.

If the degree of anonymity of a disseminated data set could be measured, it would be possible to design algorithms that can assure that the desired level of confidentiality is achieved. Privacy protection in disseminated databases can be facilitated by the use of special ambiguation algorithms. Most of these algorithms are aimed at making one individual indistinguishable from one or more of his peers. However, even in databases considered "anonymous", it may still be possible to obtain sensitive information about some individuals or groups of individuals with the use of pattern recognition algorithms. In this article, we study the problem of determining the degree of ambiguation in disseminated databases and discuss its implications in the development and testing of "anonymization" algorithms.

G. Pedreira, Abel Paiva, William Goossen and David W. Bates   When people become patients, they place their trust in their health care providers. As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment, patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority. Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.

Design: Develop a process for document development, review, and approval that includes best evidence from research and input from clinical experts. Results: After six years of development, the electronic reference InfoBase (a searchable online reference manual which provides easy access to standards for clinical practice throughout the organization) contains over 700 interdisciplinary patient care standards (e.g., protocols, procedures, standards of care) and over 1000 "information chunks" (e.g., assessments, instructions, scales, tables, graphics) that support consistency in care delivery. All documents have been written, based on the best evidence available from research and reviewed by a group of clinicians at IHC facilities and approved for use throughout the company. An example of how standardization of interdisciplinary standards can improve patient safety in the area of falls is also included.

Rocha   Aim: Develop a compositional terminology model for nursing orders that would conform to the existing standard health level seven (HL7) messaging standard for clinical orders. Develop and evaluate the set of attributes needed for a pre-coordinated concept for a single nursing order, using a replicable three-step modeling process. Results: A terminology model for nursing orders was developed using empirical data. The model was validated against nursing research and standards literature, and evaluated using 609 nursing orders that were successfully mapped to the structure. The representative services came from 20 Intermountain Health Care (IHC) hospitals, demonstrating the generalizability of the model and its attributes across many care settings.

Mendonça, Elizabeth S. Chen, Peter D. Stetson, Lawrence K. McKnight, Jianbo Lei and James J. Cimino   Evidence suggests that inadequate access to information and ineffective communication are proximal causes of errors and other adverse events in-patient care. Within the context of reducing these proximal causes of errors, we explore the use of novel information-based approaches to improve information access and communication in health care settings. This paper describes the approaches for and the design of extensions to a clinical information system used to improve information access and communication at the point of care using information-based handheld wireless applications. These extensions include clinical and information resources, event monitoring, and a virtual whiteboard (VWB).

Roemer, Stephanie J. Richardson, Roberto A. Rocha, Guilherme Del Fiol and Richard L. Bradshaw   A computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system can provide an efficient means of retrieving and consolidating order lists from multiple electronic clinical practice standards and protocols. However, the consolidated order list may contain exact duplicate or overlapping orders. Benner’s framework for levels of nursing expertise can be used to explicate the variability of the nurse’s responses to redundancies in order lists and the potential compromise to patient safety. An exploratory case method was performed to consolidate 74 orders from 11 sources. The consolidated order list contained 35% fewer orders after the redundant orders were removed. Our work has shown that many redundant orders may arise by consolidating order lists from multiple electronic standards. It is imperative that consolidated electronic order lists be manageable by the nurse according to their level of clinical and computer expertise, and that redundant orders are resolved before being displayed to the nurse.

S. Ortega and Abelardo de Q. -C. Araújo   Measures of functional levels, commonly used to assess the safety and quality of life of individuals and populations, have not yet been derived from a fuzzy framework. The aim of this study is to estimate the degree of disability associated with varying functional levels, through a model based on fuzzy sets theory. A fuzzy linguistic model was developed to measure varying levels of functional disability, in accordance with the definitions of an individual’s social and physical activities and mobility. One year of an adult’s life whose mobility, social and physical activities were somewhat limited, was judged to be equivalent to 0.575 years free of functional disability. Results obtained from the fuzzy model approach those obtained with the quality of well-being scale (QWB), used as a conceptual framework. Such findings are encouraging, since the QWB is considered a consistent and valid approach for disability assessment and quality-of-life evaluation.

Newbold, Gilad J. Kuperman, Suzanne Bakken, Patricia Flatley Brennan, Eneida A. Mendonca, Hyeoun-Ae Park and Aleksandar Radenovic   This article describes the process utilized to create research questions which promote technology as an infrastructure to enable safe nursing practice. Beginning with scenarios of safety problems related to nursing practice, the team identified information technology including hardware, software, and organizational and operational components to help improve the safety aspects addressed in the scenarios. Further discussed are characteristics of technology necessary at each step in the nursing process and finally recommendations are presented for various research questions that would be needed to enable research on the use of the proposed technologies.

       Annals of Internal Medicine: 1 June 2004, Volume 140 Issue 11, Pages 910-922  (Dena M. Bravata, MD, MS; Kathryn M. McDonald, MM; Wendy M. Smith, BA; Chara Rydzak, BA; Herbert Szeto, MD, MS, MPH; David L. Buckeridge, MD, MSc; Corinna Haberland, MD;  and Douglas K. Owens, MD, MS)  Background:  Given the threat of bioterrorism and the increasing availability of electronic data for surveillance, surveillance systems for the early detection of illnesses and syndromes potentially related to bioterrorism have proliferated.  Purpose: To critically evaluate the potential utility of existing surveillance systems for illnesses and syndromes related to bioterrorism.  Data Sources: Databases of peer-reviewed articles (for example, MEDLINE for articles published from January 1985 to April 2002) and Web sites of relevant government and nongovernment agencies.  Study Selection: Reports that described or evaluated systems for collecting, analyzing, or presenting surveillance data for bioterrorism-related illnesses or syndromes.  Data Extraction: From each included article, the authors abstracted information about the type of surveillance data collected; method of collection, analysis, and presentation of surveillance data; and outcomes of evaluations of the system.  Data Synthesis: 17 510 article citations and 8088 government and nongovernmental Web sites were reviewed. From these, the authors included 115 systems that collect various surveillance reports, including 9 syndromic surveillance systems, 20 systems collecting bioterrorism detector data, 13 systems collecting influenza-related data, and 23 systems collecting laboratory and antimicrobial resistance data. Only the systems collecting syndromic surveillance data and detection system data were designed, at least in part, for bioterrorism preparedness applications. Syndromic surveillance systems have been deployed for both event-based and continuous bioterrorism surveillance. Few surveillance systems have been comprehensively evaluated. Only 3 systems have had both sensitivity and specificity evaluated.  Limitations: Data from some existing surveillance systems (particularly those developed by the military) may not be publicly available.  Conclusions: Few surveillance systems have been specifically designed for collecting and analyzing data for the early detection of a bioterrorist event. Because current evaluations of surveillance systems for detecting bioterrorism and emerging infections are insufficient to characterize the timeliness or sensitivity and specificity, clinical and public health decision making based on these systems may be compromised.   urlLink FULL TEXT

Journal of General Internal Medicine.  2001 July;16(7):435-45  Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA. dhgustaf@facstaff.wisc.edu  OBJECTIVE: Assess impact of a computer-based patient support system on quality of life in younger women with breast cancer, with particular emphasis on assisting the underserved. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted between 1995 and 1998. SETTING: Five sites: two teaching hospitals (Madison, Wis, and Chicago, Ill), two nonteaching hospitals (Chicago), and a cancer resource center (Indianapolis, Ill). The latter three sites treat many underserved patients. PARTICIPANTS: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (N = 246) under age 60. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental group received Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS), a home-based computer system providing information, decision-making, and emotional support. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pretest and two post-test surveys (at two- and five-month follow-up) measured aspects of participation in care, social/information support, and quality of life. At two-month follow-up, the CHESS group was significantly more competent at seeking information, more comfortable participating in care, and had greater confidence in doctor(s). At five-month follow-up, the CHESS group had significantly better social support and also greater information competence. In addition, experimental assignment interacted with several indicators of medical underservice (race, education, and lack of insurance), such that CHESS benefits were greater for the disadvantaged than the advantaged group. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-based patient support systems such as CHESS may benefit patients by providing information and social support, and increasing their participation in health care. These benefits may be largest for currently underserved populations.

          Some methods for blindfolded record linkage  (Tim Churches  and Peter Christen)  Background  The linkage of records which refer to the same entity in separate data collections is a common requirement in public health and biomedical research. Traditionally, record linkage techniques have required that all the identifying data in which links are sought be revealed to at least one party, often a third party. This necessarily invades personal privacy and requires complete trust in the intentions of that party and their ability to maintain security and confidentiality. Dusserre, Quantin, Bouzelat and colleagues have demonstrated that it is possible to use secure one-way hash transformations to carry out follow-up epidemiological studies without any party having to reveal identifying information about any of the subjects - a technique which we refer to as "blindfolded record linkage". A limitation of their method is that only exact comparisons of values are possible, although phonetic encoding of names and other strings can be used to allow for some types of typographical variation and data errors.  Methods  A method is described which permits the calculation of a general similarity measure, the n-gram score, without having to reveal the data being compared, albeit at some cost in computation and data communication. This method can be combined with public key cryptography and automatic estimation of linkage model parameters to create an overall system for blindfolded record linkage.  Results  The system described offers good protection against misdeeds or security failures by any one party, but remains vulnerable to collusion between or simultaneous compromise of two or more parties involved in the linkage operation. In order to reduce the likelihood of this, the use of last-minute allocation of tasks to substitutable servers is proposed. Proof-of-concept computer programmes written in the Python programming language are provided to illustrate the similarity comparison protocol.  Conclusion  Although the protocols described in this paper are not unconditionally secure, they do suggest the feasibility, with the aid of modern cryptographic techniques and high speed communication networks, of a general purpose probabilistic record linkage system which permits record linkage studies to be carried out with negligible risk of invasion of personal privacy.     Resources for comparing the speed and performance of medical autocoders  (Jules J Berman)  Background  Concept indexing is a popular method for characterizing medical text, and is one of the most important early steps in many data mining efforts. Concept indexing differs from simple word or phrase indexing because concepts are typically represented by a nomenclature code that binds a medical concept to all equivalent representations. A concept search on the term renal cell carcinoma would be expected to find occurrences of hypernephroma, and renal carcinoma (concept equivalents). The purpose of this study is to provide freely available resources to compare speed and performance among different autocoders. These tools consist of: 1) a public domain autocoder written in Perl (a free and open source programming language that installs on any operating system); 2) a nomenclature database derived from the unencumbered subset of the publicly available Unified Medical Language System; 3) a large corpus of autocoded output derived from a publicly available medical text.  Methods  A simple lexical autocoder was written that parses plain-text into a listing of all 1,2,3, and 4-word strings contained in text, assigning a nomenclature code for text strings that match terms in the nomenclature. The nomenclature used is the unencumbered subset of the 2003 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The unencumbered subset of UMLS was reduced to exclude homonymous one-word terms and proper names, resulting in a term/code data dictionary containing about a half million medical terms. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a 92+ Megabyte publicly available medical opus, was used as sample medical text for the autocoder.  Results  The autocoding Perl script is remarkably short, consisting of just 38 command lines. The 92+ Megabyte OMIM file was completely autocoded in 869 seconds on a 2.4 GHz processor (less than 10 seconds per Megabyte of text). The autocoded output file (9,540,442 bytes) contains 367,963 coded terms from OMIM and is distributed with this manuscript.  Conclusions  A public domain Perl script is provided that can parse through plain-text files of any length, matching concepts against an external nomenclature. The script and associated files can be used freely to compare the speed and performance of autocoding software.    A Wireless Health Outcomes Monitoring System (WHOMS): development and field testing with cancer patients using mobile phones  (Emilia Bielli, Fabio Carminati, Stella La Capra, Micaela Lina, Cinzia Brunelli  and Marcello Tamburini)  Background  Health-Related Quality of Life assessment is widely used in clinical research, but rarely in clinical practice. Barriers including practical difficulties administering printed questionnaires have limited their use. Telehealth technology could reduce these barriers and encourage better doctor-patient interaction regarding patient symptoms and quality-of-life monitoring. The aim of this study was to develop a new system for transmitting patients' self-reported outcomes using mobile phones or the internet, and to test whether patients can and will use the system via a mobile phone.  Methods  We have developed a prototype of a Wireless Health Outcomes Monitoring System, which allows structured questionnaires to be sent to the patient by their medical management team. The patients' answers are directly sent to an authorised website immediately accessible by the medical team, and are displayed in a graphic format that highlights the patient's state of health. In the present study, 97 cancer inpatients were asked to complete a ten-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was delivered by display on a mobile phone, and was answered by the patients using the mobile phone keypad.  Results  Of the 97 patients, 56 (58%) attempted the questionnaire, and all of these 56 completed it. Only 6% of the total number of questions were left unanswered by patients. Forty-one (42%) patients refused to participate, mostly due to their lack of familiarity with mobile phone use. Compared with those who completed the questionnaire, patients who refused to participate were older, had fewer years of education and were less familiar with new communications technology (mobile phone calls, mobile phone SMS, internet, email).  Conclusion  More than half of the patients self-completed the questionnaire using the mobile phone. This proportion may increase with the use of multichannel communications which can be incorporated into the system. The proportion may also increase if the patient's partner and/or family were able to assist the patient with using the technology. These preliminary results encourage further studies to identify specific diseases or circumstances where this system could be useful in patients' distance monitoring. Such a system is likely to detect patient suffering earlier, and to activate a well-timed intervention.    Description and validation of a Markov model of survival for individuals free of cardiovascular disease that uses Framingham risk factors  (Chris Martin, Mark Vanderpump,  and Joyce French)  Background  Estimation of cardiovascular disease risk is increasingly used to inform decisions on interventions, such as the use of antihypertensives and statins, or to communicate the risks of smoking. Crude 10-year cardiovascular disease risk risks may not give a realistic view of the likely impact of an intervention over a lifetime and will underestimate of the risks of smoking. A validated model of survival to act as a decision aid in the consultation may help to address these problems. This study aims to describe the development of such a model for use with people free of cardiovascular disease and evaluates its accuracy against data from a United Kingdom cohort.  Methods  A Markov cycle tree evaluated using cohort simulation was developed utilizing Framingham estimates of cardiovascular risk, 1998 United Kingdom mortality data, the relative risk for smoking related non-cardiovascular disease risk and changes in systolic blood pressure and serum total cholesterol total cholesterol with age. The model's estimates of survival at 20 years for 1391 members of the Whickham survey cohort between the ages of 35 and 65 were compared with the observed survival at 20-year follow-up.  Results  The model estimate for survival was 75% and the observed survival was 75.4%. The correlation between estimated and observed survival was 0.933 over 39 subgroups of the cohort stratified by estimated survival, 0.992 for the seven 5-year age bands from 35 to 64, 0.936 for the ten 10 mmHg systolic blood pressure bands between 100 mmHg and 200 mmHg, and 0.693 for the fifteen 0.5 mmol/l total cholesterol bands between 3.0 and 10.0 mmol/l. The model significantly underestimated mortality in those people with a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mmHg (p = 0.006).  The average gain in life expectancy from the elimination of cardiovascular disease risk as a cause of death was 4.0 years for all the 35 year-old men in the sample (n = 24), and 1.8 years for all the 35 year-old women in the sample (n = 32).  Conclusions  This model accurately estimates 20-year survival in subjects from the Whickham cohort with a systolic blood pressure below 180 mmHg.    Estimation of hospital emergency room data using otc pharmaceutical sales and least mean square filters  (AH Najmi  and SF Magruder)  Background  Surveillance of Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical (OTC) sales as a potential early indicator of developing public health conditions, in particular in cases of interest to Bioterrorism, has been suggested in the literature. The data streams of interest are quite non-stationary and we address this problem from the viewpoint of linear adaptive filter theory: the clinical data is the primary channel which is to be estimated from the OTC data that form the reference channels.  Method  The OTC data are grouped into a few categories and we estimate the clinical data using each individual category, as well as using a multichannel filter that encompasses all the OTC categories. The estimation (in the least mean square sense) is performed using an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter and the normalized LMS algorithm.  Results  We show all estimation results and present a table of effectiveness of each OTC category, as well as the effectiveness of the combined filtering operation. Individual group results clearly show the effectiveness of each particular group in estimating the clinical hospital data and serve as a guide as to which groups have sustained correlations with the clinical data.  Conclusion  Our results indicate that Multichannle adaptive FIR least squares filtering is a viable means of estimating public health conditions from OTC sales, and provide quantitative measures of time dependent correlations between the clinical data and the OTC data channels.    Characterization of digital medical images utilizing support vector machines  (Ilias G Maglogiannis  and Elias P Zafiropoulos)  Background  In this paper we discuss an efficient methodology for the image analysis and characterization of digital images containing skin lesions using Support Vector Machines and present the results of a preliminary study.  Methods  The methodology is based on the support vector machines algorithm for data classification and it has been applied to the problem of the recognition of malignant melanoma versus dysplastic naevus. Border and colour based features were extracted from digital images of skin lesions acquired under reproducible conditions, using basic image processing techniques. Two alternative classification methods, the statistical discriminant analysis and the application of neural networks were also applied to the same problem and the results are compared.  Results  The SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithm performed quite well achieving 94.1% correct classification, which is better than the performance of the other two classification methodologies. The method of discriminant analysis classified correctly 88% of cases (71% of Malignant Melanoma and 100% of Dysplastic Naevi), while the neural networks performed approximately the same.  Conclusion  The use of a computer-based system, like the one described in this paper, is intended to avoid human subjectivity and to perform specific tasks according to a number of criteria. However the presence of an expert dermatologist is considered necessary for the overall visual assessment of the skin lesion and the final diagnosis.    Monitoring of IVF birth outcomes in Finland: a data quality study  (Mika Gissler, Reija Klemetti, Tiina Sev&oacute;n,  and Elina Hemminki)  Background  The collection of information on infertility treatments is important for the surveillance of potential health consequences and to monitor service provision.  Study design  We compared the coverage and outcomes of IVF children reported in aggregated IVF statistics, the Medical Birth Register (subsequently: MBR) and research data based on reimbursements for IVF treatments in Finland in 1996&#8211;1998.  Results  The number of newborns were nearly equal in the three data sources (N = 4331&#8211;4384), but the linkage between the MBR and the research data revealed that almost 40% of the reported IVF children were not the same individuals. The perinatal outcomes in the three data sources were similar, excluding the much lower incidence of major congenital anomalies in the IVF statistics (157/10 000 newborns) compared to other sources (409&#8211;422/10 000 newborns).  Conclusion  The differences in perinatal outcomes in the three data sets were in general minor, which suggests that the observed non-recording in the MBR is most likely unbiased.    Coupling computer-interpretable guidelines with a drug-database through a web-based system &#8211; The PRESGUID project  (Jean-Charles Dufour, Dominique Fieschi, and Marius Fieschi)  Background  Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) available today are not extensively used due to lack of proper integration into clinical settings, knowledge-related information resources, and lack of decision support at the point of care in a particular clinical context.  Objective  The PRESGUID project (PREScription and GUIDelines) aims to improve the assistance provided by guidelines. The project proposes an online service enabling physicians to consult computerized CPGs linked to drug databases for easier integration into the healthcare process.  Methods  Computable CPGs are structured as decision trees and coded in XML format. Recommendations related to drug classes are tagged with ATC codes. We use a mapping module to enhance computerized guidelines coupling with a drug database, which contains detailed information about each usable specific medication. In this way, therapeutic recommendations are backed up with current and up-to-date information from the database.  Results  Two authoritative CPGs, originally diffused as static textual documents, have been implemented to validate the computerization process and to illustrate the usefulness of the resulting automated CPGs and their coupling with a drug database. We discuss the advantages of this approach for practitioners and the implications for both guideline developers and drug database providers. Other CPGs will be implemented and evaluated in real conditions by clinicians working in different health institutions.    Task-oriented evaluation of electronic medical records systems: development and validation of a questionnaire for physicians  (Hallvard L&aelig;rum  and Arild Faxvaag)  Background  Evaluation is a challenging but necessary part of the development cycle of clinical information systems like the electronic medical records (EMR) system. It is believed that such evaluations should include multiple perspectives, be comparative and employ both qualitative and quantitative methods. Self-administered questionnaires are frequently used as a quantitative evaluation method in medical informatics, but very few validated questionnaires address clinical use of EMR systems.  Methods  We have developed a task-oriented questionnaire for evaluating EMR systems from the clinician's perspective. The key feature of the questionnaire is a list of 24 general clinical tasks. It is applicable to physicians of most specialties and covers essential parts of their information-oriented work. The task list appears in two separate sections, about EMR use and task performance using the EMR, respectively. By combining these sections, the evaluator may estimate the potential impact of the EMR system on health care delivery. The results may also be compared across time, site or vendor. This paper describes the development, performance and validation of the questionnaire. Its performance is shown in two demonstration studies (n = 219 and 80). Its content is validated in an interview study (n = 10), and its reliability is investigated in a test-retest study (n = 37) and a scaling study (n = 31).  Results  In the interviews, the physicians found the general clinical tasks in the questionnaire relevant and comprehensible. The tasks were interpreted concordant to their definitions. However, the physicians found questions about tasks not explicitly or only partially supported by the EMR systems difficult to answer. The two demonstration studies provided unambiguous results and low percentages of missing responses. In addition, criterion validity was demonstrated for a majority of task-oriented questions. Their test-retest reliability was generally high, and the non-standard scale was found symmetric and ordinal.  Conclusion  This questionnaire is relevant for clinical work and EMR systems, provides reliable and interpretable results, and may be used as part of any evaluation effort involving the clinician's perspective of an EMR system.

          Automated E-mail Messaging as a Tool for Improving Quit Rates in an Internet Smoking Cessation Intervention  (Leslie Lenert, MD, Ricardo F. Mu&ntilde;oz, PhD, John E. Perez, PhD and Aditya Bansod, BS)  Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether an automated e-mail messaging system that sent individually timed educational messages (ITEMs) increased the effectiveness of an Internet smoking cessation intervention.  Design: Using two consecutive series of participants, the authors compared two Web-based self-help style smoking cessation interventions: a single-point-in-time educational intervention and an enhanced intervention that also sent ITEMs timed to participants' quit efforts. Outcomes were compared in 199 participants receiving the one-time intervention and 286 receiving ITEMs.  Measurements: Demographic factors, number of cigarettes smoked, nicotine addiction, depressive symptoms, and confidence in ability to quit were measured at entry. Twenty-four&#8211;hour quit attempts and seven-day point-prevalence of abstinence (nonrespondents assumed to smoke) were measured 30 days after each subject's self-selected quit date.  Results: The one-time and ITEMs groups differed in some demographics and some relapse risk factors but not in factors associated with 30-day quit rates. ITEMs appeared to increase the rate at which individuals set quit dates (97% vs. 91%, p = 0.005) and, among the respondents to follow-up questionnaires (n = 145), the rate of reported 24-hour quit efforts (83% vs. 54%, p = 0.001). The 30-day intent-to-treat quit rates were higher in the ITEMs group: 7.5% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.035. In multivariate analyses controlling for differences between groups, receiving ITEMs was associated with an increase in the odds ratio for quitting of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.3&#8211;5.3).  Conclusion: ITEMs sent on strategic days in smokers' quit efforts enhanced early success with smoking cessation relative to a single-point-in-time Web intervention. The effect appears to be mediated by ITEMs' causing smokers to plan and undertake quit efforts more frequently.    Modeling Patients' Acceptance of Provider-delivered E-health  (E. Vance Wilson, PhD and Nancy K. Lankton, PhD)  Objective: Health care providers are beginning to deliver a range of Internet-based services to patients; however, it is not clear which of these e-health services patients need or desire. The authors propose that patients' acceptance of provider-delivered e-health can be modeled in advance of application development by measuring the effects of several key antecedents to e-health use and applying models of acceptance developed in the information technology (IT) field.  Design: This study tested three theoretical models of IT acceptance among patients who had recently registered for access to provider-delivered e-health.  Measurements: An online questionnaire administered items measuring perceptual constructs from the IT acceptance models (intrinsic motivation, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness/extrinsic motivation, and behavioral intention to use e-health) and five hypothesized antecedents (satisfaction with medical care, health care knowledge, Internet dependence, information-seeking preference, and health care need). Responses were collected and stored in a central database.  Results: All tested IT acceptance models performed well in predicting patients' behavioral intention to use e-health. Antecedent factors of satisfaction with provider, information-seeking preference, and Internet dependence uniquely predicted constructs in the models.  Conclusion: Information technology acceptance models provide a means to understand which aspects of e-health are valued by patients and how this may affect future use. In addition, antecedents to the models can be used to predict e-health acceptance in advance of system development.    Usability of a Computer-assisted Interview System for the Unaided Self-entry of Patient Data in an Urban Rheumatology Clinic  (Carl A. Williams, MD, Thomas Templin, PhD and Angelia D. Mosley-Williams, MD, MS)  Objective: This study quantified the ease of use for patients and providers of a microcomputer-based, computer-assisted interview (CAI) system for the serial collection of the American College of Rheumatology Patient Assessment (ACRPA) questionnaire in routine outpatient clinical care in an urban rheumatology clinic.  Design: A cross-sectional survey was used.  Measurements: The answers of 93 respondents to a computer use questionnaire mailed to the 130 participants of a previous validation study of the CAI system were analyzed. For a 30-month period, the percentage of patient visits during which complete ACRPA questionnaire data were obtained with the system was determined.  Results: The computer system provided cost and labor savings in the collection of 2,476 questionnaires for 2,964 patients visits over 30 months for a capture rate of 83.5%. In the last 12 of those months, 1,035 questionnaires were collected for 1,062 patient visits (97.5% capture). There were no missing data. The prestudy capture rate was 13.5%, with 33% of surveys having complete data. Patients rated the overall usability of the system as good (mean = 1.34, standard deviation = 0.61) on a scale of 0&#8211;2, where 2 = good, but expressed difficulty with mouse manipulation and concerns about the privacy of the data entry environment.  Conclusion The system proved easy to use and cost-effective for the (mostly) unaided self-entry of self-report data for each patient for each visit in routine outpatient clinical care in an urban rheumatology clinic.    A Content Analysis of E-mail Communication between Patients and Their Providers: Patients Get the Message  (Casey B. White, MA, Cheryl A. Moyer, MPH, David T. Stern, MD, PhD and Steven J. Katz, MD, MPH)  Objective: E-mail use in the clinical setting has been slow to diffuse for several reasons, including providers' concerns about patients' inappropriate and inefficient use of the technology. This study examined the content of a random sample of patient&#8211;physician e-mail messages to determine the validity of those concerns.  Design: A qualitative analysis of patient&#8211;physician e-mail messages was performed.  Measurements: A total of 3,007 patient&#8211;physician e-mail messages were collected over 11 months as part of a randomized, controlled trial of a triage-based e-mail system in two primary care centers (including 98 physicians); 10% of messages were randomly selected for review. Messages were coded across such domains as message type, number of requests per e-mail, inclusion of sensitive content, necessity of a physician response, and message tone.  Results: The majority (82.8%) of messages addressed a single issue. The most common message types included information updates to the physicians (41.4%), prescription renewals (24.2%), health questions (13.2%), questions about test results (10.9%), referrals (8.8%), "other" (including thank yous, apologies) (8.8%), appointments (5.4%), requests for non-health-related information (4.8%), and billing questions (0.3%). Overall, messages were concise, formal, and medically relevant. Very few (5.1%) included sensitive content, and none included urgent messages. Less than half (43.2%) required a physician response.  Conclusion: A triage-based e-mail system promoted e-mail exchanges appropriate for primary care. Most patients adhered to guidelines aimed at focusing content, limiting the number of requests per message, and avoiding urgent requests or highly sensitive content. Thus, physicians' concerns about the content of patients' e-mails may be unwarranted.

          Fifteen years medical information sciences: the Amsterdam curriculum  (Monique W. Jaspers, Paul Fockens, Jan H. Ravesloot, Martien Limburg and Ameen Abu-Hanna)  Objectives: To inform the medical informatics community on the rational, goals, evolution and present contents of the Medical Information Sciences program of the University of Amsterdam and our achievements. Methods: We elaborate on the history of our program, the philosophy, contents and organizational structure of the present-day curriculum. Besides, we describe the various didactic approaches in the program and the rational for these. Finally, we analyze the contents of our program in respect to the IMIA recommendations for dedicated programs in health and medical informatics. Results and conclusions: Since its foundation in 1987, the program has undergone several major modifications. From a degree program following medical school it developed into a full-fledged, dedicated 4-year program on medical information sciences training high-school graduates for a master degree. The curriculum has been based from its outset within the University of Amsterdam-Faculty of Medicine. This organizational structure leaves ample opportunity for integration of the informatics-oriented components with the medical and health care-oriented components in the program. Student-centered approaches are heavily employed in the program, emphasizing students' critical appraisal and a style of life-long learning. Overall, our program follows the IMIA recommendations with slightly more focus on medicine and health care organization.    Visions and strategies to improve evaluation of health information systems:  Reflections and lessons based on the HIS-EVAL workshop in Innsbruck  (Elske Ammenwerth, Jytte Brender, Pirkko Nyk&auml;nen, Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Michael Rigby, Jan Talmon and on behalf of the HIS-EVAL Workshop participants)  Background: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and practice. Objective: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the Exploratory Workshop on "New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health Information Systems" (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April 2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The overall program was structured in three main parts: (a) discussion of problems and barriers to evaluation; (b) defining our visions and strategies with regard to evaluation of health information systems; and (c) organizing short-term and long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. Results: The workshop participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see Appendix B), comprising four observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. Conclusion: The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on further research on information systems' evaluation.    Enterprise resource planning for hospitals  (Godefridus G. van Merode, Siebren Groothuis and Arie Hasman)  Integrated hospitals need a central planning and control system to plan patients' processes and the required capacity. Given the changes in healthcare one can ask the question what type of information systems can best support these healthcare delivery organizations. We focus in this review on the potential of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for healthcare delivery organizations. First ERP systems are explained. An overview is then presented of the characteristics of the planning process in hospital environments. Problems with ERP that are due to the special characteristics of healthcare are presented. The situations in which ERP can or cannot be used are discussed. It is suggested to divide hospitals in a part that is concerned only with deterministic processes and a part that is concerned with non-deterministic processes. ERP can be very useful for planning and controlling the deterministic processes.    Information literacy-what it is about?:  Literature review of the concept and the context  (Kaija Saranto and Evelyn J. S. Hovenga)  Objectives: The use of IT in health care has merged advanced knowledge and skills for health care professionals. Former studies indicate that basic skills in computer use are no more than comprehensive competencies to manage electronically stored information in health care. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature focusing on the concept information literacy in the field of health, nursing and medical informatics. The target is to find out how information literacy is defined, in what kind of context it is presented and who are the focus of interest. Methods: An automated literature search was performed on-line to Medline and by using the EndNote Bibliographic Software. All together the number of papers analyzed was 97 or 78% of the total literature search result. Results: The survey indicates that the concept information literacy does not exist as such in the literature, but it can be found as a synonym to 'computer literacy' or even more obscure concepts such as 'informatics awareness' or 'computer experience'. The definitions of these concepts varied considerably. A variety of descriptions of educational programs were also found, none were based on the IMIA recommendations. Conclusions: In international cooperation such as that of IMIA WG1, a wide range of efforts still needs to be carried out to compile educational programmes in health informatics to enhance knowledge and skills in computer use among health care professionals.    Information content in Medline record fields  (Ronald N. Kostoff, Joel A. Block, Jesse A. Stump and Kirstin M. Pfeil)  Background: The authors have been conducting text mining analyses (extraction of useful information from text) of Medline records, using Abstracts as the main data source. For literature-based discovery, and other text mining applications as well, all records in a discipline need to be evaluated for determining prior art. Many Medline records do not contain Abstracts, but typically contain Titles and Mesh terms. Substitution of these fields for Abstracts in the non-Abstract records would restore the missing literature to some degree. Objectives: Determine how well the information content of Title and Mesh fields approximates that of Abstracts in Medline records. Approach: Select historical Medline records related to Raynaud's Phenomenon that contain Abstracts. Determine the information content in the Abstract fields through text mining. Then, determine the information content in the Title fields, the Mesh fields, and the combined Title-Mesh fields, and compare with the information content in the Abstracts. Results: Four metrics were used to compare the information content related to Raynaud's Phenomenon in the different fields: total number of phrases; number of unique phrases; content of factors from factor analyses; content of clusters from multi-link clustering. The Abstract field contains almost an order of magnitude more phrases than the other fields, and slightly more than an order of magnitude more unique phrases than the other fields. Each field used a factor matrix with 14 factors, and the combination of all 56 factors for the four fields represented 27 separate, but not unique, themes. These themes could be placed in two major categories, with two sub-categories per major category: Auto-immunity (antibodies, inflammation) and circulation (peripheral vessel circulation, coronary vessel circulation). All four sub-categories included representation from each field. Thus, while the focus of the representation of each field in each sub-category was moderately different, the four sub-category structure could be identified by analyzing the total factors in each field. In the cluster comparison phase of the study, the phrases used to create the clusters were the most important phrases identified for each factor. Thus, the factor matrix served as a filter for words used for clustering. While clusters were generated for all four fields, the Title hierarchy tended to be fragmented due to sparsity of the co-occurrence matrix that underlies the clusters. Therefore, the Title clusters were examined at only the lower levels of aggregation. The Abstract, Mesh, and Mesh + Title fields had the same first level taxonomy categories, auto-immunity and circulation. At the second level, the Abstract, Mesh, and Mesh + Title fields had the autoimmune diseases and antibodies sub-category in common. The Abstract and Mesh fields shared fascia inflammation as the other auto-immunity sub-category, while the other Mesh + Title sub-category focuses on vinyl chloride poisoning from industrial contact, and consequences of antineoplastic agents. However, in both cases, even though the words may be different, inflammation may be the common theme. Conclusions: For taxonomy generation, especially at the higher levels, each of the four fields has a similar thematic structure. At very detailed levels, the Mesh and Title fields run out of phrases relative to the Abstract field. Therefore, selection of field (s) to be employed for taxonomy generation depends on the objectives of the study, particularly the level of categorization required for the taxonomy. For information retrieval, or literature-based discovery, selection of the appropriate field again depends on the study objectives. If large queries, or large numbers of concepts or themes are desired, then the field with the largest number of technical phrases would be desirable. If queries or concepts represented by the more accepted popular terminology is adequate, then the smaller fields may be sufficient. Because of its established and controlled vocabulary, the Mesh field lags the Title or Abstract fields in currency. Thus, the Title or Abstract fields would retrieve records with the most explicitly stated current concepts, but the Mesh field would capture a larger swath of fields that contained a concept of interest but perhaps had a wider range of specific terminology in the Abstract or Title text. In addition, this study provides the first validated estimate of the disparity in information retrieved through text mining limited to Titles and Mesh terms relative to entire Abstracts. As much of the older biomedical literature was entered into electronic databases without associated Abstracts, literature-based discovery exercises that search the older medical literature may miss a substantial proportion of relevant information. On the basis of this study, it may be estimated that up to a log order more information may be retrieved when complete Abstracts are searched.    Technology assisted speech and language therapy  (Michael Glykas and Panagiotis Chytas)  Speech and language therapists (SLTs) are faced daily with a diversity of speech and language disabilities, which are associated with a variety of conditions ranging from client groups with overall cognitive deficits to those with more specific difficulties. It is desirable that those working with such a range of problems and with such a demanding workload, plan care efficiently. Therefore, the introduction of methodologies, reference models of work and tools, which significantly improve the effectiveness of therapy, are particularly welcome. This paper describes the first web-based tool for diagnosis, treatment and e-Learning in the field of language and speech therapy. The system allows SLTs to find the optimum treatment for each patient, it also allows any non-specialist user-SLT, patient or helper (relative etc.)-to explore their creativity, by designing their own communication aid in an interactive manner, with the use of editors such as: configuration and vocabulary. The system has been tested and piloted by potential users in Greece and the UK.
