(ohhh god did i love that!!!!!!) but then, back stage, Toto was there! and he came out and we finally met face-to-face. well... here is the weird part... the concert was over, and then mike had came over to me, and kissed me.... (OK OK THAT WAS REALLY GREAT!!!)  and he told me that he liked me... im just standing there...like..okay i feel u know, kinda...faint...but anyway.. Toto came back and Mike told Toto everything, and next, Toto asked me to be his GF! i said: HELL YEAH!!!!!!!! and then... everything worked out... but the weird part was when mike kissed me and told me that he liked me, and then he went and told toto. but that was my dream... man did i love it.... lol.. well about to put up some of my poems.. hope ya like them!! byes....

My grandfathers story by: Tomoya Saito Walking toward school one day My grandfather thought it was all fine His country was at war, But what could he do? He was just a young boy of 14   Walking into school Talking with his friends And getting into place on the field For the morning exercise Just the usual things   Suddenly having to go to the bathroom He decided to hurry But once inside, he had only a second Before he saw a light through the window   A shining bluish tint he says It's what he saw Then a big explosion And everything went dark   Half an hour later He stands up Being blown 20 ft from where he was Blood all over his body Everything around him shattered and broken Dust in the air Fire in the distance   He runs back to the field And he sees his friends Fallen Charred bodies None left alive But there's no time to cry So he heads for home   As he rides along on his bike He hears the screams of agony Leveled houses, turned into rubble Dying people everywhere Some bodies with scatches Some with peeling skin Blood trickling on the street   Bleeding and exhausted, my grandfather must find shelter So he hides for safety in his home Or the remains of it anyway For many would live to see the next day But many more wouldn't In the end, 200,000 wouldn't But my grandfather was one of the lucky ones He's a survivor   It's strange for me to realize That if he died that day in Hiroshima August 6th, 1945 I would have never been born I wouldn't have this story to tell   But...   Wars are even going on today People getting killed everyday Let's stop this madness once and for all Peace on earth Please Let no more bodies fall ^^^ omg! i think i might start crying again!! well tell me what you guys think about this poem about, maybe my true love.. well bye

      OMG I feel so bad for my best best best friend Mia! i have only two best best best friends. Stephenie, and Mia. well here is what happend... this guy, i dont know his name, but he told Mia's parents that he was the guy, Chester Bennington from LP. and he does not look a think like Chaz! and he claims that him and Mia have been 'havin it' and Mia is only 14! a year older then me! and she isnt and her parents (cuz of that)are taking away all of her LP stuff! OMG i couldnt believe it at first! it sucks, and that guy is lying and all, he is ruining Mia's life! well...she thinks i dont believe her and i do, i was just shocked yesterday. and now im talking to her sister. :sighs: i hope she is still my best (x3) friend. but anyways.. i didnt Email Toto yet.. im just kinda scared too, i mean, what if he finds a g/f in japan, or hawaii? im gonna be soo hurt.. very badly.. so when he gets back (the day b4 he does) im gonna email him hat way he has an email from me. which will be the 21st so the 22nd he'll read it..god im nervous..very nervous. but i think im inlove with him. i think about him constantly. and i see his face in my dreams, and if i could just meet him in person, i would be sooo happy.. but if he wants to be my online BF i will die of happiness.. not really die just scream and be really happy... i wonder if he is thinking about me while hes in either japan or hawaii....hmm...maybe if he does really like me, he will wanna be my bf. i hope so. cuz i really like him, love him... but im gonna take a chance and email him and tell him.. well bye 4 now.

      I think IM inlove with my friend Toto!! Really, I mean.. He is so sensitive and sweet and nice and caring and funny and cool and doesn't care what's on the outside,but whats on the inside. He is into poetry, some punk,classic rock,heavy metal ( I am too, some of it anyway) and all.. He has his own poetry site. It is the best site I have ever gone to. In my opinion anyway. And he puts so much dedication into it and all. And he likes me too but, IM afraid to tell him, that  like him too, he is on vacation right now in Hawaii, and Japan. And I miss him a lot!!! But anyways.. I met him in a poetry board, and like some guys, they HATE poetry with a passion! But he loves it! And his poems are so good and so deep. and he likes me too, and he is hot. but idc what he looks like, i care about his personality which rocks! and im gonna email him and tell him how i feel. but i am afraid to.. what should i do? should i do it? or should i wait? we've known each other for like maybe six or seven months know, but... what if he doesnt want to have an online-long distance relationship? i'll be soo heart broken. i mean..he's really cool, he makes me laugh, hes honest,sensitive,caring,sweet, and just so awesome..should i go for it? i think i will, omg he has the hottest brown eyes, and black hair, he's tall, he has tanish skin (cuz he's japanese) and he has his own rock band too called: Wasian Invasion (White and asian put together) but what should i say? i dont know what to put and im scared... but lifes about taking chances right? so im goin for it... and i hope everything turns out O.K. well bye for now.. ill write more later..cya
