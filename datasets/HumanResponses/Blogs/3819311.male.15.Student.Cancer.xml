      The biggest replica of Singapore’s most enduring symbol is to be found right here. The Merlion – half-lion, half-fish – on Sentosa is 37 metres high and has 320 scales sculpted from glass-reinforced concrete. By night, these scales are a sight to behold as they glow in different colours. Take the lift to the top floor and be rewarded with a 360° view of Sentosa and Singapore’s southern shores. From the Mouth Gallery Viewing Deck on level 9, you can even spot Singapore’s impressive skyline.   When you’re done gazing at the splendid views, head out the back and stroll down the Merlion Walk, a 120-metre-long Gaudi-inspired mosaic walkway. Treat your olfactory lobes to the aromas exuding from over 50 types of spice and herb plants in the Spice and Scented Gardens flanking both sides of the Merlion Walk.   taken from:  http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_merlion.htm

      Included in your Underwater World ticket price is a visit to the Dolphin Lagoon. You’ll get to see the highly intelligent Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in their natural environment. Observe them through a series of interactive, feeding and training sessions specially designed to demonstrate their natural abilities of tail-walking synchronisation.   Lucky visitors might even score a peck on the cheek, or a chance to wade next to them, fully supervised by the trainers, of course.  "Meet the Dolphin" sessions take place at 11am*, 1.30pm, 3.30pm & 5.30pm daily.  taken from:  (http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_dolphin.htm)

      Located at the western tip of Sentosa, Fort Siloso was built in the 1880s by the British to protect the western approaches of the Singapore Harbour.   Today, Singapore’s only preserved coastal fort still stands as an important window to our colonial past and a poignant reminder of the war years. Life-sized replicas, interactive exhibits and even authentic aromas are lovingly recreated – from the smells of detergent in the Laundry Room to the whiffs of sizzling bacon in the Cook House.   The historical landmark also provides the perfect backdrop to the permanent exhibition, ‘A Soldier Remembers – The History of Blakang Mati’. Visitors can browse through more than 245 photographs, documents and film clips on display. When ‘class’ is over, head out into the sunshine and examine actual 17th century guns and cannons, or explore the old tunnels and scare yourself silly.  taken from:  http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_fort.htm

      Explore the depths of the volcano and experience a multi-sensory show in the centre of the earth.  Have a hell-lava time at VolcanoLand, Asia’s largest man made volcano where visitors will embark on an adventure journey to discover a mysterious lost city of the Mayan and explore the depths of the volcano.   Highlights of the attraction include a subterranean journey to the ‘earth’s core’. You will uncover an Archaeological Dig, stumble through a Creepy Corridor and discover the Expedition Headquarter of Professor Hugo where he will reveal his last message.   You will take the Professor’s lead to ‘descend’ into the bowels of the earth in a ‘pit cage’, venture across subterranean waterfalls, ancient fossils and pre-historic bones, sparkling minerals and crystals formations and then cross a rickety rope bridge to reach a timeless world where you will experience a multi-sensory show on the story of the universe and close encounter with the King of Fire and culminating in a volcanic eruption!  taken from:  (http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_volcanoland.htm)

      welcome to sentosa....  Fun island ... themed entertainment ... tropical resort ... nature park ... Singapore’s Island Resort.   A former fishing village turned British military base, Sentosa was transformed into an idyllic island resort in 1972 for the enjoyment and recreation of everyone. To describe Sentosa as merely one thing or another would do no justice to the multiple facets of this island jewel half a kilometre south of Singapore. Afterall, it is the variety and versatility that make Sentosa (meaning peace and tranquillity) different and special for millions of visitors from all around the world. And unlike any other vacation destination, you are right on the fringe of the city’s buzz, which is just minutes away by cable car, ferry or via a 710-metre road link.  Once you step afoot the island, you can find your own slice of paradise among the many exciting attractions - history and culture come alive, entertainment by day and night, lush green surroundings to explore, manicured gardens, dancing fountains and two challenging international 18-hole golf courses with scenic undulating views.   Today, Sentosa is a 390-hectare recreational haven boasting a kaleidoscopic range of attractions and activities which cater to a wide audience.    taken from: (  http://www.newasia-singapore.com/sections/articles/4a/1,1176,844,00.html)
