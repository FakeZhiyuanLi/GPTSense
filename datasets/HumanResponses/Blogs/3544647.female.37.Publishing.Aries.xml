        Arrgh our lovely Jessie-Cat! Pictured here. Always likes to be around when I'm here on the PC, stretching her little paw up to me, as if to say excuse me but . . . And wondering, why don't she pay more attention to me instead. When I do, she purrs up a storm, that's her settled for the night!!

      This is my MOG BLOG page - stands for My Own Great Blog! - and also for my love for Moggies! No I'm NOT a good writer, just get by really! So expect the worse, along with errors and madeup words along the way . . . Being Creative, Artistic and loving to Design things is what I excel the most.   This may also be a wonderful place for me to post my Dad's great little poems he wrote. They mean so much to me since he died in 1989  Lots to say and lots to do, so let get started!

        urlLink   What a Excellent Film! We went to see Spider-Man 2 on Friday afternoon,&nbsp; along with my usual tray of Nachos Tortilla chips topped with jalapenos, plastic cheese, and salsa. Watch out for Doc Ock! Very nasty piece of work. A must for everyone to see. Just as good as the first if not better!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Next one I gorra see is Garfield!

      Where have I been? Busy doing nothing, I guess. Feeling sad, most days, because things in life never go right, being confused of  what to say or do. Feeling hurt, lost and lonely. Good job little Jessie is here to make me smile, and to snuggle up.  I must add my Father's poems, here's one about our Bazil cat we had for some 16 years, although this was written when he was about 2.      BAZIL         He steals across the darkend shed,    On moonlit nights, when all's a bed.    The little things that flutter by,     Seldom miss his keen green eye.         And when he's tired, he stretches out,    Until he hears my little girl shout . . .    . . . B.A.Z.I.L . . .      Copyright &copy;1989 Julie Franceschini   More poems will follow, will need to sort through them all first.
