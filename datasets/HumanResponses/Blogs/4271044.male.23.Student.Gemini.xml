      While I was organizing my computer files I came upon an essay that I wrote in school more than two years ago. I think it's worth sharing, for it deals with a subject that still resonates to this day. I must warn you, though, that although I'm fond of Gallic culture, I've never had the chance to visit France, so all of my arguments are based on what I've learned from the media and other source material.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  A STANDPOINT ON U.S.-FRENCH RELATIONS  The first chapters U.S.-French history abound with tales of comradeship between these two nations. One has not to look further than LaFayette and George Washington, the nascent U.S. government and Rousseau’s  Du Contrat Social  and the U.S-France, WWII Alliance. Fastforward to the present, and at first glance one can see more signs of amicable U.S.- French interaction: From the thousands of French and North American tourists who routinely visit each other’s homelands to Croissants, Euro Disney and the Frenchmen’s love for Woody Allen movies.  And speaking of Woody Allen, maybe one has not to look further than to the solemn monument of his hometown, the Statue of Liberty, for the best embodiment of this mutual affection between the U.S and its oldest ally. According to the statute’s sculptor, Frédéric Bartholdi, the idea for his masterpiece sparked in his mind at a dinner with French intellectuals where the host, Edouard Ren Lefebvre de Laboulaye, asked, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if people in France gave the United States a great monument as a lasting memorial to independence and thereby showed that the French government was also dedicated to the idea of human liberty?" (1).  Another case in point is that French has been one of the top foreign languages of study in the U.S. Add to that the North American writer’s penchant for French expressions in their writings and,  Voila! , one can reasonably conclude that the U.S. and France share close, friendly ties. However, to draw this conclusion is to be misled to some extent. Indeed, further examination of French-U.S. relations indicates that these countries share a cautious, if not strained, relationship despite their cordial, 200-plus year history.  On a cultural level, the French view of the U.S is nowadays less Bartholdi than José Bové. As one admired the North American way, the other wrecks McDonalds with zest. French people of course are not throwing rocks at every Starbucks they see, but they seem to grow weary at this pervading avalanche of North American culture and the flaws that it carries. This sentiment is echoed in a March 2002 report about a deranged gunman that assassinated several officials in a French town hall. In the report a French political figure named Alain Madelin said in regard to the crime that, “This American-style by-product we wished not to have in France” (2).  As noted by the D&C article  France Aims to be U.S. Alternative , there’s a growing friction between these two nations. This article tells of how France is set to contend U.S. “hyperpower,” an Americanization that extends “beyond economics, technology or military might to ‘this domination of attitudes, concepts, language and modes of life’” (4). Both countries, of course, are still allies, as Western powers that they are. But now France is taking certain steps to counter this hyperpower of the U.S., who considers this French viewpoint, in the words of former secretary of state Ms. Albright, “artificial and unnecessary; we (French and North Americans) have such a similar background. (4)”  Jean-Philippe Mathy, professor of French at the University of Illinois, elaborately conveys this French perspective on Americanization in his book,  French Resistance . Here he writes that Americanization "economically, it turns citizens into individualistic consumers and subjects the national economy to the whim of transnational corporations; culturally, it debases the high standards of the indigenous aesthetic canons, displacing Versailles with Disneyland; politically, it dissolves the shared values of citizenship into a neoromantic celebration of diversity " (3).  It is important to note that whether Mathy’s argument is right or not, on a cultural basis, the French (and for that matter, the entire world's) distaste and consequent defiance towards U.S. hyperpower must be based on cultural preservation and national pride rather than fear of cultural homogenization. In the D&amp;C article, French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine says “American supremacy would come at the expense of the planet’s healthy diversity in political, cultural and economic thought” (4). Of the three, cultural thought is one point of debate, because not even U.S. hyperpower can eliminate the world’s cultural diversity. Cultural diffusion, however extensive it is, cannot engulf other cultures without changing itself. History has shown (the Romans over the Greeks, the Mores over the Spaniards, the Spaniards over the Incas, the British over the Indians) that when a culture rules over another, each culture incorporates features from each other. Even the Tainos, an Ariwakan tribe of the Caribbean archipelago that was exploited to extinction by the conquistadores in no more than a century, left cultural prints that last to this day in words such as tobacco, barbecue and hammock.  Homogenization is not feasible, for diversity is an intrinsic quality of humanity. If, for instance, third-generation Latino Gen-Xers become more about Pop Tarts and John Grisham than tostones and Gabriel García Márquez, they will soon diversify and make their own culture. Proof of this is how descendants of African slaves in many American countries have virtually lost their ancestral culture and language to that of the English or Spanish, yet they have formed their own distinctive culture within their colonizers’ cultures, as in hip-pop, Afro-Cuban, Garifuna, etc. If U.S. culture were to consume the burkas, siestas and sakes of the world, then what would follow is the birth of a diverse mosaic of cultures from globalization’s cultural concoction. Therefore, Vendrine and all French leaders must understand that Americanization is not a homogenizing force that’s out to eliminate cultural diversity, but just another step in the human cycle of cultural change.  It must be noted that contrary to Ms. Albright’s remarks, France does have substantial reasons to stand as an alternative to U.S. hyperpower. U.S. has all the right to extend its culture just as Gallic life has expanded from Montreal to Dakar. But just because Americanization is a natural step in cultural change, France should not let its cultural, economic and political principles erode because of it. Every society has the right to preserve its values, because just as cultural change has occurred throughout history, so has the passing down of principles and traditions from generation to generation.  In light of France’s stance, the U.S. should welcome the competition to its hegemony rather than disapprove of it. Isn’t healthy competition the core of that deeply engrained U.S. value called capitalism? Competition motivates competitors to become better at what they do, so let there be more Vivendis for Time Warner, more Evians for Coca-Cola, more for Peugeots for General Motors and more Cesars for Oscar. But on the other hand, let there be less unconstructive competition such as that that took place in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics where a French figure skating judge was embroiled in an International dispute that hampered the objectivity and camaraderie in the Games and, hence, the world.  If France aims to be the U.S. alternative out of national pride, the more power to them. The world population, from its conservative elders to its impressionable youths, will rightly dictate the prevalence of either culture within its members. They’ll surely be glad to at least have a choice between two and not one.  Human liberty sits at the core of the U.S. right to extend its reach all over the world and for France to take a path of its own. Back in New York, the Statue of Liberty still stands as a symbol of France and the U.S.’s dedication to human liberty. Laboulaye was right to think that it would be wonderful to have a memorial for such an ideal, one that should be allowed to thrive in venerable competition between these two nations rather than decay in international antagonism. That way, for the sake of humankind, the Statue of Liberty maintains its significance, because…     "to the sculptor form is everything and is nothing. It is nothing without the spirit - with the idea it is everything.”   - Victor Hugo, May 13, 1885 (1)  Note: For some strange reason, the blog's template gets distorted when I add the reference section.

      September --and by that I mean college-- is just around the corner. I'm not brimming with joy; that's for sure. It's not that I don't look forward to the coursework, though I do possess an impressive body of work in the wonderful art of procrastination. Actually, it's more due to the fact that I have not fulfilled all of my summer plans. "Aaaaaaaaah, poor baaaaaaaaaaaaaaby", you may say.  But no, I'm not going to languish over my shortcomings and, besides, there are obviously more important events in this world to consider. On my homeland, the Dominican Republic, Mr. Leonel Fernández became the new head of state. Like most of his predecessors, he'll have to face, confront, avoid or just simply ignore (isn't it always a mix of the four?) the rampant corruption, resource maldistribution, and the eternal G8 hegemony that afflicts DR, along with almost all other Latin American states and developing nations throughout the world.  Latin America is one region where government leaders address these perennial challenges in their own distinctive ways. On the day of President Fernández inauguration, for instance, President Hugo Chávez was voted to remain in power by the Venezuelan electorate. Here you have Mr. Fernández, a mild-mannered lawyer in favor of privatization against Chávez, an energetic, lefttist populist whose firebrand rhetoric riles all the way to Mr. Cheney's pacemaker. Go west and you have president Uribe working alongside the DEA to eliminate the drug cartels in a war that apparently will never end, to the lament of Colombians, Latin Americans, and North Americans as a whole.  Go south and there's Mr. Toledo of Peru who's mostly known as the Latin American president with the least amount of public support. In Bolivia president Mesa also won an important election, although not for the right to remain in power. Instead, it was about public approval of a controversial plan to export the nation's gas, which entails a brew of Big Bussiness meddling, native indian rebellion and the fair distribution of the nation's wealth amongst the populace. It is sad to learn that part of the controversy also involved using Chile's ports to export the gas of land-locked Bolivia. How regrettable that between Chile and Bolivia, brothers in history and language, there is so much contempt; one that according to the news stems from the war in which Bolivia lost to Chile her access to the sea. Hopefully, somewhere down the road these two nations will reach some form of compromise.  I also hope that president Kirchner and his cabinet continue to lift Argentina from the devastating economic collapse that ocurred not long ago. Sometimes I feared that DR would also fall into economic chaos, as inflation and  apagones  (blackouts) continue to threaten its stability. In this ominous state in which poverty fuels desperation, many of my countrymen embarked on a treacherous sail to Puerto Rico that ultimately yielded nothing more than death and sorrow.  Amid their peril lies the abhorrible treason that's forever present in the developing world. After two or three days on sail, the  yola , as the standard-fare migrant boat is commonly known, ran out of fuel. Desperate and helpless in the vastness of the sea, the migrants were relieved to see another  yola  pass by. The captain of the stranded boat told everyone that he will board this incoming vessel to then return with the necessary fuel and supplies. After three days in which the migrants ran out of their boiled eggs, water, and sardines, they came to realize that the captain, el  maldito  captain, deserted them. After more than week at sea, they were finally rescued by some fishermen not far from where they began their odissey. Back in DR, the survivors came with tales of comptemplating cannibalism, of women being forced to share their breast milk, and of people in utter upheaval jumping to the sea. It was ultimately an endeavor marred by risk, treason and death.  The most heart-wrenching part of this story is how the "leader" dared to say that he'll come back; that he'll save the people who payed and risked so much to understake this trip under his wing. How many leaders, from coyotes and oligarchs to liberals and neoconservatives, have left their people in the cold? Alas, nepotism and cronysm are kings and unscrupulous self-interest their driving force. What a shame. Four our sake, let us not forget all that we are risking, the perilousness of our ongoing trek and the responsibility of our leaders, regardless of affiliation, to never,  never , dare to abandon ship, for that's one of, if not the most, vile and inhumane act that could arise from the heart of man.  As I said before, I have many personal regrets about this summer. But, needless to say, the real worries are those on the global scale. In this  yola  of ours, we ought to be cautious against those who would dare abandon ship and more so against those passengers that upon reaching their destination, would forget about those that stayed behind.
