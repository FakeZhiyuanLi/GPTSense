         Well, we had a first this morning... Maitlyn totally enjoyed swim lessons! She didn't complain one bit, did everything she was asked and even had fun! One of the things she always complained about was the kickboard. Today, as she was kicking across the pool with the kickboard, she said to me "I like the kickboard." She even dog-paddled for a few feet several times!

         So Maitlyn and I are going to Swim Ranch tomorrow for swim lessons (day 3). She took lessons last year as well, but she is still rather tentative about any water that is over her head. So that means that during swimming lessons, I put on my biggest smile and try to be as persuasive as an attorney. Usually the first 5-10 minutes are spent with me trying to pry her arms from around my neck - she is supposed to face away from me for most of the exercises in the water. Nonetheless, I think she is making progress and is growing in her comfort with water. That is the goal. She might not officially swim this summer, but I have to think of it as one more step towards that day when she does.

        So, I've been planning on starting my blog for quite some time now. Why haven't I started it until now, you ask? Well, you know... life is busy, blah, blah, blah. So here I go. Sometimes the best way to start something is just to start.      For the most part, we've finally settled back down into "regular life" back in Arkansas (we were in Colorado for 5 weeks this summer). This week, I'm taking Maitlyn to swim lessons each morning (except for Tuesday... staff meetings...), and getting ready to leave on the Mantrip. Mantrip is a week long backpacking trip to southwestern Colorado. What is it about the mountains that continues to draw me? It's like they're magnetic and I'm a big piece of iron. My soul just finds its rest there. In fact, Elise and I are planning another trip at the end of September to see the aspen trees change. It will be her first backpacking experience. We've dayhiked plenty of times together, she's just never been out overnight with me. I think we're planning on Rocky Mountain National Park since we have friends in Estes Park that we can probably stay with on the way up and on the way back. The great thing is that we have all the gear we need and Elise will only have to borrow a pack.      Enough about the mountains. I could go on for days. Anyway, welcome to the Harkey Blog!
