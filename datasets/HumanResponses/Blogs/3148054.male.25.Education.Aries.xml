       Soccer great Diego Maradona is in a Buenos Aires hospital recovering from a lung condition, not his decade old coke habit as widely reported in the press. For those that don't know, Maradona along with Pelé were the greatest soccer players of all time and it saddens me to know that one of my childhood heroes is now sniffing his fame away. This happens to a lot of atheletes and celebrities in general, but I just never expected it from the guy who was named  urlLink FIFA's  co-player of the Century along with Pelé, seeing as the latter served as Brazil's Minister of sports from '90 to '98 and is an-alround stand up guy.  Still, Maradona is only 43 and still has a way to go before being voted crackhead of the century by FIFA.

         So I just finished wasting 2 hours of my life watching  urlLink Johnny Depp  as Commander Spencer Armacost brain-fuck his wife Jillian aka  urlLink Charlize Theron  in the most grueling, obnoxiously bad movie ever made -  urlLink The Astronauts Wife .  I'll spoil the plot here on purpose since no one in their right mind should see this movie ever. Unless of course you want to see it just for Charlize, in which case there’s plenty of nudie pics on the net so I wouldn’t even bother. Plus with character names like Spence and Jill Aramacost (WTF?!) you’d feel bad about Charlize or Johnny for that matter starring in such a shitty movie. I mean what a piece of crap. The story goes like this. Spencer and his space cadet buddy Alex ( urlLink Nick Cassavetes ) go up to space to fix a satellite for NASA when something inexplicable happens during this 2-minute blackout. Both men won't talk about it, except upon their return Alex promptly has a cardiac and dies leaving his three-weeks pregnant with twins wife electrocuting herself in the bathtub with the radio Alex “talked to” before he died. Long story very short, Alex and Jill move to New York where Alex is hired by some big concern to produce this kick ass fighter jet that’s supposed to fire electric shock rather than missiles. One night Spencer and Jill make rough nookie and guess what? She’s also pregnant with twins! Well it turns out that during those two minutes in space, Spencer got some alien gene inside him and when Jill finds out all about it through this neurotic head-case NASA dude Reese, Spencer turns all sour killing him and Jill’s visiting sister (for no apparent reason). So Jill doesn’t take the turn of events quite as chippy as Spencer thought she would and decides to do the same as Alex’s wife with an almost identical radio that, you guessed it, Spence’ve been chatting with lately. So, here’s the grand climax of this piece of goat vomit: While she does it, she gets Spencer in the water and kills him, the alien energy escapes him in the cheesiest effects scene ever and goes into her! With the evil alien energy still inside her, she lives on happily ever after with a new pilot-husband and some creepy looking blonde twins. Not only do you never see cool space action, the movie just generally blows all around. Thank God it was a free rental at BlockBuster.

      The New York Times has an  urlLink article  (free reg) about Sony's new venture into the ultra-high-end world of boutique electronics called  urlLink Qualia . Jewellery eletronics are nothing new.  urlLink Vertu  makes "Precision Communications Instruments" which combine a rather basic GSM worldphone with a platinum, silver or gold cover. I agree that the Qualia TV looks damn cool, but a  urlLink Bang and Olufsen  unit is probably a better buy.  The same holds true for the Vertu units. Any of the recent  urlLink SonyEricsson  or  urlLink Nokia  handsets easily defeat the Vertu both in terms of their technical specs and functionality, but being mass-market items, limits their appeal to the elite that strive for differentiation. Will this be the beginning of an era where ordinary consumers will actually hold more technologically advanced products than their upper-class breathren?

      LEGOLAND California and Volvo have nothing better to do with their time than to make a life-size  urlLink LEGO'd version  of their flagship  urlLink XC90  SUV. Wait a minute, I didn't mean to come off sarcastic. THIS THING RULES!   Speaking of Volvo, their  urlLink website  promoting the new S40 is really cool.

      In the ever expanding research of military technology, the folks at the University of Buffalo received a $1.5 million grant to fund research into inorganic blood substitutes. The technology makes it possible for a soldier to survive in the field for three hours with a 60% blood loss level. The compound called dodecaflouropentane emulsion, or DDFPe can expand into microbubbles small enough to deliver oxygen into the system through the capillaries.  When I think of the amount of money that is spent on military research that could be used to treat cancer or AIDS, it makes my blood boil. HA ;)

        No, I don't have a toilet that costs $5000, but in an article on new toilet technologies, (I have no clue why I was reading this)  urlLink Reuters  mentions a Japanese (who else?) firm  urlLink ToTo Ltd.  that developed the remote-controlled  urlLink Neorest  toilet complete with a seat warmer and air deodorizer. Its lid also automatically lifts when a person approaches and it uses just 1.2 gallons of water, which in toilet tech is supposed to be good. What will they think of next?

      This is my first attempt at personal publishing. The main intent here is to simply provide a space for a coherent display of what I find on the Internet that is of any interest to me. Focus will be based primarliy on technology and the way it influences social constructs.  The framework of the site is borrowed completely from the wonderful people at  urlLink Blogger  who made the software of the same name that powers  urlLink litevsky.com/blogger . Emphasis is made on the balance between visual appeal and lean html.  I hope to have the default templates changed over time as well as add a list of sites I find worthwhile.

       Yeah, so if you thought that you couldn't possibly do anything cool with that biochemistry degree of yours, think again! The Japanese have discovered a great way to revitilize the boring round watermelon. I give you the all new WaterMelon X-Type Square and X-Type Pyramid! (ed)  The designer vegetable starts at 12,000 yen which in Canadian-speak amounts to about $140.  p.s. Note the whole Egyptian theme happening there.

      So Engadget is  urlLink reporting  on this crazy new controller from NTT DoCoMo that is basically a  urlLink watch  that has a sensor which detects the vibration your hand produces when you tap your fingers together or on another part of your body. This can be used to control other devices via a short-range protocol like Bluetooth. You can for example tap your middle finger on top of your index finger to increase the volume of your Bluetooth headset or vice-versa to decrease it. Way cool.
