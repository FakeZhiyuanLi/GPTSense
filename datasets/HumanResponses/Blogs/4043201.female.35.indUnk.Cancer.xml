        Why is the world so slow?  Why does everyone think it acceptable to drive as though there is nothing worth getting to ahead of them and they can just mosey on down the road at whatever pace they prefer(usually that of a retarded snail)?  I can't understand why people in front of me are afraid to miss the red light.  Are they afraid of actually getting where they're going?  Is there something horrible there that they need to prolong the time they spend away from it?  I suppose for most people this is their jobs.  I don't understand this either.  If you don't like a job then don't do it.  If you want to offer me any one of the thousands of excuses most people do, forget it.  They are falling on deaf ears.  I have listened to the most common ones and don't agree with any of them.  Even still, if people are afraid to go to work, then why is the commute home just as slow?  Surely they must be happy that they made it out of their job alive and employed(for now) so why do they not wish to return home quickly?  As far as I'm concerned, the freeway is for driving as fast as the law permits and getting to where you're going as fast as possible.  Why does noone else agree with me?  Why doesn't anyone else want to get to where they're going A.F.A.P., all day every day?

       It's fine for what it is, but it's not fast enough for me.  I need a Brainblog.  I seriously need a blog that I can post to from my brain with no effort.  I came to this conclusion whilst biking the other day and realized that the reason I will never be able to keep this up to date is that I don't work this way.  At  least not the way this is supposed to work.  I need a medium that I can trasmit my thoughts to as they happen, because that is where the action is.  I usually forget my best ideas by the time I get in front of the computer to post them, so they inevitably end up being half-assed versions of what they were when they happened.  I always find myself having thoughts to myself out loud which would be great additions to this thing if they were posted as soon as they occurred.  I don't see why this shouldn't be feasible someday.  Seriously, the brain is essentially a massively parallel computer which is run by very low-level electrical current.  If you could figure out a way to measure this current and figure out what you're measuring(in other words, correlate the specific current fluxuations with specific thoughts or impulses), you might have something.  Yeah, it sounds like an impossibility, but eventually we'll be able to do better brain assays and brain measurments.  So once this is all done and figured out I'm gonna need a little plug I can put in my ear that will be able to inperpret what I'm thinking and then write it down and post it here.  That part is easy.  The hard part will be figuring out the brain-blog interface.  Oh well, someday.

       So I just got done watching "Love Actually," that very sappy film made last year or so by the British chap who wrote "Four Weddings And a Funeral."  This one wasn't half as good as that.  It essentially boils down to this:  "Be happy with the one you love because they're the only one you've got."  I think.  I'm still not sure...whatever it was, it was a waste of Hugh Grant's talent and Kiera Knightly and Martine McCutcheon's fabulous beauties(and booties--no pun intended).

       Thanks to some good connections, I have a Gmail account.  If you don't know what Gmail is, it's Google's email service that is currently in Beta testing.  I could tell you how I got my account, but suffice it to say, "I know a guy who knows a guy".    Seriously, I do.  In any case, it's pretty nice, but nothing terribly exciting.  I have yet to be able to use it too much because the whole point of it is that its only good if you have lots of messages to organize.  I mean A LOT.  They give you up to a Gig of storage, and they don't expect you to throw anything away.  I have a total of maybe 4 messages so far.   Maybe I should tell somebody my address so they can send me something?

       All in all, nothing terribly exciting to report.  Weekend was productive due to the fact that the boys from California were in town doing their semi-annual disaster recovery test which I gladly helped out on.  Not that that I do much, I just do the 2000 installs and the configuration of the app and then they do the testing.  But I get to hang out with old buddies and get free food out of it.  In the immortal words of Bruce Lee Park:  "I may not be hungry, but I can always eat."   Oh, and if you ever go to the Capital Grille on Broad Street, check out one of the hostesses there, with long brunette hair and a fabulous bod.  This is not "Butterface," she is definitely the complete package.   I'm so stupid, I should have gotten her name.  It not like she wasn't wearing a name tag or anything...Oh well, there's always next Sunday.

       People have decided to remind me that I am now 28 years older than I was when I was born.   As if I really care...I still feel like I did in 9th grade.  Except now I have less hair on my head and more fat around my stomach.

       I have decided to limit posting of comment to registered users for the simple fact that I want to know who the hell you people are.  If you have something to say, don't hide behind the veil of computerized anonymity, that's my job.

       I have decided to rename myself Geezus Christ after the phrase I seem to find myself uttering as I drive my car virtually anywhere.  Not to mention my buddy SkinnyWhiteBoy(SWB) suggested I might want some measure of anonymity on this forum.  Ok, so Geezus Christ it is....nice.

Sheesh - how wuz I supposed to know that there are no first names allowed?&nbsp;   Ok, i have to admit, I really hate to use the word pussy.&nbsp; In any context - even pussy cat.&nbsp; I have no problems, mostly, with all other nouns with the same meaning, though, even those that are deemed most vulgar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that I have now (including this next one) written the word pussy four times in this entry.   well, anyway, I didn't have much else to say except that  urlLink www.fark.com  is a good site.&nbsp;   and I don't know if I am going to the kerry rally as rain is a deterent.&nbsp; and since there aren't free cosmos, why bother?&nbsp; today, i vote for another drink. in november, i'll vote for another "dink" - but hopefully this one will help our country rather than take it to a pointless war.   &nbsp;

       Bow before your master for its name is Sriracha.   In case you don't know,  urlLink Sriracha  is the name of the Vietnamese hot sauce I was recently introduced to at my friend SkinyWhite's house.   This stuff rocks.   It starts out as a slow burn and progresses to a searing pain&nbsp;unlike anything you've ever felt.&nbsp; And for some reason I can't seem to get enough it it either.&nbsp; No matter how much it&nbsp; hurts I keep dabbing my food into it and each time I do the pain increases.&nbsp; Now I'm not&nbsp;masochist, or at least not clinically diagnosed as such, but I love the sweet intense pain associated with even the smallest drop of this heavenly elixir.&nbsp; You can't get rid of it very easily either.&nbsp; It takes a glass of your finest cow's milk to quench the burn(If you have breast milk, I imagine that would work too, but I have no evidence to support it nor the resources to try).   Go out and get some.   Now.

        I'll try and make this as simple as possible people:   When you are indicating possession of something or that something is possessed by someone you use the apostrophe inbetween the word and the letter s.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;    Bob's car, Jim's house, Geezus's cross, etc. -- you get the point(no pun intended).  &nbsp;   When trying to indicate a plurality of objects you just need an "s" with no apostrophe!&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;  &nbsp;    cars, houses, crosses, etc.     If the word "it's" confuses you then this will help you too.&nbsp; "It's" is a contraction of "It" and "is".&nbsp; If you did not substitute "it's" you would have to use "it is" instead.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;     It's a house, It's a car, It's a cross, etc.     If you were confusing it with "its," then be confused no more.&nbsp; "Its" is the indicator of a possesive, so for example:&nbsp;     The monster picked its teeth, the dog lost its bearings, etc.  &nbsp;   Make sense?&nbsp; Any questions?&nbsp;

       I am astounded that so many people function so well with but a brainstem as their neural Hemi. As I was driving through a local town devastated by a tornado yesterday, I was dumbfounded by the fact that people were driving 15 mph in&nbsp;40 mph zones. Now, if you have absolutely nowhere to go, this works out marvelously. However, if you are rather busy professional and are always 16 days behind on everything you do, then this is slightly suboptimal. In any event - is there  any  reason why anyone should be going 15 mph in a 40? I mean, aside from the fact that everyone in PA immediately drops their speed to 10 mph when they come within farting distance of rain...nevermind that thing called snow. Okay, okay, so maybe it's sort of safety oriented to slow down a  tad.  On this particular day, however, it was sunny and 70 out. Then I thought that maybe this was related to the tornado that had passed through here.  &nbsp;  Operative term being  passed , as in the past tense form of the verb. So it's not like some hapless cow will come crashing down on their Caravan (with the patented "My boss is a Jewish carpenter" bumper sticker decaying on the cheap ABS plastic bumper) from the heavens or they might encounter an "obstacle", like a couple of leaves.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So any ideas on why people were going 15 mph in a 40 mph zone on a sunny day  after  a tornado struck and the road crews already cleaned up?

       My friend Skinnywhite's girlfriend sent me an email about Microsoft's upcoming release of their latest service pack for Windows XP. The link is included so feel free to read it and my response:     urlLink http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,116721,00.asp   see above. what do you think?  i don't have XP but plenty of people i know do. any validity?  hope your new hairdo is treating you well.  -jd.    My response:    Yeah. &nbsp;   Perfectly valid points. &nbsp;The best reaction to this (and all Microsoft "Service Packs") is "Let someone else try it first." &nbsp;Better yet, if you have an exact duplicate of your daily computer you don't mind sacrificing then try it on that first. &nbsp;If, after 3-4 months of apparently "un-broken-ness" is observed, THEN consider putting it on your main PC. &nbsp;It's called the bleeding edge of technology for a reason. &nbsp;You don't want to install the update and find out that your computer has converted all your financial documents into Polish Zlotys before deciding to forget where they are and then simultaneously offering to print them double-sided on a printer in the office down the street. &nbsp;Not that stuff like THAT usually happens, usually it's more like this: &nbsp;You reboot and find that you can no longer get to the internet anymore and your top 6 favorite applications don't work AT ALL anymore and you have to go to the internet to get the update to those programs which would be trivial if XP hadn't broken your ability to do just that. &nbsp;   But I digress.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It represents one of our most broadly tested products to date,' Microsoft's &nbsp;&nbsp;  Pilla says."   Always be skeptical of any Microsoft representative who claims that anything they make or test is in some way better or neater or "more thoroughly tested" or "stronger, faster and sexier" than anything else anywhere.    Usually it means it sucks.    But otherwise everything should be fine. Oh, and my hairdo is fine, thanks. One of these days I'm going to post some pictures to this site so you can know what your Lord and Master looks like...

       It is generally accepted that I am sort of lazy.  Not in all things, and not all the time, but for part of the time I am pretty damn lazy.  In any case, my laziness got the better of me this morning so I decided to ride the shuttle to work instead of walking the 6 blocks. Now, for the most part I try and keep to myself and not talk to anyone if possible.  It's not that I hate everyone(although sometimes I can), it's more that I would rather not have to talk to someone on my way into work if possible.  I like to take the few minutes the driver takes to navigate an otherwise boring road course and just gather my thoughts in preparation for the day ahead.  That or I try and get some more sleep if I can. Today my concentration/nap was disturbed by the comment one passenger made to another:  "Looks like it's gonna be a hot one today, huh?"  This comment was apparently unprovoked(and to my mind) unwarranted, but that did not stop the addressee from replying:  "Yeah, it sure does!"  Now, the mindless drivel continued for a few seconds after this exchange, but the damage was already done.  The otherwise peaceful silence of the morning bus ride was irrevocably destroyed.  It started me thinking:  Why do people feel the need to fill empty air with the sound of their voice?  Does silence make people uncomfortable?  Are people afraid that if they don't say something they will explode?  I can understand useful conversation to obtain some information from a stranger, and I can even understand some less than intellectual chatter between close friends and/or intimates, but strangers?  Seriously now, who the hell cares?  Why do you people think that you need to talk to someone you've never met, assuming that they want to hear what you say?  The sad fact is that most of the people in the world react the way the person on the shuttle did.  They LIKE the attention their fellow man is showing them.  I guess they must see it as a sign of acceptance and approval.      Person 2(to self):"Oh good, he's going to talk to me, I must have done something right.  Let's hope he doesn't try and ask me anything I need to think about, I definitely wouldn't want to use my brain for any reason."  Person 1(out loud):"Looks like it's gonna be a hot one today, huh?"  Person 2(to self):"Yes!  He didn't ask me anything hard!  I don't have to think yet!  I can still keep my brain in neutral!  YAY!"  Person 2(out loud): "Yeah, it sure does!"  Person 2(to self): "WHEW!  I got out of that one...let's just hope no-one at work asks me anything before I get to leave."     Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of moments where my brain isn't fully engaged, but I'm working on it.  I just don't understand why everyone seems to be content to exist the way they do.  They all seem to enjoy living normal lives where they can get up, go to work, come home, go to sleep, get up and repeat.    Sounds like fun.  Congratulations world, you've succeeded in preventing anything interesting or groundbreaking from happening all so you can maintain the status quo.  Strong work.  Really, you should be proud of yourself.

       So while I was performing the arduous task of "studying" for my MCATs this past week in the relative isolation of Vermont, I happened to take a break to go bowling with some friends. We bowled a total of three games. I had scores of 141, 171, and 105('round there). While I have never claimed to be a great bowler apparently someone thinks I am: In the middle of bowling my 171 game the guy next to us asked me if I wanted to join the league.  Yup.   I was asked to join the bowling league.  Now, for a second it flabbergasted me that this guy thought I was considered good enough to join such a prestigious affair.   I've been asked to join  lotsa things, from the...uh...er...well lotsa things, but  never  a bowling league.  I guess one day my patients will come into my office and see my  "Brattleboro Bowl Winter Bowling League" plaque next to the medical degree and be duly impressed.  'Certainly this man must be a fine physician, for he had enough time to become a bowler worthy of admittance to "the league"'.(Yes, I know, my patients are quite eloquent...)  Ok, so this sounds far less coherent than the inspiring conversations and laughter did, but it's a glimpse into my vacation and if I figure out a better way to present it I will.

       Ok, I'm a bit too livid to go into details right now, but I got a ticket this morning on my way to the hospital because my inspection sticker is colored red.  I have a temporary inspection sticker right now which means that I have 45 days from the date of inspection to make the repairs indicated.  Well it has only been about two weeks and some bored cop pulled me over because he saw the temp sticker and wanted to ask about it(I imagine he had nothing better to do).  I explained my situation and that I had an appointment to get my car fixed and that's why I hadn't done so already, but he did not seem to agree that that was a valid reason for not getting the repairs done immediately.  I told him that the inspection center said I had 45 days to make the repairs and that I was well within the allowed time.  He took my information under no consideration and went back to his car.  He came back and issued me a summons(ticket) and said that if I wanted to plead "not guilty" I could and the indicated date.  I HAVE 45 DAYS ASSHOLE!!!!!  What a moron...I am given 45 days by the stated of new jersey and this local policeman is now contradicting it to say he's going to give me a ticket regardless.  I am so angry I can't exacly think or type straight right now but I will update this later...

       A friend of mine once said in regards to people driving after a thunderstorm: "Instant idiots, just add water." How right he was. Why is it people always seem to drive at a retarded pace when there is the slightest hint of moisture on the ground? We have just had a enormous thunderstorm/downpour here and for some reason, it seems to have made everyone forget where their accelerator pedals are. I spent almost 45 minutes going a total of about 30 blocks.  30 blocks.  Normally it takes me about 10-15 minutes to go the same distance. That's on a day with traffic. Now, with rain and thunder recently departed everyone has to drive like they just got their learner's permit. I have four words for you people:  Coefficient of Kinetic Friction    This is the number in the physics equations that determines the propensity of one material to "stick" relative to another. For example, a car wheel made of wood or metal or ice has a fairly low coefficient. Rubber, on the other hand, has an extremely high coefficient. At least when we're dealing with standard asphalt/Macadam roads which 98%(a guess) of the world's road are. My point is this: You morons can go a little bit faster because  your tires can handle it . That is to say if you have the proper amount of inflation in them, the tires can handle the  slight  decrease in friction water causes. And I do mean slight, because your tires have these things called  treads  on them which act like little suction cups on the road. Now, if you have bald tires, you shouldn't be on the road anyways, but hopefully you'll kill yourself one night without taking any of use with you.  Ok, I'm done for now, keep posted for more post-rain commentary...

       I had the chance to interact with a technical support rep of the  urlLink Insightful Corporation  today, and was it fun! To give you a quick synopsis, Insightful makes a product called S-Plus Server which is a software package that is designed to run statistical analyses on lab data and the like. One of the features is the ability to generate graphs of data "on-the-fly," or dynamically so that a user can point his web-browser to the server's address, click a few buttons and get back a nice little graph of whatever the hell he's interested in. The technology that S-Plus uses to do this is a combination of "S" language code(from the folks at insightful) running on top of Apache Server with the Tomcat JSP server as well. It is Apache's job to host all the web pages and provide the web server functionality, Tomcat's job to provide the Java Server functionality and S-plus's job to create and format the commands to be sent to the other two. If any one of these three parts are not working, the whole thing won't work. Apparently, if some of these things aren't working it will still "sort of" work, but not completely, and not sufficiently to do what it is designed to do. In any case, I was having a problem with the Tomcat side of things and had sent an email to my current support engineer with the log file generated with all pertinent errors in it. What follows is the email I received back from the support engineer. I have masked any personal information.    Dear "Geezus", Thank you for your question. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Problem Description: I followed your instructions and was successful in running a "SplusAS -g" on the server console itself. This did not, however, solve the actual error I was experiencing. I have attached the Tomcat log file for your information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Solution: From the log file it appears that there's some problem reading the SplusConnections.xml that contains all of the details about the connection to the server. Either the file doesn't exist, or it contains bad data.  Either try fixing up the file, or you should just be able to manually add a connection using the http://server:8080/sjsp/ and click the Connections List link. See if any connections exist, and if not, add one there. This assumes that the server can actually get that far.  I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. Sincerely, "S-Plus Support Guy"   Hmmm. What a helpful suggestion.  WTF people?!? Is this supposed to pass for support? Does this guy think that if I had tried all this stuff and it had worked I would even be talking to him? I'm writing to HIM so that HE can help me. I used to work TS, here's what you do: You try and get as much as possible about the problem from the user. Interrogate them. Make them go over anything and everything in an effort to find out if they are making a stupid mistake or if they really have the kind of problem they say they do. It is the job of the support engineer to figure out what is going on based on the information available to him at the time. If he needs more information, ask the complainant more about the nature of the problem. Don't just sit there with your thumb up your butt waiting for them to do your job for you! Here is my reply:    From: Geezus [ mailto:whoknows@whocares.net] Sent: Tuesday, August 03, 2004 1:56 PM To: 'support@insightful.com' Subject: RE: Splus 6.2 Error {[CASE#94860]}  No Problem.  Assuming I can't manually add a connection and have tried, how do you suggest I go about "fixing up" the SplusConnections.xml file? Shall I take it to my local XML shop? Maybe there is a "Jiffy XML" nearby? Do you have a list of authorized XML repair facilities? I would not want to take it to a less than reputable repair facility(we all know what happens when one does that!).  Please advise.  Thanks, Geezus   I used to talk to a great guy by the name of Joe Roberts. He was a truly great tech who was thorough, patient and understanding when I would make silly mistakes or forget something obvious like setting an environment variable. The other thing that Joe was good at was listening to me describe the problem and asking me as much as possible about what was going on. A really good tech. Sadly enough, Joe has passed on. No, he's not dead, he's moved over to the QA group. Sure, they make more money and he deserves it, but c'mon people, replace him with someone competent please?
