      The  urlLink CGMC  show opened last night, and despite a very modest crowd, I think it went very well.   This was the first show that I had people from work come to see-- and this wasn't just a random co-worker or someone from another department, either.  One of my direct managers came and so did THE boss, the Chief Marketing Officer (as her title reads) and her daughter and husband.  So yeah, it better NOT have sucked.  They loved it, though-- raves all around.  I was beaming.   I'm disappointed by the ticket sales, though.  We sold out nearly all of our Holiday shows for this season, which was because of a combination of a huge push in marketing, a surge in season subscription tickets and the Chorus talking up the show.  We do three shows a season... the Holiday one, one in the spring (usually in April) and one during Pride.    We switched the dates for our Pride show this year, however, and I think that hurt sales.  Our reasons were valid-- there are a MILLION things to do during Pride weekend, and our show was always one of them.  But I think that's what drives sales in the first place.  One of the things people do during Pride weekend is see the Chorus.  And when we weren't there to fill that need, they found something else.  Now it's TWO weekends later, and we're still singing about Pride.  Call me crazy but I'm Prided out.  I'm sure others felt the same, hence the dropoff in sales.  Rumor has it we will go back to "normal" next year.  I hope so!!  It really is a fun show, with some gorgeous singing.     urlLink    Here are those German boys.  Aye Aye!&nbsp; urlLink     The German set is adorable.  They aren't always together and you can't always understand their English so well, but you have to admire their gusto and their love for staging.  And the pirate costumes are pretty cute too... and flexible.  One song struck me as hilarious-- they are wearing these little bandanas on their heads throughout most of the set, tied in the back.  At one point they sing a song about swabbing the deck, and they stop, turn the bandanas around to mimic "Aunt Jemima" or something along those lines, and it is simply hilarious.  There's much more but it's just worth saying GO SEE IT and find out.   urlLink Windy City  sounds fabulous of course, and their love for musical perfection is evident in their set.  I also sing with the  urlLink Windy City  organization, however not this particular chorus, so I performed with them a couple weeks ago for their concert.     urlLink    The boys from Windy City&nbsp; urlLink     Their musical director is taking them in a good direction, I think.  Highlights are a sampling from Rutter's "Requiem" and a nautical set that is highlighted with "What Do You Do With A Drunken Sailor".  I can't help but think that if CGMC did that song, we would change it to "What Do You Do With A Drunken Drag Queen"... the lyrical possibilities are endless.  Since we have the German boys to be campy and funny and silly,  urlLink CGMC   keeps it a little serious this time around, and frankly I'm glad.     urlLink    Patrick Sinozich, CGMC's Artistic Director&nbsp; urlLink     Patrick Sinozich, our director, has assembled one of the most ambitious and challenging sets for our chorus in a long time, and we are really doing a wonderful job with it.  Highlights are:   Daemon Irrepitus Callidus , a truly demonic piece (whee!),  Arise My Beloved , a lovely verse from Song of Songs that Patrick wrote a lush and gorgeous piece of music to accompany,  Jimmy Jimmy , which is an upbeat ditty based on an old folk tune and tells a story that ends in a gay wedding (how topical!), and my personal favorite,  This Moment As I Sit Alone , the marriage of the third movement of Rachmaninoff's Concerto for Piano and Cello (Andante) Op. 19 and a gorgeous poem by Walt Whitman that expresses his love for men and the question that if one can love a man in his own land, he could also love a man in other lands... it is moving, gorgeously arranged (again a Sinozich creation) and lovingly sung.    So again, if you haven't got your tickets yet, you have two more chances.  Performances today are at 5:00PM and 8:30PM at the Athenaeum Theatre and are on sale through Ticketmaster and at the Box Office.  Click  urlLink here  for a visit to CGMC's website and click on the concert's logo for ticket ordering info.  So I get to rest until our call, which is at 4:45.  I think some guys are at the beach today, but the temperature is only 67 degrees at 10AM.  Hm.  Not prime beach weather, but I could use some fresh air.  We had an opening night party at one of our members' homes last night and I was up far too late and drank one too many.  Ouch.  Why do I not remember to pop two Tylenol before bed?  Silly me.  So I am recovering and hoping this headache goes away soon.  Fresh air could help, no?  Yes.  So I may have to join them.  Whee!  Please leave a comment if you're out there reading this!  I have no idea if you are otherwise, and I'd hate to think I'm the only one that gets to enjoy my ramblings. :)

      Last night I posted my old Journal to my Geocities web account for your viewing pleasure.  You can find the links at the sidebar to the left.    I was nice enough to make them look pretty too... I had some god-awful background image on them before and they were UUUUGLY!  But hey, that's how web pages looked back in 1997. ;)  Reading those old posts, which were written starting around the time I got the job that moved me to Chicago, I'm reminded how "Mary Richards-ish" (from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show") I was back then.  So idealistic, so hopeful, so giddy... I was moving to the big city, just getting my start in "adult" life.  Who knew what would lie ahead?  I could only wait and see.   Seven years later, a lot has changed.  And a lot more will change in the future.

      Wow...  My first few postings are really... ranty!  I guess I really needed to vent a few emotions here and there.  Now that I've got that out of my system, maybe I can do more fun stuff. :)    Oh no!  I smileyed!  I told myself I wouldn't do that here, but dammit, I couldn't help it!  Please, someone, make me stop before I go too far with the smileys!!!  Well it's dress rehearsal tonight with the Chorus.  We sounded damn good last night, but we can sound even better.  I really can't wait until we do this show.  It's going to be tremendous.  Gotta run.  Call is at 6:30 and it's almost 5:30.  Driving from downtown to the Athenaeum is always a joy.  Whee!  Oh and wish me luck on meeting a cute German boy.  Whoo hoo! ;-)    Aaaaugh! :)  Oh well. :-P

      BREAKING NEWS!   urlLink Ridge Warns of 'Credible' al-Qaida Plot   Oh great, more terror news.  It seems to me that every time the Department of Homeland Security issues a bulletin about possible al Qaida plots or strikes, the only ones getting all worked up is the Department of Homeland Security.  Aren't these the same people that told us, way back when, that we should just go about or daily lives and not let ourselves get too worried about terror plots and the like?  This increased paranoia is neither healthy nor productive.    I have never seen an administration manufacture more hysteria than this one.  They raise the terror level to ORANGE if someone's shoes don't fit right.  They lower it back to YELLOW when they drop a few pounds.  Everything's a crisis.  Everything is a potential terrorist plot.   Sure, I am worried about another strike.  I think it's wholly possible.  And it's our own fault.  Instead of dealing with what happened on September 11 the right way, we have set ourselves up for strikes from more sides than we could have possibly imagined.  We've ruffled feathers and angered nations.  We have gone on the offensive where we had no reason to.  We've become even more of a bully than ever before, and that, along with our excessive lifestyles and abuse of power and money, is what got us into trouble in the first place.  Whatever happened to humility?  Are we destined to be, now and forever, the nation that slaps the hand instead of the nation that holds the hand?    Yeah, I'm scared.  I'm scared of the life that the children of my friends and family will have to lead.  I'm scared of the decisions this administration is making.  If I can be at all hopeful, it is that the next administration will be able to quell some of my fears.    But that doesn't stop the fact that damage has already been done.  Things will never be the same.  I've accepted that as truth, but I don't like it.

      59 Degrees.  Is this really July?  I can't get over how chilly it's been. Where's the heat?  Where's the humidity?  Where's the shirtless men running around everywhere?  I need a vacation.  Oh yeah, that's right-- I'm taking one.  OK granted it's in  urlLink Montreal, Canada , where who knows how cold it will be (I'm no genius at Geography or atmospheric changes in temperature) but it sure will be nice to get away from HERE for a while.  Plus, a nice long break from work would really be nice as well.  I haven't taken too many vacations in the time I've been at  urlLink Jenner & Block  (3 years this past April.)  This is what we call "Hell Week" in the  urlLink Chorus .  They ain't lying.  By the way, have you got your tickets yet?  Off to shower.

      Well here we go.  Thanks to my friend  urlLink Jake , I am off and blogging away!  (Thanks, Jake!)  I trust that if you're reading this, you read my profile and all that, so I won't go into the specifics of who I am, what I do, etc.  But if you haven't, take a gander at my  urlLink profile  and you'll get all that info.  Actually, this isn't the first time I've done something like this.  I had a "blog" of sorts when I first moved to Chicago in 1997.    It's actually funny, because I recently just found all the old HTML files from that old website I used to have online.  To think I actually sat down and created all the layouts and designed logos and everything.  Could I do that again now?  Probably.  Do I want to?  Hell no.  Too much work.  This is much easier.  All the designs and everything are already done.  All I have to do is type, and frankly, I think I do that pretty well.    Now that I've started this, I might just post those old "Diary" pages here, just for fun.  Actually, they paint  quite  an interesting picture of how far I've come since I moved to Chicago.  It was 1997.  I was 26 years old, I had moved out of my parent's house for the very first time, and I was officially "on my own."  How scary was that?  I look at the things I wrote there and I realize how incredibly naieve and "green" I was about a LOT of things.  Thank goodness I'm jaded and bitter like everyone else in this fair city.  OK, maybe I'm not quite that bad, but hey, I  am  still single after 7 years... Hmm.  What is the point of a Blog anyway?  And who decided it should be called Blog?  As if chopping the letters "W" and "E" and smashing the rest of the letters together would make it somehow "hip" or "cool."  (I love "Quotes" can't you "tell?")  I suppose it's a great way of getting to know how someone thinks and feels-- and for that matter, how they write about it!  It's also a great way for me to vent my frustrations and feelings about situations that happen in my everyday life.  It essentially is an online journal.    My original Journal was inspired by someone who I consider to be one of the pioneers of the "Blog".  His name is Justin Clouse, and he currently lives in San Diego, CA.  Although it seems he isn't posting to his diary anymore, he kept it going strong from 1995 until late in 2003.  You can check his site out  urlLink here .  It's getting late and I have a long day tomorrow.  I'm rehearsing with the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus for their Pride show this weekend.  I hope you'll be there... if not, click  urlLink here  and buy some tickets, will ya?    I'll do more posting soon.  See ya then!

       Well I'm just waiting for the cab to come and get me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm on my way to lovely Montreal!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly slept a wink.&nbsp; I spent the whole night packing and cleaning my apartment.&nbsp; Think I'm nuts?&nbsp; Well, there is nothing nicer than coming home to a spic-n-span apartment.&nbsp; And thanks to my busting my ass, I will have just that!  &nbsp;  My friend Rafael is watching Pippin & Screech while I'm away.&nbsp; He's more of a cat freak than I am, so they'll be in good hands.  &nbsp;  So I will see y'all in 10 days.&nbsp; Whoever you may be!  &nbsp;  Drop me a line (a comment would be nifty) and let me know you're out there!  &nbsp;  -Rick

      Fantastic news... thanks to everyone who called their Congresspeople, Senators and other politicos about the preposterous Constitutional amendment to deny marriage rights to gays and lesbians, the amendment was DEFEATED 48 to 50.    George Bush lost this battle-- big time-- and that should have interesting consequences when election time rolls around.    Of course the Repugnantcans won't stop at that.  They'll do everything in their power to make sure that people like me and millions of others are denied as many equal rights as possible.    Quoth The Bushman:  "Activist judges and local officials in some parts of the country are not letting up in their efforts to redefine marriage for the rest of America and neither should defenders of traditional marriage flag in their efforts,"   "It is important for our country to continue the debate on this important issue, and I urge the House of Representatives to pass this amendment,"    Seems the only one who is making this such an "important issue" is the Bushman himself.  And why not?  He has an election to win.  Or so he thinks.  For every step forward there is a step backward.  Expect one soon. But at least the steps forward are GIANT steps, while the steps backward are the tiniest of baby steps.  We will win, but we MUST keep fighting.

      Ditka for Senator.  Can you believe it?  Did we learn nothing from the Schwarzenneger nightmare?  Oh wait, that's right, these are Republicans we are talking about.  I forgot.  So let's see, we have a complete moron as President, who stole the damn office in the first place (thanks to the Supreme Court and the legendary "hanging chad"), who can barely form a complete sentence without rehearsing it first, who was the Governor of one of the largest states in the union (geographical-wise) probably because of his name alone (of course that name wouldn't have influenced  my  decision, but I digress), and who has run our country into the ground financially, diplomatically, and politically.    We also have a completely unqualified actor born in another country who knows nothing more about running a government than the fact that he made millions upon millions of dollars uttering such simple lines as "I'll Be Back" and "It's NOT A TUMOR" in movies as the governor of the largest state in the union (population-wise), elected to office in the greatest circus of an "election" known to man (after the Bush heist).  So, then, in theory, why shouldn't Illinois elect a completely unqualified candidate for Senator, whose claim to fame was one (count 'em) one Super Bowl trophy for Chicago's Bears (Sorry, I'm a Packer fan, so I just don't like the guy anyway), whose speech patterns make Richard Daley look like a Fulbright Scholar, and whose knowledge of politics and making sound decisions lie in his decisions whether or not to play certain linebackers and whether to go for the 1st down or try for a field goal. (Scare ya that I know something about Football?)  Yes, folks, the Republican Party is proving once again that they are truly trying to ruin our country.  Why put qualified people into office when we can push buffoons and rejects to the front of the line to represent us all?    These are scary times, folks.   Please  register to vote, please pay attention to what is going on, and please, I urge you, do what you can to make sure that Bush gets hedged this election year.

       (This story was written in 1995 for my first website.)   - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  I drove over to the Citgo station.  I could see him in the window.  I was quite pleased. =)  I gassed up, drove the car up to the building to park, and got out.  When I walked in, he immediately recognized me.  "HEY!"  he said happily.  "I was hoping you'd stop in!"  My heart leapt with glee.  "I love the box.. I'll keep it... but I wanted to know what you knew about car stereos.."   He proceeded to ask me a bunch of questions  about car stereo equipment... we talked about that for a while... then talked about where he was from... then talked about families.. then talked about music.. .then about TV.. then about God knows what else... I got in there at maybe 10pm.. next thing I knew it was 1am and it was time to close the store!   He closed up, didn't kick me out.... we talked some more about whatever... finally he asked me "So where  do you go out?"   "Well, here and there.. nowhere in particular..." I answered.   "Ever been to a place called 'Club 94'?" He asked. (Club 94 is a gay bar in Kenosha)   "Well.. yeah... once or twice.. it's fun.. .I guess I like it." I answered, getting VERY excited.   He asked me if he could sit in my car while his warmed up (this was about the dead of winter of '92, a VERY cold winter.  He had a Renault.  Need I say more?).  I of course obliged.  He locked up, we got in my car while his ran to warm up and he says,  "OK I'm not gonna bullshit you anymore.  I'm gay."   "Well that's good," I said with a smile,  "because I'm gay, too."   We talked a bit more.. exchanged phone numbers.. and that was it for that night.  We both had to get home.   His name was Donnie.  I was on CLOUD NINE for at least 48 hours after that.   I visited him nearly every day after that.  We'd talk all night long, sit in my car and wait for his to warm up, then go home.  We never would kiss, we never got mushy.. it was just this strange new friendship thing we had.  I felt silly standing around a gas station convenience store for all hours.. and my dad wasn't pleased with it either.. especially because I was there to see a guy!  (My parents knew about me for a while before this)   Anyway about three weeks into my visits with Donnie a friend of his came in and hung out.  I could see that they knew each other pretty well... so at one point I asked him about Donnie.   "How well do you know Donnie?" I asked.   "Why, do you like him?" (he was rather blunt)   "Yes.. why?"   "Well let me just tell you.  You're not his type.  I wouldn't try too hard"   I was crushed.  As far as I knew, he knew Donnie better than anyone else, so I had to trust his word.  Still, I thought that if Donnie didn't like me that much he wouldn't have been talking to me so much and letting me stay so late... I mean, there had to be SOMETHING there.  However, I was very new to the whole gay thing and as far as I was concerned, his friend was right, so I made my visits to the gas station less frequent.   But eventually that changed and I would stop in again just as frequent as before.   One night we went to a bar behind the gas station for a quick drink after he got out of work.  We had known each other for about three months at that point.  I still didn't know what he thought about me, but I knew how I felt about him.  I was falling head over heels in love with Donnie, and it was driving me nuts.   After the bar closed, we sat in my car and talked.  "This is it," I told myself.  "It's now or never".   "Donnie, we've been seeing each other now for about three or four months... and I've really grown to like you .... a lot.  I just want to know... what do you feel?"   "I feel the same way Rick."   "Really?   "Yes."   I then asked him if I could kiss him.  He said yes.  It was the first time I had ever kissed anyone.  And it was wonderful.    Part 3 to come... stay tuned!

      So I'm getting ready for my trip to Montreal!  I leave this Friday for 10 days in sunny (?) Montreal as part of the GALA Choruses VII International Festival in Montreal, Canada.  This is my second GALA, but I've never been to Montreal before, so I'm really excited.    I'm going with CGMC and the Slickers... but I'll have plenty of time to see other choruses (and plenty of the sights as well!)  Yesterday I got some shopping done, printed out all my itineraries (Gotta love Orbitz for the online tix), a map of the downtown area, and got all my paperwork together.  All I have to do now is laundry and pack.  Last night I went online to Gay.com and visited the Montreal room, where I chatted with this super cute boy from Ireland and another from Columbus, OH who saw our chorus when we went to a regional festival in Cincinnati.  I think the super cute one from Ireland wants to meet... I hope so!  He's a hottie!   Anyone Out There?   Hey if you're reading this, how's about ya click on "Comments" and leave one?  I'd love to hear from you.  Let me know what you think.  Am I keeping you interested?  Do you have suggestions?  Do I totally suck?  Do you want to bear my children?  Let me know!

       Please visit  urlLink Moveon.org  to write and send your own letter to the President and your Senators and Representatives.   Dear President Bush, Senators, and Representatives:   As not only a gay man, but also as a citizen of the United States of America, I cannot help but be disturbed by the removal of freedoms from our citizens that is occuring right in front of our faces.  This is shameful and frightening.  Our country was founded on freedom, and by removing the possibility of freedom from one class, group or sect of people, we are deconstructing the very foundation of our nation.  This is wrong, and I urge you to realize it.   I urge you to reject the politics of hate and division.   Everyone has the same rights. There is no place in America for a Constitutional amendment denying marriage equality to anyone.   Sincerely,   Richard L. Aiello, Jr. Chicago, IL

       Donnie was my first love- but he got away.  This is our story.   (This story was written in 1995 for my first website.)   - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  It all started in the winter of 1992....   I was working at a Best Buy in Racine, Wisconsin at the time.  I had a 20 minute drive to get from there to Kenosha, where I was living, and the majority of the drive was along a highway that connected with my street.  As I entered Racine, I would always pass by a Citgo gas station.  On the way home from work, I would frequently stop at this gas station to fill up my gas tank.   One night I stopped and went inside to pay my bill.  There at the counter stood the most adorable, albeit gorgeous guy I'd ever seen.  He had deep blue eyes, brown hair and was about 6' tall.  I immediately knew he was gay... that instinct 'gaydar' we all have... but being rather shy I didn't say too much.  I simply paid my bill and left.   Needless to say my visits to that gas station became all the more frequent.  It seemed that he worked there EVERY night.. so I was almost never disappointed.  Once in a while I'd make small talk.. maybe just smile... he had the cutest Southern accent... I couldn't begin to place where it was from, but that combined with his adorable looks just made him all the more irresistible.   At Best Buy I was a Product Specialist in the Audio Department.  I had been there a few months so I pretty much knew what I was doing.  One day I was at our 'answer center' and I looked up... whom did I see but Gas Station Guy, walking into the boombox aisle. I quickly scooted over there and said "HI".   He recognized me from the visits to the gas station... and smiled.  He wanted to buy a box... so I showed him all the features, gave it to him, and said, "See you around".  That was about it.  I was in bliss.   The next day I was shocked to see that he had returned, with the boombox in hand.  I waited for him to finish at Customer Service, then when he headed toward the boombox aisle again I asked him "Didn't like that one?"   "No, I decided I wanted one with a CD player."   "Well let me show you some that have one."   We talked a little more small talk and I sold him the new boombox.  I couldn't tell if he liked me or not.. and for that matter I couldn't tell if he was gay or not.. but deep down I knew he was.. he just had to be.   That night, I looked at my gas gauge and... what a surprise!  I needed gas! =)    Stay tuned for Part 2...

      The wedding was just lovely.  Like I said, I'd never participated in a gay wedding before.  It was quite a sight.  It was also very multicultural.  The grooms, David and David (yes, how cute.) wore kimono-type outfits, the attendants (Is it a Bridal Party if there is no Bride?) wore tuxes, the ceremony was Irish, Indian and Jewish in influence (replete with the glass breaking and "Mazeltov" at the end), the food was Italian, Vegan and Seafood, and the fashions ranged from the sublime to the casual.  Joan Rivers would have had a field day.  The Slickers sang two of their songs, "Come What May," which I had a solo in, and "Alone in the Universe/Nature Boy."  I also had a solo... the processional song, which was "Someone Like You" from  Jekyll & Hyde .  Unison also sang a set of songs.  So the music was Broadway and Movie influenced.  It was a fun time for all, really, and emotions ran high.  David E, who I am in the Slickers with, read his vows, which borrowed heavily from the lyrics of "Someone Like You."  I was touched by the meaning of the song, which I really hadn't latched onto when I actually sang it.    I'm still living the first verse of the song, up until "Someone Like You" comes along.  Had this moment occurred years ago (around the time of my  urlLink Old Journal  posts) I probably would have become all melancholy and full of regret, wondering if I'll ever find "the one"...    Ok maybe I had a moment or two of that...  But then it passed, and it was time to party!

      No sooner than it starts, it's all over!  The shows on Saturday went fabulously, and although the crowds were modest in the afternoon, they were both very receptive, and we absolutely performed our best.  I was so proud of us (and the others.)    Afterwards was a huge (and I mean HUGE) party at Charlie's Ale House in Andersonville (Yay, just stumbles from home!) and a chance to celebrate our wonderful show.  Indeed, we should all be proud of what we are bringing to Montreal this year.  It will be a very good showing.  Today I am attending my first-ever gay wedding.  In fact, I am singing a song and performing with the Slickers.  The wedding is for the board chair of Windy City Performing Arts.  I'm excited because I get to sing, of course, (where I will get the voice to do it I have no idea) but also because I've always wanted to witness an affair such as this.  Of course it is not a government-sanctioned WEDDING, as those are not truly legal in Illinois (yet), but just the fact that these two people have decided to commit to each other for the rest of their lives and do so in front of friends, family and the like is so wonderful and so moving to me that I could not say no.  Of course this begs the question, what on earth do I wear!?!?  Well it's not happening for a while, and I'm only awake because the cats wanted food.  I will sleep on it further and see what comes to me.

      Sometimes I wonder if I'm posting stuff for my own entertainment.  Maybe I am.   In any case it doesn't look like anyone's reading this thing.  Am I that boring?  Would you rather hear of my sexual escapades?  Oh wait, there aren't any to tell about.  How about my dating life?  Oh yeah, that's right, I don't have one.   I'm sorry, I am just foul and bitter about things lately.   I went to my friend Eric's wake tonight.  It was, to say the least, a very sobering experience.  Three weeks ago I was talking to him.  Now he's gone.   He was only 37 years old.  Ridiculously young.  His body failed him.  Bad kidneys, bad liver.   Why is it that someone so wonderful had to be struck down so quickly?   His family was all there.  Eric was Filipino.  There were family members everywhere.  They loved Eric.  They knew he was gay.  They loved him because he was their son, their brother, their nephew or cousin.   It made me feel even more love and appreciation for him.  I could see where he got his wonderful personality from.   Tomorrow is the funeral, and the Chorus is singing.  I don't know how I'll get through it, but that's what we do-- we sing, even when times are rough and our hearts are broken.  It's the greatest gift we can give to Eric.  He would be so thankful.  As we were for him.  Sorry, I'm overly melancholy tonight.  I actually tried to sit online and coordinate a hookup.  Bad idea.  I'm just not in the mood.  In fact, I haven't been for quite some time.  I just don't want to bother with that anymore.  Too much work, and not enough reward.  What's the point?  If you're reading this (if anyone is) you may have also noticed that I jumped on the "100 Things About Me" bandwagon.  Of course, I added a few "sub-points".   There might be some surprising things in there, there might not be.  But it's all about me.  I'll move them to my other server after a while so they don't clog this page up so much.   Boy is this ever a true RcktRambling.  I'm just spouting out what's in my mind.  Random thoughts.  I guess that makes a true weblog.  Or a journal.  Or whatever you want to call it.   A boy in distress   Cries out for the hand   That comforted him   Throughout his life   From childhood   To adulthood.   He reaches for it,   Finding the air,   And grasps at nothing.   Thing about me #93:  I like to write poetry to clear my mind.

       The same day I got back from Montreal, I found out that one of my friends in the Chorus had died.    &nbsp;  Eric was one of those guys who was always around, and you always expected him to be there.&nbsp; He was quiet, unassuming, and warm.&nbsp; Yet he never wanted anything special.&nbsp; He just was a good person.    &nbsp;  He had a penchant for drag.&nbsp; In fact, he made a knockout drag queen.&nbsp; And he was fiercely talented when it came to makeup.&nbsp; Many of the boys in the Chorus came to him for makeup tips whenever they needed to be done up for&nbsp;a show.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  He had a radiant smile.&nbsp; It lit up the room.&nbsp; And a hearty laugh to back up the smile.    &nbsp;  He wasn't one of my best friends, but he was, indeed, a friend.&nbsp; Four years ago when I was working a dead-end job in retail, he stopped in at the store and we had a long talk about how I wasn't happy with my job and needed to find something new.&nbsp; Eric helped me.&nbsp; He recommended me for a position where he was working.&nbsp; I went in for an interview, but it wasn't the right fit for me at the time.&nbsp; However, hedidn't stop there.&nbsp; He got me in contact with a former co-worker of his who was leaving her position at the law firm she was working at.&nbsp; I interviewed with them, and have been there now for the last 3 years.&nbsp; Without his encouragement and that extra push that he gave me, I might not have made the transition at all.&nbsp; I have Eric to thank for that.    &nbsp;  Having said that, I certainly hoped I appropriately thanked him.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I did, but if not...    &nbsp;  Eric, thank you.&nbsp; You were a true friend.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I will miss you.&nbsp;

       Well I've been at this now for about a month.&nbsp; So far it's pretty fun.     &nbsp;   On one hand, it's given me something fun to do instead of sit on gay chatrooms all night long.&nbsp; On the other hand, I'm still up til all hours reading blogs and posting comments.&nbsp;The rest of the time I'm tweaking this blog, adjusting the template, trying to make it just right.&nbsp; I could use some tips if something&nbsp;looks awry.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, though, I think I'm doing pretty good.    &nbsp;   I put my blog on a couple search engines in hopes that I get some more readers.&nbsp; Question is, will they want to read it?&nbsp; I think I have some interesting things to say and some good stories to tell.&nbsp; There's definitely more to come.&nbsp; What's here is only the beginning... I've got other ideas conjured up, but I can only do so much.     &nbsp;   One thing I have to stop doing is blogging at work.&nbsp; I'm gonna get caught.&nbsp; Can't let that happen.&nbsp; I got a really great review just before I went on vacation (plus a 5% raise.&nbsp; Can't beat that in these times.) So I just have to cool it.&nbsp; It's fun though.&nbsp; I&nbsp;could very easily be a powerblogger.&nbsp; I just need to set the right paramaters and stick to them.     &nbsp;   In the meantime, I'm lonely, I'm horny, I'm bored, and I need some excitement in my life.&nbsp; Oh wait, I'm also poor, at least until the 7th of August.&nbsp; Damn this job's stupid paydates.&nbsp; I need money, and NOW!&nbsp; (Montreal was an EXPENSIVE trip!)     &nbsp;   At least Chorus starts up again in a month.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   God, I'm pathetic! &nbsp;

       The last part of the story of Donnie, my first boyfriend.   (This story was written in 1995 for my first website.)    - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   About a month later I learned that Donnie would be moving to Houston. His mother and sister would be moving back to Atlanta, where they originally came from. I was crushed. I was really falling for Donnie and now he had to leave. We decided that even though he was leaving, we would continue things up until he left, thinking that maybe someday I could move down with him or vice versa.   It killed me to think he would be leaving... but eventually he did.   He was gone for about three months when one day I got a call from him.   "What would you do if came back to Racine?"   I answered, "Well of course I'd be incredibly happy.. but what would you do? You have no job, nowhere to live, and I can't move out because I'm not ready!"   He said, "I could probably figure something out." I figured that was that and left it there.   The next evening I got home from work and checked the answering machine. There was a message.   "Rick, this is Donnie. I'm back in Racine. Give me a call tomorrow at this number.."   I cried.. tears of joy and tears of sorrow. I didn't know where he was or where he was staying. But he was home. And as far as I knew he came back for me.   We saw each other the next day and holding him in my arms was the most wonderful feeling I'd ever felt. He got his job back at the gas station and was living with the owners. I knew that wouldn't last long because he never got along that well with the owners... but for now he was here and that's all that mattered.   We dated for a while but for some reason the magic just wasn't there like it used to be. I became busy with school and then started working in Illinois. He worked every day at the station and we hardly ever saw each other.   Eventually I met another guy and we dated for a while. He was cute, younger, and fun to be with.. but he was 18 (and for some reason that bothered me)...   ...and I wasn't over Donnie.   I broke up with him about two months into our relationship. I told him I loved Donnie. He understood. He was a good guy.   I went to see Donnie the next night. To my shock he informed me that he would be moving to Lexington, Kentucky to live with his father. He wasn't happy in Racine and needed to get out. I was crushed more than ever before. I lost my chance with Donnie.. the guy I truly loved. We made out a bit in the back room and hugged a lot. Then I left.   About halfway down the road from the gas station, I called him on my Cell phone. He was still there. I was crying.   "Donnie?"  "Yes?"  "It's Rick.. .I'm in my car. I was just thinking after I left..."  "What's the matter?"  "I love you, Donnie. I will always love you."  "I love you too, Rick"  "Don't go. Please."  "I have to, Rick.. there's nothing else I can do"   We talked for a little while then I hung up.   I saw Donnie one more time after that. He had a going away party but I couldn't go because I was sick. I cried so much I didn't think I'd have any tears left. He called me from his party. We were both crying. I told him I loved him again. He told me he loved me.   The next day he was gone.. .and I haven't seen him since.   We have kept in touch via phone and mail since then. He now lives in San Jose, CA and has a room mate that he says likes him a lot.. but he's never stopped loving me or thinking about me. Judging from my tears as I type this, I realize that I still love him. Very much. And I always will. Perhaps we were meant to be together, and if so, I hope that someday we can and will be. Until then I hold very precious memories of the times we spent together, and great regret for all the times we could have been together but weren't. We parted against our will. We still have contact.. but it's not enough. I wish he were here now to dry my tears, to hold me and comfort me and tell me everything will be OK. But he's not and I must deal with that. I miss  him. I will always love him.   I guess what I learned from this story is, "You don't know what you've got until it's gone.." as the song says. I never realized just how wonderful Donnie was until I realized he would be gone. Life is unexpected with the way it works. You could be walking down the street, minding your own business, when all of a sudden fate smacks you in the face with a new adventure, a new love, or a new tragedy. All you have to do is keep your eyes open and your senses aware. You never know what will happen next.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   A few months after this was written, I realized I had lost Donnie's phone number. I was pretty devastated, looking all over the place, and even phoning directories trying to find him, but to no avail. One day Donnie phoned me and informed me that he was, indeed dating the man he was living with in San Jose. They had been together for some time and he was happy with him. I was more than happy to hear from him again, and I finally got his phone number and could call him whenever I wanted, but I didn't. I felt it was time to close the wounds from this experience, and I was doing a good job of that already. So I called him very sporadically.   A while later, I heard from Donnie again. He was moving out of the apartment he was sharing with that guy, and they had broken up. He was moving a few blocks away into an apartment with a friend of his. I was slightly happy to hear that, but again I felt like it was useless getting excited about it. He still wasn't going to be moving back anytime soon. He said he'd call me with his new phone number once he got settled into his new place.   I never heard from him again.   Closure has happened. I am over Donnie. Though I will still have a place in my heart for him, as most everyone does when it comes to their first love. I am still single, still looking for someone to fill that space, but I guess I compare everyone to Donnie. That's not fair, but I guess that is an unwritten rule somewhere when it comes to relationships. I had hoped he would call before I moved to Chicago, but he never did. It just wasn't meant to be. And I guess that's just fine. I'll live.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Epilogue, 2004:     Many relationships--one much more serious than Donnie--later, and looking back at what I wrote nearly 10 years ago about him, I see now how young and naieve I was back then about love.&nbsp; Having been through the pain and the sorrow of the ending of a relationship one too many times, I know it never gets easier.&nbsp; But when you're 23 or 24 and still new to everything, it seems like the end of the world.&nbsp;   Donnie was special, though I wonder if I really  loved  him.&nbsp; I'm not so sure now.&nbsp; I still think of him fondly, occasionally,&nbsp;but I don't really know if I understood what love was back then.&nbsp; I think I do now, but I also think that love takes on many different characteristics depending on who he is, what the relationship is based on, and the when, where, why and how you fell for him.&nbsp; The fact that I haven't had a relationship that has lasted over a year probably speaks to my still-evident inexperience in this area.&nbsp; Maybe, hopefully,&nbsp;that will change someday, but it is good to know that I am capable of loving.&nbsp; I know that will never change.   -R

        Montréal,  mon ami , our time was shortened but I had a wonderful time.     &nbsp;   I came home a couple days early due to a lack of funds and a huge dose of homesickness.&nbsp; But that didn't stop me from having a wonderful time and enjoying nearly every second of the trip.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Nearly... well, there were a few moments where I wondered whether my trip was ever going to be a  vacation  and not a whole lot of work. But then it turned around and became everything I had hoped it would be, and more.     &nbsp;   First of all, yes, I did have sex. Once.&nbsp; With one guy.&nbsp; And then it was over.&nbsp; It was fun but it could have been better.&nbsp; Oh well... at least I wasn't completely dry all weekend.     &nbsp;   Second of all, yes, I did have a few lap dances by a few stripper boys.&nbsp;  Oooh la la  are the boys there BEAUTIFUL.&nbsp; Everywhere you turn, another gorgeous man would walk by.&nbsp; Talk about distractions.&nbsp; So why not more sex?&nbsp; Well considering that I am painfully shy in public and have the confidence of a groundhog who sees his shadow around all those hot boys... well, I would probably say that sums it up. &nbsp;   Third, Montreal is not as pretty of a city as I had imagined.&nbsp; It makes Chicago look like the crown&nbsp;jewel of cities.&nbsp; I have never seen so much graffiti in all my life.&nbsp; And if you ever thought the&nbsp;panhandlers and&nbsp;street people of Chicago were bad, you haven't seen&nbsp;(or smelled) the ones in Montreal.&nbsp; Not pretty.    Don't get me wrong, there are parts that ARE pretty, I just&nbsp;didn't get a chance to see&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them.&nbsp; Instead, I took a&nbsp;day trip to Quebec City, and I would have much preferred to stay there.&nbsp; It was gorgeous... romantic, charming, everything I wanted from a destination city.&nbsp; Everywhere you turned was another perfect postcard waiting to&nbsp;be snapped.&nbsp; I will definitely be making a return trip there. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   So anyway, back to GALA..     The premise for the weekend was the GALA Choruses quadrennial festival where all of the LGBT choruses from all over the world who wish to participate come together in one city and present concerts for all of their peers.&nbsp; The larger choruses do the 30-minute sets and small ensembles of the larger groups present the 15 minute sets.&nbsp; I am a member of the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus&nbsp;who did a 30-minute set&nbsp;and the Windy City Slickers who did a 15-minute set.&nbsp; And let me tell you, when you perform in front of literally thousands of people who know what it's like to do what you are doing and appreciate you for coming out and singing your heart out as much as they enjoy doing it, the response is the most gratifying and stimulating thing you will ever hear.&nbsp; It's like being at a rock concert and YOU are the reason they all came and paid $300 a seat to see you.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (Ok so maybe the $300 a seat is a bit excessive, but it's not too far from the truth considering the travel expenses, registration, etc.&nbsp; But I digress...)     &nbsp;   CGMC opened the entire festival, which is a pretty big responsibility to take on.&nbsp; Of course, since there are always two concert blocks going on at any given time, we were up against the Boston Gay Men's Chorus, which also is a very good chorus.&nbsp; But CGMC has opened every one of the last 7 GALA Festivals, so people come to see us.&nbsp; We had a full house.&nbsp; The set was extremely well-received and I heard nothing but raves the entire weekend.&nbsp; In fact, a documentary crew was filming our set and wants to include one of the numbers in the final film.&nbsp; I think that's pretty exciting.     &nbsp;    The Slickers also had a fun set.. although I was  much  more nervous about their set than I was for CGMC, and for obvious reasons... there's only 10 Slickers, whereas there were over 70 guys in CGMC.&nbsp; The same screw-up in the Slickers is seen or heard a lot more clearly than in CGMC.&nbsp; Luckily there were none.      &nbsp;   The rest of the time was spent watching other choruses perform and catching some of the sights, sounds, tastes, and other sensual pleasures of the Montréal/Québec area.&nbsp;     So, here is a list of the most&nbsp;memorable moments (good and bad) during my trip to Montréal:     Performing on stage with  urlLink CGMC  and hearing the audience roar-- numerous times.     Performing on stage with the Slickers and getting such an amazing response.      urlLink Québec City .&nbsp; In a word:  Magnifique .

      So I'm sitting here, putting off my trip north to Kenosha to see my parents.  This is oh-so-typical.  It's not that I don't get along with them-- I do. It's just that I loathe sacrificing my weekend for a weekend of parental bliss. Is that selfish?  Again, please, don't get me wrong, I LOVE my mom and dad. I really do. But sometimes, a little dose is just enough.  This weekend is looking to be a big dose. I'm going up tonight because tomorrow morning we get to do chores all day. That's me, my sister and her husband.  The chores are being planned because we are getting ready to move Mom and Dad out of their house. It's a monumental task. There is nearly 40 years worth of shit in that house. The basement, for years, was a dumping ground. If a toaster broke, we bought a new one. But instead of throwing out the old one, it went in the basement.  Why?  "Someone might need to use it."  HUH!? It's BROKEN! THROW IT AWAY! Nope. There it sat, along with three other toasters, 5 electric frying pans, countless broken pots and pans, a few blenders and even an ancient mixer that my grandma once used.  My parents are pack rats. And they are the worst kind of pack rats-- major junk savers.  So this is round two of junk disposal. Round one was my sister and her husband spending a week in the basement, dumping crap. They filled up three huge dumpsters. THREE. And it's still not done.  Of course, the fact that I wasn't there to help was a major bone of contention. In fact, it caused my sister and I to have a HUGE fight, something we rarely ever do. But it was Pride week... and I told them I couldn't do it that week, but that was the only week that worked for them. So they did it, and I wasn't there.  This weekend we are hitting the garage, which is another post for when I get back. Imagine nearly 40 years of paints, chemicals, and fertilizers. Oh I bet you can. I can't believe the damn thing never blew up.  I need to get going before it gets too late. Wish me luck.

       The recent Superior Court decision in Seattle is passionate and articulate about several reasons why  marriage equality just makes sense.  For those who might be interested, here are some excerpts from King County Superior Court Judge William L. Downing's opinion in Andersen v. Sims:    urlLink (Click here for the full text of the Judge's opinion.)   There was no deeply rooted tradition of interracial marriage at the time of the U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of anti-miscegenation statutes in  Loving v. Virginia , supra; yet, the Court analyzed the issue of their constitutionality in terms of the broad right to marry and found that right to have been infringed.  There was no deeply rooted tradition of marriage while delinquent in child support payments at the time of the U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of statutes prohibiting this in  Zablocki v. Redhail ...(1978); yet, the Court analyzed the issue of their constitutionality in terms of the broad right to marry and found that right to have been infringed.  There was no deeply rooted tradition of inmate marriage at the time of the U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of statutes restricting this in  Turner v. Safley ... (1987); yet, the Court analyzed the issue of their constitutionality in terms of the broad right to marry and found that right to have been infringed....  It is true that marriage has long been defined as the union of one man and one woman. It is equally true that the shape of marriage has drastically changed over the years. It took a very long time for the courts (with legislative bodies sometimes understandably following just a little behind) to break down the traditional stereotypes that relegated women to second class status in society and in the marital relationship....Serving tradition, for the sake of tradition alone, is not a compelling state interest....  Some declaim that the institutions of marriage and family are weak these days and, in fact, stand threatened. Any trial court judge who regularly hears divorce, child abuse and domestic violence cases deeply shares this concern. It is not difficult, however, to identify both the causes of the present situation and the primary future threat.  They come from inside the institution, not outside of it.   Not to be too harsh, but they are  a shortage of commitment and an excess of selfishness.  Before the Court stand eight couples who credibly represent that they are ready and willing to make the right kind of commitment to partner and family for the right kinds of reasons.  All they ask is for the state to make them able....  Of course the laws never have placed a requirement on marriage that the parties procreate nor do they prohibit from marriage those who are unable or disinclined to procreate....  The legal question is not whether heterosexual marriage is good for the replenishment of the species through procreation. It is. The precise question is whether barring committed same-sex couples from the benefits of the civil marriage laws somehow serves the interest of encouraging procreation. There is no logical way in which it does so....It rationally serves no state interest to harm certain...children by devaluing the immediate families that they have joined....  It is good for children to be raised in stable families with a father and a mother. There is not the slightest question about this. It is a situation to be encouraged by the state. But, can it be said that fewer children will have this stability because couples consisting of two men or two women are allowed to have a relationship that is state-sanctioned?  There is no reasonable explanation for why this would be so.  There is no reasonable expectation that, should such a legal result come to pass, married fathers and mothers will abdicate their parental responsibilities or young would-be parents will defect from the ranks of heterosexuals....  On the other hand, when one peers into the future, one circumstance is far more certain to occur. Many, many children are going to be raised in the homes of gay and lesbian partners.... One, then, must try to envision two categories of future children. The first category consists of those whose heterosexual parents will either neglect them or never conceive them because same-sex marriage has been legalized. The second category is those children who will be raised in a home with same-sex adult partners and who would enjoy enhanced fmaily stability and social adjustment if these adults were granted the benefits of civil marriage. The only reasonable conclusion is that the very real second category greatly outnumbers the first theoretical one.  Therefore, the goal of nurturing and providing for the emotional wellbeing of children would be rationally served by allowing same-sex couples to marry; that same goal is impaired by prohibiting such marriages.... Unlike the documented impact of children's exposure to domestic violence and substance abuse in the homes of lawfully married heterosexual couples, as to children raised by intact same-sex couples there is no science, only questionable assumptions based on stereotypes.  The Court concludes that the exclusion of same-sex partners from civil marriage and the privileges attendant thereto is not rationally related to any legitimate or compelling state interest and is certainly not narrowly tailored toward such an interest.   If there is indeed any outside threat to the institution of marriage, it could well lie in legislative tinkering with the creation of alternative species of quasi-marriage....Better, perhaps (in terms of simplicity, fairness and social policy) to allow all who are up to taking on the heavy responsibilities of marriage, with its exclusivity and its "till death do us part" commitment, to do so - not lightly, but advisedly.... The privilege of civil marriage and the various privileges legally conferred by that status are not being made equally available to all citizens.... [In addition, the] denial to the plaintiffs of the right to marry constitutes a denial of substantive due process.   [T]hese plaintiffs...include exemplary parents, adoptive parents, foster parents and grandparents. They well know what it means to make a commitment and to honor it. There is not one among them that any of us should not be proud to call a friend or neighbor or to sit with at small desks on back-to-school night.  There is no worthwhile institution that they would dishonor, much less destroy....The characteristics embodied by these plaintiffs are ones that our society and the institution of marriage need more of, not less.    Beautifully spoken words. Your thoughts?

      OK, this creeped me out. A bit too close to home, folks.     Dirksen Federal Building   Chicago, IL   Photo ©  urlLink Chicago Tribune      Ill. Man Accused of Courthouse Bomb Plot   By NATHANIEL HERNANDEZ Associated Press Writer    Published August 5, 2004, 5:03 PM CDT    CHICAGO -- A convicted counterfeiter with an apparent grudge against the courts was arrested Thursday on charges of plotting to blow up a federal courthouse, but he never actually had materials to make a truck bomb, authorities said.  Prosecutors said Gale William Nettles, 66, was arrested with a pickup truck containing 1,500 pounds of fertilizer that he allegedly thought was volatile ammonium nitrate, the farm chemical used to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building.  Nettles had planned to sell the chemical to terrorists who would blow up the Dirksen federal building, U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald said in announcing the charges Thursday. But all the other people involved, including the "terrorists" and the people who sold him the fertilizer, were cooperating witnesses or federal agents, Fitzgerald said.  Nettles told the undercover agent he could make a 3,000-pound fertilizer bomb.  "He had a rational plan to build a bomb. We weren't going to wait to see if it would work," Fitzgerald said.  Timothy McVeigh used a bomb made of 4,800 pounds of ammonium nitrate to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people.  Nettles was arrested at a park early Thursday with the pickup truck when he met the undercover agents who he thought were terrorists, according to the criminal complaint. The fertilizer he obtained in the sting does not have the explosive potential of ammonium nitrate.  According to the complaint, Nettles met July 26 with an undercover agent he thought was a member of a terrorist group. In a recorded meeting, Nettles said he had a half ton of ammonium nitrate in New Orleans that he could have in Chicago in two days and that he had a target in mind -- the U.S. courthouse downtown, the complaint said.  A federal magistrate Thursday ordered Nettles held until a detention hearing Tuesday. No plea was entered, and defense attorney John Theis declined to comment afterward.  Nettles was released from prison in 2003 after serving time for counterfeiting and apparently retained a grudge against the court system, Fitzgerald said. The Dirksen federal building in downtown Chicago houses federal criminal and civil courts and the U.S. attorney's office.  Fitzgerald said Nettles was not working with any other groups but had asked cooperating witnesses about contacting Al-Qaida and Hamas.  Nettles also had a previous conviction for armed robbery in Cook County and was on parole at the time of his counterfeiting arrest. In 2001 he claimed he had mental disabilities, according to court documents.  "He's 66 and he's spent -- probably conservatively -- 45 of those years in prison," said attorney Ronald J. Clark, who represented Nettles in the counterfeiting case. "It surprises me that Gale would seriously be involved in something of this magnitude," Clark said. He described Nettles' counterfeiting as a "fairly pathetic attempt."  Nettles had been living at a transient hotel in Chicago since his release following the counterfeiting sentence, authorities said. Sam Gelles, 35, another hotel resident, said Nettles was an introverted computer whiz who went by the nickname "Pops." "You couldn't really read him," Gelles said.

      My department manages the website for our Firm. It's usually a pretty easy task, and doesn't require much participation by me or my co-workers. There are those who have the duty of updating the content, and that's their job. Aside from formatting an image or two a day, I don't have much involvement.  So yesterday, we posted a story on the website. When this happens, an Email is sent out to the department and all involved attorneys about the posting.  Well damn it if the floodgates didn't open up.  Something was apparently VERY wrong.  First one partner REPLIES ALL and says he found an error. Then ANOTHER partner does the same thing. Then ANOTHER. Soon they're having a virtual E-chat about the error. And my mailbox is piling up with these pointless, annoying E-mails that have absolutely NOTHING to do with me whatsoever.  And it didn't stop there. After they got the problem resolved, they proceeded to banter. And let me tell you, attorneys who banter are NOT FUNNY in the slightest. Oh they try... but oh, they fail.  Meanwhile, my mailbox was bursting at the seams. My "New Message" indicator popped up so many times I was about to scream. I wanted to REPLY ALL to everyone in 72 point lettering "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MAKE IT STOP!"  When all was said and done, I had nearly 20 Emails on the said subject. Don't these people have billable hours to worry about? And don't they know how to reply to one, and NOT to all? It's not just that we aren't involved... we just don't CARE!  Besides, I have much more important things to do with my time... like bitch about things like this on my blog.  Silly people.

       This post was originally a comment to a post by  urlLink Hot Toddy . (click the link to read his post.) But it was too long for a comment, so I'm posting it here in its entirety...    Wow what's with all of us getting reflective lately?  I know when I first moved to Chicago, I wanted to get away from the quiet, rural life of Kenosha (a/k/a Kenowhere) Wisconsin and plop myself right in the middle of a big city, with bright lights, big buildings and all kinds of crazy people everywhere I turned. I got what I wished for. I moved to an apartment in a not-so-great area that had an incredible view of the skyline. Every morning I woke up and looked at it and thought "Damn, I finally live here!"  After a while, the novelty wore off. I missed grass and trees. I missed sidewalks that weren't caked in beer bottles and litter. I missed kids riding bikes and laughing and the feel of a neighborhood. The area I lived in didn't have that. It was a concrete jungle, and I was in the heart of it.  I looked around and found a great neighborhood that had what I was looking for. Then I found a friend who needed a roommate. And I made my move.  Now I live alone in the same neighborhood, and for all intents and purposes, I still have what I was hoping for. It's quiet, I feel safe, I look out my window and see birds and trees and people doing things... that remind me of home.  You never give up who you are. You may supress, and even reject a little of it. But it's always a part of you. And wherever you go, and in whatever you do, and in the people you meet and make friends with, you find more parts of yourself. That's one of the joys of life.  I like it when you get sentimental. It reminds me of someone I know quite well. :-)

       Like the smallest pebbles   The drops of rain fall   Gently and soothing   Upon the windowsill.   As the wind blows,   They change direction,   Spattering against the glass.   Cleaning away the grime   Of a city caked in dust.   Bright white flashes of light   Brilliantly flare in the sky   As the sound of thunder   Crashes against the walls   And shakes them to their core.   I sit quietly in my room   And close my eyes   And imagine myself   Drenched in rainfall.   The wild weather's wrath   Encircling me in fury.   Washing me clean.   For the water cleanses   My soul and senses.   And as the rain subsides   So do I return   To everyday life.   -RA

      Bzzzzzzzz  Bzzzzzzzz    Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz    I went to bed VERY late the night after I got back from Montreal. I must have been wired still from the trip, even though I was completely broke (still am) and painfully exhausted. Nonetheless, I had blogging to do and guys to cruise. I had to catch up!  Very early the next morning, I was awakened by my doorbell. I remember wondering if I had forgotten about plans I had made with a hot boy and quickly started to grab the essentials-- lube, rubbers, etc...  But first I had to answer the door. I was more than half-asleep still, but I made it. It was the Fed Ex guy delivering a package to me. (Insert crass remark here.)  I buzzed him in and he left it on my front doorstep. I must not have been fast enough. (Or I fell asleep again somewhere in between the buzzing in and opening the door.) Before I went back to bed I opened the package... it was from my friend in NYC who's moving to Australia-- an American Pride Flag. How cool!  She left me a nice note.  I read it, still groggy and nodding off.  So I went back to sleep.   I don't know where I'm going to hang/fly this thing.  I live in a half-courtyard apartment building with no flagpole.  I already have an American Flag that I bought after 9/11 that is still folded properly and put away for the same reason.  But it's cool.  I'll definitely keep it and treasure it... and someday I'll use it.

      In  urlLink Gay Bloggers  on  urlLink Tribe.net  today, we are discussing a fellow blogger  who recently quit his blog because someone was hurt by something he said.  It rang home pretty true to me.  I've been down that road before.  If you've perused my blog anytime before, you know that from  urlLink 1997-1998 , I kept an online journal.  I started it when I was getting ready to move to Chicago and I let it chronicle pretty much everything that happened to me from the time I found out about the job and the move to the actual move into the city, to my adjusting to life there.  I probably didn't even put that much thought into it then, but reading it now, it's interesting to see what was going on in my head at the time.  Even though it was only a 6 years ago, I was in such a different place than I am now... a very different mindset.  I stopped posting to the journal because someone I cared about was upset about something I had posted.  I realized that I was venting TOO much of my emotions.  I was being mean.  I was expressing anger through my words.  When it got back to me that those words really hurt someone, I stopped.   I didn't do any type of journal until I started my blog just this past month.  The pages of my old journal are linked on my blog now.  I find them fascinating and read them from time to time-- maybe to recapture some sort of "Newness" that life had back then, or maybe to remember some of the really good times I had.  (Oddly enough, sometimes I have a hard time remembering people and details.  Time does march on.)  I want this blog to be more about me than the old journal was.  That was essentially just a diary without "Dear Diary" before every posting.  I like the blog concept because you can really share yourself more-- your likes and dislikes, your fears and your joys, and of course, the funny, crazy moments in life.  I hope that nobody ever gets hurt by anything I say here... as that's never the intention.  But a wise woman once said, "Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke"...   Or just fuck 'em... that would be nice too...  If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go wash out my potty mouth and go to bed now.  Gnite.

      Sex! Lies! Passion!  Oh I could be such a smutmonger if I wanted to be. Alas, aside from a few failed attempts online, there was no sex to be had. Sorry.  However, there were plenty of flirtations at  urlLink Sidetrack  last night.  I met up with Rafael, my friend who watched my cats while I was in Montreal, for some drinks and showtunes. I also had plans to meet a guy I had been chatting with on AOL for the last few days. So I had plenty of bases covered.  I ran into AOL Guy first, and he offered to buy me a drink. First impressions being what they are, he was attractive, but he didn't stop me in my tracks. I greeted him with the customary hug and said I was also looking for a friend and would be back in a minute. He said he'd wait for my return.  I found Rafael in the adjoining room and told him about the AOL guy. Of course, he accused me of being the "Second string" guy to the AOL Guy, but I assured him that he clearly was main reason I was there.  So back to AOL Guy, who by this time had downed a few too many bottles of Miller Lite. He was attractive in a baked-in-the-sun-too-long kind of way, and nice enough. So I accepted his drink (also a Miller Lite, not my favorite, but I wasn't going to complain at the prospect of free alcohol) and chatted a while. He introduced me to some of his friends (Thing about me #101 - I am horrible at remembering names.) and watched videos and boys and that was about it.  Eventually Rafael found us and I introduced Rafael to AOL Guy (more to the point, I said "This is my friend Rafael" and let Rafael introduce himself. I admit, I forget the guy's name. I am so lame.) Also in the group was Richard, another Chorus guy. I sort of wedged myself between Raf & Richard, keeping AOL Guy at bay.  But then he made his move.  First his hand was on my ass... then wrapped around my back, then he was getting all touchy feely in ways that I wasn't too comfortable with. Now don't get me wrong, normally, I wouldn't mind being touchy feeled in public if it was with someone I liked or was really interested in.  However, this quickly was not becoming the case with (Increasingly Drunken) AOL Guy.  Finally he had me from behind, wrapping his arms around my waist and tickling me. I'd had enough. I was facing Rafael and said "Help!"  He didn't hear that one, and (I.D.) AOL Guy had me in a Half-Nelson chokehold sort of thing on the floor at this point. I pleaded a little louder, "HELP!"  Rafael suggested we go to the roof deck. I gladly obliged.  (I.D.) AOL Guy seemed disappointed, but at that point I didn't care. I told him I'd be right back. (Oops!)  He caught me later on, and looked dejected, slurring his words. By now he was simply Drunken AOL Guy.  Drunken AOL Guy: "Sscho, what'sss wrong?"   Me: "Well I was just a little uncomfortable. You were a bit too touchy-feely for me."   D.A.G.: "Oh... I'm sschorry"   M: "Don't worry about it."   *lengthy, uncomfortable pause*  D.A.G.: "Well, I sschould prob'ly go ffind my ffriendssss"   M: "OK, bye!"     And that was the last I saw of Drunken AOL Guy.  After I got rid of him, I ran into Terence, who is someone I have always had a crush on (and slept with a few times as well). He was being overly flirtatious. I was being overly receptive. But Raf was around and I didn't want to be a complete whore and forget about him, so I controlled myself. And then he went home. Dammit.  Then, I ran into Jonathan.    Backstory:   Jonathan is this studly dude that I met at a party a few months earlier. He's Chicago born n' raised, and I initially thought he was straight, only to find out (to my pleasant surprise) that he was gay after talking to him for a while. We shared a kinship over our mutual friend's record collection. (That's LP's, not CD's.) But, just when I was developing the hots for him, he mentions his boyfriend.  DAMMIT.  Anyway, we exchanged Emails and kept in touch for a while, but lost touch after a bit.  A few days ago, he Emailed me again, and said he was moving up near me. I thought that was curious, since I knew he lived with his partner. But I didn't pry. He also mentioned a roommate that he hardly knows. I grew even more curious. We agreed to go to a Cubs game together in a couple weeks (Gay Days at Wrigley) so I felt a glimmer of hope.  Then I ran into him last night.  Turns out that he has, indeed, broken up with his (now-ex) boyfriend, who turned out to be a psycho (don't they all?) and a loser (speak the truth, brother) and a user (AMEN!) In fact, he just got done moving into his new closet of an apartment and stopped by the bar for a few drinks. And there I was to comfort him.  I know what you're thinking.   You: Comfort him means bring him home to have your way with him, you floozy.   Me: Who, ME?   You: Yeah, you... you'd be online looking for sex anyway, and now it's fallen RIGHT IN YOUR LAP (so to speak)!   Me: I think you have me confused with someone else.  I had no such intentions. Honestly. But we did spend the rest of the night together at the bar, talking about bad Ex experiences and sharing life stories. And making catty comments about people and videos playing at the bar. It was fun. And we  are  getting together to see the Cubs game in a couple weeks. So the night was not a bust, at all.  Even though I went home alone and sat online for another 3 hours.  I am a good boy... honest!

      Oy.  I just woke up.  It's nearly 11:45.  I had another one of those "can't-sleep-because-I-need-sex-but-I'm-not-getting-it-so-why-am-I-wasting-my-time-online" nights last night.   That coming after a day where my emotional rollercoaster was going higher and doing more hairpin turns and loop-de-loops than ever before.   OK, I was a mess yesterday.   First it was Eric's funeral.  That would do it to anyone, right?  It was a nice service, held in the big Catholic church just steps away from Boystown.  I'd always passed by the place but never gone in... being the good ex-Catholic that I am.  The service was nice, but again, it was oh-so-typically Catholic.  Long.  Lots of standing and sitting.  Communion.  The usual drill.  Communion struck me as odd.  All these gayboys were going up and getting Communion.  I had to wonder how many of them actually do the "right Catholic thing"-- go to Confession (now called "Reconciliation,") and tell all of their sins to a Priest.  If I had to do that, I'd keep the poor old guy there for a week.  It's not worth it.  Might as well let him eat and sleep and do the things he needs to do, rather than sit there and listen to me blather on.  (And starve to death in the process.)  A few of us joked (predictably) that we were suprised that we weren't struck down by lightning when we walked in the church.  Yes, it's an old one, but it's still effective.  So anyway, the service was nice, the  urlLink Chorus  sang (although we didn't sing our first choices-- the songs had to be religious or Biblical in theme or we couldn't sing them.  Luckily in our last concert there were two such songs ready to go, or would couldn't have sung anything.  Catholics.)  I was touched by the large number of people that came to pay their respects to Eric.  So was his family.  While I was extremely sad, this warmed my heart greatly.  I was honored to have known someone who made so many wonderful friends.   Then I started thinking, "How well-attended will my funeral be?"  Boy what a downer.  After the funeral we had lunch at  urlLink Ann Sather's , a popular restaurant not far from the church.  The Chorus was supposed to sing again but we decided it would be inappropriate so we didn't.  So we paid our final respects and moved on to  urlLink Sidetrack  for the video viewing party for the Chorus's spring show, "Low Hanging Fruit."  Talk about a shift in emotion.  Now we were all together and laughing and having a fun time.  But I was still in one of my moods.  I wasn't feeling overly social.  I enjoyed myself, but I had no money with which to buy a drink, so I didn't have one.  I felt out of place.  I actually thought about leaving a few times, but I stayed until the end.   When I got home, I decided I was "in for the night."  I was supposed to go to a couple more parties (one hosted by old friends of mine that I haven't seen in a long time) but I just wasn't up for it.  Instead, I made dinner, played with the cats, and sat online.   I'm still in a funk today.  I need to snap out of this.   I know my friends are probably at the beach.  I should maybe go and see if they are there.  Or maybe not.  See how conflicted I am?  What should I do?   And I still have no money.  I won't for another week.  Damn that trip to  urlLink Montreal  for being so damned expensive.  Oh look...  urlLink Manhunt ....

      Last night, I met another AOL Boy out for drinks at Sidetrack.  As you may recall, I had a disastrous outing with the  urlLink last such AOL-type guy .  This time was not much different. Aside from the drunken part.  This time, the meetee (I being the meet-er) was much younger... 9 years younger than me in fact. Except he should have been 19 years younger. He was young in just about every way possible... as in naive. As in he still lives with his parents. As in he just wasn't right for me.  I've been chatting with this boy for probably over 4 years on AOL.  We haven't necessarily been the greatest, closest of chat buddies.  I would sign on, he'd say "Hi, how are you?" and I'd say "Fine thanks" and trade a few updates and that'd be it.  I should have known meeting him would be a bad idea.  When we would chat, he would get frustrated if I didn't respond right away, and would get upset if I didn't have much to say.  He always would try to pry information out of me (or so I thought.)  To be honest, I found him irritating.  But yet, I was cordial and always nice to him.   I knew he had a crush on me.  I don't mean that to sound arrogant or anything... it's just a feeling I had.   Apparently I was right.  A few nights ago, he caught me online again.  The same banal conversation ensued, and finally he said, "When are we going to meet?"  I must have been tired or weak or whatever.  I said, "How about Thursday?"   So we agreed to meet at Sidetrack at 10 PM.  I know what you're thinking right now.   "Rick, how evil of you.  Leading this poor kid on.  You knew you weren't interested in him.  Why put him through this?"   Uh-uh.  I am not evil.  I just wanted to get this over with.  Is that evil?  I don't think so.  Maybe he would end up being a sweet guy, and I'd fall madly in love with him and we'd live happily ever after.  Or not...  Thursday arrived, and I got home from work on time.  I was tired, still feeling lousy, coughing, sneezing, sniffling, overall feeling miserable.  I didn't want to go.   He called at 9:15 PM.  "What are you doing?"   "I'm making dinner, what are you doing?"   "I just got done with work...  I was wondering if you wanted to do something 45 minutes early."   "Uh... no... I am going to make dinner first."   "Oh... ok...." he sounded dejected already. (Oh great.)   "I'll meet you there between 10 and 10:30.. ok?"   "OK, see you there."  (OK... I REALLY didn't want to go now.)  I finished dinner, got changed and checked a few messages online (Damn that Tribe for being so addictive!)  He called at 10:30 right on the nose.  "Where are you?"   "I was just about to leave..."   "OK, I'm here."  I had no choice.  I was committed.  I had to go now.  So I got there and we met, finally.  OK.  He is a nice guy.  But he's just not my type.  Like I said, he's very young.  He's very naive.  Comparatively, I have been around the block... many,  many  times.   It was Comedy Night at Sidetrack.  He had never been before.  (He lives out in Crystal Lake, a very far-away suburb, with his PARENTS.)  I had to explain most of the routines being shown to him.  He either didn't get the humor or had never heard of half of them.  (Thankfully he knew Mommie Dearest, or I would have had to have left.  Immediately.)  Then he got touchy-feely.  You may recall  urlLink the last time this happened .  I didn't like it then and I didn't like it this time either.  In no way was I giving him the signals that I was at all interested in being touchy-felt.  Yet he persisted.  An arm around the shoulder, a touch on the back, a hug at a moment that didn't really need a hug.  Standing MUCH too close.   He was like a puppy that craved attention.  And I wasn't in the mood for another pet.  Now don't get me wrong.  I wasn't mean to him or anything.  In fact, I tried to keep the conversation going and keep things as light as possible.  But he must have sensed that I wasn't in the mood to be... snuggly.  So he got self-conscious and finally said,  "Am I making you uncomfortable?"   "Well... in a way, yes.  I came here to meet you... but I'm not comfortable with the touchy-feely stuff."   "OH ok.. I'm so sorry."  He immediately got distant and self-conscious.  I felt bad... for a minute.  And then I decided it was getting late and I had to go home.  So I said good night, gave him a hug goodbye, and left.  In hindsight, maybe I should have been up-front and said  "Look, I'm not really looking to date you.  I just am here to meet you as a friend.  I don't want to give you the wrong idea.  I hope that's ok."       But I didn't do that... and now I feel a little guilty.  And why is it that these guys that I'm not so interested in are so touchy-feely but guys that I'm ga-ga over want nothing to do with me?  Men are so damn confusing.   Of course, I don't help that situation any by being so ... me.   ARRRGH.

      I feel like a steamroller flattened me today.  And yet I still went to work. Bleah.  The weather hasn't helped much. It got up to a blistering 63 degrees today. Brrrr! Talk about a chilly August.  I'm coughing and hacking up lungs left and right. Now ain't that a pretty sight? :-)    OOOH I forgot something cool to tell you!    This weekend I'll be with the  urlLink Chicago Gay Men's Chorus  as we sing the National Anthem at the  urlLink Chicago Cubs  game!  Yup that's right, we sing the National Anthem before the Cubs vs. Dodgers game at 12:20 PM CDT on Saturday, August 14 at beautiful  urlLink Wrigley Field .  This will be the second time we will have done this-- the first time was September 27, 2003, at a certain double-header game where the Cubs clinched the division title for the first time in 14 years. And after we sang, we got to see BOTH games! It was an awesome experience. Here's a few pics of that glorious event!   urlLink    Lining up to go in and SING! (That's me front and center. I was the first one to walk on the field. It was INCREDIBLE.)   urlLink    Oh say can you see....   urlLink    There were 90 of us there-- the most that's ever sung the National Anthem at Wrigley. And the FIRST Gay-identified group, ever.   urlLink    Our name up in lights on the Scoreboard!  Pictures posted by   urlLink  Hello       So anyway, if you have cable and get Fox Sports, watch for us... Saturday, August 14 at 12:00 PM CDT. We might just be on TV :) (We were televised last time.)  OK that's all the big wonderful news I had to post... back to my regularly scheduled boring life. :-P

      So I was home sick from work today (really.)  I was hungry, so I went to make some toast.  OH NO!  No bread in the house.  So what's a housebound sick boy to do?   urlLink     urlLink    Posted by Hello   Mmmmmm :)  Nothing like freshly baked bread to cure the pangs of hunger. :)  And it was damn tasty too.

      Could you imagine? Ew...       Bus waste scuttles boat tour    By Angela Rozas and Brett McNeil   Tribune staff reporters    Published August 9, 2004    At the outset of a Chicago River boat tour Sunday, Capt. Sonja Lund deadpanned that passengers should not look up with their mouths open when passing under the city's grated bridges, lest they get a true "taste of Chicago."  About 15 minutes later, passengers got more than that. They got a deluge when the boat was doused with a foul "liquid substance" that appeared to drop from one or two charter buses as the boat passed under the Kinzie Street bridge, passengers and tour officials said.  Witnesses said they had just begun the Chicago Architecture Foundation's 1 p.m. tour when they passed under the bridge and a cascade of a "brownish-yellow" substance rained on them. About two-thirds of the passengers seated on the upper deck of Chicago's Little Lady were soaked. Passengers said they looked up to see at least one, possibly two charter buses rumbling above.  A volunteer tour guide at the boat's helm reassured passengers that they had been splashed with water. But the foul smell prompted suspicion.There was "stunned silence initially. Then sort of this horrible realization as they began to smell themselves as to what happened," said Steedman Bass, 35, of Boston, who was a passenger on the boat but was not sprayed. "It was horrific."  Passengers shouted that police should be called and demanded the boat be turned around. Within minutes, the tour headed back to the dock at Michigan Avenue and Lower Wacker Drive, speeding as "fast as the boat would go," Lund said.  Some passengers became sick from the smell and made use of the boat's lower-deck bathrooms, Bass said.  At the dock, the 120 passengers disembarked and were given refunds for the $25 tickets, exchanges or open-ended tickets for later tours. Some were given cab fare to get back to hotels and some passengers' dry-cleaning bills will be paid, foundation officials said. The boat's crew swabbed the deck clean and set off only slightly delayed for the 3 p.m. tour.  "We feel very badly for these people who have had this day's event ruined," said Bastiaan Bouma, vice president of marketing and tours for the foundation. In 50 years of operation, the tour has never experienced something like this, he said.  "Obviously, this wasn't our fault. But we were just trying to make it as comfortable for the passengers as possible."  Bouma said that he was told that someone recorded license plate numbers from the bus or buses and reported the plates to police. He said he hoped to know the name of the company by Monday morning and would demand the company's buses be inspected for defects.  "Tomorrow morning we'll find out what buses were involved, and hopefully we'll get some answers," he said.  Police confirmed a report had been made, but said it was not being investigated as a crime.  A local tour bus company official said he had never heard of a bus unloading liquid waste into the river from a bridge. Charter bus companies typically contract with disposal companies to get rid of their waste or dump it at their own disposal sites, he said.  Passengers said they were shocked at the awful timing of the improbable hit."If you tried to orchestrate this, it would be an almost impossible scenario," Bass said.

      I've found a new talent for myself.  The topic  du jour  on  urlLink Tribe  lately is... "If They Had A Blog."  People are posting names of people they think would have interesting blogs.. if they kept one. Common ones are Salvador Dali, Oscar Wilde, Nelson Mandela (the attention whore, as  urlLink Toddy  says,) Janeane Garafolo, and countless others.  Yet one name caught my eye... and my imagination. (Thanks to  urlLink EViLL ) - Jesus Christ.  What would Jesus's blog read like? Fascinating stuff.  EViLL started it off:      "Woke up. Washed feet. Learned I could walk on water - how cool is that? Wept. Said 5 Hail Marys and she was all like, "I heard you the first time, Jesus Christ!"       I found that funny... so I added my $.02      "Went in the fridge and there was nothing there but some cold fish and a stale loaf of bread. I was freaking out because I had people coming over in an hour. So I just talked to Dad and next thing you know, the whole fridge was full-- all kinds of fish and enough bread to feed a multitude. Had to fill bushels with the extra. It was nuts. Sometimes Dad doesn't think about leftovers. Oh well, at least my friends were full."      I instantly saw my  urlLink Hell-Score  go up 50 points. And a new inspiration was born. I couldn't be stopped. So I decided to ghost-write for a few more "famous folks"...   Joan Crawford      "Got up at 12:30 AM. Started weeding roses. Decided they were in my way, so I chopped them down. Yelled at Christina. (She's so insolent.) Drank a fifth of gin to ease the pain. Strangled Christina because she was obstinate. Sent her to boarding school. I love my children, really I do..."       Bette Davis      "Woke up, smoked a cigarette, went for a drive in Beverly Hills, went shopping. Smoked another cigarette. Fought with my daughter. Pissed off a few media types, but hell, I don't care. Went on Letterman and put him in his place. Still waiting for my next movie deal..."       Martha Stewart      "Guards woke me up. I told them a nice pleasant "Good morning" is sufficient, but they insist on banging on the rails of my cell. Rude. All we had for breakfast was oatmeal. I wish I could add a sprig of fresh mint at least to make it presentable. These people know nothing about presentation. *sigh*..."

      I got home around 2:00 from Mom and Dad's and quickly got ready.  This weekend was Halsted Street Market Days.  In Chicago, there are three weekends that are considered "Gay High Holy Days." One is IML Weekend (International Mister Leather) which is always Memorial Day weekend. The second is Pride weekend (The last weekend in June) and the third is Halsted Street Market Days.  For those who have never been to this conglomeration of shirtless men and tacky merchandise, Market Days is the largest street festival in the City of Chicago. It occurs every August, usually the first or second weekend. It happens on Halsted Street, between Addison and Belmont. Yes, that's right in the heart of Boystown.  For two days, the street is closed off and the show begins. Shirtless men, Hetero and Homo, adorn every nook and cranny of the street. Peddlers from far and wide display their wares-- some cool, most tacky, never cheap. There's music stages, featuring artists who are up-and-coming and a few that are definitely has-beens. (This year's highlight was  A Flock of Seagulls . Really.)  And then there's the food. Chicken on a Stick is popular, as is hand-shaken lemonade, and of course, BEER. Plenty of booze to go around.  Add in a dose of (usually) potent sunshine and steamy temperatures, and you have a weekend of sights, sounds and smells that is quite remarkable.  So I dashed onto the El to make it in time for some prime viewing. This is people-watching central folks. The men are something to see. It's as if they come out of the woodwork for this event, proudly displaying a summer's worth of tanning at the beach and action at the gym. You can't sneeze without seeing another bronzed specimen waddling past, his arms too big to hold down to his sides. Oh yes, this is definitely another parade.  I ran into a few friends of mine and then made it to the booth for the  urlLink Chorus . This is the Chorus's prime recruiting time. We hawk new members, season subscriptions, potential donors, and people to add to our mailing list at Market Days. Without this, it'd be hard to continue adding  fresh meat  new members each year.  So my initial reason for going was to help out at the booth. Yet upon arriving, I could see that things were well under control. So I stuck with my friends and we proceeded to drink, eat, and be merry with everyone else.  What's sometimes disturbing (and amusing) is the lack of control people have over their alcohol consumption. It's my theory that alcohol and hot sunny sweltery days do not mix. People are stumbling over themselves, throwing up, and getting into fights left and right. It's amusing in a repulsive sort of way. Some people just don't know their limits.  One particular gentlemen accosted us verbally as we were leaving the festival. We were standing on a corner waiting for the light to change, when he slurred "Get outta my way... move it, please"  We didn't say anything. To him.  The light changed. We started to cross the street.  "Yeah, Go Kerry. Get that fucking Bush outta office" he blurted, after seeing one of us wearing a "Kerry for President" sticker.  "Yes, that's right, ok, thank you sir," we said, as we continued to walk past him.  "Yeah you fuckers, better vote. Yeah..." he kept on going.  I turned around and shouted, "Don't drink and walk!"  We exploded in hysterical laughter.

        Cubs Game    The Cubs game went off just fine.  We had over 70 guys this time, and once again made an amazing impression on the fans and on the Cubs organization.  Pics are coming soon, I'm just too lazy to get them all formatted and ready for posting.     The only thing that sucked about it was... well.. two things:  1. They announced us... and showed our name on the scoreboard... as the Chicago Gay Men's CHOIR.  (As opposed to CHORUS.)  2.  We weren't on TV or the radio.  BUMMER.  Now mind you, the Choir/Chorus thing doesn't COMPLETELY suck... because: a.  They at least announced as and showed our name as Chicago  GAY MEN'S  Choir.  That is what's important. b.  Nobody booed, nobody sneered.  But EVERYBODY cheered!   It was a gorgeous day, and the Cubs won AGAIN.  So I think we have to consider ourselves lucky... and good luck to the Cubs.  Can't wait til we do it again next year!   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    More Strange Happenings in the Online World   I had THE most bizarre chat with someone today.  I have no idea who this person even was.  But it was just... WEIRD.  Read on:    Strange Guy:  hey       Unsuspecting Me:  Hey        SG:  whats up       UM:  Not much       SG:  koolio       SG:  do you have a kitty?       UM:  Yeah, two       SG:  aww i have 1       UM:  Cool       SG:  do you have any other pets       UM:  Nope       SG:  kool  i have 21 rats       UM:  (Inside Voice) [What the  FUCK!?!? ]  (Outside Voice) wow       SG:  yeah i had a suprise litter....a huge litter lol       SG:  they look like little puppy dogs       SG:  the grandma rat has a crush on my cat and chases him around   And that is where the chat -- with this bizarre, freaky, wacko guy that should be in a movie with the theme song sung by a young Michael Jackson-- ended.  Hello Twilight Zone.  Yikes.     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   The Summer of Sad News Continues      We got the news today that another Chorus member has passed away.        Bill wasn't a close friend of mine or anything... he'd been a member for many years.  But he never looked very well.  He hadn't been around much lately either.  So the news of his passing didn't come as a huge surprise.  Still, after  urlLink Eric's  passing so recently, it is going to be a somber reconvening of the Chorus come September.       - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Random Ramblings         •  I just love the   urlLink  Olympics   .  All those hot studly little short gymnastic men.  All those swimmers in their short shorts and bikini bottoms.  Why it's enough to make a boy get ... a little hot & bothered... ;)      •  I'm meeting with fellow bloggers   urlLink  Palochi   ,   urlLink  NoFo    and   urlLink  Andymatic    on Monday at Sidetrack for a few drinks 'n Showtunes.  I already know Palo and NoFo but I haven't met Andy yet.  It's the first "official"   urlLink  gaybloggers.tribe.net    Chicago meeting since I've been a member there.  And the first since Andy moved to Chicago... should be a fun time!      •  I'm getting ready to go camping next weekend.  I still haven't recovered financially from the   urlLink  Montreal    trip... but I need another getaway.        •  I had a wonderful phone conversation with my friend Ellizzette yesterday.  She is always such a joy to talk to.  If you've read my old journals,   urlLink  you will find her in there   ... she used to live in Chicago but now lives in NYC.  Since she's been gone we probably have become even closer friends... although I miss seeing her in person.  Oh the memories I have of sitting up and watching TV (usually Frasier reruns) and eating pizza or hot cocoa.  Good good memories. :)  I need to go see her.  Very soon.      •  It's still only in the 50's here at night.  I fear that autumn has come early to Chicago.  Where have our summers gone?      •  I so do not want to go to work tomorrow... but oh well... bills must be paid.  Sigh.
