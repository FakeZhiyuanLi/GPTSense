       i can't sleep...quarrel wit azmi, just couldn't understand him..imagine frm sat, tdy morning he didn't call me but i called him..was infm that he'll be going out meeting his frenz..i don't mind at all, wat makes me blow up is tat he didn't even call me throughout the day..y must i be the one who call him always??? n so he call me later in the night like nothing happens!! which he didn't know that i'm still pisst off!!at one point when i raise my voice a bit to him & he got so angry tat makes him slam dwn the phone, tat makes me even more rebel..can't be bother to call him back. when he calls..told me i'm very inconsiderate, trying to show off my anger, rebelliousness, & even said tat now he's thinking how we could survive if later got married!! what does he mean by that?? just don't understand guys at times...(seriously....!!) i feel that i'm at not in the winning side, feel like telling him off wat i don't like but doesn't come in any help, for the past 2yrs ++ of our engagement, i still don't kknow, understand him tat well &amp; i PRESUME the same goes to him ( but he thinks, feel tat he know me well...)--life is so painful with men around but life can be bored without them too..(siignn!!)

       me just got back with my dad the other week..gather all my guts to meet him at his place at west coast, but sekali turns up to be a scene which i'm not prepared, it all started when his second wife talks to me abt my mum ( yah..dad remarry wit indo women), they were like against my mum, i just kept quiet through out the lecture, but at one point, i just coulnd't take it & cry out..i don't know why but...i was like thinking why must they feel this way &amp; the most disappointing is my sis..normalah, she was like all the way on my dad's side..come on who was the one who look after her all this while! how could she hv mind ot think abt her own mum to that extend..i don't know what to do abt this..i's geting ,married in abt 8 mths time, at first i was worried abt will my dad & his family come over to my big day..didn't mention it to my mum nor any one only to my grandmum..stories tata my dad told me abt mum &amp; nanny i can't bring myself to think in that way abt them..for me since 23 years of my life been living with my mum &amp; nanny, they r the most valueable person in my lifes...
