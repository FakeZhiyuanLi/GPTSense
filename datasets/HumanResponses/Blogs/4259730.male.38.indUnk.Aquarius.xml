       Freddie Anne, this weekend you were out of town. You and mommy went to Houston to see aunt Ellen. I got you back Sunday night. I just really noticed how happy you seemed. We played silly with each other tonight. You laughed and played. It was really cute. Your really growing up fast. We played a Spanish CD in the car on the way home. You love to learn and you make it fun for me to be involved in it with you. We watched a TV show about the making of the Hillary Duff concert tour. It was neat to see your reaction to it since we just experienced her concert the other night. You make my so happy to be around you, even if it just for an hour before you go to bed. Your such a gift from GOD.

      Well the day of the concert finally arrives. I picked up Freddie Anne from school and we went home and did homework. When I told her we were going to a salon to get her hair done, the smile she gave was the first of many on this day. After homework we went to Seventeen Salon and Spa. Freddie Anne got her hair crimped. She also got a few braids. She truly enjoyed people fussing over her. I made sure everyone knew we were headed to the Hillary Duff concert. After the hair she got her makeup done. She looked so cute and many people in the salon told her so.  Then we hit the road and had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe. We ate with Elvis looking over us the whole time. At Hard Rock there was a few tables of mom's and daughters who were also going to the concert.  When we turned the corner and saw the concert venue Freddie Anne was so excited to see all the people. We parked and walking among many young girls who were dressed up also. It was a mad house inside trying to buy t-shirts and other stuff. We had great seats. Haley Duff came out first. She sang some good songs, but nothing like Hillary. When Hillary came out I lifted Freddie Anne up in my arms and we sang the first song. The look on Freddie Anne's face when Hillary sang "let the rain come down" was amazing. She said " o this is my favorite song." On that song she was on my shoulders. We had a great time. I will never forget her words to me about how much fun she had. She showed me so much love and I smiled all night. I sang with her on four songs that I knew.  On the way home she called mommy and then fell asleep. What memories I will have.

       Well the first day of first grade went off without a hitch. O there was a minor crisis of the uniform shirt not fitting to good in the arms. A few tears later , Freddie Anne was all smiles as she entered her class. She was a little clingy to mommy but that is normal I think.       Walking in to school this morning it is so incredible to see all these parents moms and dads parking in the grass and walking there child in to the first day of school no matter what the grade. I wonder if it is that was at other schools. I know it is not. Tca is a special place. I know that there are many good schools but I see a lot of focus on the kids in a special way at tca. Freddie Anne is a special girl and I know God has a plan for her life and it is exciting to see her start on the journey of education and knowledge which will lead her to that plan. Check out her pic of the first day.

      Even though there is excitement about the first day of first grade. The event that comes on the after the second day of school is way cool. Hillary Duff in concert is the event. Freddie Anne and I will attend. I am looking so forward to it. We have great seats. I remember the Britney Spears concert that we went to two years ago. She had so much of a visual barrage of things to see that i know it had an impact on her . I look forward to what she has to say about this concert. I know she will know the words of the songs and i hope to get her dressed up so she looks the part of a concert goer. after all that is part of the fun. Hillary look out.  We want to be invited back stage.

      One of my favorite topics is my daughter. Freddie Anne Hodges. Wow what an amazing little girl. She is six. Starting first grade tomorrow. Makes me stop and reflect on her life and all that she has already experienced. Being born and then having her mom and dad split up before she was a few months old makes her unaware of the struggles that we had. She has always been accustomed to two houses and split time. Audrey and I are doing it right. The two of us never fight or use Freddie Anne as a pawn. That is one of the things I am most proud of.  thinking about Freddie Anne makes me happy. I am excited for her to grow and learn. She often shares with me what she knows by saying "daddy did you know..." I want her to be independent and make her own decisions in life. I never plan on seeing her as my possession. She is a human just like me. I am her dad and responsible for teaching her certain things in life.  Freddie Anne is so creative. She has a side of creativity to her that I hope she is able to develop. I have one that I have only been aware of in the past few Years.  First grade. tca. I am excited. Why am I so excited. I love the school she goes to. I love the way they develop the child. I know that she is learning a bunch. I see it weekly. I am excited about the people she and I will meet together. Will become our friends and be a part of our lives for years to come. I cherish the possibilities and the future that it holds.  raising her with out a wife. I relish it. I hope that my influence on her is so that she sees things the way I do and looks at life the way I do. The way I do now and not the way I did a few years ago. This is my first day at the clarkblog. thank you for reading.
