      todays topic: school and its bullshit; first the way our classes are set up: we have 2 semesters in a year, 2 quarters in a semester, so 4 quarters in a year.  we have 4 84 minute blocks everyday. for academic courses we have the same course every day for a whole semester, for electives the same course every other day for a semester, and for ap courses the same course every other day for both semesters.  now the story. today is the second day we have had a sub for spanish, and it is the last week before i final on monday.  our final is given by the whole department on what they think we should have learned, not what we did learn. our class is very far behind.  the final is supposed to be on ch1-5, and we are halfway thru ch3.  the other class is in ch7.  monday she told us what we were going to do this week, which is studying and preparing for the final in all my othe classes. but for sullivan it is trying to squeeze in all the verb tenses we should have learned.  she gave us a schedule of roughtly 1 tense a day, so by today we should have learned 3 tenses. but she has been absent both days and we are horribly screwed for the final. thats it for now  o yea its not all that bad, i have gotten to leave early both days.  maybe tomorrow she will be out too...

      yes i am addicted.  it is so compelling.  for all you players, the best pw is realms of myth and i can say the best dm i have played with is watcher.  his stories are so compelling that i keep coming back, although the server can be a little boring when no one else is on. but the game is great.  in the campaign i am on the ch2 of SoU, with a 9/2 fighter/weaponmaster.  i plan to mutliclass to 20/10/10 figher/weaponmaster/wizard.  at that point i will be unstoppable(trust me i've done it before)  watchers story on RoM about the curse of the wolf and roland and the mercenareis and bandits and druids is so in depth its hard to beleive it was created by one guy.. kudos to you d00d

      wow wat a fucked up movie. just finished it and.. wow.  i recommend this to everyone who likes movies that make you think and try to teach a lesson about society.  and edward norton is an outstanding actor, as is made very obvious by his performance.  other great performances by him: rounders, death to smoochy (although robin williams did amazing in death to smoochy also so it make edward norton look worse by comparison), fight club, and others too.  ye enuff of this.  another thing i watched today, for hte first time, 'righteous citizens brigade' it is hilarious!  i must commit myself to watching more episodes, along with trigger happy tv.   i guess since i just started this i should try to say about me, so i like only a few select shows: family guy, trigger happy, southpark, aqua teen hunger force, and curb your enthusiasm, and seinfeild while we are on the topic of larry david.  i quote these alot, so, get used to it.
