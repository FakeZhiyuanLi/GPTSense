      this day's fine..i'm back to school...i'm quite glad.at least i know i still have her....and i promise..she has me.  fourteen...very significant from now on.from now on,i'll look forward to every fourteen a month has......finally i'm settled with someone i REALLY LOVE.   i don't want the weekend to come..though i know i could have an opportunity to meet her. i am now sort of afraid to go home....it's no longer a home for me...i feel like everybody's eyes are on me.all that i say or do might be used against me. i am so afraid.  tomorrow's a thursday...i am still hesitating if i would go out and chill with my friends over alcohol. the thought of my mom catching me haunts me......i actually think i now have a phobia on my mom..or from everyone in connection with our house....i am like a prisoner who's just sneaked out of jail...so afraid,so worried,so uncertain,so much paranoid. i hate this.

      yup...it's only been a day since i met her......personally,that is. and i admit i've fallen for her...the problem is, i can't find a way to be with her...even just to talk to her......i am so down......  i am not allowed to have a "lovelife" anymore...add up the confiscation of my phone for that matter....fuck!!!!!!!  i miss her...i miss her so badly..............huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuuhuh.............  y does she have this special space in my heart??simply because we have a lot of things in common.plus, there's something in me which i want to share with her.....ahe told me she hasn't experienced that thing yet on her past thirty one relationships....and so i want to share that thing with her.It's nothing sexual, perverts!!!!!!!it's something sweet....*kulog*....haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i want her back!!!!!!!!!!!!!i want to start a new life with her!!!!!!!!
