       The Western Mail      PARENTS in Wales were today left in the dark as their English counterparts were warned not to sleep in the same bed as their babies during the first six months of life.  The Department of Health has produced updated advice warning of the risks of not only cot death but also accidental death for babies who bed-share with their parents.  But while a Department of Health (DoH) leaflet is freely available to all maternity units in England, a Welsh version has yet to be printed.  A spokeswoman for the National Assembly last night said a leaflet was in the pipeline but could not say when it would be published.  The DoH leaflet states, "The safest place for your baby to sleep is in a cot in your room for the first six months.  "While it's lovely to have your baby with you for a cuddle or a feed, it's safest to put your baby back in their cot before you go to sleep."  In contrast, the most recent Assembly-produced advice simply warns parents against sleeping with their babies if the parents smoke, have drunk alcohol, taken drugs or are extremely tired.  The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (FSID), which helped issue the new leaflet, last night said they believed the hold-up was due to the fact a bilingual version would have to be issued in Wales.  But Shadow Assembly health minister Rhodri Glyn Thomas said that was no excuse.  The Plaid Cymru AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said, "Given that this is very important information one would expect these guidelines to come out as soon as possible.  "Devolution should not mean we're getting this information later than they're getting it in England.  "It needs to be brought out quickly and I want to know why it hasn't been produced in Wales.  "Translation is often used as an excuse, but it is no excuse.  "There should have been sufficient forewarnings to make sure translation arrangements were put in place."  The FSID has highlighted several key risks in cot death, which is also known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Sids).  In terms of room sharing, the charity cites a study that shows babies who slept in a separate room from their parents were seven to 12 times more likely to die than babies who slept in the same room - but not in the same bed - as their parents.  The charity says it does not know why sleeping in a separate room from parents is more dangerous.  And with regard to the specific risk of bed-sharing, an FSID spokesman added, "The risk of death from sharing the same bed could be cot death, or accidental death due to overlaying (parent rolls over on baby and baby suffocates), or baby falling out of bed, or getting trapped between the wall and the bed, or getting tangled up in adult bedclothes."  The leaflet also said it was "especially risky" for babies to share a bed with parents who are smokers, even if they never smoke in bed.  And it includes existing advice for cutting the risk of cot death such as: placing babies on their back to sleep; cutting out smoking; and making sure the baby does not get too hot.  Cot death claims the lives of seven babies a week on average in the UK.  FSID director Joyce Epstein yesterday said, "The Welsh leaflet does say that babies should be kept in the parents' room for the first six months of life.  "We're quite content with that."

      Sleep is a mercy from the Lord of the World. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   "And have made the night as a covering"  [al-Naba’ 78:10]    i.e., as a covering for you. Hence the scholars agreed that sleeping at night is very important for physical health.   During the first years of life, a child sleeps approximately 22 hours a day, but he wakes up from time to time because he is hungry or sick or thirsty, or for some other need.   The hours of sleep are reduced until the child sleeps for 10 hours when he is six years old, and eight hours when he reaches his teens.   The child has to sleep for this number of hours so that he will grow up healthy and free from nervous tension.  Mistakes that we make:    Delaying the child’s sleep causes nervous tension, especially when he has to be woken up to go to school and he has not had enough sleep. This can lead to him not being able to focus in the classroon or even falling asleep in class.   Some families have a strict bedtime which is never changed for any reason whatsoever. The child has to sleep at eight o’clock no matter what the circumstances. This is a mistake because if the child is having fun playing, then he is forced to go to sleep, this is a kind of abuse and a lack of respect for his personality. If the child goes to sleep tense, this will be reflected in his sleep, and he will have nightmares and will not be relaxed in his sleep.   Some fathers wake their child up to play with him or because they have bought a new toy for him, especially when the father has been at work all day and this is the only opportunity he has. But this is a mistake, because you are interrupting your child’s sleep and it will be difficult for him to relax and go to back to sleep.   Some parents use scare tactics to make their children go to sleep. This is the worst mistake that parents can make.   Some mothers tell their children frightening stories which may scare them. This has negative effects on the child’s sleep, in the form of nightmares which disturb his sleep.   Some families encourage their children to drink liquids such as juice or water, etc., especially just before bedtime. This leads to the bedwetting which most families complain of.   Closing the door on the child when he goes to sleep and it is very dark cultivates a fear of the dark in the child; it also makes him restless and unable to sleep well.   Not making the child get used to sleeping alone from an early age. Some families allow the child to sleep with the parents or the mother until the age of six. This is a serious mistake, because it makes the child grow up dependent on others and restless.    Hence we advise parents to get their children used to sleeping alone from an early age, from the first year, so that they will be used to that.   Finally: we note that many of the problems which children are suffering from, such as bedwetting, fear of the dark, screaming in their sleep ("night terrors"), falling asleep in school, not being able to concentrate or not going to school at all… are all caused by disturbed sleep and restlessness.

      Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):     "O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods). And fear Allaah your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allaah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allaah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be that Allaah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce)"  [al-Talaaq 65:1]    "O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no ‘Iddah [prescribed period following divorce] have you to count in respect of them. So give them a present, and set them free (i.e. divorce) in a handsome manner"  [al-Ahzaab 33:49]    "And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allaah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.  The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allaah (e.g. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allaah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul‘ (divorce). These are the limits ordained by Allaah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers).   And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband…"   [al-Baqarah 2:228-230]    "And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death]. And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden"  [al-Talaaq 65:4]    "And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days"  [al-Baqarah 2:234]     From these aayahs we learn many rulings on divorce, reconciliation and ‘iddah (waiting period). First and foremost, Allaah urges men to keep their wives and to be patient with them, because there may be much good in that. This indicates that Allaah loves harmony between spouses and dislikes separation. These aayahs indicate that divorce is permissible, and that it is one of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon His slaves, for it wards off a great deal of harm and hardship when necessary.   At the same time, Allaah commands His slaves, if they want to divorce, to adhere to the limits of sharee’ah which are in their best interests, both spiritual and worldly, and to divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods). The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) interpreted this as meaning that they should be pure and not menstruating, and that no intercourse should have taken place during that period of purity. Thus the divorced woman will be in her ‘iddah and it will be known that divorce is permitted at that time. The same applies if she is divorced after pregnancy has become apparent. This indicates that divorce when a woman is menstruating or during a period of purity when intercourse has taken place but pregnancy is not apparent, is haraam. Also, it is not permitted for a man to divorce a woman more than once (at one time), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   "And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allaah as a jest"   [al-Baqarah 2:231]     Allaah does not mention any specific phrases by which divorce takes place. This indicates that everything which could be understood as meaning divorce, explicitly or implicitly, if the intentions or circumstances indicate that, means that divorce has taken place.    The aayah indicates that the divorce which is revocable is the first or second talaaq (divorce); if the husband divorces his wife for the third time, she is no longer permissible for him, unless she marries another husband, in a genuine marriage in which he has intercourse with her, then he divorces her and she waits out the ‘iddah following that divorce. The phrase "until she has married another husband" [al-Baqarah 2:230 – interpretation of the meaning] indicates that nikaah al-tahleel (a marriage of convenience to let a woman re-marry her former husband) is haraam, because it is not a shar’i marriage and does not have the effect of making the woman permissible for her former husband.    The phrase  "And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period" [al-Baqarah 2:228 – interpretation of the meaning]  indicates that the divorced woman whose divorce is revocable (first or second talaaq) is a wife who comes under the same rulings as other wives in all aspects, except that she does not have a share of her husband’s time [in the case of plural marriage]. The husband may take her back whether she likes it or not, because he has the right to do so, but Allaah has set out certain conditions for taking her back:    The divorce should be talaaq [not another kind of divorce]. If it is any kind of annulment, then he cannot take her back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  "And divorced women [al-mutallaqaat, i.e., women divorced by talaaq]…" [al-Baqarah 2:228]    It should be a first or second talaaq, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  "The divorce is twice" [al-Baqarah 2:229] , i.e., revocable divorce. Then Allaah clearly states that if the husband divorces her again, she is not permissible for him unless she marries another husband.   That it should take place within the ‘iddah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  "And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period" [al-Baqarah 2:228] .   That by taking her back, the husband should not have the intention of harming her; he should be meaning to bring her back to a real marriage.   Divorce (talaaq) should not be given in return for some compensation. If some compensation is given, then it is khul’ or something similar. Allaah calls khul’ a ransom; if the husband has the right to take the wife back, then there is no ransom in that case.   Divorce cannot take place before consummation, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  "O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no ‘Iddah [prescribed period following divorce] have you to count in respect of them" [al-Ahzaab 33:49] . This aayah indicates that divorce (talaaq) can only take place after the nikaah (marriage). If a man lays down a condition that if he marries a woman he will divorce her (immediately), this is not a real divorce. If a man divorces a woman to whom he is not married, this is not a real divorce.     This also indicates that if separation occurs before the marriage has been consummated, there is no ‘iddah in this case. After the marriage has been consummated, if the woman menstruates, her ‘iddah is three complete menstrual cycles after the divorce has taken place. The apparent meaning of the aayah is that this applies no matter how long or short her menstrual cycle is. If the woman is very young or does not have periods, or if she is post-menopausal, then her ‘iddah is three months. If she is pregnant, her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. If it is not clear whether she is pregnant or not, if she previously menstruated and has not yet reached menopause, then she should wait for nine months to be on the safe side as far as pregnancy is concerned, then she should wait out an ‘iddah of three months.   In the case of a woman whose husband dies, if she is pregnant, her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. If she is not pregnant,  it is four months and ten days, to be on the safe side in case she is pregnant.    The phrase  "there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves" [al-Baqarah 2:240 – interpretation of the meaning]  refers to the grief felt by the woman whose husband has died. So during the period of her ‘iddah, she puts aside anything that has to do with married life, such as beautiful clothes, jewellery, perfume, kohl, henna etc., as is narrated in detail in the Sunnah.   Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   "And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal or conceal it in yourself…"   [al-Baqarah 2:235].    The hinting to which Allaah attaches no blame is only in cases where a woman is irrevocably separated, whether by her husband’s death or a third talaaq or an annulment of the marriage. Clearly stating a marriage proposal is not permitted, but statements which may mean a marriage proposal or may mean something else are OK. But if a woman has been divorced by revocable talaaq, then it is not permissible to propose marriage to her, whether clearly or by hinting, because she still comes under the rulings of wives. This aayah also indicates that it is haraam to enter into a marriage contract with a woman who is still in her ‘iddah, because if it is haraam to propose to her, it is more so to draw up the marriage contract. If this takes place, the contract is invalid.   With regard to maintenance of the divorced woman during her ‘iddah, if it is a revocable divorce, then she is entitled to that, because Allaah described her as a wife and her husband has more right to her. She has the same rights of maintenance, clothing and accommodation as other wives.    In cases where a woman is irrevocably separated from her husband, if she is pregnant then she has the right to maintenance because of her pregnancy, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   "And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden" [al-Talaaq 65:6]    If she is not pregnant, it is not obligatory to give her maintenance and clothing.    Maintenance of a woman who is breastfeeding is obligatory on the father of the child. If the mother is still married to the father, then the maintenance of the wife includes the maintenance for breastfeeding, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    "but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis" [al-Baqarah 2:233]    He is not obliged to provide anything else, but if she is not married to him, he has to pay her for breastfeeding, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    "Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment" [al-Talaaq 65:6]   And Allaah commands that    "No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child" [al-Baqrah 2:233 – interpretation of the meaning].    This includes any kind of harm or unfair treatment.    The aayah (interpretation of the meaning),    "And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father)" [al-Baqarah 2:233]  indicates that that it is an obligation for the relative of the father, who has a right to inheritance from him, to provide for the mother if necessary. The latter condition is not affected by whether or not the relative will actually inherit from the father or not due to the rules of inheritance as affected by children, etc.; it is determined only by whether or not the relative is of a relation that can inherit.  If so, then they are obliged to provide for the mother, in the case the father himself cannot.   The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):    "then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul‘ (divorce)" [al-Baqarah 2:229]  includes permission for khul’ when there is the fear that the spouses will not adhere to the limits set by Allaah. It is permitted whether the amount of money involved is large or small. It is a ransom, and is not a kind of talaaq (divorce), and there is no possibility of going back to the husband (it is irrevocable).    The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):    "And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale)" [al-Baqarah 2:241]  includes all divorced women. Whoever divorces his wife (by talaaq) should maintain her as much as he can afford. This is the best kind of good treatment and noble good manners, because in such cases the woman is likely to be broken-hearted and usually has little wealth of her own. This is not obligatory except in cases where a man has divorced a woman before consummation of the marriage and has not given her the mahr.   Allaah commands the husband to either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis (cf. 2:231). This is so as to avoid any bad consequences and to keep peace between the two sides and so that the in-laws may remain on friendly terms. Thus life will remain stable, free from upsets. Is there any better than this ruling for a people  who believe?   The two aayahs (interpretation of the meanings):    "The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years’ [al-Baqarah 2:233]  and   "and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty months" [al-Ahqaaf 46:1]  indicate that the shortest possible period of pregnancy is six months, because if you take away two years from thirty months, you are left with six months of pregnancy.    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);    "Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  And if they decide upon divorce, then Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower" [al-Baqarah 2:226-227]   This aayah contains the ruling on al-‘Eelaa’, which is an oath sworn by the husband never to have intercourse with his wife again, or not to do so for a period that exceeds four months. If the wife demands her right to intercourse, and he refrains because of his vow, she should set him a time limit of four months. Then he should either have intercourse with her and offer expiation for his vow, or he should divorce her. It is understood  from the meaning of the aayah that if the husband refrains from doing his marital duty in bed, or intercourse, or (his duties of) maintaining, clothing, providing accommodation, etc., with no excuse for failing to do it, and his wife insists on this right, then she has the right to have the marriage annulled.    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning]:    "And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e. testifies four times) by Allaah that he is one of those who speak the truth.   And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the Curse of Allaah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her).   But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, if she bears witness four times by Allaah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie.   And the fifth (testimony) should be that the Wrath of Allaah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth   [al-Noor 24:6-9]     Allaah states that whoever accuses anyone else of zinaa is subject to the punishment for slander, which is eighty lashes, if he does not produce four witnesses. But He makes an exception in the case of the man who accuses his wife of zinaa and she denies it. In this case he has to bear testimony four times that he is telling the truth in what he is accusing her of, and when he bears testimony for the fifth time, he must invoke the curse of Allaah upon himself if he is lying. Then she responds by bearing testimony four times by Allaah that he is lying in his accusation against her, and when she bears testimony for the fifth time, she must invoke the wrath of Allaah upon herself if he is telling the truth. When this li’aan between them has been completed, he is no longer subject to the punishment for slander, and she is no longer subject to the punishment for zinaa or to detention. By virtue of this li’aan, any child involved does not belong to the husband, and the couple is forever separated.    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    "Indeed Allaah has heard the statement of her (Khawlah bint Tha‘labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad) concerning her husband (Aws bin As‑Saamit), and complains to Allaah. And Allaah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Seer.   Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by Zihaar (i.e., by saying to them "You are like my mother’s back,") they cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie. And verily, Allaah is Oft‑Pardoning, Oft‑Forgiving.   And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihaar and wish to free themselves from what they uttered, (the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave before they touch each other. That is an admonition to you (so that you may not repeat such an ill thing). And Allaah is All‑Aware of what you do.   And he who finds not (the money for freeing a slave) must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty Masaakeen (poor). That is in order that you may have perfect faith in Allaah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allaah. And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment."  [al-Mujaadilah 58:1-4]    Here Allaah mentions the ruling on al-zihaar, and states that it is evil and false speech. If the husband wants to resume having intercourse with his wife after forbidding it for himself in a clear statement or by saying that she is to him like the back of his mother, he has to free a believing slave before they can have intercourse again. If he cannot do that, then he has to fast for two consecutive months before they can have intercourse again. If he is not able to do that then he has to feed sixty poor persons.

      Allaah has enjoined marriage in a number of aayahs. He says (interpretation of the meanings):     "then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.  And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)."   [al-Nisaa’ 4:3-4]    "But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a Qintaar (of gold, i.e. a great amount as Mahr), take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin?  And how could you take it (back) while you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant?   [al-Nisaa’ 4:20-21]    "provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property" [al-Nisaa’ 4:24]     And Allaah tells us the story of how Moosa married the daughter of the man of Madyan (Midian) in return for working for him for eight or ten years.    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     "and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good" [al-Nisaa’ 4:19]    "but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them…" [ al-Baqarah 2:228]     These aayahs point to the command to marry, and indicate that it is waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged) according to circumstances. Allaah encourages men to choose a righteous wife, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):    "Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property)" [al-Nisaa’ 4:34]     The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Women may be married for four things: wealth, beauty, lineage or religious commitment. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper)."  That is because she will benefit her husband in both his spiritual and worldly affairs, and will protect herself and his wealth, and will take good care of the family and give the children a good religious upbringing.    It is permitted for a man to marry four free women, and he may have intimate relationships with as many as he wishes of slave women whom his right hand possesses. But it is recommended to limit oneself to only one wife if there is the fear of treating them unjustly.   Allaah has commanded men to give women their mahr, which may be a small or large amount, and may take the form of money/wealth or other benefits. A man who has an orphan girl under his guardianship is commanded not to treat her unjustly. If he wants to marry her, then he has to treat her fairly with regard to the mahr, and not give her less than she deserves. If he does not want to marry her, then he should not prevent her from marrying someone else so that she will be forced to give him something of her property or some of her mahr, for this is injustice and oppression (zulm). He has to work in her best interests just as he would do for his own daughters.   If a woman is mature and willingly gives her husband something of the mahr, then he has the right to consume it without any blame being attached to him, so long as that is not because he is keeping her hanging [not keeping her as a wife and not releasing her to marry someone else]. If he keeps her hanging in order to get back all or some of that which he gave to her, he is guilty of a grave sin. Allaah explained the reason behind that by asking how he could take that (the mahr) when he has enjoyed an intimate relationship with her and they have gone in unto each other, and "and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant" [al-Nisaa’ 4:21 – interpretation of the meaning]. This covenant means the obligations of marriage which include the fulfilment of all rights, the first of which is the mahr. The mahr is reduced by half if the husband divorces his wife before consummation of the marriage and the mahr has been agreed. She has the right to half of what has been agreed unless either of them gives up his or her half, which then belongs to the other. In these aayahs it is shown that the mahr is the property of the wife and that it should be paid in full when the marriage is consummated; the same applies if the husband dies, because that is a conclusion to the marriage.    Allaah has commanded both partners to live honourably with one another, treating one another kindly and refraining from harming one another. Neither of them should deny or withhold the rights of the other, or object to fulfilling those rights. Living honourably with one another means that maintenance, clothing, accommodation etc. should be provided according to ‘urf (local custom), if there is any dispute as to value and definition. It also depends on the husband’s own circumstances. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     "Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him." [al-Talaaq 65:7]    Allaah urges husbands to be patient with their wives even if they dislike them, because their nature may change, or He may grant children through them, or there may be many benefits in their living with them and having them take care of their property.    The phrase (interpretation of the meaning):  "and you have given one of them a Qintaar (of gold, i.e. a great amount as Mahr)" [al-Nisaa’ 4:20]  indicates that it is permissible to give a large mahr, but it is better to be simple in this and other matters, for the best of women are those whose demands are simple.    Allaah has forbidden seven kinds of relatives (for marriage): mothers, including every female in the direct line of ascent (i.e., mothers, grandmothers, etc); daughters, including every female in the direct line of descent (i.e., daughters, granddaughters, etc); sisters from all sides (i.e., including half-sisters through the father or mother); sisters’ daughters, no matter how far the line of descent; brothers’ daughters, no matter how far the line of descent; paternal aunts, i.e., every sister of your father or grandfathers; maternal aunts, i.e., every sister of your mother or grandmothers. Every other female relative is permissible for marriage, such as daughters of paternal uncles or aunts, or daughters of maternal uncles or aunts (first cousins). When there is a relationship through breastfeeding (radaa’), the corresponding relatives of the breastfeeding woman and her husband, to whom the milk belongs, are forbidden for marriage, just as is the case with blood relationships. As far as the nursing child is concerned, the prohibition applies only to him and his children [i.e., his siblings are not affected].    Allaah has forbidden marriage to four in-laws, three by virtue of the marriage contract itself [i.e., regardless of whether or not the marriage is consummated]. These are the mothers of your wives, the wives of your sons, the wives of your fathers. (The fourth category is) the daughters of your wives if you have consummated the marriage with their mothers; but if the marriage has not been consummated, there is no sin in marrying the wives’ daughters.    Allaah has forbidden being married to two sisters at the same time. The Sunnah forbids being married to a woman and her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time. It also forbids a free man to marry a slave woman unless he cannot afford to marry a free woman and he is afraid of hardship, and the slave woman is a Muslim.    It is forbidden for a Muslim man to marry a kaafir woman and stay married to her, except for chaste woman from among those who were given the Book, Jews and Christians. It is forbidden for a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir man. It is forbidden to marry a zaaniyah (woman who has committed fornication or adultery) until she repents, or to marry a woman whom one has divorced by talaaq three times, unless she has married another man in a genuine marriage, had intercourse with him and been divorced by him, and she has completed her ‘iddah.    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);     "and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers" [al-Ahzaab 33:50] .  This clearly indicates that the believers are not allowed  to marry except with a mahr that has been stated or agreed upon. If a condition is stipulated that there is to be no mahr, that condition is null and void. Is the marriage itself invalid because of that, or should a mahr like that of a woman of similar status be given, and the marriage remain valid? There are two scholarly views on this point. This also indicates that "quid-pro-quo" marriages are forbidden, where two men give one another their charges (daughters, sisters etc.) to one another in marriage, and the mahr of each woman is the giving of the other woman in marriage.     Allaah states that if a man marries a woman without agreeing upon a mahr, then he divorces her before consummating the marriage, then she should be given a gift – a rich man should give according to his means, and a poor man should give according to his means (cf. Al-Baqarah 2:236).     Giving a gift to a divorced wife in other cases is Sunnah mu’akkadah (confirmed Sunnah), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    "And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al‑Muttaqoon (the pious)" [al-Baqarah 2:241]    Allaah addresses women’s guardians with regard to their marriage in a number of places, for example (interpretation of the meanings):    "And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands" [al-Baqarah 2:232]     This indicates that the guardian has a say in the matter with regard to marriage.    The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  "and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant" [al-Nisaa’ 4:21]  indicates that there has to be the proposal and acceptance, because the firm and strong covenant includes the proposal of marriage and acceptance, which implies the inclusion of the rights of the wife, including the mahr, etc.    The aayah (interpretation of the meaning)  "if they mutually agree on reasonable basis" [al-Baqarah 2:232]  indicates that the mutual agreement of the two spouses should be taken into account, and that that mutual agreement should be on a reasonable basis. If a woman agrees to marry a man who is not compatible, then her guardian has the right to prevent her from marrying him.    If a wife is rebellious, Allaah commands the husband to advise her and to forsake her in bed [deny her her conjugal rights]. If she does not then come to her senses, then he may hit her (lightly). If there is the fear that there is a split between them and that reconciliation is difficult, then two arbitrators should be appointed, one from the husband’s family and one from the wife’s family, and they should try to reconcile them if at all possible, whether by giving some compensation or by foregoing some rights, or some other way. Otherwise, they may separate whether by khul’ or by asking for talaaq, depending on the circumstances.

      Anger is a condition in which the tongue works faster than the mind. You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying over the future.  Love ......and you shall be loved.   Allah always gives His best to those who leave the choice with Him.   All people smile in the same language.   Everyone needs to be loved ... especially when they do not deserve it.   The real measure of a man's wealth is what he has invested in eternity.   Everyone has beauty but not everyone sees it.   It's important for parents to live the same things they teach.   Alhamdullilah for what you have, TRUST Allah for what you need.   If you fill your heart with regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you have no today to be thankful for.   Man looks at outward appearance but Allah looks within.   The choice you make today will usually affect tomorrow.   Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears.   Love is strengthened by working through conflicts together.   The best thing parents can do for their children is to love each other.   Harsh words break no bones but they do break hearts.   To get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it.   We take for granted the things that we should be giving thanks for.   Love is the only thing that can be divided without being diminished..   Happiness is enhanced by others but does not depend upon others.   For every minute you are angry with someone, you lose 60 seconds of happiness that you can never get back.   Do what you can, for who you can, with what you have, and where you are.    The best gifts to give:   To your friend - loyalty;   To your enemy - forgiveness;   To your boss - service;   To a child - a good example;   To your parents - gratitude and devotion;   To your mate - love and faithfulness;   To all your brothers and sisters - love;   To Allah - your life

      Once, Prophet Mohammad (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W-sallam), said to Ali (razi-Allaho-anho):    Ali ! Do 5 Works Before Sleeping      Daily.Give 4000 Dinar Alms/sacrifice (sadqaa) daily before sleeping.    Read whole Qur'aan one time daily before sleeping.   Pay price of Jannah,daily before sleeping.   Make a truce/peace between two fighting men daily before sleeping.    Perform a Hajj daily before sleeping.    Then Ali (razi-Allaho-anho) requested Ya' RasoolAllah (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W-sallam) It is very hard to do how can I'll do all this?   Prophet Mohammad (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W'sallam) replied:     Read "Sura-e-Fatiha" 4 times..... Its equal to sacrifice 4000 dinars.   Read "Sura-e-Ikhlaas" 3 times.... Its equal to read Quran one time.   Read "Durood-e-Pak" 10 times..... Its equal to pay price of Jannah.   Read "Astagfaar" (Astagfaar =Astag firul'lahaa rabbi min kul'ly zanmbin w'atubu elaihe) 10 times..... Its equal to make truce/peace between 2 fighting men.   Read "4rth Kalima" 4 times..... Its equal to perform Hajj.    Who knew one could get this much blessings so easily?

      A young man was getting ready to graduate college. For many months he Had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.   As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation his father called him into his private study.   His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Holy Qur'an.   Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,  "With all your money you give me a Holy Qur'an?"  and stormed out of the house, leaving the Holy book. He never contacted his father again for a long long time.   Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father was very old, and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day.   Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things. When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's important papers and saw the still new Holy Qur'an, just as he had left it years ago.   With tears, he opened the Holy Qur'an and began to turn the pages. As he read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Holy Qur'an. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words  PAID IN FULL .   How many times do we miss ALLAH blessings because they are not packaged as we expected?  Just remember, when patience builds up we make it explode instead of looking at it in detail of why it is...

      Many Muslims show a great deal of piety by refraining from eating imported meats, especially tinned meat; they are very cautious about this matter for fear that it may have been slaughtered in a manner that goes against sharee’ah. This is a commendable effort, but there are other kinds of meat which are so subtle that even the pious do not detect them and the cautious do not spot them. The reason for that is that the meat which they want to avoid is visible and tangible, nothing is hidden from those who keep watch because the one who eats it will be seen doing so, whilst this is not the case with regard to the other, but both of them are described as eating. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   "Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?" [al-Hujuraat 49:12]   (referring to human flesh, i.e., gossip). Yes, this is what Allaah calls it: "Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?" There is a great deal of evidence to show that it is haraam, to point out how dangerous it is and to demonstrate the abhorrence of being caught indulging in this sin. It was narrated  that Ibn Mas’ood said:   "We were with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when a man got up and left. Immediately another man spoke disparagingly of him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: ‘Clean between your teeth.’ He asked, ‘Why do I need to clean between my teeth? I have not eaten any meat.’ He said, ‘You have eaten your brother’s flesh.’" (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani).     Note:   People are indulging in this sin, and there is no greater proof of that than the day-to day reality that we see. When one of those who feels protective jealousy with regard to the sacred limits of Allaah and does not want them to be violated, is denounced for this sin which may condemn them to Hell, he responds with the words that are on so many people’s lips:  "Don’t you want us to talk at all?" Subhaan Allaah, is their talk limited only to that which Allaah has forbidden to His slaves? Whoever thinks about this response will see the extent to which the Muslim community is split apart instead of supporting one another. It is as if we have not heard the words of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): "Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else let him keep silent." (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, hadeeth 6135)  This is the response to what they say: it is not good to commit this major sin, so keep silent if you have nothing good to say. Whoever keeps quiet will be saved.  Question:    You may ask me how come the righteous in particular fall into this sin despite the fact that they of all people should be furthest removed from it?   I say: there are reasons why they fall into this sin, which they share in common with the rest of the people. These include:      Being friendly and going along with one’s companions. He thinks that if he denounces them they will start to dislike him.   Wanting to get back to someone. The more angry one is with a person, the more he enjoys gossip about him.   Wanting to raise one’s own position by bringing others down and attacking their position.   Playing and joking; he may want to make others laugh by doing impressions of people.   Hasad (envy). If people are praising a man, he says, ‘There is such and such wrong with him, and I know him better than you do.’ He has no other way of getting at the person whom he envies apart from slandering and criticizing him.   Having too much free time and feeling bored, so that one can find nothing else to occupy one's time apart from mentioning people’s faults. This is because he is not using his time to worship Allaah. There are more obligatory duties than there is time to do them. The salaf used to say, "If you do not keep your nafs (self) busy, it will keep you busy."   Trying to go along with one’s boss or manager in finding fault with an employee whom he does not like, in order to gain favour with him.    Think about it:   You mix with innumerable people, including relatives and friends, teachers and neighbours. Beware lest tomorrow you see them standing with you before Allaah, and you see your friends and loved ones seeking redress for the slandering of their honour to which you subjected them.

      I was coming back from a long journey, and Allaah decreed that my seat in the airplane should be beside a group of carefree young men whose loud laughter and voices were too much, and the air was filled with clouds of smoke from their cigarettes. By the wisdom of Allaah, the plane was completely full and I could not change my seat.     I tried to escape from the problem by sleeping, but it was impossible… When I got fed up of their noise, I took out my Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan), and started to read what I could of the Qur’aan in a soft voice. Soon after that these young men started to quieten down. Some of them started to read newspapers, and some of them fell asleep.     Suddenly one of them said in a loud voice, even though he was sitting right next to me, "Enough! Enough!"     I thought that I had disturbed him because my voice was too loud, so I apologized to him and carried on reading in a whisper that only I could hear. I saw him holding his head in his hands, then fidgeting in his seat, moving a lot. Then he raised his head and said to me angrily, "Please, stop it, I can’t stand it!!"     Then he got up from his seat and went away for a while, then he came back, greeted me with salaams, and apologized. He fell silent, and I did not know what was going on. But after a while he turned to me with his eyes full of tears and said to me in a whisper, "For three years or more I have not put my forehead on the ground, and I have not read even one aayah!     For a whole month I have been on this trip, and there is no evil action that I did not indulge in. Then I saw you reading Qur’aan, and my world turned black and my heart was filled with despair. I felt as if someone was strangling me… I felt every aayah that you read coming down on my body like a whip .     I said to myself, for how long will this negligence go on? Where will this path lead you? What will happen after all this foolish play? Then I went to the washroom, do you know why?     I had the strong urge to weep, and I could not find anywhere else to hide from the people’s sight!"  I spoke to him in general terms about tawbah (repentance) and turning back to Allaah, then he fell silent.     When the plane landed, he stopped me, and it seemed that he wanted to keep away from his companions. He asked me, with a serious expression on his face, "Do you think that Allaah will accept my repentance?" I said, "If you are sincere and serious in your repentance, then Allaah will forgive all your sins."     He said, "But I have done terrible things, very terrible."     I said, "Have you not heard what Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   ‘Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’ [al-Zumar 39:53]?"      I saw him smiling with joy, with his eyes filled with tears, then he bade me farewell and left. Subhaan Allaah al-‘Azeem!   No matter how great a man's evil and sin, in his heart there is a seed of  goodness. If only we can reach it and make it grow, it will bear fruit, in sha Allaah.  This seed of goodness is always fighting in man's heart, even when it is covered by layers of whims and desires. When Allaah wills good for His slave, He causes the light of guidance to shine in his heart and guides him to the path of those who are guided. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    "And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky" [al-An’aam 6:125]       Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Swiyaan From al-Bayaan magazine, issue # 152, Rabee’ al-Aakhir 1421, pp. 66-67

       Medical News Today   If you are a coffee drinker you should consider having lots of little cups of coffee during the day rather than a few big ones if you want to stay awake and alert throughout the day, say experts.   According to scientists at Harvard University, USA, a large cup of coffee in the morning gives you an initial boost that soon wears off. They say lots of small coffees are better at keeping you alert.   You can read about their research in the journal Sleep.   Caffeine interferes with the systems that govern our sleep. Our sleep duration, and when to sleep, is regulated by the circadian system and the homeostatic system. The circadian system detects night from day, it promotes sleep rhythmically, it works with the release of melatonin and some other hormones (our body clock) in a cyclical fashion. The homeostatic system tells us how much sleep we need. In other words, the circadian system tells us when to sleep and the homeostatic system tells us how long to sleep.   The researchers studied 16 men. They stayed in private suites for a period of 29 days. They had no idea what the time was during the experiment.   They were made to live on a 43-hour day schedule. They had to stay awake for 28-hour stretches – the same period some doctors and soldiers have to. The aim was to disrupt their circadian system and enhance their homeostatic system.   Some of the men were given caffeine pills while others were given dummy pills. On waking up they had to take two pills, and then one every hour.   It was a double-blind trial. This means that neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who was taking the caffeine and who was taking the dummy pills.   They found that the men on the caffeine pills had fewer microsleeps (tiny naps) than the ones on the dummy pills.   The men on the dummy pills were unintentionally asleep for 1.57% of their ‘waking time’. The men on the caffeine pills were awake for 0.32% of their ‘waking time’. The ones on the caffeine pills performed better in cognitive tests.   On the other hand, the men on the caffeine pills felt sleepier than the ones on the dummy pills. This showed that although caffeine can keep you awake, it does not replace sleep – it just helps you stay awake while you build up a sleep debt.   The scientists said that it seems that caffeine blocks the receptors for adenosine. Adenosine is a key chemical messenger in the homeostatic system – in our desire for sleep.   Dr James Wyatt, lead author, said "I hate to say it, but most of the population is using caffeine the wrong way by drinking a few mugs of coffee or tea in the morning. This means that caffeine levels in the brain will be falling as the day goes on. Unfortunately, the physiological process they need to counteract is not a major player until the latter half of the day. While there is no perfect substitute for sleep, our results point the way toward a much better method for using caffeine in order to maintain optimal vigilance and attention, particularly when someone has to remain awake longer than the traditional 16-hour wake episode."   Experts say that a 20-minute-nap is much more effective than any amounts of caffeine.

       CBC News   TORONTO - The pervasive anti-obesity message may be partly to blame for young girls' obsession with weight and body image, according to new research on the prevalence of dieting among Canadian girls.   Researchers surveyed 2,279 girls in southern Ontario between the ages of 10 and 14. In Tuesday's issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, they reported girls as young as 10 are dieting to lose weight:      29.3 per cent of those surveyed said they were trying to lose weight.   10.5 per cent gave answers that indicated they were at risk of an eating disorder.   About 78.4 per cent of the girls fell within the recommended weight range for their height and age, with 14.4 per cent falling below.     INDEPTH: Obesity  Just over seven per cent of the girls in the study were overweight or obese. The national average suggests 35 to 40 per cent of kids are considered overweight, according to the Canadian Pediatric Society.   Previous studies into body image and unhealthy dieting tended to focus on girls over the age of 15.   Study author Gail McVey said she is concerned about the potential effect of well-meaning anti-obesity messages as well as media images of thin stars and models.  "If they hear messages about 'be careful about childhood obesity, you'd better lower your food intake or your fat intake' then is that not going to make children preoccupied with their weight and shape?" said McVey, a psychologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.   At an elementary school in Halifax, one group of friends has learned about the risks of extreme dieting.   "One of my friends, they were talking about going on a diet," said 12-year-old Bryanna Madden. "I told them, if they went too extreme, they could die."   McVey said the word "diet" shouldn't even come up for children, who she thinks are under more pressure to attain an ideal body shape today than in previous generations.   "I'm not certain that losing weight is the number 1 recommendation," said McVey. "Especially for children because they are growing and it's important for them to follow normal growth patterns."   As chief of pediatrics at North York General Hospital, Dr. Glenn Berall has seen childhood obesity rates skyrocket. Berall agreed eating disorders are a concern, but said obesity will have a greater health impact in the long run, such as an increased risk for heart disease.   "If you have a situation with medical risk factors, you can't just ignore that," said Berall. "The message is you need to be become healthier in your eating and your activity."   Both professionals agreed healthy living is the sensible approach for childhood obesity.

       CNN   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- A new approach being used to fight cancer may also help fight fat, U.S. researchers said Sunday.  They said blocking a certain protein seems to literally vacuum fat off mice.  When fat mice were injected with the new "fat-zapper" every day for a month, they all slimmed down to normal weight with no visible side-effects, the researchers reported in the June issue of Nature Medicine.  But they stressed the experiment is still in the very early stages and it affects a function found in virtually all cells -- meaning it has a high potential for serious side-effects.  "I am trying to un-hype this," said Dr. Wadih Arap of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, who led the research.  In cancer, a new class of drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors starve tumors by cutting off their blood supply.  Arap and colleagues have turned this approach against fat.  It makes sense, Arap argues -- fat cells grow and proliferate quickly just as cancer cells do. Like tumors, they build themselves a scaffold of tiny blood vessels called capillaries for sustenance.  Cancer drugs tackle different proteins involved in building blood vessels. Arap's team looked for a protein that might be found only in the blood vessels that feed fat cells.  They found one. Prohibitin is active on the surface of fat-feeding blood vessels. They also found a monoclonal antibody -- a synthetic immune system molecule -- that finds and attaches to prohibitin alone.  Reversing obesity "If even a fraction of what we found in mice relates to human biology, then we are cautiously optimistic that there may be a new way to think about reversing obesity," said Renata Pasqualini, Arap's research partner and wife.  Arap's team made the monoclonal antibody lethal by attaching it to another protein fragment or peptide that causes apoptosis -- a natural programmed cell suicide.  Then they put normal mice on what they called a "cafeteria diet". "It is high in calories," Arap said in a telephone interview. The mice started out weighing just under an ounce, 20 to 25 grams, but more than doubled their weight on the diet.  Then they injected half the mice with the new fat-killing molecule. After daily injections for a month, the fat mice lost, on average, 30 percent of their body weight.  "The weight loss was also accompanied by a reversal of fatty liver and glucose intolerance," Arap said, describing two common complications of obesity. "They actually looked better. You could see them walk and so on."  They also tested aging mice, which tend to get fat. "They responded just the same. They looked a little thinner," he said.  Arap said his team saw no side-effects. "They didn't have any signs of being ill," he said. "All measures look improved. If they had a side-effect we couldn't detect it."  Arap's team did not measure how long their mice lived and they did not measure lean body mass to see if the mice lost healthy muscle tissue, too.  Next they plan to test baboons, which tend to put on weight much as humans do.  Arap noted that other research in which fat rodents have miraculously lost weight has not translated to humans. And prohibitin is found inside cells, which means that accidentally disrupting it there could cause severe side-effects.  "I think it will be a while before we know whether this will be duplicated in humans," he said.

       New Scientist   Large-breasted, narrow-waisted women have the highest reproductive potential, according to a new study, suggesting western men's penchant for women with an hourglass shape may have some biological justification.  Women with a relatively low waist-to-hip ratio and large breasts had about 30 per cent higher levels of the female reproductive hormone estradiol than women with other combinations of body shapes, found Grazyna Jasienska, at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland and colleagues.  Two of the team, Peter Ellison and Susan Lipson at Harvard University in the US, have previously shown that higher levels of estradiol are indeed related to higher fertility in women trying to get pregnant.  "If there are 30 per cent higher levels, it means they are roughly three times more likely to get pregnant," Jasienska, a human biologist, told New Scientist.   "In Western societies, the cultural icon of Barbie as a symbol of female beauty seems to have some biological grounding," concludes the team. "I would be the last person to propagate Barbie," Jasienska notes wryly. "But when you think about the hourglass shape, Barbie is sort of the symbol."   Universal feature    The team studied 119 Polish women aged between 24 and 37, who were not taking any kind of hormonal contraception or medication. Women who were extremely underweight or overweight were not included.  Saliva samples taken from the women revealed that those with narrow waists and large breasts had on average 26 per cent higher levels of the hormone 17-b-estradiol, than women of other shapes. In the middle of their menstrual cycle, this peaked at 37 per cent higher levels than women in other groups.  Waist-to-hip ratio also had a strong effect on levels of another female hormone, progesterone. Jasienska, says that higher progesterone levels should also theoretically translate to increased fertility. However, large breast size was not significantly related to increased progesterone.  Jasienska says that a preference for low waist-to-hip ratios is a "universal feature" in psychological studies of men. "It was interesting to see what we observed in psychological studies has some biological background," she says.   Androgenous models    "The results are extremely intriguing," says Maryanne Fisher, a psychologist at York University in Toronto, Canada, whose study of Playboy centrefolds over 50 years revealed a drift in Western men's tastes.  She points out an ongoing debate over the relative importance of waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index (BMI) as features used by men to judge female attractiveness. She says women who have a "great" waist-to-hip ratio may not necessarily be attractive if they also have a high BMI.  Fisher's study of Playboy centerfolds showed that over 50 years men's preferences had moved from voluptuous to more androgenous models who had higher WHR but were thinner.  Jasienska notes that some non-Western societies do not use the same measurements of female attractiveness. In cultures which value large women, size may be a more important indicator of nutrition and health and therefore fertility, she says.

      I am going to talk about the surprising topic of Islamic "CULTS". Which claim either to have a false Prophet, have their own Prophet, or are far away from the boundaries of Islam.  We must remember that, Islam does not have sects or branches, but only evolves around the Qur'aan, and the Prophet Muhammed (SAW). You will be amazed of how far people go to discriminate Islam.    The Nation of "Islam"    noi[dot]org   Louis Gene Walcott Farrakhan is not a Muslim, nor is his doctrine Islam. Farrakhan is the leader of a black racist cult called "the Nation of Islam," (NOI) founded in Detroit, Michigan in the 1930's. While the group calls its followers Muslims, in reality, they have very little to do with the faith of Islam.  Islam believes in the total transcendance of almighty God (called in Arabic, Allah), the NOI teaches that black people are angelic gods. Islam maintains universal brotherhood, the NOI says that Islam is for blacks only. Islam teaches that prophethood ended with Muhammad ibn Abdullah, more than 1400 years ago. The NOI teaches that Farrakhan's teacher, Elijah Muhammad, is the last prophet. Islam teaches principles of spiritual and moral decorum such prayer, fasting, charity, pilgimage, etc., Elijah Muhammad cast these out or altered them beyond recognition.   [More Information on "NOI"]     Qadianiyyah/Ahmadiyya movement    This is a movement that started in 1900 CE as a plot by the British colonialists in the Indian subcontinent, with the aim of diverting Muslims away from their religion and from the obligation of jihaad in particular, so that they would not oppose colonialism in the name of Islam.  Their thought and beliefs:    Ghulam Ahmad began his activities as an Islamic daaÂiyah (caller to Islam) so that he could gather followers around him, then he claimed to be a mujaddid inspired by Allaah. Then he took a further step and claimed to be the Awaited Mahdi and the Promised Messiah. Then he claimed to be a Prophet and that his prophethood was higher than that of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).   The Qadianis believe that Allaah fasts, prays, sleeps, wakes up, writes, makes mistakes and has intercourse Â exalted be Allaah far above all that they say.   The Qadiani believes that his god is English because he speaks to him in English.   The Qadianis believe that Prophethood did not end with Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but that it is ongoing, and that Allaah sends a messenger when there is a need, and that Ghulam Ahmad is the best of all the Prophets.   They believe that Jibreel used to come down to Ghulam Ahmad and that he used to bring revelation to him, and that his inspirations are like the QurÂaan.   They say that there is no QurÂaan other than what the ÂPromised MessiahÂ (Ghulam Ahmad) brought, and no hadeeth except what is in accordance with his teachings, and no Prophet except under the leadership of Ghulam Ahmad.

       BBC News    A mother-to-be who eats fish during the later stages of pregnancy is less likely to have a very small baby, research suggests.    However, the University of Bristol team found no evidence a fish rich diet extends the length of pregnancy.   Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of health problems such as heart disease and diabetes.   The research, based on almost 12,000 women, is published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.   The researchers asked the women to record their fish consumption at 32 weeks of pregnancy.   From this, they calculated their intake of omega-3 fatty acids from fish. It is thought that these fatty acids have a beneficial effect on health.   On average, the women ate the equivalent of a third of a small can of tuna each day - equating to 0.15g of omega-3 fatty acids.   However, a diet rich in fish seemed to boost the foetal growth rate in pregnancy. The more fish the women ate, the lower were the rates of restricted foetal growth.   Although this association was not as strong when other influential factors - such as smoking - were taken into consideration, it was still significant.   Restricted foetal growth normally occurs in one in 10 pregnancies, but in women who ate no fish this increased to around one in eight (13%).   Blood flow   Lead researcher Dr Imogen Rogers said: "Being very small for dates at birth has been associated with increased risk of high blood pressure and other problems in late or middle age.   "This work adds to the evidence that fish is an important part of the human diet and reinforces the recommendation that pregnant women should include at least two servings of fish a week.   "Including oily fish is a good habit to encourage."   Dr Roberts said it was possible that omega-3 fatty acids helped to boost growth rates by making the blood less sticky and increasing its flow through the placenta, thus upping the amount of nutrition a baby receives from its mother.   The researchers point out that trials of fish oil supplements suggest that they lengthen pregnancy but do not boost foetal growth rate - the opposite of their research.   But supplements tend to contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than would be found in the normal diet.   The Food Standards Agency advises pregnant women and prospective mothers to avoid eating shark, marlin and swordfish because they contain relatively higher levels of mercury. They may also need to limit the amount of tuna they eat.   Fiona Ford, a research dietician at the Pregnancy and Nutrition Centre at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, told BBC News Online that there were concerns about just what effect pollutants were having on oily fish.   "My advice to pregnant women would be to eat a lot of flax seed, which also contains omega-3 fatty acids, and to eat oily fish once or twice a week," she said.   The centre runs a helpline on 0845 1303646.

       Ottawa Citizen    Obesity is now a global problem, spreading even to the developing world where it is contributing to new health threats. This is the first story in an occasional series on the subject by The Associated Press.   It’s a bitter truth to swallow: About every fourth person on Earth is too fat. Obesity is fast becoming one of the world’s leading reasons why people die.  In an astonishing testament to globalization, this outbreak of girth is occurring just as doctors are winning the fight against a number of vexing diseases.  Except in the poorest nations of Africa, new drugs and improved public health have corralled, if not cured, infectious diseases like smallpox, malaria and influenza that used to kill millions.  Now a new enemy is emerging in the 21st century - our appetite. Around the globe, about 1.7 billion people should lose weight, according to the International Obesity Task Force. Of those who are overweight, about 312 million are obese - at least 30 pounds over their top recommended weight.  Already, a third of all deaths globally are from ailments linked to weight, lack of exercise and smoking. And perhaps most worrisome is obesity’s spread beyond wealthy western nations.  From the glaciers of Iceland to the palm-fringed beaches of the Philippines, there are now more fat people in the world than hungry people. And in extreme cases, people who are heavy since childhood could die as much as five to 10 years early.  "What’s clear is that the developing world in particular is going to bear the enormous brunt of this weight gain," said Neville Rigby, policy director of the obesity task force.  "It’s rapidly accelerating. We’re even seeing obesity in adolescents in India now. It’s universal. It has become a fully global epidemic - indeed, a pandemic."  U.S. nutrition scientist Barry Popkin agrees. He serves as a key adviser to the World Health Organization, which will propose the first global strategy on diet, physical activity and health next week at its annual meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.  "When you find nary a country that’s being missed, nary a rural area that’s being missed, let alone an urban area," Popkin said, "you’ve got to say it’s more than an epidemic."  ---  No country immune  ---  Certainly the United States - home of the Whopper and the Super Big Gulp - remains a nation of scale-busters, with two of every three Americans overweight.  But there are a dozen places even worse:  South Pacific islands like Tonga, Kosrae and Nauru, where traditional meals of reef fish and taro are replaced by cheap instant noodles and deep-fried turkey tails.  Greece, birthplace of the Olympic Games, where the traditional Mediterranean diet is as much a relic as the Parthenon.  Oil-soaked Kuwait where Mercedes-driving mothers draped in black burqas feed french fries to their children while shopping for $375 giraffe-leather Italian loafers.  Soon China will be the world’s biggest country in more ways than sheer population, experts predict. It’s a stunning reversal from the Mao Zedong era when as many as 40 million people starved in the Great Leap Forward famine of 1958-61.  Pursuing a new doctrine of a "well-off society," Chinese cities represent the world’s biggest growth market for restaurants that until recently were considered to be counterrevolutionary. Now a new KFC, Pizza Hut or Taco Bell opens almost every day. Virtually every mainland home now has a television blaring junk food ads.  When university student Li Guangxu was a baby, rice was rationed. Now he eats cookies for breakfast.  Shopping at a CarreFour supermarket in western Shanghai, the solidly built young man fills a shopping cart with cookies, potato chips, soda and beer.  "I like these things. They taste great," Li said. "I don’t have time for anything else. Older folks don’t eat this stuff, but we do. We like snacks."  Most scientists believe our bodies have retained a prehistoric tendency to store fuel for periods of deprivation. Modern foods are so plentiful and so packed with calories that getting fat might be biologically difficult to avoid.  But the problem is rooted in something deeper than nutrition math. Pleasure and emotional comfort are basic instincts, and eating tends to stimulate those circuits in the brain, not unlike addictive drugs.  A food fix always is within arm’s reach.  Hardware emporiums host parking lot barbecues, and airports sell gooey, hot cinnamon rolls. You can buy potato chips whether you are trekking in Nepal or paddling a muddy river in the jungles of Borneo.  Who can resist? Almost no one.  "I compare the propensity to eat as somewhere between the propensity to breathe and the propensity to have sex," said Stephen Bloom, chief of metabolic medicine at the University of London’s Imperial College.  ---  Weight’s health effects  ---  Simply being fat won’t necessarily kill you outright. And it’s not weight alone that determines your risk from several diseases. But being overweight carries severe consequences.  Diabetes, heart disease and some cancers have been linked to weight, and all are on the rise.  Type 2 Diabetes is the illness most directly linked to obesity. A condition that often leads to heart disease and kidney failure, it is blamed for more than 3 million deaths a year. It afflicts 154 million people - nearly four times the number who have HIV or AIDS - and the WHO forecasts more than twice as many people will develop diabetes in the next 25 years.  Obesity can triple the risk of heart disease. One-third of all deaths globally - about 17 million - are blamed on heart disease, stroke and related cardiovascular problems, WHO figures show.  Some scientists predict it will outstrip infectious killers by the end of the decade.  Countries with extensive health care have stalled the onset of heart disease into old age and saved lives. But in much of the world, the latest drugs and arterial scouring procedures are not widely available.  In those countries, fatal heart attacks and strokes are much more common among younger, working age adults.  Researchers from Columbia University’s Earth Institute examined Brazil, China, India, South Africa and the Russian republic of Tartarstan. They found that the heart disease death rate for adults ages 30-59 was up to twice as high as the U.S. rate. Among Russians in the study, the rate was up to five times higher.  Obesity was cited as a primary factor, along with smoking, lack of exercise and untreated high blood pressure. The researchers described the influence of unhealthy diets as "surprising."  In South Africa, 11 percent of the population has HIV. Yet cardiovascular disease there still accounts for a higher rate of death among men and women under age 45.  In India, more than a quarter of the 5 million people who die from heart attacks and strokes every year are younger than 65.  Obesity also plays a significant, if poorly understood, role in many cancers. WHO data shows cancer accounts for about 12.5 percent of the world’s deaths, and that rate is expected to increase dramatically, mostly in developing countries.  The fact that obesity is on the rise in these countries as well is due to a confluence of factors that researchers say must be examined.  The global trend toward weight gain and its associated illnesses is not restricted to the well-off. High-fat, high-starch foods tend to be cheaper, so poor people eat more of them.  In Mexico, 40 percent of its 105 million people live in poverty. Yet two-thirds of men and women there are overweight or obese.  In the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 30 percent of the schoolchildren in 500 poor families have stunted growth due to poor diet. Yet, reports the Pan American Health Organization, about 6 percent of the children and 9 percent of the adults were obese, too.    In southern Africa, Zambia, which experienced a food crisis in 2002, reports that 10 percent to 15 percent of urban schoolchildren are obese.  "It’s a myth that you can’t have poverty and obesity coexisting," said Tufts University nutritionist Bea Rogers.  ---  How it happened  ---  Many factors contribute to the widening of the world’s waistline.  "For the last 150 years we’ve been getting fatter," said Bloom. But now, he says, "everything has kind of come together."  For starters, there is cheap, plentiful food. In developing countries, people still spend 40 percent of their income on food, as opposed to 15 percent by American families.  But even in poor nations, the relative cost of eating is declining as the world’s farmers are able to grow huge quantities of grain that is quickly processed and shipped without spoilage.  According to U.N. figures, the consumption of oils and fats over the last 30 years has doubled and is forecast to keep growing.  "In the developing world, it happened overnight," said WHO adviser Popkin, who heads nutrition epidemiology at the University of North Carolina. "One year they had very expensive butter and the next year edible oil came on the scene. It was a tenth of a cost and all of a sudden for very little money you could make your food taste better."  Nutritionists say more and cheaper sugar is another factor, despite the industry’s strenuous denials.  James E. Tillotson, director of Tufts University’s Food Policy Institute, calculates the average American drinks the equivalent of a 55-gallon drum of soda every year, compared to 20 gallons of sweetened beverages a year in 1970.  Increases almost as dramatic have occurred in Europe, and soft drink factories are increasingly popping up in developing countries.  Tillotson, who developed fruit-based drinks for Ocean Spray in the 1980s, says the beverage industry did not consider the health ramifications of their now-ubiquitous products: "We never thought people would abuse them."  Slowly, the food industry is responding.  McDonald’s has healthier menus and is phasing out super-sizing. Kraft Foods, whose products range from Oreos to Jell-O in 150 countries, has a scientific advisory panel. Among the company’s initiatives: capping the portion size of single-serving packaging.  Much of Big Food’s response comes after failed efforts by obese people to sue fast-food chains for damages.  "A lot of chief executives are really in a state of shock right now," said international nutrition expert Andrew Prentice of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "They’ve produced this stuff, cheaper and cheaper, feeding the world. All of a sudden, we’re saying, ’Stop doing this!"’  Another factor is how food is promoted and distributed. Brightly packaged brands that remain safe for months have widely replaced fresh bulk foods. In 1990, no more than 15 percent of food bought in Latin America came from supermarkets. Now, 60 percent is from six supermarket chains.  Experts say that because the changes occurred so rapidly and medical care is so lagging, the developing world’s obesity problem - combined with more cigarette smoking - could be both public health and economic disasters in countries that were verging on prosperity.  There are demographic changes, too. In many nations, women joining the work force created a demand for convenience foods.  "We already are tired from working and we buy only packaged foods," said Bertha Rodriguez of Mexico City. The 61-year old great-grandmother is a widow who supports herself by frying quesadillas in a streetside stand.  ---  Technology triumphs  ---  People spend more time sitting in the car, at the computer and especially in front of the television - an average of 1,669 hours a year in the United States, a habit that is extending internationally.  With such low activity levels, as little as 100 extra calories a day translates into 10 pounds in a year.  In China’s megacities, crowds once pedaled identical black bicycles to work. Now adults drive cars and ride trains and buses. In southeast Asia, farmers are replacing water buffalo plows with tiny tractors.  "It was done with the best of intentions," Bloom said. "Telephones, cars, computers all come from the freedom from hunger and fear. But it’s had a bad side effect."  Governments in some developing nations are taking steps.  Singapore schools have added physical activities and replaced soft drinks with bottled water. Brazil is making school lunch programs serve fruits and vegetables.  Such efforts are among those the World Health Organization says will be necessary to prevent a worldwide crisis.  But it’s a battle against human nature.  "It would be a huge public health achievement if we simply stopped the weight gain where it is now," said Stephen Blair, research director at the Cooper Institute of Aerobics Research in Dallas.  "I think that’s what we’re stuck with."

       BBC News    Children who regularly develop ear infections may have an increased risk of asthma, a study suggests.  Doctors in the United States examined the medical records of 7,538 children between the ages of two and 11.    They found that children with a history of multiple ear infections were twice as likely to develop asthma compared to those who had never had an infection.   Writing in the journal Chest, they called for more research to see if there really is a link.   As many as 150m people around the world have asthma and the numbers are rising fast. It causes 180,000 deaths each year.   Scientists do not know why so many people are developing the condition. However, a number of theories abound, one of which is that illness in childhood increases the risks.   This latest study suggests that there may be a link with ear infections.   Higher risk   Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago found that 72% of the children they looked at had suffered at least one ear infection. Overall, 9% had asthma.   They found that the risks of developing asthma increased with each infection.   Children with three or more infections were twice as likely to have asthma compared to those who had never had an infection.   "The prevalence of ear infections has increased significantly over the years, paralleling the rise in asthma rates," said Kamal Eldeirawi, one of those involved in the study.   "Our study confirms the association between the two conditions, showing that ear infections in early childhood may lead to asthma later in life," he said.   "It is possible that specific viruses or bacteria that cause recurrent ear infections may play a major role in the development of asthma.   "It is also possible that antibiotics that are commonly used to treat ear infections increase the risk of asthma, but more research is needed in this area."   Dr Richard Irwin, president of the American College of Chest Physicians, backed the call for more research.   "Determining the relationship between ear infections and asthma may help to identify or even anticipate health problems in children, while enabling physicians to provide more effective treatments for these conditions," he said.   Further research   Asthma UK's chief medical adviser Professor Martyn Partridge said much more research is needed.   "This is an interesting association but there is too little to suggest that one disease has caused the other.   "If the association is not by chance alone then there is a possibility that greater use of antibiotics is in some way associated with the subsequent asthma," he said.   "The other alternative is that infection of one or other type is associated with the onset of asthma and there have been previous studies suggesting an association between the bacteria mycoplasma pneumoniae and subsequent development of asthma.   "As the authors of this latest study say, further research is clearly needed."

       The Globe and Mail   Mother's milk may well be the best "drug" available for preventing heart disease.  New research suggests that babies who are breastfed are less likely to develop atherosclerosis (clogged arteries) as adults, and the lower risk may be due to breast milk permanently altering the way cholesterol is stored by the body.  "The findings suggest that infant nutrition permanently affects the lipoprotein profile later in life, and specifically that breast-milk feeding has a beneficial effect," said Atul Singhal from the Institute of Child Health in London.  The research, published in today's edition of the medical journal The Lancet, was conducted on 926 premature babies who, at birth, were assigned to get breast milk or formula.  Researchers tracked down 216 of the children when they had reached age 14 to 16 and tested their blood for several markers of heart disease: high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or good cholesterol), LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol), apolipoprotein B and A-1 (apoB and apoA-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP).  They found the breastfed children had markedly lower ratios of HDL to LDL and of apoB to apoA-1, both of which are measures of atherosclerosis risk. The children fed on mother's milk also had lower concentrations of CRP, another marker of atherosclerosis.  Dr. Singhal said the study is important because it is the first to prospectively look at the benefits of breastfeeding, with two groups of children assigned randomly to get breast milk or formula. All other research on the link between cardiovascular disease and breastfeeding was retrospective, asking people with heart disease whether they had been breastfed.  The researcher said the findings also bolster the growing body of evidence that the way infants are fed, and consequently the way they grow in the early stages of life, can have lasting impacts on their health.  Dr. Singhal said breastfeeding has been shown to reduce a person's risk of developing high blood pressure, obesity, insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes) and cardiovascular disease.  The biological mechanism is not entirely clear, but all these conditions are linked to a person's metabolism and, more specifically, to the body's inflammatory response.  One belief is that colostrum is the key. Colostrum is produced in the early days of breastfeeding, before true milk; it is low in fat, but rich in protein and in antibodies that protect a child from infection. Infections, because they cause an inflammatory response, seem to play a role in the development of a number of chronic conditions, such as asthma, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.  Another school of thought is related to the fact that breastfed children tend to grow more slowly and steadily in the early months of life, while formula-fed babies often have growth spurts. That is because mother's milk contains far fewer calories than formula.  Dr. Singhal said it appears that the "relative overnutrition" provided by formula feeding can alter the body's metabolism and lead to significant health risks in adult life.  About 70 per cent of women breastfeed their newborns, but that falls to less than 15 per cent by the baby's first birthday.  According to the World Health Organization, babies should breastfeed exclusively until the age of six months, and continue to be breastfed for at least two years for optimal health.

       Yahoo News   COPENHAGEN (AFP) - Women who undergo hormone treatment to counter the effects of menopause are two to three times more likely than others to get breast cancer, according to a study.   The Danish, study published on the Danish Institute of Cancer Epidemiology's website, which followed 23,618 women between 50 and 64 years of age for an average of five years, found that the 8,247 women who had undergone hormone treatment in connection with menopause were twice as likely as others to get breast cancer.   "There is not much doubt that women who take hormones run a much greater risk than others," the head of the study, doctor Anne Tjoenneland, told AFP.   Among the women not taking hormone treatment, 13 cases of breast cancer per 5,000 women were diagnosed annually, she said.   That compares to women undergoing light hormone treatment (taking the drugs only 21 out of 28 days), where 28 cases were diagnosed per 5,000 women, and to women who underwent continuous hormone treatment, where 38 cases were diagnosed each year per 5,000 women.   The Danish study, which is the most wide-ranging study on this subject ever carried out in the Scandinavian country, "confirms results from other studies carried out abroad that show that hormones, regardless of the brand, increase the risk of breast cancer," Tjoenneland said, adding that even the synthetic hormones used in Denmark, long thought to be safe, increase the risk of cancer.   Hormone treatment should be avoided in all cases, except when severe menopausal symptoms make them absolutely necessary, she said.   In such cases, she said the treatment "should be as short as possible."   "Women should ask themselves if the hot flashes and other inconveniences (linked to menopause) are so disabling that they can't stand them without taking hormones," she said.   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with 372,969 related deaths worldwide in 2000, according to estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

       The Boston Globe   Eating a healthy, balanced diet supplemented by a multivitamin may help ward off many ailments of old age, according to an accumulating body of research on homocysteine, an amino acid produced by the body.  Scientists have linked high levels of homocysteine to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, dementia and, just last week, to fractures due to osteoporosis. Studies show that people with the most homocysteine are about twice as likely to face these problems as those with the least.  For once, there appears to be a quick fix. Eating more foods containing folic acid, and vitamins B-6 and B-12 -- such as a diet rich in animal protein, whole grains, fruits and leafy vegetables -- reduces homocysteine accumulation.  Studies to test whether cutting homocysteine levels prevents disease are still underway, and it's not yet clear whether high homocysteine levels are the cause of disease or a byproduct. So, most doctors say it's not yet worth testing all patients' homocysteine levels, although those over 60 or with early signs of these diseases may want to ask their doctors about getting the blood test.  Many say the early research suggests, however, that it's worth getting the antidotes -- through meals or a daily multivitamin.  "Everybody should be getting the `treatment,' because it's cheap and nontoxic and has other health benefits," said Dr. Meir J. Stampfer, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. "If it's beneficial even slightly, then it's a good bargain."  Good lifestyle habits such as getting more exercise, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol intake, which are already linked to lowered risk of many diseases, also appear to help lower homocysteine levels, according to an analysis by Dr. Hus-Ko Kuo, a geriatric fellow at the Harvard Medical School Division on Aging and Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged. So far, the evidence for the impact of homocysteine is strongest in heart disease.  Numerous studies have found that high homocysteine levels are good predictors of future heart attacks, strokes and coronary-artery disease. Recently, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a substantial drop in death rates from heart attack and stroke -- 48,000 fewer per year -- that coincided with the addition of folic acid to most grains and cereals in 1998.  But two controlled studies in which multivitamins were added to the diet of patients with heart disease showed mixed results. Researchers reported a 38 percent reduction in the recurrence of blocked arteries in patients who had already had angioplasty and who took vitamins for a year. But they found no difference in the rate of second strokes among those who'd already had one stroke -- perhaps because the patients didn't lower their homocysteine levels early enough.  On Alzheimer's, researchers following volunteers in the long-running Framingham Study found that those with the highest levels of homocysteine had twice the risk of developing the crippling brain illness.  And last week, results from studies of the Framingham group and another in the Netherlands linked high homocysteine levels to a doubling or quadrupling of the risk of fractures in those with osteoporosis.  "With each association of this kind, the potential benefit of homocysteine lowering becomes greater and tips the balance in terms of doing something rather than waiting," said Dr. Irwin H. Rosenberg, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.  Scientists believe homocysteine is likely just one factor contributing to disease.  There is also preliminary research suggesting that high homocysteine levels may be linked to depression, deterioration in abilities such as balance and dexterity, and diminution of mental skills separate from Alzheimer's.  In the absence of any studies showing that lowering homocysteine directly prevents disease, scientists caution that is it still possible that the amino acid is just a bystander and something else is the culprit. Scientists are trying to remove the uncertainty with experiments currently underway, including giving folic acid and vitamins to people with early Alzheimer's to see if it helps slow the disease's progression. Such testing is difficult because there is no consensus on what level of homocysteine is harmful, or how early in life it should be lowered for optimal effect.  There's a sort of national experiment going on, as well, since the government required food manufacturers to add folic acid, also known as folate, to wheat flour in 1998 to help prevent birth defects. The presence of that folic acid has halved the number of people with high homocysteine levels in the Framingham Study, bringing it to about 10 percent.  But folic acid doesn't work alone on homocysteine, and with the current low-carbohydrate diet craze, many people may not even be getting enough folic acid in bread, pasta and other food made with flour. The body needs at least 400 micrograms of folic acid a day, as well as ample amounts of vitamins B-6 and B-12 to reduce homocysteine levels and for other bodily functions.  Homocysteine doesn't have any known purpose in the body, according to Rosenberg, but it is an important intermediary in hundreds of chemical reactions. The amino acid is made by the body and then metabolized into other substances with the help of folic acid and the B vitamins.  Scientists aren't sure how it might cause problems when it accumulates. But they believe that it damages blood vessels in the body and brain, which could cause heart disease as well as dementia. It may also be directly toxic to brain cells. In osteoporosis, scientists suggest it may weaken the connective tissue that forms the framework for bones.  For seniors, people who already have already suffering heart disease and those with a family histories history of heart trouble, some doctors are beginning to test homocysteine levels. Rosenberg would like to see more testing for this group to guide their intake of folic acid and vitamins, since he suggests some people may require more than they can get in their diet or even with a multivitamin. The test, typically not covered by insurance, involves drawing blood and can cost from $20 to $200. There is also a small risk in increasing folic acid, since it can mask a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which can cause nerve damage.  "The purists say you don't engage in treatment or public health interventions unless or until you've proven that those interventions have an impact," Rosenberg said. "The [American] Heart Association has taken that position. But we're not talking about transplants or expensive drugs. Why don't we make sure we have a lower homocysteine level, just like we say we're going to lower cholesterol."

       CTV.ca News Staff   Health Canada is moving ahead with plans to make the morning-after-pill available without a prescription, but it may still require consultation with a pharmacist before purchase.  By doing so, women would get more timely access to emergency contraceptives, Health Minister Pierre Pettigrew said in a statement.  "Making the drug available in pharmacies without a prescription will help women to prevent unwanted pregnancies," he said.  The morning-after-pill, also known as levonorgestrel, must be taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, to prevent a pregnancy. But it is not always available by prescription within that time period, especially with weekends and holidays.  Health Canada plans to amend the Food the Drug Regulations to remove the pill from a list of drugs needing a prescription, to a "Schedule II" status, which requires input from pharmacists at the point of sale.  Provincial and territorial pharmacy regulatory authorities will hold consultations after that to decide on the conditions of the sale. Such consultations are normal after proposed regulatory amendments.  "The fact that the drug would be available 'behind the counter' means that women would have timely access to the drug and receive professional health advice regarding its use," added Pettigrew.  The Canadian Women’s Health Network endorses making the morning-after-pill a non-prescription medication, but says getting women to talk to pharmacists first creates a barrier.  In a message on its website, the network says that as long as credible information is available about the pill at the point of sale, with pictures in a variety of languages, "there is no need for pharmacist intervention."  Several provinces allow for the sale of the morning-after-pill without a prescription, including British Columbia, Quebec and Saskatchewan.  The World Health Organization has deemed the morning-after-pill to be safe for use without prescription. At least 28 countries have listed it as such. That doesn't include the United States.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected making the morning-after-pill available over the counter, citing concerns about young teenagers' use of emergency contraception without a doctor's guidance.   The decision was made despite an earlier ruling in December by FDA's scientific panel, which voted 23-4 that providing the morning-after-pill without a prescription would be a safe and good way to prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Regardless, five states -- California, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico -- allow women to buy the pill from certain pharmacists without a prescription.  In the United Kingdom, a large grocery store chain by the name of Tesco plans to hand out the pills for free as part of an effort to reduce the number of teen pregnancies.  The morning-after-pill is a higher dose of normal contraception. It can cut a woman's chances of getting pregnant by up to 89 per cent. It has no effect if a woman is already pregnant.

       New Scientist   The steep rise in some cancers of the gullet in developed countries could be explained by the massive increase in the consumption of fizzy soft drinks, suggests a new study.  The volume of carbonated soft drinks downed in the US has increased nearly five-fold in the 50 years, while in the last 25 years rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma have rocketed by nearly six-fold in white males, the group with the highest soft drink consumption.  Mohandas Mallath, head of the digestive diseases department at Tata Memorial Hospital, India, and colleagues found a "very significant correlation" between the rise in consumption and esophageal cancer globally. The effects took about 20 years to come through, they believe.  The trend was seen in other countries where fizzy drinks have risen in popularity, such as the UK and Australia. But in countries where soft drinks have not caught on like Japan or China, there has been no increase in the cancers affecting the esophagus, the tube linking the mouth and stomach.  "The surprisingly strong correlation demonstrates the impact of diet patterns on health trends," says Mallath. "As the rates may continue to rise for another 20 years, we believe that more epidemiological studies are urgently required to establish the true association."   Plausible explanation    But both Mallath and nutrition expert, Lee Kaplan at Massachusetts General Hospital, say that the association cannot be taken as a causal link at this stage.  "This is only a correlation and doesn't in any way indicate causality," Kaplan told New Scientist. "There are a whole variety of things that occur in modern society. Refrigerators are associated with cancer - but they don't cause it."  However, previous studies suggest there is a plausible biological explanation to link soft drink consumption with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Mallath says that fizzy drinks can lead to gastric reflux which causes the gullet to become acidic for long periods. Gastric reflux is the most important risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, he says.  "If you drink a quarter of a litre of water, your stomach distends by a quarter of a litre," he explains. "But if it's a carbonated drink, your stomach may distend to maybe half a litre. This causes reflux - the acid of the stomach is thrown back into the food pipe."   Lowered pH    A Canadian study previously showed that drinking 350 millilitres, or just one can of soda, a day lowers the pH of the esophagus to less than four for 53 minutes. This would not cause a problem in itself, Mallath told New Scientist, but two cans a day over 40 years might   Kaplan notes that soft drink consumption might be a "marker" for a lifestyle or dietary choices that increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. For example, heavy consumption of fizzy drinks could lead to obesity, which is itself associated with reflux disease.  He also notes that some people with reflux develop Barrett's esophagus, which is a precursor to esophageal cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma. In contrast, the levels of squamous esophageal cancer have remained steady over the years.  Mallath and team analysed data from the US department of agriculture which showed that per capita consumption of fizzy drinks rose by more than 450 per cent, from 10.8 gallons in 1946 to 42.2 gallons in 2000. Esophageal adenocarcinoma rates rose by more than 570 per cent from 1974 to 2000 in white American males.  The results were presented at the Digestive Disease Week conference in New Orleans, US, on Monday.

       The Arizona Republic   New federal guidelines recommend checking children for possible heart and blood vessel damage if they have high blood pressure, a hazard increasing among the very young.  The new guidelines, like earlier ones issued eight years ago, urge doctors to begin checking children for high blood pressure at age 3 during routine office visits.   Bonita Falkner, who headed the National High Blood Pressure Education Program guidelines committee, said doctors have learned that even young children with high blood pressure can have resulting organ damage.   So patients should be routinely checked for conditions like heart enlargement and thickening of the carotid artery.  Even without signs of damage, doctors should work to help young patients get their blood pressure under control.   "The first step is lifestyle changes since the most common issue is that they are overweight," Falkner said.

       Forbes   NEW YORK - A new set of government-sponsored guidelines will highlight the need to keep a close watch on high blood pressure in children--and even, in some cases, to use anti-hypertension medicines to keep the problem in check.   The guidelines are being presented May 20 at the American Society of Hypertension's annual meeting in New York, and highlighted in an opinion piece by Dr. Julie Ingelfinger in the May 20 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Ingelfinger, a professor of medicine at Harvard, writes that the guidelines should "constitute a call to action."   The full guidelines will be published in the July issue of the medical journal Pediatrics. They indicate that between 1% and 3% of American children may have seriously high blood pressure. The problem is made worse by the fact that many of these children have other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity or high cholesterol. More than 15% of American children may be obese.   "We have enough evidence to show that hypertension really has its origins in childhood," says Dr. Bonita Falkner, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, who helped write the guidelines. "It's not just a disease that grandparents have."   The first guideline is that all children should have their blood pressure measured during checkups. That's not new. Sometimes, high blood pressure can be caused by other health problems, particularly kidney disease, says Falkner. These obviously need to be treated. But the guidelines put a new focus on treating high blood pressure in children, partly thanks to newly available information about drugs they might take. First, kids should be instructed to lose weight, exercise, limit the amount of salt in their diet and eat fresh fruits and vegetables. "For those who do not respond to lifestyle changes," says Falkner, "medication is appropriate."   But which drug? Until relatively recently, medicines such as Pfizer's (nyse: PFE - news - people ) Norvasc and Novartis' (nyse: NVS - news - people ) Diovan would not have been tested in children. That state of affairs was changed by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, which encourages drug makers to study their medicines in children. Investors mostly think of this incentive of as a way for firms to get a six-month extension on the patent life of a drug. But to doctors, it is very important. "Data is slowly coming out and it gives doctors some guidance," she says.   Still, that could mean some tough choices for doctors. John M. Flack, a professor of medicine at Wayne Sate University in Detroit, worries, for instance, that ACE inhibitors can cause problems in fetal development--a definite downside in teenage girls. Still, Flack says "The tide of obesity is going to mean a lot of hypertensive kids."   High blood pressure medicines already bring in $40 billion globally for drug giants such as Merck (nyse: MRK - news - people ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (nyse: BMY - news - people ), and Sanofi-Synthelabo (nyse: SNY - news - people ). In this high-stakes marketing war, drug companies are pushing their medicines to small sections of the population. Flack, for instance, is presenting data at the Society of Hypertension meeting regarding how a combination pill made by Novartis works better for African Americans with diabetes than a single-drug pill made by Merck. The study was funded by Novartis.   African Americans have long been identified as a high-risk population for hypertension. But children have not necessarily been seen that way--until now. The new guidelines may create one more new market for firms looking for ways to boost hypertension drug sales.

       BBC News     Citrus peel may not be very appetising - but research suggests it could be very good for you.     US scientists fattened up hamsters on a high-cholesterol diet, and then fed them compounds found in tangerine and orange peel.   They found the compounds signficantly lowered the animals' levels of LDL cholesterol - which is associated with heart disease.   The study is published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry.   The compounds, known as polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), are antioxidants that belong to a group of plant chemicals called flavonoids. Flavonoids exist in a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as tea and red wine.   A pilot study suggests that humans derive the same benefit from the peel compounds, and researchers are testing whether a supplement with combines PMFs with a form of vitamin E can reduce cholesterol levels.   Lead researcher Dr Elzbieta Kurowska, of the Canadian company KGK Synergize, said citrus juice contains only a small amount of the relevant PMFs as the compounds are not soluble in water. Peel, on the other hand, contains 20 times the level.   In addition, the peel-derived compounds are more concentrated and easily absorbed and metabolised by the body.   In the study hamsters were given the two PMFs most commonly found in citrus fruits - tangeretin and nobiletin.   A diet containing just 1% PMFs was enough to cut the animals' cholesterol by up to 40%.   Powerful effect   Other hamsters were given a diet enriched with two other flavonoids, hesperetin and naringenin.   This diet also lowered LDL cholesterol - but it took three times as much of the compounds to yield the same effect seen with the PMFs.   Dr Kurowska said it appears the compounds may work by lowering the secretion of cholesterol from the liver.   She said: "Our study has shown that super-flavonoids have the most potent cholesterol-lowering effect of any other citrus flavonoid.   "We believe that super-flavonoids have the potential to rival or even beat the cholesterol-lowering effect of some prescription drugs, without the risk of side effects."   The Department of Health announced earlier this month that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs - previously only available on prescription - were to be made available over-the-counter at pharmacists.   Sarah Schenker, a dietician from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: "It is not a big surprise that they have found something in plants that can have this effect - after all, cholesterol-reducing products such as Benecol contain extract of bark.   "But whether they are useful will depend on how strong their effect is. Statins are very strong drugs."   Previous research has also indicated that citrus juice can reduce the risk of cancer.   Judy O'Sullivan, a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "We will be interested to see if similar results emerge from long-term studies involving people.   "It is also important to stress that whatever the cholesterol-reducing potential of citrus peel, our advice remains the same: regular physical activity and eating a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in saturated fat are the best ways to avoid high cholesterol."

       BBC News     Half the population carry gene variations which increase the risk of birth defects such as spina bifida, research has found.     Scientists say the finding underlines the importance of women taking folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in their babies.   The research, by Irish and US teams, is based on analysis of 395 people born with neural tube defects.   It is published in the British Medical Journal.   Folic acid, when broken down in the body to folate, plays a key role in ensuring that the spinal column - or neural tube - develops normally during pregnancy.   Thus low levels of folate increase the risk that the neural tube will fail to close up properly - leading to spina bifida, or other related conditions.   Scientists already knew that one particular variant of the gene responsible for processing folate - the TT variant - is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects.   People who carry this form of the gene have lower levels of folate in their tissues. They also have higher levels of another compound called homocysteine which scientists suspect also plays a role in the formation of the nervous system.   The latest research has shown that another form of the gene - the CT variant - can lead to the same problem.   The analysis found that the CT variant was responsible for at least as many neural tube defects in the population as the TT variant.   This is because a much greater proportion of the general population (38%) are CT compared with 10% who are TT.   The researchers have calculated that combined the two variants account for 26% of neural tube defects in Ireland.   Dietary advice   Researcher Dr Peadar Kirke, of Dublin's Health Research Board, told BBC News Online: "This is a rare situation where there is a potential problem during pregnancy, but it can easily be corrected.   "I would advise any woman who is thinking of having a baby to ensure that she takes 400mg of folic acid a day for at least a month before she becomes pregnant."   Dr Kirke said the research also suggested that it would be a good idea to fortify flour products with folic acid - an idea which has so far failed to be adopted in any European country.   He said: "Forty countries around the world have either fortified flour products, or have plans to do so, but none of these are in Europe.   'Europe lagging behind'   "I feel very strongly that Europe is really lagging behind in a very serious negative way in not fortifying food."   Andrew Russell, chief executive of the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, said: "We are not doing enough to inform the public about the need to take folic acid, or to fortify the diet, and any evidence, such as this, that underlines the need to do that is very welcome."   Around one baby in 1,000 is born with a neural tube defect. Many are terminated during pregnancy.   It is estimated that taking folic acid supplements before pregnancy would prevent up to 80% of cases.   But while folate is known to be a key factor in the prevention of neural tube defects, others factors also probably play a role.   Mr Russell said: "It may be a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors."

       Forbes   WEDNESDAY, May 19 (HealthDayNews) -- If you are at risk for liver disease, drinking caffeinated coffee and soda may help protect you from getting it, a new study shows.  According to research presented at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in New Orleans, a researcher from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases found people at high risk for liver problems can reduce their risk by drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages.  There have been other studies that have shown this effect from caffeine, said lead researcher Dr. James E. Everhart. However, why caffeine protects against liver disease is not known.  "Caffeine blocks one receptor found in the brain and liver. This may have immunological effects, but this is really speculative," he added.  In their study, Everhart and his colleague, Dr. Constance E. Ruhl from Social and Scientific Systems in Silver Spring, Md., collected data on 5,944 men and women who were at high risk for liver injury.  The subject's risk came from excessive drinking, hepatitis B or C, iron overload, obesity or impaired sugar metabolism.  All the subjects participated in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  As part of the study, the subjects were asked to report how much coffee, tea and soft drinks they consumed.  Everhart and Ruhl found the more coffee and caffeine these people drank, the less likely they were to develop liver injury. This finding was the same for all age, gender and ethnic groups.  In addition, the protective effect was stronger for caffeine than for coffee.  Laboratory work is needed to figure out why caffeine has this effect, Everhart said. "More importantly, this finding should stimulate more clinical research in people with liver disease to see whether either drinking coffee or consuming caffeine has an effect," he added.  Dr. Jonathan A. Dranoff, an assistant professor of internal medicine at Yale University, said the finding is "provocative and worthy of further investigation."  Dranoff noted that findings in population-based studies do not necessarily confirm that caffeine causes any change in liver health. At this point, he said, "it is impossible to say that increasing coffee consumption would cause one to have less advanced liver injury."  The next step, Dranoff said, is to do a study of patients and randomize them into caffeine or no-caffeine groups. "This is the best way to test if this hypothesis is true," he added.  "These findings are so shocking that they deserve much more intense investigation before you can draw any conclusion," Dranoff said.

       Reuters   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A child's behavior during the preteen years may predict whether he or she will experience depression, violent behavior or social phobia as a young adult, new research findings suggest.  In a decade-long study, the researchers collected data for 765 children between the ages of 10 and 11 years old. At follow-up, they found that those who reported fighting, stealing or other conduct problems were almost four times as likely as their more well-behaved peers to have experienced depression or violent behavior by 21 years old.  "The good news is that the findings in this study suggest that parents, teachers, and service providers might be able to identify children with conduct problems at an early age and intervene to reduce those problems as a way to prevent later violence and depression," lead study author Dr. W. Alex Mason told Reuters Health.  Previous studies have also shown that children who show signs of anxiety and depression have a higher risk of depression and anxiety disorders in their later years. Other researchers have found that childhood emotional and behavioral problems precede antisocial and other behaviors in adulthood. In many cases, however, such study findings could not be generalized because the study group was referred from a clinic, for example, rather than from the community at large.  To address such limitations, Mason, of the University of Washington, and his colleagues conducted a long-term study of Seattle schoolchildren recruited from elementary schools in high-crime neighborhoods.  At follow-up, about 10 years later, 21 percent of the 21 year olds said they had committed at least two violent acts during the previous year. Twenty and 17 percent, respectively, said they had experienced depression or social phobia within the past year.  Overall, it was the children's own conduct reports that best predicted their later depression or violent behavior, the researchers report in the current issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  Also, the children's reports of shyness were associated with an increased risk of later social phobia. Parents' reports of their child's shyness or attention problems also predicted later social phobia.  Parental and teacher reports predicted later depression and violent behavior, in particular, but to a lesser degree than the children's self-reports, study findings indicate.  Yet, parents need not fear that their child's occasional scuffle or other conduct problem is a sign of his or her long-term risk for later violence or depression. "Some involvement in conduct problems is normal for many boys and girls," Mason said. It is only when those problems begin at a very early age or are somewhat severe that they may indeed increase a child's risk for later violence or depression, he explained.  The current study did not investigate why childhood conduct problems predicted later depression or violence, but Mason's co-author, Dr. J. David Hawkins, suggests a possible explanation.  "Some have hypothesized that children who engage in aggressive behavior like fighting, pushing others and other problem behaviors become increasingly socially isolated during adolescence," Hawkins said. "Their social failures may contribute to the development of depression."  SOURCE: Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, March 2004.

       Health Talk   A Doctor's necktie can be a source of dangerous bacteria which can be passed to patients, according to a new study conducted by researchers at New York' s Queens Medical center.  Researchers analyzed swabs taken from 42 neckties worn by physicians and medical staff as well as 10 neckties from security staff at the medical center. The swabs were cultured on laboratory plates and analyzed for the growth of microorganisms.  Of the 42 neckties belonging to the physicians and medical staff, 20 contained dangerous bacteria that can cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, blood infections and other illnesses.  In contrast, only one necktie from the control group which consisted of the 10 neckties belonging to security staff was found to contain pathogens.  The doctor's ties were found to be eight times more likely to harbor dangerous bacteria than those belonging to security staff.  The results of the study may influence a change to the standards of dress for physicians who work directly with the public.  The results of the study were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology on Monday.

       USA TDAY   CHICAGO (AP) — A study suggests some women might benefit from taking bone-boosting drugs earlier than many doctors recommend, because they can break bones well before they develop full-fledged osteoporosis.  The study involved 149,524 white postmenopausal women, age 65 on average, who had bone density scans. Of the 2,259 who broke bones during the following year, 82% had initial bone-density scores indicating thinning bones but not osteoporosis.   Only 18% of women with fractures had scores at or above the threshold many doctors use to define osteoporosis and to prescribe drugs.   The study was led by Dr. Ethel Siris at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and included researchers from Merck & Co., which makes the osteoporosis drug Fosamax and funded the study. A Merck doctor participated in a committee that oversaw the study design and analysis, Siris said.   Experts not involved in the study said the data appear sound.   The researchers suggested doctors consider lowering the threshold for prescribing osteoporosis drugs, especially for women who have certain risk factors that increase their chances of breaking a bone.   "My goal is not to sell medicine; my goal is to inform the debate," Siris said.   The research appears in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine.   Dr. Leonard Serebro of Ochsner Clinic Foundation cautioned that while drug treatment can help prevent fractures in women with full-blown disease, more evidence is needed to show the same benefit in women with milder bone loss.   An estimated 10 million Americans, mostly women, have osteoporosis, and some 34 million have low bone density and are at risk of developing the disease, too. Women's risk of developing osteoporosis increases as they enter menopause and lose the bone-protecting effects of estrogen.   The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends bone density screening for all women 65 and older and for younger postmenopausal women with at least one other osteoporosis risk factor, including smoking, low weight and family history of hip fracture. (Related site: NOF.org)  Many doctors fail to screen women. And when doctors do the tests, they often do not prescribe medicine unless the results indicate full-blown osteoporosis — a bone-density score of minus 2.5 or less, the researchers said.   They said a more reasonable approach would be using National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines recommending that medication be considered for women with scores of minus 2 or less; or minus 1.5 or less for those with at least one risk factor.   However, bone-building medication costs around $70 monthly and some insurers will not cover it if women do not have full-blown osteoporosis, Serebro said.

       Health Central    Their death rate is three times that of young women, new research finds.    (HealthDayNews) -- Want to know two of the biggest risk factors for an early death? How about being young and male.  That's the conclusion of a new study that found the risk of premature death is particularly high for males in the years surrounding sexual maturity, but it persists in later years as well.  "Being male is now the single largest demographic risk factor for early mortality in developed countries," said Daniel Kruger, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research.  He's co-leader of the study, which appears in the June issue of Evolutionary Psychology. He will also present the findings at the American Psychological Society annual meeting May 28 in Chicago.  The danger of being male rather than female is concentrated in the years between adolescence and adulthood, the study found. In those years, the death rate for men is nearly three times higher than for women.  But the difference exists years later. In the United States, the death rate for men up to the age of 50 is 60 percent higher than for women. Even at age 75, the male death rate is 46 percent higher. Overall, American men have higher mortality rates for 11 causes of death, ranging from heart disease to homicides to suicides, the study found.  "The magnitude of the sex difference is most starkly summarized by the numbers of deaths before age 50," Kruger said. "For every 10 premature female deaths, 16 men died prematurely."  Kruger and Dr. Randolph Nesse, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School, got their numbers from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the World Health Organization and the global Human Mortality Database. Data from 20 countries revealed the same pattern -- higher male mortality, with a peak difference at the age of sexual maturity.  The overall ratio of U.S. male-to-female mortality rates increased sharply at adolescence, peaking at 2.94 from ages 20 to 24 and slowly decreasing to 1.46 from ages 75 to 79, according to the study.  The highest male-female mortality ratio for a specific cause was 9.03 for suicide from ages 75 to 79, meaning nine men that age killed themselves for every woman who did. The next highest male-female mortality ratios were for homicide (5.72) and non-automobile accidents (4.91) from ages 20 to 24, the researchers found.  One reason for the difference is as old as time, Kruger said. Men --indeed, males of all species -- "compete for status and resources to attract attention and partnership of women," he said. "The higher degree of mating competition among males is the evolutionary reason why females live longer on average in most animal species."  "Not all men successfully get a partner," Kruger added. "Because of this, men are willing to take a higher degree of risk. Women's behavior is shaped by the needs of child care, so they have a decreased tendency for risk-taking."  Much could be done to reduce excess male mortality, Kruger said, mostly by persuading men to follow the rules of a healthy lifestyle -- proper diet, moderate drinking and exercise.  Some societal changes could also help eliminate the causes of early male death, Kruger said. But curiously, reducing the number of weapons in the hands of the American public probably wouldn't help, he said, because the male-female difference persists in countries where handguns aren't generally available.  The new report could also help, Kruger said. By bringing the mortality difference to public attention, "people would have a better idea of what is happening and might pay more attention to men's health issues," he said.  If male death rates could somehow be reduced to those of women, "one third of all male deaths under age 50 would be eliminated," Kruger said.

       News-Medical   The rate of childhood type 2 diabetes is 13 times as high among South Asian children as it is among white children, reveals the first UK survey of the disease in Archives of Disease in Childhood.  But overall national rates are still low, compared with countries such as Japan, where rates have soared over the past 30 years, the survey shows.  The findings are based on a survey of all 228 diabetic centres in 2000, carried out by the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinical Trials/Audit Group. http://www.bsped.org.uk/  Data were collected on children up to the age of 16 with a presumed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as a result of environmental factors, those with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)¯caused by defective genes¯and those with "atypical" type 1 diabetes.  Responses were received from 177 centres, which, between them, cared for over 15,000 children with diabetes.  Specialists reported 112 children to the survey, 25 of whom had type 2 diabetes and 20 of whom had MODY.  Children with type 2 diabetes tended to be older when diagnosed¯around the age of 13¯than children with type 1 disease. They were almost always female and overweight or obese. Most had a relative with the disease.  Rates of type 2 diabetes were more than 13 times as high among South Asian children as they were among white children.  Children with MODY were around the age of 11 when diagnosed, significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those with type 2 disease. And all of them were white.  Based on the figures and population estimates, the researchers calculated that the national rate of type 2 diabetes is 0.21 per 100,000 children. This is low, and much lower than a recent study from Birmingham suggested, indicating that there are large regional variations.  But they caution: "Our survey almost certainly underestimates type 2 diabetes, MODY, and secondary diabetes?"  It is well known that children with type 2 disease don't always have symptoms, and therefore do not come to the notice of doctors, say the authors. And they conclude: "All prevalence estimates based on diagnosed cases will be an underestimate." http://www.bma.org.uk

       BBC NEWS    Asthmatic women pregnant with a female baby suffer worse symptoms than those carrying a boy, research suggests.     The Australian researchers suggest the female foetus could produce a substance that could worsen their mother's asthma.   The research was presented to the American Thoracic Society conference in Orlando, Florida.   The conference also heard that pregnant women who eat oily fish may protect their babies from developing asthma.   Breathing problems   Scientists from the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, Australia followed 118 pregnant women with asthma.   Steroids control the inflammation of the airways that occurs in asthma.   It was found that almost two thirds of asthmatic women who were pregnant with a male foetus were symptom-free throughout their pregnancy.   However, while 61% of asthmatic women pregnant with a female foetus were symptom-free at 18 weeks, by 30 weeks only 28% had no symptoms.   Night-time symptoms increased significantly from 18 to 30 weeks in women pregnant with a female foetus. Those carrying boys had no night-time breathing problems.   Women with female foetuses also used inhaled steroids more as the pregnancy progressed. Use of medication did not change in those pregnant with boys.   Researchers say that the reason for the difference is unknown.   But they say it could be that the female foetus may produce a substance in response to the inflammation of the asthmatic mother's airways that somehow worsens the asthma.   A spokeswoman for Asthma UK told BBC News Online: "We know that in about one third of pregnancies, asthma symptoms can worsen.   "We don't yet understand the mechanisms involved but this study is one of many that have suggested an association between asthma and hormone levels.   "What is important is that pregnant women with asthma continue to control their symptoms effectively, and if symptoms do get worse they visit their GP."   Fish sticks   In a separate study, US researchers told the conference pregnant women who eat oily fish, such as salmon and trout, may help protect their children against developing asthma.   The team from University of Southern California, Los Angeles looked at five-year-olds studied as part of the Children's Health Study and interviewed their mothers about their pregnancy diet.   They found that the children of asthmatic women who ate fish such as salmon and trout during their pregnancy were, on average, 71% were less likely to develop asthma themselves than those whose mothers did not.   The more fish the women ate, the less likely her child was to develop asthma.   The finding follows earlier studies which showed eating oily fish could reduce a person's asthmatic symptoms.   But the California team found children whose mother ate fish fingers during pregnancy may be at increased risk of developing asthma.   They suggest this could be because fish fingers are deep-fried and contain omega-6 fatty acids, which encourage inflammation of the airways,   Professor Frank Gilliland, who led the research, said: "Oily fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which appear to be anti-inflammatory, and lead to the reduced potential for developing asthma and allergies."   He added; "A family history of asthma is a very strong risk factor for a child developing asthma.   "It appears that oily fish interacts with the genes involved in the predisposition to develop asthma, and somehow reduces the risk."   Asthma UK said there was increasing evidence that how a child's immune system developed in the womb was a key factor influencing whether or not they went on to develop asthma.   The spokeswoman said: "The mother's diet and the nutrients passed to the growing baby are likely to play an important role in this process .   "This study begins to tease out some of the dietary factors that may be important."   Dr John Harvey of the British Thoracic Society said: "We have known for some time that eating oily fish can bring health benefits such as protection from heart disease, arthritis, psoriasis and dementia as well as helping to protect adults from asthma."

       CNN    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Respiratory problems, including some asthma, can be caused by mold, but an extensive study released Tuesday failed to indict the fungus for a host of other, often major illnesses that some have sought to associate with it.    "Even though the available evidence does not link mold or other factors associated with building moisture to all the serious health problems that some attribute to them, excessive indoor dampness is a widespread problem that warrants action at the local, state and national levels," said Noreen Clark, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan.  Clark headed an Institute of Medicine panel that studied the health effects of mold, which has drawn increased attention in recent years with the shutdown of a major hotel, delayed openings of schools in several states and a raft of lawsuits.  The Institute, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said mold and building dampness do constitute a problem and urged it be corrected through a range of steps, including changes in how buildings are designed, constructed and maintained.  "An exhaustive review of the scientific literature made it clear to us that it can be very hard to tease apart the health effects of exposure to mold from all the other factors that may be influencing health in the typical indoor environment," said Clark.  "That said, we were able to find sufficient evidence that certain respiratory problems, including symptoms in asthmatics who are sensitive to mold, are associated with exposure to mold and damp conditions," she concluded.  Excessive dampness influences whether mold, as well as bacteria, dust mites and other such agents, are present and thrive indoors, the committee noted. In addition, the wetness may cause chemicals and particles to be released from building materials.  A rare ailment known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis also was associated with indoor mold exposure in susceptible people.  Preventing indoor dampness But the committee said it was unable to find evidence that mold is associated with fatigue, neuropsychiatric disorders or other health problems that some people have attributed to fungal infestations of buildings.  The little evidence that is available does not support an association, the committee said, but it added that because there are so few studies it cannot rule out a connection.  Molds that are capable of producing toxins do grow indoors, and toxic and inflammatory effects also can be caused by bacteria that flourish in damp conditions, the report noted.  The committee said information exists on how to control dampness but architects, engineers, building contractors, facility managers and maintenance staff do not always apply this knowledge.  The members called for development of guidelines for preventing indoor dampness and said they should be promoted nationally. In addition, building codes and regulations should be reviewed and modified as necessary to reduce moisture problems, the committee said.  Lawsuits claiming illnesses from mold in buildings that were not properly built or cleaned up have multiplied in recent years.  Changes in building codes in the 1970s to make homes more energy efficient and airtight had the effect of allowing less ventilation through a house that would dry out a wet wall or floor, which in turn may have led to more mold damage claims, according to attorneys involved in some cases.  The National Academy of Sciences is a private institution chartered by Congress to advise the government on scientific matters. The study was funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

       BBC News    People with grey hair could one day pop a pill if they want to restore their hair to its natural colour.    Scientists at French cosmetics giant L'Oreal have identified a pair of genes that may play a key role in turning hair grey.   They say these genes may determine how long many of the cells that give hair its natural colour live.   They believe that by targeting these genes they may be able to help these cells live longer, preventing grey hair.   Hair turns grey when the cells that give it its colour die.   However, the French scientists have found that some of these cells, which are called melanocytes, survive even when somebody's hair has turned grey.   "We discovered that the hair whitening process was linked to the progressive decrease in the absolute number of melanocytes," said lead researcher Dr Bruno Bernard.   "We believe that some of the genes we are studying right now might be involved or linked to this progressive decrease.   Possible treatments   Dr Bernard said while much more work is needed the findings could lead to new treatments.   "If we can block this progressive decrease, we could block the whitening process," he told BBC News Online.   "This is a big step forward in terms of identifying possible targets.   "We could be talking about a pill or we could be talking about a topical treatment."   Dr Bernard said full details of the work would be published in a scientific journal next month.   Desmond Tobin, a reader in cell biology at the University of Bradford who has carried out research in this area, said he would await the paper with interest.   "I will be interested to see what genes they are talking about. If it's true, it is quite a story," he told BBC News Online.   But he suggested that turning the discovery into a new treatment could prove challenging.   "We would need to find a long-lasting solution because hair grows in cycles. Restoring the pigment would not be a permanent thing."   The findings were released ahead of a new exhibition on hair at the Natural History Museum in London.   The exhibition, which runs until 26 September, explores the science of hair, showing how it can reveal a wealth of information about a person's diet, health and ethnicity.

       Reuters   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Smoking causes a range of diseases never before suspected, including cataracts, acute myeloid leukemia and cervical, kidney, pancreatic and stomach cancers, U.S. Surgeon-General Richard Carmona said on Thursday.   In fact, smoking affects virtually every organ of the body, Carmona said in the newest surgeon-general's report on smoking.   "We've known for decades that smoking is bad for your health, but this report shows that it's even worse," Dr. Carmona told a news conference.   "The toxins from cigarette smoke go everywhere the blood flows. I'm hoping this new information will help motivate people to quit smoking and convince young people not to start in the first place."   The report coincides with a study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that in 2002, 22.5 percent of U.S. adults described themselves as smokers, down slightly from 2001.   This rate of decline will not be enough to get the national smoking rate down to 12 percent, the goal set by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department for 2010, the CDC said.   Smoking kills an estimated 440,000 Americans a year, Carmona said. He said men who smoke cut their lives short by 13.2 years on average, and female smokers lose 14.5 years.   Smoking costs the country $157 billion each year -- $75 billion in direct medical costs and the rest in lost productivity.   The poor and less educated continue to be the biggest smokers, and more efforts need to be directed at these groups to encourage them to quit smoking, the CDC said.   ONE THIRD OF POOR SMOKE   Nearly 33 percent of adults living below the poverty level smoked, compared with 22 percent of those above the poverty level.   One-in-four men and one-in-five women said they were smokers. The CDC survey of 31,000 Americans found that 28.5 percent of those aged 18 to 24 years smoked but just 9.3 percent of those older than 65 did.  The CDC estimates that 45.8 million U.S. adults were smokers in 2002, and 41 percent said they had tried to quit at least once.   The CDC and Carmona said efforts need to be stepped up to help people kick the habit, including quitlines and assistance programs.   Carmona highlighted corporate programs such as one at Union-Pacific called "Butt Out and Breathe" that has reduced employee smoking rates from 40 percent in 1992 to 27 percent in 2003.   Some groups said the government needed to get much tougher on the tobacco industry.   "At the federal level, a good place to start would be the pending proposals in Congress to give authority to the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco just as it regulates other products," said American Heart Association chief executive officer M. Cass Wheeler.   States should raise tobacco taxes and ban all smoking in public places, Wheeler added.   The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids agreed but was pessimistic.   "The House (of Representatives) leadership is concocting another backroom deal to protect the tobacco industry while deliberately avoiding any action that would reduce the death toll from tobacco use," said Campaign president Matthew Myers.

       BBC NEWS    Regularly eating soya-rich foods cuts a woman's womb cancer risk, say experts.   A study of 1,700 women by the Shanghai Cancer Institute suggested the more soya they ate, the lower their chance of developing the cancer.   Soya contains isoflavones, plant-based chemicals that mimic the effects of oestrogen in the body, the research in the British Medical Journal says.   Having a diet rich in soya has previously been said to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.   It has also been suggested the chemical's oestrogen effects could be beneficial in fighting heart disease and cancer.   East-west divide   This latest research looked at 832 women from Shanghai aged 30 to 69 who had been diagnosed with womb, or endometrial, cancer between 1997 and 2001 and 846 healthy women of the same age group.   The researchers compared the women's soya food intake over five years, and took their measurements.   It was found that women with endometrial cancer ate less soya than healthy women.   The incidence of endometrial cancer in Asian countries is between a fifth and a third of that in Western countries.   The researchers say this could be because the consumption of soya-rich foods is significantly higher than in Western countries.   In this study, women's average intake of isoflavones from soya food was around 25 times that reported in Western countries.   Writing in the BMJ, the researchers, led by Professor Xiao Ou Shu, said: "Dietary factors may play an important role in this international variation.   But they said some of their findings, including an indication that overweight women benefited the most from eating a lot of soya, required further investigation.   'No evidence of harm'   Dr Tim Key, at the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit in Oxford, told BBC News Online said the research added to previous studies suggesting soya lowered endometrial cancer risk.   "The overall picture is that, for this cancer, the data appears to be reasonably consistent that there may be a reduction in risk.   "But there is not sufficient data to suggest there really is an effect.   "For breast cancer, the evidence is considerably less consistent."   He said he would not advise women to increase soya intake in their diet. "There is no evidence of harm, but the evidence of benefit is not conclusive."   Dr Key said the biggest risk factor for womb cancer was being obese.

       news.independent.co.uk   Children are at greater risk of cancers and fertility problems in later life because of the growing use of their cosmetics and toiletries, health experts are warning.  Adolescents and the parents of young children are buying more beauty products made for adults and toiletries such as baby wipes and bubble baths than ever before.  Fertility experts, cancer specialists and environmentalists are becoming alarmed by evidence that most of these products use potentially dangerous chemicals linked to breast cancer, falling sperm counts and hormonal damage.  The World Health Organisation and European health and environment ministers are to issue a stark warning next month. Ministers from all 25 EU member states, including the Evironment minister Alun Michael and Health minister Melanie Johnson from the UK, will sign a declaration calling for action to cut children's exposure to these chemicals.  Their warnings will be backed by initiatives by Friends of the Earth and the Women's Environmental Network.  A report by Friends of the Earth this week will accuse the UK's largest retailers of failing to take effective action to cut down on these chemicals in their products.  The ingredients of greatest concern include chemicals called parabens which can affect the hormone oestrogen and were recently found in breast cancer tissues. They are routinely used as preservatives in body lotions such Johnson's "baby softwash" and Kandoo toilet wipes.  Other suspect additives are known as phthalates, used to soften plastics and help carry scents in cosmetics. Banned for use in baby toys, they are linked to lower sperm levels in men, premature breast development and allergies.  Cosmetics companies such as Boots and Johnson & Johnson insisted all their products were very carefully formulated within strict health guidelines. But the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumes Association admitted it was likely to phase out the use of all phthalates because of consumer concerns.

       psychiatrysource.com   Food colorings and preservatives can increase hyperactive behavior in children, suggest the findings of a study that supports the removal of such additives from children's food, particularly among those with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  B Bateman (University of Southampton, UK) and colleagues sought to determine whether artificial food colorings and a preservative in the diet of 3-year-old children affected their behavior. They screened 1873 children for the presence of hyperactivity and carried out skin prick tests to identify atopy in 1246 of these children.   The children were given a diet that was free of artificial colorings and benzoate preservatives for 1 week. During the following 2 weeks, the children consumed a drink containing artificial colorings (20 mg/day) and sodium benzoate (45 mg/day) or a placebo mixture with no additives in addition to their diet for 1 week. They then switched to the alternative drink for the final week.   During the 1-week withdrawal phase, there was a significant reduction in levels of hyperactivity among the children. Parental reports showed significant increases in such behavior when children were given the drink containing additives, but such increases were not seen with the placebo drink.   The researchers note that the presence or absence of hyperactivity or of atopy did not influence the effect of additives on the children's behavior.   "These findings therefore suggest that significant changes in children's hyperactive behavior could be produced by the removal of artificial colorings and sodium benzoate from their diet," say Bateman and team in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.   "The potential long-term public health benefit that might arise is indicated by the follow-up studies that have shown that the young hyperactive child is at risk of continuing behavior difficulties, including the transition to conduct disorder and educational difficulties," they add.

       Forbes   TUESDAY, June 1 (HealthDayNews) -- For those who think the world is a bitter place, medical science offers this sweet health tidbit: Chocolate might be good for you.  Not just any chocolate, and always in moderation, said Mary Engler, a professor of physiological nursing at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Nursing. But her new study does find that biting into the right stuff can make arteries expand, increasing blood flow and thus reducing cardiovascular risk.  Milk chocolate won't do, Engler sressed, because it's, well, too milky. Look for darker chocolates, because darkness is an indicator of high levels of flavonoids, the chemicals that loosen up the arteries.  And this is one instance where good taste and good health go hand in hand, Engler said.  You can tell that a chocolate has a high flavonoid content because "the flavor is so intense and rich," she said.  The study that Engler and her colleagues are reporting in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition had 11 willing participants eat 1.6 ounces of flavonoid-rich chocolate every day for two weeks. Another 10 volunteers, sacrificing themselves for science, consumed an equal amount of low-flavonoid chocolate.  Ultrasound measurements showed that expansion of the arteries in response to greater blood flow increased by 10 percent in the flavonoid consumers, while there was a slight decrease in those who got the flavonoid-poor chocolate. Blood levels of a powerful flavonoid, epicatechin, rose more than eightfold for the high-flavonoid group and remained unchanged for the others.  The study was done in collaboration with the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Jeffrey Blumberg, chief of the center's Antioxidant Research Laboratory, said the work has expanded to look at other flavonoid-containing foods.  "Not only chocolate, but also tea, oat bran, almond skins and blueberries, all are good sources of flavonoids," Blumberg said. "We're trying to get a better understanding of vital chemicals, flavonoids being one of the larger groups."  Chocolate "happens to be a rich source of flavonoids," Blumberg said, but he added that "we are not trying to position chocolate as a health food."  In addition to flavonoids, chocolate also has a lot of calories and a lot of saturated fat, neither of which is good for the arteries, he said.  "But in the context of a reasonable diet, chocolate is not only a pleasurable food but might contain some health-promoting ingredients," Blumberg said.  Recommendations about chocolate can be compared with those about wine, Engler said. An occasional glass or two of wine has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, she said, "but people should not be overindulgent with wine. The same is true of dark chocolate in moderation as part of a well-balanced diet."

       CTV   You could be driving up your weight -- literally. According to a new study, the length of time spent driving translates into the size of the "spare tire" around your waist.  Even more than income, education, gender or ethnicity, the effect of time spent behind the wheel can be seen on the scale, says the study.  Based on a survey of 10,500 residents of Atlanta, Georgia, the study tracked participants' travel patterns over a two-year period, after measuring their height and weight.  Researchers found that for every 30 minutes added to their daily commute, drivers had a three per cent greater chance of being obese than those who drove less.  The quick solution is to move into town. The study found that people who live in walkable neighbourhoods lower their risk of obesity by 35 per cent.   The study, "Obesity Relationships with Community Design, Physical Activity and Time Spent in Cars," also concluded that people who live within walking distance of shops were seven per cent less likely to be obese than their counterparts who had to drive to get their groceries.  "The first day we went back and we looked at the diary, my husband and I, and I was shocked," said study participant Marnie Copeland.   The Vancouver-based researcher who led the study says the link is simple.  "The more driving you do means you're going to weigh more. The more walking means you're going to weigh less," University of British Columbia associate professor Lawrence Frank said.  "The average person spends just under an hour a day driving," he said.   Part of the problem lies in poor urban planning. Suburban developments offer bigger homes and backyards, but they often sacrifice sidewalks and park space. As well, there are few neighbourhood shops, with most suburbanites forced to drive to malls and big box stores to pick up their weekly supplies.   Although the study focused on Atlanta drivers, Frank warns that many North American cities share the characteristics that influence travel behaviour.  "Most regions look very similar to Atlanta -- anything that's built after World War II is pretty much auto-oriented," he said.  The phenomenon of urban sprawl, Frank warns, is manifesting in suburbanites' waistlines and will keep growing unless something is done.  "We need to start to look at the way we're designing our communities... the collective impact of having to drive everywhere is becoming really large."  To combat the problem, Frank advocates tripling the number of shops and services near homes; encouraging suburban development supported by public transportation; and leaving the car keys at home as much as possible.  The study, which will be previewed at an obesity conference in Virginia later this week, is expected to appear in a summer issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

       BBC NEWS    Women who repeatedly lose weight only to put it back on again could be damaging their immune systems, according to a study.    Doctors in the United States questioned 114 women who were overweight but were otherwise healthy.   They found that those who said they had a history of so-called "yo-yo" dieting had weaker immune systems.   Writing in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, they urged women against yo-yo dieting.   Killer cells   Doctors from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle took blood samples from each of the women who took part in the study.   They measured levels of their natural killer cells. These white blood cells are the backbone of the immune system, helping to kill viruses and protect against cancer.   The doctors found that women who had been the same weight over several years had higher levels of these cells. Those who had gone on yo-yo diets had much lower levels.   For instance, those who reported losing weight more than five times had about a third fewer natural killer cells.   The doctors said further research is needed to confirm these findings.   However, they said the study appeared to suggest that yo-yo dieting was bad for health.   "There's clear evidence that weight loss is beneficial for your health," said Cornelia Ulrich, a research assistant professor at the centre.   "What we're concerned about is this pattern of weight cycling where women go up and down."   She added that exercising to lose weight could be the answer, since it is known to boost the immune system.   The American Dietetic Association welcomed the study. Its spokeswoman Katherine Tallmadge urged people to avoid fad diets and to try to make long-lasting changes to the way they eat.   "Study after study shows that more moderate restrictions are more likely to last permanently," she said.   "That's why we registered dieticians are urging people not to do the fad diets and just try small changes that they're more likely to be able to live with - even if the weight loss is slower."   That view was backed by Nigel Denby of the British Dietetic Association.   "Sensible healthy eating combined with an increase in physical activity really is the perfect recipe for successful and more importantly maintainable weight loss," he told BBC News Online.

       Medical News Today   New British Heart Foundation statistics show death rates from heart disease are falling - but the issue of people being overweight and succumbing to obesity is posing a major threat.  A staggering 2.7 million people are estimated to be living with coronary heart disease in the UK – a number that is rising year on year.  Almost one in eight people - or 12% - have been diagnosed with a disease of the heart or circulatory system. In 1989 this was just 7%. And this figure does not include the millions who live with blocked arteries without even knowing it.  The statistics, published today by the British Heart Foundation at the start of Heart Week 2004, show more people than ever are living with CHD - but fewer people are dying from it.  The number of deaths is down from nearly 121,000 in 2001 to nearly 117,500 in 2002, continuing the decline seen since the late 1970s.   But with woeful trends in physical activity and widespread unhealthy diets, Britain now has the developed world's fastest growing rate of obesity.  The BHF statistics back up the House of Commons Health Committee's prediction last week that the UK's growing obesity epidemic is threatening to reverse the falling CHD mortality rate.  The new compendium of annual statistics has been launched in advance of the BHF's Big Red Fightback campaign for Heart Week - from 5-13 June.  It gives a comprehensive guide to the burden of CHD in the UK today, presenting the most up-to-date figures available for the numbers dying from and living with CHD, the treatment they receive and trends for the main risk factors.   Professor Sir Charles George, Medical Director of the BHF, said: “It is pleasing to see the death rate from CHD continuing to fall at a steady rate, but our aim should be higher than simply keeping people alive.   “Every year, thousands of us are being told that our coronary arteries are incapable of getting enough blood to our hearts and that, without surgery, our heart muscle could suffer irreparable damage.   "And those are the fortunate ones who get a warning. Why put ourselves through pain and misery so unnecessarily?   “Most heart disease is avoidable if we take simple measures to improve our lifestyle. Too many people in the UK are exercising too little, eating diets too high in fat, salt and sugar, and consequently, becoming overweight or obese.   "This trend has real and worrying implications for the future rates of CHD in the UK and for the freedom of future generations to live long and healthy lives.”   Death rates   Despite 30 years in decline, the UK death rate from CHD is still one of the highest in Western Europe – only Finland and Ireland have slightly higher rates.  That means a working age man is more than twice as likely to die from CHD in the UK than in Italy. The UK death rate is also higher than most other developed countries, including USA, Australia and Japan.   And it has not fallen as fast as some countries, such as Australia and Norway. However, countries in Eastern and Central Europe - most notably former USSR countries - have witnessed substantial increases in their CHD death rates.   In recent years, CHD death rates in the UK have been falling more slowly in younger age groups and fastest in the 55-64 year age group.   Between 1991 and 2001, there was a 40% fall in the death rate for men aged 35-44 and a 47% fall for men aged 55-64. For women, there was a 33% fall in the 35-44 age group, compared to a 53% fall in the 55-64 age group.   Obesity   The statistics show that the improvements made in the UK could be undermined by the obesity crisis. Physical inactivity and unhealthy diets remain a major problem. Only 37% of men and 25% of women take the recommended 30 minutes of moderate exercise at least five times a week. A worrying 88% of men and 83% of women consume too much saturated fat. And salt intake is excessive in 85% of men and 69% of women.   This all adds up to increasing levels of overweight and obesity – in ten years, the percentage of obese adults has increased by more than 50% - from 14% of the population to 22%.   This is the developed world's fastest growing rate of obesity - of all the countries where statistics are available, only Kuwait and Samoa top the UK rate. The increase is particularly marked in men, in whom obesity rates have tripled since the mid 1980s, with men now as likely to be obese as women.   And with around a quarter of children - 22% of boys and 28% of girls - overweight or obese, future levels of adult obesity are likely to continue to worsen.   Cardiac rehabilitation   With more people living with CHD, cardiac rehabilitation services need to improve. Only a third - 33% - of patients discharged after a heart attack or coronary surgery currently receive rehabilitation, as opposed to the 85% target set by the National Service Framework.   In a bid to help correct this problem, the BHF is setting up 40 community-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes across the country with £4.7 million from the New Opportunities Fund.   Through this scheme, patients who have suffered a heart attack or had heart surgery will be offered a tailored programme of innovative support to help them get back to full health.   Treatment   The good news is that treatment for heart disease continues to improve. The number of angioplasty and bypass operations has increased significantly in recent years.   The number of patients receiving life-saving clot-busting drugs within 30 minutes of hospital arrival has risen dramatically - from 59% in April 2002 to 81% in December 2003.   The number of cardiologists in the NHS is up nearly 50% in five years, from 467 in 1999 to 685 in 2004, and cardiothoracic surgeons up from 182 to 217. And prescriptions for drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases are up from 162 million in 2002 to nearly 180 million in 2003 – three and half times as many as 1983.   Professor Sir Charles George added: “For all the progress made, the sad fact is that one person every two minutes suffers a heart attack in the UK.   "That adds up to 270,000 heart attacks every year. That number looks likely to rise if we allow complacency and inactivity to ruin our lives.”   The full 2004 statistics report is available to order online by visiting bhf.org.uk/publications - or via phone by calling 01604 640016.

       Better Humans   Breast cancer has been linked to a common virus, suggesting that a vaccine could be developed to help prevent the disease.   While not proving a cause-and-effect relationship, the finding by researchers at Otago University in Dunedin, New Zealand and Melbourne University in Victoria, Australia suggests that infection by a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a risk factor.   "The most exciting possibility would be, if that were the case, maybe further down the track somebody could develop a vaccine," lead researcher Ann Richardson of Otago University said in an interview. "It could be given to young children and it would protect people against being exposed late in life because they already would have developed antibodies when they were young."   Viral connection  A link between breast cancer and CMV is supported by other links between cancer and viruses, such as that for cervical cancer.  CMV is a type of herpes virus that infects humans and can cause such symptoms as deafness.  Worldwide studies suggest that it may also be linked to breast cancer.   "Countries where most people are exposed to cytomegalovirus and other viruses in childhood have lower rates of breast cancer," says Richardson.  Adult infection risk  For their study, Richardson and colleagues examined blood samples from 377 women less than 40 years of age.   They found that women with breast cancer had on average 22% more antibodies to CMV than women without the disease.   This suggests that women infected with the virus in adulthood have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women exposed as children.  If true, it means that vaccines against CMV that are already in development could help prevent the disease.

       USA Today   Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe they have discovered a protein that controls whether mammals store fat or shed it. Biology professor Leonard Guarente found that when the protein — called Sirt1 — senses short-term famine, it turns off the receptors that keep fat stored in fat cells. When the protein turns those genes off, the body is prevented from storing fat, at least in the mice that were studied. The research by Guarente's team, paid for by the National Institutes of Health, is published in Wednesday's online edition of the journal Nature.  Near-starvation diets have been shown to extend life and prevent disease in many mammals. Whether it works in people is unclear, but lab findings on calorie restriction are fueling many studies of human longevity.  Researchers worldwide are looking for ways to chemically mimic starving without the inconvenience of actually missing meals. "It's easy to put rodents on a spartan diet. With people it's not so easy," Guarente says. "If we could make a drug that would bind to Sirt1 and fool the body into thinking that it needed to release that fat, then maybe people could get the benefits of calorie restriction without the side effects."   But even if such a drug were discovered, it turns out there's no such thing as a calorie-free lunch. Guarente suspects that to get the full benefits, vigorous exercise also would be required.

       New Scientist   An extensive survey of baby foods has found they contain worrying levels of disease-causing microbes. Of most concern was the presence of a bacterium called Enterobacter sakazakii, which has been linked to a handful of fatal outbreaks of meningitis at children's hospitals in the US and Europe.  The meningitis-causing bug has been found in powdered infant formula before, but this study is the first to detect it in dried infant food. Although there are only a few cases each year, the death rate from infection can be as high as one-third.   Premature babies and those with a weakened immune system are at particular risk. Even the babies who survive an infection often suffer brain damage, says Carol Iversen, who studies the bacterium at Nottingham Trent University in the UK. "Very few recover fully," she says.  A serious outbreak of meningitis at a neonatal intensive care unit in Tennessee in 2001 was traced to a batch of powdered infant formula. One baby died and eight others were infected. The incident prompted the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, to warn US doctors about the potential dangers of powdered formula. The manufacturer recalled the product.   Now Iversen and her colleagues have undertaken an extensive survey of powdered infant formula, dried infant food and milk powder from seven European countries, the US, South Korea and South Africa.    Stomach bugs    They analysed more than 200 samples from 110 different products for the presence of a variety of bacteria. Eight out of 82 powdered infant formula samples contained stomach bacteria, as did 12 out of 49 dried infant food samples.   Thirteen of the bacterial species they identified, including E. sakazakii, are members of the Enterobacteriaceae, a family associated with hospital-acquired infections.  Iversen stresses that manufacturers do not claim the products are completely free of pathogens, but she points out that many parents and nurses assume they are. "There is a misconception that infant formula powder is a sterile product," she says.  In a separate study, the team looked at the best ways to prepare and store infant formula made from powder to minimise the risk of infection. They found that the number of bacteria doubled every 10 hours in the fridge, while at room temperature it took just half an hour for numbers to double.   This means that any formula left out overnight could go from containing very few bacteria to harbouring dangerous levels, says Stephen Forsythe, who led the team. As a father himself, Forsythe sympathises with parents who want to prepare bottles ahead so that night feeds go as quickly as possible.   "At three o'clock in the morning an extra three minutes is a long time," he says. But Forsythe urges parents to resist the temptation to prepare formula in advance.  Both studies were presented at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in New Orleans last week.

       Medical News Today   The life expectancy of fruit flies increases an average of 50 percent when signals within cells of fat tissue are blocked or altered, new Brown University research shows. Published in the current issue of Nature, results of the study suggest that reduced levels of insulin in one tissue regulates insulin throughout the body to slow aging – a finding that brings science one step closer to cracking the longevity code.  PROVIDENCE, R.I. — When the chemical messages sent by an insulin-like hormone are reduced inside the fat cells of fruit fly, the fly’s lifespan increases significantly, according to new research conducted at Brown University.  A similar phenomenon has already been observed in worms, according to Brown biology professor Marc Tatar. But never before, Tatar says, has it been seen in fruit flies – whose 13,601 genes are shared in many ways by humans.  The experiment, detailed in the current issue of Nature, also sheds important light on the role insulin plays in the regulation of its own synthesis.   Block the hormone’s action inside a few specific cells, the study shows, and the entire body stays healthier longer. Scientists previously thought insulin triggered other hormones to achieve this effect, but Tatar and his team found that insulin regulates its own production and that it directly regulates tissue aging. The principle: Keep insulin levels low and cells are stronger, staving off infection and age-related diseases such as cancer, dementia and stroke.  “Think of the body like a car,” Tatar says. “We knew insulin controlled the car’s speed by regulating things like the gas pedal and the fuel injectors. Now we know that insulin is also the fuel that makes the engine go.”  To conduct the experiment, Tatar and four other Brown researchers created a line of genetically altered flies which had dFOXO – a protein controlled by the fly equivalent of insulin – inserted into the genetic material of fat cells near their brains.  Some flies were fed mifepristone, a chemical copy of progesterone. This hormone activated a switch attached to dFOXO, which in turn repressed the normal insulin signals inside the cells. As a surprising result, insulin production was lowered throughout the body. These flies lived an average of 50 days – 18 days longer than flies whose insulin signals went unchecked.   “We now know that insulin is a direct player in the aging process,” Tatar says. “So the research fits some key puzzle pieces together. And it should change the way we think about aging.”   Tatar’s research is part of a growing body of evidence linking low insulin levels to increased longevity. In recent years, scientists have found that mice and other animals live longer when they eat a low-calorie diet, which reduces insulin production.   “Aging regulation is a complex physiological process of nutritional inputs, metabolic regulation and hormone secretion,” Tatar says. “But we still have so many unanswered questions.”   Tatar and his team conducted their research over an 18-month period. The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the American Federation of Aging Research, the Ellison Medical Foundation and Pfizer Inc.

       Medical News Today   A simple measurement of the expression levels of two genes in breast cancer tissue appears to identify tumors that are more likely to recur in women treated with tamoxifen for early-stage disease. Determining patients for whom tamoxifen treatment is likely to fail would allow earlier use of other therapies that could be more effective for those women.  Researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center and Arcturus Bioscience, Inc., describe their findings in a report to be published in the June issue of Cancer Cell. The paper is being released online today (www.cancercell.org) because related material is being presented at the June 5-8 American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting.   The study was supported by grants from the Avon Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the National Cancer Institute.   Tamoxifen, which blocks the interaction between the hormone estrogen and its receptor protein, is used to treat breast cancers that express the estrogen receptor. However, only two thirds of these patients have a prolonged response to the drug.   "Until now, there has been no way to predict which estrogen-receptor-positive patients will not respond to tamoxifen treatment," says Dennis Sgroi, MD, director of Breast Pathology at MGH who led the hospital's research team. "Identifying those for whom tamoxifen is likely to fail could allow physicians to choose other drugs, for instance the aromatase inhibitors that more completely block estrogen's action." Sgroi is an associate professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.   The hormone estrogen can stimulate both the normal growth of breast tissue and the uncontrolled growth of breast cancer. Cells from most breast tumors contain estrogen receptor molecules, indicating that the tumor's growth is likely to be sensitive to the hormone's action.   Estrogen-blocking drugs have been used in recent years to prevent hormone-sensitive breast tumors from recurring after surgery and to treat metastasis. More than 500,000 U.S. women currently take tamoxifen, making it the most frequently used drug of this class.   The MGH and Arcturus research teams have collaborated for several years on studies of the molecular characteristics of breast tumors. Last year they published a study showing that advanced analysis technologies that identify which genes are expressed, or "turned on," in tumors can characterize the tumor's aggressiveness.   As a follow-up to that work, the research teams led by Sgroi and Mark Erlander, PhD, Arcturus chief scientific officer, began to investigate whether such molecular signatures could help identify which drugs would be the best options for particular patients.  The researchers gathered tumor samples from patients who had received tamoxifen treatment for early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. They identified 60 frozen samples suitable for gene expression analysis for which clinical follow-up information was available. Of those 60 patients, 32 had remained disease-free for an average of eight years, while 28 had recurrence of their tumor or metastasis.   Expression profile analysis demonstrated that the ratio between the expression levels of two genes – HOXB13 and IL17BR – was the strongest predictor of whether a tumor would recur. The higher the expression level of HOXB13 and the lower the expression of IL17BR, the greater the chance of tumor recurrence. Data from an additional 20 samples of tamoxifen-treated tumors supported the predictive power of the two-gene expression ratio.   "Many clinical laboratories currently have the capability to utilize Arcturus technology to measure the relative expression of these two genes," says Erlander. "Several centralized laboratories are developing a test that will be available this summer."   Because HOXB13 is known to be overexpressed in some breast tumors, the researchers investigated whether the gene might also play a role in tumor development. Using cells from normal breast tissues, they induced the expression of the HOXB13 gene. Cells in which the gene was activated showed obvious structural changes and appeared to have an increased ability to move and invade other tissues, characteristics of tumor cells.   While that result must be confirmed by future studies, it suggests that the pathway controlled by HOXB13 could be a new therapeutic target.

       REUTERS   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Prolonged exposure to high doses of vitamin C seems to make osteoarthritis worse, according to findings from a study involving guinea pigs. This suggests that people should not exceed the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C.  Previous short-term studies have indicated that vitamin C might be protective against osteoarthritis, but long-term treatment with vitamin C has not been studied, the researchers note in the medical journal Arthritis & Rheumatism.  Dr. Virginia B. Kraus from Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and colleagues investigated the effects of 8 months' exposure to low, medium, and high doses of vitamin C on the development of knee arthritis in guinea pigs.  The low dose was the equivalent of the amount needed to prevent scurvy, the medium dose represented that obtained by a person consuming five fruits and vegetables daily, and the high dose to match that shown in a previous study to slow the progression of arthritis in guinea pigs.  The guinea pigs exposed to the highest dose in the current study had more severe arthritis than the animals exposed to low or medium doses, the investigators report.  "This study highlights the potential drawbacks of long-term, high-dose vitamin C intake on joint health, suggesting that dietary intake should not be supplemented above the currently recommended dietary allowance (90 mg/day for men and 75 mg/day for women)," the authors note.  Kraus told Reuters Health that in addition to a balanced diet, one multivitamin per day is sufficient to achieve the recommended amount of vitamin C.  Besides the association with arthritis, long-term use of high dose vitamin C has been linked with diarrhea, iron problems, and kidney stones, Kraus added.

       KFOXTV.com   SAN FRANCISCO -- An activists' study found toxic dust on computer processors and monitors contains chemicals linked to reproductive and neurological disorders.   The study by a group of activists fighting chemical industries is among the first to find brominated flame retardants on the surfaces of common devices in homes and offices.   Independent researchers who reviewed the new study say consumers shouldn't throw out their computers -- but they should write to politicians and ask for stronger protection against such chemicals.  Researchers collected and tested samples of dust from dozens of computers in eight states, including university computer labs in New York, Michigan and Texas.  Dell and other computer makers continue using a flame retardant on circuit boards related to the brominated varieties. They also use lead, mercury and other toxins in central processing units and monitors. But Dell and others stopped using polybrominated diphenyl retardants in 2002.

       CBC NEWS   OTTAWA - Three boards of education in Ontario have been transferring pregnant teachers to different schools after outbreaks of an illness called fifth disease among schoolchildren.   In a precautionary measure, about 45 teachers have been transferred in the Ottawa region and 10 in the Peel area west of Toronto.   Fifth disease is a contagious viral infection also known as parvovirus b19 and slapped-cheek rash. Health Canada says it doesn't pose a serious threat to children.   However, first-time infections in pregnant women have been linked to miscarriages.   Dozens of schools in the Ottawa area have reported cases of the viral disease among their schoolchildren.   "I would say [there are] 60 schools this year that have reported outbreaks. So that is significantly higher than last year," said Paula Arnold, of the Ottawa Public Health Department.   "Generally speaking, we would move five to six teachers a year," said Julian Hanlon, deputy director of the Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board. "This year we've had to move 15 teachers."   The Peel school board has moved at least 10 pregnant teachers away from schools where the disease has been reported over the past six weeks.   And the Ottawa public board has re-assigned about 30 pregnant teachers so far this year.   By adulthood, between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of the general population is immune to the disease because of childhood exposure.

       Medical News Today   New research should help doctors decide which postmenopausal women are at an increased risk for a future fracture.   They say the crucial predictor of bone fracture in postmenopausal women without a previous fracture is bone mineral density. Bone mineral density is measured by a T-score. As the T-score decreases, the risk for fracture increases. The question has been what level of a T-score indicates an increased risk.   In a study, scientists examined different levels of T-scores and fracture incidence within one year of bone mineral density testing. According to the World Health Organization, a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis.   The study showed that of 2,259 women who had fractures, only 6.4 percent of the women had a T-score of -2.5 or less. If treatment is only given to women with a T-score of -2.5 or less, many women who had fractures will miss the opportunity for treatment. Researchers say in order to reduce osteoporotic fractures doctors cannot just rely on T-scores.   The second study focused on identifying women with osteopenia at potential risk for fracture within one year of bone mineral testing. Osteopenia is indicated by a T-score of -2.5 to -1.0.   The study looked at data on 57,421 women. Researchers looked at 32 risk factors for a fracture and it was found that the most important predictors of fracture included: women who had a previous fracture; a T-score at a peripheral site, such as the forearm, of -1.8 or less; self-rated poor health status and poor mobility.   The classification system developed by the researchers correctly identified 74 percent of women who suffered from a future fracture.   Researchers say they hope that the above guidelines will be useful for physicians in evaluating the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women.

       CNN International    CHICAGO, Illinois (Reuters) -- Preschool children who use a computer appear to develop better learning skills than peers who lack computer savvy, researchers said Monday.   In a study of 122 children aged 3 to 5, those exposed to a home or school computer either alone or with someone else three to four times a week scored higher on tests that gauge school readiness and cognitive development than non-users, said the study published in the journal Pediatrics.  Some earlier studies have found computer use improves children's fine motor skills and improves recognition of numbers and letters.  But other research has found no relationship between computer use and children's knowledge or language capability, and some experts believe computer use displaces essential childhood experiences such as playing with toys or with peers.  Researchers found no benefit to children having electronic or video games in the home. Of the 56 percent of children with computers at home, a majority had such games, wrote study authors Xiaoming Li, a pediatrician at Wayne State University in Detroit, and psychologist Melissa Atkins of Ohio State University in Columbus.  The authors said the study was limited, using parents' estimates of time spent on the computer and not assessing how often educational software was used. The study did adjust for the wealth and educational status of the children's families.  They said young children "use" a computer in a variety of ways: typing, playing games, using learning software, jiggling the mouse or joystick, watching images, or observing and imitating parents or siblings when they use the computer.

       ABC Science Online    Autism - A psychiatric disorder of childhood characterized by marked deficits in communication and social interaction, preoccupation with fantasy, language impairment, and abnormal behavior, such as repetitive acts and excessive attachment to certain objects. It is usually associated with intellectual impairment.   Women who have problems during pregnancy and labour are more likely to have children who develop autism, according to Australian research.  But the study has failed to pinpoint a single defining cause for autism, which is characterised by severely impaired social functioning and communication.  The research, led by Dr Emma Glasson from the University of Western Australia, was published in the latest issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry.  The study is the largest of its type to compare children with and without autism as well as the siblings of children with autism.  Study participants included 465 Western Australian children diagnosed with autism by 1999, 481 of their brothers and sisters, and a randomly selected control group of 1313 children without autism.  The researchers found that autistic children were more likely to have older mothers, be firstborn, and have a mother who experienced complications before, during and after birth.   The complications included threatened abortion, induced labour, epidural caudal anaesthesia, and emergency or elective caesarean. The women who had children that developed autism were also more likely to have labour that lasted less than an hour.  Babies who went on to develop autism were also more likely to have a lower Apgar score, an assessment of the physical condition of a newborn and an indication of foetal distress. The babies generally had Apgar score below six (out of a possible 10).  The researchers stressed that these factors can't be used as indicators that children will develop autism, a disorder diagnosed in children aged three to four years old, with the first symptoms appearing at about 12 months.  Siblings of children with autism were more likely than the control group to share these complications but did not go on to develop autism. Some of the control group also showed these same patterns, Glasson said.  "It's difficult to know why that would be," Glasson told ABC Science Online.  Genetic and environmental factors  Glasson said none of these factors alone could cause autism, and it was likely that both genetic and environmental factors together played a role in the development of autism.  Scientists have long thought that genetic factors might be involved in the development of autism as there was "clustering" of autistic children in family groups, Glasson said.  "There has been no breakthrough in the genetic research; it could involve dozens of genes. If siblings share genes maybe genes are a cause both of autism and the problems at birth."  But research has not yet found what was responsible for the disorder, which affects 10 to 20 per 10,000 in populations around the world.  This research represented "another piece in the puzzle", Glasson said.  The researchers used information from midwives' records, which contained details of the pregnancy, birth and neonatal period. But these records didn't include other information about whether the mothers were taking medication or supplements during pregnancy, she said.  "We would have liked to have that information."  In the last few years, research has found no evidence to back claims that MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines played a role in the development of autism.  Glasson said her research did not look at childhood immunisation as the midwives' records stopped just after birth.

       Health Talk   Women who drink soda pop or other sugary drinks on a daily basis increases their risk of developing diabetes, according to new research at the Harvard School of Public Health.  The findings of the study suggest women who drink one sugary soda drink a day have a 85 percent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to women who drink less.  Woman who drank diet soda pop that was artificially sweetened did not show any increased risk and tended to lose weight.  Researchers analyzed data from over 91,000 adult women over an eight year period. The data also indicated women who drank a sugary soda on a daily basis also gained about 10 pounds. Women who drank less by cutting down their consumption od soda pop gained an average of two to three pounds.   The study also suggests sugary soda pop consumption not only increases the risk of diabetes in women, it also contributes to obesity, due to the rapid rate sugar in soda pop is absorbed by the body.  The study was presented at the American Diabetes Association's 64th scientific sessions.   What is diabetes?  Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugars to build up in your blood.  Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.

       BBC News    The economic and social cost of mental illness in Northern Ireland is nearly £3bn a year, according to research.   It is more than the sum spent on the entire National Health Service in the province.   The figure is published in a report by the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health on Thursday.    Mental illness is calculated as being a 25% larger problem in Northern Ireland than it is in England.   Researchers have taken into account the cost to the health service, employers and the economy.   They have also added in a figure based on the human cost of mental illness.   Michael Parsonage of the Sainsbury Centre of Mental Health, which was involved in writing the report, said it was important to realise the scale of the problem.   "£2.8bn for the total costs of mental health problems in Northern Ireland is a very large figure, more than the total amount spent on health care in Northern Ireland, on all conditions," he said.   "The problem clearly could get worse. The scale is already very large and justifies some fairly major action to try to reduce that cost."   Graham Logan of the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health said the effects of the Troubles and social deprivation were partly to blame for the difference in the province and England.    "Our mental health needs are higher, the spend is lower. This document emphasises that if we were to be on a parity with England today, there needs to be an immediate cash injection of £60m.   "We are living with the legacy of the Troubles. There's the whole issue of socio-economic deprivation in Northern Ireland.   'Severe stress'   "There's a whole range of issues that need to be looked at."   He said workplace and family issues were the main causes of severe stress.   "There needs to be an holistic approach, there needs to be a strategic development of mental health promotion, mental health prevention and the importance of early intervention."   The report is called Counting the Cost and is to be submitted to the Department of Health.   A Department of Health spokesman said that spending on mental health care rose by 4.5% over the past two years.   Last year, an additional £8m was provided for mental health and learning disability services over and above inflation.   The spokesman said a review of mental health and learning disabilities was under way and that future funding would be determined on the basis of its findings.

       The Age   More stress may be the answer to preventing painful migraines, Melbourne research shows.   People who tried to shield themselves from migraine triggers actually made their symptoms worse, the Melbourne researchers said yesterday.   The findings defy traditional medical advice that migraine sufferers avoid certain triggers, including loud noises, flashing lights and stress.   Psychology professor Paul Martin, of RMIT University, said the research showed this was "very bad advice". The study exposed 300 patients, aged between 19 and 65, to varying levels of migraine triggers.  "We've found short-term exposure (to triggers) results in people becoming more sensitive and prolonged exposure makes them less sensitive," Professor Martin said. During the study, patients were given difficult word puzzles to solve, causing stress. "We found that if they were given short exposure to it, they become stressed and couldn't tolerate it at all," Professor Martin said. "But... if they did it (puzzles) for longer and at a continual rate, they become tolerant to it."  But "we don't want people to rush out and give themselves a migraine", Professor Martin said. "The implication of our work is... to build up their tolerance slowly in a controlled manner."

       BBC News    Some people may be genetically programmed to be unfaithful to their partner, a scientist has claimed.    Professor Tim Spector, of the Twin Research Unit at St Thomas' Hospital, London, says he has evidence of a genetic component to infidelity.   Focusing on women, he found that if one of a pair of twins had a history of infidelity, the chances her sister would also stray were about 55%.   In general it is estimated that just 23% of women are not faithful.   In addition, Professor Spector found the tendency for both twins to be either faithful or unfaithful was strongest in identical pairs - who have identical genes.   He stressed that genes alone did not determine whether somebody was likely to be unfaithful - much was down to social factors.   But he said it made good sense in evolutionary terms to get a good mix of genes - and for women to choose a better option if one came along.   No one gene   However, he stopped short of concluding that there was an infidelity gene.   He said: "There is unlikely to be a single gene for anything like this. But there are likely to be genes that participate in it, a number of genes working together; it might be things like risk taking or those associated with personality."   Dr Petra Boynton, a social psychologist, said it was very hard to know what element of behaviour was inherited, and what was learned.   "If as a child you see your mother cheat on your father, it comes easier for you. You copy the behaviour.   "It is not predisposed by genes, it's because you think that is what a relationship is like or that you can get away with it."

       BBC News    A breast cancer drug could save the lives of thousands of women living with the disease.    Research on women with early stage breast cancer found taking letrozole after a course of another drug, tamoxifen, cut death rates by 39%   Until now there have been no treatment options for women who finish their course of tamoxifen after five years.   The international study, of 5,200 women, included five hospitals in the UK.   The women finished their course of tamoxifen, and then took letrozole for an average of two-and-a-half years.   It is recommended that tamoxifen should not be taken for more than five years because its benefits begin to wane, and there is a risk of endometrial cancer, pulmonary embolism and stroke.   However, the risk of a recurrence of breast cancer remains.   Spread   The latest study, co-ordinated by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, also found that letrozole cut the risk of the cancer spreading to another part of the body by 40%.   Letrozole - known commercially as Femara - is an aromatase inhibitor. It works by blocking production of the sex hormone oestrogen, which is linked to the development of many breast tumours.   Professor Ian Smith, one of the investigators and head of the breast unit at the Royal Marsden NHS Trust, said: "This is an exciting development in improving overall survival of postmenopausal women with breast cancer.   "Femara is the first hormonal therapy to offer a post-tamoxifen option to reduce the risk of recurrence.   "We now know it may also offer women with node-positive early breast cancer an improvement in overall survival, nearly halving their residual risk of dying from this disease."   Worry   Samia al Qadhi, joint chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Care, said: "From our daily contact with women who have breast cancer, we know that they worry about recurrence of their breast cancer.   "The findings of this trial continue to give hope to the tens of thousands of women in the UK who are living with breast cancer, and potentially offer women an option of extended hormone treatment that may maximise their chances of survival."   Earlier this year another study, co-ordinated by Cancer Research UK, found that patients who switched from tamoxifen to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane halfway through treatment reduced the risk of the disease returning by a third.   The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice) is currently considering whether to make aromatase inhibitors widely available on the NHS for the treatment of early disease.   The results of the study were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in New Orleans.

       Reuters   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Nearly one quarter of children and teens with chronic headaches are overusing over-the-counter pain relievers, according to new study findings released Thursday.   Overuse of pain relievers was defined as taking more than three doses per week for over six weeks.   Most likely children and teens are taking this medicine because they think it will relieve their headaches, and not to get any type of "high," study author Dr. A. David Rothner of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio told Reuters Health.   "If you have (children), and you give them medicine when they have a headache, why shouldn't they think they can do it on their own," he said.   There are many reasons why kids shouldn't overuse these medicines, Rothner explained. Some pain relievers contain aspirin, which puts children under the age of 19 at risk of Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disorder, he said.   Other risks of overuse of over-the-counter pain medicines include kidney failure, liver problems, and intestinal and stomach bleeding, he said.   Finally, research suggests that overusing pain relievers may cause a once-occasional headache to turn into a daily one, Rothner said.   To investigate how often kids and teens with chronic headaches take over-the-counter pain medicines, Rothner and his co-author reviewed the medical records of 680 patients ages 6 through 18 who sought help for chronic headaches. As part of a routine medical exam, children noted how many times they took pain relievers.   Around 22 percent of participants overused pain relievers, the report indicates. Overuse occurred more commonly in girls who had a chronic tension-type headache, or a mix of tension-type and migraine headaches.   Approximately one in seven kids said they took the medicines without telling their parents. Almost one in five participants said they had headaches every day, or nearly so. Most of the daily headache sufferers were girls and students who got high grades in school.   To keep kids safe from overuse of pain relievers, Rothner recommends that parents of chronic headache sufferers monitor what they take to relieve the pain.   "If you see they're using the medicine more than twice a week, then bingo! You've got a problem on your hands, and you've got to do something about it," he said.   The researchers presented their findings this week at the 46th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Headache Society in Vancouver.

       BBC News   Scientists found evidence that women are subconsciously driven to have more sex during the most fertile time of their monthly cycle.   An analysis by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found intercourse was 24% more frequent on fertile days.   The study is published in the journal Human Reproduction.   The study focused on women who had either been sterilised or were using an intrauterine device (IUD).   The frequency of intercourse increased during the six most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and peaked at ovulation - despite the fact that these women clearly did not want a baby.   Biological factors   Lead research Professor Allen Wilcox said: "There apparently are biological factors promoting intercourse during a woman's six fertile days, whether she wants a baby or not.   "It suggests that couples who 'take a chance' with unprotected intercourse have the deck stacked against them.   "Intercourse apparently does not happen randomly. It's more likely to occur on the fertile days, even though the average woman won't know when these days are."   It was already known that in many mammal species, intercourse is often coordinated with ovulation - but the same phenomenon had been established in humans.   Overall, the researchers found that women had sex 0.29 times a day - or twice a week.   However, during the six most fertile days of their cycle the rate of intercourse averaged out at 0.34 times a day, compared to 0.27 times a day for the rest of the month - an increase of 24%.   Professor Wilcox said there were at least three possible explanations:    An increase in the woman's sex drive at ovulation  An increase in the woman's sexual attractiveness  Intercourse accelerating ovulation He said: "It's remarkable that the biological forces shaping this intimate aspect of human behaviour have gone largely unrecognized.   "For couples who want a baby these biological mechanisms are a silent partner, helping to optimize the timing of intercourse.   "For couples who do not want a baby, however, these data are a caution.   "Such couples need to know that nature is subtly working against them."

       The Globe and Mail   Your brain may show significant signs of aging by the time you are 40, new research has found.  Bruce Yankner, a Harvard Medical School researcher, has discovered that many genes, including several key ones associated with memory and learning, become damaged and stop working as people age, and the slowdown can begin as young as 40. His work could help explain why many people lose their keys more often as they get older, or have trouble summoning a word that is on the tip of their tongues. It may also offer clues into age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's.  Dr. Yankner performed a complicated molecular analysis on the brains of 30 individuals aged 26 to 106 years old. They died from a variety of medical and accidental causes. Their brains were normal for their age, and came from brain banks across the United States.  Using new screening techniques, he was able to document which genes were hard at work in their brains before they died.  Genes, found in every cell in our body, contain the instructions for proteins. In the case of the brain, these proteins are what keep it functioning.  Dr. Yankner found that roughly 180 genes, including about 20 known to play a role in learning, memory and other cognitive functions, were badly damaged in the brain cells taken from people over 70. Those same genes were working normally in the brains taken from people under 40.   Between 40 and 70, however, there was huge variability.  "Some middle-aged individuals exhibit gene patterns that look more like the young group, whereas others show gene patterns that look more like the old group," Dr. Yankner said in an interview.  This makes sense, he argued, because some people appear to age much faster than others.   "One interpretation, is young adults age at similar rates initially, but when they enter middle age they diverge and approach old age at different rates. You walk into the coffee shop and look at three middle-aged people. They could all look the same age but they could be years apart."   He also noticed a second distinct pattern in gene activity in the brain. As people age, genes involved in repairing damage in the brain, including genetic damage, increase significantly.  "One potential scenario is that we all go through this degenerative change, but how the brain compensates differs from individual to individual and may determine individual outcomes."   Further study may yield clues about why some people seem to age so much more rapidly than others. Dr. Yankner is also investigating whether these seemingly normal changes in the brain may play a role in age-related diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.   It may be that people who develop these diseases don't have an adequate repair mechanism to deal with the genetic damage that comes naturally with aging. It may one day be possible to identify who is most at risk, and to take measures to help them avoid problems later on, Dr. Yankner said. It could be that lifestyle plays a role, or it may be possible to develop drugs that could help.   Working with brain tissue in the lab, the researchers were able to use genetic engineering to repair the damage to the genes involved in memory and learning.   "We can repair these aging genes in the laboratory, but that is a far cry from the human brain. This is only a first step," Dr. Yankner said.   His study was published on-line yesterday by the journal Nature.

       CTV NEWS   Almost one-quarter of Canadians have been the victims of medical errors, according a new report. These mistakes have resulted in people taking up to an extra 1.1 million hospital beds annually.  The Canadian Institute for Health Information commissioned the report, Health Care in Canada 2004. Released Wednesday, it says Canadians experienced "preventable adverse events" with the following being the most common mistakes:  One in nine adults reported receiving the wrong medication or the wrong dose.  One in nine adults and one in 11 children caught an infection while in hospital. The most common infections were pneumonia, urinary tract infections and surgery site infections.  One in almost 7,000 patients had a foreign object, such as a sponge, left in them after surgery or a medical procedure.  One in 1, 100 senior citizens experienced hip fractures while in hospital or during surgery.  One birth trauma (for example a dislocated shoulder) occurred per 81 newborns. This study expands on a landmark report released last month that found preventable medical errors may be contributing to more than 20,000 deaths each year.  This report studied the number of mistakes and their effects on patients.   Dr. John Wade of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute said the lack of openness about mistakes must change. "If we don't change the culture from one of blame and shame to one of information sharing and solving the problems, we won't make much headway.''   In the past, the issue of openness has been hindered by the threat of lawsuits.   "This is a massive problem, which is only going to be dealt with by thoughtful effort -- not by blaming people, but by finding a way of bringing the errors into the open. So we can find better ways of doing things," said Michael Decter, the former chair of the institute.   "The main reason people litigate in the health system is because they feel they were misled, " he added.  Some suggested solutions for reducing errors include ensuring mistakes can be reported without the threat of liability to medical staff, and improving accuracy through methods such as electronic medical records.  Medical errors have been in the news this week. Health authorities in Victoria, B.C. are asking 300 patients to be tested for Hepatitis B and C along with HIV, after a possible contamination was discovered in dialysis machines at the Royal Jubilee Hospital.  This report follows news last week that the infection, clostridium difficile, has afflicted 1, 400 people in Montreal and Calgary and killed 79 people. Hospitals in both cities are battling outbreaks of the infection. The outbreak is blamed on the use of a popular antacid medication commonly used in Quebec and Alberta to treat ulcers and gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

       BBC News    The stroke death rate in an area of the country has been cut by 40%, according to a new study published in the Lancet.    The report said preventative medicine and increased management of risk factors by GPs were responsible.   The two-year project in Oxford found the rate had fallen despite a big rise in the elderly population.   The leader of the study said he expected the results would be replicated around the country if a similar nationwide study was conducted.   Strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is disrupted. In most cases, this happens when a blood clot blocks an artery carrying blood to the brain.   Strokes are the most common cause of death in England and Wales after heart disease and cancer and are the biggest drain on the NHS's resources.   The team, under Dr Peter Rothwell of the Radcliffe Infirmary, compared stroke rates in the county over 2002-2004 with a similar study from the 1980s.   Incidences of a first stroke fell by about 30% in the second study, despite the number of people over 75 increasing by 33%.   For major disabling or fatal stroke, the reduction was 40%.   'Wealthy area'  Dr Rothwell said: "Although we cannot prove conclusively that the major fall in stroke incidence is a direct result of the measured increase in use of preventive medication, a causal link is highly likely.   He told BBC News Online the major credit had to go to GPs, who were recognising more and more that high blood pressure had to be treated early.   The team was careful to have chosen a representative sample, he said.   "Even though Oxfordshire is a relatively wealthy area, we made a point of ensuring that we included patients from deprived areas in our study."   He explained why such a large fall might not be reflected in the national figures.   "The mortality figures are not reliable where strokes are concerned, and not - to an extent - are hospital discharge figures.   "Cancer figures for example are very good, but stroke was often used as a 'dustbin' diagnosis when an elderly person dies for an unknown reason."   'Study welcomed'   He said only an in-depth national study such as this would be able to give a true picture.   The Stroke Association welcomed the study's findings.   "This study shows that preventative approaches against the condition can reduce its incidence," said Dr Joanne Knight, associate director of research and development.   "This is not just in terms of taking medication but also by making simple lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and stopping smoking.   "Adopting these methods will help to reduce the effects of this devastating disease, but will also reduce financial burden on an already overstretched NHS."

       The Globe and Mail   Here's an interesting bit of headache trivia: In the past year, 50 per cent of neurologists have had at least one migraine, compared to 32 per cent of family physicians, and 12 per cent of the general public.  So, what's up with that? Are neurologists more prone to migraines because of their big brains? Are they just more neurotic than ordinary working stiffs? Are they drawn to neurology because their own brains are wonky?  None of the above, according to new research presented yesterday at the American Headache Society scientific meeting in Vancouver.   Rather, neurologists are just more informed on how to recognize and respond to cries for help from the grey matter.  And the fact that they treat themselves so frequently for migraines suggests that far more members of the general public suffer from migraine headaches than previously believed.  "We believe migraine is much more common than we realize," said Jonathan Gladstone, a neurology resident at the University of Toronto who, for the record, suffers a few migraines a year himself.   He's even willing to admit that he misdiagnosed himself.  "For years, I believed I had ordinary 'tension-type' headaches, but once I began specializing in neurology, I was able to recognize that they were indeed migraines," Dr. Gladstone said.  So what is the difference between a migraine, a tension headache, and a sinus headache?  A migraine is essentially a really bad headache that lasts for more than four hours and is accompanied by certain telltale symptoms -- such as sensitivity to light, sound or colours. Migraine can also be a chronic, debilitating condition.  A tension headache is characterized by a dull, annoying but generally bearable pain. And a sinus headache is, well, increasingly looking like a sign that your doctor is not quite informed enough.  "Sinus headaches are greatly overdiagnosed and overtreated," said Dr. Gladstone, who is also a fellow at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz.   "The majority of people who think they have sinus headaches unknowingly have migraines." (The confusion stems from the fact that migraine pain is often felt in the sinus and neck.)  The distinction is important because migraines don't respond to traditional painkillers such as acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). And sinus medication doesn't help either.  Rather, migraines are best treated with triptans, a prescription medication. They include sumatriptan (sold under the brand names Imitrex and Imigran) and eletriptan (Relpax). Many doctors hesitate at prescribing triptans because they can cause side effects such as chest pain. (But new research suggests that the drugs do not increase the risk of heart disease.)  Dr. Gladstone's research was based on a survey of 135 neurologists, including 75 in Toronto and 60 who work at three Mayo clinics.   A second, unrelated study presented yesterday at the Headache Society, revealed that children and teenagers who get frequent headaches are being grossly overmedicated.  "I've been astounded by the large number of kids using over-the-counter medications five or six times a week -- and sometimes 15 to 20 times a week," said David Rothner, director emeritus of child neurology at The Children's Hospital in Cleveland.  According to the research, one in four children with frequent headaches uses medication to excess -- meaning they take three doses or more a week for 14 weeks or more.  "Even more frightening was that a lot of them were taking the drugs without telling their parents," Dr. Rothner said.  The researcher said he has treated children for serious medical conditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney failure that were caused by excessive use of popular drugs like ibuprofen. (Children should never take ASA or Aspirin because it has been linked to potentially deadly Reye's syndrome.)  He said too few people realize that over-the-counter headache remedies should be used sparingly because otherwise they lose their effectiveness.   "Overuse can lead to rebound, chronic daily headache," Dr. Rothner said.   In effect, taking too many drugs for tension headaches can lead to chronic migraines, a much more serious condition.  Migraine headaches are often referred to as an invisible epidemic. They are the leading cause of absenteeism in the workplace.  More than $500-million is lost yearly in Canada due to migraine headaches. The condition affects more than 3.3 million Canadians.

       PublicHealthNews.com   Figures published this spring indicate that, in parts of Scotland, the average man’s life expectancy is as low as 63 years – 12 years below women from the same area. Nationally the discrepancies are not so pronounced – women live on average five years longer than men – but these figures are a stark reminder that men’s health is an issue that needs addressing in its own right. Despite our relative wealth, the health of some men in this country trails behind that of their counterparts in less developed countries. In Jamaica, for example, male life expectancy is 73.5 years.   The formation of organsations actively working to reduce inequalities between men and women, and the successful introduction of the national Men’s Health Week, has helped push men’s health onto the policy agenda, and although the government has yet to demonstrate its commitment by introducing gender-specific health policies, practitioners on the ground are increasingly looking for ways to reach out to those groups of men who have traditionally been disinclined to take an interest in their health.    The discrepancy between male and female life expectancy rates in the UK is partly attributable to the fact that early detection rates of serious illnesses in men, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and lung disease, lag behind those of women. Early presentation to health services can save lives but some men are reluctant to visit their GP.    In the 12 months to March 2003, 68 per cent of males had contact with their GP, compared to 84 per cent of females. Even those men who experienced symptoms of ill health were still unwilling to make a doctor’s appointment. Research shows that men wait an average of three to four months between discovering a symptom of testicular cancer and visiting their GP – a particularly galling statistic given that survival rates for testicular cancer are high if tumours are detected at an early stage.   While both sexes may be reluctant to undergo medical tests – a negative diagnosis is of course a very real fear for both men and women alike – it is the cultural differences between genders that seem to imbue in many men an aversion to seeking out medical advice. Unwilling to admit to physical vulnerabilities, many men are inclined to ignore any symptoms they have in the hope that they will disappear of their own accord.    ‘If you think of how men are brought up, and what masculinity means, it’s about being seen to be tough. Having an illness isn’t consistent with those images,’ says Peter Baker, director of the Men’s Health Forum. But disparities between male and female life expectancy are not solely down to cultural differences, Mr Baker adds. He argues that gender inequalities in health are also attributable to a failure on the part of health services to make themselves more attractive to men. ‘Health promotion campaigns don’t tend to engage with men and doctors don’t do much to market themselves to men.’   Many women are likely to have long-established relationships with local health services – mothers, in particular, will have been in regular contact with health services throughout their pregnancy and the early years of their children’s lives whereas, between the ages of 16 and 45, men are often only in sporadic contact with their GP. Some practitioners feel that this makes a GP’s surgery an unwelcoming environment for some men.    A waiting room packed full of women and children may further intimidate those who are averse to attending in the first place. Nor are the nine-to-five opening hours conducive to bringing men in for health checks, says Dr Howard Stoate, MP and chair of the all-party group on men’s health. ‘I think some men can be reluctant to ask their boss for time off work to visit their GP. There is an ingrained view that it’s wimpish to be ill.’    But this doesn’t mean we should presume that men are unwilling to talk about their health, adds Dr Stoate. What they need is an opportunity to access health services in a setting that is more ‘male-friendly’. ‘We assume that men don’t like to talk about their health altogether but that’s not true. What they don’t want to do is talk about it in the traditional medical setting, but they will do it in a setting they feel comfortable in.’   Mr Baker agrees. Men, he believes, do tend to respond to services if they are offered in non-clinical settings. ‘Experience shows that, if you offer health checks in the right setting, men will use the service. It undermines the myth that men aren’t interested in their own health. It’s about being creative – if you are serious about improving men’s health and getting diseases detected earlier, you have to design services differently.’   A number of primary care trusts are beginning to do just that. In a bid to reach out to those men who are reluctant to engage with health services via the traditional route, some health practitioners are now offering health checks in non-clinical settings. Last year, Horsham and Chanctonbury PCT, in conjunction with Horsham District Council, offered health screening for men in a number of unusual venues, including leisure centres, pubs, social clubs and the local shopping centre.    Checks were offered on blood pressure, weight and height, cholesterol, blood glucose levels and carbon monoxide levels. A third of those tested were found to have high cholesterol, and around 15 per cent had high levels of blood sugar and were referred to their GP.   It proved an effective way of destigmatising health issues for those men reluctant to visit the doctor of their own accord, says Darrell Gale, who is jointly appointed by both the council and PCT as a health promotion specialist. ‘We were aware that men don’t access primary care services as much as women do, and felt we needed to offer a different way of doing things. We wanted to show them that health practitioners don’t bite!’   Levels of life expectancy for men in Horsham are among the highest in the country, but Mr Gale says that statistics mask the fact that there are areas of deprivation locally where male life expectancy remains low, and it was these areas that the outreach initiative targeted. The focus now at Horsham is to try to improve the flexibility of health services to increase their accessibility for men by, for example, extending opening hours. But breaking down barriers to service provision is not always easy, he admits. ‘Services do have to think outside the box, but it can add pressure on resources. We’re not able to offer outreach work on a regular basis because of resource issues.’   Dr Stoate believes that the type of services that were offered to men in Horsham should become part of mainstream service provision.  To argue that a lack of resources prevents this from becoming more widespread is to miss the point, he says. ‘I’d like to see [outreach work] as a much more formal arrangement. It should be seen as part of the preventative agenda. We should be looking more critically at resources and at how we spend them. If it means you’re able to identify those men at risk of diabetes, for example, then the initial costs are clearly going to be offset in the long term.’    One PCT aiming to mainstream outreach services for men is Knowsley. It has recently commissioned Healthworks to carry out a pilot series of health checks for men aged 50 to 64 in non-clinical settings, starting this month. It is part of a broader plan to address health inequalities for men in the area, where life expectancy lags behind the national average. ‘Generally these sorts of initiatives seem to be short-term, which isn’t what we want to do here. We want to see this as a long-term project, and we will expand to men of all ages in the future.    ‘Ultimately we want the service to be mainstreamed, and run by core PCT staff,’ says Diana Forest, director of public health at the PCT. The aim behind the pilot health checks is not just to improve detection rates for those men who attend the checks, but also to raise the profile of men’s health within the community. ‘We want to make a big noise locally to get people talking. If it gets people to think about men’s health then that in itself will achieve some of our objectives.’   Airedale PCT, as part of the Health of Men network – a comprehensive multi-agency initiative working to improve the health of men in the Bradford area – has been offering health screening to men in a variety of settings for some time. Initial attempts to offer drop-in sessions in the town centre failed to attract many takers, but the scheme has now been expanded to other locations with far greater success.    In particular, health checks offered on-site at various local companies have proved effective, according to Chris Bradley, men’s health services coordinator at Airedale PCT. ‘We have offered health checks in a variety of firms, including an electrical retailer and a builders merchant. We have found the staff to be genuinely interested, and the employers are happy to be involved. The council, especially, has been very supportive – it actually paid its employees to attend those sessions that were held on their days off, which was a really forward way of thinking.’   The next step in Bradford is to try to set up a system that would allow the PCT to monitor the number of men who attend health checks and then follow it up with a visit to their GP. Such a system would improve the evaluation of the outreach work, which is currently evaluated on an anecdotal basis. ‘Our long-term challenge is to try to prove the value of this sort of preventative work. Ideally, I would like to see it mainstreamed, as I do think the benefits outweigh the initial investment if you take a long-term view.’

       TIME    Drugs carry risks, but they can work wonders. What the new studies show   Suffering from severe depression yourself is bad enough. The smallest effort seems huge; feeling happy, or even content, is impossible to imagine. Things can get so bad that suicide may seem the only rational course. But it's almost worse when your child is depressed. Watching someone you love go through such misery is agonizing. You would do anything to help.   But figuring out what to do has grown more confusing. One of the best tools for fighting depression is the so-called SSRI class of drugs, including Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft. But evidence has been mounting that these relatively safe medications might trigger suicidal thoughts in some kids. While there's no proof that the drugs have actually caused any suicides, British authorities pretty much banned everything but Prozac last December for children under 18. And in March, the FDA warned that anyone taking antidepressants, including Prozac, should be monitored for emotional agitation.   Then, two weeks ago, results from the first major government-sponsored study of SSRIs and children came in. It showed that Prozac is more effective for kids than a popular form of traditional talk therapy called cognitive behavior therapy — and that when combined, Prozac and therapy together are most effective of all.   So Prozac, at least, has clear benefits. But it probably has risks as well. "It's really understandable that people are confused," says Carol Glod, director of developmental studies at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. "We just haven't studied antidepressant drugs in kids enough to make many definitive statements." Part of the problem is that the brain chemistry of kids is different from adults'. Prozac works for both groups, but Paxil seems to work only for grownups. Kids, moreover, are amazingly responsive to placebos. While 70% of kids get better on Zoloft, for example, 60% improve on sugar pills.   There's obviously no point risking side effects from a drug that doesn't work. But for the ones that do, the danger of suicidal tendencies can be minimized with careful monitoring by parents and practitioners. It's clear that at least some antidepressants, taken in conjunction with conventional therapy, can be a reasonably safe way out of the despair of childhood depression.

       The Globe and Mail   Being fluently bilingual may help stave off the forgetfulness and inattention associated with aging, according to a new Canadian study.  Researchers at York University in Toronto found that older people who had spoken two languages concurrently their whole lives fared markedly better on tests that measure cognitive function.  In particular, the bilinguals scored highest on measures of so-called fluid intelligence -- the ability to focus one's attention and to respond to rapidly changing tasks -- said Ellen Bialystok, a professor of psychology at York.  The findings, published in today's edition of the Journal of Psychology and Aging, suggest that being bilingual may offer some protection against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.  The research is the latest to make a link between linguistic facility and the health of the brain.   It also adds to a growing body of evidence on the physiological and psychological benefits of bilingualism, though most of that research has been done on children. The studies have shown that children who speak two languages or more tend to be more creative, better at problem-solving, and score better on literacy tests.  Bilingual children also tend to have an economic advantage as they mature because they have better job prospects.  Research has shown that, when bilingual children process information, both languages remain active, even though they use one language at a time. To ensure that the languages remains separate, the brain develops mechanisms to allow the speaker to block out intrusions from the unwanted language.  Dr. Bialystok's new research suggests that this ability to compartmentalize and focus carries over the other functions, and that's why bilinguals remains sharper as they age.  The research involved a total of 154 bilingual and monolingual adult university graduates living in Toronto and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The bilingual participants all spoke Tamil and English fluently, and used both languages concurrently on a daily basis since childhood.   The subjects underwent a common psychological test known as the Simon task. Using flashing squares on a computer screen, the test can measure reaction time in a variety of ways.  On the Simon test, the older bilingual adults (age 60-88) did far better than their monolingual counterparts. In fact, their results were about the same as those of younger (age 30-59) unilinguals.   Dr. Bialystok said it is important to stress that the bilingual participants spoke English and Tamil every day, so it is unclear if the apparent benefits would apply to people who speak a second language only occasionally.

       BBC NEWS    Eating fruit could protect against an age-related eye disease which can cause blindness, research suggests.    Researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston followed the progress of over 118,000 people for between 12 and 18 years.   Those who ate three or more servings of fruit a day were 36% less likely to develop age-related maculopathy than people who ate less than 1.5 per day.   The study is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology.  Age-related maculopathy, or age-related macular degeneration, is the leading cause of blindness in people over 65.   The condition is caused by the deterioration of the macula, a part of the light sensitive layer in the eye called the retina.   The cells either break down, or the tissue is damaged by the growth of blood vessels under the retina.   There is a treatment for the condition, but no cure.   Previous research has shown antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation protects against the condition, and that supplementation with high-doses of vitamins C and E, beta carotene and zinc delays its progress.   Diet survey   The researchers in this study looked at how the amount of fruit, vegetables and vitamins people ate related to their risk of developing the eye disease.   They followed 77,562 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study and 40,866 men who were taking part in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.   All were at least 50 years old when the study began with no diagnosis of ARM. Women were followed for up to 18 years, and men were followed for up to 12 years.   Women completed questionnaires about their diets up to five times over the follow-up period (in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990 and 1994), and men three times, in 1986, 1990, and 1994.   They also reported their vitamin and supplement use once every two years.   Over the follow-up period, 329 women and 135 men were diagnosed with early stage ARM, and 217 women and 99 men with neovascular ARM, a more severe type of the condition.   While three or more portions of fruit a day was found to significantly cut someone's risk of developing neovascular ARM - a severe form of the disease, eating more vegetables did not appear to hold any benefit.   Bananas and oranges were strongly linked with protective benefits.   Researchers also found that levels of antioxidant vitamins or carotenoids - compounds responsible for the red, yellow and orange pigments found in some fruits and vegetables - were not directly related to ARM risk.   Food versus supplements   Writing in the journal, the researchers led by Dr Eunyoung Cho, said: "Fruit intake was inversely related to age-related maculopathy, particularly neovascular ARM, the form of this disease that frequently involves severe vision loss.   "Since none of the antioxidants or carotenoids contributed substantially, other factors may also contribute to the reduced risk."   They suggest other constituents of fruits with potential health benefit include flavanoids, fibre, folate and potassium.   Catherine Collins, a dietician based at St George's Hospital in London, said the study findings made sense because certain substances found in fruit had specific benefits for eye health.   She said the beneficial link with fruit may have been clearer in this study because people did not eat enough of lutein-rich vegetables such as spinach for them to have a noticeable effect.   She added: "There are substances in foods which give you extra benefits compared to vitamin and mineral supplements."

       BBC NEWS    Women with short legs have a higher risk of developing heart disease than their leggier sisters, researchers say.    A study of more than 4,000 women by Bristol University looked at leg length because it is an indicator of childhood diet and living conditions.   Other factors, such as being older, obese and smoking were found to increase heart disease risk.   But writing in Heart, the researchers said women's risk decreased by 16% for every extra 4.3cm in leg length.   Researchers from Bristol University's Department of Social Medicine measured the height, leg length, trunk length and weight of women aged between 60 and 79 from across Britain.   They also tested how well their lungs worked, whether they were former or current smokers, and noted their social class.   Almost 700 of the 4,000 women had heart disease. Just under one third (31%) of the 700 had a history of heart attacks.   These women were more likely to have poorer lung function, higher cholesterol levels and to be more insulin resistant, which can be an indication they will go on to develop diabetes, and to come from working class families.   'Early life'   But even when all these risk factors were taken into account, leg length was still strongly linked to a woman's risk of developing heart disease.   Those who had experienced heart problems had leg lengths ranging from 746.2 to 752.6mm. compared to healthy women whose legs measured 757.5 to 760.3mm.   Dr Debbie Lawlor, who led the study, said: "The protective effect of tall stature is unlikely to be the result of wider arteries or to less height shrinkage with age."   Instead, she said it was likely to be an indication of environmental factors from birth up to puberty which affected both growth of the bones in the legs and which have a long-term effect on future heart disease risk.   She added: "Breast feeding, high energy diets at the age of two and being born into an affluent family all positively influence growth; having parents who smoke and being born into a poor family negatively influence growth.   'Controllable risk factors'   "The association between leg length and heart disease suggests that these early life risk factors also cause heart disease."   Judy O'Sullivan, a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Latest figures show that around 53,000 UK women die each year of heart disease.   "What this study highlights is that factors which stunt growth such as smoking and poor diet also increase your risk of coronary heart disease."   She added: "It was also noted that the women with CHD were more likely to be either current or ex-smokers, have high cholesterol levels and be obese.   "The many controllable risk factors which have long been associated with CHD, such as smoking, eating an unbalanced diet, high blood pressure and inactivity, must not be forgotten."

       BBC NEWS    Scientists have discovered why some breast cancers fail to respond to the drug tamoxifen - and found a way to combat the problem.    They have shown that another cancer drug - gefitinib - may be able to destroy a tumour's resistance to tamoxifen's anti-cancer effect.   If confirmed, the finding could provide new hope for many patients.   The study, by Baylor College of Medicine, is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.   Tamoxifen has been shown to reduce the risk of death from women with advanced breast cancer by about 15% over 10 to 15 years.   However, the drug only works for women whose tumours are sensitive to the female sex hormone oestrogen. These are known as ER-positive tumours.   And even among this group, it appears that only 40% to 50% actually benefit from taking tamoxifen.   Studies have shown that resistance to the drug is higher among ER-positive tumours that also produce high levels of two other chemicals, called HER2 and AIB1.   The Baylor team studied molecular interactions in breast cancer cells that expressed high levels of both HER2 and AIB1.   They found that, in these cells, tamoxifen actually seemed to promote the effect of oestrogen, and stimulate tumour growth.   However, when the breast cancer cells were treated with gefitinib this seemed to restore the ability of tamoxifen to block both the action of oestrogen and tumour growth.   The researchers say that using drugs like gefitinib alone has little impact on tamoxifen-resistant ER-positive tumours.   But they say their work does provide a strong case for combining the two drugs to overcome resistance.   'More research needed'   Dr Michelle Barclay of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "These are interesting results that could, in the long term, benefit some women who unfortunately develop a resistance to tamoxifen.   "However, the results are very preliminary and we look forward to further research into this combination, and results of clinical trials.   "Studies like these are important as they enable us to understand more about the biology of breast cancer and how different treatments work, ultimately aiming to provide the best treatment suitable for each woman."   Samia al Qadhi, of Breast Cancer Care, was also very positive about the research.   She said: "We know that many women worry about the possible implications of being told that their breast cancer is resistant to tamoxifen.   "We look forward to seeing the results of clinical trials being carried out into the efficacy of gefitinib in restoring tamoxifen's anti-cancer properties in these women."   Dr Emma Croager, Science Information Officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "This is important research, which has identified that cross-talk between the HER2 and oestrogen receptor signalling pathways contributes to tamoxifen resistance.   "Resistance is a major problem in the treatment of breast cancer.   "This work suggests that combined treatment with tamoxifen and gefitinib could overcome tamoxifen resistance.   "Clinical trials are underway to test this new treatment strategy and we will be interested to see the results."

       BBC NEWS    Scientists have developed a method which they say could predict when a woman will go through the menopause.    As female fertility starts to decline rapidly around 10 years before this happens, the information could help women decide when to have a family.   Writing in Human Reproduction, the Scottish researchers say it could "revolutionise" family planning.   But they stress more research is needed before women will be able to go to their doctor for an assessment.   The human ovary contains a fixed pool of immature eggs, which form in the fourth month of pregnancy.   They peak at several million in the five-month foetus then start to decline. By birth, this number has already fallen significantly and the decline continues relentlessly.   The number reaches around 25,000, usually at around the age of 37, then the decline accelerates more rapidly.   By the time a woman is about to go through the menopause, this number will have fallen to around 1,000 - too few to generate a mature egg capable of being fertilised.   IVF success   The experts showed that it was possible to tell how many eggs a woman still had in her ovaries by measuring their size.   On average, a woman will go through the menopause aged around 50, but it can happen as early as 42 and as late as 58.   The team created a model estimating the size of an 'average' woman's ovaries throughout her reproductive life.   Using that model, they say it will be possible to assess whether a woman is likely to have an earlier or later menopause, based on her ovarian size.   Long-term studies will now follow young healthy women - carrying out regular assessments of ovarian volume until they reach the menopause - to carry out a full test of the hypothesis.   The researchers say the information will be useful for women who have cancer treatment when young, which could affect their fertility.   They also say it will help women who are undergoing IVF - as it has been shown that women with smaller ovaries have less chance of success.   But they say it will also be useful for women who are planning to delay having a family, for professional or personal reasons.   Dr Hamish Wallace, consultant paediatric oncologist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, Scotland, led the study.   He said the research "opened the door" to the possibility of screening women to see if they were likely to face an early menopause.   He added: "There is currently no reliable test of ovarian reserve for an individual woman that will predict accurately her remaining reproductive life-span.   The method, he said "may allow us to predict for a woman, aged 25-50, what ovarian reserves she has and at what age she is likely to experience the menopause".   "In essence, it means we now have the potential to be able to tell a woman how fast her biological clock is ticking and how much time she has before it will run down."   Counselling 'crucial'   The researchers are also studying young women successfully treated for cancer to hopefully give them better fertility advice - allowing them to realistically plan a family.   Professor Bill Ledger, a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told BBC News Online: "What we're trying to do is tell women how much fertile time they have left."   He said that, while women in their 40s could become pregnant, it was rare because their egg quality declines.   He added: "Most, although not all, women have in their minds that they will have children at some point.   "They want to know what their individual chance of becoming pregnant is, so they can plan."   A spokeswoman for the Teenage Cancer Trust said: "Fertility is a major concern for survivors of teenage cancer as their fertility is often affected by their treatment.

       CTV   Certain common medical illnesses significantly boost the risk of suicide in seniors, whose signs of depression often go undiagnosed by their own family docters, according to a new study.  The Canadian study was sponsored by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and published in the journal, Archives of Internal Medicine. It spanned nine years and looked at more than 1,300 suicides committed by elderly patients.   The study found that the more illnesses a patient had, the greater the risk they would take their own lives.  Seniors already have the highest rate of suicide among all age groups in Canada.  "As you age, the risk of suicide goes up substantially," said Dr. David Juurlink, a specialist in internal medicine and a clinical pharmacologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.  "And people, when they are older, when they attempt suicide, attempt it with considerably more lethal means."  Juurlink is the lead author of the study tracking suicides among Ontario seniors 66 years of age and older between 1992 and 2000.   His study found the most common tools used in suicides included firearms (28 per cent), hanging (24 per cent), and self-poisoning (21 per cent).  The study also revealed that half of the patients who took their lives had been to see a doctor in the previous week.  "I think we have a lot of potentially missed opportunities for prevention," Juurlink said.   "Especially in the offices of family doctors who see these patients in the days and weeks before they take their own lives.  Fran, 71, began sliding into a deep depression a decade ago,  having been diagnosed with a form of muscular dystrophy that left her weak and unable to care for herself.  "You reach a point where you question, do I want to continue living like this?" she said.   "I thought of suicide," she said. "I didn't know that I would ever do it ... but I hated the life I was leading."  Dr.David Conn of Baycrest Centre for Geriatrics said seniors like Fran are not alone in her feelings, although many fall through the cracks.   "There's a lot of evidence that many seniors with depression are not being identified and treated," Conn said.   Luckily, Fran was prescribed the right dose of medication, along with talk therapy to treat her depression and thoughts of suicide.  "I have five wonderful children and grandchildren," she said. "I did not want them to remember me that way."

       Medical News today   A special licensing committee of the UK Human Fertilization & Embryology Authority (HFEA) met on June 16 in London to decide whether to grant a license to scientists at The Center for Life at Newcastle University. If approved, this will be the first license to begin research involving cell nuclear replacement (therapeutic cloning), focusing on the treatment of diabetes in the UK and will be a first in Europe.   Therapeutic cloning, for the derivation of embryonic stem cells, has the potential to lead to cures for serious diseases such as Alheizmer's, Parkinson's, heart failure and cancer. The UK has a strict regulatory system for human embryonic stem cell research. If the license is approved, it will allow this important work to begin. The UK was one of the first countries in the world to pass legislation to explicitly ban reproductive cloning.   Dr. Miodrag Stojkovic of Newcastle University who leads the research team said that he was very happy that the law in the UK allows scientists to work in this very promising field and use their knowledge in stem cell biology and nuclear transfer technique to bring faster and more efficient stem cells from the bench to the patient's bed.  Newcastle University's Institute of Human Genetics and the Life Fertility Center is one of only two groups in the UK to derive human ES (embryonic stem cells) from spare IVF embryos.   ES cells can be used to make any cell type in the body and replace cells that have been lost as a result of disease or injury. Cells derived from ES cells may often be genetically different from the patient, and transplanted cells could be rejected by the patient's immune system.   The Newcastle stem cell group will use nuclear transfer to derive stem cells that are genetically identical to those of a patient. In this case the stem cells and cells derived from them would not be rejected after being transplanted into a patient.   Dr. Stojkovic explained that he plans to perform the cloning of dozens of embryos using the same technique employed by the scientists who created Dolly the sheep in 1997. The project will use cloned embryos to create insulin-producing cells that can be transplanted into people suffering from diabetes.   The procedure involves reprogramming cells from skin tissue of a patient who has lost important cells through disease or injury. The re-programmed cells will re-grow as the cells needed by that patient. For a child with diabetes this could then mean that he or she would not need to take insulin or any other medicines and would effectively be cured.   The process requires the nucleus from a skin cell to be removed and placed into an unfertilized egg. This egg is then stimulated to divide until a group of cells form. Stem cells are then isolated from this group and have the potential to grow into any cell type in the body. If directed to make insulin cells, a cure would be achieved.   Professor Alison Murdoch who leads the Newcastle Fertility Center at Life said that eggs would be donated for this research by patients undergoing treatment for fertility at the Center. Professor Murdoch said, "we are very grateful to all those patients who help with this research. Although the studies will not directly help them, they are playing a vital role in helping other patients."   Alastair Balls, chief executive for the Center for Life said, "This is undoubtedly one of the most important areas of research in human fertility and genetics capable of having a transformational effect on medical treatments. It is great news that Newcastle through the combination of the University, the NHS Trust and the Center is able to be one of the world leaders in this field.

       BBC NEWS    Problems encountered by babies in the womb may damage not only their health, but that of the next generation, research suggests.   Edinburgh University scientists found exposure to excess hormones in the womb appears to increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes in later life.   The findings also suggest problems can carry to the next generation, but peter out before reaching grandchildren.   The research is published in the American Journal of Physiology.   A baby is normally protected from the high levels of steroid hormones in the mother by the placenta.   However, studies have shown that low birth-weight babies have been exposed to higher levels of the mother's own steroid hormones crossing the placenta during pregnancy.   Researcher Dr Mandy Drake said: "We believe that exposing the developing baby to excess steroid hormones can alter the expression of key genes which affect foetal growth and later risk of disease which can be passed on to the next generation.   "We are now investigating the mechanisms behind this to try and explain the short and long-term complications associated with low birth-weight in humans, which may also have a significant impact upon the health of subsequent generations.   "The better news is that the effect appears to be lost in the third generation.   "This may explain why some diseases appear to run in families for a couple of generations, then peter out."   Adverse conditions   Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study, said it was increasingly being recognised that adverse conditions in the womb can lead to a higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease when the baby grows up, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood.   He said: "This study shows that one causal factor is exposure to increased stress hormone before birth.   "Importantly, the authors also found that this increased risk can be passed on for at least one further generation.   "This means that a mother's health might not only affect her unborn child, but her unborn grandchild too.   "These results reinforce how important it is that pregnant mothers watch what they eat and try to maintain good health."

       Medical News Today   If you smoke and you are under 35 you can still expect to live as long as someone who has never smoked if you quit now, a new study reveals.   Researchers said that in their studies, only the people who had given up smoking 15 years or more before they began their study had any chance of a similar life expectancy of a lifelong non-smoker.   They also stressed that making a decision to take up smoking knowing that you will give up before you are 35 is wishful thinking – giving up is very hard and most people fail on the first attempt.   The study was carried out at Duke University, North Carolina, USA, and was led by Dr. Taylor.   The researchers said that we often overlook how badly smoking affects our quality of life while we are still alive. Most of the focus is on life expectancy. But smoking, they say, undermines you general health and quality of life while you are alive.   In this study, the researchers studied the transcripts of interviews that had been carried out with middle-aged and elderly people. They talked about their health and whether they smoked or not and when they had given up. Over a period of many years these people were contacted again (on several occasions). The aim was to see how their health altered.   Most people, they found, had predictable health patterns according to how they described their health at the time. The researchers calculated how long these people could expect to live and live healthily.   They found that smokers lived less long than lifetime non smokers. They also found that smokers had longer periods of bad health while they were alive. Those who had given up 15 years (or more) before the start of the study lived as long as non smokers and enjoyed similar periods of good health while they were alive.   Even smokers who did not complain of health problems lived less time than non smokers.   It is crucial, they said, that you are not a smoker when health problems start. The longer the period of non-smoking before a health problem, the longer you are likely to live and the better your health will be while you are alive, they said.   The message here, they say, is to focus on the quality of life you want while you are alive – and not just to acknowledge that smoking shortens your life. Therefore, the argument that it is better to live a short happy life than a long boring one does not stand – the smoker will most likely have a short and unhappy life in comparison to the non-smoker.

       BBC NEWS   The largest ever study of its kind has found that cot deaths peak at weekends.    University of Aberdeen researchers looked at about 13,000 cot deaths which occurred between 1986 and 1998.   Writing in Archives of Disease in Childhood, they said that despite a big fall in cot deaths during the 1990s, numbers were still higher at weekends.   The 'Back to Sleep' campaign in the early 1990s advised babies should sleep on their backs. Deaths fell from 1,700 in 1986 to 395 in 1998.   The researchers analysed the number and timing of deaths attributable to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or cot death, from national statistics for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.   They looked at deaths between 1986 to 1990, before the 'Back to Sleep' campaign, and between 1993 and 1998, after it.   While there was an overall fall of around 75%, deaths continued to peak on Saturdays and Sundays, continuing to account for just under a third of the total number of deaths.   The researchers found there was actually a small increase after the campaign, with the proportion of deaths at the weekend rising from just over 31% to just over 32%.   The pattern was more evident among babies aged up to four months.   In the second period, almost 4% more babies in this age group died at weekends than babies aged five months or more.   'Can't change lifestyles'   Professor Peter Helms, of the Department of Child Health at the University of Aberdeen, who led the research, told BBC News Online: "It might be that parents 'don't want to bother the doctor', or have problems accessing healthcare at weekends.   "Or it could be that people are more relaxed at weekends - maybe they don't have to be up early to get the other kids off to school, or they may lie in after going out on a Saturday night."   He said it would not be possible to change people's lifestyles.   But Professor Helms added: "Healthcare professionals could consider improving access to healthcare at weekends."   A spokesman for the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths said: "It has long been known that sudden unexpected infant deaths are more likely to occur at weekends than weekdays.   "There is speculation as to why that may be, but no evidence-based answers.   "Until more is known about why these tragedies occur - through improved investigation of each death and through more basic research into causation - it is not possible to know for certain why babies are more likely to die at weekends."   He added: "It is important to note that the increased incidence of sudden unexpected infant deaths at weekends is very small - less than 4% greater than on weekdays - so parents should not be worried unduly by this."

       New Scientist   A naturally decaffeinated coffee plant has been discovered. Coffee from the new strain could be tastier than existing decaf brews, which can lose flavour compounds when caffeine is extracted with solvents.   Other caffeine-free plants have been reported, but the latest comes from the same genetic stock as today’s elite commercial strains. This means the decaffeinated trait should be relatively easy to breed into popular types of coffee.  “This is the first report of a decaffeinated variety of Coffea arabica,” says Paulo Mazzafera, head of the team at the University of Campinas, Brazil, which isolated the strains. “This species is the most cultivated species in the world, responsible for more than 75 per cent of traded coffee,” he says.   The discovery is welcome news for an industry which has struggled to cross elite varieties with more distantly related decaffeinated species.   “So far, caffeine-free natural coffees have been Madagascan species which are outside the mainstream, and not easy to breed from,” says Pablo Dubois, head of operations at the International Coffee Organization, in London, UK.   “This should be a step forward in terms of getting high quality decaffeinated coffee,” says Dubois, not least because extraction of caffeine with solvents would no longer be necessary. “There’s always a risk of losing flavour compounds, although there are examples of very good flavour in today’s decaffeinated products.”    Tree screening    Mazzafera and his colleagues discovered three naturally decaffeinated varieties after screening 3000 Ethiopian coffee trees, representing 300 strains. Experiments on the plants demonstrated that they lacked caffeine synthase, the enzyme in leaves that converts a compound called theobromine into caffeine.   As well as eliminating the need for solvent extraction, the discovery could also be an alternative to decaffeinated plants created by knocking out the gene for the same enzyme via genetic engineering (New Scientist, 18 June 2003). Some consumers are unlikely to accept these.  Mazzafera says that it might be possible to produce commercial decaffeinated coffee directly from the newly discovered strains within five years.   “I haven’t tasted them yet, but in general, C. arabica tastes OK,” he says. Programmes to breed the trait into existing elite strains could take longer, perhaps 15 years, he says.   “It would also provide a way for developing countries to compete with big companies which produce industrially decaffeinated coffee,” says Mazzafera.

       Medical News Today   Swedish scientists have found that breast milk contains a compound that destroys skin warts, it could also protect against cervical cancer and an array of fatal diseases. The human papilloma virus causes skin warts. It is a very common virus.   The scientists tried applying human breast-milk to the skin and found that the human papilloma virus was killed as a result (the virus in the warts). The virus, in these cases, had been resistant to traditional medical treatment.   Scientists are calling the compound Hamlet. You can read about this discovery in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Dr. Catharina Svanborg, Prof. Clinical Immunology, Lund University, Sweden, said that this discovery could have relevance for the treatment of cervical cancer. She said the virus found in warts is quite similar to the virus found in cervical cancer.   They plan to carry out a small trial on women who have cervical cancer.   The human papilloma virus comes in many forms – in fact there are at least 130 types of them. In the case of cervical cancer, it is caused by the sexual transmission of two of them.   Millions of people have the virus in their bodies, but not all become ill as a result.   The scientists found that when they applied the breast milk to patients with warts, some of them quite unpleasant ones – plantar warts that attack your feet – they found that the warts shrank by over 75% within three weeks. 75% of the patients got rid of their warts after the second treatment.

       New Scientist   Some dogs can predict when a child will have an epileptic seizure, a new study has revealed. These dogs not only protect their charges from injuries, such as falling, but also seem to help kids deal with the daily struggle of epilepsy.  Nine of the 60 dogs in the study (15 per cent) were able to predict a seizure by licking, whimpering, or standing next to the child. These dogs were remarkably accurate - they predicted 80 per cent of seizures, with no false reports.  However, those interested in owning a dog with these skills cannot yet just order one. The dogs were not trained, but instead began predicting seizures spontaneously within a month of moving in with their owners.  "No one is reliably training such dogs yet," says Adam Kirton, a neurologist at Alberta Children's Hospital in Canada and lead author of the study. His group is looking into setting up a training program. However, some epilepsy patients do have already dogs that have been trained to protect them during a seizure.  Children with epilepsy are at risk of falling or choking during a seizure. The injury rate is highly variable, but can be about 20 per cent for some types of childhood epilepsy.   "But the worst part of the disease isn't a seizure, it's fear of the next seizure," says Kirton. "By knowing when a seizure might happen, it could liberate them and free them to do what they want to do."   Minutes to hours    Before the new study, reports of dogs predicting seizures had only been anecdotal. So Kirton and colleagues attempted to systematically assess dog behaviour by sending questionnaires to families in their clinic.   Forty-two percent of the families with both an epileptic child and a dog said their dogs responded to seizures. And nine of these dogs actually anticipated the seizure, alerting families minutes to hours before the seizure occurred. Also, dog-owning families reported a higher quality of life than those without, with the owners of seizure-alerting dogs reporting the highest values.   One possible weakness of the study is that the behaviour was reported by the dog-owners themselves, who may overestimated their dog's abilities. Kirton therefore plans to do another study in a more clinical setting, which will also try to determine how these dogs predict seizures.   At present, the mechanism is unknown. But some researchers speculate that the dog could be using subtle visual or olfactory cues that occur before a seizure.  Gregory Holmes, a neurologist at Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire, says the dogs could be detecting a change in smell. "People have autonomic changes, such as increased sweating, which a dog could pick up on."  According to Douglas Nordli, director of the children's epilepsy center at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, such external changes could result from a small electrical discharge that occurs in the brain before the full blown electrical seizure.

       News-Medical   Twice as many children are suffering strokes than was previously believed, according to new findings by a Heart and Stroke Foundation and Canadian Stroke Network researcher who is one of Canada’s leading pediatric neurologists.  “We’re seeing double the numbers of stroke in general,” says Dr. Gabrielle deVeber, who will be chairing a session on Stroke in Children and Young Adults today at the 5th World Stroke Congress in Vancouver, B.C. “That’s for both ischemic stroke (blood flow in the brain interrupted by a clot) and haemorrhagic (bleeding into the brain from a ruptured blood vessel). It’s much more common than was previously recognized.”   Until recently, the incidence of both types of paediatric stroke was believed to be two to three per 100,000 children per year. Neurological experts now put the figure at five to six children per 100,000. The Canadian Pediatric Ischemic Stroke Registry, directed by Dr. deVeber since 1992, has found a doubling in the incidence of pediatric stroke over figures previously reported.   While less common than stroke in adults, childhood stroke has a big impact on society. The care required is life-long, over six or seven decades. The burden on the health care system is far greater, along with extra stress on the educational system and productivity lost to society. Dr. deVeber, a neurologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, is working with other neurologists to establish best practices for treating children with stroke.   “Treatments for these children are highly variable,” says Dr. deVeber. “It is very much a patchwork. What treatment a child receives depends on the physician and the hospital. Many children are only diagnosed several days after the beginning of their stroke.”   Dr. deVeber and other Canadian researchers are now leading the first international study of childhood stroke. Directed from the Hospital for Sick Kids, it involves an international registry of childhood stroke centres in the United States and United Kingdom.   “This study will give us the information we are missing: the numbers, stroke types and outcomes,” says Dr. deVeber. “And it will establish a network of investigators to actually do the trials. In order to get the numbers you need, the trials have to be multi-centre and multi-nation, so you have to go to several countries and create a network of investigators. We’re addressing that.”   Dr. Antoine Hakim, CEO and Scientific Director of the Canadian Stroke Network, says more study is needed into the causes of childhood stroke to prevent it from happening and limit the damage when it does. “This disease can rob children of their future and place a heavy burden on the families who must cope with the after-effects of stroke. We need to make sure our children get the best protection from stroke and the best care possible to restore their health.”   Dr. Dean Johnston, neurologist and Heart and Stroke Foundation spokesperson, says too many people believe the myth that stroke affects only seniors. “Stroke does not spare children, teenagers or younger adults. We need to bridge the gap in awareness to ensure children who suffer stroke get immediate care and comprehensive follow-up – everything they need so they can get back to enjoying their childhood.”

       Medical News today   Doctors are failing to identify smoking status in about half of the adolescent patients seen, according to a University of Wisconsin-Madison study. Physicians addressed tobacco use even less with younger teens, missing an opportunity to intervene with those experimenting with tobacco use. Based on an audit of Wisconsin Medicaid medical records, researchers found those least likely to be asked about their smoking status were younger patients, patients who were not pregnant and those from rural areas.   Just 55 percent of adolescent patients seeing a physician in a two-year period were asked about their smoking status and only five percent of patients' charts included smoking status as a vital sign, a government-backed recommendation.   "Previous studies may have overestimated interventions with adolescents because they were based on physician self report," says Tammy Sims, M.D., M.S., the study's lead author from University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center. "Through analysis of patient charts, we have found that physicians are losing a golden opportunity to intervene with current teen smokers and to dissuade potential smokers among the younger teen population."   Information for the study, published in the journal Health Services Research was gleaned from patient charts randomly selected from Wisconsin Medicaid HMO eligibility files from January 1997 to January 1999. The study, focused on individuals 11 to 21 years old, found that tobacco use was documented on 55 percent of patient charts. Of those documented, 35 percent were current tobacco users (99.3 smokers and 0.7 percent smokeless tobacco users), 8 percent were former smokers and 57 percent had never smoked.   This analysis focused on the high-risk, low-income population enrolled in the Medicaid program. Previous research has indicated that individuals with less education and lower incomes are more likely to start smoking and less likely to quit.   "We chose Medicaid recipients because, given the disproportionate burden of illness caused by tobacco use found in lower income groups, we believed it was important to know what interventions they were receiving," says Sims.   The study found that older adolescents were more likely to have their smoking status recorded than younger adolescents. In fact, the odds of having smoking status documented in their charts increased by 21 percent for every one-year increase in the patient's age. Smoking status was less likely to be recorded in charts of patients from rural areas. Patients in urban or suburban areas were almost twice as likely as rural patients to have smoking status recorded.   "We also saw a failure to address tobacco status at more than one visit," Sims says. "This coupled with their reluctance to ask younger adolescents about smoking status means that physicians were unlikely to identify early experimenters--another missed opportunity."   Pregnant patients fared better than those who were not pregnant-the charts of pregnant patients were almost 10 times more likely to have tobacco use documented than non-pregnant patients. One explanation, in addition to the greater risks associated with smoking during pregnancy, is that prenatal forms such as those from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) include reminders prompting a physician to address and document tobacco use in the patient's medical record.   The treatment picture is also somewhat better. Eighty percent of patients who said they had ever used tobacco had a detailed history of their tobacco use recorded in their medical record. Chart records indicated that 50 percent of teen smokers received physician advice to quit and were offered assistance. Counseling was the most common form of assistance offered. No prescriptions for nicotine replacement therapy were documented. Of those offered assistance, 39 percent had follow-up arranged.   However, this was only 16 percent of identified smokers.   In terms of exposure to second-hand smoke, only five percent of charts had documentation about this risk. Second-hand smoke was four times more likely to be documented for pregnant patients than non-pregnant ones.   Researchers acknowledge that a gap may exist between what a physician discusses during an office visit and what is written in the patient's medical record. However, paper documentation is vital for reimbursement of services as well as for quality control and medical-legal reasons.   The University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center (TTURC) is one of seven centers funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Drug Abuse to investigate new ways of combating tobacco use and nicotine addiction, using an innovative, integrated approach. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also funds the TTURCs at these institutions through the Partners with   Tobacco Use Research Centers program. The Partners program supplements the TTURC research by supporting tobacco-related policy research and communications activities.

       BBC News    A leading children's charity has claimed that many families in Scotland are unable to afford a healthy diet.   NCH has published research showing that one in five of all parents say lack of money sometimes makes it impossible to feed their children properly.   Researchers found that almost half of parents on a low income said they had had to go hungry in the past year.   The charity claims a typical basket of healthy food costs 17% more than a basket of unhealthy food.    Fresh fruit   The Going Hungry report, a snapshot of low-income families from across the UK, said the situation was getting worse.   The price of convenience food is going up more slowly than items such as fresh fruit.   Over the last 15 years, the average cost of a healthy shopping basket has increased by half, compared to only a 33% increase for an unhealthy basket.   According to the report, a quarter of children never eat green vegetables or salad.   NCH is calling on the government to pay much greater attention to the impact of poverty on children's diets.   David Turnbull, director of the charity in Scotland, told BBC Radio Scotland that the research highlighted a continuing problem for a small group of people on the lowest incomes.   He said: "In many respects the government's policy of moving people into work and out of poverty is a solid one, but it does mean that those on the lowest income are under the most pressure.   "Healthy food costs more and people sometimes have to go for the cheapest option. It's a vicious circle that people are caught in.   "A lot of people live away from out-of-town food retailers and have to depend on local shops where prices are higher, so they are paying an added premium.   "Basically the poorest people have to pay the most for their food."   'Action needed'   Christopher Holmes, director of children's services for NCH Scotland, added: "It is right to be concerned about rising levels of childhood obesity - but NCH's new report shows that it's unfair to place all the blame on parents and children.   "The comparatively high cost of healthy food and sophisticated marketing used to encourage children to eat junk food are also significant factors.  "Going Hungry shows that the government needs to do much, much more if it is to put healthy food within the reach of children.   "Action is needed in schools, in the community and within the food industry. Most of all, the government must make healthy food affordable to low-income families.   "Otherwise, drives to end child poverty and improve the nation's health are set to fail."   National action plan   NCH is calling on food retailers and manufacturers to reduce salt, sugar and fat levels in food for children, improve labelling, remove snacks from supermarket checkouts and only promote healthy food.   The charity also wants the government to develop a national action plan to stamp out food poverty.   Scottish Socialist Party MSP Frances Curran said: "This report is a damning indictment of the poverty and inequality that exists in 2004 in a wealthy country like Scotland.   "It also spotlights the disgusting hypocrisy of well-fed Scottish Executive ministers such as Frank McAveety, who earns £70,000-plus a year, benefit from a subsidised parliamentary canteen providing fresh, healthy food at knock-down prices, while thousands of children live on a diet of cheap, high-fat, high-salt convenience foods."

       BBC News    Over 80% of doctors have seen colleagues make mistakes or had concerns about the care being provided, a survey suggests.    But Doctors.net.uk found only 15% of incidents which could have led to death or disability were reported.   The National Patient Safety Agency is rolling out an anonymous reporting system across the NHS this year.   But the majority of the 2,500 doctors surveyed backed an independent internet site to log such errors.   Blame culture   Of those questioned, 81% said they did not trust their NHS Trust or the Department of Health to a run a blame-free system for reporting their mistakes.   Dr Neil Bacon, founder of Doctors.net.uk, said: "Existing systems are not trusted by doctors.   "It's meant to be confidential but the culture of no blame isn't a reality in the NHS. It's used as a witch-hunt.   "At the moment we have no way of learning as doctors from each other. Effectively, we are all working in the dark."   Dr Bacon said the only way forward was an anonymous system like those used by airline pilots.   This could be a confidential system on the Internet, he said.   "Doctors want this to change. It isn't doctors being secretive," said Dr Bacon.   He said errors reported ranged from small, day in day out mistakes in prescribing and diagnosing to rare but much more serious mistakes.   "Doctors across the UK have shown a remarkable honesty and frankness about the scale of the problem and a demand that things change for the benefit of their patients," he said.   Time for change   Sue Osborn, Joint Chief Executive of the National Patient Safety Agency which is introducing the NHS's reporting system said: "If we want to maximise the numbers of reports we receive and the amount we learn, we need the trust of clinicians.   "This is why we have developed an anonymous system that will respect the confidentiality of those who take the time to report to us," he said.   Michael Wilks, chairman of the British Medical Association's Medico-Legal Committee, said: "The BMA would welcome a system of reporting that allows clinical mistakes to be openly discussed and analysed.   He said: "Many medical mistakes are a result of system errors rather than the negligence of an individual doctor and so any system that helps prevent medical mistakes, by helping doctors come forward without the fear of being blamed, would hold real benefits for the NHS.   "E-learning systems that allows for reporting medical mistakes should be introduced as part of the planned reform of the clinical negligence system if it is to effectively tackle the blame culture within the NHS," he said.   The Royal College of Nursing released new guidelines last week aimed at cutting blood transfusion errors.   It sets out practical step-by-step advice for nurses involved in the transfusion process.   Figures from the Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting scheme show a 47% increase in reporting of adverse events and near misses since 1996.

       Swissinfo    If you want to pass an exam, you should get a good night’s sleep beforehand, a Swiss researcher has found.   A study carried out by Reto Huber and published in the science journal, “Nature”, shows that the brain processes and consolidates newly learned matter during deep sleep.  He found that as soon as deep sleep sets in, the brain cells start to work in harmony, generating regular, low-frequency brainwaves.  Huber’s findings have shed new light on this type of brain activity, which has puzzled scientists until now.  He told swissinfo that while many previous studies had shown that sleep helps people perform certain tasks better, it was unclear why.  “Our study is probably one of the first to show that the slow brainwaves occurring during deep sleep are responsible for learning improvement,” said Huber.  “It provides for the first time a mechanism for how this learning occurs during sleep.”   Active brain   Huber and his co-researchers at the University of Wisconsin set 12 subjects a special learning task, and then measured their brain activity during sleep.  They monitored particular activity in an area already known from other scientific studies to be involved in the learning process.  “We found in a very small area [of the brain] increased intensity of these very slow brainwaves which dominate our sleep,” reported Huber  “Furthermore, we found that the larger the increase in the brainwaves during sleep, the more subjects improved on the learning task the next morning.”   Further tests   Huber told swissinfo that the study, conducted among young males, would be followed up by further tests on how activity – or lack of activity – influences sleep.  Studies are to be carried out to check the relationship between learning and deep sleep among other subject groups.  “What we are doing right now is looking at immobilisation to see if that has any influence on sleep. So it’s quite the opposite of our other study where subjects were actively doing something,” said Huber.  “[Our studies] might provide indications as to how we can treat or help people with learning or with sleep problems.”  Huber’s research was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin in the United States, where he is based.

       News-Medical    Here is the latest treatment for people with chronic heart failure: a nurse draws blood from the patient, runs that blood through a machine, superheating and “stressing” the blood, and then, injects it back into the patient.    It sounds like science fiction – and too simple to be true. But that is exactly what cardiologists at the University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine are doing in a clinical trial launched today.  The ACCLAIM study is a double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling 2000 people with chronic heart failure across North America. Clinical research sites include Sacramento, Montreal, Dallas, Cleveland, Boston, and Calgary.  “We cardiologists have recently come to understand that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of heart failure,” says Dr. Debra Isaac, associate clinical professor of cardiology, U of C Faculty of Medicine. “This procedure targets chronic inflammation by kick-starting the immune system’s own anti-inflammatory response.”  The procedure, known as immune modulation therapy, involves the following: a nurse takes 10 cc’s (about 2 teaspoons) of blood from a patient, and puts that blood into a specialized machine that applies stresses: heat, oxidation, and UV light. When white blood cells experience this stress, they begin to die. The nurse then re-injects that blood back into the patient’s leg muscle. The dying cells trigger an anti-inflammatory reaction in the patient, inducing his/her body to boost its own anti-inflammatory processes.  “It is critical that we slow down the inflammatory process that is toxic to the heart,” says Dr. Jean Rouleau, dean, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, and principal investigator of the study for Canada. “Our hope is that this potential treatment can alleviate the serious side-effects of chronic heart failure, and treat the long-term damage being caused by the disease.”  Phase 2 clinical trials found that this procedure was beneficial to a significant number of patients, resulting in fewer hospitalizations, better quality of life, improved clinical status, and fewer deaths due to the devastating effects of heart failure.  Dr. Isaac, principal investigator of ACCLAIM in Calgary, and director, cardiac transplantation program, Calgary Health Region, is aiming to recruit 30 people who will undergo the 20-minute procedure on an outpatient basis once a month for 2 years.

       BBC NEWS    Changes in the daily pattern of a hormone which controls hunger could explain why some people become obese, US scientists have claimed   A University of California study looked at levels of the hormone ghrelin in five lean and five obese men.   Researchers found the ghrelin levels of lean men peaked during the night but in obese men it rose most during the day.   This meant obese men were more likely to eat, they told the Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences.   Mealtime peaks   Ghrelin is made by cells in the stomach and is the only known hormone that stimulates hunger. Its levels go up before meals and fall again after eating.   Dr Julio Licinio's team looked at the ghrelin levels of five lean and five obese young men.   They took blood from the men every seven minutes over 24 hours.   The lean men had a large increase in ghrelin levels between midnight and 6am.   This was larger than the spikes of ghrelin seen before meals.   In comparison, the obese men had no night-time peak and had overall lower levels of ghrelin.   Dr Licinio said at first glance their findings appeared to be contradictory.   "You'd expect the blood levels of the heavier men to contain more hunger hormone. Something must be overriding obese persons' ghrelin," he said.   "The most powerful ghrelin surge was missing in the obese men, suggesting that their regulatory system has gone awry or is no longer able to listen to its own cues," he said.   For the obese men, the predominant rises in ghrelin were during the day when they were awake and able to eat.   Dr Licinio's team also measured the men's blood levels of two hormones produced by fat cells - leptin and adiponectin. Leptin tells the body when it is full and adiponectin helps regulate energy.   The overweight men had higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin than the lean men but, unlike ghrelin, the hormones followed the same fluctuations in both groups.   Over-eating   Dr Licinio said the findings defied the stereotype of overweight people waking up in the middle of the night to raid the refrigerator.   "The men in our study slept through the night and both groups ate meals designed to maintain their current weight," he said.   "For someone to gain weight and become obese they must eat a lot. So this could help explain why obese people eat more during the day. Ghrelin is stimulating appetite during the day," he said.   He added that it might be possible to treat obesity by targeting ghrelin.   "We must try to solve this mystery and explore new drugs to make them more sensitive to their bodies' internal cues.   "Our next step is to see what's happening during weight gain and weight loss," he said.   National Obesity Forum chairman Dr David Haslam said: "It's very interesting and there is a certain degree of potential there but in practical terms we need to see a lot more research on a lot greater population of people.   "If and when that happens we will welcome it with open arms as a potential weapon against obesity," he said.

       CBC News   CHICAGO - An extract of prickly pear cactus may help prevent hangover symptoms such as dry mouth and nausea, scientists have found.   Unlike folk remedies like eating a greasy breakfast, the extract seems to help forestall symptoms rather than relieve them.   Dr. Jeff Wiese of Tulane University in New Orleans and his colleagues randomly assigned 55 young adults to either take the extract or a placebo.   All of the volunteers then ate a fast-food dinner. Four hours later, they started drinking either:   Vodka.   Gin.    Rum.    Bourbon.    Scotch.    Tequila.  The volunteers, aged 21 to 35, drank up to 1.75 grams of alcohol per kilogram of body mass, an amount that produced hangovers in previous studies.   Drunken study participants were driven home. The next morning, they ranked nine symptoms of hangover severity. A week later, the experiment was repeated with the two groups trading places.   The extract showed statistically significant improvements in nausea, lack of appetite, and dry mouth but Wiese's team did not measure if it helped the foggy-headed feeling common in hangover sufferers.   "In this randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we found hangover symptom severity to be moderately reduced by an extract of the prickly pear plant, Opuntia ficus indica," the researchers wrote in Monday's issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.   The researchers also measured levels of C-reactive protein, which is thought to be involved in inflammation and hangovers.   They found those who took the extract had 40 per cent less C-reactive protein in their bloodstreams compared to those who took a placebo.   The research was funded by the U.S. government and a nutritional supplement company that markets a form of the extract.

       New Scientist   A plant banned as an illegal drug in some countries could help boost men’s fertility, say UK researchers.   The leaves of khat, a plant cultivated in East Africa and the Arabian peninsula, contain a chemical that peps up sperm and increase their chances of fertilizing an egg. The researchers suggest the chemical could one day be produced as an over-the-counter treatment for couples experiencing problems conceiving.  Khat (Catha edulis) has been known for centuries for the euphoria its leaves induce when chewed. The stimulant, cathinone, is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and norephedrine. These belong to a group of chemicals called PPAs, which are similar to amphetamines and adrenaline.  Lynn Fraser and her team at the Centre for Reproduction, Endocrinology and Diabetes at King’s College in London, UK, decided to test the effects of PPAs on sperm. They were studying the final stage of sperm development called capacitation, where sperm "switch on" and develop the ability to fertilise an egg.   Accelerated effect    The team placed mouse sperm in four different PPA compounds: cathine, norephedrine, adrenaline and noradrenaline and tested to see how they affected capacitation. All four accelerated capacitation even at low concentrations.   The team also tested the effects of cathine on human sperm, with similar results. This means that cathine can pep up a man’s sperm, increasing the number able to fertilise an egg.  The team then tested the effects of PPAs on the final stage of capacitation where the sperm’s head pops open and releases the enzymes it needs to burrow into the egg.   This "acrosome reaction" is triggered by chemicals produced by the egg, but can also happen spontaneously. Fraser’s team found that cathine prevented this spontaneous reaction, but did not affect the reaction prompted by the egg.  So cathine can both turn sperm on and stop them peaking too early, maximising the chances of fertilisation. But Fraser says: “I certainly wouldn’t advocate anyone going out and chewing khat leaves.” A consistent, measured dose, as would be found in a commercially-prepared drug, would be preferable, she says.   Undiagnosed problems   Many men experiencing fertility problems have normal sperm counts. The cause may be undiagnosed problems with sperm function, explained Fraser, but no-one knows how prevalent this problem is. A drug based on cathine might help.  “We are not suggesting that this would be a panacea for infertile couples,” she told New Scientist. However, couples trying to conceive often take steps to improve their chances by altering their lifestyles, such as stopping smoking, she added.   Taking an over-the-counter drug containing compounds such as cathine could just be an extension of this, especially if conception were taking longer than expected. “Anything that reduces the need to go for assisted reproduction would be valuable,” said Fraser.  The research was presented on Monday at the 20th conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Berlin, Germany.

       BBC NEWS    Women undergoing IVF treatment should have just one embryo implanted instead of two, researchers have said.  Scandinavian researchers told the European Fertility Conference in Berlin single embryos give women virtually the same chance of becoming pregnant.    They said it meant woman and babies would avoid the risks associated with multiple births.   But the UK's fertility authority said more evidence was needed before it could recommend use of just one embryo.   Over 660 patients were studied in the Scandinavian research, which took place in centres in Sweden, Norway, Denmark.   All the women were under 36 years of age, and undergoing a first or second IVF cycle, and had at least two good quality embryos available for transfer or freezing.   They either had two embryos implanted, or one embryo implanted and one frozen for use in a second cycle if there was no live birth from the first.   'Standard treatment'   The pregnancy rate among those given single embryos was 39.7%, compared to 43.5% in the double embryo group.   Ninety one of the single-embryo women became pregnant after their first cycle of treatment. Another 29 became pregnant after the second.   In the double embryo group, 142 women became pregnant.   Dr Ann Thurin of Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden, who led the study, told BBC News Online: "You get the same live births [from single embryo transfers], but you don't have the multiple births, which is the main problem."   Multiple births tend to lead to smaller babies, and a higher risk of health problems for both the babies and their mother.   She said she would recommend all European countries introduced the single embryo transfer as standard for women in this group - under 36, in their first or second cycles who have good quality embryos.   The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which regulates fertility treatment in the UK, ruled earlier this year that a maximum of two embryos should be implanted in each cycle of treatment.   A spokeswoman said: "One of the reasons the HFEA is at this conference is to look at the evidence that comes from other countries."   But she said more evidence was needed before the HFEA recommended a move to single embryo transfer.   "We have stated that we would like to move to single embryo transfer, but we don't want to do that if it's going to disadvantage anyone.   "If there was an age limit, we would have to get it right."

       News-Medical    People who have high blood pressure are highly likely to also have untreated or insufficiently treated cholesterol problems that significantly increase their risk for heart attack and stroke, according to findings of a Mayo Clinic-led study published this week in Archives of Internal Medicine.   “This points out both a serious problem and a significant opportunity to prevent disease of the heart and blood vessels,” says Stephen Turner, M.D., the Mayo Clinic hypertension specialist who led the study. “Nearly 50 million U.S. adults have hypertension. Our study suggests that more than two-thirds of them also have high cholesterol that likely is not being treated aggressively enough. This double whammy has enormous implications for disease prevention.”  The findings come from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. Investigators studied two hypertensive populations: 1,070 non-Hispanic whites from Rochester, Minn., and 1,286 non-Hispanic blacks from Jackson, Miss. About one-half of the blacks with high blood pressure (49.5 percent of women and 56.7 percent of men) also had high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia). More than three-fourths (78.4 percent) of the white male hypertensives - and 64.7 percent of the women - had hyperlipidemia. Among study subjects with both risk factors, fewer than one out of three were taking cholesterol-lowering medications (primarily statins), and less than one-half of those had reached recommended lipid levels. Whites were more likely than blacks and white men were more likely than white women to be taking lipid-lowering medications, but this did not translate into statistically better control of cholesterol problems.  Dr. Turner says patients who have hypertension should have their cholesterol checked, and should treat both problems aggressively. “High blood pressure and high cholesterol are two of the most important risk factors for heart attack and stroke,” says Dr. Turner. “Having both doesn’t just add to your risk of cardiovascular disease - it multiplies the risk. And if you have high blood pressure, our study suggests you are likely to have lipid abnormalities.  “But unlike sex or family history, these risk factors can be modified. Because nine out of ten people who have both hypertension and dyslipidemia are now receiving either no treatment or inadequate treatment for their cholesterol problems, we can significantly improve the health outlook for these individuals and for our society by simply applying the therapies we already have,” Dr. Turner concludes.  Co-authors of the paper, “Ethnic and Sex Differences in the Prevalence, Treatment, and Control of Dyslipidemia Among Hypertensive Adults in the GENOA Study,” include John O’Meara, Pharm.D., Jeffrey Armon, Pharm.D., and Dr. Turner from Mayo Clinic; Sharon Kardia, Ph.D., from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; C. Andrew Brown, M.D., from the University of Mississippi, Jackson; and Eric Boerwinkle, Ph.D., from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

       BBC News    The latest endorsement for using blood-sucking leeches for medical purposes has come from the US government.    In a world where medical advances are dominated by developments in drugs and surgery it seems that in certain fields these humble creatures cannot be beaten.   They are highly prized as a tool for healing skin grafts or restoring circulation, especially in reconstructive surgery.   Now the US Food and Drug Administration has approved an application from French firm Ricarimpex SAS to market leeches for medicinal purposes.   These hungry little Draculas have been used in medicine for centuries and were first employed in Egypt about 2,500 years ago.   Later, they were applied to treat all kinds of ailments from headaches to gout.   Through bloodletting, it was thought that leeches would drain "impure blood" from the body, thereby curing illness.   Eventually, scientific research showed that leeches were unlikely to stop a headache, but are useful in surgery.   They are often used today in plastic and reconstructive surgery, because a natural anticoagulant they secrete fights blood clots and restores proper blood flow to inflamed parts of the body.   Thousands of patients owe the successful reattachment of body parts to miraculous technological advances in plastic and reconstructive surgery.   But some of these operations might have failed if leeches had not been reintroduced into the operating room.   The appendages reattached include fingers, hands, toes, legs, ears, noses and nipples following breast reconstructive surgery.   Buying time   During operations, micro surgeons usually have little trouble attaching the two ends of the arteries, because arteries are thick-walled and relatively easy to suture.   Veins, however, are thin-walled and especially difficult to suture, particularly if the tissue is badly damaged.   All too often the surgeon can get blood to flow in the reattached arteries but not veins.   With the venous circulation severely compromised, the blood going to the reattached finger becomes congested, or stagnant; the reattached portion turns blue and lifeless and is at serious risk of being lost.   It is in these cases that leeches are summoned.   Ken Dunn, consultant burns and plastic surgeon at the South Manchester Burns and Plastic Surgery Service said: "We use leeches to establish a flow of blood through tissue where there is congestion of blood, usually because the flow of venous blood out is not adequate, while the arterial flow of blood into the tissue is good or excellent.   "The treatment simply buys time for the venous drainage to open up and improve, usually 3-5 days. If this is not done the tissue will die from that congestion of blood.   "Leeches are extremely effective and better than simply putting a hole in the tissue to make it bleed because the leech lines the bite they make with a good anticoagulant that is very long lasting.   "On average the tissue bleeds about 10 times the volume of blood that the leech actually removes to feed on, making it a very efficient and effective treatment.   "Treatment with a single leech will last hours and allow blood flow in the tissue during that time."   Natural anaesthetic   The key to success is the exploitation of a unique property of the leech bite, namely, the creation of a puncture wound that bleeds literally for hours.   The leech's saliva contains substances that anaesthetise the wound area, dilate the blood vessels to increase blood flow and prevent the blood from clotting.   Mr Dunn said: "Leeches are a treatment associated with medieval times and appear a tad dated.   "However, much the same as maggots and a small list of other treatments, leeches still have their place in modern medicine."   They do have their drawbacks, one of which is the patients' squeamishness about having three-inch slimy parasites attached to their wounds.   They can sometimes slip off patients and reattach themselves to other parts of the body not in need of therapy.   However if you are ever in that unfortunate position of needing leech therapy, it may be a case of lie back and think of something more attractive if it means saving a limb.

       Reuters   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Using artificial sweeteners may throw off our ability to monitor how many calories we consume, new animal research suggests.  Rats that had been fed an artificially sweetened diet tended to overeat when given naturally sweetened high-calorie food compared with rats that had never consumed artificial sweeteners.  Researchers also found that the thickness of a sweetened drink seems to interfere with rats' abilities to keep their calorie consumption under control.  The results are preliminary, but they raise the possibility that artificially sweetened foods and high-calorie beverages may interfere with the ability to keep calorie consumption under control, one of the study's authors told Reuters Health.  "We propose that humans and other animals use sweetness and viscosity to help estimate the caloric content of the foods they eat, with sweeter and thicker foods signaling more calories and less sweet and thinner foods signaling fewer calories," said Dr. Terry L. Davidson of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Along with Purdue co-author Dr. Susan E. Swithers, Davidson hypothesized that consuming foods and beverages that are either low-calorie but very sweet or high-calorie but very thin may interfere with the ability to rely on taste and thickness to regulate caloric intake.  "The data presented in our paper suggest that such interference increases the tendency to overeat and gain weight in rats," Davidson said.  Davidson explained that one way that people and other animals are thought to control their weight is by reducing the amount of food they eat on some occasions to compensate for pigging out at other times.  "I think many people who now struggle to keep off extra pounds remember a time when they could perform this type of compensation almost effortlessly, without consciously trying to watch and control their caloric intake," Davidson said.  The Purdue researcher said he doubts that there is a single explanation for the diminished ability to control calories without much conscious reckoning. But it is possible that certain foods that have become popular in recent years may play at least some part, he said.  For instance, the number of Americans who consume sugar-free products has risen from less than 70 million in 1987 to more than 160 million in 2000, Davidson and Swithers note in a report in the International Journal of Obesity. Consumption of high-calorie soft drinks has also surged during the past few decades.  The researchers conducted two rat studies to evaluate the impact of artificial sweeteners and high-calorie drinks on calorie consumption.  In the first, one group of rats was fed a naturally sweetened liquid while another group was given an artificially sweetened liquid. After consuming the sweet drink for more than a week, the rats were offered a high-calorie, sweet chocolate treat before having a meal of normal rat chow.  Rats that were used to drinking the naturally sweetened liquid compensated for the pre-meal snack by eating less rat chow. But the rats accustomed to the artificially sweetened liquid ate more rat chow, suggesting that they were less adept at figuring out how many calories they should eat.  In the second study, rats were given a high-calorie dietary supplement that had the consistency of either chocolate milk or chocolate pudding. Even though the thick and thin supplements had the same amount of calories, rats given the thin one consumed more and gained more weight during the study.  "Our preliminary research indicates that the effects of consuming certain types of processed foods on longer-term caloric intake and body weight deserve additional study," Davidson said. Future studies should try to determine to what extent people normally use taste and viscosity to gauge calories, he said.

       BBC News    Scientists have shown how the brain can be fooled into feeling sensations in a fake limb.  They recorded changes in brain activity during an experiment in which volunteers were made to think a rubber hand was their own limb.    The University College London team hope their work will shed light on self-perception disorders such as schizophrenia and stroke.   Their work is published in Science Express Online.   In the study, funded by the Wellcome Trust, volunteers hid their right hand under a table and a rubber hand was put in front of them at an angle to make it look like part of their body.   The rubber hand and hidden real hand were stroked simultaneously with a paintbrush while the volunteer's brain was scanned using magnetic resonance imaging.   It took just 11 seconds for volunteers to start feeling the rubber hand was their own.   The stronger the feeling, the greater the activity recorded in the brain.   Volunteers were later asked to point towards their right hand. Most pointed towards the rubber hand instead of the real one, showing how the brain had readjusted.   The researchers found one area of the brain, called the premotor cortex, recognises the body by accepting information from three different senses - vision, touch and proprioception (position sense).   Mixed messages   But if there are inconsistencies, the brain "believes" visual information as it is the strongest sense.   Lead researcher Dr Henrik Ehrsson said: "The feeling that our bodies belong to ourselves is a fundamental part of human consciousness, yet there are surprisingly few studies of awareness of one's own body.   "Distinguishing oneself from the environment is a critical, everyday problem that has to be solved by the central nervous system of all animals.   "If the distinction fails, the animal might try to feed on itself and will not be able to plan actions that involve both body parts and external objects, such as a monkey reaching for a banana.   "This study shows that the brain distinguishes the self from the non-self by comparing information from the different senses. In a way you could argue that the bodily self is an illusion being constructed in the brain."   Disorders such as schizophrenia and stroke often involve impaired self-perception where, for example, a woman might try to throw her left leg out of bed every morning because she believes the leg belongs to someone else.   Misidentification or unawareness of a limb arising from damage to the premotor cortex from a stroke is not uncommon.   Phantom limb syndrome is a disorder which can arise after amputation.   Remedies that trick the brain into believing the limb has been replaced, for example by using a mirror to reflect the opposite healthy limb onto the amputated limb, exploit the brain's mechanism of self-perception.   Greg Vines, spokesman for the Stroke Association, welcomed the research.   He said: "It's a great step forward. We want to look at widening research out and testing on more cases and developing rehabilitation services to help make people more aware of spatial perception."

       Tronto Star   Tough day at work? If you're a woman, that might mean you'll hit the potato chips and chocolate when you get home, according to the Journal Of Applied Social Psychology.  It's not news that people often eat to relieve stress. But a study found that even after the stress was over, women who were more frustrated by it ate more fatty foods than those who were not as frustrated.  However, men's snack preferences stayed the same, regardless of their stress levels.  Participants in the study were asked to do office tasks while being blasted with 108 decibels of office noise, the same noise level you would get standing next to a jackhammer. Then they were offered a chance to relax — and a tray of snacks, including fatty cheese, potato chips and white chocolate, and low-fat popcorn, pretzels and jelly beans.  After they had snacked, they were asked to trace their way through an unsolvable maze.  Those women whose stress level was the highest — their blood pressure and heart rate remained high and they were frustrated by the maze — tended to eschew the low-fat snacks in favour of fattier treats.  Why did the women eat more fatty snacks than the men?  Men and women handle stress differently, suggests William Kelley, director of the Wellness Center at Green Mountain College in Vermont. "Men that I usually see are sort of, `It happened, it's over, let's deal with it and move on' ... women tend to struggle more with the processing time of an event afterward. I'm not sure if that's genetic programming or society."

       The Globe and Mail   People with asthma are 12 times as likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as those who do not have asthma, according to a new study.  While the two respiratory diseases share symptoms, they have always been considered distinct. But new research suggests that asthma and COPD "may share a common background" and asthma may lay the groundwork for the far more serious condition, said Graciela Silva, a researcher at the Respiratory Centre of the University of Arizona in Tucson.  She said factors such as smoking and pollution may facilitate the evolution of asthma into COPD, and that means asthmatics should be particularly careful about their exposure to tobacco smoke and pollutants.  COPD is the name of a group of chronic lung diseases, including severe forms of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It is characterized by severe breathing problems and permanent lung damage. Asthma is not believed to cause permanent lung damage, and symptoms dissipate spontaneously or with medication.   The findings, published in the medical journal Chest, are the result of a two-decade study of more than 3,000 Arizona residents.  At the outset, participants were assessed for asthma, allergies and smoking status. Almost 200 had asthma, but none had COPD.  After 20 years, the participants with asthma were far more likely to have developed more serious conditions: They were 10 times more likely to have bronchitis; 17 times more likely to have emphysema; and 12 times more likely to have COPD. (Patients can have bronchitis or emphysema without it having progressed to COPD.)  Notably, the research did not find an association between childhood asthma and COPD later in life. Dr. Silva said this suggests that actively treating asthma may reduce the risk of COPD. But she stressed that more research is needed to determine how asthma progresses to COPD.  Smoking is one clearly established risk factor. Virtually everyone who develops COPD is a smoker. That proved to be true in the study, though researchers noted that less than 20 per cent of smokers developed chronic obstructive lung disease.  "Although most people living with COPD have a history of smoking, the majority of smokers do not develop COPD later in life, suggesting that other factors, such as genetic, occupational or environmental conditions convey significant risk," Dr. Silva said.  Research published in June in the medical journal Clinics of Chest Medicine shows that women are far more susceptible to COPD than men.   What that means, practically speaking, is that women suffer far more lung damage than men do smoking the same number of cigarettes, said Kenneth Chapman, a physician at the Asthma and Airway Centre at Toronto Western Hospital.  He said this is likely due to the fact that women have smaller airways as COPD is essentially a permanent narrowing of the breathing tubes.  COPD is the fifth leading cause of death in Canada, and the only disease in the top five whose prevalence is increasing.  Canadian data show that 3.6 per cent of women 35 or older suffer from COPD, compared with 2.8 per cent of men.  Worldwide, more than three million people die annually of COPD.

       New York Times   Ultraviolet rays can make the time spent on a tanning bed more pleasurable, a study has found. "These people are getting their little hit of UV," one researcher said.  This time of year dermatologists are wringing their pale, smooth hands in dismay and frustration: Why don't people listen to the warnings about the risks of sunlight?  Vanity and the recklessness of the young usually get the blame.  But maybe there's more to the urge to bake than looks and youthful abandon. A small, provocative study seems to say so. It links the penetration of ultraviolet rays to the release of pleasure-inducing endorphins in the brain.   Writing in The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, a group of researchers reported that they sought out volunteers who regularly went to tanning salons and invited them to lounge in tanning beds at no charge over a period of six weeks.  The 14 volunteers - 13 women and a man - came in twice a week and were directed to one of two seemingly identical tanning beds. But one of the beds was equipped with a UV filter and the other wasn't.  When the volunteers were given mood assessments afterwards, those who had not been shielded from the ultraviolet light consistently seemed more content and more relaxed. And when the group was given the opportunity to come in on a third day and choose one bed or the other, 11 of the 12 people headed straight for the bed that provided ultraviolet light.  The researchers liken that response to the persistence of other risky behaviors, like smoking and drug use. They note that tanning salons are increasingly popular - their use tripled from 1986 to 1996 - and point to a survey of college-age tanning-bed users who often said that their love of sunbathing was enhanced by the sense of well-being it produced.  The lead author of the study, Dr. Steven R. Feldman, professor of dermatology, pathology and public health sciences at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., said: "They're lying out on their backs and they're saying, 'Ah, this feels so good.' These people are getting their little hit of UV."

       Forbes   MONDAY, July 12 (HealthDayNews) -- Ever feel like your heart is racing or beating erratically? The culprit could be an underlying sleep problem.   A new study adds to increasing evidence linking atrial fibrillation with sleep apnea. People diagnosed with the abnormal heart rhythm were twice as likely to have the sleeping disorder as general heart patients, researchers report in the July 13 online issue of the journal Circulation.  While the study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, it does suggest that obstructive sleep apnea -- when breathing stops repeatedly during sleep -- predisposes people to the heart rhythm abnormality.   "The bottom line is that if you have atrial fibrillation, at least consider the possibility that there may be underlying sleep apnea," said Dr. Virend K. Somers, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic's Division of Cardiovascular Diseases and a senior author of the study.   The study is believed to be the first to examine the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in people with sleep apnea. That information could have significant implications for screening and treating patients with atrial fibrillation.   Dr. Meir Kryger, a Canadian sleep disorders specialist and member of the board of directors of the National Sleep Foundation, said the findings suggest that cardiologists need to begin asking their patients about symptoms of sleep apnea. In addition, the study points to the need for greater collaboration between cardiologists and sleep specialists.   "There are very, very few cardiologists around who are actually involved in sleep research," he said. "Hopefully this trend is going to change."  Cardiac arrhythmia, the term used to describe an abnormal heart rhythm, is the result of a change in the normal sequence of electrical impulses that stimulate the heart. In the case of atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, the upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of contracting. Since blood isn't pumped out completely, it can pool, leaving the risk of clotting.   The condition affects about 2 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association, but research suggests that the number will exceed 5 million by 2050.   Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissue at the back of the throat collapses and closes during sleep. People with this condition literally stop breathing, sometimes hundreds of times during the night for periods ranging from 10 seconds to more than one minute.   An estimated 18 million Americans may have sleep apnea, according to the National Sleep Foundation.   Both atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea share certain links with cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and coronary heart disease. Being male or obese also are risk factors for each condition, experts say.   "What's interesting about [the study] is something that's been evolving in the last two to three years -- the notion that there's a huge link between cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea," said Kryger, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg and a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba.   The Mayo study involved 151 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and 312 general cardiology patients. People in each group completed questionnaires about their snoring, daytime sleepiness, body mass index, and hypertension to identify risk for sleep apnea.   Almost half of the atrial fibrillation patients were deemed to be at high risk for sleep apnea, compared with a third of general cardiology patients, or 49 percent vs. 32 percent.   The association of sleep apnea with heart arrhythmia was greater than the association of sleep apnea with its traditional risk factors, such as body mass index, neck circumference, and hypertension, the authors noted.   Overall, patients with atrial fibrillation were more than twice as likely as general heart patients to have sleep apnea.   Why the strong connection? When sleep apnea interrupts breathing, oxygen in the blood drops and carbon dioxide increases. The body's "fight-or-flight" response is activated. And the struggle to breathe may result in dramatic shifts in pressure across the heart chambers. These reactions, if left untreated over time, may predispose someone to atrial fibrillation, the authors suggest.   A Mayo Clinic study reported last year showed that the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation is doubled in people with untreated sleep apnea. The new study shows just how widespread sleep apnea is among patients with that heart arrhythmia.   "I think the evidence that's coming out slowly from our lab and from other laboratories is beginning to sensitize people to this link," Somers said.

       Medical News Today   Dietary niacin (vitamin B3 ) may protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease and the cognitive decline associated with ageing in older people, suggests research in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.  Rich sources of niacin include lean meat, fish, legumes, nuts, dairy products, enriched grains and cereals, and coffee and tea.  [Dietary niacin and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease and of cognitive decline J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2004; 75: 1093-99]  The researchers base their findings on almost 4000 people aged 65 and older, who had no Alzheimer's disease. These participants completed a dietary questionnaire and were checked for any signs of decreasing mental agility (cognitive decline) three and six years after the start of the study.  At three years, a random sample of 815 people, who had not initially had Alzheimer's disease, were checked for clinical changes and their dietary niacin intake assessed by means of food frequency questionnaires.  Among this smaller group, 131 people were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After adjusting the results for age, gender, race, educational levels, and the ApoE gene - all important risk factors for the disease - those with the lowest food intake of niacin (an average of 12.6 mg/day) were 80% more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than those with the highest intake (22.4 mg/day).   An analysis of the larger group showed that the rate of cognitive decline among those with the highest niacin intake was almost half (44%) that of those with the lowest intake.   Niacin has been prescribed to older people to prevent confusional states, and severe deficiency causes pellagra, a condition characterised by dementia, diarrhoea, and dermatitis, but its role in Alzheimer's disease has not been thoroughly explored, say the authors.   Previous research has indicated that niacin has an important role in DNA synthesis and repair, neural cell signalling, and acts as a potent antioxidant in brain cells, they say.

       USATODAY   If you have high cholesterol, you might feel like throwing up your hands when you hear that experts are now suggesting that some people reduce their LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, even lower than what doctors had been telling patients.  Q: What's different?  A: The report updates 2001 guidelines that set LDL goals of below 100 for high-risk people and below 130 for moderately high-risk people. (The U.S. average is 130.)  In addition, the update suggests lowering the point at which people should go on cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.   The 2001 guidelines recommended that high-risk or moderately high-risk patients take medicine if their LDL was 130 or higher. The update suggests lowering the treatment bar to an LDL of 100.  Q: So how many Americans should be on cholesterol-lowering drugs?  A: The authors of the new report haven't done the math yet, but they estimate perhaps 40 million, up from the 36 million under the previous guidelines.  Q: Where does lifestyle fit in?  A: If you need to lower your LDL, the authors write, try a lot of TLC, or "therapeutic lifestyle changes," such as quitting smoking, losing weight and exercising more. "I don't think we should try to do this with drugs alone," says Sidney Smith, a University of North Carolina cardiologist.  It's not going to be easy, says cardiologist Ray Gibbons of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, who was not involved in writing the update. Lowering the LDL target to below 70 "really puts an increased burden on the patients. It really makes patient compliance with lifestyle changes all that much more important."  Q: Are these experts realistic?  A: If you have a pretty high LDL to begin with, getting below 70 may be an impossible dream, the authors say. But you should at least reduce your LDL by 30% to 40%, they write.  To accomplish that, you might need to take a higher dose of a statin or add another cholesterol fighter, such as nicotinic acid or special margarines, says James Cleeman, cholesterol education program coordinator.  Q: Is an LDL below 50 next?  A: Probably not, says Smith, a past president of the American Heart Association. In parts of the world where heart disease is practically unheard of, an LDL below 70 is pretty typical, he says.  The cholesterol program is awaiting the results of three more studies, expected over the next 18 months, before settling on a definitive number.

       Health Talk    Watching a movie can raise or lower hormone levels, according to researchers. A romantic movie can boost progesterone levels by more than 10 percent, researchers at the University of Michigan report.   Researchers tested three separate groups of study subjects for hormonal levels before and after watching selected scenes from three different movies.   One group watched a romantic scene from “The Bridges of Madison County,” a second group watched portions of “The Godfather Part II’’ while a third group watched a documentary on the Amazon rainforest.   Men watching a violent scene from “Godfather Part II’’ had testosterone levels jump as much as 30 percent.   A romantic scene from “Bridges of Madison County” saw no change in the testosterone levels in women, however, men's testosterone levels fell.   The group watching a scene from the rainforest movie saw no change in hormonal levels.   “When you’re watching movies, your hormones are responding, not just your mind,’’ said Oliver Schultheiss, psychology professor at the University of Michigan. “If you want to learn about someone’s personality, look at their video collection or look at what’s on their bookshelves," added Schultheiss.

       Health Talk    Strokes are more likely to occur on a Monday, as opposed to any other day of the week, according to a Finnish study published in the July 22 online issue of the journal Stroke.   Researchers from the National Public Health Institute of Finland examined the incidence of ischemic stroke by day of the week and its relationship with age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES).    A ischemic stroke is caused by blood clots that block blood flow to the brain.   In their findings, researchers report most strokes occur on Monday with the fewest number of strokes occurring on Sunday.   The incidence of ischemic stroke is much higher in persons with low socioeconomic status than in those with high socioeconomic status, the researchers report.   The highest incidence of stroke occurred in low income elderly men aged 60 to 74, on Mondays.   No Monday excess was observed in persons with high socioeconomic status.   "This finding may suggest reasons for the higher IS (ischemic stroke) incidence in persons with low socioeconomic positions and open up some possibilities for prevention," conclude the authors.

       Tronto Star   Whether a person will be right-handed or left-handed could be decided early in the womb when the fetus is about 10 weeks old.   Scientists who studied ultrasound scans of 1,000 fetuses and followed the progress of some of them after birth, found that if a fetus preferred to suck its right thumb more than its left at 10 to 12 weeks old, the child tended to be right-handed.   "The hand you favor as a 10-week-old fetus is the hand you will favor for the rest of your life," New Scientist magazine reported this week. The findings, by Peter Hepper and researchers at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, challenge current thinking that hand preference does not develop until a child is 3 or 4 years old.   The scientists also looked at hand movement in the womb which begins at about 10 weeks and found a similar association between preference and handedness after birth.   Hepper said there is no evidence that the brain has any control over the early movements in the womb and suggests it is more likely to be a local reflex arc of the spinal cord.   "He speculates that the fetus may have a preference for one side of its body simply because that side develops slightly faster," the magazine added.

       CBC News    A little knowledge can get in the way when playing a memory game with a child.   Researchers found five-year-olds could beat most adults on a recognition memory test, at least under specific conditions.   In most cases, young adults have better memory than children.   In the new study, psychologists showed 77 children and 71 college students pictures of animals such as cats, bears and birds.   For example, subjects were shown a picture of a cat as they were told it had "beta cells inside its body." They were then shown 30 pictures of animals, one at a time, and were asked to find the one with beta cells.   The children were accurate at identifying pictures 31 per cent of the time, compared to seven per cent among the adults.   The researchers suspect adults applied what they knew to learning the information, hurting their accuracy.   "It's one case where knowledge can actually decrease memory accuracy," said Vladimir Sloutsky, director of the Center for Cognitive Science at Ohio State University, who led the study in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science.   The children, five years old on average, identified the animals with "beta cells" by checking carefully for an animal that looked like the first cat. The researchers called this form of reasoning "similarity-based induction".   The researchers say inductive reasoning is important for learning, since if one learns a cat has a particular biological property, the knowledge can be expanded to other cats.   Adults, though, grouped the animals into categories– once they identified it as a cat, they didn't pay attention to the details, which made it harder for them to recognize the pictures.   When the children were taught to use category-based induction like adults, their scores dropped to a similar level.
