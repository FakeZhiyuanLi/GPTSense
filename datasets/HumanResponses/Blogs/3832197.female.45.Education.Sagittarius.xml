      Daniel,  I cannot tell you with words all that I am feeling in my heart; words do not do my love justice. I cannot tell you how I want you deep down in my soul; words can only touch the surface. And I cannot tell you with my mouth how I yearn for you in my whole body, for words fail to come close to portraying my need. But for now, while that is all we have, please take these three words and know that they mean so much more...I love you!

      Ah Ha! I know he loves me. He thought he was in control, but he really isn't. He loves me so much that it's driving him crazy. Now he can't get me out of his mind. I think I even trouble his breathing. And when he closes his eyes, he sees me. The air moves around him, and he feels me touch him. He reaches out in the dark to take hold of me, but grasps a fist-full of empty air.  He longs for me. I've gotten into his blood, under his skin. He thinks of me all through the day and sees me in his dreams at night. I've really gotten to him. He thought he could keep control of how he was feeling about me, but he lost it. And now it's driving him crazy, because he didn't think that love would take him over quite like this.    You Want Me   As daylight dims across the room, A hunger burns you deep. It stirs the blood within your veins And keeps you from your sleep.   A shiver trickles down your neck And siphons out a sigh. In whispered breaths of lustful glee, You part your panting thighs.   You yearn to feel your fingertips Caress my wanting skin And ache to feel your manhood firm Against my flesh within.   But darkness falls against the walls And hides the tears you shed, And wraps you in its emptiness Upon its empty bed   Far deep into the haunting night Where love and distance war, And parted lips but dream the kiss Our hearts are longing for.

      This poem by Bliss Carman has always been one of my favourites. It has inspired me to write outside myself and has encouraged me when I didn't understand my own melancholy silence.    The Eavesdropper   Bliss Carman (1861- 1929)   In a still room at hush of dawn,    My Love and I lay side by side And heard the roaming forest wind    Stir in the paling autumn-tide.  I watched her earth-brown eyes grow glad    Because the round day was so fair; While memories or reluctant night    Lurked in the blue dusk of her hair.  Outside, a yellow maple tree,    Shifting upon the silvery blue With tiny multitudinous sound,    Rustled to let the sunlight through.  The livelong day the elvish leaves    Danced with their shadows on the floor; And the lost children of the wind    Went straying homeward by our door.  And all the swarthy afternoon    We watched the great deliberate sun Walk through the crimsoned hazy world,    Counting his hilltops one by one.  Then as the purple twilight came    And touched the vines along our eaves Another shadow stood without    And gloomed the dancing of the leaves.  The silence fell on my Loveâ€™s lips;    Her great brown eyes were veiled and sad With pondering some maze of dream,    Though all the splendid year was glad.  Restless and vague as a gray wind    Her heart had grown, she knew not why. But hurrying to the open door,    Against the verge of western sky  I saw retreating on the hills,    Looming and sinister and black, The stealthy figure swift and huge    Of One who strode and looked not back.

      Writers write primarily because they have something to say. Words just happen to be the medium used to translate their thoughts and feelings to others. I keep coming up blank, empty. I have so much inside that is bursting to get out; my head and my heart are filled with un-decipherable thoughts and feelings, that have no words. And all attempts to write are pathetic graspings at straws. My untouchable muse seduces me with its lie and I believe it ever time. So I begin to write...

      I thought the fear that was keeping me from writing was either the fear of failure or success. But now I really don't think so. I've known the pleasure of having my work accepted and published and the disappointment of having it rejected.  But this fear is of a more basic kind, more damaging, because it is preventing me from writing at all. This fear is the one that makes me run away from my feelings, that keeps me from staring them square in the eyes and identifying them. Without this honest connection to myself, my writing has become superficial and dull.  In order to write poems that are emotionally moving, I have in the past had to feel the emotions myself while I'm writing them. Without this ability to jump into my poems, they become mere words on a page.  So now I write in the hopes that my own words will spark my muse and once again jump start my heart.

      I have recently been trying different writing exercises to tickle my muse. I've been dabbling more in free verse lately and my outpourings seem to be about the death of the rhymer within me. Here is my most recent poem.   Something deep inside of me Died. And as falling leaves Float through a cold air, Tears scar my face, Turning it wrinkled and pale.  Words are silenced  The music stops  The dance is over  Deep shadows fall over the place Where waltzing steps Once played  In the powdery, orange glow Of evening.  Now  only dust Settles to the floor.
