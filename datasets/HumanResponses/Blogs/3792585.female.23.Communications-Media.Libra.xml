      I've been thinking a lot about love and what it really means and if it's really real.  I used to have all these preconceived notions about TRUE love and unconditional love and being IN love.  And now it all seems like a joke.  Like sarcasm.  A nasty trick.  Weakness of the mind.  Because, on the one hand, if I were to believe, then I'd have to live with this pain forever.  How could I ever trust that feeling again after having been so sure it was real, only to have it ripped out of my heart in one fell swoop.  But if I deny it, then I cannot believe that love is what I want it to be.  A gift that fills a void in your heart that you never even knew existed.    Being in love is like a dream.  When it gets to the really good part, you're so scared of it ending that you freak out and, depending on what kind of sleeper you are, you either wake up and are forced to face the end or you continue to sleep, albeit restlessly, and make it through the rough patch and onto the happily ever after.   Unfortunately, I am a light sleeper.  And even in my dreams, the thought of falling from the high point of delight down to the lowlands of pain, causes me to jerk awake and bury all of my most precious memories in the darkest part of my heart.  Hoping to forget they exist.

      It's been said that people come into our lives for a reason.  Maybe to teach a lesson, or enlighten us, or to make us stronger.  Sometimes, they wreak havoc and we're forced to learn the hard way.  Our relationships with these individuals are the hardest to justify.  It's difficult to see through the darkness they bring into our lives and we might have to dig a little deeper to realize their purpose.    I keep this in mind when I think about you.  Because I have yet to see the significance of your presence in my life.  My heart is forever altered.  With no hope of a full recovery.  I will never be the girl I was before I met you and I'm not sure that's a positive thing.  You've raped me of the ability to truly love.  Your memory will keep me wary of the kind of intimacy you made me feel and I will forever shy away from sharing my heart.    So what was your purpose?  Your reason for forcing yourself into my heart?  Desperately, I seek to answer these questions.  To find an antidote for the poison you've left inside me.  Because this hatred is exhausting.  And I'm getting very tired.

      The last month and half has been easier, after having found out how karma acted on my behalf.    But the holiday is over.    Today you are free.    Indecision is setting in.  Part of me still has a desire to call you.  To create a new ending for our story.  Or maybe a new beginning.  But it's been so long since we've exchanged our thoughts that I don't even know what I want anymore.  And I'm not sure a phonecall would do more good than bad.  I wish they would've kept you longer.  Maybe just another month.  I need more time.

      Last night, looking through a box, I found a photo.   Of us.   Looking happy.   In love.  All reds, pinks, and yellows.   My eyes broke down and tears pooled inside, blurring my vision, so that all I could see was you and I at our best.  Wiping the hazard away, I lamented about not having found that image in the wake of the wreckage, so many weeks ago.   When I had.   Washed away everything physical.   Yet, for a reason unknown, this particular photo still remains.   In that box.  A bullet waiting in the chamber.  For a game of Russian roulette.    They say my reasoning is unreasonable.  They say my unloving heart will love again.  But I’m sure I’m not so sure.   The only place I find comfort is in the un-giving arms of acceptance.  In those moments when I tell myself that I will come to terms with this pain; that I will live, feed, and learn from it.  Peace finds me in the acceptance that it will always be with me.  Burrowed inside my heart.  Shaping my destiny.    You will be the one that got away.  The one who haunts my dreams and kisses me softly as I slumber in the middle of my bed, silently begging for mercy.  It will be our memories that will always catch me short of breath.  Images to a soundtrack of well documented regret and loneliness.  I will not shake you.  I don’t know how.  Like sprinkles on ice cream, my heart is stuck to you.  Wishing to make you sweeter.  Thinking I had.    Sometimes, when you appear in my thoughts, I swear my heart stops.  For a moment.  Like when you find a bump in a line.  Leaving me stricken and paranoid.  Adrenaline rushing; hoping my sanity will cut short its hiatus. ...

      Tonight, my heart is stuck to you.  Your memory anyway, and the way you used to make me smile and laugh.  How safe I felt just knowing I was yours.  I loved you in a way that I didn't even know was possible.  A way that is making it so hard to forget.  I'd like to move on and forget how much you meant to me.  I want to forget how I would lay in bed at night and dream about our future.  How I imagined my forever with you.  I want to clean out the dark rooms in my mind and rid them of all those memories that clutter and confuse.  I want to forget that you made me feel like no one else ever has.  And most of all, I want to be convinced that there is someone out there who will make me feel that way again.

      Today, I wanna call you.  To hear that tone in your voice.  That one I used to hear in the beginning, when my phonecalls were the best part of your day.  I still remember it so well and when my eyes are closed, I can hear it perfectly.  If I let myself.  I want to hear that tone and let myself be comforted by it, just like I used to.
