      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whassup people!! i hope everybody is doing fine compared to the nightmare that i am experiencing at work lately. The new project that i am currently handling appears to be more complicated day by day, and i am beginning to hate it very very much!! . Everyday it seems that there are something new to do!! and the worst part was Deadlines. Oooh&nbsp; boy !! i hate that word.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preassure of working is finally coming to me and maybe that was the main reasons&nbsp;why i have delayed the lenght of my college studying period. The fear of having to work under somebody else and having to be obeying instead of instructing can be quite unbearable at times. But as a grown up an matured individual, i am willing to take upon any challenges and obstacles along the way on my path to be the man i am suppose to&nbsp;be "The next Li ka Shing&nbsp;" . just kidding !! being merely a&nbsp;very successful person is good&nbsp;enough for me !! ... but the most important thing .. i will make my freaking first million at the AGE of&nbsp;38. At that age it is one way or the other, either i become a millionaire or i will end up being a 38( sam pat lou&nbsp;) '_'&nbsp;.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway another friendly reminder. the people that you mixed with would also influence your future like how this certain person has did to mine. Although things didnt turned out fine at last, but i have never regretted it as&nbsp;the things that i have gone through while neglecting my studies are very memorable and priceless. These are the activities that a normal person might not experienced. I would like to thank my good friend Mr. Fabian for making what i am today !! He was always there when i skipped class and he is always there to encourage and support me to Neglect my studies. Lol .. where to find la such an exotic friend. !! Just kidding !! .. and Fabian, if you are reading this post, It was only a joke. you need to let me release all these anger and preasure that i am having into writing as i dont have a craving for boozing like YOU.&nbsp; Anyway .. Good Luck in your finals !!

       A funny thing happen today. I am able to witness two of my best friend act like B******S when they have some misunderstanding over such a silly matter. It appears that during an important meeting which me, F and J attended, J somehow badmouthed and insulted F in the meeting which F appears to be somehow!somewhat an important person in the event. He was quite pissed of as the chairperson of the meeting somehow scolded him for having such a disrespectful friend.     &nbsp;  So after the meeting the both of them started to argue as if they are some darn couples that are married for 15 years. And me being the nice person have to console both of the individually&nbsp; and felt really quite amused at their antics. Anyway everything turn out fine after they begun to talk 2 hrs later. The funnies thing was to experience first hand the conversation of those two gays which sounded :-    &nbsp;  F : pls tell J that ....   M : J, F says you are .....   J : tell F that he is&nbsp; a .....    M : F, J says ....     &nbsp;  ( this conversation has been censored for its foul content )    &nbsp;  Anyway the lesson to be learnt here is that best friends are for keeps so no matter what happens, we shouldnt get pissed for a long time at each other, and this is the spirit that we practised in our gang of friends and i would like to say that i am proud to be one of them. In the end, everybody lives happily ever after.    &nbsp;  Kudos!!
