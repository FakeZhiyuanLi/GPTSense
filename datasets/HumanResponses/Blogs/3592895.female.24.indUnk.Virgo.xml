      Hi, guys! I've just arrived from PUC and decided to post a message here to tell you all that the seminars at PUC today were just wonderful. I really appreciated them. Those who I met there know what I'm talking about. I'm sure we learned a lot today.  See you.

      Remember? I've suggested some alternative stuff for your internship, in case you're interested, such as: a) watch the movie 'Pi' and elaborate a seminar to be done by 22 or 23 graders. b) watch the Iranian movie 'The Jar'and write about connections between the movie and our practice. c) write journal entries, about what you see & feel & would like to investigate at the classes you're attending at CAp.  more to come soon... feel free to post your own suggestions....
