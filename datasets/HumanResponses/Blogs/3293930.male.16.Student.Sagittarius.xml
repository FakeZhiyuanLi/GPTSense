      It's easy to forget the true meaning of this day, what with all the important things we have to do like homework, barbecues, swimming, and otherwise enjoying life. All of these things are possible because of the great nation that we live in, a nation that those who came before us died to create and defend. Try and remember those who fought and died for our country on every day of the year, and especially today.

       urlLink NY Times criticizes its Iraq war coverage   So how does that foot taste? The NY Times isn't as prestigious as it once was, but most of its loss is caused by other news sources like television and the internet replacing it, not editorial mistakes. Yet another blow to the Bush's reelection campaign.

      Just wanted to remind all my fellow Ramona High denizens to go to the  urlLink Oxford English Dictionary  if you need to use a dictionary while doing homework. A paper dictionary may seem harder to lose but this is even harder. Plus, it's by British people, so it must be great. After all, they invented English, right? Use the secret passwords from the library!

      So, I finally decided to be one of the first in my small "hicktown" to have a blog. I don't quite know what I'm going to do with it, but stay tuned for more irrevalencies, inconsequential anecdotes, rants, and insightful comments on life in general. Just like any other blog. Yep.

      I just finished reading  1984 , by George Orwell. As usual for me, it was hard to put the book down after I started reading it this morning. I would call the day wasted, but it's summer and it was a good book. Now I can sleep, as long as I make sure I don't mumble "Down with Big Brother!" in my sleep loud enough that the telescreen can pick it up.

      It always seems like when I come up with a good idea on something to post, I forget it. I could either start writing ideas down, or I could post about how this deficiency of mine. Maybe I'll do both.

       urlLink  Voting rights for teens 14 and over    This new proposal would give 14 and 15 year olds a quarter vote and 16 and 17 year olds a half vote. Teen advocates of this proposal argue that they deserve the right to vote, as working teens pay taxes and are directly affected by school budget cuts. Shouldn't they get to decide where their money goes? Opponents argue that the average teen isn't responsible enough to vote and worry over the logistical and ethical problems of giving out partial votes.  I can personally attest that the average teenager I meet while walking around school is not ready to vote. Teens, on average, are not that well-informed of current events and wouldn't be able to make informed decisions. Case in point: American Idol. It was probably because of the votes of thousands of 14-18 year olds that losers who couldn't sing continued in the competition. Does this mean that politicians who can't balance budgets or write legislation will receive teen votes just because they act  cool  on camera? Probably. Most teens would only duplicate their parents vote anyways. Teens who do want to have a voice in politics can do so without voting.
