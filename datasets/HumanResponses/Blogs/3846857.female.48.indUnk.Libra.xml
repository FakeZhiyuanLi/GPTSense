      Thanks for the comment Brown Eyed Girl - also one of my favorite songs. I have found I CAN be friends, even close friends, with Democrats as long as we have other interests and try to avoid discussing politics. I have never been able to handle being around anyone who is constantly saying mean things about Republicans in general, or, at present, George Bush, specifically. Part of the reason I have such a visceral response to trash talking the US or our president is that I really believe that it divides us and only encourages our enemies to try to take advantage of that rift. We can't afford not to be unified. We don't all have to love the current administration, but we can believe in America and stand as a unified front against the terrorists.  There are certain policies of the President's that I have not personally agreed with, but what I DO appreciate about him is that he doesn't need to take a public opinion poll before making a decision. He does what he thinks is right, regardless of whether or not that decision is popular with the Republican rank and file. I can appreciate a man who has his own mind.

      Well, I've blogged on and on about BB5, but I am also passionate about politics, and Kerry's selection of running mate John Edwards has prompted me to say a few words on the subject.  First of all, I freely admit to being a diehard Republican. It's unfortunate that Kerry picked Edwards, as he's a good looking guy, and will undoubtedly attract many votes from those who enter the voting booths next November without knowing a thing about the issues. I think we should have to pass an IQ test before voting. I also think one should be able to speak English. Why, oh why do we have to publish voter guides in 50 different languages!? Ok, maybe 50 is an exaggeration, but, still, this is America, where we DO speak ENGLISH! Whatever happened to the immigrants who came to America because they loved this country and embraced our culture and the American dream? Am I a racist? No. I'm just pro-American, and want those immigrating to this country to feel the same.  I'm also tired of the anti-American sentiment abroad. All those countries "across the pond" talk trash about our "capitalistic society", but that never stops them from constantly asking us for money. Where the heck do they think we get that money from?? I'm sure Michael Moore is a superstar in France. They do love Jerry Lewis, after all...  Ok... end of rant for today. It's bad for my blood pressure.

      I feel like it's Christmas Eve or something! Can't wait for BB5 to start, and am definitely dying for the 24/7 live feeds to begin! I love having a laptop and wireless DSL during BB season, as I can take my laptop to bed with me and listen and watch the live feeds. I also have wireless headphones, which means I can wander around the house and not miss a word. The wireless headphones were a gift from my family who were sick and tired of having to listen to BB constantly. Now they just have to wave at me and say, "Earth to Mom.", and I can take the headphones off if they need to speak to me.

      Yes, folks, it's true. Tomorrow begins the "high holy day" of all reality TV lovers - the beginning of this summer's Big Brother! We're now up to Big Brother 5 now, and I have been hooked from the beginning. The Amazing Race also begins tomorrow night, July 6th, which is another favorite, but doesn't even come close to my addiction to BB.  Just in case you need more information, are curious, or would like to sign up for the 24/7 live feeds (a MUST for every true addict), here is the CBS link to BB5: http://www.cbs.com/primetime/bigbrother5/index.shtml  My family usually says goodbye to me the day BB starts, and knows I will, more or less, return to sanity and the "real world" at its conclusion in September. Of course, there are usually a few days of mourning and withdrawal to contend with when it's over - but that's understandable.  Another one of my favorite sites is "TV ClubHouse". There you will find message boards and info on almost every reality TV show. Check it out. They even have people who watch the live feeds 24/7 and then type out every conversation for the sake of those without the feeds. Now THAT takes dedication! And people think I have no life.... Anyway here's the link for TV ClubHouse: http://tvclubhouse.bomis.com/index.html  Believe it or not, I do have other things going on in my life, which I will write about from time to time - such as the fact that we just returned from a trip to Los Angeles to attend the wedding of Joe McComb and his bride, Kate. Joe used to be in the church youth group, and we've known him since he was a kid. We saw a lot of kids from that time period, and it's so funny to see them all grown up!! I tried hard not to feel old...
