      WEll it's that time of year...yeah...MY fifteen year old is going back to high school. AS I sat in the class rooms last night for open house I relized how good we had it...no rent, no taxes, and no RESPONSIBILITIES.....WOW what I would give for those days and to be able to "DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN"... well we can't!!..... I guess the real question would be not if I would do all over again...duh, but what would I change.. man those were good times(crazy times) , how did we ever survive..I'll tell you ; sheer LUCK!!!! I  had my son when I was 18 and shortly divorced after that . We have been on our OWN since then, yeah I have dated but only 4 men made the cut to ever meet my son( in 14 years..wow I have to get out more often)  I never finished college right away( don't worry I did it, Dabbled in the experimental issues( sex drugs and rock and roll)..don't lie you all did it!!! I lived a rock star life for a while...WEll I'm 34 now, finacially secure and trying to capture my youth  once again???..what a dose a reality I got last night. looking around at those youngsters AND their parents... My son is excited to be going back to AFJROTC .. HE has found his  place and he absolutely loves it...and that  as we ALL know is  oh so important in HIGH SCHOOL..BY the way he is also an EAGLE SCOUT....  NOW it is official  ...I am now a full member of the boosters club..and as he sat there next to me as I filled out this paper to sign up...well look of his face reminded me of when he was on the soccer field for the first time when he was 6 and looked over  to see me there screaming him own (probably right before I yellow carded).........PROUD....I quess my answer to what would I change......NOT A DAMN THING....Thomas momma loves you

      Well God spared me and my family with only minor damage to family in Orlando. Wow I thought we were screwed. My brother flew in Thursday and we went and sandbagged his house on Bay shore Blvd(the street ) right on the Gulf(not that it would have done a damn thing to help).  My friend (she also lives on the water) came out to stay w/ me in Valrico, Fl and we stocked up the goods. plenty of beer, wine, candles and munchies of all sorts. I grow up between Hawaii and Key WEST...so I have been through A FEW hurricans. I have to tell you I wasn't scared at first, but when that turned into a catagory 4...I shit myself.Showers  for everyone and I ran the water in the tub for baths later(maybe if the buths were still there)..the other tub was for saftey from the tornados spawned trough out the day.. WE had a meeting about what to do if we had to get out quick and where we would meet later( I begged it never got to that)    WE watched and waited.. there's not a damn thing you can do but PRAY and PRAY I DID.. It must have worked because Charley turned directly EAST and nailed South FLORIDA.. All I can do now is PRAY for the people who are now homeless, dead or still missing..send help the form of money and other simple items. As we talk about what we missed I have to remind people that the hurrican season is just beginning and that we do l ive in Florida.. so keep you eyes on the weather man and keep us and those in south florida in your prayers...Kirsten

      Today I sit with a new found glory...you see for months now the slut of the office has been torturing my co-worker...well I now know WHY.....the slut slept with her boyfrind..I responsed " and she's mad?" WEll it came to a head yesterday and the cat is out off the bag. The coworker finally spoke w/ the office manger about the issue and told her all..now I'm not one to gossip, but I am sure  the word will get aroung the office ASAP and all those people who supported the poor victim (the slut) and encouraged AND participated in her quilt drivin rage will soon  her (the slut) in a whole new light...at least I hope. YES  I sit a little easier at my desk today..just having the knowledge

      As I sit here at my desk working on a batch to medical code , I am quickly reminded of a poem my father taught me as a young child. It goes like this , "As I was going up the stairs I meet a man who wasn't there, He wasn't there again today, my Gosh I wish he go away.." with this in mind I thought to myself.               Self, what is the deal with my supervisor? I speak from experience when I say being the boss sucks! But when do you to say enough is ENOUGH.. so my question is to you..  Is  it good supervisor policy to piss off your best employees because your friends  with a lousy one? I'm so sick of office politics I could choke myself with my mousepad.
