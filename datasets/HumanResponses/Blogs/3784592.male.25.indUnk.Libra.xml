      I've decided to give a little insight to where the term jesus juice came from. So I'm watching tv one night i think it was E news or something and this woman who works for vogue magazine starts to talk about her article she wrote about Michael Jackson's life and the new sex scandal. Im intrigued and my eyes are glued to the tv, she starts to talk about Michael's private jet and how he takes groups of kids on trips to god knows where, anyway she starts to say Michael likes to get his kiddie companions all liquored up with something he calls "Jesus Juice". Once i heard this name i was hooked. Michael apparently likes to fill empty cans of soda with wine coolers and wine, then he hands it to the kids claiming its juice from jesus and they should feel honored to be given such a treat. I dont know about you but i would feel pretty fuckin honored at nine years old to be given such a holy opportunity. lol. Even if this claim is untrue, i love its brilliance, the name just rolls off the tongue.  Today wasn't too bad. Actually made it to the gym and I didn't run into chester the molester (will explain on next blog) Decided at work today that we should have a wall of dwarfs playing orchestra on square cut outs in our wall, such a great visual lol. I'm still trying to find one to pose as my pet for an undisclosed amount of money hehe. Today's word of the day is ignorant, or as some folk say ignent lol, you know who you are!  btw, why do they keep giving Halle Berry work? Grrrrr  Listening to: Beth Orton - thinking about tomorrow

      I am not a writer nor claim to be. I came upon this site aimlessly weeding through friendster, sad i know. After laughing my ass off reading some of the blogs ( where did this name originate from?) posted i've decided to start my own, seems harmless enough. I guess i'll start with my day. I woke up around 8am in hopes i might drag my sorry ass to the gym but after lying in bed for 45 minutes weighing the pros and cons of this venture i decided to let laziness win. Instead i decided to go to a 10:45am showing of "saved". There is something eerily comforting going to the movies by yourself, hmmmmm that sounds really sad hehe oh well. I have this strange obsession with Mandy Moore, i dont know what it is and i refuse to think to much about it, because in doing so i will end up questioning my gayness and thats a whole other blog. I left "Saved" feeling uplifted and truly in need of finding a religion of my own. After a 20 minute ride on the red line and 30 minute masterbating session ive come to the conclusion this religion suites me just fine. I listened to fnx for the first time in about a year and realized why i stopped listening in the first place.   I live with two girls in cambridge the situation is very Threes Company. One of my roommies came home today with an interesting reason why she's been MIA all weekend. I'll start with the back ground info. Big B (my new name for her for this blog) has been cheating on her bf for three months now with this guy from Iran. Big B broke it off with her bf about a week ago, with all this new found single time on her hands Big B naturally started taking the I-Sore (new name for Iranian man for blog) to the next level. Spending as much time as she can with him since she will be leaving for the summer in a week. She comes home today and tells my other roommie and me she was supposed to see him on Saturday night but he blew her off text message stating he had an issue to deal with and an apology. Yesterday while on the high way she answers her cell to a woman asking where I-Sore is, the phone call breaks up and Big B is left with no explanation of who this female stranger is. Later that day Big B gets a phone call from I-Sore stating he has some confessions to make, the following are these confessions, 1) He is 38 not 28 2) He's married not Single 3) Has three kids 9mos, 4, 5 (i think those are the ages) 4) Wants a seperation from his wife 5) Has had 2 previous girlfriends before Big B  The moral: If Big B had only turned to Jesus none of this would have happened. Till Tuesday.  Listening to - Modest Mouse "float on"

      im working on my first iced coffee at 9:15pm and i think its a gonna be along night. ive had a headache all day and i believe its due to the lack of coffee intake. i told myself id write about chester the molester but i really dont feel like it.  im contemplating moving to the cali and i keep going over the pros and cons. its a big leap. one ive been ready for a while now. financialy im not in the position to take on this venture. the job i have now does not pay nearly as much as it should. i can get another suck ass job that will 1) stress me the fuck out 2) leave me no time to touch myself in the way im accustomed to. so my only option is to sell my body on the side, hehehe. so now im thinking ill suck it up get another job save up some dough and get the fuck out of Mass. im 25, single, in a dead end job, shit pay, living off ramen, nows the time to move on:) My other roomie big b has flown the nest and her two month replacement moves in today, he seems like a cool guy so far, i was scoping out the luggage and he's packing a guitar at least i think its a guitar, it could very well be a machine gun. hopefully he does drugs and knows how to share. im watching reality bites and im finding freaky simalarities to my life. tomorrow will be job hunting day and im dreading every moment all ready, not sure if i should start on a friday though.
