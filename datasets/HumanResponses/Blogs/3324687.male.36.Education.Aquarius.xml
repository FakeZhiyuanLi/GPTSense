      Today several branches of my family tree were grafted back onto the main trunk.  As my sister Becky & I walked across the  urlLink Wilson Chapel Cemetery  (she donated the new flags in the photo), she recounted little known, almost lost details from family members I vaguely remember ever knowing anything about:  my great-grandmother Cynthia Ann Pipes (b. July 3, 1891; d. January 18, 1945) who raised two children alone after her husband deserted her; my great-uncle Everett D. Pipes (b. March 22, 1910; d. November 18, 1935) who fell out a two-storey window and was placed in a mental institution until he undoubtedly died of brain damage.  I also learned of my grandfather's secret family in Dallas where he lived and worked for several years after the cotton fields were abandoned while my grandmother continued living on the farm in Peeltown with her own horde of children.  Then we moved on to Mount Olive Cemetery (which was in horrible shape) to visit our grandparents' graves as well as our Uncle Frank's, who was killed in Vietnam.  We finished our trek through this cemetery by visiting the graves of our great-grandparents Joe & Thirza Garrett.  Ah! more names and more information to run through my searches in hopes of finding more about my family.

      Drank a couple of whiskey sours at the Inwood Lounge last night with Kris & Stephen as we raked several people over the coals of our discontent.  Later, had a beer with the Serb posse at Spike.  All that alcohol (as well as the heat & humidity & breakfast cheesecake) did me in as I tried to jog in the neighborhood late this morning.  I won't be doing that any more.  This day has been fairly uneventful, but tomorrow we're going out to Becky's; and together we're going to the cemetery in Scurry to decorate the family graves.  Very pleased with the new CD.  I'll call this week to schedule a time to get it mastered; and after I finish the design, it'll be available for purchase online.

      When we were kids, everytime someone said "Wal-Mart," it was obligatory for the listener to say "Fall Apart" immediately afterwards.  It was one of those bizarre, linguistic games that only kids and Swedes can get away with.  (Someday I'll tell the tale of Morgan, the liguistical Swede....)  Now when I think about such games, it seems like an attempt to work some word magic, like when repeating a word with a "shm" prefix:  happy shmappy.  Love shmove.  Job shmob.  You are eroding the power of a word by SHMessing it up, SHMucking it up to where it no longer holds sway over your life.  After shopping at Wal-Mart last night with the great unwashed masses of South Dallas (of which I belong, at least geographically), I pray this meager magic eventually works:  Wal-Mart Fall Apart!

      Thank god there's cheesecake in the house or I'd simply go berserk trying to re-decipher student loan applications & processes after so many years not having to think of such things (except, of course, remembering to debit my bank account every month for the money the Dept. of Education takes out to repay itself for my lovely education that has gotten me to this most honored, respected & privileged position in my life).  Ah, the scent of Ivory Towers fills my nostrils once again!  Speaking of scents, I finally heard the lyrics to the new Outkast song "Roses":  "I know you'd like to thank your ---- don't stank...."  Brilliant!  Marianne Faithful's cover of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero" still gives me the chills:  "You like to think that you're classless & free, but you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see."  I'd like to see Marianne Faithful wrestle Stanley Fish to the death ... at least theoretically.

      While I was working out this afternoon, listening to my MD entitled “Angry Women,” I kept thinking of Todd and how we had a relationship that lasted for years based solely on the fact that we never had a relationship.  It all started backstage during  Our Town  during the late autumn of 1988; lasted through some minor kissing & groping parked in his car after a couple of wine coolers; the reappearance in spring 1991 when he searched me out to apologize; when he wrote a letter from Memphis in winter 1993 declaring himself queer, out, and proud; in spring 1997 when he introduced me to his wife Laramie; until I finally wrote him a letter while I was living in Japan (spring 1998) with these fateful words:  “How is it that we’ve managed to have a relationship based solely on the fact that we’ve never had a relationship?”  That was seven years ago.  And since then, not a single word.  Funny, eh?

      Does anyone out there know Frederica from Italy with a dog named Sascha and a grandmother from Croatia who hangs out at Torrefazione on Travis Street in Dallas?  If so, my friend Nikola would like to see her again before she moves back to Italy.  More Reasons to Love Dallas:   #1 in crime (again ... for the 6th year in a row)  its citizens recycle a mere 4% of their waste (and I'm convinced that I do most of that!)  3rd fattest city in the US   They need me here!  Walked/jogged 7 miles yesterday.  Took a break from that as well as many other things today.  Joined Nikola for coffee at Torrefazione in the late morning.  I complimented him by saying that he's one of my few friends who has decent friends.

      As Maurice Blanchot reminds us in his  The Writing of the Disaster , there can be no experience of the disaster simply because the disaster always happens after it has happened.  September 11th has little, if nothing, to do with the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001:  September 11th is all about the aftermath of that disaster, as we futilely attempt to recreate/represent/reveal the truth of that experience in a continual recreation/repetition of it.  This is precisely why there will be no truth coming from any 9/11 Commission.  Mel Gibson’s  The Passion of the Christ  is equally laughable in its arrogant attempt to represent any passion of any Christ, let alone one that requires determinate articles.  You cannot get at the disaster by trying to recreate the disaster because the disaster is untouchable by mere human efforts, even if humans created the disaster.  The Holocaust cannot be represented.  Despite the filmed and photographic archives, this disaster was so much more than emaciated faces staring through barbed wire or bulldozers plowing through a pile of corpses.  The disaster speaks of the absence of the disaster:  “ When all is said, what remains to be said is the disaster.  Ruin of words, demise writing, faintness faintly murmuring:  what remains without remains  (the fragmentary)” (33).   Like the fat American nonchalantly looking at his hands that all too often has been cropped out of the photograph of the Iraqi prisoner standing on a box, with a hood over his head, with wires attached to his body--a photograph of the disaster depicts the absence of the disaster.  What is not shown is closer to the disaster:  the terror and abuse of a human against another human all in the name of saving humanity.  (But which man here is more dehumanized?  The Iraqi prisoner?  The fat American?  The photographer? The president who ordered the war?  Or any other countless participants or spectators?)  And yet still it is not disaster but a mere shadow of it.

      Stayed out last night with Stephen, Douglas, & Shannon until after 1:00 AM drinking whiskey sours at Barbara's Pavilion.  Then crawled out of the apartment at 10:00 after initially waking up around 6:00.  Insomnia is my new best friend.  Went to El Jordan for Mexican breakfast and bumped into . . . Douglas & Shannon.  We all haven't socialized in months (probably close to 9 months!), and now we've spent all evening and all morning together.  Bought vegetables and fruit at the Farmers Market downtown after breakfast.  Splurged on two baskets of raspberries at a $1.00 each.  Met Kris around 6:00 for a one-hour walk on the Katy Trail, then came home for gazpacho and potatoes and the season finale of  urlLink The Simpsons .  Strangely compelled by today's  urlLink Doonesbury  strip:  it was censored in the Dallas paper because of the decapitated head even though it was actually written before the Nick Berg incident.  What a strange world this is:  the Dallas paper also printed a photo of Mr. Berg's head held up by his murderer, but that too was censored . . . but with only a black box over the head.  And now this comic strip--that doesn't even reference the event & is often censored by the editors of one-horse town's newspaper--always already references the Berg murder and therefore requires censoring.  All this is enough to make me, too, lose my head....

      My 16-year-old nephew Timothy came up from the hinterlands of East Texas late yesterday afternoon to spend the night before heading to a party this evening.  We sat around most of the evening talking before eating pizza at Vitto in Oak Cliff's  urlLink Bishop Arts District . Afterwards we walked around, then settled at Nodding Dog for tea and live music.  After an even lazier morning around the apartment, we went to Torrefazione for coffee and muffins, Virgin Megastore for music (and virgins ... but alas, none were to be had!), and White Rock Lake for a walk.  Since he left, I've been working/reworking a song I entered in a contest several months ago.  The original version used copyrighted material from the contest sponsors, and since I didn't win (BOO!), I've been rewriting/recreating/reworking/replacing that material with my own.  It's kind of fun hearing this newer, even more original version of something I finished back then.  The title is "Rusted City (History is A...)," and I'm planning for it to end my next CD:  an EP entitled  Harm , which will also include the following soon-to-be club hits:  "Harm," "Satisfied," "The Dream Beyond," & "False Starts."  The tracks will be mastered in early June and probably released around July or August.  Stay tuned here for updated information as it becomes available.  Finally, I'd like to wish my 12-year-old niece Felisha a very wonderful & happy birthday.

       Chalabi's Seat of Honor Lost to Open Political Warfare With U.S.   urlLink NY Times   Happy to see that Ahmad Chalabi is finally paying the devil his dues.  Remember:  he's the Iraqi who fed American intelligence agencies "information" regarding weapons of mass destruction recently described as "useless at best, and misleading at worst."  After thousands of deaths.  Now if only his cabal of like-minded war-mongers, including Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Cheney would lose favor in this administration....  I can think of several other ways to spend the over $33 million in American tax money freely given to a petty crook, not to mention the billions spent on an illegal and immoral war.  On a lighter note...  Voted on my favorite  urlLink comic strips  this past week.  Here are my top 5 choices:  Ballard Street  Bizarro  The Boondocks  Get Fuzzy  Pearls Before Swine   The Dallas Morning News  is revamping its comics page.  If you read the  DMN , go to  urlLink dallasnews.com/texasliving  to cast your own vote.  Successfully completed the  urlLink Katy Trail  5K last night.  My official time was 43:39.65, so I did meet my goal of being under 50 minutes--which was no small feat considering the humidity & heat, the crowd & traffic, and the uphill climb on a new trail with an empty belly.  I'll do even better next time.

      In memory of Gloria Anzald&uacute;a, who died yesterday:    Living on borders and in margins, keeping intact one's shifting and multiple identity and integrity, is like trying to swim in a new element, an "alien" element. There is an exhilaration in being a participant in the further evolution of humankind, in being "worked" on. I have the sense that certain "faculties"--not just in me but in every border resident, colored or noncolored--and dormant areas of consciousness are being activated, awakened. Strange, huh? And yes, the "alien" element has become familiar--never comfortable, not with society's clamor to uphold the old, to rejoin the flock, to go with the herd. No, not comfortable but home.    --from the Preface to  Borderlands/La Frontera:  The New Mestiza   The video of Nick Berg's murder has surpassed Internet searches for Britney Spears.  And since I can't imagine that a new subset of the populace has turned to the Internet in hopes of gaining unfiltered information, it seems that those who were previously disposed toward celebrity gossip and scandal-mongering have turned their attention toward the (other) grotesque.  Having already seen and experienced so much pain and torment firsthand, I have no interest in watching any type of violence, whether it be in the form of Mel Gibson's bloody depiction of a crucifixion or a terrorist snuff video.  Nor can I throw any support behind the argument that we must see it in order to "know our enemy."  Viewing Mr. Berg's murder has as much to do with civic responsibility as Ms. Spears' music has to do with art and originality.  Our enemy is not a band of murderers in turbans but rather our own murderous proclivities.  When we humans watch a murder, we focus on the act, on the actors committing the atrocity, on the face of the other, refusing to notice amid all this objectification that his face is but a reflection of our own fear and hatred.  Moreover, I don't need to watch this video to recharge my "righteous outrage."  I always already know that it's wrong to murder someone.  The trick is to continue working toward a world that values all life without any notion of self-righteous vengeance to aid in one's pursuits.  By the way, if you were more offended or horrified by Mr. Berg's decapitated head than the children murdered by the Israeli army in Gaza or the pile of bodies from the Iraqi wedding party or African victims of AIDS, you, my friend, are less a moral being and more an ideologue.  Or worse:  a racist.  And from my own personal experience, it's damn hard not to be either.  Disclaimer:  No deities were crucified or otherwise harmed in the creation of my morality.

       U.S. Citizen Murdered in Yerevan    urlLink BakuTODAY.net   A friend of a friend....  There but for the grace of God go any of us....  Words fail me (knowing perfectly well that I, too, fail words ... and deeds).  Joshua was a 33-year-old peace activist & environmentalist who also traveled the world teaching English.  He was one of Tetsuya's friends from Kitakyushu.  Sometimes it's hard to have connections with others around the world, especially when the emotional distance is not quite as large as the geographical.  Coupled with my acute empathy, it's a wonder I've been able to keep moving on emotionally ... or geographically.  I wish I could be in Fukuoka to comfort my friend who has lost his friend.  My greatest concern is that by referencing Joshua's death I've somehow exploited him or been somewhat guilty of self-aggrandizement:   look at me!  see how I feel!   That certainly is not my intention.  I have Sandra Bernhard's comments on Princess Di's death always in the front of my mind when I talk/write about others' tragedies:  nobody should care how Tom Cruise felt when he heard the news.  But after a night of poor sleep, I'm too much in my own head today.  After blowing off all those emails from my students for yet another day, I'm going to force myself to work out and then head to a coffee shop to read some in Che Guevara's  The Motorcycle Diaries .

      Realized this morning that I've been vegetarian for 1/2 my life now.  Total mileage yesterday:  5.5  Today I'm taking a break from running to give my ankles, shins & hips a rest before beginning again tomorrow.  The 5K is Thursday.   6/12* Lemon Grass "Ice Cream"     2 cups yoghurt   1 cup milk   1/2 cup lemon juice   1/4 cup sugar   1 stalk lemon grass   Chop the lemon grass & blanch it.  Mix ingredients.  Freeze according to your ice cream maker's instructions.  Feel free to substitute all dairy ingredients with non-fat or non-dairy. Or substitute sugar with maple syrup or some other sweetener.  I prefer to use vanilla-flavored rice milk & soy yoghurt for a vegan dessert.  * This recipe was inspired by a similar version served at Cafe Zurawia 6/12 in Warsaw, Poland.   Congratulations to my queer brothers & sisters in Massachusetts who were (finally) granted legal marriages yesterday.  One day, and the world has not ended yet ... unless you're considering what's happening in Iraq (the Iraqi Council President was murdered by a suicide bomber) or Israel (Israel attacked a Palestinian refugee camp and murdered at least 12 people).  But those things have nothing in common with queer marriages in MA . . . unless you consider that the administration(s) that brought about the situations in Israel & Iraq is/are against queer marriage--which must mean that queer marriage is a good thing.  As one of my more insightful students argued:  sometimes the slippery slope slides up.  I'm sorry, Mr. Bowie, but you will just have to find someone else to make your intolerably unlistenable last album interesting.  Your  Reality  is sad & poor.  Almost ready to release my new site to the world:   urlLink Skajlab V .  I started 5 years ago this month during my last few weeks in Japan.  And now it's all sleek & exciting (I hope), and much more interesting (I hope).  If not, tell me!  I'm a much more interesting person in-person than I've ever been online.  And I'm a demon in the sack....

      The concerts Friday night were very exciting:  the experimental/techno-friendly  urlLink Tree Wave , the alternative rock  urlLink Sekiden  all the way from Australia, and the ever techno-erotic industrial/synth pop  urlLink The Lovemakers .  If anyone lives in the DFW metroplex, I highly recommend the  urlLink Rubber Gloves  venue in Denton:  good space & great crowd that was so goddamned Molly Ringwald circa 1985 it made my tits hurt.  Picked up Zoran & Dragana a little after 10:00 PM and then drove the 40 miles to Denton.  Even the chill in the air helped make the perfect night out.  We didn't get home until after 3:00 AM.  We crashed until after 11:00 the next morning and couldn't/didn't do much Saturday, being in recovery for not having gone out clubbing for several months.  Sunday we got up at 4:30 AM to pick up Shayne from the airport.  There were no coffee shops open as we neared downtown, so we continued all the way to Kaufman, where we spent the entire morning and a chunk of the afternoon sitting in her garden chatting.  Last night I did 2 miles.  This morning I did another 2 miles and lifted weights.  Today I haven't been able to concentrate on my music very much.  Thinking of ditching the mash-up contest since the deadline is in two days.  I'd much rather rework my own "Rusted City (History Is A ...)" in order to have my next EP mastered early in June.

      It's only been one week since the demise of Ross (at least in the nightmares I was having before the conclusion of  Friends , that's how the series ended:  with Ross dying of severe brain hemorrhaging in Rachel's arms), and I've felt so free since his death.  Training almost every weekday for next Thursday's 5K; yesterday I ran over 3 miles and walked another 2.  Had lunch with my sister Becky at Napoli in Terrell.  Then we shopped together before I drove back to Dallas.  She bought a necklace; I bought a toothbrush.

      Check out Mz. Chrzanka's blog at  urlLink halochrzanka .  By the way,  chrzan  is Polish for horseradish; and I can confirm Mz. Chrzanka's horsiness as well as her radishness.  There was a huge stink bug ( Stinkimus maximus ) crawling up my front window.  But it was not quite as huge as the spider spinning its nasty web out the backdoor.  Stephen introduced me to the genius of  urlLink Soviet Kitsch .  From the cover, you won't be able to tell what kind of music she writes, but you've got to hear Regina Spektor's voice and piano playing.  I recommend "Carbon Monoxide" and "Chemo Limo," because if you have to choose....  Speaking of specters, here's a poem I wrote a few years ago: The Leaving of the Ghost  3:52 in the morning the black cat crossed himself and crossed my stomach thrice I woke up in your head holding myself with fat-free fingers a word of love on my low-cal lips I became thinner and thinner a white shadow instead of night in my eyes seeing dreams in my own dreams magic left with my will I hear footsteps on the stoop the clock— four short bells levitation, no longer my game I pull the covers tight breathe my back back on the bed finally a dog howls

      Was in Dallas’s first showing of Michael Moore’s  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11   this afternoon.  I was surprised that in our very conservative village, there wasn’t more hoopla on its opening day.  There was no line when we bought our tickets just less than an hour before show time.  However, after walking around West Village for about twenty minutes, the press was beginning to arrive, interviewing ticket buyers in the lobby.  The auditorium was crowded; the show was very nearly, if not completely, sold-out.  Throughout the next two hours, Moore convincingly argued the obvious.  The most damning evidence against Bush was unedited footage of Bush speaking without Moore’s commentary.  Or when Moore let the soldiers or the veterans of the war speak for themselves.  Their words underscored their lack of experience and insight as well as their deplorable naïveté.  However, Moore, although indicting not just President Bush and his warmongering cabal but the Democratic Party, the media, and corporate America as well, expresses great sympathy for our servicemen and women who are actually carrying out this administration’s seriously flawed policy.  The cuts and shifts in narrative were very well done and worked well to advance Moore’s gadfly politicking (of which I am a fan).  I, however, would have preferred a bit more cinematic touch to the scene when Bush hears of the planes slamming into the World Trade Center while Moore ponders just what was going on in the president’s mind.  Instead, a more compelling scene would have been footage of Bush reading with the children in Florida with audio from New York, or even vice-versa:  minute-by-minute footage of New York/Washington with the children’s voices reading  My Pet Goat .  Moore showed an amazing amount of restraint in both the footage he used and well as the issues he addressed.  But, of course, he had the herculean task of sifting through what must have been thousands of hours of footage that could have been used to make his case.  For example, there was no mention whatsoever of the many protests against the invasion of Iraq.  The story of self-professed patriot Lila Lipscomb struck a nerve.  We first meet her raising a flag on her house in Flint, Michigan, and listing the family members (daughter, father, uncles, cousins, etc.) who have served in the military of the United States.  Later, she reads the last letter her son wrote from Iraq, arriving just a week before she receives a call from the Defense Department with the news of his death.  At the end of the film, she has traveled to D.C., where a witless woman accosts her, complaining that the protest in front of the White House is staged.  “My son,” she starts, and then in tears, “My son was killed in Iraq.”  All I could think of was my own poor grandmother who suffered through the loss of her youngest son in that other illegal and immoral war in Viet Nam.  My family never survived his death, so much so that when I was a child—a few years after the fact—I had nightmares about my uncle’s death, and I never even knew him.  I grew up certain that I wouldn’t live to be twenty because my namesake didn’t either.  Bush has lost the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And he has lost the war in America.  My hope is that this film will help us regain the government of this great country.

      Came across this brilliant & hysterically funny blog yesterday and wanted to share it with my cyber-mates:   urlLink Glib Gibberish .  I know she's written only three entries so far, but I've been laughing and sharing her stories for the past 24 hours.  Sent off the application for the residency program this afternoon.  As we said in Japan, "Wish me ruck!"  So far behind on my to-do list that I can see my ass when I'm facing the mirror.  Hope to get a bit more caught up tomorrow.  Tonight  urlLink Los Lonely Boys  are playing at the  urlLink Pegasus Plaza  downtown.  If we don't check them out, then we're hitting the cinema for some celluloid escapism.  Question of the day:  which is better, tai chi or chai tea?

      Struck by the realization that my life has been out of balance not the way typical of most people (too much work & stress and not enough bliss) but just the opposite:  years of pursuing my dreams & following my bliss but not enough pragmatism & practicality when it comes to work or a career.  Education-wise, I’ve perfected my mind in interdisciplinarity, but my mind has not been disciplined within any one discipline.  I have breadth but no depth.  Shayne’s analogy about jumping into a new pursuit with both feet but ending up merely running across the surface, only getting her toes wet, on to the next thing was particularly insightful about both herself and me.  I’ve spent years exercising my mind and spirit and body, so I thought that I was fairly balanced.  But the bliss factor far outweighs digging down into the nitty-gritty and immersing myself completely toward the career I long for.  And realizing that my travels have been distractions is certainly a new perspective.  My sister’s signature file—the one that implicates me with every email she sends—includes “Bloom where you are planted.”  Yet I’ve never felt grounded enough to bloom.  (Mind you, I’m only talking about my professional life.  None of these musing are to talk myself into settling for the first crappy job that comes along:  I already have the job I want for now.)  It’s just that I’m beginning to see that along the way, I’ve neglected some of the basic steps that will lead me to the career I want.  So, it’s time I step back, perhaps even take a couple of steps backwards, and make sure that I’m as grounded as I can be professionally before jumping headlong into the next phase.  To celebrate the summer solstice, Stephen, Kris, Theo & I had a picnic at White Rock Lake.  It was wonderful.

      Dear all who happen to spend your hours at work perusing my little corner of cyberspace:  I would like to acknowledge your presence (or the always already absence of your presence) in my life by building a page with photos and/or brief bios of you who read this blog.  So, if you are game, please send me a snapshot (or otherwise staged photo) and some (kind) words about yourself.  Thanks for playing.  And have a safe trip home.  Also, always feel free to comment on anything I've written here.  Two more weeks before I give up my weeknights.  The second summer semester begins on July 6th, and I'm scheduled to teach two courses between 5:30 - 9:40pm, M - Th.  Despite having to figure out a time to eat my supper four nights a week, I'm looking forward to the interaction with my students.  It always makes me a little sharper than I usually am because I prepare so much before I get to campus.  My main concern now is that I get most of my tasks done before class begins, including the release of my second CD and a few applications that need to be prepared.  Watched   urlLink The 24th Day   this afternoon.  My only critique is that I wasn't really in the mood to see such a heavy film today.  The acting was good; the script was well written, though a bit claustrophobic; cinematography was nice.  It may have been more appropriately produced as a play.

       Dear Sir or Madam:   Request for Urgent Business Relationship   I am an underemployed intellectual from north Texas, and I have nothing to do with Nigeria.  However, because of my socio-economic background--I was indeed raised on a farm--I am sure I know a Nigerian level of poverty and filth.  For this reason (and many more), I am interested in the importation of goods (bricks of gold) and services (Thai transsexual “relief” massages) into my own Fortress Amerika.  As a member of the ad hoc committee set up by my government-in-self-imposed-exile, I am currently seeking foreign payment accounts with which I will be able to live the life I grew accustomed to while serving my country (as a Little Ambassador) under the auspices of a Fulbright grant.  My request is anchored on my strong desire to establish a lasting relationship with you and your company. I hence solicit your partnership to enable me transfer into your account the said funds. You have been recommended to me in confidence and I was assured of your ability and reliability to prosecute business transactions that require maximum confidentiality.  In other words, send me all your money, you cheap bastards.  Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and guaranteed since the law under which my committee was set up has empowered me to disburse all the funds found to be floating in the redundant account.  I shall commence the transfer of the funds immediately after receive the following information by telefax:   (1) your company's name and full address (2) your banker's name, address, telephone and fax numbers (3) the account number and name of beneficiary.  Thank you, and God bless.    Seth Schiesel’s  urlLink "Turning the Tables on E-Mail Swindlers" ,  NY Times     urlLink Scamorama    urlLink Artists Against 419

      God, how I love it when politicians and their ilk start talking trash.  It's as if they are truly human afterall.  Case in point:  Ron Reagan, a television commentator, has frequently been critical of Bush. In 2000, he criticized Bush in Philadelphia during the Republican convention, which featured a tribute to his father. "What's his accomplishment?" Reagan asked then. "That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?" --from Sheryl Gay Stolberg's  urlLink "Reagans not embracing Bush" ,  NY Times/IHT    "Kinder and gentler than who?" Nancy sniffed after [Bush's] convention acceptance speech. --from Maureen Dowd's  urlLink "Epitaph and Epigone" ,  NY Times   Being sick sucks.  I've had some sort of respiratory infection since Monday evening.  I'm sure the hour of tai chi, weight lifting, and 4-mile jog/walk didn't help, particularly after the shopping spree with Pablo on Cedar Springs, and driving to Las Colinas in the afternoon/rush-hour heat with no air conditioning.  Yesterday I slept most of the day away, but today I feel much better but still feverish.

      After spending a couple of hours last night preparing documents to send to London (regarding the great move (or not) this autumn), I ended up on the couch watching the Fleetwood Mac concert on PBS with a double shot of Bushmills single malt Irish whiskey ("aged 10 years")--on the rocks (of course)--with tears in my eyes.   urlLink Stevie Nick 's "Beautiful Child" always does that to me since "I was only 10."  Here's an excerpt:  Sleepless child There is so little time Your eyes say yes But you don't say yes I wish that you were mine  You say it will be harder in the morning I wait for you to say, just go Your hands, held mine so few hours And I'm not a child anymore  I'm tall enough  To reach the stars I'm old enough To love you from afar Too trusting ... yes? But then women usually are  I will do As I'm told Even if I never hold you again Well, that plus the stress of trying to make a decision about London.  After several weeks of bouncing from one extreme (I'm definitely going, come hell or high water) to the other (I am absolutely, most definitely not going), I've settled somewhere in the middle where I'd be happy to go and happy to stay.  And I think that this position is probably more dangerous to my sanity because ultimately I have to make a decision.  But right now I'm thinking I should probably pour another drink.  Instead, it's time to pop a sleeping pill to help battle the nightly insomnia I've suffered from this entire week.  Tomorrow looks busy.   Sigh.   But Saturday morning I'm taking a meditation class at the  urlLink Crow Collection , and I'm looking forward to that.

      Today would be the perfect day to spend in a cafe with strangers, a huge bowl of cafe au lait, and a good book.  But since I'm not in Europe or even Asia, I'm at home, online, listening to the rain drizzle down on the terra cotta planters outside my window, doing my laundry (because it's Tuesday, after all)--but in machines(!) that actually clean AND dry the clothes...--except that the dryer seems to be on its last leg because the clothes are still not dry.  I have about another hour before I head to the studio to have my CD mastered, so I won't be able to head to Nodding Dog till this afternoon, if then.  The question of the day:  if one were to buy  urlLink Lori's car , would the inside smell like her hair?  Any thoughts?  Stumbled upon Andrew Boyd's  urlLink Life's Little Deconstruction Book:  Self-Help for the Post-Hip  last night while walking the aisles of Bookstop.  His web site is equally brilliant.  Two of my favorites:   3. Dip into nihilism.  6. Expose depth as another surface.

        "Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Nothing beside remains.  Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The long and level sands stretch far away.   --from Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ozymandias"    I suspect, however, that he was not very capable of thought.  To think is to forget differences, generalize, make abstractions.   --from Jorge Luis Borges' "Funes the Memorious"  The death of Ronald Reagan has me thinking about my America in the '80s, a world he ruled over yet had no knowledge of.  It's only now at 36 that I can appreciate the ironies upon ironies of his administration:  relentless challenges to Soviet rhetoric and ideology with no clear understanding of his own, certainly no critique of it; virulently anti-big government yet quick to increase military spending at the drop of a hat; and finally, what about AIDS?  What about AIDS?  The Iran/Contra scandal was not the only thing he was "out of the loop" about.  And yet, just as there was little mention of Watergate when the great President Nixon died, we, too, shall speak no ill of the dead.  And America is whole and complete and united and blessed by the Hebrew deity YHWH, whose statues, too, must lie in ruin amidst the sand.  America will share in his great amnesia, and all will be right with the world.  As part of my own most serious (yet somehow sardonic) commemoration, if it were not for Ronald Reagan, I would not have studied Russian in college, lived in and traveled extensively throughout Central/Eastern Europe, become politically involved, nor be currently teaching political science (where I most enjoy teaching Marxist theory).  So let us not forget about what lies beneath those sands:  the underground.

      This afternoon, Stephen & I took the train from the Hampton station to downtown Garland to walk around the historical square even though we were certain nothing would be open.  Nothing was open.  But the trip was fulfilling in that sort of way that getting no fulfillment can be.  The fast came and went.  We ended it a few hours ago--after slightly more than 48 hours of no solid food.  Still not sure of the benefits, particularly after the headaches began this afternoon as we walked around downtown Garland in the heat with nothing to do except board the train back to our side of town.  I certainly do feel a bit more lucid and glad to finally fast after so many years of unquestioningly eating my fill.  My last real fast was at the age of 18, when I abstained from food for four days.  At the end of that time, I had visions and began speaking in tongues.  I pray such conditions don't return.  Perhaps tomorrow I'll break my fast from speaking to people as well:  I need to return several phone calls as well as call several people to arrange things for the next few weeks.  Tomorrow will be a good day for such things.

          Okay, any thoughts on the cover to my next CD, a mini (less than 24 minutes) entitled "Digital Tsar"?  I know the text on the back is impossible to read, but on the actual CD cover at real size, there should be no problem.  By the way, the binary code on the front spells out T-S-E-R-O over and over, the name under which I release dance music.  (The more serious, new age/ambient work is released under my name.)  I'll schedule the studio this week to have it mastered.  I'm looking forward to having another item on the shelves of my sad, little shop.  Stephen talked me into this damn-fool fast this weekend:  I haven't had solid food since yesterday around 5:00 PM.  It's easy to control the body; the difficulty is in controlling the mind and getting it to accept that just because the body is hungry, it doesn't mean you'll be stopping at the next cafe for a bite.  I even started salivating when we drove past a Church's Chicken!  I'm not happy about my stalker from the past year getting my home phone number and leaving messages from a local number.  Get a fucking life, for fuck's sake.  I haven't talked to you in over a year, and I only talked to you twice in my life!  That's what I get for not sleeping with him:  if I would've just fucked him, he'd be long gone by now.

      First, I want to wish a happy birthday to my 17-year-old nephew Tim.  You mean the world to me.  The American Dream baffles me.  How did such a lie become so pervasive around the globe?  The only thing more laughable is the Protestant work ethic brought over on that ship of inbred fools.  If all colonizers are sexual deviants, as Andrei Codrescu claims, then why couldn’t the  good  sexual deviants colonize this lost continent?  Of course, I’d be happy if just one good sexual deviant attempted to plant a flag on my fertile soil.   Sigh.   I have been working so hard these past few days, and I still have so far to go.  Reacquainting myself with my reader & writer selves.  Very pleased with the new CD as well as the cover design.  Filled with anxiety, loneliness, and a bit of boredom, however.  And a strong desire not to talk to anyone, especially those who would sidetrack and/or hijack me and my time.  I’m not looking forward to this weekend even though I should be excited about the several free films that will be shown as part of the  urlLink Asian Film Festival .  Instead, I feel  blech  and want to sleep till Monday.

      If it’s been 15 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, then it’s been 5 years since I was in Beijing, shortly before the 10th anniversary.  Which means it’s been 5 years since I was last in Asia, specifically Japan, my home for 2 years.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I determined that if it were not for the ESL job, leaving Japan would’ve been a mistake, something regrettable.  Now I know that it wasn’t a mistake in the big picture.  But I do miss it sometimes.  Despite the hardships & loneliness, I was able to make it a magical place, especially after meeting Tetsuya & Jihad.  Thankfully, I’m still in touch with Tetsuya after all this time.  But I haven’t heard from Jihad in several months.  Perhaps he’s enjoying the North American dream somewhere in Canada now.  Or maybe he’s still in Damascus.  Who would ever believe there is such a sensitive & sweet boy named Jihad?  ***  It’s always disorienting for me when I visit sites of tragedies:  Tiananmen Square, the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw, Hiroshima.  In some ways, it’s like the feeling I got when I used to stand on the roof of my apartment in Shimonoseki and gaze at the stars:  sheer insignificance.  But this feeling was not defeatist in the least; instead, I felt consumed by something greater than me (history, life, the universe), a part of this vast thing that somehow added significance to my own meager life.  This is also how I feel when I visit my family graves every Memorial Day.

      Tuesday, of course, is laundry day, and laundry day is quite often a time to decode the semantics and syntax of my clothes in an attempt to understand the body beneath them.  After the final two black socks were paired, folded, and placed on the bottom shelf in the closet, I turned to put my underwear on the same shelf.  But there was only one pair:  white Calvin Klein boxer briefs with a snap button to close the fly.  Seven days of laundry easily translates into 7 to 9 shirts, 10 – 15 socks, an old pair of blue jeans, a couple of bandanas, workout shorts, and perhaps some khakis or pants.  But what does it mean when I wear only one pair of underwear per week?  Am I “as free as a bird”?  Why does anyone wear underwear at all?  No, I didn’t wear the same underwear for the past 7 days.  Instead, there was just one day this past week that I wore any underwear.  How many pair of underwear do  you  wear in one week?

      Buzzing from the double soy latte I nursed at Torrefazione as I finished Che's  Motorcycle Diaries .  Raving for the endorphin/adrenaline rush due to caffeine, a hard workout, shitty drivers, an empty stomach, and frustration.  But the banana with a dollop of peanut butter on every bite, the last of the JumBlo bubble gum (red, no less), and the 2nd cup of milk I just slammed should kick in soon, and I'll be back to my dour self.   Boles&#322;aw looks like an orange angel sleeping on the couch as the light through the trees just outside the front window dances on his beautiful face.  If he can get through this day with such a strong sense of ease & peace, then so can I.  Tomorrow morning my tai chi class begins.  I'm looking forward to learning something new as well as practicing it consistently over the next month.  Peaceful thoughts to all who read what hopefully comes across as peaceful thoughts.

      I finally found a personality cult I could join without reservation:&nbsp; Teresa Heinz Kerry’s.&nbsp; Her speech last night at the  urlLink Democratic National Convention  was brilliant and inspired; I even got a bit choked up when she began greeting the crowd in her many languages.&nbsp; Is it possible that we may have a polyglot in the White House again!   On a related note, David Brooks is an uncritical ass.&nbsp; His commentary on  urlLink PBS  throughout the convention has been tedious and insipid.&nbsp; He criticized former President Carter for not specifically addressing “Islamist” terrorism, and his comments after Ms. Kerry’s speech corroborated his lack of critical thinking skills, complaining she did not offer any quirky anecdote about her husband.&nbsp; What it must be like to be an intelligent (and opinionated) woman in this world who can only be read within the confines of her relationship with a man!&nbsp; I concede that the only reason she spoke was because her husband is running for president; however, a big chunk of her speech was clearly about women not being allowed to have their own voices:    “I have a very personal feeling about how special America is, and I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called "opinionated," is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women—who have all earned the right to their opinions—instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are....   For [John], the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength. That is why, as president, my husband will not fear disagreement or dissent. He believes that our voices—yours and mine—must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she.”&nbsp; --Teresa Heinz Kerry Ah, if only she would’ve revealed some little personal tale about John, but in Spanish or French(!) as if to say, “I will speak with my own voice, but you must  SPEAK MY LANGUAGE .”   Richard Clarke’s  urlLink assessment of the 9/11 report  is well argued and insightful, particularly regarding bureaucratic bottlenecks and institutional failures of imagination.  With the convention going on and my teaching till late in the evening, I haven’t had much time to work on other more meaningful and personal things such as this blog.&nbsp; But the summer session ends a week from tomorrow.

      I know that this issue is a bit dated; however, I felt it important enough to bring it up, at least in my little quadrant of cyberspace.&nbsp; I wrote this article while living in Warsaw (spring 2002), and the reason I've been thinking about it lately is because my friends &amp; colleagues in Poland, especially those serving in the  urlLink Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH) , were horribly discriminated against ( urlLink Pride festivities banned in Warsaw ) this spring by not being allowed to have their pride parade.  &nbsp;  If by chance you'd like to put in your 2-cents worth, feel free to send letters to the  urlLink Polish ambassador to the US :&nbsp; His Excellency Przemyslaw Grudzinski, 2640 16th Street NW, Washington DC 20009.    While most citizens of Poland were preparing for the traditional worker’s parade on the first of May, Polish gays and lesbians were busy creating their own tradition:&nbsp; a march and demonstration down the heart of Warsaw.   The rainbow flag replaced the red flags waved by various workers’ groups elsewhere throughout the country.&nbsp; No one, including the organizers, knows why May Day was chosen for the second time as the day to march for gay rights.&nbsp; But even with other parades and other reasons to march, the Parade of Equality drew a crowd of about 500 people.   A parade in Central Europe has little in common with its American version:&nbsp; no floats, no marching bands, and no civic organization members in funny hats.&nbsp; Instead, there were speeches from various organizations such as Lambda Warsaw, the Campaign Against Homophobia, and the local chapter of Amnesty International.   And there were cheerleaders.&nbsp; The Radical Cheerleaders is an ultra-feminist group of punk women growling unwieldy slogans at the crowd.   Despite the overly sentimental “We Are the World” moment—and by ‘”We Are the World” moment’ I mean the point at the end of the parade when the participants were encouraged to hold hands and sing along with the a recording of the U.S.A for Africa anthem—the atmosphere of this event was imbued with significance and solemnity.   Lacking the diversity of various sub-groups within the GLBT spectrum, it would have been easy to confuse this parade with any other demonstration.&nbsp; Even with the banners espousing equality for gays and lesbians and an arc of rainbow-colored balloons, spectators along the parade route had to stop and ask what exactly we were marching for.   The past year has been a tumultuous time for Polish gays and lesbians.&nbsp; Even though homosexuality has been legal for a handful of years, social acceptance in this country that claims to be 98% Catholic is slow—at best—in coming.&nbsp; The recent debate over domestic partnerships has proven disastrous.&nbsp; Even the leading proponents of these civil unions in the Polish Parliament are backing down from sheer frustration with the issue as well as with the people it would help most.   The media does little to help the situation.&nbsp; Reading five different magazine articles about the same issue, one finds the same quotes from the same individuals.&nbsp; It is almost as if there are only a handful of homosexuals in all of Poland.   Homosexuality still has the quality of a freak show here, for unfortunately, à la uncritical media everywhere, those interviewed during the parade were two of the three drag queens in attendance and a man of African decent.&nbsp; And the few protesters along the route from the Copernicus statue to the Castle Square received almost the same amount of coverage as the parade in one televised news report.   Perhaps next year the date will change, making it more aligned with worldwide celebration of gay rights typically held in June.  One of the most basic tenets of democracy is the protection of minorities from the majority because ultimately we all will belong to the minority in time.  &nbsp; On a related note, Alanis Morissette comes out in favor of required reading:   "It [having sexual experiences with a female friend in my 20s] was lovely, I loved it. And while there's part of me that deeply wishes I was hardcore homosexual, unfortunately I feel I am deep down heterosexual. I really think [gay experimentation is] a rite of passage, and I highly recommend it to anybody who's pre-lifelong-commitment. Wouldn't this planet be a different place if all fraternities and macho communities were required to experiment with their sexuality? I think it would be really great; it should be like required reading."  -- Singer/songwriter Alanis Morissette to the Miami gaynewspaper  The Weekly News , May 27.

      It’s good to know the majority of words I’ve misspelled in the recent past have been French, a language I took one class in (no, not one course, but actually a one hour-long class when I was a sophomore in college). I dropped French after the first day and signed up for philosophy instead. (Yeah, that served me well.) As they say in Springfield, “Camus can do, but Sartre is smartre.”   And I may not be able to properly spell  urlLink  ménage à trois   (oh wait, I just did!), but I know what one smells like.... Hee hee! And dear Editor (i.e., Stephen), what other non-Francophone can not only properly spell  pamplemousse  but order a vegetarian pizza in the Grand (Old) Duchy of Luxembourg and a  café au lait  in Montreal without any problem?    Le chat est bleu  right back to you! (That’s the only thing I learned during my French studies. Everything else has been picked up during covert listenings to Pimsleur tapes, a drunken night with Poles at the Noir Désir concert, conversations with pretentious academics &amp; artists, my world(ly) travels, as well as a shared car with a stoned Frenchman on the overnight train from Prague to Warsaw).   Speak my language: Franglais!

      Disturbing trends and tendencies are developing in Fortress Amerika.  There certainly exists a disturbing correlation between the topics of these two articles.  Here is a selection from each:  The Nazis were right in believing that one of the most powerful weapons in a war of ideas is books. And for better or worse, the United States is now in such a war. Without books, we cannot succeed in our current struggle against absolutism and terrorism. The retreat from civic to virtual life is a retreat from engaged democracy, from the principles that we say we want to share with the rest of the world.... So the crisis in reading is a crisis in national politics.    Andrew Solomons'  urlLink The Closing of the American Book ,  NY Times    By requiring foreign journalists to obtain special visas, the United States has aligned itself with the likes of Iran, North Korea and Cuba, places where reporters are treated as dangerous subversives and disseminators of uncomfortable truths.... The USA Patriot Act ... placed antiterrorism measures in a peculiar conceptual proximity to laws supporting the control and removal of undesirable aliens, although with a new emphasis: As dissident writers seem to have disappeared from the public sphere, journalists have become the new subversives, even when they have no agenda at all.    Elena Lappin's  urlLink Keeping America safe from foreign writers ,  IHT  Would it be possible for this great nation to continue by sheer inertia without either the most basic rights currently guaranteed by the Constitution or the minimum of civic participation by its citizens?  To counter the authoritarian orthodoxy, I solemnly swear to read more.  So help me Sartre.  And from outside, in the great, big world, news stories filter in about human goodness:   urlLink Women as peacemakers: from victims to re-builders of society .  This story is one of the UN's  urlLink 10 Stories the World Should Hear More About .

      …or can it really be considered insomnia when I slept for almost 11 hours last night?  I have faith that it will all balance in the end.  So far, my summer courses are going well.  It’s exhausting as hell to be on for almost 70 students (about 35 in each class) for the entire evening, but I’m sure to value the experience.  It’s truly amazing that there are no students I flat out dislike from the start!  Last weekend was blissful, spending time with Stephen.  He took off work Friday, so we exercised at the Y, and then went rollerblading at White Rock Lake in the afternoon.  Saturday we watched the fireworks in Addison with his family and Kris; then afterwards, we & Kris sat in her backyard solving all the world’s problems around the chiminea.  Sunday we drove out to east Texas to have a Fourth of July cookout with my sister and brother-in-law.  Spent a huge chunk of the day out there watching the horses & cows and playing with her huge dogs.  I ended up smashing my hand on a rusty gate, and I’ve been wearing a bandage since.  Monday we finally caught  urlLink  Godzilla   at the Angelika—the original Japanese version with subtitles.  Despite seeing the string move Godzilla’s tail and the miniature trains & cars, the film was brilliant in critiquing nuclear weapons as well as indicting those tendencies in man that are more primitive than a creature from the Jurassic period.  Watching Tokyo being destroyed by the monster’s radioactive fire breath was surreal after recently watching   urlLink The Fog of War   that showed actual footage of America’s firebombing campaign in Tokyo (in which a mere 100,000 Japanese were burned alive).  Things like that are hard to bear.  And what were the Japanese who participated in the filming of this movie in 1954 thinking, having survived that holocaust just a few years earlier?  Alas, I can’t answer all questions tonight, so I will now return to bed.  But, ah … more terrible math to make me jolt upright if I do doze off.

      Keeping inside from the heat as I prep for my two night courses (5:30 – 9:40pm Monday – Thursday), I wonder just what is going on out there, where (post) post-modern existentialists wear Chanel and drink lattes and I have to set up group email accounts for my 70 students so as not to “lose” them over the next five weeks.  “Give me Chanel (and a double soy latte), or give me death,” he sneered through the windows of his frozen igloo, surrounded by cats and (dust) bunnies.  Perhaps I’ll be able to poke my head out again soon.  If not, then we shall meet again in August….  Until then, keep the  urlLink Maureen Dowd  coming!

      I found the above phrase used in an online personal ad today. I think I need to meet this person. How does he know I'd hear music at my gym? Why does he insist I read scary books? It's all a sweet, sweet mystery.  Reminds me of a cookie Stephen brought to me a few weeks ago: Hippo Vanilla Butter Sugar Cookie. There is just nothing wrong with those words strung together like sweet, sweet pearls!  Submitted grades this morning after spending a couple of hours grading exams. This summer semester is finally over. And I accepted two humanities classes for the autumn term in addition to my two government courses.  Tomorrow morning we leave for San Antonio to visit Sonia, whom I haven't seen in four years.
