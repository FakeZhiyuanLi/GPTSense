						    I thought I'd start with a brief blurb about myself, in case other netizens actually stumble across my blog in the future.  My name is Jenni A.M. Merrifield and I currently work for  urlLink Microsoft  as a  urlLink User Experience Program Manager  on the TrustBridge team in the  urlLink Windows Core Security  group. When I can actually eek some spare time out of my week, I love to read (almost any genre, but with a definite preference for  urlLink science fiction and fantasy ), I regularly DM and play in FRPGs (mostly  urlLink D&amp;D v3e5 ), and dabble in web site design for fun and (occasional) profit.  I originally hail from the land of the Great White Northâ€”Canada, that is. I moved to the  urlLink Redmond / urlLink Seattle , WA area from the  urlLink Vancouver, BC  area in August of 2001. I currently live just south of a small city called  urlLink Mill Creek  (north west of Seattle, WA), with my husband, Ron, and 5 year old son, Nathan.  On the career front, I have almost seven years of industry experience in the field of client/server application User Experience. Prior to my recent move to the Windows Core Security "TrustBridge" team (I joined them Feb 16, 2004) I was with the  urlLink Content Management Server  team in the Windows Server System group for almost three years and, before that, I worked for NCompass Labs, Inc. (the company which developed the content management application "Resolution" which would eventually become Microsoft Content Managment Server when NCompass was acquired by Microsoft in May 2001) for four years.  Finally, before I joined NCompass Labs in June of 1997 I was at university for 11 years, having completed two separate undergraduate degrees: a Bachelor of Arts majoring in  urlLink Classical Studies  (The art, history, architecture and archaeology of Ancient Rome and Greece) from the  urlLink University of British Columbia  and a Bachelor of Applied Science majoring in  urlLink Computer Engineering  (focus on ergonomics and user experience) from  urlLink Simon Fraser University .  And that's the scoop on who I am and what I'm about. :-)

						    Well, I've finally gone and done it - created my very own Blog. But now I need to go away and think about exactly what interesting or amusing information I should actually post.  In the meantime, if you're a Fantasy fiction and/or FRPG fan, check out this  awesome  story based on a high level Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3e campaign:  urlLink Lady Despina's Virtue .   strawberryJAMM
