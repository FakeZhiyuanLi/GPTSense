       During the course of the last few days, I"ve discovered that people do not liked to be talked to or harassed, stalked- if you prefer, too much. They just don't like it. So, I've made a concession to myself to do as much stalking, harassing, and reticulating as can be done by one person over the internet. The way I figure it, just reading what goes on in peoples' lives is interesting for a while, but the persuit of pissing people off is much more worthy.       In other news, Happy Birthday to Drew, even though he doesn't read this; drop him a card at   urlLink  lknessm@aol.com   . Wish him a happy birthday and make someone's life just that much better.             [seacrest out]

       Welcome to the Post of Joe; the first ever "Official" post on this blog. Nothing much makes it official, just that I am writing from work, and that's official.  Nothing is much happening with me. Nothing ever happens with me. I'm just uninteresting.  And tell me this- what's with every adult I meet thinking that they can be my mentor? Seriously, everyone that hears that I don't do homework and that I'm fighting to get back in school takes me aside and gives me "their advice". Which, in reality is the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, etc., again. I know that they have all of the greatest intentions, but the next time someone does it, I'ma go all Tia Vang on their ass and beat them into a bloody pulp, samurai style.  That about does it for me, until I go home tonight and decide that I'm bored, so I'll probly post again.  Because I know you all want me to.    [seacrest out]

       I'm like Dr. Suess, but more alive and less good at ryming.      And no, I don't write poetry that get's posted on me little sighty here.      I think I've pretty much got nothing to write about- I went to work this morning, delivered 80 tires to Menominee, went back to the house of wares, and updated pricing all afternoon. Interesting shit, really. I think I promised Jordan a personalized post, but I don't think she wants me to; and anyway, I really don't know anything about url's or anything that's needed to do actual cool shit here.      So until this dies or I show some signs of interest, this is the format, style, and way the blog will be forever.      And ever.       Amen.              [seacrest out]

         Have you ever wondered when you would be promoted to the rank of adult? I have. And then I thought that I was. But then, as soon as it was "given", it was taken away...      Kudos to Jordan-            [seacrest out]

        Ahh, what a wonderful day.  To awaken to the sounds of birds chirping and cows mooing, there's nothing like it.       I did learn something today though- it seems as though every friend I have that has a problem thinks that it is the end of the world.  And then, I get all worried and try to think of things I can do to help- and the next day, the problem's over.  Everything's set up the way it should be.  I'm not needed.       As through this observation, I've decided that before anybody asks someone else for advice, they already know the answers they ask for, they already know what they're going to do.  All they really want is someone to give them sympathy.  I hate that.  That's why I rant in the first place. This is the problem that's caused all of the problems in my life.  I am the walrus- coo coo ca choo.       Maybe not, but something's got to be to blame.       I need a hug.                   [seacrest out]

       It is a beautiful day today in Green Bay, by the way, hey!&nbsp; As I look out the window, I see a golden hued sunset, with the low green treeline swaying softly with the wind.&nbsp; The sound of grasshoppers, birds, cows, all&nbsp;mixed together to make one harmonious whole.&nbsp; But the outside is for people who go,&nbsp; there.&nbsp; People who go outside don't have to do stuff, otherwise they'd be doing it inside, like the rest of us; sitting on our dead asses in an un-air conditioned shack typing posts for the blog that they tend night and day.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I wish I had a blog.&nbsp; To write stuff down in.&nbsp; And stuff.&nbsp;Inside; the house.&nbsp; I'ma go and adjust myself.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   [seacrest out]

       I really wish I had a more interesting life. But I don’t.     Sometime in this next week I have to go in front of the Notre Dame disciplinary council and plead my case to be let back into school. I’m 5.5 credits behind my class, but I have a plan that will allow me to finish in the next two years [with my class].  In the first semester of my junior year [next year], I will get to take the afternoons off, filling the credit space with online classes and independent study with two teachers of my choice. Both of the teachers that were my first choices for independent study agreed, so I’ll make up sophomore english and second semester math with my favorite teachers.     For the rest of it, I’ll pretty much have to work my ass off, but since I don’t want to fall behind my class, I don’t really have any other choice. I’ve got the support of the new principal [for those of you who don’t know, the old one was fired after bogus accusations of sexual abuse that were from 25 years ago were brought up], and the two teachers who are going to do independent study with me both think the plan is good. The only variables are from the vice principal, a young ex-army pain in the ass who was cool until he got the vice principal job and now goes around making everyone’s day hell, and the disciplinary board [I don’t know who’s on it this year, but I have a pretty good relationship with most of the teachers in the school (except of course those I’ve already had)].     I thought this was all in the bag until my mother got all motherish and told me she didn’t think it would work because none of the classes would "spark my interest" and I would just give up after a few weeks. To which I think- that’s probably true, but I’m just too happy to think that way. Kudos to me. I’m just so super.      &nbsp;   [seacrest out]

       I wonder if everyone has as many problems with people as I do. I know that everyone complains about their parents, but I have a question for you: are your problems with yours constant?    My problems just don’t look as bad on paper as most peoples’. You really have to be there to understand. I just really rub them the wrong way- and not like the normal ways that you’d think. I really rub them the wrong way.    I get accused for every little thing that goes wrong that I can even remotely be blamed for in a serious way. One prime example is the post of a few days ago where I laid out in so many words my problem with being accused of stealing money from the family business. That could have been a simple thing, but instead, I have talked to my dad less than usual, and I haven’t had a conversation with him about something other than my school issues in as long as I can remember.     Today, my mom and sister went to church to do their choir thing; and Mike, Tia, and Mike’s brother Alex came over to wait for them to get home so that I could leave with them. Me and Mike agreed that it would be wisest for them not to be sitting in the driveway when my mom got home. They left to get food [and Senor Pipo II], and ran into my mom at the grocery store.  I asked her, since they had been waiting now for 2 hours for me, if I could go with them; instead, she told me that since I "was with them the entire time" she was at chuch, that I couldn’t leave. Seriously- what a bitch. I haven’t been able to do anything with anybody in about three weeks, and before that, the only people I could see were the ones that I ran off with after being told not to, and coming home to all sorts of interesting things.     &nbsp;  I can’t believe that at this point your’e still listening to me. I wouldn’t be.  &nbsp;    &nbsp; [seacrest out]

       As I was taking stock in my life the other hour, I thought that the one thing I really am in need of is a good hobby. Some people have drugs or art, music or bondage, but I don't really have anything.    &nbsp;  I was thinking of catfishing. But that's weird, and catfish scare me.&nbsp; I hate them because they can grow whiskers, and&nbsp;I can't.    &nbsp;  I don't have a car, and going out for a liscence is too much work, so I think my new hobby should revolve around the computer. Or mining.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  [seacrest out]

        Well,  apparently my self-pity about how much my parents hate me is not going to go well with you people.&nbsp; Fine then.&nbsp; My life sucks in other ways- and instead of complaining, like some other people in their unread blogs, I'll take a different angle.     &nbsp;   My new angle: my life is great. I'm super.&nbsp; Big smiles. LOL.&nbsp; My new screen name will be "SummerGrl272".&nbsp; Is this what you want?&nbsp; I didn't think so.&nbsp; My entire reason for being is to make myself look miserable and to bring others down with me [right mike?]. So that's what I'm going to do, lie to you about how much of an ass I am, and stuff.     &nbsp;   I kind of forgot what I was ranting about there, so I'll stop.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   [seacrest out]

       My family is usually pretty good about respecting each others' space and giving each other the benefit of the doubt; but apparently that is done now. My mom is missing 3 envelopes of start cash for one of the shops, equaling $685, and she claims it was missing out of the house, which only leaves me and my sister.&nbsp; I am waiting for a $400 paycheck from her, so, why would I steal it?&nbsp; My sister didn't do it because not only was she deadpan when she told me she didn't, but she doesn't need money for pretty much anything, and if she does, she'll come straight to me to ask.     &nbsp;   So now I get bad looks from my parents, and when I tell them I didn't take any money, my dad usually yells "bullshit!" in a loud and resounding voice.&nbsp; Now I'm sitting waiting at home, for, something to wait for.     &nbsp;   [seacrest out]

        I've decided that having a blog with no extras is equivalent to having no blog at all.&nbsp; So, I am currently downloading "Picasa" which will apparently allow me to send pictures to myself, so in about 5 minutes, I'll have a genuine picture of myself on the website that only I will read.&nbsp; How cool is that?&nbsp; I think it's pretty cool.     &nbsp;   It sounds cool.     &nbsp;   Thank you.     &nbsp;   You're welcome.      &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Well, it looks like I'm not going to Notre Dame this year. *sheds tear* But hell, you know me, I'ma still try getting in.      The only reason that it's probable that I won't go there is because the vice principal is doing all that he can to keep me out. This would piss me off, but I would probly do the same thing to keep me out of the school. I know I'm an ass. And you should too.      Other than that, I just got  Led Zeppelin II , which pretty seriously kicks ass, and I ordered  Friendly People  by Guttermouth; so I'm in a good mood. And you should be too.      I'm way behind at work with no end in sight, so that's good.      Ask me about my plans this weekend at  urlLink LittleBrother_49@hotmail.com  if you care, and you're not my mother. I don't think she should know. Not that it's bad though. I'ma just go to church and some other things that you have to inquire about inside. If you're not my mother.      ^that whole thing mad sense in my head, I swear it did...^      Other than what I've already told you, there's nothing going on in my life. Other than sex, drugs, and the underage consumption of malt liquor beverages at an unhealthy rate. Well, one of those things... ^.^    V      ^wow, I did a thing with characters that resembles a smiling face with a v-mouth. yay! well, the mouth's screwed up, but you'll live

       Apparently, I think everyone is out to get me. But just because I do, it doesn't mean that they're not. So there. What? Word.      In other, more relevant news- Mike's birthday is on Wednesday next week, and for all of you who didn't send happy tidings to Drew on his shout-out, shame on you, and now do this one:   urlLink  nepenthic4@hotmail.com    . Do it, or I will find you. And there will be pain. Lots of pain. And if I can figure out what it is, I'll fong you. And I'll fong you good. So do it. Do it now.      And now for the real news:   -Tia doesn't know where she's going for school. She's enrolled at Oshkosh but doesn't have a dorm room yet, and she wants to go to UWGB but doesn't have her shit straight yet. She promised me she'd get her shit together- but you can never be sure with those little toyota driving types...   -Paul is doing stuff that's really important and relevant that I don't understand. Ask him.   -Mike's day of birth is on Wednesday, if you already forgot the new hole I ripped you for the last one; and I guess he's just as Mike-ish as ever.   -Meishi's back in school in North Carolina. Yay.   -Band camp (a weeklong fun-fest) starts tommorow. I don't have to go, but I will anyway. I mean, come on, it's Band Camp. Wouldn't you go too?   -My dad's new name is vagina-forehead. One of the technicians at the shop dropped a fender on his head and left a scar in the shape of a vagina on his head. A 12 year old came up with vagina forehead. What a kid. I love kids.   -My sister ordered me Army of Darkness for my birthday (Sept. 4 for all of you insensitive types who don't bother to get that information from me). So I'll be secluded for a while while I watch that about 72 times. A week. For 3 weeks.       This post is already too long with nothing in it meaningful or about me. Damn. I guess you'll just have to wait until next time...    This conludes our broadcast hour...         [seacrest out]

       I dont' know where I'm going for school.    I don't know if I have to pay for school wherever I go.   I don't know where any of my friends are or how they are doing.   I don't know what the hell Meishi was thinking taking Brian back.   I don't know what to say on my own damn blog.      I do know that I'm purely amazing though. And that's all that matters.      It looks like I'll be pulling off another 56 hour work week while some people in N.C. go to school to screw around. Asses.      I've got so much work to do that is really important and should have been done so long ago- I think I've probly cost my parents a bit of money with some of the stuff, and I still don't know what I'ma do for school. Notre Dame is a great school. I really want to go back; but I really, really, really, really, pissed that vice principal off. I think the guy is going so far as to be un-Christian about it! I know!, that bad!  Que ouror!      And my one pair of chucks that fits is falling apart! It's terrible- I don't have any other shoes! The horror!    On the brighter side of things, it is brighter.

      It is awfully nice to be loved.  But being loved, doesn't stop the system from sucking. So the system needs to get its head out of its butt and help people who need helping. In general, it needs to stop being such a beaver's gallbladder.  Thank you.  ~Meishi (the all-together one)  (That one's a shot at the system for Fred. ^_^)

       Paulie says the nicest things for someone who is always having a depression attack and a fight with a girl...      Anywho, I took the day off of work- allowing me to put on a skirt and play with a sword outside.  You think it's just something stupid I say, but it's not. I went outside in a white petticoat and swung a big sword at really big thickets out in the field; then, the neighboors saw me, and I felt really stupid- but I kept doing it anyway. Life is grand.      Other than that, I'm still being stalled by Senor Vice Principal Assholio, and now we're down to two weeks left in the summer. Tell me, if NDA doesn't let me back in, where the hell do I enroll this late in the summer?      People are just assholes.  Except for me, I'm just a nice guy.      I started my first online class the other day; I got kicked out of health freshman year and had to retake it somehow, and I chose the online school deal.  I finished the course in about 5 hours. It was great.      But it really was the only highlight of my week.      I get to go school clothes shopping sometime in the near future. It'll be great, I love shopping like a woman. A blonde woman.

       This whole blog thing used to be super interesting, the highlight of one night and a huge interest for the weeks to come. And now it's not. But I still have to post on it, otherwise people start to bitch and moan. Or, one particular person does, but she's gone for the week.      Anywho, the vice principal is still putting of my meeting with the board to get let back into school. What a bitch. I mean it. This guy's just a complete ass.    This plan would let me take half days for my whole junior year- and that just plain rules! In fact, it rules so much that it doesn't blow nuts! Yay.      Do you know what this means? It means stuff! That's what! No, it's super important, but it's not really what you people want to hear about. You like sex, drugs, and violence; so, from now on, i'ma right about the evils of the world instead of the mundane happenings of my own pathetic life.      It's gonna be cool.

       Yesterday, my parents took all of us kids, and an extra 4-year old up north to play in the water and spend some quality time together. They rented me a little boat with an outboard motor; with which I rode around creating general havoc- running through flocks of birds on the lake, crashing into islands (on accident of course), creating wakes in the "No Wakes" zone, you know, really sick shit.   And now, I sit doing repetitive stuff for the house of wares on my saturday, working to pay off the $4000 I need for school next year. I already have about $700 saved for the initial deposit, and the other $300 or so I can make up in a week or so. My anti-drug: p-o-o-r-n-e-s-s.   Meishi broke up with her online boyfriend of 2 years I do believe- sad story.   Mike and Tia are ghetto-er than ever, with Alex and Eric playing tag-along.   Paulie is in hiding somewhere in the Pantanal.   Liz is sleeping somewhere.   I am kneeling in front of my shrine to the Holy Mary, going over the rosary for the 17th time this morning, reading the bible, and praying for God to give me the strength to conquer all of the evils in the world.   I am the walrus, coo coo ca choo.      [seacrest out]

       Well, a forced one, at that.  So, I was told by my parents that if they caught me with any drugs or any suspicious phone calls, they would beat me within an inch of my life.  At least, that's what I got out of it.      But it's hard, because I have to pay off all of the catholic school now, and it's about 4 grand a year,  so, tell me- how do they think i'm ever going to pay that off making $6 an hour?  But I guess I'll figure it out somehow; I'm a good boy now.      In other news, I've decided that I need a girlfriend of some sort, so now I have to get off my ass, I suppose.  It just gets lonely sometimes... Well, a little, I guess.   It just looks like all of the rest of you get into a good argument with your other half every few days, and I need the excitement.

          For all my talk of everyone else's lives being blown out of proportion, I think that mine is probobly the most dramatic.        Last night, my parents graced me with something I hadn't had in a while- freedom.  Yes, I was let out of my metaphysical prison.     All of my intentions were bad from the start, I notice looking back.  I sat in a room with some people to be left unnamed because as far as I know, my parents found this blog; and "adjusted" my mind for a few hours, then I went back to the warehouse, at the time that I was supposed to be back, with the cell phone that I was supposed to have, and my mom immediately gave me the once-over, coming up with the idea that I was messed up.  I was. So, yes, I told her that I was as soon as she asked.     My dad did the whole expected invasion of privacy thing and looked through my cd case that was bulging out from the center, finding a pack of Salem's.  Wow, that was dumb.     So the shit hits the fan, and there is much yelling and gnashing of teeth.  And here I am, unscathed as far as the personage goes, but scarred emotionally.       I need another hug.
