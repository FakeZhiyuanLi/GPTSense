      well...S is the leader of this old folks home events. However she didn't do anything and Y and i had to be the leader of this event. We racking our brains of what games can the old folks play. When Y called my teacher and told her what would happen if S is angry, She said too bad , i totally got a shock but M doesn't who i told him what happen. He think it is naturally.

      collecting report book is my worse day. well ... i done pretty well for all subjects expect for english. Why do parents have to compare us with other ppl child,  with my hatred friend, J. I feel like telling them, fine fine, she is so great so what, then ask her to be her child. I nowadays would rather hang out as late as i can or cope in my room. My family doesn't understand me abit. LIKE to compare! Fine! I also can compare our parents! FREAK ! why can't they understand... i have stress too! i have tons of tuictions, tons of school stuff, and dancing class which i enjoy the most yet. I decided... COPE MYSELF. THEY don't understand abit. Not at all...
