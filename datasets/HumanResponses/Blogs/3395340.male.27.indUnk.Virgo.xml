      I’m not going to post the results this time as it's getting way too depressing. But here is a brief rundown of what happened in week 2.   Game1  This was a really good start, and we all thought this might be it. We were holding them off and had a couple of half decent chances. But we let in a couple of silly and didn't manage to turn any chances into goals.   Game 2  We decided to try a different strategy this game. The 1-2-1 line up was used with a static defence and covering midfield with a loan striker hopefully slotting in goal after goal. We looked dangerous in places but possibly weren't quick enough at covering and ended the game a few goals down with none in our favour.   Game 3  We got whipped by one of the top teams, but didn't concede as many goals as one of the other teams that night (ll) but I have managed to block how many we did let in and it will never be written by my hand. We again scored NO goals, getting to be a bit of a habit that.  More work is still needed but i still think we will make a good team. We still have some great players and there are new ones turning up every week.

      Lads, we need uniforms (British translation = kit) if we seriously want to compete. I'll put in the order for the team. Hopefully they'll be ready for our next game.

      First thing is first. A big thank you to everyone that made it last night, we had a squad of 8, which is exactly what we need every week to give us options and rest tired legs when needed (and did we need resting ;). So again a big thanks to the first squad;   	 Robert Spicer  	 Ben Casey  	 Nick Clement  	 Ben Hutchins  	 Martin Lee  	 Stuart Wakeman  	 Tony Susi  	 Rob Smiley    Now for the bad news. To follow are the results and a quick run down of how our first games went;  Game 1  RR 0 - Edwin Coe 3  Our first outing was always going to be tough, we never played as a team and only half the team new each other (a few more beers and we might get there). Because of our lack of experience we didn't really have any structure or play as a team. Good effort by all, but we just weren't organised yet. A big shout has to go out to Ben Casey, who is our first casualty and was carted off with a buggered ankle after a good effort in defence, let's hope he's all fit and well next week.  Game 2  RR 0 - LCL Revolution 4  These guys were 2nd top after the first week so we new it was gonna be tough. We put in a valiant performance and played much better as a unit and caused them some real trouble in the first 5 minutes. Holding them off and creating some half decent chances. We let in a couple of silly goals and ended the game a respectable (for our second game) 2 goals down.  Game 3  RR 0 - BOB 5  Just above us in the league this was effectively a six pointer so it would have been great to win this one but allas it is possibly still too early to expect a victory. We continued our form from the second game and put in a real effort and managed keep men marked and find space when we had play. Again a couple of silly chance and they got the lead on us. But we learnt a lot and made some real progress. But shock of shocks we scored a GOAL, woohoo I hear you cry, but a quick look at the score line will have you back in your seat and wipe the smile off you face, Nick, in an attempt at a defensive block scored a corker in the bottom right hand corner of our own goal.  All in all a learning experience and a good run out for our first attempt playing together. We were always going to struggle at first, a lot of these teams have been playing together for ages. It might take a few weeks to gel but I reckon we have the players to cause some real havok over the next few weeks.

      RR 1 - Kevin Costner 2 RR 1 - Cranium Cats 4 RR 0 - Booze Cruzerios 4  We had a team of only five again this week so the first thing is a huge thanks to all that turned up this week.  First game was a positive start and we looked like we were capable of so much more and I think we scared 7th place Costner who thought it was an easy fixture against the bottom team. Nice effort by Spicer, who got our only goal and a great job by Kev in defense.  Cranium Cats are 2nd in the league and deserve to be there. The strategy that worked so well last week and in this weeks first game let us down here, our modular approach was too transparent for these guys and once they found the back of the net they were all over us like a rash. Still if you look back to earlier in the league we might well have lost 7,8,8 or even 10 nil against a side like this so there has been improvement. Spicer again scored the token goal.  The game against Cranium kind of knocked the stuffing out of us a bit and affected the teams moral in this game. We just weren't in it to win it, and the score line showed it. We had no spark and let a few silly goals in. On a better day we may have given them a run for there money.

      We chated a couple of weeks ago about getting lashed at the end of our highly educational first run at a league. Any ideas on places.  The Thursday after our last game seems like a good time, that's Thursday July 15.

      OK fellas the next league starts in August. This is a chance for us to join a lower league and play some teams a little closer to our level. We would have a far greater chance of winning games and may even work our way up to the Weds Premier in time.  We can either do it with sponsorship or by gathering money off of everyone over the next few weeks. maybe £5 a week may get us started? Hopefully Kev/Stu/Spicer can organise something through SCEE, but let's start talking about alternatives in case this doesn't come off.

      Who is up for an organised weekly training session, possibly on Tuesdays so we can get ourselves organised and even a bit fitter before our Wednesday games?  I propose Vauxhall gardens as there is ample room and even a decent redgrar pitch if we can get there quick enoough.

      Another annoying week. The team is still on the up believe it or not. Putting in a couple of really good performances and I think getting close to finding a really good format. What connected all of these score lines was the fact that we defended really well up until the first goal went in and then we lost our structure and started leaving holes all over the place. This could be down to fitness or discipline but it is something that we need to sort out if we are to start getting some deserved points.  kevin Costner 5 - Roman's Rejects 2 (Spicer, Wakeman)  Booze Cruzeiros 6 - RR 1 (remind me)  Cranium Cats 7 - RR 0  Won't go into details only to say that we gave it our best but lost heart as the night went on, but we are still scoring goals and matched last weeks total. Now if we can only keep our structure, keep in position and defend well, whilst getting a few more in the back of the net, the points are bound to start coming our way.  Just remember guys that we are playing with the top boys here when we should probably be playing in the 1st ot 2nd devisions. This does not mean that we can not upset the applecart though, i heard one of the teams this week smarting about how many goals they thought they were going to put past us, as a matter of pride we need to start proving these assholes wrong ;)  I'm off to Sicily on Monday so expect an email from Mr Roberto Spicer on Monday asking for your support next week and please reply to him as swiftly as possble so he can get an idea of what sort of team we have next week. I also have some fairly ropey team pics to post up and will do so when i have some time so watch this space.  Cheers.

      Yes boys we are definitely on the up. We have been getting better every week and this week was no exception.  Game 1  5-0  yet another score  line that does not represent the effort that went in from the Rejects. We fought like bastards in this game but just couldn’t keep the goals out despite the best efforts of mr Susi’s surprise appearance in goal. We were creating chances though and had at least 4 clear shots on goal.  Game 2  3(2)-1 (Smyth) Up against top of the table SW magazine we new it was gonna be a hard one but after the defeat of the last game we came out in fighting spirit but to be honest we all expected the worst. Again we fought hard and managed to hold them off pretty well, they managed to get one in the first 5 minutes.  But like lightning we retaliated and got one back at 1-1 we held them up until the last minutes. Another goal went against us with just 3 minutes to go, but they later admitted that it had gone through the side netting (we wait and see if the score accounts for this). So effectively still 1-1 we hold on till the last minute where they manage to squeeze one past not so quiet American in goal. Almost got a Point from playing against the top team, bloody hell how can we top this…  Game 3  2-2 (Smyth, Lee) This was a cracker. Playing against GAM who were in mid table obscurity and obviously thought they should be higher. This was probably the most physical game we have played to date. And we rose to the challenge, cracking in not one but two goals and believe me they were not happy. We kept it up and defended magnificently letting in one goal about half way through. We got away with a few lucky scrapes, they were hitting posts left right and centre, but we still held that 2-1 lead. We had held them right up to the final seconds when a slight lapse in concentration on my part (sorry lads) let a little whipper snapper round the back from a corner to score a goal with, would you believe it, the very last kick of the ball! Lads we were seconds away from our first victory. But hey we scraped a draw and our first points on the board.

      Come on lads - Now we can start playing. I've bagged us some footy shirts so we don't need to look like the team who just strolled in off the streets. The only thing is.... we need to start playing like a real team. Looks like we've got 6 players tonight and it's a late one because our last game is at 9.45. I'll bring the new kit along, all you need to do in return is play like you've never played before. I think we've got some pretty decent players now - we just need to gel.   Chase every ball and earn every touch. Damage limitation is not a mentality, winning is.  see you later chaps

       True to form the last week was just as bad as all that went before it, a couple of losses, we played OK but there are no prizes for coming last or are there&hellip;      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     &nbsp;       &hellip;well boys all the embarrasment was worth it after all. Because of the sheer bloody mindedness and some would say stupidity of turning up every week for a sound thrashing by all comers, we were awarded the award for most Sportmanly team.   I can honestly say it's been emotional. Those emotions are usually anger, dissapointment, embaressment or pain, but still emotional. I hope that everyone is out on the lash next Wednesday, details to follow, but I think Clem has a few ideas if you know what I mean!   Until next time

      We got very wet and got beat again.  5-2 DECHERT (a dribble) (Hutch,Lee) 4-1 REAL MADRASS (a downpour) (Hutch) 4-0 LUCKY MONKEYS (torrential) ()  Man of the match may as well be Hutch this week, seeing as he whinged the least and scored 2 goals. Full effort to all who turned up, it was a pretty horrible evening. The last game was just insane, playing footy in torrential rain, with lightning as a back drop, brilliant :)  Better luck next week boys.
