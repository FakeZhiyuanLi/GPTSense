      Love is an exception.  Ally McBeal said it best, “it’s funny how we set qualifications got the right person to love while at the back of our minds we know that the person we truly love will always be an exception.”  Ally McBeal’s saying applies to me even if I never really had set qualifications. As long as they’re not too ugly and have a full set of teeth, any guy with a good heart will pass. Truth is, my list is just the opposite. I have ideas on what I don’t want my man to be. The only problem is, I don’t really know it until it is presented to me.  My List of NOTs in a lover 1-liar 2-cheater/womanizer 3-pussy-collector 4-pimp/man hoe/man slut 5-dirty (ie. no STDs, dirty dresser) 6-unnecessarily keep secrets 7-have liabilities (ie. children) 8-butt ugly 9-conceited up the ass 10-gay or more girly than I am  Here’s my exception: Mr. Rico Carlo. He does not necessarily cover every NOTs that I have listed above, but he’s checked out with most of them. Okay, he’s got all of them maybe with an exception of one or two. For example, he thinks he’s so cute but he really covers #8 on my list. I’m just playing. Seriously though, I feel that every guy just about checks out number 9 on my list. In one form or another, guys can be conceited up the ass. It no longer annoys me as much as it makes me laugh. They can be so smug, it’s ridiculous!  Day by day I find out certain things about my husband that I don’t approve of. Maybe it’s our difference in lifestyle and up bringing that makes it hard for me to accept these things about him. But I have learned to get over it and deal with it by not letting it get to me too much. In contrast to my past relationship, I have learned to ease up a bit and be a bit more understanding about the situation. Besides, these are from his past which happened before he even met me. It’s reassuring to realize the fact that despite of what he had to choose from, he picked me. It makes me feel real special while at the same time, holding judgment about the real reason behind why he chose to pursue this lifestyle and not the one he so enjoyed before we met. I would not dwell on it so much, but I would like to know.  It’s a little hard to believe that a person can just easily drop something to pursue another especially when it involves giving up things that they so enjoyed or loved. Again, learning from a past relationship, I have learned to trust my hubby with his conscious decision to pursue life with me.  I have learned to accept these NOTs about my husband that I never would have even given a second chance to if it was anyone else. Learning from past relationships, communication is key even if I find out something I don’t necessarily like or agree with—especially about his past. As long as his past does not catch up with our present and or affect our future then I don’t see it as a big problem. I worry less now that I have come to accept that past is past. One rule he and I have to abide with is to not let our past get to us. I struggle sometimes, but not as bad as losing sleep over it (except maybe for tonight since I’m writing this).  As days pass by and I find out more about my husband, I can’t help but wonder: Have I fallen in love with a stranger? More over, why am I putting up with it? While the answer to the first one might be yes, the latter one has already been answered—because he’s MY exception. He’s my exception not because he’s my husband and I am forced to accept things about him. It is because I love him and it is so easy to just be.  I feel it’s necessary to explain a bit.  He’s a stranger in a sense that we don’t really know much about each other. It’s a little irritating sometimes when I notice annoying nit-picking habit he has over his white/blackheads and pimples. On the contrary, our relationship would be so boring and routine if we were so predictable. So being somewhat of a stranger to one another does not necessarily pose a huge threat to our relationship. We have our whole lifetime to discover one another so why hurry?  Some would think I’m settling or he’s settling for convenience. I can’t speak for him, but I can say so for myself that it is not for convenience. Which woman in their right mind would accept a guy who has liabilities, who one would call a pussy collector or even a man slut? Let alone marry the guy after dating exclusively for less than two months! The most convenient thing to do is to abandon the relationship. Besides, I’m still young, and I’ve got potential. On the one hand, I have known all this about him BEFORE we were officially together and BEFORE I married the guy. Despite of his downsides, he’s got a very rare characteristic in him that I so admire in people: he tells the truth. Even though he tries to hide things to protect me, he eventually tells me anyway—full disclosure. I appreciate that in him, that’s why I trust him. There is no love when there is no trust in the relationship. I thought I could never trust a guy again and he proves me wrong. Albeit that I still have my doubts, in the end of it all I completely trust that I won’t get fucked over. On the other hand, I just may be the kind of woman who isn’t in the right mind because I married a guy who has liabilities, a former pussy collector and man slut. Crazy as I may be, I have no problems with people who do “bad” things according to our puritanist standards as long as they OWN it. One can be as slutty as they can be, but do not be a hypocrite by acting as if one is not when one is confronted about it. We all make conscious choices of how we live our lives—it’s just proper to accept ourselves, too. If not, then consciously change yourself.  30 may 2004 0315a
