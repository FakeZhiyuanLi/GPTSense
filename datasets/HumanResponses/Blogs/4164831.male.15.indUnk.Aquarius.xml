       Dude, what are you trying to do wa? You should post this in the comments section of my weblog while you create your own woi.      Yep, I agree...damn shame that there's no "gay" option for my profile.

        What an exhausting day! Had ROTC for the second time at this new training centre (situated in the middle of nowhere at Don Muang). Had to do 30 pushups when we arrived off our buses, and was forced marched into the centre for about three yards before we were stopped and ordered to do 30 additional pushups---in the middle of the road. As we wearily trudged our way in, the drill instructors ordered us to do pushups again, goddammit.     Started the day off with a uniform-and-equipment check; 95% of the two companies were forced to do "excercises" for any breach of uniform regulations (untight boots, unbuttoned pockets, un-shiny belt buckles, long finger nails, long haircuts, noticeable moustaches, and anything else that one can think of).

       Had the pleasure of meeting Boss and P'Yos today, after school.    A very fun conversation ensued thereafter with Ake, P'Yos, Boss, Kit, Boom, and me. Boss has gotten himself into what appears to be more trouble by enrolling into AP Mathematics as a result of one very ambigious exam, haha.

          I hate Siam. I really, really do hate Siam.     It's  the  centre for Thai pop/teen culture, and it's where your average Thai teenager would go. One of the worst ordeals in life involves walking at  urlLink Siam  during "rush" hours on weekends, where literally hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of self-conscious, pop culture-craving teenagers hang out for no good reason. Just because you take Saturday/Sunday classes around  urlLink Siam  is no excuse to pretentiously crowd around the malls. Well, actually, that's not all that bad as it provides me and my gang some enjoyable people-watching sessions (which also provides a good conversation subject). What bothers me is the ridiculously large number of teens around.

        Was a very tiring day, yesterday. Mad Jan's back in town, and so we set the meeting time at 2:30.

        I'm writing this out of boredom, so bear with me...      Whoa. The newest supplement for that miniature wargames game,  urlLink Flames of War , is out, and, boy, I gotta get it. And, along with the book, comes a whole series of new figure packs to accompany the new Great Patriotic War craze.    I just can't wait to do Stalingrad and, in fact, the entire Eastern Front in 15mm. I know, I know, I have to get 20mm WWII, as well as 10mm Fantasy, 15mm Ancients, and the Physics done, but what can one do when one lives in a society where consumerism is propagandised through the various mediums (in this case, the net), encouraging me to buy more and more?

        Chee's leaving for ISB (that's  the  Internation School of Bangkok, for those who don't know) and, as far as I know, won't be coming back. It's sad really, considering the time she spent here at KUS and the time I spent to get to know her.

        Well, tommorrow's the Queen's birthday, as well as the National Mother's Day (read: no school). So, I've got more or less a whole day to kill, even though there's Physics, English, and Lucy's S.S. waiting to be done.  Had to bring our PE uniforms to change today, as the school had this "Paying Respect to the Portrait of the Queen" ceremony thing at the Akharn Chalerm Prakiert (also universally known as the  Big Building ). You just knew what the whole ceremony was going to be like when we had to stand and sing the national anthem in front of a 9-pixels, fully animated GIF Trairong (the national Thai flag)...

        One of the reasons why Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated was because some Serbian nationalists in Bosnia wanted the place to join with Serbia. In fact, at the first half of the last century, people in the Balkans were fighting because they wanted to form a new, united state (which more or less became Yugoslavia following WWI).   Now, look at the Balkans again, half a century later on. Yugoslavia has, since the fall of communism, been broken up into different little countries through ethnic (and probably nationalistic) strife marked by brutality in the worse sense of the word. And when you think about it, it's actually rather silly, really. Thousands of people dying just to unite each other's countries into a single state, and thousands more dying just to dismember the same old state. It's what I like to call human nature.

        Just saw an ad for  We Were Soldiers , that Nam film starring Mel Gibson. Having watched it once, the ad made me think a little bit, and a question soon popped up in my head.      The Battle of La Drang Valley, where Lt. Col. Hal Moore's (Gibson) 7th Cav held off two whole regiments of the NVA, was pretty much a replay of  Dien Bien Phu , which had taken place a decade earlier in '54.

         It's 22:07, I'm trying to do my Eng essay on a poem by ee cumming, and I'm stuck...       It's interesting, isn't it, that three cities that you'll like to visit in the '70s would be Kabul (with its beautiful hills and its orange trees), Tehran (with the Shah's modern city centre), and Beirut (the Paris of the Mid East). That was in 1975. Look at 2004.

        Here's another poem from Aj. Year. This time, the unfortunate subject for this literary piece is everyone's favorite porn addict and wannabe popular person (not to say that he isn't): Nic     Believe it or not, the pic below is the one on his Smart ID Card...**shudder**

         Well, I'm at school...the Physics still isn't finished **SIGH**     Dammit, and I have a Physics exam today. Will I pass it? Probably not. Better do extra problems from the txtbk then, I suppose. Aowww. It's a tough week, this week. Many praises to the Lord Buddha for Mother's Day (I don't have school or ROTC this Thursday)! But until then, I'm supposed to fail three tests.    Failing isn't fun. It means that you have to take the darn thing all over again, which means more work. Hmmm....

       Still haven't finished the Physics...      ...and haven't had lunch yet...        Am stuck on the Physics homework...it's not all that hard, it's just so long and so...confusing. Will have to move on to Eng. Have absolutely no idea on what to do for Aj. Thip's Social Culture, so I'll have Tang do it for me, in exchange for some other work. Will probably skip the Bio review, as I'm full with all the Eng, Thai, and Physics (which probably will not be finished tonight). Let's review the schedule again:

         More on ROTC       When one thinks of joining the army, one thinks about mad drill instructors shouting their lungs off at you. This impression is, unfortunately, very much different from the truth. Here, the drill instructors here make  us  yell  our  lungs off.

         Again taking a break from doing the Physics.       A thought has just occurred to me. The main idea concerning ROTC is endurance. It's all about endurance---but it's not really about physical endurance. It's about how long and how much one can stand this silliness. It's pyschological, you see. It's not about how fast or how far you can run. How much you can endure all this bloody nonsense is what counts.   How long one can go on listening to the same old drill instructor who keeps on saying the same thing over and over, all day long. Or how long one can stand the fact that the practically useless and clumsy Poe is one's platoon leader.   Talk about endurance...

         When you think about it, school is pretty much like your stereotypical WWII PoW camp. Everything fits exactly in place when one compares the two.

        Having done Boss, well, the only logical choice was to do WoW, the former's soul mate ( to Boss: allow me some fun, will ya  ?  ).  Again, this was written by Aj. Year in early 2004.

         Boy, is this going to be a tough week. Got Physics, Social Studies (Ken), Mathematics, and probably Biology for exams this coming week.  Not to mention tons of homework...Physics, Aj. Thip's bs Report, English (an essay on some bloke named ee cummings' poem) and Biology. Urgh...I don't think I'll make it.

         Something I wrote a while ago, in Physics class...       It's currently  Physics class. Ajarn Graham seems to have this amazing ability to make the world's most interesting and exciting fact boring as hell.    Kaeng tells me that what I've just written is paradoxical in nature. Fuck him.    Aj. Graham is teaching us some useful theorems about constant acceleration, which is an important component of Physics that we'll no doubt use on a daily basis (  in fact, I can already imagine myself sitting in a car with Boom and asking him the car's average velocity   ). Kaeng tells me that I've just made a very sarcastic remark. This time, I told him to shut the fuck up and to leave me alone as I'm trying very hard to study Chemistry. I mean, Physics.     To the northeast corner of my desk, Runch is fast asleep, either  dreaming about electric sheep  or...or whatever else it is that  androids  like to dream about.   Lin, who is sitting in the front row, has just turned around and scolded Jiek for bothering her. He, of course, denies this "ridiculous allegation", for it wasn't his fault that some mysterious eraser from the moon landed on Lin's head.   Tum, sitting behind behind Chee, suddenly remarked, out of annoyance, that even though Chee's head was starting small, it could still block his viewpoint (of the board). She turns around, and reproached him.    A barrage of white coloured eraser rounds hit us a while later. The artillerists in this case are Ice and Art who, as usual, are paying no attention and content to earn F's in Physics.    Kaeng again interrupts me by saying that what I've recently remarked is extremely hypocritical in nature. I quickly clarified myself that while I'm not exactly paying attention, I still get B's, so shut the fuck up.   The bombardment continues on at a relentless pace. A few piece hit Kaeng unexpectedly on the head. He responded with typical enthusiasm with a counter barrage. I just hope that I'll have enough eraser to carry me through the upcoming exams (mathematics and the dreaded Thai). This, in turn, makes me wonder whether I'll pass or not.   Unable to endure this pessimistic thinking process, I decided to take a look around the room.   Runch is still fast asleep.   Poe, who's on my left, is, as always, lost, confused, and bewildered (often at the same time). His face is bright red with anger, as he's angry at himself and the rest of the world for not being able to comprehend what Aj. Graham's teaching.   Kaeng is about to make another annoying remark. I quickly went on the defensive by going on the offensive, telling him to mind his own fucking business ad to stop reading my fucking journal. Dispirited, his eyes returned to the board.   Having dealt with that attenuate chum of mine, I now resumed my observations. Wow, who is seated directly in front of me, seems to be attentively paying attention, although I doubt it.   Lin is secretly reading what seems to be a small novel (one of those romantic ones women are fond of, I suspect) under her desk. Far away, in the north-west corner of the room, was a group of people who were really, really, trying their best to earn A's.   My unfaithful sidekick Boom was among them, a lonely barbarian in the midst of the cultured. Oh well, at least I'll know who to depend on during the Physics test.   Behind me, things have quietened down as Art and Ice have apparently ran out of erasers. Nic and Jiek are jotting down notes while having a friendly chat with each other (probably on some teenage issue, as where to hang out or who to fuck).   Kaeng again attempts to communicate with me. But before he could utter a word, I spat out at him, no Kaeng, I do not want to hear whatever it is that you want to say, so shut the fuck up.   Where was I? Oh, yes. Having managed to decorate Chee's head with conspicous little pieces of erasers, Tum duly sped away to join Kit's group (the ones who were actually studying Physics).   Lin suddenly smacks Tor, probably because of boredom. I, however, cannot confirm this as I've only seen the after-effect (i.e. Tor rubbing his shoulder and moaning out loud).   Now, it's time for me to end this entry, as Aj. Graham is wrapping things up and I better pretend to be paying careful attention, in case he'll let us go early.

         ROTC this year is just going to be hell. First off, I was made, along with Tor and Tang, a squad leader. Which is bad enough, considering that I was at the front of the line and, more importantly, that Poe was also in my squad. As most people will be able to tell, the whole thing's going to be a rerun of  Full Metal Jacket  , with me as  Joker  and the hapless Poe as  Private Gomer Pyle .

       They've told me time and again to put my writings, rants, and raves on the net. Having spent way too much time reading through other people's blogs have convinced me to get a life. Well, I've decide to start one of my own. And here it is...
