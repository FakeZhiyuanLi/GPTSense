      Wow...this year went by so fast. First year at Claremont's already over, isn't that weird? I mean so many things happened this year and now they're gone, just like that. Strange how life progresses. Life's like the Gravitron. I'm too scared to go on it, and I'm always left outside, looking in. Watching people strapped in, along for the ride while I see them spinning around in a swirling mass of colour. The people inside are the risk-takers. They're willing to grab life by the horns (sorry for the cliche) and be whipped in every direction. No matter how many times they're hurt, they still hold on with everthing they've got. It's scary how fast we age, yet we never really ask why it happens so fast. It just..happens. What is age anyway? You can't feel it, you can't see it, but it's always with you. Kinda like air. It makes you live everyday, makes you strive to achieve anything you want. There's so much we need to know and learn in such a small amount of time. Seeing my brother graduating makes me think about this a little more than I have before. Think about it, we're expected to be married and starting a family by the age of 30. That's only another 15 years away, tops. My first 15 went by quickly, another 15 will come up just as fast. Who knows what things we'll gain or lose by then? Do you actually know what you're life's going to be like later on? No, you don't and you won't until then, but you can steer it in the right direction. Just by observing people, you can tell if they're steering themself in the right direction, and people my age, aren't. It's ironic really. The people that need the most help, don't want to ask for it and don't take things seriously, but the ones that don't need the help, think they need it. Only a few people are smart enough to turn their lives around, but sometimes they figure it out too late. *Sigh* So many things to think about, too many things to ponder, only in one lifetime do you recieve your opportunities.

      I hoped to write this sooner but I couldn't get into my account over the weekend for some reason. Anyway, on Friday, I jumped Danny 2'9! Ahhh my highest ever! I've never gone over 2 feet! Yay! I'm still smiling about it ^-^. But that kinda got ruined by my damn science project! Arrgh took me Saturday  and  Sunday to do it! Well, then again, I saw the 3rd Harry Potter movie on Saturday night so that kinda evened it out '^-^. Oh and I'm dancing today at lunch! Infront of the whole school! Ahhh I'm going to sooo mess up! Oh well, doesn't really matter since I'm in the  very  back row! Grr...I'm so topsy-turvy now, but I think this is my way of making things better for myself. I'm starting to see the glass as half full is what they say. I still think I'm somewhere in the middle, like the glass is half empty and half full. Sometimes in my life, it's fuller and sometimes it's more empty, just depends on my day. Everything's chocked full of ups and downs, you just gotta deal with it in your own way I guess. Events happen for a reason, whether you like it or know why they're happening. No one can predict what hurdles you may have to face in the near-future, and it will always remain this way. Destiny doesn't find you, you work your way towards it. I sound like a philosopher or something, don't I? Heh...I'm so weird sometimes...

      *Sigh* Yet another family tiff. Great timing. There's too much tension in this house, I need to get out of here for a while. Why does it have to be like this? You'd think we could work stuff out but noooo, we're dysfunctional. Heh, but I'm fine now. I let it all out by yelling my brains out about a certain *ahem* annoying biatch. (Ya'll know who I'm talkin' 'bout) Arrrgh she just wouldn't leave me alone! You'd think she would get the hint by now, geez...It's like everytime you turn around she's there! Lol LEECH!!! But hey, wutcha gunna do with that damn Puddle? She'll do lotsa stuff to you and expect to be liked after she's driven the knife into your back like 20 times. Grrreat...I hate this damn clingy thing. I already have a shadow thank you very much! *Sigh*...I'll never have a normal life. Too many things in the way of one. Well for me anyway. Everyone seems just so happy-go-lucky and here I am sulking. You may be reading this and saying "WTF!?", but this is what's going on in the inside. No one ever sees it, except me. Being happy is so my thing right? Sure, only in school though. When I'm around people I like, all my problems just slip away quietly. Never seen nor thought of when I'm with friends. You guys make me feel waaay better. It's my escape, my sanctuary. You may not realize it, but you guys do a lot for me. For this, I thank you. It's when I'm at home, by myself, that this stuff comes back to haunt me. Sorry Grace, I'm being too serious aren't I? Well, my life  is  serious so there's no helping it. That's all I got to say for now so, peace up, A-town. (Lol, I'm so cool, don't you dare say otherwise!)

      Weird weather we're having...I swear it matches my moods all the time! This morning was so crappy when we played colours, then it got prettyful this afternoon. I felt really gross this morning too, then I was happy, now I'm blah. Uckyful feelings. *Sigh* So many things to think about, so many opportunities slipped past me...Feels like I've been flipped upside down, shaken for all I'm worth and have just been set upright again. Trying to find your bearings is hard, especially at this age. I mean there's so many things that stand in your way nowadays. So much easier when we were little...Lol I sound so serious, this isn't like me! Maybe I'm talking about this because I watched a certain movie on the weekend about not wanting to growing up & flying away to Neverland...I do admit, there's advantages and disadvantages, but I still don't like the thought of it. So many mixed feelings to sort out. Why should I have to go through this? It's waaay too complicated for my liking. Guess it's just part of the "grand design"...(Think I've been reading too many fantasy books ^^') Arrrgh I'm too naive with the ways of the world. Wish I wasn't so much, I'd be so much easier to adjust with certain things. I'm walking a path in the dark it seems like. I don't know where I'm going, tripping and trying to get back up. Exhausted and bruised, struggling to overcome obstacles I can't see until they hit me square in the face...Just a little insight on the way I feel sometimes. I'm oblivious and point out the obvious. Classic combo for an idiot, eh? I'm so clueless sometimes...Well, guess this is all I can write for now,(kinda drained, you know how it is) I'll write in here a little later.

      Well, haven't written in here for like the longest time it feels like. I found a quote on the internet that inspired me to post something: "Life is a waste of time, time is a waste of life. So get wasted all of the time and have the time of your life." Clever&nbsp;and half true, I think. Sometimes life is a waste of time, but rarely. Time is definitely&nbsp;not&nbsp;a waste of life since without time, no life would exist. Heh, the last part is the best but&nbsp;I doubt I'd wanna get wasted all of the time...o_O Oh well, back to my world...   I felt so bad yesterday. I hated myself, for everything.&nbsp;Actually, it's been going on&nbsp;for the&nbsp;past week...why do I feel we all&nbsp;aren't equal? It's not fair that&nbsp;some people&nbsp;have&nbsp;some things&nbsp;that others envy them for. "It all works out in the end," right? Well where's the end and when's it coming? For many, it can never work out completely. There's only a small possibility that anything will be alright. I know I sound so negative, but it's all true. You always want what you can't have and no one's ever satisfied with what they do possess. There are so many things that can and are denied to you, and there's nothing you can do about it. Compensations are what you recieve instead or nothing is given at all. I feel like I've been denied what I want and denied even a simple compensation instead. But there's a reason for everything, right? Wrong. The only reason I'm not given the things I want or even deserve&nbsp;the most, is because the world is letting&nbsp;others&nbsp;get lucky on my misfortunes. Although, I do have to take into consideration the unlucky&nbsp;events that happen to the fortunate sometimes. I don't see them suffer as much as I usually do though. Either that or they refuse to show it. Wish I could refuse to show my sorrow when I've been dealt a horrible hand. Maybe that's why better things happen to people who don't show their unhappiness. Fate is weaving my tapestry slowly but surely, then snipping the strings faster than the loom can work...

      Ah. Finally free. No school, no worries. Damn, it's gunna be a nice 2 months off! *Sigh*...it's off to a better start than any other summer. I was such a loner! (What's the difference from now, eh? '-__-) I'm still a loner at heart ^_~. Anyway...I just came back from the movies and I saw Shrek 2(FINALLY)! I have dubbed thy donkey/dragon/mutant babies, DRAGONKIES! Now I want one! Lol! As you may have guessed, I'm quite sugar high from all that candy I ate at the theatre! ^^; So pretty much, this post is randomness all the way! Muwahahahahahaha! Hah! I can see you shaking your head! Don't you laugh at me! Only I can laugh at me :D! Hehe...well now that that's over, why don't I talk about something, uh, less pointless ^^'? Hmmm, let's see...I saw my brother graduate on Tuesday and it was so weird to see him up on stage! Oh and all the pretty dresses! Ooooh can't wait till I grad! It's going to be soooo fun picking out and trying on dresses until I find the perfect one! But then again, gradding is so nerve-racking. I mean, you gotta go off to college or university after the summer, not lil ol' Claremont anymore. You gotta make it on your own. When I saw the ceremony, I thought to myself, "I'm going to go through this in 3 years,". Three years isn't that long either ya know. It's strange how we've come so far, yet we haven't even seen half of our lives yet. o_O I'm really scaring myself now! Think I'd better go before I start reminiscing about my childhood again...
