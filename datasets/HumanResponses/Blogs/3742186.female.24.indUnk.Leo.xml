      On the bus ride home yesterday, I overheard an older woman conversing with someone.  "I want to live to 130.  Maybe longer!"  Until this point, I had never realized the importance of one's lower teeth.  As this woman spoke, her tongue kept rolling right out of her mouth.  I had to wonder if this was a result of her missing lower teeth, or just lack of interest in controlling her tongue.

      Not sure how  huge  my fan base has become, since no one has left  comments , but for those of you that missed me, sorry I couldn't post this weekend.  For the time being, I have to post at work, since I don't have internet access at home.  Normally I would be at work on Saturday, but I needed a mental health day, otherwise known as: I had a "migraine".    So, it's out...I work on Saturdays. The great thing about Saturdays is that while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, Matt and I have really interesting conversations.  Fortunately I'm aware enough of my surroundings at that hour to appreciate them.  I think Matt is too tired to realize what he's saying sometimes.  For example:    Him: What do you want to do tonight? Me: I don't know, what do you want to do? Him: We should do something nice. Me: What do you mean, "something nice"? Him: You know, just something nice. Me: (trying to get more clarification) Well, we always do nice things. Him:  Okay, then lets do something  bad !

      I once read or heard someone say that we're only making ourselves age faster when we constantly look forward to the weekend.  So what does that say for those of us who simply look forward to going home and drinking a beer at the end of each day?  My guess is that we're making ourselves age,  and  get fat faster.  So, girly night wasn't so bad.  I'm now the proud owner of a little pink purse.  My new purse is so cute!  It even has a little matching coin purse!  I still stand by my previous statement, however.  I am  not  girly!  It was the wine, I swear.  The wine made me do it.   All of the ladies at girls night were so excited about my new purchase.  "Oh, it's the perfect size for some cash and your lipstick!".  Um, try chapstick, honey.  My purse comes with two strap options.  There's the short, "carry your purse in your hand" type strap, and then there's the "over the shoulder" variety.  In my opinion, the best part about my new purse is that the smaller strap is the perfect length to be a little pink collar!  Y'know what's frightening?  I can totally picture the pink collar, with the purse, and some matching pink strappy heels.  Not girly at all...right.

      1. I arrived at the office on time, regardless of the fact that all of my clocks were  blinking  when I woke up. I'm not sure what caused the outage - it's just a normal overcast day in Seattle.    As stated in m-w.com, pretentious can be defined as "exaggerated importance".  Am I the only one who finds "the office" pretentious sounding?  I mean, who  says  that, anyway???  2. I have read all of my online news sources, including The Seattle Times, CNN, Netscape, Eonline and The Stranger.    US flight training exercises are scheduled for today.  The drills will involve fighter planes and other aircraft flying at low altitudes throughout the day.  I guess they wanted to let us know so that we wouldn't start ducking under bushes, which, as one of my friends recently stated, "totally works".    3. I have managed to avoid playing tetris or solitaire.    Work is pretty slow these days, so sometimes I find that I've been playing computer games for several hours.  This is pretty amazing in itself, considering the consistency of my brain matter at that point.    4. I managed to get myself looped into "girly night"; I'm leaving work early for it, no less.  I guess I could be called girly at times, though I've always been irritated by girly things.  What does this mean????  "Girly night" is being held at Jardin, a local winery by my house.  Once a month they have a girls night.  Tonight they will have hair models on site to show the new summer styles!  Oooh, and we'll get demonstrations of waxing techniques.  Gross.  Well, I suppose the on site wine will make the on site models and waxing more interesting.    5. I set up my new blog.  Ta-da!

      I was sitting at my desk this afternoon and acquired an enormous craving for cheddar/sour cream Ruffles (they have ridges, y'know).&nbsp; Of course, the vending machine on my floor was all out, so I ran down to the 3rd floor to grab a bag.&nbsp; On the way back&nbsp;up the stairs, one of my sandals caught on a step, and I went down with a squeak and a thud.&nbsp; Two "suits" were standing by the stairwell, and they just turned to stare at me while I re-composed myself.&nbsp;   Yes, it hurt a little.&nbsp; My toes, knees, hands and pride are all a little bruised.&nbsp; But,  damn  those chips were worth it.&nbsp;

      Matt took me to a very nice dinner for my birthday on Saturday.&nbsp; If you're ever in Seattle and want a treat, go  urlLink here .   We were walking across the street to the restaurant, and I had a highly entertaining conversation with a woman who was walking in the opposite direction:   Her - Nice dress.  Me - Thank you.  Her - You're welcome, Bitch!   The moment that last word exited her mouth, I recognized her.&nbsp; I looked right at Matt and said, "Wow!&nbsp; I've run into her before!&nbsp; I remember her complimenting me on something, and then calling me a bitch!".&nbsp;   That moment totally made my birthday.

      This morning at breakfast, Matt and I had one of our more entertaining conversations.  &nbsp;  Me: So, what would you do if I suddenly went crazy one day, and I became one of those ladies who walks around downtown and yells at people for no apparent reason?  &nbsp;  Him: I would throw you away.  &nbsp;  Me: Huh.  &nbsp;  Him: No, I would have you admitted into a mental institution.&nbsp; No, wait!&nbsp; I would just make sure that you were really hopped up on drugs all the time!  &nbsp;  Me:&nbsp;You're having a lot of fun with this, aren't you?  &nbsp;  Him:&nbsp; What would you do if I became one of those guys who walked around the neighborhood with my robe falling open, mumbling to myself?  &nbsp;  Me:&nbsp;Eat your toast.

      So, we called the plumber back about our sink issue yesterday.&nbsp; It turns out that sometimes when a plumber does really intense work, such as replacing a bunch of pipes, the disruption can cause rust and deposits to drop into the lines, and when you turn on the water, all of that stuff gets flushed to the end of the faucet, blocking the water flow.&nbsp; Sure enough, Matt removes the end of the faucet, and there's a bunch of crusty crap in the filter.&nbsp; This is a good thing to know, considering the calls I get at work!&nbsp;

      I'm not a big fan of showering at work.&nbsp; My home shower drain was getting pretty slow, so like a good consumer, I used drain cleaner on Monday.&nbsp; Tuesday I followed the directions on the bottle, and tried drain cleaner a second time.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;I found out yesterday that most of the time, drain cleaner crystallizes, and completely stops up your drain.&nbsp; Wish I had known that on Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday I snaked the drain.&nbsp; Yesterday a plumber came out, and worked under the house, replacing most of the horrendously old plumbing.&nbsp; I had a nice collection of pipes sitting by my garbage can when he was done, 3 hours later.&nbsp; Apparently there was years of nastiness built up&nbsp;in the plumbing...Makes me wonder if my landlord ever had maintenance done.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After the plumber left, Matt and I were having a lovely time playing with the tub water, watching it go down the drain, in amazement.&nbsp; Then we turned the sink&nbsp;faucet on, and noted that hot and cold were both coming out in barely a trickle...time to call our local plumber again.  &nbsp;  On a positive note, I felt incredibly lucky to have a gym at work with a shower this week .

      An excerpt from today's "Mom" email:    Adventure Cat was quite upset with us late yesterday afternoon. We decided to change her bedding for her. The kids and I removed the kittens and Adventure cat then I quickly placed a clean sheet in for them before replacing the kittens. Adventure Cat was big time miffed! She mewed and threw quite the tizzy. She then moved the kittens to an undesirable spot where we had plastic bags stored. Then she got mad because we removed the plastic bags and put the kittens back in their original home. After yelling at all of us then yelling real loud at Nathan and chasing him away from the area she moved one kitten to a small box that really wasn't even big enough for just her. She then proceeded to lay on top of the kitten and refused to budge! I got another box together for her and moved it under the chair near where she wanted to be and placed the kitten in it. She hopped in and seemed content until the other kittens started crying for her. She then poked her head out and mewed at me so I brought the others to her. They're all happily abiding in their new home and we will wait plenty of time before attempting to change the bedding for her again.

      An email from Mom:    Later in the day I headed out to the garden to see how it was going. Out came the kids all excited. Adventure Cat was going to have babies and Daddy was having problems. I came back in and found Daniel on his hands and knees trying to extract Adventure Cat from a less than desirable area. We finally, after much coaxing and rearranging convinced her to settle for a better spot. That poor cat had one heck of a time! At one point, shortly before popping the first one out somehow managed to jump out of her box and come looking for me. That poor cat could barely keep her hind end off the floor! She was squatting, having contractions and begging me to help to help her. We managed to get her back in the box then the kids and I took turns keeping her company. Lindsay saw the first two being born and Nathan and I saw the last one being born. A most painful experience for the new Mama. Last night she kept trying to take little breaks but every time she'd take a couple steps away the kittens would start crying. She was actually grumbling (almost a growl) on her way back a couple times. LOL Grrrr, durn kids! She was thrilled to see us all emerge from the bedroom this morning and immediately came out to get us and lead us back to her box so we could take turns keeping her company again.

      I just went to the restroom, and saw something interesting.  There was a random trail of raisin bran leading to the end stall.  Said stall is nick-named the "poo stall", on account of the fact that it's out of the way, so it's where the girls go to, well...you know.   I'm strangely relieved that there weren't milk spills on the floor.

      So, I was in the shower this morning, and thought...  What if I baked cookies for John Kerry?  I could send him a batch of chocolate chip, or maybe peanut butter, with a little note, wishing him luck on the election.  THEN...he would call me up and tell me how wonderful the cookies were, and ask me to be his "election baker".  My first assignment would be to bake a   gagillion   cookies for his next public speech.  I would have to decline, "That's a really great offer senator, but my little kitchen simply can't handle that much business at once".  "Not to worry, my dear!"  He would respond, "You can move into my mansion where we'll build you a large commercial kitchen, and we also plan to provide you with an assistant baker."    Wow...that was a really good daydream...I just added the assistant part in while I was typing this.

      Below is an excerpt from an email that I received from my mother.  She is remarried with two small kids, whom she is teaching to read:     First stop was the cigarette store. Daniel ran in while the kids and I waited in the car. While he was in there a pickup pulled up and parked next to it. It had a decal on the side which Nathan immediately set to reading. "GGG Go-o-o-od, God! BBB-Bl-Bl-ble-ble-bless,Bless! God Bless! Aa ammm-ammmeee-amerrriiii-amerriic-amerriic-amerriicaaa-America! God Bless America!" He's an American! Lindsay then chimed in "He's an American! He has an American car! See! He has an American Flag!" They were both so excited to be parked next to an American with an American car! When he came out I was tempted to thank him for keeping my kids busy :-)

      My daily routine consists of receiving calls from restaurants with facilities issues...Anything from plumbing to air conditioning problems.  If it can fall apart, they call me about it.  I generally try to do basic troubleshooting over the phone (don't touch the   blue   wire), and if we can't fix it, I dispatch a technician to go take a look.  I was perusing through some old calls, and I came across this one:  Plumbing - Women's restroom sink ripped off the wall.  Store saw a man and a woman enter the bathroom, then heard a loud crash shortly thereafter.  No water leaks.

      I have the worst breath ever right now.  I can't do anything about it at the moment.  We're short-staffed today, and I can't really leave my desk until Steven comes back from his lunch.  The problem is, I didn't realize how horrible my situation was until he had just left.  Of course, when I realize something like this, I have to try and figure it out.  Lemme see...coffee, Chinese food, mouth-breathing while zoning out to Tetris.  Yup.  30 minutes left of atrocious breath.  Great.

      The person in the cubicle next to mine just poured himself cereal.  Have you ever paid attention when someone was preparing a bowl of cereal?  So you pour the milk on top, right?  Then you have to pat the flakes down with your spoon - maybe stir them around a bit.  I always thought the flakes sounded like tinfoil.

       Overheard conversation involving two girls walking down the street:   G1: Man!  My skin is totally falling off from the sunburn I got last weekend! G2: Really?  You should do what I do.  I never peel after a burn. G1: Wow...What's that? G2: Well, I always use aloe vera.   G1: Hmm. G2: Okay, so, during the first few days, when the burn is really bad?  You want to cover yourself in aloe in the morning and at night.  Or twice a day or whatever, kay? G1: Uh-Huh. G2: Then, after the burn has gone down a bit, you only do the aloe thing in the morning, or just less than twice a day.  G1: Yeah. G2: So, that's what I do, y'know?    Overheard conversation involving a man on the bus and no one else:   Man: Y'know what that Krispy Kreme ought to do?  Everyone else:.... Man: They should get a sign; one of those signs like McDonald's got, that says how many hamburgers they've sold.  Everyone else:.... Man: They sell over a billion donuts a year, y'know?  Everyone else:.... Man: That's a lot of donuts. Everyone else:.... Man: They're not even that good! Everyone else:....

      I think that I'm more aware of the people on the bus now that I'm posting my thoughts online...They provide such great material!  Yesterday someone moved from their spot 2 seats down from me, to sit right next to me.  For no particular reason - he didn't even try to start a conversation.  He was a really sweaty bike-rider, and it grossed me out.  This in turn prompted me to hold onto the metal pole, so as not to accidentally bump into "sweaty biker guy" if the bus lurched to a stop.  A few moments later, someone else boarded the bus.  We'll call him "sweat-pants man".  When "sweat-pants man" got on the bus, there were tons of empty seats.  He opted to stand right in front of me, and lean against the pole, in such a way that his ass was  right above my hand .  I was wedged between "sweaty biker guy" and "sweat-pants man".  Ugh.  Now, I'm not overly sensitive about personal space.  You really can't be on public transportation.  But  c'mon  people!

      My eight year old nephew is staying at our house for the weekend, and we're having a great time sofar. Last night Justin took a shower before bed, and came out to say goodnight wearing khaki shorts and a button up dress shirt.   Me:  Justin, why are you wearing that?  Justin:  This is what I'm wearing tomorrow.  Me:  I get that, but why are you wearing it now?  Justin:  Mom didn't pack any pajamas for me.  Me:  Huh. Well, you can't be comfortable in that; why don't you wear one of Matt's Tshirts?  Justin:  No, this is fine.  He then proceeded to pull the blankets back and crawl into bed, wearing belt and all. My nephew is a freaky kid.  This morning Justin came out of bed ready made! Matt made blueberry pancakes for breakfast. Afterwards, I mentioned something about brushing teeth, and Justin just looked at me.   Me:  Lemme guess, you're mom didn't pack a toothbrush for you?  Justin:  Yeah! (giggle)  Me:  Well, we just need to pick one up for you today.  Justin:  She packed a sweater for me.  Me:  Yeah, I saw that. A nice knit sweater - perfect for winter, but no toothbrush. Next time I'm sending your mom a checklist.

      My sister is coming up to drop my nephew off for the weekend, and our house is a disaster.  We had borrowed her steam cleaner for our living room carpet, and we have to return it this weekend while my sister is up. We've had the cleaner for over a month, and of course, we just got around to using it last night. At 8:30. I have to say, it looked great when Matt was done. I found it pretty amusing however, when he called me in to express his confusion that the carpet was wet. Apparently he thought that the cleaner would suck enough water back up that the carpeting would be dry when he was done, so he had moved all our stuff outside, thinking it would be moved right back when he was finished. All of the livingroom furniture is currently in my kitchen and dining room, waiting to be moved back after work.  Maybe my sister will help move it all back!

      I finally broke down and ordered a Frappuccino at Starbucks today. I used to get the vanilla ones on occasion, but I stopped when I was forced to admit to the nutritional value of them. Well, today I decided to try the new vanilla bean creme frappuccino, and wow is it yummy! Remember when you were a kid, and you would eat frosting straight out of the plastic container? Well, I don't. I don't think we ever had store-bought frosting as kids, but I can imagine what it was like. The vanilla bean creme frappuccino is  even better  than eating frosting straight out of the plastic container! (or what I imagine it to be like) Props to Mom for making store bought frosting something that I have to imagine, and props to Starbucks for their tasty beverages!

      I bought the coolest toy for my younger brother's birthday! I found a space shuttle with a docking station! It also has two spacemen and a little space truck! The package arrived last week, and I just got around to wrapping it and shipping it off to him today, but not without playing with it first! The other night Matt was making dinner, and I came in with the box, looking for a knife.   Matt:  What'cha doin'?  Me:  I'm gonna play with Nathan's new toy!  Matt:  Wha- No, Kim, put it down.  Me:  (cutting through the tape)What?  Matt:  You're going to break it before you even send it to him!  Me:  No I won't, silly. I think I can figure out how to - wow! The doors of the shuttle open! Ooh, and there's a little arm thing that comes out! Neat!  Matt:  Kim, put it back in the box!  Me:  No! I want to look at it! I'm "testing" it.  Matt:  Silence.  Me:  Ooh! The truck has a satellite dish thingie on top!  Matt:  We can get you one of your own if you'd like.  Me:  Actually, it  is  pretty cool...Okay, I'm going to put it away now.

I was telling Pamela about my harrowing,  near-getting-stuck-on-the-shelf-in-my-closet  experience (see below), and she told me that my life plays out like an   I Love Lucy   episode.  Makes one wonder why I was blessed with the ability to reproduce, huh?

      Matt and I keep the bedroom door closed, so that the cats don't molest my clothing and bedspread, leaving a trail of cat hair behind. This morning I learned the dangers of having a push-button lock on your bedroom door. We're still trying to figure out who is responsible, but I  do  know one thing: After my shower, I couldn't get dressed because the bedroom door was locked. I tried jamming a pen in the little hole on the outside, and I even tried sliding an old atm card down the space between the door and the frame. Nothing worked. It was time to channel  urlLink MacGyver .  Our house has 2 bedrooms, which sit side by side, and they "share" a closet. When you look into the closet for one room, you realize that you're looking at half a closet. You can see over the wooden barrier, into the other half of the closet, and into the other room. I think at one time, the two bedrooms were a walk-thru of sorts.  So, Matt boosted me, wearing only a bathrobe, up to the shelf in the closet of the room that we could still access. I managed to turn myself around so that I wouldn't have to dive face first out of the other side, and did this cramped scoot sortof thing until I got to the other side. I looked down - man that's a ways up for someone who's afraid of heights! I started to slide down, and about halfway there, I realized that if I were to continue, I would end up with a bunch of hangers in my face, which could prove painful. I actually managed to pull myself back up onto the closet shelf, leaned over, and started removing clothing from the closet, and throwing it on the floor. I found a  box  on the shelf, which I proceeded to drop on the floor, so  I  wouldn't have to drop as far. Then I turned around again, and braced my feet on either side of the door frame. I scootched myself down with my feet, until my arms and chin were the only thing holding me to the shelf, then dropped.  It was a good morning.

      My mother had emailed me complaining of dry red patches on her skin, asking if I had any recommendations. I suggested she try a good moisturizer and drinking more water. Matt was standing nearby when I read the first part of her response:   Mom:   Well, we have a little vaseline laying around and some lotion we picked up for Lindsay awhile back.   Me:   Eew!   Matt:   What?   Mom:   Maybe I'll try the lotion and save the vaseline for Lindsay when her lips start drying out.   Me:   Oh, good!   Matt:   What??   Me:   Oh, nothing. I thought mom was going to put vaseline on her face, but it turns out she's not.    Matt:   Oh.

      I have these great pants that I haven't worn in awhile, and I decided to give them a "comeback moment" today for work. Unfortunately said "comeback moment" has turned into several not so pleasant  moments . Please take my advice, and try old favorites on   before   you wear them out in public.    1. I think my behind and thighs have gotten a bit larger, because my pants don't quite fit right anymore. Sure, they look alright on, but the pockets won't stay put! The pants have buttons on both sides, above the pockets, to create a bit of a "sailor" look. They're very cute, but if they don't fit just right, the pocket insides pooch out. I have to walk around with my hands in my pockets so that I don't look lame.  2. The pants lace up the back, and the laces are really long, so they hang down, kindof like a tail. It sounds silly, now that I've typed it out, but trust me, they're great. They're a nice charcoal color, so they work just fine for the office. I like to call it "office flair". I learned the importance of not forgetting previous  wardrobe malfunctions  today. I went to the restroom, and just before I proceeded to let go of my willpower, I looked into that little space between the edge of the seat and my crotch, and lo and behold, there were my laces. In the water. Timing is everything, girls.  Who knew that it was possible to curse in silence? Probably a good thing. Can you imagine sitting in an office restroom, occupying the stall next to a woman who suddenly starts yelling vulgarities? It would probably freak the average girl out.  Needless to say, I grabbed toilet paper as fast as I could, and started attempting to dry my laces. As previously stated, the laces are charcoal in color. Yes, you guessed it, there were little bits of white toilet paper all over my laces. Damn. I proceeded to finish my business, then grabbed paper towels to do the job. They don't leave as much behind as toilet paper does.  3. I finally got back to my desk, and proceeded to do my work. At one point I looked down. I don't know what caused me to look down, but now I'm glad I did. I will be keeping my legs crossed for the remainder of the day. The seam is coming apart. The hem isn't coming loose, and a button isn't coming off, no. The seam on the upper thigh of my left leg is coming loose. Beautiful.
