      the refrain repeats in my head as i navigate the airport terminal. i sing, drawing out the syllables of 'anything' into a sonorous moan. fellow passengers waiting at the TSA checkpoint look at me like i have two heads. i could do  anything , i'm utterly unpredictable at this point. hide your sons and daughters.  i slept none on the plane today. there was a brief moment when i forgot for a second that i was there, but i wouldn't call it sleep. lots of space though - a row to myself and playing peek-a-boo with the tot in front of me. on the next leg (almost no layover) the deaf lady i passed notes with told me "you are a wonderful boy".  i think we finished the album. just compared notes with greg on the phone, there is few things left to do. technical things. deletion of scritchies. bounce (to disc). sleep. must sleep.  notes to Jon Cohrs on mastering - very few:  deerhead like cody chestnutt, ie. too much compression.  and  beware the sub synth triggered by the kick in many of these songs.   also, to greg. for deerhead remix, try adjusting the subsynth frequency. i usually use about 80-120. it's much higher on deerhead now. that song is not normal.   to the band: good work, my god men! i applaud your capacitors. the frequencies resonate. elmo has left the building. keep writing words for the horns, and horns for the words. tamborine trapezoid trumpet triangle. break a tow, mo' tha' mow. wimbeldon folly hamburger volley. sunshine sinks boats in moats root beer. grape leaves, baklava. tangerine, rakmaninov. sandpaper doorknob!

      A lull. We're taking a break right now afte the very very end of tracking (putting down Amy's harmonies on ATHP). Chris leaves in about six hours at this point and we still have most of "mixing" left to do. Banana Split and ATHP are in the bag, but that's it. Seven left to go including Arab Fiesta which hasn't really been begun. Its going to be a challenge, but this is where Chris eats.  We went our separate ways for dinner and such. My job is to lie silently somewhere that doesn't affect the sonics in Chris's ears while he mixes just in case he has any technical DP3 or other kinds of questions. We're reconvening at 2am to make final mixing comments and -- hopefully -- jump up and down on completion of the album.  I really think we have something here.  Its pretty silent in right now besides the whirring of the  urlLink Music for Dozens  server. Its refreshing.  All of the tasks that have to get accomplished this week (album art, titling, track order, arranging mastering, tour e-mails, catching up with  urlLink PDX POP , talking to all of my family and friends I've been neglecting, etc.) are beginning to creep up on me. That must be a sign that we've crossed some kind of threshold. Cary's playing Meri ATHP upstairs and hearing it through the ceiling just put me in a trance for a second. We just spent so much time getting all the vocal levels perfectly set. Its nice to hear that they stand up, even from the basement. I can hear everyone clearly.  I'm going to go eat something and rejuvenate before Chris gets back. Hopefully the next your hear, the record will be done.

      greg's printer just ate a slice of paper the way i eat a sheet of pizza. its the end of another long day at the album factory, and i'm having trouble seeing how we can possibly finish the project - if we were just coming into the work now, with two days left and the same amount undone, it would be no problem, but it's like day 11 (morale low), so we're gonna have to push through and see what happens. a day for mixing is not scary - but it will be hard if it also a day for vocals and whatever else needs doing.  on the agenda, retracking 'banana split' vocals, guitars on 'unwater', everything fucking else.

      Another fine day behind us, one which saw the likely end of all non-guitar-or-vocals overdubs.  After a delightful breakfast of bacon and eggs, and then a quick jaunt out to Fred Meyer to purchase a whole sack's worth of only embarrassing bathroom items, I met the boys at Prexy, intending to slather on some sexy-ass piano overdubs.  To my amazement, I was met nearly at the door by the half-smiling, half-sneering countenance of Ginny Hancock, who has moved into Prexy for the summer while the fourth floor of Eliot undergoes renovation of some kind.  She graciously allowed us to stay in Prexy for as long as we needed, pending Bonnie's approval (which we eventually got), and was even kind enough to loan us a power strip: an act of magnaminity almost completely nullified by Greg's unforseeable near-catastrophe of walking in on her in the bathroom.  Whoops.  Anyway, sexy-ass piano overdubs, which I played a whole lot better than I was expecting, were enjoyed, on PS, Unwater, and Welcome Home; I also laid down some of my thickest slabs of free-form nonsense to date on Arab Fiesta, which Chris has been afforded license to screw with all he wants, Martin Swope style.  All of that should turn out swell.  After a quick lunch at Woodstock Wine & Deli and some editing/picking up slides/playing Gamecube time, we trekked out to Gregory Heights for what we expect to be the last time, and tracked some mbira on PS, courtesy of Cary, and some trombone on everywhere, courtesy of Ethan, who, it should be noted, fucking rocks on the trombone.  With our intentions of starting early tomorrow made clear, we headed home, and everyone enjoyed a slice of pie except me, because I hadn't (and still haven't) yet confronted the prospect of dinner.  And start early we shall, as tomorrow shakes us loose from the fool's paradise of Gregory Heights and sends us careening back into the cosmic nausea of the practice space, where one must arrive early if one hopes to a.) track audio without the interference of adjacent rocking/screaming/carpentry/general rabble, and b.) avoid the management, who, despite doing a wonderful job managing, in all practical respects, happens to live there and always be drunk (too drunk for genuine comic effect) and tell endless stories in the manner of a four-year-old which, I'm afraid, are rather distracting from any tasks you may be hoping to undertake.  Guitars and vocals, then mixing, and we be done, mama.

      These last few days are running together in a pretty serious way.  It feels like I get home and am allowed no more than an hour of waking life with Jen before bedtime, and that I wake up in the morning with a maximum of twenty minutes to spare before I have to jet out the door to get back to work.  I'm at "work" now, and I've been awake for 46 minutes.  I'm not complaining; there is no way I'd rather be spending my days than knocking out this album (which grows more and more promising as the songs mass).  It's just an awfully weird experience for mind and body alike.  I have memories from about six weeks ago of living in much the same way as this when I was in the final stages of my thesis, but that was a much more isolated effort.  At least this time there are four of us all working toward the same deadline, sharing the same level of dedication/enthusiasm.  Truthfully, it's been a blast so far, very much in keeping with Chris's early assertion that it would be like going to "making a record" camp.  An exhausting blast.  I'm going to indulge in a sandwich of some sort soon, and follow that up with some serious strawberry-rhubarb pie courtesy of Ethan and Meri thank you both very much.  Then it's back to GH for our last day of basics, which will match us against [gulp] Deerhead.  I'll write another one of these later today or tomorrow, when there might be hope of actually being able to construct words resulting from neurological activity of some kind.

      So, I'm tired enough now that I can barely keep unwarranted k's, and j's out of these words I'm typing. I'll keep this short.  Maybe I'm so tired because of the way the day started: Out of toilet paper? Wet Wipes. Executive!  Or maybe, its because of the brutality of carrying stuff, followed by carrying stuff, followed by recording, followed by carrying stuff, and wrapped up with carrying some stuff. Either way, the day started out well. We got together somewhat late, Chris getting here around 12:30, while I was in the shower and putting up PS for mixing. It sounded a million times better than it had in my memory. Amazing how recordings can do that. Anyway, Chris did his magic on the track and its sounding better than any basic tracks of our have ever done, closer to completion.  Now I'm feeling like maybe the reservations of mine that Cary was talking about yesterday are specifically related to Arab Fiesta rather than all the new songs as a whole. I just feel like I know how that song is supposed to go less than the others. That means I don't really have any good overdub ideas and no way of evaluating the sound of it to figure out what we need to do. Whatever, at least I'm feeling really optimistic about the results of these new sessions and I have some renewed faith in my original theory of these new songs needing fewer overdubs; sounding better raw.  Recording at Gregory Heights was filled with more obstacles than yesterday. Matt, a member of the Portland band Cart! who we played with in January in Corvalis was around (he works for Portland Parks and Rec with the after school program we're kind of operating through). It seemed like he was supposed to be in charge of throwing us out, but instead was a super hero, let us stay and gave us the devil sign in appreciation, even of bad takes. Even with his support, we had to wait until 6 when the principal left to start actually making noise.   Even with the late recording start, we had tons of time, which we managed to fill with incomplete and imperfect takes. As Chris reminded, the work expands to fill the time. And, at the end of the night -- on the other end of pasta, Ethan and Meri's strawberry-rubarb pie, an episode of the West Wing, and a perfect-as-usual editing job by Chris -- we have really strong basics for Unwater.  Tomorrow is Deerhead and the end of basics (a landmark!). . .somehow at that point it will seem like the battle will be mostly won. All we have left to do is an infinite number of tasks in an all too finite amount of time. What could be so hard about that?

      so today at Gregory Heights, as the band was getting into their 2nd complete rendition of "unwater," i started to get funky in my chair. i was unsurfing, arms to the side, head bopping in time. it's moments like this that really make recording appeal to me. front row seats at the best concerts in the world.   so today was a, and i think this is the best way to put it, a big dig. we got in there and got some takes, good but maybe could be better, etc... and worked and worked and passed the point of getting better, and blah and see how this sentence is a run-on and doesn't quite make sense? well, that's how the day was. in editing now, we've decided to use the 'unsurfing' take for the first half, the death-metal double kick run from take 6, and the end of take 5. in a year we will have forgotten where the edits are at all.  i think it was will who told me that rick rubin says that the best drum takes are the ones that always seem on the verge of falling apart, but somehow don't. i think this holds true for all basic tracks. to my ear, interest is held by the suspense that accompanies always wondering if the band is gonna pack it in, break a string, or just plain fuck up too much to make the take usable. this was 'unsurfing'.  also, it is hard to remember not to treat the live takes, as they go down, as though they are recordings already. yes, they are recorded, but the future is not determined, and a good start does not mean a good end. a fine line we walk.

      I think I'm beginning to remember what being in school - or at least its anti-somnolent effects - feels like.  Not much sleep going on in this corner these days.  That said, I think we're doing a pretty good job of having long workdays, but not totally losing our minds and ears over it.  Greg and I threw down - I want to emphasize the violence of our actions as strongly as possible - THREW down some acoustic guitar overdubs today.l  Actually, they were quite pretty and fairly gentle.  In all likelihood, if mishandled - let alone thrown - they would probably shatter.  Also, we confirmed that I cannot sing in the morning.  We were feeling pretty confident and complacent about the work we had to do today.  We were planning on recording the basic tracks for PS back at Gregory Heights today - the least demanding track technically for all of us.  You can imagine what happened.  We went into the "studio", got set up with expert efficiency, and proceeded to knock out a series of lackluster, loping takes.  Amy was along for the ride and ended up leaving, probably feeling like she was contributing to our discomfort with the situation.  While I do like privacy, I can assure you she wasn;t a factor - we were just sucking and psyching ourselves out about doing so.    Will was having some trouble getting an opening drum part that, while it would be really difficult for me to play, is just not a part he would ever dream of being challenging, let alone temporarily impossible.  But, so it was.  We just couldn't get it together, and thus punctuated our frustrate attempts with breaks involving alternately loud laughter or silent brooding.    In the end, though, Will removed his socks, we chilled out, figured out what to simplify to cut our losses, and got in touch with the breeziness that PS needs to work.  And we got a great take out of it.  Greg and I - I'll leave the others out of it, as I don't know where they stand - seem to be having some disagreement about what needs to happen with this last batch of 4 songs, or at least how capble we are of getting done what needs to be done.  Greg is making the argument that ample time - months of it - was central to the success we had with overdubs, in terms of both quality and variety, on the last batch of songs.  I think that's true, but I think I have more confidence in the unencumbered, sparser strength of these new songs, particularly with the new recording situation.  I think we'll get some overdubs on there, they'll be good, and our time strictures will keep us from overloading these tracks.  In any case, I just can't allow myself to think that they'll end up anything other than relaizing their maximum potential.  Which I do believe will be the case.  you'll see.  East Coast tour prep, and what it gestures towards, is keeping me very excited.  Nick Drake "From The Morning" just came up on my iPod.  Talk about succesful sparseness.  Not a rock band, I realize, but my god, he blows my mind.  I'm quite anxious to hear the new song ("Tow The Line", I believe it's called) of his that they dug up for the new retrospective comp.  Lastly, does anyone else have grave fears about Brian Wilson re-recording Smile, instead of just using what was there?  I mean, did you hear that solo record?  Suddenly, Bruce Springsteen drum reverb is sounding tame...  Maybe more sleep tonight!

      Today was a day for the At Dusk Extended Family & Support Crew to shine.  I arrived home from a great warm-up breakfast with Meri at Genie's, only to find that Amy had brought over strawberries, tangerine juice and champagne for mimosas, as detailed by Will.  The strawberries were seconded when Ethan and Meri returned from a 15-pound berry picking binge at Sauvie Island.  And Amy drew a cartoon of our lives.  It's on our refrigerator.  Not as good as her joke, but still sun nice.  Ethan made his second musical tour of duty today, as he strolled with the grace of a winged gazelle from trombone to accordion.  As for that, don't believe all of the Lawrence Welk propaganda - the accordion and its cousins is a beautiful instrument, and I'm excited to reclaim it for our record. Just ask Paul Simon, Astor Piazzola, South Africans and - if you have to - the French.  Plus, Ethan wears a wig if asked to while recording, which really ups the yuck-yuck-factor after several hours of recording.  The sun came out today at night.  Or what should be night.  The day was cloudy.  7pm on was looking pretty fine and light.  The SM57/Monitor tagteam continued its march of victory today - Banana Split/Too Far is nigh on vocally complete.  Sopranos - as ever.  Plus, Meri taped "Extraordinary Cats" off OPB for me tonight.  At my request.  I also wrote several kitten-themed checks today to pay for our utilities.  I'm a boy.   And tomorrow brings us back into the real-tracks studio, which I'm ancing for.  Ancing means to be ancy, as defined by me, and whoever I point a gun at.  P.S  here we come!

      As Cary and Chris sit upstairs recording acoustic 12-string overdubs on ATHP (which will be endowed with an actual title as soon as one of us writes some lyrics), I sit in the surprisingly cold basement typing this up on Greg's laptop.  Greg's shimmering, breathtaking laptop.  I gotta get me one of these things.  Thanks to Amy and Chris for the tangerine mimosas (or perhaps tangerosas) that we all enjoyed this morning, as well as the strawberries.  And to Ethan for the raisin bagel.  That was one executive bagel.  Amen to Cary's sentiment about tracking vocals with live monitors.  The difference, in terms of the comfort level of the experience, and (therefore) the quality of the result, was extraordinary.  I'm certain I never would have gotten such a satisfying take of the final hook on Welcome Home were it not for the change of approach.  Threw some pretty sweet harmonies on top of a few parts too, and laid down some ultra-sanguine, Beach-Boys-meets-Chili-Peppers "ooohs" in tandem with Cary on yet another part.  All thanks to monitors.  Headphones suck.  Meanwhile, the song soon-to-be-formerly-known-as Deerhead remains implacable and mystifying, absolutely refusing to accomodate any of our vocal ideas in spite of the strength of our convictions.  The something-like-four hours we spent wrestling that white whale yesterday left us so downtrodden that the flabbergasting experience of tracking vocals to monitors was the only thing powerful enough to hoist us back up into some kind of optimism.  And I'd like to work on it more today, but I have an urgent date with the television to watch the second-to-last episode of the Sopranos, and as much as I can of the Lakers-T'Wolves Game 2, and another date with the freakin' washer/dryer, as I haven't done laundry in about four weeks, AND a third date with the oven, because Jen finally raved about my awesome oatmeal raisin cookies to her mom one time too many, and now I have to make her a batch.  After all that, I intend to scurry back here to track some serious vox on Come Too Far and Arab Fiesta (also soon to be rechristened).  I haven't been to a movie in a long time.  June will be my movie-going month, as well as, hopefully, my job-finding-and-earning-money-from month, since any lack of such earning will render me financially incapable of touring in July, and that sort of can't happen.  Let's see if that Pix position opens up (pull the strings, Greg! and beware of the big green dragon).  I'd also like to read a book not-for-school soon; I've lately been reading Eagleton while in the bathroom, and that doesn't seem to really qualify as "postgraduate reading" on either count.  Did I really just write that?  Wow.  I think maybe I've said enough.

      For the first time in the history of me, I put down vocals that I think sound really good, and felt good to put down while putting down.  Down puts downy downathan putter.  Having gotten pretty disappointing results yesterday when trying to track vocals for Africa/Welcome home, using our spiffy new Studio Projects B3, RNP & RNC, we all took some time to think about what kind of vocals we want, and how to get them.  I was thinking yesterday that, with my general listening emphasis geared towards instrumentation, I couldn't ever really pick between takes A, B & C of any given song.  I just didn't think I had a good sense of what makes one vocal take - assuming more or less accurate pitch - better than another.  All the more when the takes are my own.  I hear my own voice all the goddamned time.  How am I supposed to have an opinion?  It's like picking your favorite tooth-brushing experience.  Or your favorite television station if your reception only picks up one.  But that changed today, I'm happy to say.  Buoyed by the example of Bjork, we decided to not be so audiophile.  We dropped the condenser for a good ol' SM57, and tossed aside Will and my perennial complaint - HEADPHONES - and turned up the divine monitors we're borrowing from Jon Cohrs, who will also be mastering our record (www.spleenlessmastering.com).  Even with how terrific the room sounds are we've been getting at Gregory Heights, and all of the other exciting developments, tracking vocals without headphones was probably the most revelatory and exciting aspect of this process for me so far.  I could tell what my breath support was like, I could hear my own volume, and my pitch was unfettered by a piece of plastic between my ears and the world.  It was terrifically exciting, and if Africa is any indication, we're heading towards a record we're going to be very, very happy with.  And Chris know his mixing, for sure!  Forgot to eat. Ate.  Watched the West Wing.  And now there's a cat sleeping in my bedroom with Meri.  His name is speedbump.  He belongs to the people who run a recording studi down the street.  Is this a declaration of support for our DIY endeavor?  Or was he just cold, wet and incredibly affectionate...

      Just got back from closing. Got out way early (home by 2:00) after closing at 1:30. Was a pretty slow night. A pair of women came in near the end of the night. One of them was cute. The white of her left eye was partially filled up with blood. I kept wanting to tell her in case it was a symptom of some as yet unnoticed medical emergency, but didn't.  The flap of skin on my thumb is beginning to turn white. First shower and shift without the steri-strips. Its been hurting (and bleeding) a lot less, but I have a feeling its going to get worse at some point before its starts towards totally healed. Had a weird thought during the shift: The thumb wound will be a concrete way of dating time passing from recording. What will it look like at PDX POP? At the end of tour?  All throughout this shift, I was wondering how the songs we recorded in November and spent all that time doing overdubs on -- that are now starting to sound amazingly rich and lush as Chris mixes them -- are going to sound next to the new tracks with their better basic tracks left more raw. Does the new approach really fit the new songs better like we think it does or are we just making excuses to fit the necessities of our schedule? I really do think its the former, but spent the night fretting its the latter.  Going to watch some West Wing (season 2, baby!), drink my Dead Guy, and then go to sleep. Its hard to pretend its a normal night when I'm eager to see how things turn out.

      so we hooked up jon's monitors, and i had the most pleasently exciting mix-time of my life. arab fiesta sounded much more expensive than it actually was. good room, good mics, good pres. on a shoestring. the presonus we've checked out from guitar center translates the low end more clearly than anything i've had a chance to use. so the kick sounds solid and gargantuan. the M/S overheads are phase coherant, as they should be, and the bass sounds great through the oktava 319.   i'm worn out by the process, but driven to continue and continue on this road, 'cause the payoff is so high. everytime i put up a fader and hear the record take shape, with almost all surprises being pleasant, my fatigue recedes a little. i can't wait to hear PS in the room, and then through the mics, and then through the monitors.  time to make evening plans.

      This is my first formal entry on this deal.  I'm Will, and I play the drums in this band.  I thought I could use this blog as a forum to mention that this morning, for the (by my calculation) third time in as many months, I woke up with a totally confounding scratch on my big-ass nose.  It stings like sacred love.  I am reluctant to attribute this to a shaving mishap, simply because I have to imagine that, although such a wound would certainly still hurt the following day, it would doubtlessly have been noticed upon initial infliction.  Also, I don't ordinarily shave my nose.  What I am left with is the only logical conclusion: that on the nights which precede these unpleasant mornings, I am plagued by deeply distressing dreams which involve my own fingernails in some way.  I have to go rustle up some breakfast now, in an effort to fortify myself for another barn-burner of a day hammering out vocals and mixing.  At some point I have to purchase another snare head as well; the one thing Cary failed to mention in his post cataloguing the cavalcade of inconveniences which was yesterday was the abundance of mechanical malfunctions.  Seconds before our first take, my snare head broke (not 100% convinced that qualifies as "mechanical," but who cares), and Cary's Twin Reverb, one day back from its seventeenth visit to the amp shop (efficient!), began producing a brand new problem: inexplicable feedback.  But what Cary didn't neglect to point out was the fact that, upon installing our understudy duo of Marshall JCM 900 and Gregory Heights middle school marching band snare drum, re-tuned and re-mic'ed, we happened upon a killer take.  So all told, I think yesterday bodes well for what is to come.  That was a long paragraph; long enough to remind me that this computer does not dispense Frosted Mini-Wheats.  Until next time...

      Today was one of those good terrible days.  I think we knocked the pants farther off a song than we ever have before, and the room sound that Chris got us on Arab Fiesta sounds like a recording of the inside of the mouth of Yahweh.  Is it just my particular compulsion, or does filling in a text field, beginning on the first line, with no indentation, make other people uncomfortable too?  I have this trouble in word.  There goes one of my allotment of self-conscious meta-blogposts.  Today was the first of what will be many long, productive days in a row.  Will and I worked out some background vocals, and are beginning to piece-together a multi-voice, early-70s, Beach Boys-esque vocal maelstrom from ATHP.  We've never done something like this before, and it's encouraging that we're a) technically able to do so and b) comfortable enough.  It's been nice to see Will understandably more relaxed and laughier than he's been in a while, his graduation just now receding into the aftground.  Aftground.  Ass ground, you ask?  No, aftground.  To justify our feeling great about being successfully self-indulgent recording our own stuff today, it is also worth noting - and in doing so, congratulating the figure in question - that today marked the culmination of several months' worth of serious effort, self-doubt, sleeplessness and selflessness on the part of one Mr. Ethan Chessin - my once and again roommate.  Ethan has been volunteering in the SUN (Schools Uniting Neighborhoods?) program here in Portland for the past while, conducting, coaching and inspiring a 12-person-strong middle school band.  They performed today, and it was glorious.  We recorded it, which is where the we're-entitled-to-feeling-good-about-our-own-crap part comes in.  I'm excited that we'll be able to give copies of their performance to these kids and their families?  I wonder whether they'll be the type of musicians who only hear their performance mistakes on record, or will only hear the pleasure of their experience when listening.  Or, even better, come to love the mistakes.  I'm trying to do the latter.  Onward!  Thanks to Gregory Heights Middle School, Ethan Chessin, Matt of Cart (carttheband.com), and Jeannie for giving us access to the band room for recording purposes.  It beats the hell out of NWRS, and you don't get stuck in so many conversations.  There must be a way to turn recording at a local school into a successful gimmick - particularly in this town.  We thought of naming the record "Gregory Heights", but it doesn't work somehow when one of the band members is named Greg.  DC and Des Moines booked today!  Tomorrow - Paris and Duluth!

      well, i did it. i took it to the next level. i used At Dusk's anomalous basement toilet for #2.  we've got our first big tracking session today (for arab fiesta), so i'm here to make a packing list of mics or channels:  kick: d112  snare: beta87a - ART tube pre/comp; sm57 - on on shell, one on head. experiment with placement to find the sound we want. thickness from the 57, point and room from the beta87a, i think. so back off with the 87a... i've discovered the magic of after-the-fact digital time alignment, so these two snare mics can be disparate distances from the drum.  overheads: m/s matrix of B3 and ??. i will try out all the likely contenders as the mid mic first, and when i get what i consider a stellar mono drum overhead sound, i'll add the side mic of B3. cause othewise i'm afraid i'll be dissapointed in every mid mic for not being up to snuff with the B3. by putting the others up first, i'll be forced to work harder and think harder to get a good sound. hopefully a better sound in the result.  room: camcorder@!!@!  jelly donut: i call it this 'cause i wanna stick a wierd mic in one of the lockers at the band room and shut the door. shure omni.  clean room: matched pair of what we've got leftover in the corners, through the rnp, timed to the track.  bass: di (getting a real di might be the next place to put $$); probably the oktava 319 on the cab, pull it back a couple feet. unless the oktava is the mid overhead, then the c1000?  guitar amp: moded EV dynamic, right on the grille, maybe 219 also for some grangly grit.  CALCULATIONS:  we'll need 6 or 7 mic stands, a snare mic clip, a place to set the camcorder.  cables: 12 mic cables. 2 guitar cables (for camcorder harness)  variables:  which pre's to put the overheads through, presonus or motu - i'll start with presonus 'cause they have the pad, and might be cleaner.  do i have time to shower and change clothes today?

      The back of my throat is on fire, a blank sheet of paper next to my computer says "is now recording. . ." and Chris is shaking his head to Snoop on the other side of the desk -- it must be that time again: the recording of a new At Dusk album. Today: preliminary gear acquisition day (B3, lightpipe input thing (gc rental), cables, etc.) and playing Chris the new songs. Also, he mixed Banana split this after noon and it sound pretty rad. Real starting tomorrow. Watch this space to become part of the future. . .

      And hereby I dive into indulgence!  I guess just using the word "hereby" is pretty indulgent itself.  Speaking of indulgence, I feel the spectre of Nabokov peering down on me, brow furrowed, displeased with my journal-keeping impulse here.  Has anybody read his stuff in "Speak, Memory" about keeping journals just being a way to try to save ourselves from mortality?  That by chronicling the minutae of our lives, we're leaving a monument to them?  What Nabokov wasn't expecting, however, is that while he's peering down on me, brow furrowed, immortality had, I totally just let my bladder go and blow some kidney-processed Mac's all over his face.  This move, subtly distinguished from the golden shower, is from this moment on to be called "The Expatriate."  I expatriate you, Nabokov.   Here we go on our record!  We have some serious weeks of work ahead of us, but I'm feeling more optimistic about this whole thing than I have in a while.  When you guys check in next week, you should expect with almost total certainty for us to be rockstars.  Or at least the president.  Or expatriated on.  Cary

      Just got back from middle of the night Belmont Inn-ing with Chris. Talking about the album, a record label, and conquering the world. We're just starting the recording process and this'll be the place to find out more about that, the big upcoming music festival we're working on (www.pdxpopnow.com), and our nation-wide sumemr tour. -- Greg

      This is the most exciting day thus far in the brief and evolving history of the PDXPOP Now! festival that Greg and I have been working on these past many months.  Case in point: within the past half hour I have heard our festival (July 9-11) and our compilation CD release bash (Thur. July 1) promoted on the air, along with "Turn A Square" by The Shins.  The interesting part about this is that this was all on 94.7 - THE FORMER KNRK!  We are actually making an audible difference and the festival has not yet happened.  KNRK has been the "modern rock" / "new rock" station with a vicegrip on Portland's airwaves.  A Clear Channel clone, a Linkin Park machine.  But, in response to trends in radio, as well as an extensive online listener survery, 94.7 is completely restructuring and repackaging itself - beginning with ditching its call letters.  Their new agenda, as dictated by the audience, includes great DJ autonomy and more local music.  In the past few days 5 TRACKS FROM THE PDXPOP NOW! COMPILATION HAVE BEEN ADDED TO REGULAR ROTATION.  The bands include some with major indies behind them (The Shins, The Thermals, The Decemberists, M. Ward), as well as Matt Wright's label-less Blitzen Trapper.  The potential for 94.7 to bring listeners to good music - let alone local music - is astoundingly exciting.  Hopefully some middle schoolers out there are hearing all this and will pick up a copy of the comp and come to the festival.  Which, of course, makes me wish that At Dusk was on the comp, but so be it.  It just feels good to be making a minor, but still discernible difference in my immediate cultural environs.  Staind is about to played on 94.7, so there's still some room to grow.  In addition, the comp CD release party is a pick in The Mercury (where there's also a full-page, full-color ad for the festival) & The Willamette Week, and articles are coming up this week in pretty much every local publication.  We've actually done this thing. Or we're doing it.  Plus we're going to have falafel at the event, which is tastifying.  "Heights" should be coming back this week.  Tour continues.  Things's looking up.  My skirt.

      Book! Book! Book!  Pop! Pop! Pop!  I spend too much damn time in front of the computer these days to muster the energy and enthusiasm to blog.  Don't get me wrong, I'm in good spirits these days - tour's coming together, PDXPOP is almost here, "Heights" will be shooting out everywhere soon, and the weather is beautiful - it's just that there's quite a bit of stasis involved in achieving this much flux!  Many of my tour booking anxieties have resolved themselves of late.  My initial instincts about which big cities would be hardest to book were completely wrong - I had nothing in California booked until a few days ago.  I hadd to explain how many damn people we know in LA and that they will come to see us.  Especially if we promise them pizza and free decoder rings (I'm not promising that by the way).  New York, on the other hand, has been booked to some extent for a while, with final Tank/Alex plans in the works.  My wish list is now: Chicago, Atlanta, Chapel Hill, Omaha.  Weird how perceptual geography differs from projectionist geography.  Also, Chris has been a good man-on-the-ground gettin Texas booked.  We'll be spending more time in that state than I originally expected, which is good.  It makes it soom more like an international tour.  Set up a show with Paul Bost in LA and one with Eric Hirsch in LA.  Old faces coming out to play.  As Greg has documented, reccently we've spent much time shrinkwrapping and otherwise preparing the PDXPOP compilation CDs for public release.  I placed them in stores in Friday, and several stores have already sold out!  We've known that we have a quality product here - 35 excellent local tracks, 2 discs, for $7 - and it's nice to get some validation from the public.  The official CD release party (the first actual PDXPOP event) is this Thursday.  the festival itself is next week!  WOW!  www.pdxpopnow.com by he way, for the 400th time.  Here is the PDXPOP oddjob I have been charged with for tomorrow:  I will be meeting Organizer Anne at the PDX Red Bull warehouse where I will pick up 36 cases of Red Bull.  I will then drive said 36 cases of energy drink to Oregon City where I will trade them for cases of water which will then be brought back up to Portland for consumption and death-prevention at the festival.  How King's Quest is that?!  I just wish I had time enough to go out and by the new MegaMan Classic series for GameCube (ALL of the original MegaMan games on one disc, including ones never before released stateside)!    Tour sounds fun.

      So, I think the endless-work-march-to-tour has started.  Today, I finished all the errands to allow us to get the  urlLink pdxpopnow  compilation ready to go into stores -- made the signs for the on-counter displays and got them printed at Kinko's, bought full sheet labels for and printed out the barcodes. Also, I ate a crepe from the Crepe Lady.   When I got home, Cary and I put on all of the barcode stickers and then I put the on-counter displays together with their signs and loaded them. They are, all ten of them, sitting in a nice little grid on our dining room table. They look all ready to enter the gridded and shiny world of commerce. A lot of work went into those. A lot of it was ours.  Since then (after a short break to watch two episodes of the West Wing), I've been working on the pdxpop Program while Cary's been working on tour stuff. I think I'm going to take a shower and then get some promotions work done.  I've got cat hair in my eyes from playing with Speedbump on the front porch.

      Spent the afternoon walking around Hawthorne trying to get people to buy ads in the  urlLink pdxpop  program. Had some success, some possible success, and some funny looks. Also, I ate a pear and signed a petition to put a cap on medical malpractice awards on the November ballot in Oregon. I am a productive member both of my elective peer organization and of my country.  Now, I am going to eat milk-fat-sugar producs and absorb some audiovisual entertainment -- err, eat noodles and cottage cheese followed by some "Idaho Spuds" (a weird candy bar I read about in  urlLink Candy Freak  while listening to the abridged version of Bill Clinton's memoir on CD (I got lazy on the hypertext on that one -- and while I already have Amazon open, no less, but I figure that no one's going to be having any trouble finding or finding out about this book right about now).

      called in to the base camp earlier today. the guys had just released thier little bird to fly into the world. cary was battling neuroses, greg computering for relief.  album anti-psychotherapy i attempted to provide, for their masterpiece is mutant. it has grown beyond our dreams, and envelopes even you now, noble reader.  past compare, i still imagine revisions and consequences. could it be that it is growing on me, that i don't want to change the things i hear? always more time could be spent, to rationalize, balance, sharpen, and refine. who are we? producers have many ways of working. as an autodidact, i tend to concentrate on whatever comes to mind, always learning and assimilating, but rarely applying what i've learned. practice, performance?   forward thinking - radically alter working method for the sake of learning. fragments, pieces, goals unwound.

      Like when the computer says 'bing', but with more going to see The Chronicles of Riddick.   Also Cary may end up as king of  urlLink dork ball , which is pretty neat. And  urlLink JC  turned some incrementally greater age than he was amidst a threatening thunder storm and  urlLink work  was slow, but lucrative. Additionally (I'd better stop soon before I run out of those), we've got four friends of Ethan's staying in -- and near -- our house. All in all, not a bad day.

      The new At Dusk  urlLink website  is online. Check it out. You can ever read this blog there. Maybe you are there now and then all of the there's in that sentences should have been here's. Spooky. But, if you are there (or if you go there), you'll have to excuse my big ugly yellow box when you're looking at the blog. It comes from the hack way I'm "syndicating" this blog. Once I figure out a new way (probably involving learning about Atom feeds and parsers and various other painful things), it'll look nicer. I promise.

      Went to see System and Station and the Forth at Nocturnal tonight. Hadn't seen a real show there (though we'd been there for craft night) and had wanted to check out those bands. We ran into  urlLink JC  there out celebrating his birthday with a friend in from out of town. We sat with them and Ryan from  urlLink Lucky Madison , a cool local label that's put out records by  urlLink Talk Demonic  amongst others. Nice guy. Used to be we never knew anyone at shows, but not since  urlLink pdxpop .  Tomorrow, we'll get from JC what will be the final master. And, we'll turn it in to Cravedog, and thus our album will be complete. Not even awkward syntax can make that sound as momentous as it is.  I've also been redesigning the  urlLink website  the last couple of days. Total transformation town. I'll be putting it up before I go to bed tonight. Pretty much just waiting to get some content from Cary after he finishes obsessing about playing the second day of the  urlLink dork fest  finals (he's probably going lose, ending the series, even though he was definitely the Pistons of the series).

      Up until Monday, the last bits of clinging gray refused to be pulled away and then suddenly, today and yesterday, its as if they never existed; a clear warm (hot, even!) summer without warning.  Today, I made significant progress on the redesign of the website. Talked to Speakeasy. Hoping to go online tomorrow night before I go to sleep with a version in which this blog will play a significant role.  We got the second reference master back from  urlLink JC  and listened to it. We are really almost there. I would almost describe what we're doing now as "finishing touches".  Work was slow but steady. Just about perfect excepting getting out a little late.  urlLink Amy  showed up near the end of the shift to carouse. When she's in her up modes, she brightens the room she's in.  For history's sake, I'll post the e-mail to Jon here:  Jon,  We just listened to the reference CD you gave us. I have some notes here for you, but first I just wanted to say that we both thought that you've done a great job and that we're really almost there.  Come Too Far: -First of all, the song sounds perfect. -This is only about the transition: maybe lose three seconds from the end (WCDA could come in at approximately 4:32)  WCDA: -I don't know exactly what you can do about this, but we thought the beginning sounded a little quiet compared with the end of CTF. Obviously the end of CTF is the peak vs. the beginning of this song, which is just about the quietest part. -One thing that might help in regards to this is a comment Chris had about this song is that its okay if we hear the compressor "pump" a little between when there are no vocals and when they are there (which causes such a significant volume differential). Maybe that kind of approach would give permission to get the volume up at the beginning -Contrary to the above, we thought the reduction in compressor distortion between this version and the last was exactly what was needed and we'd like to keep that no matter what happens with the above.  switch: Right idea, but let's not hear the fade at the end of WCDA before You Make Me Worry comes in. Let the first sound of YMMW cut off the hiss of WCDA before fading it out.  YMMW: -Sounds just perfect. Great job!  switch: At the end of YMMW, let the last tom hit decay before the first sound of Farewell Joel Dean starts in (it's this rapidly descending low pitch that the drum made). Besides that, we think the drone at the start of FJD goes on exactly long enough.  FJD: -This song is done. Again, you nailed it.  switch: Nice.  PS: -Whatever the change you made is, its perfect. This song now sounds exactly like it did when we were mixing it and were in love. Maybe the best of the lot.  switch: Nice.  Act of Violence: -whatever you did to reduce the cymbal wash and bring out the bass sounds really good. We're almost there. Maybe just a little further in the same direction.  switch: AoV ends well, but let some of the noise that we gave you before the guitar comes in at the start of Angel be there. Even that little second (or however long you have) would be a nice breath before the start of the song.  Angel: -Totally done. Again, right on.  switch: Perfect.  Tired Eyes: -To our great relief: totally done. At last and despite our mucking around, it sounds great!  switch: Totally not how we were picturing it, but just perfect -- bringing in the trombone as the first sound you hear. We never would have thought of this, thanks!  Welcome Home: -Track marking (when the number switches) should be earlier: when the guitar first comes in, not the drums -Change in bringing out bass is good. More if you can. We are really okay with that drum breakdown being impolite. That's kind of how we wanted it. -Amount left at end is just exactly right.   Overall: We are really close. This version sounded more like how its sounded in our heads than ever before. All the things here are small tweaks. We are betting that the next round will be it.  We can't say it enough: Thanks!  Greg

      So much has happened since Done (2) that I don't even know where to start. I almost feel like there should have been Done (2.1) and (2.2)s.  First: I cleaned the office.  No, I guess that's not a very good place to start since it didn't happen first (more like third or sixth), and is also not the most important things.  Again: Since I last posted: We:  Discovered a mistake in the album art: I'd left off the recording credit. I fixed it, went to Cravedog, spent an hour with Matt sorting things, distilling, chatting, and waiting for progress bars. All of this is going to push back the date for getting the CDs back, but we'll still make the beginning of  urlLink PDX POP , which is the important thing. Then, I came back here and Cary and I went through and waded through a murky world of lost plugins, changed R-eq volume settings and nearly, but not quite identical tracks to generate what will hopefully be the last set of songs that need to go to mastering. We went with: The existing versions of Come Too Far, Welcome Home, You Make Me Worry, Farewell Joel Dean, PS, Angel, and Act of Violence; the new mix of We Could Do Anything that we gave Jon last night, and a new, finally properly corrected, version of Tired Eyes. It seemed at a couple of points like we might go crazy, but I think we came out of it stronger and pretty confident that the tracks are right.  We watched some West Wing and ate dinner and then I just spent the last couple of hours doing booking e-mails for summer tour.  The upside is that the art is out of our hands and the (hopefully final) mixes are off to Jon. Before we know it, we'll be done.

      Food. Me: Cookie Cookie Sunday. Cary: Subway Veggie Sub with bad bread.  Just got back from picking up the digital proof of the album art from Cravedog. Looks pretty darn good if I do say so myself.  Last night we went back in to DP3 on Tired Eyes and figured out that the problem Cary was hearing wasn't so much his nuttiness as the fact that the stereo bounce hadn't obeyed the track automation properly. Turns out that if you bounce after having played the track all, or part of, the way through, then the automation will start with the value that it ended on and move relatively from there. The only way to make sure that you get the proper levels or pan positions or what have you all the way through is to rewind to the start of the track (thus resetting the automated values to their proper starting points) before bouncing. We did that on Tired Eyes and everything became fixed. We did it on We Could Do Anything and the universe revealed itself as being a sane and livable place.  Now, we enter the troubling neurotic/prudent zone where we have to re-output all the other mixes that didn't sound wrong to us just so we can be sure that they're right. We did that last night and now (ten hours of sanity-inducing sleep later) we are going to A-B them with the old mixes so we can see if there are any differences. Then we'll tell Jon about which tracks to go ahead with (in the meantime, he's worked on the new Tired Eyes and We Could Do Anything mixes) and he'll get a reference back to us on Wednesday. Cravedog basically gave us to the end of the week to get the master to them to retain confidence in our ability to get the CD back when we want it.  Anyway, we're on the cusp. I think probably by "Done (3)" or "Done (4)" we may actually be done.

      I gotta get my blogging momentum back up!  I kinda crumbled blog-wise under all of the last minute record arrangements, helping Meri pack up and all that.  So, for lack of original content, here are our final notes to Jon Cohrs - www.spleenlessmastering.com - about what kinds of adjustments we'd like to see made to our mastered album, having heard his first go at it last night.  It sounded quite good, and these few final things will hopefully make it exactly what we hear in our heads.  All the time. Meanwhile, we have our first post-record gig tonight, a benefit for Diane - of Dave & Diane of our practice space NWRS - who, under treatment for a particularly nasty form of cancer, could use some help with her medical bills.  Way to go Oregon!  Without further ado, our mastering notes, in epistolary form:   Jon-  I rounded up Team At Dusk over here and we gave the masters a listen tonight - great work, my man!  We were all delighted with what you did.  We felt that you did a really nice job with frequency management, for lack of a better term.  The whole thing has a nice warmth to it without turning into mud.  So, thanks for that.  Also, the main thing we wanted to see from the mastering - all of the parts sitting more comfortably together - you accomplished spectacularly.  If there is a general comment as far as adjustments go, it's that we would probably be happy to see 5-10% less compression overall (although Come Too Far and You Make Me Worry sound great on that end as is).  Also, thanks for being so responsible timewise and getting these masters to us when we needed them.  Some more detailed thoughts and requests follow:  1) Come Too Far - We thought that the crossfade into We Could Do Anything was awesome, but that it could come 1-2 seconds faster.  That is to say, a second or two less of the white noise/airfilter sound than is currently there would make it even better, we think.  2) We Could Do Anything -This track seemed a tad too compressed, generally speaking - There seems to be a click at the end of the track right now.  In addition to just fixing this with a little fade or what-have-you, we don't really want to hear any digital silence on the record (with one possible exception we'll come to), so if you could make the cut from We Could Do Anything to You Make Me Worry harder/jump-cutier.  There doesn't need to be silence there as far as we're concerned.  3) You Make Me Worry -This track sounds great (the vocals are sitting very well). -Did you boost the bass on this track?  If so, perhaps doing it a touch less. -There's a click at the end of this track right now that can be resolved the same way as the last transition.  Again, no digital silence here - just roll on over into Farewell Joel Dean's low hum.  4)  Farewell Joel Dean -  To elaborate about this transition, we think that the low hum should be 1-2 seconds longer than it is currently (before the "real" instruments come in).  Nice work bringing the birds out in the beginning. -  This was one of the songs that sounded a bit too compressed to us.  Ease off just a bit to allow the vocal stacking that happens throughout to be a little more dynamic. -If there was a bass rolloff on this track, maybe bringing a little more of the bass back in.  It seemed somehow more absent to us than in the mixes for whatever reason.  5)  P.S. -Cut 2 seconds off of the downtime between Farewell Joel Dean and this.  If there is digital silence here, it's fine. -  This song (along with Farewell Joel Dean and Act of Violence) was one of the ones that we felt was too compressed for our taste.  It seems to have buried the vocals on the verses a little much, and brought the high end of the cymbals out into too much of a wash.  If you can back it off a bit, that would be great.  6)  Act of Violence -The transition from PS to this was PERFECT!  Good timing, and we all felt it. -As mentioned above, this seemed a bit too compressed to us.  In particular, the bass seemed a bit absent, and the high-end cymbals (the ride in particular) kind of dominated.   -  If there was a bass rolloff, a little bit more bass would be good.  This might just be a result of the compression mentioned above.  7)  The Face Is That Of An Angel -  There seemed to be a little click on the transition from Act of Violence to this. -  Before the guitar comes in on this song, did we give you any extra spaceship noises?  If so, it would be great to add a second or two of them before the guitar comes in. Maybe a crossfade from the very end of Act of Violence (after the band has stopped and there are those little cymbal tinkles)? -  You were very polite in leaving the 4 minutes of ambient noise at the end of this track.  We just stuck it on there so you could have it to use as you saw fit.  As it turns out, we want it way shorter.  As a ballpark figure, we thought 3:28 of the current mix would be a good place to fade out.  8)  Tired Eyes -This is probably the most annoying comment I have, so be warned. -We did something stupid that we discovered only when listening to your master tonight, so thanks.  We remixed this song largely to bring down the level of the piano.  Unfortunately, when we bounced, we forgot to arm the automation on that track.  So, I'm sorry to say, I'll be dropping off the REAL final mix of Tired Eyes with the automation included for you tomorrow early afternoon (Sun.).  It shouldn't be overwhelmingly different on your end.  Our apologies.   -Our idiocy aside, this song sounds terrific!  9)  Welcome Home -  We think there should be no downtime between Tired Eyes and this.  Tired Eyes has a lengthy "post-song" (the snare rattle, the guitar beating etc.) which we think could crossfade nicely and gently into the opening (guitar tinkle into trombone blast) of Welcome Home here. -  This song seemed a bit too compressed, perhaps.  For example, the bass trombone blast at the beginning seemed louder than the main part of the track.  If it's possible to back off on that a little and still have the volume reasonable and all, that'd be nice. -Was there a bass rolloff here?  If so, if it was because of the trombone at the beginning or the weird loud tom section in the middle distorting or behaving otherwise weirdly, don't worry about.  This parts can sound weird.  The bass guitar seemed a little quieted down here, so if there was a rolloff, more bass would be cool. -The final fadeout on this track - and hence the record - was lovely and elegant.  We loved it much.  Good work!  So, there you have it Jon.  I hope this wasn't too much commentary to give you.  We really liked what you did with everything - these were just the last little nit-picky details.  Thanks for your time and energy - it's really added a great deal to the record.  Give me a call if there's anything to clarify or whatnot.  It's very exciting for us to be at this stage.    Lastly, what do we owe ya?  I'll be sure to get you your remuneration.  You've earned it!  Thanks for your work,  Cary

      Yesterday, we finished mixing. Will came over and we put up We Could Do Anything with the tweaks to the vocals Cary and I had made on Thursday. We played around a little and ended up going back to exactly how we'd left it. We exported and dropped a CD of the last two tracks off at Jon's house before having a nice lunch over at the Detour Cafe and a practice for tomorrow's NWRS benefit show.  All that's left now is to hear the mastering and finalize track transitions. . .

      damn. i could not have imagined that the sound-destructive powers of Sony's VAIO laptop could be so infinite. the 'Tired Eyes' mix that had me shaking with fear that all my decent engineering had been merely a dream, well it sounded just fine coming from my mom's ibook. naive of me to trust a windows machine with audio.

      we need to remix unwater before it hits duplication. can we get jon on the blog for communication? singing along feels good.  i've been listening to the song, (how does 'held for a while now' sound?) and just loving it. but oh jesus does it need to be mixed. i declare my incomplete mix insanity.  first. bring greg's guitar  way down  in from the intro. the tone, in its awesomeness, overpowers the fender. and roll a little bass off?  could be could be so powerful. the piano is too loud.   set the mix: start with all faders down. bring just the overheads to unity. now bring the piano in until it is clearly audible but not overpowering. use different combinations of mikes instead of eq-ing.  now bring in the bass. low, just enough to be felt, from the oktava. roll the low end off the di, and turn it up to conquer the toms in the overheads.  next, vocals.  start with the entry. first line, frank sinatra loud. build the other vocals around it. bus them all to a stereo compressor, maybe the vintage warmer, where you can roll off the lows also. drive to taste.  now the guitars. the most complicated part. i think start by hearing cary's against the vocals, don't worry about letting it fill the sonic space. it will. bring in greg's part, so that it only makes the song a little louder on entry. this one has to build.   now - pull the vocal submix down 'into the mix'. listen again, and  add guitar overdubs. greg's lead into the storm (G3) is the next most important, as far as listening to when adding to the mix. build around that, bringing in the ego-capstone producer lead. you shouldn't have to automate the drums at this point. listen to them, and bring in the rest of the guitars, considering extensive automation of the guitars, other than the two leads mentioned.  change focus. the next critcal element is will's coda vocal level. set this, and vocal panning at the end. now listen from the top, and think about changing guitar levels after the storm.  love on you baby, i'm a wafflehead.  you're almost there. now comes the horrible and necessary part of critiquing what you've done, and making all those minor adjustments that could theoretically rob your mix of all its potency. here, be conservative and wise. if it ain't broke, don't fix it. maybe look twice at your overall vocal level.   that's all i've got for mixing. on the Jon Cohrs front - thanks Jon, for bringing attention to unwater. i think it does warrant a remix. i'm eager to hear what the mastering sounds like on one of the better mixes, maybe Cremasta or ATHP?  working on those monitors was such a gig. thanks again!  as far as singing along goes, i've tried it, and i like it. as far as the unwater (insanity mix) goes, its makes me uncomfortable in such in a way that makes it sound quite punkish. phuey! i guess what it is is that the insanity mix doesn't agree well with being played loud. i hope jon can make all things have passed work well when turned up loud. (all that low end, so fun in the studio, but does it translate?) but cremasta would be nice to hear also. we'll hear them all, in time.

      Things are moving forward on all album fronts, currently. As I type these awkwardly parsed sentences, my slow little scanner is purring its best through some of the slides that Lindsay took on our first day at Gregory Heights. I've been working on the album art. Had a rush and then a disappointment today when a summer monsoon cleared up just as I got home from work -- perfect light for photographing the bird-glass outside. I run out there, get all set up, click and -- bzzt: no film. Citizen Photo was out of Time Zero for the SX-70 when I was there to drop off the other two rolls of black and white that Lindsay shot, so I've got nothing. Maybe, weather permitting, I'll get another chance tomorrow.  I'm using these slides as, possibly temporary, shots of the three of us for the inside of the booklet. I think we've got more lyrics this time around than last time, even with fewer songs. Maybe I'm wrong, but they still seem to take up an enormous amount of space.  We listened to Jon's first go at mastering Tired Eyes last night and today. We like what he did, but mostly we discovered things we want to go back and tweak in mixing. Its a little annoying to be moving back into a stage of the process that we thought was done, but I'm beginning to be able to imagine how good the thing is going to end up sounding so it seems worth it. Chris is afraid that Jon squashed it too much. This is kind of a weird song to start with because it was the most even recording-wise and dynamically.  Anyway, Photoshop is calling my name so I'm off. . .

      For immediate release:  The title of the new, second and executive album by At Dusk is  "Heights"   The record is currently in the gentle and able hands of our PDXPOP friend, Jon Cohrs (www.spleenlessmastering.com), where it is becoming masterful.  We got two alternate versions of Tired Eyes to listen to yesterday, and the results are pretty exciting.  Hopefully, we'll have this puppy off to Cravedog by June 14th, so as to have it in our mitts for tour.  Greg is finalizing the album art today and tomorrow.  Maybe he can post a link to it when it's done.  It's a photograph - a change for At Dusk.  But an At Dusky one.  I've been remiss in my blogging duties these past days - I was in Puget Sound (Camano Island to be precise) with Meri for 3 days in celebration of our 9th (?!) anniversary right after we finished recording, which was wonderful decompression.  You ight have seen that it was recently the lowest tide in a decade in Puget Sound, meaning that all sorts of sea creatures were exposed to us as we walked out onto the Sound that wouldn't normally have been.  Clams and oysters shot 6-ft high streams of water at us.  Heights.  More later.  Many thoughts.  Make you eat em.

      That's it.  That is our final, henceforth immutable, unanimously-agreed-upon album title.  "Heights."  It grew very naturally out of Greg's cover art idea, which centers around a Polaroid of Gregory Heights middle school, where we were lucky enough to record about half of this magnum opus of ours.  I hope Greg will soon post a jpeg of this album cover in an entry of his own, once it's done.  We're finalizing the back cover, the booklet, the typeface, and other such matters which together constitute the visual complement to our auditory madness/genius.  I also listened earlier today to two samples of mastering that Jon was nice enough to provide for us on his FTP server; it seems he mastered Tired Eyes in two different versions, once of which rolled off a bit of the low end to clean up and space out the overall sound at the expense of bass, and the other of which left the bass in, which both thickened and obscured the sound.  We agreed that the former approach yielded the better result.  But it might need a slight retouch on the boards first (everybody do your Biz Markie impression: REMIX!); the piano is deafening whenever it sounds, and my voice, which enters at the end to harmonize with Cary's chorus melody, instead completely overwhelms it.  We've got a different sort of mixing debacle on our hands with We Could Do Anything, whereby it seems that all voices piped through the left-side channel are about 600 times louder than those in the right-side.  Hopefully these can get resolved soon; the other seven songs sound superb, even unmastered (a special nod to Come Too Far and Act of Violence, both of which sound gargantuan), and from what little I got to hear of Jon's work, I think he's pretty splendid at what he does, and we've done wisely to put our product into his hands.  I expect I'm going to be very happy with this work once it's done.

      on the flight back to austin, i debriefed my self on the record-making process. this is an updated and expanded version of that interpretation. i encourage all who participated or observed to extend this discussion. the more we learn the better we can become.  1) more time for vocals  the vocals on this record came out miraculously, especially considering the limited time and concentration we had to develop the material and production values. by the end, though, we were really in a groove. tackling a harmony-heavy track like ATHP was really a good way to become effecient in the process. and the result, executive.  2) more time  always a luxury. but can a surplus bring laziness? at what pace should we record if time were not an issue?  3) write in studio?  the epitomy of studio luxury is the 'writing in the studio' mode of production. the beatles, radiohead... and countless other bands, many of which suck. too much time can breed too much perfection, at the expense of greatness.  4) better ergonomics  sitting on the couch all day, though not without its comforts (thanx for the backrubs, amy!), is not really a long term solution. all in all, i recommend a longer period of preperation for a session. perhaps a chair.  5) grocery shopping  and on that note, some canned soup would go a long way. we ended up buying water and chips, but much of the studio time was spent scared of the chips. how do they make those, anyway?  6) a less-temporary location.  this record was shot 'on location' by a camcorder not running video. we were at the middle-school band room, letting it all out. but then we had to load gear each day for as many hours as we recorded. we got good at it.   staying in one place could have its downsides, both sonic and otherwise. lethargy is one of the feelings that kills a record. you've got to work quickly enough to avoid lethargy. perhaps more time would bring more focus? i'm just beginning to explore the virtues of multiple takes. maybe we should do 50 - like george martin. yes, i do fancy the fab four. is it possible to comp live takes? would require a drum machine. fuck drum machines.  7) days off  to recuperate. sleep on the other-hand, is also a luxury, towards the end.   verdict: having more ti;ll;j['me would be nice, but a deadline doesn't hurt either. ldsal;kasjf [';lasf '[ \ as  asdf;l as f ] [asdf'k   ;asdf;l ]    opj;'  ' [pdoflj ;lkj k]     ' ]    excuse me, i was just practice using the backsace with my pinky. i'm relearning after the carpal tunnel syndrome i've been experienced after long periods of no exercize. keyboard. mouse via usb. i can't believe i didn't think of plugging some of greg's outboard control surfaces. the mouse and the knob. could have saved a lot of clicking, and a lot or wrist twisting.

      Right now: PS playing from open headphones plugged into Cary's computer on the other side of the desk. I'm just running it through (again) to make sure that the 7.7db of reduction that the R-eq came up with is enough to prevent the master fading from clipping. Just at the end there last time it seemed to want to take off another 0.1db.  Spent the day doing a laundry list of album-finalizing tasks. I returned the Avalon's power supply and cable, dropped of Jon's monitors, and now I'm going through and outputting final mixdown's to hand over to him for mastering. -- Hold on, PS is almost over. Yep, it wanted 7.8. Now I have to bounce again. -- Also, I did actual laundry.  In a certain way, this is the most terrifying part of the recording process. The songs are in there, sounding just right, in that silver box and now we've got to get them out. We're involved here in a terrible mass of competing standards and technical definitions (it turns out we should output even our 16bit mixes as 24bit files because it creates more headroom for the summed stereo channels, but while it may matter whether or not we're running at 44.1, 88.2, or 96khz, it doesn't seem like that's a switchable option in DP3 unless you have the MOTU plugged in in which case it seems like it relates only to playback and not to output, and, at least according to Jon it doesn't matter very much.). Not ruining the songs at this point involves successfully navigating a series of endless dialog boxes, pale highlights on soundbites, and invisible cursors. Not exactly the most creative kind of task and not the kind you want to be doing at the end of two of the most exhausting weeks in memory.  At least, tomorrow morning, I'll get to put them in Jon's hands and be done with it. And, best of all, he thinks he can get the mastering done in time for us to get the album back before PDX POP. Its somewhat unbelievable ( urlLink Chris  definitely didn't believe it; he called this morning frantic with a new idea for some pot-banging sound at the beginning of Unwater. I tried to let him down easy; its a hard thing to adjust to the idea that we're done) that we've reached this stage, but before I go to sleep tonight the album will be closed.

      Last night we played a show in Denton, TX, a college town just outside the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. It was about a four hour drive from Austin that we did starting at about  four-thirty. We got to the club right about at nine at the end of our assigned load-in window becuase of difficulties finding the club -- the Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studio and bar -- which was bizzarely located in the middle of the industrial zone on the edge of town.       When we finally got there, the show ended up being about average for tour: a dark divey-looking place that turns out to have some history on the circuit that good bands play (posters for Mates of State, Don Caballero, others), starting late and playing to only a handful of people -- this time aggravated by the fact that this was a college-town bar in the middle of a summer rainstorm. There were, as always, a couple of things that set this show apart: while waiting for the soundguy, we ordered a pizza, not expecting it to arrive until after our set as the club was pretty removed from what passes for Denton civilization, only to have it show up seeminly instantaneously and be quite good: J &amp; J's knows their stuff. The two other bands, The Glass Factory and The Tah Dahs, each had members that qualified as (very) minor indie rock celebrities: Glass Factory bass player had been in Mineral and The Tah Dahs singer/guitarist has played with the Polyphonic Spree. Both bands were pretty good, a strong 7 or 8 each on the scale of the bands we've ever played with.      After the show, we loaded our stuff into the van and headed back towards Austin. It was about 1am and it's a long drive, but we'd been getting to sleep pretty late on each of the previous nights so we figured we might as well do it and have the full day to spend with Chris. When we finally found our way onto the highway going the right direction, it started raining. Or, more accurately, it started raining again, since the condition of the road showed that it'd been raining pretty heavily on and off for a while. The rain built and built, coming down in heavy sheets reducing visibility and roaring as it banged on the van's roof. Then it would suddenly die off for patches between torrents. Each section of the storm was worse than the last, finally forcing me to slow the van to about fifty since I could only see for feet in front of me. A new and exciting danger developed then in the form of speeding towers of light and noise -- big rigs that couldn't slow down safely in the wet and couldm't see small cars (like our enormous, SUV-limo sized van) in the squall. We pulled off the highway, fording a side road ankle deep in water to get to a Mobil travel center and gas station. We took a Polaroid under the gushing overhang overflow and then headed inside, standing momentarily inside the sliding doors shaking our head in disbelief and an attempt to dry off, as would, we'd soon see, every other incoming customer. After using the bathroom (and especially the hand dryer, for cycle upon cycle) and wandering around the inensely-white-lit store staring at candy and leafing through Maxim, FHM, and Smooth (the particularly excellent latino version), we sloshed back out to the van to decide what to do.      After a discussion with a kindly highway patrol officer with a deep and wide scar on his left cheek about road conditions and a vote of two-to-one, we decided to drive over and park in the McDonalds parking lot to sleep until sunrise. We called Chris to leave a voice mail telling him not to worry about our absence. Just after getting off the phone, as we were settling into our cramped quarters in the van and preparing to grouse about the flood lights in the parking lot, there was a particularly forceful blast of lightning and all of the ourdoor lights went out within our field of sight. We slept fitfully for about three hours in the half-gloom.      After a relatively uneventful, if wet, morning drive (featuring a particularly pleasant listen to Mingus' Ah Um) we arrived back, alive, at Chris's apartment and fell on the floor asleep. Now, food and some solid loungin' hours later, we're getting ready to go see I Robot. We probably won't tell you how it is.

      So, this internet thing has been much more elusive on tour than one might have expected. Traveling around this big unwired country we've had few opportunities to broadcast our doings in the charming if quirky way that might be expected.    Now, we're in Austin, sitting in the cafe just under Chris's balcony -- The Spider House. I just finished my espresso milkshake and so am revved up to start catching up on some of the events of the couple of legs. I've got a bullet-pointed list of everything that's happened in my little black moleskin book, but maybe I'll page through for selected highlights and articulate them here as anecdotes, with the bullet points only for context:    17 July  -up at 1 at Carol's  -lunch at Taqueria Cancun  We walk down the street and through an intersection towards 826 Valencia, Dave Eggers' so-called "independent pirate supply store" in the Mission. We pass the clutter of mid-height, pale-colored, dirt-crusted  buildings, cross an intersection and see a strangely pristine, new storefront with the words 826 Valencia in gold letters on the purple front and a towering front decorated with splindly pseudo-architectural drawings. This is 826 Valencia.   We stand for a minute in front of the display window trying to decode the meaning of this white-washed skeleton leaning over a cracked wooden chest wearing a red t-shirt and a misty expression. There are Russian vocabulary cards on the floor. and costume jewels strewn about.  We go inside to find an space not entirely unlike the interior of a giant gilded oak cabinet. There are displays of small rings and other knicknacks with magnifying lenses infront of them. Above this viewing station, a large box hands ominously, it's bottom door tied to a thick braided rope that curves back behind the counter. As we walk around the periphery of the small room, we come across a series of inset drawers with cryptic labels. "Crushing" reveals a series of marble mortar and pestles. We find piano hammers, a box of scarves, small pirate figurines. Also cut into the walls are a series of dioramas, like Cornelll boxes without the glass they seem to illustrate obscure moral lessons.  Amongst all the books and tourist daubles, we find old copies of Might, Eggers' magazine that plays prominently in A Heartbreaking Work. I browse through a small novellalette of his about a fictional Orange County politician while listening to the kids writing class being held in the roped-off back area which extends oppulently off the store. We buy some small things, including the "Goals" sign Cary mentioned in an early post, chat with the girl behind the counter about the David Sedaris live album playing in the store before heading back out into the city.  The trap over the jewel display is never triggered in our presence.  -an hour break  -drive to the Hotel Utah  -unloading  -watching the other two bands soundcheck  -getting set up  -a short wait  -Carol shows up with about ten of her med. school friends  set:      You Make Me Worry      The Image      Angel      PS      Reid's Song      Starman  -we cut Deep End due to time  -Will and Jen head out to go to a party of Jen's friends  We head up to the balcony area that hovers in the middle of the Hotel Utah, dividing the sunken stage section in half. We chat for a while with Carol's friends while One Ring Zero, the next band sets up. We head down to the bar and manage to weasel some garlic mashed potatoes and warm spinach salad from them despite the kitchen being closed. One Ring Zero takes the stage: a drummer with a box drum for a throne, an accordionist, and a Clavinettist -- a kind of accordion that one blows into through a straw poking out the top. Their songs all have lyrics by famous authors, commissioned explicitly for the purpose: Paul Auster, Lemony Snickett, Michael Chabon (actually, they used his rejection letter), Margaret Atwood, etc. They had some kind of connection to Fresh Air, either a segment about them, or their participation in a segment about the Clavinet. No surprise, they were from Brooklyn.  -Las Pesadillas (Jewish-folk violin-tinged rockabillly)  -loading our stuff back into Cary's car  -a homeless guy comes by saying he just got done working "security"  -drive back to Carol's  -meeting her there after she takes the bus back from the bar with her friends  -sleep    End day 1. Maybe future entries shouldn't be this long, but there won't be as many pirate supply stores to describe so that shouldn't be a big problem.

      4:15 am: the phone rings. it's will, calling to wake me up. the guys had just got off the highway and needed some further direction. i talked them through it, and then stood on my porch, where hank was sleeping, and listened to the squealing and laughter coming from spiderhouse. soon flashbulbs began to pop. i peered through the window, but saw no titties.   soon enough, at dusk rolled up in a stretch-van. we joked about bugs and big stuff and stuff, and then i fell asleep.   today i saw the record for the first time - it looks real. like even realer than the last one. so tonight, you go to the Hole in the Wall, and listen.

      Man, I tell you, blogger is not always to be trusted.&nbsp; You notice those blog posts with no text?&nbsp; Yeah, there's supposed to be text there. I should know - I wrote it.&nbsp;In fact, it's so untrustworthy it'll probably remove this section of my post in horrifying, dystopian HAL-ish fashion.&nbsp; We could always defect to the Portland-based livejournal...Do you hear me BLOG?  Anyhow, we've been remiss in our blogging duties more or less since PDXPOP started, running all the way through to now.&nbsp; Now is July 22.&nbsp; We are in LA, having played our 4 California dates for our friends and family. And superfans, of course.&nbsp; Tonight&nbsp; I go to dinner with my family, tomorrow I go visit camp after picking up our newly requisitioned 15-person passenger tour van.&nbsp; We will post the following text in our van, purchased in the form of a weather-worn flyer&nbsp;at 826 Valencia, Dave Eggers' independent pirate supply shop located in the Mission in San Fancisco:  Goals: 1) Plunder. 2) Meet new people. 3) Learn valuable new skills.  And now I shall begin a fragmented recounting of the past weeks.&nbsp; One bite at a time, luckyduckies.

      So, it's pretty late, I'm pretty tired, and I left my little black book with all my notes from which I was planning to construct a witty and fascinating account of our first almost-week of tour at Cary's tonight after our show -- weird being here and, particulalry, there where we've so often been while not on tour -- so I can't regail you with all of our adventures thus far along the road. I thought that as a teaser, I'd give you this. It's an e-mail a friend of ours from high school sent tonight explaining why he missed the show. I will preface it only by saying that we were sad not to have seen him tonight and that I have no strong feelings about the story's veracity. When it comes to Derek, nothing surprises:  ---------- Forwarded message ----------From:  urlLink derekforj@aol.com   >Date: Thu, 22 Jul 2004 04:21:17 EDTSubject: Re: At Dusk - Intranational TourTo:  urlLink cary.clarke@gmail.com ,  urlLink will_hattman@hotmail.com ,  urlLink greg_borenstein@hotmail.com   Dear Cary, Will, and Greg,   Around 7:30 tonight/last night both the people I was gonna bring toyour gig with called and cancelled - one with a 'cold' and the otherwith girlfriend issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;So at around 8:15 I set off on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;After45 minutes of waiting, three metro busses, and a seven block jog Ifinally made it to the Big Foot lounge around 10:05.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, youall played there yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me about 20 minutes to figurethat out that I had mixed the up the venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be deterred Iimmediately phoned for a taxi, which took a half hour to get there,and ordered the cabby to high tail it to the Silverlake lounge!&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboutfifteen minutes later he dropped me off next to 'Graceland' which, inhis defence, is a lounge in Silverlake just not the right one. Fortunately Graceland wasn't too far from my actual destination, onlyabout a mile, and with the directions the friendly Graceland doormangave me I was able to jog to the Silverlake lounge in under tenminutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, by the time I got there - 11:15 - you all,paul bost and his band, and everyone else had already hightailed itout of there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having blown all my money on covers, bus fare, andtaxicabs I was forced to walk home through Hollywood - a journey thatincluded a lengthy discussion with a homeless man from Sioux City,South Dakota who wouldn't stop following me and brief incident where Iwas mistaken for a male prostitute by two extremely high women intheir forties driving a sports car that looked to have been crashedboth frequently and recently.So while I didn't exactly make it to your show, it wasn't for lack oftrying.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you guys played a great set. I'm really sorry I missedit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck with the rest of the tour and please let me know thenext time you play L.A.  your most exhausted fan,  Derek.

      As Will mentioned below, before I unwittingly upstaged his post with my PDXPOP party post:  Our 2nd album "Heights" is now available for public consumption!  We've got 1000 of these babies burning a whole in our basement.  If you're smart, you'll get a copy now, as we're likely to sell out before this time tomorrow.  I mean it.  Such disparate figures as Kofi Annan, Saddam Hussein, Bismarck, Dracula and Sir Toby Belch have already placed advanced orders.  We'll give you a copy cuz we want you to hear it.  Of course, we wouldn't refuse $5 from you if you offered it to us as a token of your support.    WAHOOO!!!!!  Looking forward to sharing this with all you folks as we merrily roll along in a matter of weeks...  P.S.  I've been trying to post this message for 5 damn days.  What's up with blogger?

      Despite the images that the title of this post may have conjured for you, this deals with a less corporeal experience, but one no less ecstacy-inducing!  Last night (July 1) was the first actual PDXPOP event.  We had a CD release party for the PDXPOP Now!  2004 compilation CD at Holocene here in Portland.  We were feeling pretty optimistic about the event, as we'd had some good press in the week leading up to it. But the reality of the event far surpassed our expecctations.  IT WAS AWESOME.  We had 280 paying customers, each of whom received a free copy of the comp with admission.  However, we went through somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 CDs, 6 hand-screened-by-me-and-mostly-Greg tshirts and a ton of raffle tickets.  By any criteria, this was an unqualified, bonafide sellout of a success.  It was a room full of Portland hipsters, but somehow there wasn't any hipster attitude in the room.  It felt like a community.  It felt like a city.  It felt like people gave a shit about what we've been puring our hearts into for the past many months, which was extremely gratifying.  If last night was any indication, the festival itself - next weekend - should be amazing and uplifting for all.  And much more press to come this week...  If there's a downside to all this, it's that we're out of the 600 CDs we'd earmarked for retail and public consumption.  we'll have to reallocate, and perhaps re-order.  Certainly nothing worth crying about.  Will and I had a good talk at the party last night.  Just revisited the fact that we've been friends for a long time and appreciate each other in both that capacity, as well as collaborators, no matter what friction we experience from time to time.  Mostly, we're just getting excited for tour, something we've all dreamt about for most of our lives and, consequently, want to enjoy as it happens as much as possible.  So, yes, the marathon of exciting AtDusk/PDXPOP occassions has begun.  Perhaps this record should have been called The Summer of Promises Kept.  Speaking of which, here comes another post...

      ... and I've just received word that Heights is finished.  Back from Cravedog.  Saints be praised!  Greg and Cary are picking up our run of 1000, I will rendezvous with them to help unload the cases, and then we will have copies upon glorious copies to distribute far and wide.  I'm going to see David Schiff's new piece premiered in Kaul tonight at 8.  Anyone wanna tag along?

      So amid crippling stomach problems yesterday, most likely anxiety-related due to upcoming tour and absence of girlfriend, I went down to Holocene around 10:00-ish to check out the PDXPOPNOW compilation CD release party.  With a $5 cover and a free copy of the CD for all attending, it was packed.  Absolutely packed.  There must have been 400 people there.  I was stationed behind the raffle-table with Greg and at the door with Cary for most of the event, and I watched the count of CDs rapidly, rapidly dwindle.  It was pretty remarkable.  At the time that I left (about 1:30), there were a total of about eight CDs left ALTOGETHER, including the ones given out to stores (which, by the way, have been selling like wildfire themselves).  This is eight left from a pressing of a thousand.  Larry Crane was shitting a brick.  I haven't blogged in a while, and was eager to jump back on, and I consider myself in a unique position to post on this matter because I haven't spent the last three months utterly committed to the architecture of PDXPOPNOW, and entrenched in all the concomitant planning and grunt-work, as my bandmates have.  Last night brought my first taste of the PDXPOPNOW experience, and I was thrust violently into the reality of what a big deal it is.  Somehow, despite all the scuttlebutt, and the supposed prominence of the comp's tracks on KNRK (I say supposed because I have still not tuned in to confirm), I remained pretty much in the dark about what a phenomenon this initially little idea had turned into.  It took a first-hand visceral interaction with the monster itself to wake me up.  It's really taking the whole scene by storm, and we're right at the epicenter; lucky us!  So in other news, Ethan won a gift certificate to Reverb at the raffle last night, and Lucas and Katherine won a messenger bag stuffed with a book about the history (?) of Doc Marten boots.  I had two tickets in hand, and naturally was holding out for the 5 hours of free Jackpot! time, but ended up leaving before the announcement, and entrusting my tickets to Greg.  I get the feeling if we'd won, he would have e-mailed me.  It was not to be.  Also, Ethan was going around asking everyone he ran into if they could remember the plot to "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."  I realized, in a moment of panic, that it had been literally sixteen years since I'd read that.  All I could pull out of mental mothballs was that it involved a wise old Teiresias-like rat named Nicodemus.  Anyways, to conclude: with a turnout of over 400 at the comp release party (21-and-over, $5 admission), I can only imagine what kind of throng will beat down the door of the three-day event itself (all ages, free of charge).  This will undoubtedly be the biggest show of our puny little lives, even if our set does begin at 2:40 in the afternoon.  Pretty thrilling.  In other news, I'm lockjawed with anticipation about the prospect of tour.  I can't contain my excitement.  We just booked a show on the 17th in SF, which then would necessarily take us out of Portland on the 16th, and would give us the 18th to just idly soak up the city, unless we end up booking something in Sacramento for that day.  Then we've got another gig on the 19th, and then two on consecutive days in LA: the 20th and 21st.  This is all pretty overwhelming.  To play a show in LA at a venue that is neither the Natural Fudge Co. nor my garage has been a dream for a good long while.  Did you hear about Brando's death?  That came as a shock to me.  I guess I didn't realize he was as old as he was.  He always just kind of seemed indestructible, which I guess was an impression that stemmed from that almost other-wordly strength and potency that he tended to radiate in his performances.  Also, I've just woken up, I mean minutes ago, so if none of the above makes even the slightest smidgen of sense, I can only be blamed inasmuch as I decided it'd be wise to blog immediately upon waking up.  So I guess that means I can be blamed entirely.  Shut up.

      Here's a nice little piece on us from the Nashville, TN weekly:     AT DUSK  This Portland band insist they're not being facetious when they say they're influenced by Philip Glass and Romanian Gypsy music as much as by their more obvious indie- and post-rock antecedents. Despite their fluency in sounds that reflect the dour reserve typical of the latter, At Dusk distinguish themselves with a sunnier outlook, which they maintain even when their lyrics are nakedly revealing. Without overplaying their offhand sense of humor, songs with suggestive titles like "You Make Me Worry" and "Act of Violence" stay afloat instead of sinking under the weight of the band's attitude. A trio with one former music student and the two others with some formal training, At Dusk sound very much like students—they poke, pluck and prod at horns, xylophones, cymbals, guitar strings and the like such that the craft in their writing recedes behind a veil of wonder but ultimately isn't lost.

      Tucson is a medium-sized college town in Arizona populated mostly by ninjas. Said ninjas are attracted by the sounds of post-hardcore / post-metal music madness. Upon hearing the aforementioned music, these teenaged ninjas form a circle and begin to parade around, looking at one another, eyeing each other with vague aggression, swinging their puffed-up chests from side-to-side like Looney Tunes gorillas. Upon hearing a musical cue that only the adept ninjas are immediately sensitive to, these ninjas flip the fuck out. They spin-kick like the brothers in Final Fight. They seem to teleport from one place to another like MegaMan at the beginning of a level. They swing all inanimate objects around wildly towards each other, occasionally making contact. They stomp their legs one after the other, windmilling their opposite arms simultaneously.  This is the most amazing dancing I have ever seen.  Apparently it's the standard in such musical circles nowaday, but I'd never seen it. In one of many chance, inevitable, small-world encounters on this tour, I saw this phenomenon in action to the tunes of Bleak December. I learned that this was the band's name when I ambled on over to the merch table, where it rang a bell in my mind. Bleak December....aha! One of my ex-campers was, last I had heard, playing drums for a semi-pro neo-metal band, and this was it. How odd to meet in Tucson! Unfortunately, he and the band had parted ways a few months before, or we might have had quite a reunion.  Additionally, some dude noticed my Joggers shirt and a smile came across his face. Apparently, though now in Tucson, he'd helped them book a show back in Illinois and asked me to pass his CD on them at next meeting, which I will hopefully remember to do.  This all, as well as our gig, took place at Tucson's all-ages venue called Skrappy's. We were all really taken with the kids at this place. We played on what turned out to be, at least nominally, a "battle of the bands" night, although no battling took place aside from ninjas v. ninjas. There were 8 or so bands, none of whom bore any stylistic resemblance to the others. And the kids sat there and listened to them all. Including us, though they had surely never heard of At Dusk. They were jovial and responsive and helped us have a great time. In fact, we've had a hell of a lot of great times on tour so far. I write this now in my Aunt &amp; Uncle's place in New Orleans, where we had an off day to explore the city. More on that later. I hope nobody minds the lack of temporal organization here. Think of these as snapshots.  Thanks to Mike Wolin and his friends Megan and Jen, who graciously housed us in their shockingly unstudent-like apartment in Tucson.  Onward to Nashville tomorrow!

      Here is a fun game you can play while cranking through the last putrescent vestiges of the Fountainhead. 1. Give yourself an interesting megalomaniacal moniker. For example, let's use the Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth. 2. Introduce this name into normal everyday things that people do.  We obtain such gems as... "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth is having a chicken sandwich for lunch." "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth just checked his rearview mirror before changing lanes; this is the perfect way to change lanes." Some people enjoy poop, so we have "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth is now pooping in a hotel bathroom."  If you mix instant coffee with instant hot cocoa, the result is a good result.  What's the story with Don DeLillo? I just read Cosmopolis. I was significantly less impressed by this work than by, say, Cryptonomicon. In fact, Cosmopolis sounded very much like the book that Kivistik would write about the Information Superhighway. Thoughts?

      So, before yesterday the best news story I'd ever heard on NPR was on late at night (around midnight) when they play BBC selections from all over the world. There was this story from Germany. Here was the story: It seems a man had a life long desire to kill and eat a person. Just any person would do. He made it into his forties or fifties as a normal work-a-day German. At that point, he started to advertise this desire on various web services. He got a series of applicants. He corresponded with them. More than one of them came out to his house (he lived outside of the city) for a meal and an "interview," leaving completely unharmed when they turned out not to be completely sure of their decisions. Don't worry though, the story has a happy ending. Eventually, he found a man who passed all his test. They eat dinner together. Had wine. Then, our hero calmly killed the man with a knife. He stabbed him in the chest. I like to picture this part something like that scene near the end of Saving Private Ryan with the hand to hand combat. He then, proceeded to eat part of his guest, saving him for later. How do I know all this? How did it end up on the BBC? He was being tried for murder and his defense was that it was a mercy killing, on a level with assisted suicide -- a punishment, in Germany, which, apparently, only carries a small monetary fine, as opposed to the life jail sentence associated with murder -- and the defense submitted a video tape of the whole endeavor. I don't remember what the verdict turned out to be (you can read about it  urlLink here  if you want to know, but I'll warn you that the print version strips away the folksy charm that the BBC radio version had and that I've been trying to impart here), but it wasn't the full sentence for murder. At the time, I just thought that this was so great because it's such a moral quandry. Was what this man did wrong? If so, how wrong? Is it akin to not helping a suicidal person who comes across your path, or of hunting down a victim to murder? Should it even be illegal?  Anyway, yesterday, I heard a totally unrelated story (except for the fact that I think it also took place in Germany) that might surpass the German cannibal for pure weirdness. Apparently, scientists in Germany have discovered a gene that controls the point when muscle growth stops. Or, more acurately, they discovered a gene that (if you have both copies, it's recessive), makes it so that you don't generate the hormone that tells your muscles to stop growing. They discovered this because of. . .an incredibly strong baby. A super baby. This baby has the gene from both parents and so no hormone inhibits the growth of its muscles. It (he?) is four years old and can lift eight pounds with each arm. Picture a baby, or a little kid, with lots of muscles.  Anyway, in school I think part of the reason we listened to NPR 23 hours a day was because if you listen enough, eventually you hear it wander out past the edge of sensible reality into areas like these. You can always tell its happening because of the audible delight in the voices of the program hosts. I remember lying in bed late at night and laughing listening to an hour long program about "caravans" (campers) on the BBC. It just went on and on into all of this rediculous detail about caravan culture and sales and trends.   I guess hearing the story about the super baby with lots of muscles made me nostalgic for those moments. Half of the fun of them is sharing.

        I don't know if you guys have seen this yet, but the Supreme Court just handed down a decision that blocks the Child Online Protection Act from taking effect.  This act would have required sites containing "objectionable material" to use age verification before allowing users access to said material.  The Supreme Court said, in a 5-4 split, that this was too restrictive, and it wasn't clear that the onus of protecting children from porn needed to be on the webmasters, rather than on the individual users.  This seems like a relatively "liberal" decision, so it makes sense that among the majority were Ginsburg, Souter, and Stevens (pretty consistent liberals), and Kennedy (probably the most liberal conservative on the court).  But I think that it is funny that the majority in a case about preserving easy access to pornography was rounded out by...wait for it...Clarence Thomas.

Cameron, why on earth are you continuing this deathmarch through the shitmonster? I doubt it's going to pick up around like page 600 or so. And anyway, if I recall correctly, the Objectivist Club is annoyingly present at Berkeley. They can probably tell you how it ends. And then yammer on about how if everyone just listened to the white man, everything would be peachy keen, or something like that.  Also, Chuck and Buck had flaws. Therefore, it totally sucked. And I reserve my right to vituperate stuff that totally sucks. Though I do actually like Mike White otherwise.  Yogurt + Raisins + Total = Tasty. Odwalla Lime Quencher = Gross

      Not all of you already know this about me, so I felt I should share. It's true. Ayn Rand sucks my ass. With syrup. Lapping it up with those sickly, scrawny cracker lips of hers.  Btw I'm trapped now somewhere in The Fountainhead. Nearer the end, thankfully. A more apt title of this "raving shit-monster" (thank you, Will, for that turn of phrase) would be something like "A Study of the Mating Habits of Ubermenschen in their Natural Habitat" or perhaps "The Ubermenschen Fuck, Too!" Some others that I have considered include "Fuck Nature!... Huh? Fuck You, Too!" and "My Piss-Poor Philosphical System Also Produces 'Raving Shit Monsters' in Literature!"  For some time now, a sci-fi/fantasy author by the name of Patricia Morrison-Kennealy has had the distinguished honor of nibbling my black asshole with Mensa-tested cracker lips. But now, a challenger has come, the challenge laid, and White Womanhood has found a new, and far greater, Syrupy-Ass Sucker.

      Will, since I assume you're pretty busy on the tour, I'll take on the whiny Laker fan role for a moment. It seems Vlade Divac has signed on as the Lakers new center. I have to say, I'm a little conflicted about this. On the one hand, Vlade is a true center (a rarity these days) and a terrific passer. Seems like a good addition to the team. On the other hand, he's also sort of a douchebag. What to think then? A real quandary.  Hope the tour's going well.

      Does anyone recall at time when we used to be able to distinguish between atomic (i.e. fission) bombs and "nuclear" (i.e. fusion) weapons? I have no special knowledge here, but I find it hard to believe that Iraq/Iran/North Korea are on the verge of producing fusion-based weapons, as it took the US and USSR an extra 15 years or more to figure that out even after the A-bomb dealio. For that matter, I think Pakistan and India are still working with atomic weapons. I think the distinction is as important as, say, the difference between a 5 megaton and 40 megaton explosion.  By the way, has anyone heard from Lt. Mikey recently?

      This cracked me up so hard I had to share it; for no particular reason, I was jerking around on iMDB and came across the page on American Pie.&nbsp; The featured review, the one that appears at the top as selected by iMDB staff, was the work of a Jack Christal-Gattanella, of New Jersey.&nbsp; And this is how it begins: &nbsp; "American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on conservative levels. And that can be summed up by one word as does not not work for conservatives- Pie." &nbsp; OK, so, what have we learned?

      So the latest in Laker developments is that we've re-signed Kobe (which is quite a blessing, considering what we fucking sacrificed to placate his court-bound ass), and then we promptly lost Derek Fisher to the Warriors.&nbsp; That's how unrestricted free agency works.&nbsp; They made him an offer of $37 million over 6 years and he said yes.&nbsp; I'm really, really going to miss him. &nbsp; I guess the role of sports analyst (or, more specifically, whiny Lakers fan with breaking news) on this blog has gone to me.&nbsp; I'm happy to take it; I'm often without Norwegian public sex act stories or revelations about the origins of Jim O'Rourke songs.&nbsp; And any political treatises I might offer would doubtless echo the many already put forth. &nbsp; Also, we're leaving for tour in fourteen hours.&nbsp; It's rather ungoddamnedbelievable that this is actually upon us.&nbsp; And Jen should be home in about twenty minutes, so that's another reason to be happy.&nbsp; I expect I'll see every one of you FPS-ites in the next six weeks!&nbsp; Especially Cary and Greg.

      It looks like we can kiss Shaq goodbye.  Trading season doesn't officially open until Wednesday, but apparently all parties have agreed to a trade that will send that fucking obese ingrate to Miami in exchange for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, and a draft pick.  Those guys can produce in the middle, right?  Nothing to worry about?  I would be weeping over this turn of events if not for Shaq's irredeemably callous attitude toward the Laker organization and the entire city of Los Angeles, which erupted so suddenly after our loss in the Finals.  Guy's an asshole.  He's burning every bridge.  Fuck him.  Let the mosquitoes have him.

      A couple of Norwegian music fans face court action after they stripped off and had sex onstage during a rock concert.  Tommy Hol Ellingsen, 28, and his girlfriend Leona Johansson, 21, say  they did it to help save the rain forest. Public sex  is illegal in Norway.  According to Norwegian TV’s Nettavisen, the pair  are members of an organisation called Fuck For  Forest which is dedicated to having sex in public places in order to save the environment.  During a show for Norwegian band  Cumshots on Tuesday, the pair walked onstage, asked ‘How far  are you willing to go to save the world?’, took their clothes off and got jiggy with it.  The band continued to play as the couple had full intercourse.  Police fined the couple £850 each but they are refusing to pay and now face a full court case.  "It is ridiculous that we are prosecuted and  sentenced on a moral basis at the same time as Norway is in the war against Iraq," said Ellingsen.  The last time the couple staged a public sex act, they raised $10,000 for their environmental aims.  However, no environmental group was willing to accept the donation.

      Many of you may, like me, love the song "Women of the World" "by" Jim O'Rourke. I put "by" in quotes because it turns out that it's a cover. I am, right now, listening to the weird  urlLink orginal  courtesy of this cool  urlLink music blog  in and about Potland. The song turns out to be by someone(s) named Linda Hirst and Ivor Cutler (who?). Weird. Weird. Weird. O'Rourke's version is still a billion times better, but it's like finding out that In My Life was written by some Tin Pan Alley wonk you'd never heard of.  In other news, I made a new friend today: a new co-worker who plays the harp, has a dog, a cat, and two chickens, and lives in an old storefront into the walk-in refrigerator (no longer operational) of which she plumbed a bathtub (I'm not really sure about the verb conjugation in that sentence, but can we really be sure of anything in this topsy-turvy world?). Neat to meet new people and have them turn out to be weird and interesting instead of boring and lame.

      Did you guys realize that all boy animals have penises, and all girl animals have vaginas?  Isn't that funny?  Sorry not have contribued to the larger dialogue lately.  As those of you who have been reading Blogging Open Martin (the At Dusk blog), we've been quite busy up in Portworld these days.  Our new record is out (Heights), our festival is happening this weekend (PDXPOP Now!), and our crosscountry tour begins in just under two weeks.  This is all really exciting.  The busiest 6 months, for sure, since I graduated.  But I'm feeling pretty damn good about things right now.  I think we all are.  Especially the Iraqis and Sudanese.   Those guys are party friggin animals.  So what do you guys all think about Edwards as the pick?  I think it was the right choice for Kerry, but - without knowing as much as I'd like to about him - I wish Richardson hadn't been so quick to bow out.  But I'm hopeful about that stuff, too.  What's new with you guys.  Cameron, to allay your fears, I (we all) read your blog, as well as yours Tyson.  If you all started blogs, I'd wager we'd read those to.  Speaking of which, this brings us to the issue of "lost alumni."  Who knows what's up with these folks?:  Mike  Mikey Bernie Sam Ben  I don't know and I'd like to.  Meri, for the record, is gallavanting around Norway right now, leading a wilderness trip.  We'll meet up with her in CT on tour in August.  She will then move down to SF for UCSF to become MDMD.  She's having fun I'm sure, and has a lot to be excited about.  So who of you do we get to see when we're on tour?  The itinerary is still developing, but you can see what we've got on the webpage (and I'll post it here, too).  Also, if any of you feel beneficent, we'd love to be able to sleep on your floor if we come through where you live (excepting LA, where we'll sleep in our own goddamned beds, thank you very much).  Except, Cameron, I think we're just missing you in the bay, no?  Anyhow, I hope you're all well.  Speak here!  Speak now!  Be here now!  Give strangers blowjobs!

      Alan Keyes must be--and bar-none, including P. Diddy, Cash Money Mob/Mafia (whatever), and all the other strapping black fuckers who make a point of showing off the refrigerator contents and the bedroom where "the magic happens," "the shit goes down," etc--the single most ridiculous, pathetic creature I am actually aware of. My opinion may turn tomorrow, but I wouldn't count on it. This is a putz who is somehow physically capable of claiming, on national broadcasts, that race had nothing to do with the Republican party selecting him to run against Obama. What kind of crazy-monkey-talk is that? Even Hastert had trouble keeping a straight face when asked about this, claiming something like "he wasn't actually there" when the decision was made. Remarkably, Keyes also claimed that he was chosen because of the unique set of skills that he brings to the challenge, which included the  ability  to take the race issue off the table--but that has nothing to do with being black. (I refer the reader to my published views of Objectivistic crazy-monkey-talk.) Subsequently, Keyes first salvo against Obama took the form of  urlLink "likening [Obama's] pro-choice stand on abortion to a 'slaveholder's position.'"  Whaaa? I have all sorts of sick images of crayola "flesh" colored ass-invading dildos running around in my head.   Okay, I'm just vituperating for the sake of it. I like "crazy-monkey-talk" though.

      Has anyone else seen Garden State? Here is a movie with definite flaws, but I think I still really liked it.

      Check out this  urlLink article . Apparently, Mamta Popat is a pretty common name in Arizona.
