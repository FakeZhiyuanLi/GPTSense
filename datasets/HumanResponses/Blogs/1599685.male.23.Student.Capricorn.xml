						   imma take this opportunity to finally release any of the scattered thought patterns lying dormant in my mind. so much seems to change or happen in such a short amount of time, that i find it hard to keep up with it sometimes.  it's hard knowing where to begin or express how you really feel about certain things.  so this will be a place where i come to meditate on any and everything in an attempt to break free from my writers block.    “Ink” In the heart of darkness  and the cool of night My ink takes flight  Black like night upon white Write to release light  Shine bright  In the heart of darkness And cool of night     Till next time. Stay real and righteous with the written word.  Knowledge Reborn

						    Still impressed to see the light  for the life of me... Though my mind star see far in the darkest of nights we bleed hard times got my mind  scattered and scared but i stil see the art in a beating heart the part that pumps  the positive patterns we are    First and foremost...   -- In my opinion  urlLink Saul Williams  if anyone fights to see the light...for 3rd eyesight to be free, it would be him..So i sugesst you got get this book  SHE    Here is an excerpt:   i presented my feminine side with flowers  she cut the stems and placed them  gently down my throat  and these tu lips might soon eclipse your brightest hopes...      urlLink African Links   Next i would suggest you get that  urlLink Common  "One day it'll all make  sense" if you havn't already...The track  "Restrospection"  hits home when i take a look at my daughter (born on May 14, 2004) Nijah     ...more pics in visuals.    I just discovered the  urlLink Hieroglyphics  i suggest you do the same...its so many positive artists out there that are unknown to me...that a simple search will finds one amazed at whats' being put on the table to be consumed by eager ears.

						    -escape without a trace to the place of infinite signs and space as time flies-watch the skies pay attention to what the sun do battle ignorant minds cuz they blind...redefine this art of war... all honors to   urlLink sun tzu      People who know me Would say that I am SHY- somewhat quiet person at times. So I don`t even have to say that i`m not attracted to loud women who talk to much or for that matter anyone who talks to much and never has anything to say of substance.  When I say that I`m a real LAID BACK type of person; that just means that it does not take much to keep me entertained and i rarely get stressed out. Everythang is everythang. I wonder if you can keep me entertained --mentally? Hope so.  As far as being STRONG WILLED, when i see something that I want and I have set my mind on obtaining it I will not give up until its mine. So that takes alot of self-confidence. Not bad for a shy person. So please believe me when i say that just because i am shy does not mean i am a push over; i never let people walk over me....That wouldn`t match my character at all...because i like to be in control of any and all situations i find myself involved.  DETERMINED (excerpt from a poem i wrote a few years ago) ...`Though your words stir in me restless winds/ I still remain emotionless and will not bend/ You can beat me but not brake me/ Look at me with scorn/ You can tear this flesh of mine/ But my mind is never torn...` I`ll let you interpret that one on your own.  As far as HUMOR I believe that you have to have a sense of humor because life has a way of doing things that you have no choice but to laugh at it or it might just drive you crazy. People who take the time to get to know me will find out i`m real easy to get along with. Even though im a serious person i make alot of jokes to keep the people around me smiling.  In my opinion i`m DEEP. Or better put self-conscious. If there is something about me that can be improved upon and you have that knowledge...By all means speak it..b/c I will listen. I`m a firm believer in change. Anything that continues to stand still is not making progress. You may think otherwise but I suppose the only way to find out is to try and get to know me. To find out why I hold certain opinions about life, love, religion and the human soul, poetry, and utimately the artistic poetry in loving life through God (or gods-whatever you believe; i do not judge) and your own soul. To me the meaning of life is coming to the realization that you are alive and that is profound in itself. LIVE LIFE.    -cemeteries are our only tended gardens we tendto die the moon is full. the tide is risen. the future is blossoming around us. yet, the fields of our destiny have been gardens untended. over-grown, and malnourished. we have come to cultivate this garden. we are the cultivators of a culture. (excerpt from Saul Williams linear notes.)
