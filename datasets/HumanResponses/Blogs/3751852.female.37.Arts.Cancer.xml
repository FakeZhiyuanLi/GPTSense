      sunday eve--played violin this morning in the church orchestra, sang in the choir, ate oreos and kentucky fried chicken and chocolate mousse cake and 5 cans of diet pepsi.  i   don't believe in junk food.    must get healthier soon.    i'm too old to keep this up.    last night c. played at kilby court with brainstamp, a version of brainstun, and again, we're too old for that scene, but i was hoping that maybe we're getting so old that we're cool to the 16 and 17 year olds who are into eighties stuff.  c. played viola with all his pedals hooked up, and i could see the young men get interested when he started using all the pedals and stuff.  guys dig all those gadgets, don't they? plus we're also getting so old that we've been doing stuff a long time and are getting better than everyone else.  plus the tunes that c. wrote were fabulous, and there's no denying that if you have any clue about music.  after dinner at bam's we took a drive to alpine.  it was so beautiful, dotted with miniature canyons and valleys.  no wonder all the rich people want to live there.  c. and i had an argument (nothing unusual for us) and the kids chewed us out.  they were right.  when we got home it was raining, and thundering and lightening, and there was a freaky bumping sound at the window.  it thought it was hail, but when i opened the blinds i found it was the new birdhouse, made from a gourd, that c. hung last night. eva and ingrid are packing for camp--i'm trying to track down suitcases, rain gear and sleeping bags.  lula is watching far too much tv since school got out.  i need to find an alternative.  cecily is getting five treatments a day for her exzcema, and 2 a day for her asthma.  she's saying a lot of words since she got tubes.  she's really high maintenance--fun, tho.

      eva and ingrid are at ballroom camp, lula at seven peaks with her dad, the baby is sleeping.  i was sleeping (a miracle) until the phone woke me.  the dryer is buzzing.  the ac is running--the sound is soothing today because i'm so on edge.  i want to be in a cool dark place.  i just ate 14 chocolate chips.  need to work on my novel while things are quiet.  don't know what to do when its this quiet.  it's heaven.

      Hyrum and Jill are here with Annabelle and their new baby Josie.  They are terrifically down to earth and nice, and not too high strung.  Tonight they're coming over for Hawaiian Haystacks, a sacrilicious Utah specialty--you brown and dice the chicken, add cans of cream of chicken soup, pour the whole thing on a stack of rice and then condiment with tomatoes, pineapple, cheese, green onions and crispy fried chinese noodles.  It may sound appalling, but trust me, its delicious, especially when you're in the throes of morning sickness and you only want the bland and salty foods of your childhood.    The allergist had nothing miraculous, so far, but he ordered a chest x-ray, a cbc, and some allergy tests, so lets see if he comes up with anything.  I sort of doubt it, and poor Cecily was traumatized by the procedures.  I tried.    Eva is practicing, with the incentive that as soon as she finishes learning her Debussy, she can take the month of August, or whatever is left of it after she learns the piece, off.  She seems to be focusing on the piece with a bit more vigor than usual.  She claims the piano ruins her life.  I claim that no one is ever sad that they can play the piano, and I also believe that, because she is so gifted at so many things, she gives up pretty easily when things get hard.  I want her to learn to push through.  Ingrid is on an organizing kick, and has been cleaning and organizing for two days.  She has become very on the ball and mature.  It's a little scary when your house gets so disorderly that the kids start cleaning voluntarily.  I feel bad, but then again I can scarcely care about anything the way I feel.  Lula is running through the sprinklers at Amy's house, and couldn't be happier.  She feels such pleasure at every little thing, and really loves and values people over things.  I want to be more like her.

      I have five minutes before I leave for the allergist with Cecily.  Perhaps he'll be magical and can fix her sad, sad ailments--the asthma and the ecxzema.    On July the 6th I discovered that I'm pregnant with my fifth child.  I have nothing more to say, but I have been so nauseated and emitic that I want to die, until Saturday when I went to Timpanogas ER and had an IV filled with lucious anti-nausea drugs, and then started on a very expensive regime of xopran, a drug used for chemo patients with nausea.  I am very grateful for drugs.    Lula sits next to me now, very, very close.  She is sinewy and blonder than Malibu barbie--a cross between Malibu Barbie and Olympic Gymnast Barbie.  I'm trying to explain to her why she needs to always tell me before she goes to a friend's house--we live in a neighborhood that somebody described as "Mayberry," and I have to agree.  The kids roam around, which has an upside and a downside.  Mostly up, but some parental control is lost.  I still think the old way was better, but I just wish I knew who has the guns and who the unsavory characters are.  More to say, but must go.

      i got it!  my beautiful yellow pills, oval.  zofran, the z.  i love pharmeceuticals.  hate that my freeking copay is ten bucks a pill, but what wouldn't i do to stop the nausea?  can't think of much.  i've actually had two pretty normal days in a row.  the nausea still lurks and rears up now and then, but its manageable.  i actually went to a dinner party yesterday, the grocery store, mall and a movie today, did laundry, vacuumed, took a shower. . . . i forgot how wonderful everyday life is.  o yeah, and i also made some job inquiries, went to therapy, wrote ad copy for Bonnie's shop and did dishes.  that's more than i've done in the last three weeks together.  i did not, however, get to watch any court tv today.  couldn't justify it with the ten dollar pills doing their work.  felt like i had to earn it by doing something productive.  i'm very, very tired now, tho, it's only ten seventeen pm.  this is the first day i haven't had a nap in weeks, and i don't sleep well.  i'm up every two hours to pee.  that usually stops in the second trimester, starts back up again in the third.  the girls and i looked at maternity clothes today at the gap, but i couldn't get excited.  i mean, finally they have some cute m. clothes but now i'm too old, fat, tired and burned out to care. plus the gap is creepy.  maybe i'll care when i feel better.  same with baby clothes.  can't even look.  i did get excited about a silly stuffed lamb with a wind-up music box inside at Nordstrom's for twenty-one bucks.  almost worth it--all the musical toys for babies are electronic now, and they sound terrible.  the wind-up was sucking me by way of nostalgia.

      Cecily is reading  Seventeen  (that's what happens when you're 18 mos. but have a 12 and a13 year old sister), Eva is practicing, still Debussy.  I'm sorry Eva.  I hope you'll thank me some day.  I'm probably over-zealous with you because you're my oldest. . . . Ingrid and Lula are at the pool with Grandma and some cousins--hurrah!  I'm feeling pretty good today, and am thinking about changing out of my nightie and into some clothes.  I've been fantasizing about a clean house with all new flooring.  Pregnancy brings out the bourgeois in me.  I also have a new essay in the works in my head for  hip mama .  I hope I can find the nausea-free space with in which to write it.

      I'm awake, just can't sleep a wink.  I'm pregnant AGAIN.  Yes, that was a scream.  It's kind of cool in a way, and kind of crazy-making in a way.  How could my life get any more out of control?   I was already sliding toward a breakdown, and then this happens, out of the blue, without my knowledge or approbation.  Do some bodies just want to get pregnant?  Must be.  Do some babies just want to be born?  I dunno.  That's the Mormon way of looking at it, and it's a very comforting thought, tho the cynic in me ( a big part of me) says come ON now with the Mormon folklore.  But what else makes more sense?  Not much.  Sorry to go nuts with the rhetorical questions.  In case you're wondering, being pregnant is no picnic.  Here's the rigamarole on pregnancy #FIVE:  1)  Very nauseated.  Midwives say to take vitamin B6, unisom, and frequent small high protein snacks. 2) That doesn't work.  Begin vomiting.  Can't eat anything.  Midwives call in prescription for phenegren to Seattle while I'm on vacation (vomiting and lying on the couch in Seattle instead of Utah. ) 3)  I want to die now. 4)  Stop taking phenegren pills because I can't keep them down.  Try phenegren suppositories.  5)Phenegren suppositories give diarrhea.  Stop taking. 6)  Can't eat or keep down any food for 24.  Go to ER for IV hydration and nausea drugs.  AAAAAHHHH. 7)  ER doc gives prescription for zofran.  Ten pills cost 100 bucks--that's my COPAY.  AAAAAHHH.  The day after the IV and the zofran is heaven. 8)  But the nausea comes back.  But not all the way, as long as I take the zofran religiously every eight hours. 9)  Two pills left.  My insurance hasn't approved more zofran.  It's early sunday morning. I need three pills to get to Monday.  I'm scared.  And who will pay for more pills, Christian asks. 10)  We can sell our house and move into a tent to pay for more pills.  I don't care.  I'll kill myself.  I'm a wimp.  I can't take it anymore.  I feel worn to a nub, and less strong and resiliant than ever before in my life.  Shouldn't I be all strong and tough after what I've been thru? 11) The zofran makes you constipated and hemerrhoidal.  Buy stool softener and witch hazel wipes.  Dignity is gone. 12)  They can send a man to the moon,  or send a man's penis skyrocketing anyway, but what about helping a girl out with her pregnancy.  Surely more women experience pregnancy than men experience erectile dysfunction.  And surely the relative magnitude of the two problems is not lost on anybody?  13) Do people know what it's like to feel like you have the flu for three, four, five, six, seven, eight or even nine months?  OK--I don't mean to be ungrateful.  I know a lot of woment would love to be pregnant and aren't/can't, etc.  I love my babies, that's for sure.  But I'm suffering big time right now, in my own private Idaho.
