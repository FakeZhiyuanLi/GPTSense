       urlLink    hmm.. i'm planning to sell her. i dun know why and gosh, i feel so guilty. what's wrong with me? in fact, i think that she's cute but somehow i feel that she's an outsider when placed together with my blythes. well, let's see how it goes... sorry about that, ivory.  urlLink

       urlLink    frikki is fast asleep, must be due to talking too much to sundae and showing her around.  rock a bye baby, rock-a-bye baby,   in the tree top. when the wind blows,   the cradle will rock.    urlLink

       urlLink    saw this little wooden cabinet at watsons yesterday, and i thought to myself that it'll be just nice to fit in my little miniatures that i bought during the  genting highlands trip. well, there are some empty space, does that mean i can still buy more.   urlLink

       urlLink    i am so happy that i saw this picnic basket at crazy clarks at redcliffe, brisbane. it'll be perfect to fit in my blythes. the basket came with some cups and saucers, but i threw them away as i dun need them. i filled the basket up with lots of goodies i bought at brisbane.    urlLink

       urlLink    it's the time of the day, they have to do their usual exercise in order to keep fit. alright, frikki, keep your nose and chin up and look straight, not at the camera. sundae, legs higher, legs higher. yes, that's the way. urlLink

       urlLink    frikki, i know that you're very excited to have sundae as your best pal, but i think you better stop tugging her head. what are you trying to do? what are you thinking?  urlLink

       urlLink    i realised that ivory has that high forehead too. hmm.. in fact, when placed together with my blythes, she looks a little alien. sorry about that, ivory. but i still love you. i will not abandon you, okay, hush hush. she's posing in frikki's clothes and wearing sundae's feathered hat. looks good, don't she?   urlLink

       urlLink    meet ivory in her original outfit. she's pretty, isn't she? because her body is fully articulated, she's pretty fragile when i hold her. unlike my blythes, they're firm and stiff.  urlLink

       urlLink    it's a pullip in the paperbag. i bought it at the same place, magma heritage at specialist centre. it's my first pullip. i saw a few pullip photos on the web, they look pretty. i kinda like the fully articulated body. that means that they can have more poses.    urlLink

       urlLink    isn't she lovely? she has blonde hair and bangs. she's the opposite of frikki, and that's why i bought her. she's gonna be a good companion for frikki. they'll be best friends.  urlLink

       urlLink    guess what's in the paper bag? it's my 2nd blythe doll. i bought it at magma heritage for $125. they're selling it cheaper there, and the place really has lots of dolls. it's totally unlike the miserable actioncity which has only a few to choose from.     urlLink

       urlLink    she looks like mickey mouse with this two buns. i dun really like the centre gaze, i wanted to change the eye chips but i dun know how to. i tried the glue stick, but it doesn't work. the centre gaze looks a little eerie, seem to be looking nowhere.  urlLink

       urlLink    how does she look with the new bangs? i hesitated for a while before i dare to go ahead with it. well, that's because i am afraid to ruin her hairstyle. but i guess it's because of her high forehead, that's why everyone says she looks freaky.   urlLink

       urlLink    here she is, with her captivating eyes and pink lips, she's posing in the feather i bought at artfriend a while ago. i bought the feather because i thought of making a card for a friend, but now i guess the feather is in frikki's possession. i dun think i can get it back.  urlLink

       urlLink    i named her tammy at first, but everyone at home kept saying that she looks freaky. freaky comes up in my mind whenever i wanna call her tammy. so in the end, i have decided to name her frikki. right now, she is posing in the top i made for her. the flowers beside is from ben and julie for my graduation.  urlLink
