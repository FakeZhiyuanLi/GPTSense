        Whooops      So Stephanie and I decided to go to the Valley after school today, but she had to drop off her car at her dads work first. So I am following her to his office and as she’s speeding down that street by the back of school doing like 45 I am thinking "Jesus, I am going to get a ticket trying to keep up with her, or get in an accident, oh Jesus I am going to die" but we don’t really read in to things like that because we all know I tend to be a little dramatic, right?  Anyway things are going great until we are sitting at some stoplight on capital. I absolutely have to have my cell phone right that instant for some reason I don’t remember and its some where in my backpack which is on the passenger side seat. SO I am digging around in my bag looking for it, but I see Steph's break light go off and her car start to go forward so I take my foot off the break and start to go and I continue looking for my cell phone. Then the next thing I knew my car is going in to Stephanie’s, “I am like ssshitt”, and I can see her laughing hysterically in her car.   SO we continue driving to her dad’s work, where we get out and inspect the damage (NONE, god loves me) but I still felt like a retard for rear-ending my friend. But I guess what happened was the lady in front of Steph had slammed on her breaks so Steph had to slam on hers and since I was not paying attention the only thing I slammed was the back of Steph’s car.  Ahh good times....    quote of the day:  "I like it cause its Fassst"  Music that fits my mood:  anything that's not 50 cent  Today i heart with all my heart:  anything that's not 50 cent

        It's a musical moment      Today was nice. Went to church. Went to some more grocery stores with my sister (i feel an addiction develpoing) and updated my music collection:  9 days- another day  Here's another day, she waits and pulls herself away At just the right moment to save her face I watch the time go ticking down, the waters falling on the ground I catch myself and try to speak with grace You needed just enough anger, to get you through the door And you got just enough honesty, to make you want a little more  I wish for nothing but the rain, to fall and wash away Everything that I've done wrong, find a way to make you strong If only for another day  When I'm all alone, just me and my ghosts Standing three deep, just like sentries at their post They make sure I remember, just a little more than most They make sure that I understand the consequence of past  When you see me chasing daydreams and you know that I'm not there, I'm not the one who sits across from you, who, returns your stare And I watch as you grow quiet like you always did And I wait to get what I deserve It's the part that doesn't die that makes it hurt...  Here's another day, she waits and pulls herself away At just the right moment to save her face I watch the time go ticking down, the waters falling on the ground I catch myself and try to speak with grace  I wish for nothing but the rain, to fall and wash away Everything that I've done wrong, find a way to make you strong If only for another day  If only for another day  Rooney songs that you have to hear: "ABC's of love," "popstars," "shakin," and "no, wait, but listen, i am talkin' to you"  Relient K songs good enough to risk the rath of the RIAA: "chapstick, chapped lips and things like chemistry," "college kids," and "pressing on"    quote of the day:  "Guess who slept with me last night!"   Music that fits my mood:  see entire above entry   Today i heart with all my heart:  tea from starbucks

        My chica, hillary duff and some janky store      Today was fun! *my sarcastic undertone is not detectable online*  Well well well. Finals are over. Thank god, lets just hoped i passed them all, horrary for not getting in to colleges, oh well, i have a little while longer until i start stressing over that.  Let's see what have i been upto lately? Absolutely nothing! ahhhhahahah! looking for a job, noteable places i have picked up applications, that christian book store (ahhahahahhah) Pac Sun, a really cool coffee shop on the W. side and a bookstore, will i get a job at any of these places? Probably not. But as long as i look like i am looking that will get my mom off my back.  Decided that i was going to a loser this evening. So i stayed home. Rented a bad movie with my sister and went on a hunt around tumwater for something. What was it we were looking for? Niether one of us knew, but our search took us to several grocery stores.  First we went to Mega Foods- most likely the most jankiest store i have ever been in in the greater olympia/tumwater/lacey area. My god, well while randomly wandering the isles, i decided i wanted some knew airfreshner for my car. So my sister and i start smelling the glade air bottle sprayers. And were having a blast until this old 40 year who works there comes up to us.(note: hes 40 and working at mega foods, probably my fate after schools see my sat scores) and starts ranting about us spraying them, "blah blah blah, vandelism...blah blah...smelling them not spraying them....against the law....next isle over....blah blah blah" i wasent really listening and i look over at my sister who i dont think has ever gotten yelled at by someone other than me before has this horrified look on her face (ahh must take her out with me more often, old men at grocery stores dont faze me anymore). After old man leaves we go on a search for bulk candy, which britt got me addicted to, its just so fun to get to put it in the bag yourself. All the while bring the aresol can with us and spraying it randomly. But as much fun as it was, there was no way i was bying anything from there. you know on acount of the janky-ness. So we leave and head across the street to Albertsons.  Ahhh, albertsons, still not as nice as my regular gorcery store (man i love you tumwater safeway, home of the coolest checkout people and best spot to see OHS students at 11 pm) but it will do. Nothing exciting happend here, except for this old man came up to my sister and i and goes "you two sisssters?" "yeah" "Yes, i saw you two, rasling (wrestling?) out side mega foods, and i thought, them two? they sisssters" LOL, i had to try so hard not to loose it i am telling you i might just venture in to that area more often just because wow, that was fun.   (note: my dad has broken my aim.) (ok so my dad had nothing to do with it, but his computer is stupid and it wont work *tear* but i am going through withdrawls, because i miss YOU! yes YOU, so call my new cell! Yay! new cell....)   quote of the day:    "its called vandalism"   Music that fits my mood:  anything by my girl: Hillary duff  Today i heart with all my heart:  MY SISTER

        The divine in me greets the divine in you     Ahh, two finals down, 4 to go…  Good times today:  Two hours of journalism at 8 in the morning was a bit much to handle and I really wished I had head phones to drown out the banter and bickering of everybody else, but once I got in to my own little world everything turned out fine.  You know the little world I am talking about. The one where it’s almost like nothing is going on around you or like it’s back round noise. Like when your sister is watching TV in the next room and you can hear it but cant understand it.   I end up there a lot. And get lots of comments about my spacey-ness. But really when I am in that state, so much is running through my head, it impossible to say I am spacing’ out. Maybe spacing out the mindless chatter from people around me…  There time has no concept, it’s like when you are in those half sleep moods. Where time seems to fly by and then slowly tick tock by, and the only way you’ll have any concept of what time it is is by looking at the clock.   I didn’t really do too much with my advantage of the half day: went to lunch with Steph and David. Had the girls over to work on the history final. (Never have I seen anyone so obsessed with George foreman grill as Andrea) Took a nap.  Went to the valley and ran. Maybe tomorrow I will do something fun. But that’s doubtful seeing as I have my hardest finals to study for.   Quick messages to people:  CONGRATS TO  DOROTHY  ON PASSING THE WRITTEN!!!!  To my fav. injured soccer player who just go her knee fixed...I miss you, and we need to go  Puma  shopping soon...   Well I taped the O.C. and want to go watch it now, so I leave you with these to think about:   quote of the day:  pleasure is the begining and the ending of living happily -epicurus   Music that fits my mood:  ummm, i dont really know what mood i am in so this good prove dificult, but i think i am going to have to go with  Another day by Nine days  or  taking back sunday-you know how i do  And one more  Aslyn- thats when i love you    Today i heart with all my heart:  Taking back sunday and American Hi-Fi

        HOW TO GET FROM O-TOWN TO SEA-TOWN and  HAVE A GOOD TIME IN UNDER 20 BUCKS      a. Fill up your tank, you only need about half of it, especially if when you get up there you make the "locals" drive you around (note: only if you are fully ok with the chance that you might die should you take part in said activity) b. Make your own pb and J sandwiches c. go watch your boys play basketball for $4 w/ your asb at UW, while gazing star struck at the school you are too dumb to get in to  d. Call your Seattle friends, and meet them for lunch, after you go shopping at university village  e. name his cars ex. Bubble f. follow them back to his house and chill, while in awe of the beauty Seattle holds g. have your friend pop in a horribly funny 80's movie called something about terror and dead and 2 h. make sure he adds comments at every opportune moment i. run errands with Seattle boys, its like an adventure, because apparently in big cities everybody forgets how to drive, or maybe that’s only teenage boys j. go to Bellevue, and hangout with more boys k. run more errands l. steal a car for a little joy ride around a group health parking lot m. watch some TiVo (sp?) of cowboy something or other n. talk over house intercoms (i thought those were only in the movies) o. back to Seattle for dinner with boys parents p. head home q. stop in *gasp* Tacoma for some ice cream    quote(s) of the day:  "We're going to go have a little talk" and "Yeah, that night, and the next, and the next..."

        NEW LAYOUT OOOOO     YAY! I was so bored today i decided it was time for an upgrade. Pretty huh? This whole HTML code stuff is so cool. I wish i knew more of it, it would be so fun to make your own like real website. Hummm....maybe instead of becoming a doctor i will become a webdesigner. Ehhh....doctor seems a little safer. Who knowes how long the internet as we know it now will be along for.  Well i am going to head to bed soon, going cell phone shopping with the mom tomorrow. Hopefully i will return home with a new one! Ahh which reminds me, if i am not returning your calls its because i dont have your number so sorry.   quote of the day:  Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command.

        "The only half gallon i know is of icecream"    --random boy i met  Let's start with an   update   to my chaotic life:  Got a kitty: Ginger, I highly suggest you stop by and see her, if you haven't already  made it through a full week of school, I went to almost every class, yay!!  most likely failed a history test on Thursday and a math test on Friday,   started to wonder how the hell I am ever going to get in to college  rebelled against my mother over a midnight run to safeway with britt and didn't get in trouble, along with that learned that you cant sneak out of my house  broke my cell phone, and realized I am going to have to pay 150- 300 dollars to get one, (note: Jessica has NO money)  ********************    specifically today....    Went and saw chasing Liberty with Ellen in Yelm. Always fun. It was actually a really good movie. I have this weird fixation with Mandy Moore. Yeah, I know its very sad and disturbing, but she rocks!  After the movie I rode around with Brittany in her truck. All seems innocent and fun enough right? Until you through in these two components, its stick and she doesn't know how to drive it. AHAHAHAHAHHA. I don't believe I have ever said the phrase "TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS, WHEN YOU SHIFT" before in my life, but today I said it like 80 times. (I love you Brittany)     COMMING SOON (MONDAY)   ROAD TRIP!!! Well road trip might not be the correct term for a drive to Seattle. But god damn, road trips rock and so will this little adventure. Shall we evaluate the "funness" of this trip:  Jessica and Brittany +10 fun points Car +5 fun points No parents +5 fun points Seattle +30 fun points Basketball +2 fun points Basketball boys +10 fun points UW +5 fun points College boys +15 fun points O'dea boys +15 fun points TOTAL: 97 fun points  and i leave you with a nice quote from Brandon "Forget all the petty shit"

        Feelin' the devine spirit of the Lord     Whoo-hooo, just got back from  confirmation meeting , a glorious way to spend your night when you dont really have to go to school tomorrow. Ehh oh well, it kept me out of trouble. It was as usual, me and Jenna sitting there updating each other on our dramatic lives while the rest talk about God and whatnot...  Anyone starting to feel the  pressure of finals coming . Ahh, why must they insist on making our lives living hell? I swear to God some teacher (cough cough Mr. Kabat cough) get this cheap pathetic thrill out of watching us squirm. Well this year I will do good on them and maybe actually study for them... But so far its lookin' like its going to be an easy three days. Let’s analyze them:  English w/ McDougall: due to the fact he now has a new pair of twins to care for, there is no final. (YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) US Hist. w/ Kabat: Mock trial (ehhh, hes still a bastard) Spanish w/ McNamera: No word on the final (makes me nervous) Algebra 2 w/ Grosey: test (ehh, whatever, ill get a B on it just like his finals last year) Journalism w/ Ensberg: NO FINAL due to the fact that how do you test someone on writing an article for the paper? (YAY!!!!!! Party!!!!) Micro Bio w/ Bassett: he says there will be a test but i doubt that...(hate you Mr. Bassett)

        CHEATING     8 letters that can completely ruin relationships, marriages, and friendships  I am so confused as to what classifies as cheating. Its up to the discretion of the one “cheated” upon. But what happens if you don’t know? What if its the beginning of a relationship before you make it official? What if you broke up and were going to try to make things work again? What if you were on a break? What if you were drunk?  Is having feelings towards someone else cheating or is it just acting on those feelings?  Do you have to tell the person?  I wish there was a Dating Rule Book that told you what was right and was wrong. And if it was wrong what the punishment should be. But I imagine if that book existed it would become like any other set of rules. People would find loopholes and would adapt the rules to make it easier for them, like Free Parking in Monopoly.  I guess what you have to do is weigh the situation: are the feelings in the relationship strong enough to over come the unfaithful actions?  But that takes us right back to the beginning. What if you just dont know?

        SCHOOOOOOOL     SO i did venture out in my car last night and once i got out of my neighborhood the streets were fine and the whole evening was uneventful as far as driving went. But i did step in a snow puddle, humm pretty much felt like a dumbass.  Back to school today,(at least it was late start) and i think dorothy and i share the same view point on school: OranGestar22: bah i hate school with a burning passion. whats bigger than passion. because i hate it more than a passion and would like to express my REAL hate for it. and you think it would be cool that we missed 3 days and all. But NO, finals are like next week and teachers are cramming all the shit we missed in to this week!  Dude check out the fog.   Question:  if someone calls you and doesnt leave a message, but you see thier name on the caller id, do you call them back?

        To drive or not to drive?     Slowly but surely the street are starting to apear from underneath the 8 inches of compact snow and ice. I wonder if my little car could brave the streets yet. But then again since the snow is still higher than my car i doubt it.   Nothing has really happened since last night beside from the fact that i have learned that i am not the only one going crazy from being stuck inside the same half mile radius.   I bet we have school tomorrow, which i am having mixed emotions about. Mostly i dont want to go back becaue i still havent written that stupid english essay. i keep hoping that magicaly i will open the word doucument on my computer and it will be written. But everyday with out fail there it is, with only one paragraph written and a shitty one at that. But school, just like the snow, does have its perks: (i havent thought of any yet i am sure there are some)

        SNOW SNOW SNOW     it's so pretty to look out the window and see the snow falling, but still its starting to get annoying. Okay, not starting IS annoying. I dont think i have been warm since December and the pavement hasn't been seen since pre-new years eve. And i am  I am feeling starting to wonder when its going to be done.    But it does have its perks including, but not limited to:  No school swings in the snow LBA sledding snow ball fights wrestling in the snow everything looks perfect scarves, gloves and mittens swings in the snow snugling up with blankets   thought of the moment:  it's not cool to just take off and say you will be back in a couple days when its snowing...not cool, not cool....   Song to download:  You know how i do- urlLink Taking Back Sunday  "So sick, so sick of being tired.  And oh so tired of being sick.  Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about.  So obviously desperate, so desperatly obvious.  So good at setting bad examples.  Listen, TRICK, I've had all I can handle.

        WARMING UP TO WINTER     Well its winter.... and I think this year someone is trying to make up for the lack of snow from last year.... I have been "trapped" in this house for over 24 hours and I am starting to drive myself crazy. Its the worse kind of "trapped" too, the kind where you know you can leave.... but you really don’t have anything better to be doing. Or at least nothing that’s good enough to risk your life driving in the snow for.  I have spent the last couple days doing nothing.... Downloading music Cleaning my room Avoiding my essay  Avoiding phone calls And putting around on the Internet   With school starting tomorrow (only kidding just learned its canceled due to the snow) I am going to regret that my last weekend was spent eating popcorn and watching "when Harry met sally"   But actually a lot of fun (read: interesting) times were had this break:   trip to Bellingham  to visit my cousin:  where I a. went shopping crazy b. locked myself out of her apartment while she was at work, right off the Western campus were there is a murder/rapist on the loose c. watched the silence of the lambs and didn’t scare myself d. almost killed her fish  And after I returned or was it before Bellingham anyway sometime in December, there was  caring for drunken friends :      Those friends who shall remain nameless to protect their "innocence" got completely shit faced and were throwing up all over themselves, another reason to add to why I don’t drink.... especially not straight shots of cheap vodka...way to go guys...  Then there was Christmas,  multiple Christmas’s:       a. Christmas at my uncles b. Christmas eve with my moms parents c. Christmas day with my mom d. Christmas day with my dad and his wife e. Christmas day with my dads family. Thank god, most of the time I can sit there and sulk and no one talks to me....  Who hoo this is probably my favorite post Christmas activity from this break, the day that well now infamously forever be referred to as  "the night when Erin set me up on a blind surprise double date" :      Now I am sure you’re wondering how that all came to be, yeah let me tell you. So, innocently I am sitting on the couch watching "how to deal" with my sister when my phone rings. Its Erin she wants me to come along with her and Andrew and his friend, now I know what you’re think the singular friend had to of tip me off, but Erin is so tricky like that I didn’t even catch that. I said no. There was no way I was going to go sit through some stupid movie with her and Andrew, because the size of his head was so small it makes me nervous.      Some how it was agreed that I was going to go though. So one hour latter there I was climbing in to the backseat of Andrew's red pickup and introduced to Kyle. "Hummm" So we start our drive to Yelm. Me and Kyle in the back with Erin and Andrew in the front. Andrew of course has his "pimpin'" music system blasting and of course the speakers our underneath our seats, creating a quite comfortable vibrating on my ass.... Which of course being the mature young gentlemen they are the boys make several cracks about. So finally we get to Yelm, and of course the movie is sold out. But no worries we can still drive back to Lacey and make the late showing there.      So back in the baby truck we go butts vibrating, bad music blasting all the 25 minutes back. Of course its allot more fun this time because Andrew has taken to making cracks like its one of those dating shows on WB that they only show REALLLY late at night...hahahahaha so (NOT) funny. Finally Kyle decides to talk to me, taking a break from making fun of people who play team sports (apparently wrestling is the best sport ever, I forget to mention that my nickname for wrestling is boy sex and that I play soccer) and ask how old I am, and when I reply with seventeen an "ohhhh shit Erin I am going to kill you" escapes his lips.... did he really think anything was going to happened between us where age was going to be a problem.... (Side note, latter I learned Kyle is at the ripe age of 22 and attending WSU)    I meet a  boy  and get bored in 5 days flat:      We will just call him Jared, because well that would be mean to post his name on the internet...how I met him a friend of a friend and we will leave it at that. I was told before I met him that I would think he was good looking but that he was an ass and that he would probably try to hit on me. Well he was cute but he sure as hell wasn’t an ass, he was quite funny actually, and so we decided to let Jared hang out with us for the evening.      Then the next 4 days were all Jared all the time until new years. And I guess that saying about too much too fast is bad, or maybe that’s just my mom saying that when I eat too much bread. But anyway for some reason I got bored, and decided that I was done so on the first when he called me like 12 times and I never answered. I figured that was a fine way to end it, but others had different ideas; apparently the polite thing to do is to tell them. But I just kept on ignoring the calls and eventually he left a mean message that was not necessary at all. The end. Hey it was fun for a while   Dying in the snow storm:       So one very cold day Brittany I decided to go to Yoga at the Valley like we usually do on Tuesdays. But it was a bad class and there was this yoga bitch in front of us. You know the really flexible girl that starts doing the poses before the instructor finished explaining them. Everybody knows out of yoga courtesy you wait for all instructs to be given before you start moving in to proud warrior. So we left and outside as we climbed in to my car the snow was just starting to stick thinking nothing of it we call my cousin Erin to have her meet us on the Westside for coffee. So Britt grabs my phone, and looks up "Erin" I can hear her next to me being all "Erin its me Brittany...Brittany with the curly hair...Jessie’s friend..."*she turns to me* "she doesn’t remember me" *confused look* "ohhhh she just hung up"  *calls Erin back* "THIS IS BRITTANY.... YOU DO SO KNOW A BRITTANY" *hands the phone to me* and I start talking to Erin who turns out to be my neighbor Erin across the street, not my cousin across town. We finally got a hold of the right Erin our stomachs aching from laughing so hard. No one else seemed to find it as amusing as we did.      So we had our coffee watching the snow come down and chatting about all the boys who have screwed us over this week. And about 2 hours latter we decide to head home on account of the snow coming down so hard. When we get to the parking lot there’s a good 3 inches down. After much deliberation the best way to get home has been decided upon, so we start trekking through town. The amount of cars on the road at 3 should have tipped us off that the roads were REALLY BAD. But we kept on driving, and when we were heading down the 4th ave hill the car starts spinning off the road in to the curb, I start screaming while Britt keeps talking away to her parents reassuring them that we would get home just fine. AHAHHAHAHAHA, so after that we said a little (read: really really long) player to the almighty god that he might spare us on this drive home and he did...45 minutes later we were home having only slid off the road one more time.

        Strongly in need of some therapy      Crazy last 2 days. My sister has mono, again, which means i might have mono. Getting tested Monday. Spent all day friday and saturday sleeping emerging only to answer my phone and only if they caller was somebody worth it.  Went to Alpine "express" today with Maddy. She needed goggles i needed to get out of the house. Yay, for the boys that work there, i tried on just about every pair of goggles in the store. Then i went home and took a nap.  then around 10 ish i went to Rib Eye with Britt. Let me describe Rib Eye for those of you not in my local area or the losers that are just not familiar with this establishment. Its located across from Cascade Driving School, where many good times were had, if i do say so myself. Itsfregunanted by the highest class of truckers and lesbian couples in their Ford 250's. I would say Britt and i fit in just perfectly.... But it was actualy really fun, or for me at least i was in a mood, where everything was hysterical.   Comming down so i am going to go watch SNL like the loser i am, but i leave you with the crasiest eating disorder ever:   Pica:   An uncommon urge to eat non-food items such as laundry starch, dirt, baking powder or frost from the freezer.   Going to go get that Rubber Cement now...   quote of the day:  "did you see the lesbian couple" "thats why i had to focus on the blind children going to camp"  Music that fits my mood:  You steal my sunshine  Today i heart with all my heart:  rubber cement

        Hope is a waking dream      So stressed...  Wednesday, I went and talked to my counselor about my schedule next year. And came to the conclusion that I HAVE TO TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL!!!!!  Hahahaha, way to go. I am so pissed. I need one full Art credit and one full PE credit and I already have my 6 OTHER classes I want/need to take. AHHAHAHAH, and the chances that I get  PE home schooled are very slim at best I might get a semester. But that still leaves me with a credit and a half to fit in somewhere. That somewhere being this summer. GOD DAMN.  I guess this what I get for putting things off until the last year. There's always running start, but I really don't want to take any more classes my senior year, so it looks like I will be dragging myself to that Hell Hole in JULY...  HAVE I MENTIONED THAT I HATE ART!!!!!! Yeah, well not hate, but suck horribly at anything involving creativity.  So if any of you are in the same boat as me and are enrolling in art or PE this summer call me at least we can be depressed about missing our summer together....  (on the bright side at least I don't have to take a real class like Math or History, something that requires brain cells. YAY for needing mindless classes to get to college)   quote of the day: Up your Ziggy with a WaWa brush  Music that fits my mood: Fall Out Boy  Today I heart with all my heart:  All I Wanna Do

        In Journalism     Yep. I am in journalism right now and i am bored out of my mind, we were suppose to be working on layout but Brennan is doing our page, thank god, and that leaves me with time to spew my thoughts on to this blank pages.  Went to the Valley and ran into Megan, then we went to Britt's then back to the Valley. That was fun. My back is really sore today but only on the right side. I dont know why either I didnt do any back machines, so hummm....  School is going slow, and 6th period i am sure will just drag on forever just because i cant wait to get home. YAY for no homework tonight!!    I really want some Taco Bell like a nice chiken burrito, yumm, maybe i'll go after school then go visit Britt at work, then TARGET, need to get a new hair straightner, mine only heats up on one side. Well people need to use this computer (its hooked up to the scanner) so i shall talk to you all latter!!  BYE!!   quote of the day: "Jessie keep your body covered"  Music that fits my mood: Taking Back Sunday  Today i heart with all my heart: White board markers

        GOOD ADVICE THAT YOU JUST CAN TAKE     Wow, it’s been a few days since I have updated, so here is a little outline on what to expect this entry:  Quotes and lyrics Today’s drama (only kidding next time) Weekend update     QUOTES AND LYRICS    I have this little notebook where I write down all my favorite quotes and sayings and here are few of my favorite  favorite  ones right now. And some song lyrics that seem to apply to everything that’s going on right now.  Pleasure is the beginning and ending of living happily.  Epicurus   I'm a bitch, I'm a tease  I'm a goddess on my knees  When you're hurt, when you suffer  I'm your angel undercover  I've been numb, I'm revived  Can't say I'm not alive  You know I wouldn't want it any other way  Meredith Brooks   Young people are in a condition like permanent intoxication because youth is sweet and they are growing.  Aristotle   You can tell a lot about a fellow’s character by the way he eats his jellybeans.  Ronald Regan   Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.  Epicurus   Think of all the fun you’ve had. The finest lines divides a night well spent from a waste of time.  Taking Back Sunday   All human actions have one or more of the seven causes: Chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reason, passion, and desire.  Aristotle   A person revels his character by nothing so clearly as the joke he resents.  George Christoph Lichtenberg   Half of American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for president, one can only hope it’s the same half.  George Vidal   “its not a bad idea to get in the habit of writing down one’s thoughts. It saves one having to bother anyone else with them.  Isabel Colegate      WEEKEND UPDATE:    We will start with Friday, but bare with me, I am starting to forget a lot of what happened.  Friday I went out to lunch with my mom then drove to the W. Side to do some shopping and ran in to Dorothy. So we shopped around and I got a few new things that I really didn’t need. But isn’t that how clothes shopping usually goes.  Latter on my sister and I went and visited Britt at work, since it was on the way home, were Britt talked me into going to a deaf meeting. (for school) Well yes so we went to that for like 20 minutes left and drove back to her house. We kind of just sat around for a few hours giggling with her Mom about how insane some people where.   Then we went to Red Robin with Megan and her friend Danielle. Umm I don’t think there are words to describe those two. WOW. That’s all I got. After a while Britt and I left and went to rent movies, sex in the city marathon and Secretary (oh my god, most fucked up movie ever, I recommend it if you are one of those people who gets turned on by S&M shit, but uhh no, it kind of scared me)  We woke up the next morning and head off to the wrestling match in TACOMA. Ahhh we all know my strong love for Tacoma, oh wait that’s right…No. So as were pulling in to the parking lot we notice everyone leaving. Umm okay?! We call one of the Oly wrestling boys to figure out whats going on, great they are on break till 3 its one. What the hell are we suppose to do till then?  We go in and wonder around aimlessly amidst all the HOT boys. We try to find small head, but he is nowhere…. always too bad. He like everybody else we know is gone out to eat. Sad so we look at all the postings and realize all the Oly boys are OUT!!! So we were like okay how about Capital, no they are out too. Okay North Thurston, out, Black Hills out, Odea, out. Great now no one we might even remotely recognize will not be here, except small head he was coming back for sure. But he is not worth sticking around for 2 hours for just so I can make fun of him trying to hook up with high schoolers. So we decided to leave  We drove around aimlessly like we usually do, and head towards kirspy kreme, where we met some more randomness (See Britt’s journal) and then got some gas in Lakewood (ahhhh) and went home. The end….   Then I hung out with my sister. She gets a little angry when we don’t hangout on the weekends so we went shopping where we ran in to Britt and her Cousin at Old Navy, again I bought things that I didn’t need.  Well this getting long, its getting late, and I am getting tired… so I am going to stop. Hope everyone is having fun back at school! I know I am!  Ooo yay! I “stole” a scanner from my dad, so I now have one on my computer, I just need to hook it up then PICTURES!!!!!!!    quote of the day:  umm see above  Music that fits my mood: "Ima bitch" meredith brooks  Today i heart with all my heart:  blue ball point pens

        MEOW     I had fun this weekend, watching boy sex, running into friends at Old Navy (twice), spending way too much money and rocking out in cars.  Thanks to all those who made my weekend a blast (namely: Britt, my Sister and rondom boys on I-5)      What Irrational Number Are You?     You are &radic;2

        i like the way you move      I was watching  Here on Earth  the other day. For those of you who haven’t seen it it goes like this, Girl likes Boy, Boy is not Girls type, but they fall in love, Girl forgets to tell Boy she has cancer. Girl dies, Boy cries.   Anyway the Girl, Samantha, had an interesting perspective on what heaven is. She believed that heaven was a place where you went when you died and it was full of everything you loved from your life. I am not sure how this would work with people that are still living, but it’s a nice theory.    Below heres is what I would want to be included in my version of heaven:     My room, including my green blanket and comfy bed    My family, friends, and ginger    All of Audrey Hepburn’s movies    Carmel Apple suckers    Pink tinted glasses that I always could wear so everything was in shades of red and pink    All my cds    A hot tub    A computer     Tall glasses of ice water    A sandy beach with warm clean water    Bubble tea and smoothies     And books lots of books ********************************************* found this cool site and just had to do it, sadly it just made me realise how few places i have been. But spring break i am going to Hawaii YAY!!!!     urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide    quote of the day: "I've never seen one before this, but i am pretty sure that was not a normal size for one."

        I was like nemo, and i just wanted to go home!      Today was fun....  Got up at ten, early for a break, and Maddy came over. We watched 13 she did laundry (her washer/dryer is broken) then we went to Britt’s. To retrieve all our clothing that has accumulated over there from random sleepovers and borrowings. There Megan was cleaning out her car and Maddy and I got inspired so we went back to my house and cleaned out ours!  After that was all done we went to taco time, and then to target. Target for the second day in a row together. But as we were sitting in Maddy's perfectly clean car, an accident happened, she spilled a container of hot sauce all over every where including her purse. It’s a good thing both of us were in a killer good mood so we just laughed it off...  Then after getting trapped at the bank by a psycho we went back to my house for a little bit, and then Maddy had to leave to work. (Tear) Leaving me scrolling through my phone book trying to find a friend I didn’t make it to the C's before I just gave up and put 13 in again.  After a little bit of more middle school drama my mom came home, I escaped to my room, and seeing as I am the only person in the house w/o their own DVD I had to put a new movie in. But I gave that up and just read a trashy book,  Gossip Girl . You know what I am talking about. They are the stupidest, most annoyingly poorest written I have probably every read but I am addicted and have re read 2 and am now on the third. And i have only had them for 3 days.  After that and a nap it was time for a trip to Baskin and Robbins with my sister. Luckily rapist doesn’t work there anymore. His sickening smiles make me want to scream " I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"  Here comes one of the best parts of my day OC!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Seth its official I need a boy like that. I hate Anna and I hate Marisa. That is all about my sickening obsession.  Well talked to Karen, we are going to the PUMA store soon. On a sad note to all my soccer girls there is major South Sound drama, with coaching, and I will not play for Mike, as I know neither will most of you. Wont go in to details here as to bore others but ask me or Karen (preferably the latter) for the low down.  Well people are getting ancy and I have better things to do (no not really, but I think I am going to get carpal tunnel soon) so I leave you, I had fun tonight talking to everyone online. It’s always reassuring to talk to old friends. And I can’t wait for my 9 AM wake up call tomorrow!   quote of the day: Falcon585Voy: sepcially if you take "Human Sexuality" psych 210 (its official i am going to UW)  Music that fits my mood:  music from the oc  Today i heart with all my heart:  AIM talks with all my favorite buddies

        Yesterday     Valentines day....always fun....  For the better part of the day i just layed around and watch movies and read and slept. And didnt feel like i was wasting my weekend because i wasent hangingout out with friends because i have all next week to do that.   Around 9 David and Britt stopped by with a rose (yay!!) and i left with them to go back to britts, got to ride in Davids brand new car. (so cute) David left and britt and i decided to go to McCrackens to see what was going on there. Ehh nothing so we drove to lacey to get some food and drove around some more and pretty soon we just went back to britts.  There we did nothing. You would thing two 17 year olds would take advantage of an empty house but we didnt, we watched Glitter on VH1. But pretty soon Britt went upstairs because Myles called...(stupid boy) I heard angry voices comming from upstairs so i went and checked it out and of course they were aruging over something stupid....Blah blah blah  then after myles, we went to sleep...all in all it wasent that bad of a day...   quote of the day:  "dont tell brittany...."

        Kiss it all good bye      somebody named augie keeps text messaging me with a 559 area code...WTF  Its Brittany's birthday today and I waiting to go to breakfast with her maybe today...  Friday I went to Sprinkers with Ellen to watch Caroline in her ice skating show. That was really fun. I had never seen live ice skating before, it was really dramatic with lights and rain and snow and music...And some of the boys were hot, but I was informed that they were pretty much all gay, always too bad.  Saturday morning I went to help at the wrestling meet at Oly with Steph. There was a moment or two of confusion we almost had to be the people who keep time and score and when it goes to 5 seconds left you have to go out on the mat and then hit the ref with a towel when its over. There was no way in hell I was going to do that, so luckily we got to work at the concession stand. Which was quite fun because we got to see all the wrestler with no shirts on...   quote of the day: "only the mediocre are always at their best"-- Jean Giraudoux  Music that fits my mood:   a New Found Glory- boy crazy  Today I heart with all my heart: the color green

        WIth those abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes      Today proved interesting…  SO it all started today at lunch when Jenna mentioned her latest boy toy, whose name I have forgotten was working at Safeway. So it was decided that Britt and I would go to Safeway today after school. This was met with much animosity from Jenna, which just made Britt and I want to go more. So we did. (Soon I am going to learn how to start my sentences without so, but for now…) So we drove to the Safeway on Yelm highway, no boy toy, Safeway by that round a bout, no boy toy Safeway by North Thurston, no boy toy. Well that was all the Safeway’s that he could have worked at so we were quite disappointed, so, we got some Starbucks and Taco Bell and went home. But yeah all in all, it was quite a good adventure driving around checking out all the Safeways…. But don’t worry anyone we are going to stalk him one time while he is actually working, we will figure it all out.  SO. Britt’s birthday is Sunday. Ahhhhhhhh. And I need to get her a present…At least I have money now thanks to the new allowance deal with my mom. YAY, FOR LOTS OF MONEY!!! YAY!!!!  Ahahahahahaha Dorothy parked next to me this morning  Went to the basketball game with Steph…It was fun….Mt. Tahoma….ahahhaa. Furthered my hate for Tacoma. Apparently girls in Tacoma don’t a. know how to wear sports bras b. know how to cheer and not sound like men c. know how to not pull their shorts up their asses. But all this aside they kicked our Asses. But I guess I already knew white girls couldn’t jump.  Jessica's goal for the semester? 4.0 ...theres only a four  things  standing in my way... mcDougall, mcNamera, Bassett and Grosey but dont you worry i  will  do it  Looking for a new faceplate for the new cell…. GorJessGirl4: lol, i need your help i am shopping for a new faceplate for my phone GorJessGirl4: and i am torn i dont know which pink one to get OranGestar22: haha ok, oh my, what has this world come to It proved difficult and I never did settle down on one…   quote of the day:  "Jess, dont you see up the boy basketball players shorts when they are sitting on the bench. I always thought it was weird how they sit like this *demonstartes them holding their croth areas* but now i get it" Steph    Music that fits my mood:  Kenny Chesney there goes my life   Today i heart with all my heart:  My ginger kitty, shes sitting on my lap right now....YAY

        Greeners, uno, and drunken stupors      I have decided to combine the last 2 days into one journal entry....So here are the highlights from Friday and Saturday:   Friday:   Went to school, YEAH for JSA convention at Oly coming up its going to be so awesome, cant wait. Ummm got an A on my micro bio final...who would have thought?   Hung out with Becca after school at her friend Ryan’s house. Then Becca and I went out to dinner and over analyzed everyone around us...always fun. Went to my house then to becca's then picked Ryan and his friend up, whose name I have forgotten.   We then followed their other friends in search of some party. Anyway we ended up driving all over Olympia. But our final destination was Evergreen. HAHAHA, first I am not a big fan of big parties and at evergreen? You have to be shitting me, so Becca and I started to leave. This resulted in some kid named Mario throwing himself behind my car (he’s already wasted) saying he wanted us to stay because we were girls and we had friends. I informed him all my friends were fat AND ugly (take no offense I just wanted to get home) he stated "fat bitches" love him too. Yes ok whatever.... I get back in my car and he says he will sue me if I hit him and I tell him my dad is a lawyer and that probably wouldn’t be a good idea.... he moves...we leave and get lost in the vast and dark roads, scary...but we some how made it back to my house.   Saturday:  Had to report back to school at 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ahh the joys of journalism. I am standing at the back of the school about to walk in when my cell phone rings. It’s Brennan, my fellow journalist. Who tells me she too is at school, but there is no way in!!! Oh no!! We walk in to the commons which has been taken over by a bunch of Bus Drivers (no joke there was a bus driver convention) but all the doors to the halls are locked. So we go to the outside of hall one and start peering through the windows. And what do you know we find Snodgrass in his room, so he comes and opens the hall door for us. YAY!!!   But after working on my page for like 45 minutes Brennan decides she needs food so we head to Safeway, where we run into several people we know, what is it about Safeway? So we go to buy her food, and she has forgotten her wallet!! Hahahahaha, so we drive back to Oly and I drop her off at her car and I head home because I have had enough of being at school.  Its then that I speak with my cousin and get to hear of the drama her collegiate life holds. Her plans for the night included playing uno with some friends...I can only hope my college life is half as interesting as hers.   But my phone is ringing so I am going to go.... Happy super bowl Sunday to everyone   quote of the day:  "ok...skank"  Music that fits my mood:  care bears theme song  Today i heart with all my heart:  Black and white audrey hepurn movies

         No one listens when no one talks      Its funny that you can be having such a blast of a night and one stupid boy can ruin it, or ruin it for your friend thus ruining it for you.  Went to HAPPY HAPPY BRITHDAY with my Britt yesterday, shared some ice cream, yummm, had a really fun waiter, I don’t remember what we did afterwards, but I am sure it was fun.  Then all hell broke lose and I official want to chop off his umm privates, but whatever, it doesn’t have anything to do with me so that might be a bit rash.   TODAY was late start I got coffee pre-school and Megan brought Steph and I doughnuts first period.... second was the same and third we worked on our piñatas always entertaing, fourth was fine and for once I didn’t watch the clock, found Maddy after 4th (her and Britt have math too but next door) to start our usual walk to lunch but just as I expect miss Brittany was MIA.   So without a second thought or a bye to our lunch table we headed over to Britt’s. Which was fine for Maddy her not having a 5th or 6th period class, but yeah I figured Saturday work was worth the risk for a friend.  Got to Britt’s had to practically break in....went and got slurpees at 7-11, almost died and then they dropped me back at school just in time for the end of 5th...whoops.... Yeah not that it mattered.  Scary though, Mr. Grant called me to his office 6th and I had forgotten that I had made an appointment with him during 2nd, and of course Mr. Bassett being the ass he is announces to the class that I have been summoned to the principals office, yeah fuck off.  Anyway run in to Stephanie (Golson) and Dorothy in the halls, talked to them for a few minutes and returned to 6th with 5 minutes left.  After school I took Dorky home and headed back over to Britt's where Maddy still was. I decided since it was such a nice day we should wash our cars. BUT ms mopey didn’t agree, but we got her convinced and we headed to my house to wash 'um.  Which of course ended in us being soaked, our cars with dirt spots and some poor serious mentally damaged for life elementary schoolers who happened to walk by.  We all went our separate ways at this point, Britt to shower, Maddy to work, and me? I probably got online. Britt called later and we went to Oly to watch some Baseball and soccer.  Yeah because we stayed for so long .  We got bored and went to Safeway and then to Matt's then to Nelson's or was it the other way around, visited Maddy at work and kind of drove around aimlessly and ended up at that lookout park in Tumwater (I think Britt wanted to make out or something, because there’s only one reason people go there, but yeah, NO)  Came home around 8ish and Maddy came over and watched OC with me, and now I am doing this!   Moral of the story:  all you need are your best friends    quote of the day: "Shouldnt you be at school or something" "YEAH, its only lunch and journalism and your so worth Saturday Work"  Music that fits my mood: Burn-Usher  Today i heart with all my heart:  slurpees, silly fights with bestfriends, sunroofs, OC, AND boys that i cant have  PS: i heart Janet too, and this made me happy: holeinfoot9721: man...the OC seriously reminds me of summer...which then reminds me of paradise hotel.. Gorjessgirl4: ME TOO holeinfoot9721: the "good ol' days"

         I actually do like Jessica Simpson       Today was soooooooooooooooo fun, after school I went to Tacoma with Morgan, hit up the Tacoma mall and then we went to the valley for a while, went for a walk through tumwater and reminisced about our weekends  "Isnt it funny how all our stories start 'so I was at this party on Friday..."  We had fun, getting honked at by random cars and stalking truck driving boys on I-5  got some homework to do, math and reading for English and planning next years schedule, so far it appears its going to be: AP English, journalism, chemistry, pre calc, some art class and some social studies class possibly AP psych depending on I don't know, but as my counsler and Dorothy remind me today I kind of like my social life   quote of the day: "...Jovial..." "oooo good vocab word" "I know I don't get 20 out of 20 for nothing" "aren't they out of 25?" "yeah...I only have a b in math..."  Music that fits my mood:  kube 93 traffic jam  Today I heart with all my heart:  THIS WEATHER. DUH!

         Fire House parties, bowling and tumwater safeway, what more can a girl ask for?       We'll start with Friday and you compare it to what I said I was going to do:  Around 5 ish I met Kristen and Megan at the mall to get a present for Ellen, whose party we were going to later. After allot of indecisiveness we finally settled on something and headed over to the party. It was really fun so I stayed for a while, but then remembered that I promised my sister I would hangout with her that night so I headed home.  I didn’t even make it out of Ellen’s neighborhood before the phone calls started, Maddy Steph, multiple big birthday parties. Ok so I went over to Steph's and guess who was there? Ms Dorothy, so we (meaning Dorothy) drove my car back to my house and headed over to Tumwater Safeway to meet Maddy.  After a little bit of confusion it was decided Maddy would drive and we were to meet Ryan at some gas station out in Boston Harbor then follow him to the party. Rock on.  So we got to the fire station (not kidding) and parked and its then that we realize we have to WALK in the mud out to the little covered area. HAHAHAHA, no it’s dark and muddy and cold, my (eer Maddy's) shoes kept falling off. But we did it, and no one fell.  The party was a blast, we were the only girls, always a plus, and the guys were hilarious. If you want more details ask, but my god that was fun. Talked to Dirk forgetting “THAT HE WAS THE ENEMY” whoops my bad, met new people who I apparently have classes with, whoops sorry bout that….and went on some new adventures.  We went home around 1ish and slept at Steph’s, woke up early the next morning and went home.   I went shopping with my family, always fun, my poor grandma was freaking out about those really really short skirts they have at Nordstrom’s, “Do they wear these over their pants?” I didn’t have the heart to say no, or to tell her I thought that skirt was super cute…. But she concluded it was “something that Britney Spears would wear” and she hopped none of us would wear one….ep… After like 5 hours at the Tacoma mall I went home.  5 minutes after I was home I went to Britt’s who was all sad (M I hate you) we went to dinner with Maddy at Applebee’s and filled Britt in on the fire party adventures she missed out on… After fighting where to meet up, we met Dirk and Chatten at the Texaco “ON PLUM STREET” which was dumb because we just ended up meeting more people at Tumwater Safeway. Well after like 3 hours in damn parking lots we decided to go bowling, laser bowling. Yeah nice try boys, no body has laser bowling on Saturday nights in Olympia, no not even Aztec lanes, nope not Tumwater, nope not Westside.  But we went to Westside lanes still, where as we were drive threw downtown, we all notice this truck next to us. Dirk does the customary “guy nod” and he does it back. But he doesn’t go away…. Maybe he was captivated by the country blasting or maybe he was gay and found Dirk attractive, I don’t know…. But I do know he followed us to the bowling alley. Which provoked Maddy and me to screaming we were going to get rapped, or Dirk was….  We jumped out of that car made a pit stop at Chatten’s big truck to tell him “hurry were going to get rapped, THAT GUY FOLLOWED US ALL THE WAY FROM LACEY” and bolted for the door. I never saw our stalker again, which is always too bad.   Bowling was interesting, I hate bowling, I never have fun bowling and I was hella tired and suppose to be home at 11 (whatever) so I was pretty much in a bad mood, and people are dumb, but I have to admit watching “Cleatis, Peter Pan, T money big time, PIMP and Rufio” was highly entertaining, especially when T money big time, fell in the lane….  I headed home around 12 30ish, and talked to people on line until 2 30ish and had some good times.  So far its 12 30 now, I have suffered no consequences for my late arrival.  Plan for the day is clean out FeFe’s bowl, burn a cd for my cousin, go to my cousin’s in Tacoma, do some homework, but no worries you can call me through it all. And please do chances are I will be bored.    quote of the day:  "NO i love this song, its my football warm up song" Dirk about "Jasmin"  Music that fits my mood: anything we listened to last night  Today i heart with all my heart:  funny boys, wild parties and hot fires

Dorothy stopped by this evening and ate dinner (THAT I MADE) with the family, always fun, went to small group, always fun  Three important rules for breaking up Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to Prolonging the situation only makes it worse Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly Don't make a big production Don't make up an elaborate story This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene If you wanna date other people say so Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected Even if you've gone together for only a short time, And haven't been too serious, There's still a feeling of rejection When someone says she preferres the company of others To your exclusive company, But if you're honest, and direct, And avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you brake the news, The boy will respect you for your frankness, And honestly he'll apeciate the kind of straight foward manner In which you told him your decision Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you will remain friends  I'm head of the class 'm popular I'm a quarter back I'm popular My mom says I'm a catch I'm popular I'm never last picked I got a cheerleader chick  Being attractive is the most important thing there is If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond You have to be as attractive as possible Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean Wash it at least every two weeks Once every two weeks And if you see Jhonny football hero in the hall Tell him he played a great game Tell him you like his article in the newspaper  I propose we support a one month limit on going steady I think It will keep you both more able to deal with weird situation And get to know more people I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit He wont mind he'll apreciate your fresh look on dating And once you've dated someone else you can date him again I'm sure he'll like it Everyone will appreciate it You so novel what a good idea You can keep your time to your self You don't need date insurance You can go out with whoever you want to Every boy, every boy, in the whole world could be yours If you'll just listen to my plan THE TEENAGE GUIDE TO POPULARITY  UW negative for this weekend, maybe next weekend, stop crying  WAHAHAHA, lets take a vote, who wants to hear every little detail from every single moment of my life.

         A little bit of irony goes a long way      College fair thing today my top 3 choices  1. Seattle U 2. UW 3. Western We shall see how that all pans out. While the rest of my friends have started to tweak about colleges, today made me realize that I have a chance to attend the colleges I want to or at least get accepted to a few. NEWS FLASH you don’t have to have a 3.8 and perfect SAT scores to go to UW, which is always a relief for those of us with 3.4 and unmentionable SAT's.   But there’s still that issue of money, I really don’t know where I am going to find 25,000 year to attend a school like Seattle U, but if I really want to go there, there will always be a way.  But enough about college. Saturday was a blast. JSA was a no go, so I went to the baseball game with Marisa, Steph, Megan, Brea and latter Dorothy. We stopped by Safeway to get snacks before the game where Steph won a free cake!! Always fun. After the game we went to Tacoma to get doughnuts from KK for the boys, made a little stop at AF and Nordstrom along the way. Got hit on by Mexicans "HOLA CHICAS" and stuck in T-town traffic. Made it back in time to be 30 minutes late to tryouts, not that they mattered, still made it, I was soooooooo worried on account of all the 4 girls they were going to cut... After tryouts we party trained it back to OHS to watch another baseball game and then I headed home.  It was then that my car broke (but its fixed yay for my dad!!) and Maddy picked me up hung out with Britt and Maddy for the rest of the night.  Then Sunday went to church from 2-5 and then the Passion with Jenna at 6, always fun!   I had tons of fun this weekend hope all you did too.  Yay, my mom makes me happy, I am allowed to go to UW this weekend, under these circumstances, you are allowed to laugh I am: A. No partying, if she hears I partied no more college visits till I leave to go B. No boys C. No drinking D. She has to talk to Kristan (Steph’s sister) to make sure I "stay in line" Ahhhahahaha, man, and we all know I am going to follow all those rules   Hey i am going to pull my JSA card and tell you all to  urlLink Register to vote at MTV    quote of the day: "havent you ever heard of gentlemen first?" ahahhahha, christian makes me laugh, nothing like good old fashion fun fighting for parking spots  Music that fits my mood:  any country  Today i heart with all my heart:  not being the one tweaking about college

         betrayed by a kiss      Saw The Passion tonight with Jenna, yeah i dont think there are words. But i didnt cry, which was wierd considering i cried in Finding Nemo, but it was intense, i recomend that everyone sees it despite what you believe  I will update about the rest of my weekend later...   quote of the day: "Michael doesnt party...." "yeah, mom, ok...."  Music that fits my mood:  sheryl crow  Today i heart with all my heart: writting serious letters and having people laugh when they read them, oh no wait thats not loveable

YESTERDAY  Dorothy and I went out to dinner and in the process: Chased a unicycle Dorothy parked my car Left a message on someone's voicemail (ep!) Ate some good Mexican Rocked out to country Talked about "hottest male alive"    TODAY  I went to school and in the process: Learned I have 116% in English (AHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHA) Watched stupid movie aka drew with sharpies with Steph Planned a trip to visit Steph's sister at UW next weekend (ahahahah, good time to be had) Went to JSA with Britt, heated discussion Bush vs. Kerry Went and visited Britt in Mrs. Jensen's room Got bitched at for having Coke at the lab station, when we had been done with our lab for 20 minutes, hey guess what? Mr. Bassett I fucking hate you   THIS WEEKEND:  Friday: doing my mom's hair for her office party, then babysitting till One, (WHAHHAHAHA, call me i'll be bored) Saturday: JSA @ OHS 9:30- 4, soccer tryouts at 3- 4:30, Hannahs's dance @ 7, nightime at Madisons Sunday: church 2-7 (EP!!!) (but we should totally do something before 9 AM on Sat or before 2 PM on Sunday, oh man sounds like a fun weekend huh? Yeah, it sucks)   quote of the day:  Jeff P: "OH MY GOD, I TOTALLY want to go to Seattle with you guys, We can TOTALLY go shopping..."  Me: "Jeff, shut up"  Jeff: "No seriously, I LOVE shopping in Seattle..." Me: "Jeff, shut up"  Jeff: "No seriously. We could TOTALLY have tons of fun, I can buy you all something..."  Me: "Jeff, shut up"  Jeff: "OH MY GOD, just think UW BOYS, mmmmhmmmm, we can totally get trashed and stay in Steph's sisters dorm, oh my...."  Me: "SHUT UP"  (he's getting a little to good at pretending to be a girl, i think his girlfriend is wearing off on him)  Music that fits my mood: Oh i dont know, too many good stuff to choose, but i think, JUST ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE  Today i heart with all my heart:   those uncontrolable giggles

         So I'm shiftin' my life into drive I'm gettin' out Kissin' the past goodbye        Oh god, its so fun, all those pink trees have started blooming, and it makes the neighborhood look gorgeous, its almost enough to make driving to school bearable.  Woke up this morning at 7:15, ep, and it was raining, seemed to fit my mood. I was almost to school when I realized how much I didn’t want to go. I mean its not like I ever actually want to go there, but today it was worse than usual. I am contributing that to many facts: my car was warm, I had good music playing, it was raining, I love driving in the rain, and I had a test first period.  But it wasn’t that bad of a day after all, test was EASY AS HELL, but then again I am kind of a loser and really got in to the book that we were reading ( The Great Gatsby )    Period Sum Ups  First: took easy test, did Spanish homework   Second: wrote my EC play thing, tuned out Kabat, learned my grades are good this 6 week Third: I GOT A B ON MY SPANISH TEST!!!!!!! HORRRAAAAAAAY FORTH: damn math sucks... FIFTH: turned in my article on Dorothy, stalkerish? Not really, and went and hung out with Britt in Mrs. Jensen's room SIXITH: took a career quiz, while the rest of my group did our lab   I think i am getting a cold.....   quote of the day: Orangestar22: i think justin has us blocked (always too bad)  Music that fits my mood: There's More To Me Than You, Jessica Andrews  Today i heart with all my heart:  showers

         dirty daves, cherry coke, and my drunken family         I haven't updated since Wednesday so I will start with Thursday    THURSDAY    My math quiz got moved to Friday, that was about all that happened at school.   Went to Steph's to study for Spanish. Someone very nice who has Spanish 5th gave us a copy of the test because they had to take it a day ahead of us, so that was nice. So we studied that and just when we were finishing up Jeff M. Called Steph and we decided to head over to bundas to do the history. Well lucky for us by the time we got there they were done, so basically it was just a big homework copying party, hung out over there for a while, always entertaining. And left and went to Britts for a little bit then went home and fell right asleep.    FRIDAY    Had to take Brittany and Scotty to school and we had extra time so we decided to go and get coffee but on the way my mom called and she couldn't find her keys. Long story short they were with me because I had driven her car last night. So I dropped them off at school and headed back home. Then went and got coffee, I only have English 1st its not like we actually do anything in that class. So I got coffee for Britt and I and drove back to school where I drove aimlessly through the parking lot trying to find a spot but to no avail, there wasn't even any on the streets so I had to park in the stadium lot and as I was pulling in I hit one of the 500 pot holes and spilled coffee everywhere. Whahahaha. So I start the long trek in to the building and the damn coffee keeps spilling out all over my hand and it was rainy and windy and I just wanted to scream.   After school I went and hung at becca's.. Latter that evening we ended up at Brandon's, where at first I knew no one and since becca and brandon were fighting I retreated to the living room where 2 random people were and where apparently the phone was for me? Hum whatever, it was josh, so I talked to him for a few minutes and then I played Mario cart for like 30 minutes alone...It was rather sad then finally becca and Brandon joined me and then eventual Josh too. Dooodooo, then my phone started ringing and it was decided that maddy would meet becca and I at dirty daves for dinner it being almost 9 now....Whatever, so we ditched the boys, who had wanted us to go to some party with them....   After dinner we got ahold of the boys to say we wanted to go to the party actual, well that didn't happened, so becca was going through her cell looking for someone else with a hook up to call....I just wanted to go home, apparently that wasn't going to happen. We went to some random girls house and the rest is history because well if I was them I wouldn't want them to post that on the internet, I took part in no illegal activities thank you....    SATURDAY    For some reason I had a horrible head ache when I woke up, I don't know either. But around one we crammed into the little 2 door acura to head up to woodinville for my uncles 40th birthday. I was already pissed because my cousin Erin wasn't coming, so when I got there the pestering of my 9 aunts really wasn't appealing, "oh my god, have you grown?" Me- "No..." "Oh my god, I love your shirt, its just soooo....I just want to touch it, your probably like why is my crazy aunt touching me? Huh?" Me- "probably".   After that I retreated to the most amazing leather couch, where I always sit when I am there, its just so comfy, and watched nascar racing. AKA the most boring sport ever, but luckily I was dozing in and out and no one bothered to talk to me. Then finally my uncle switched it to the Huskies so I got to watch all the hot boys kick standfords undefeated ass. Which provoked my Grandma to tell me all about her days at UW and how her dad was a professor and that's how she met my Grandpa and I would be her second granddaughter to go there, if I do, (hint hint I think) and the 4th generation. Oh my gosh....   Then the rib guy showed up, true woodinville style we had a caterer, not that I was complaing he was kind of cute. And about that time my cousin Natalie and her exchange student showed up. Now the good times start....   After getting paid 60 bucks to throw away paper plates Natalie and I escaped to the garage to ummm, get some cherry coke? Yes cherry coke, ohhh how I love cherry coke.... Then up to the rec room to talk to people on AIM and ICQ, Veronica (the exchange student) was talking to her friends in Brazil and I was trying to be all sneaky and read her things but every two seconds I had to ask what such word was, so much for 2 years of Spanish, never once did she say I wore a striped shirt with black pants, so I basically knew nothing....Oh well   More cherry coke and the party was rockin, hehehehe, I am still laughing well, with plans to visit my cousin this summer, because we love cherry coke so much, I left Natalie and Veronica and headed home    QUICK WRAP UP:   Thursday- GOOD  Friday- School BAD, mid evening GOOD, after "dinner" BAD  Saturday- day BAD, after dinner GRRRRRRRREAT    quote(s) of the day: "OH SICK OH SICK OH SICK, i hate this kind of cherry coke"  "ooooh, god, it looks like you put lipstick on, then slept"  Music that fits my mood:  Fuck you, you ho i dont want you back...   Today i heart with all my heart:  humm, cherry coke?!

         smile youre on gameboy camera      Dun dun dun, so here’s today in a (kind of not) nut shell  Went to dentist appointment at 8, one cavity, tear but hell I was freaking cause I though I had five so that’s good I guess, BUT I got to watch Finding Nemo in the ceiling and I was happy BUT not even Nemo and his pals could cheer me up when wisdom teeth were brought up. God damn, yeah they are probably coming' out, who well its all about the vikadin baby.... then I got starbucks and went to   FIRST: watched another one of Kabat's self-edited videos....  THIRD: piñata, piñata, piñata....  FIFTH: worked on our page with Brennan, while everyone FREAKED out about nothing... WE FINSISHED OUR FASHION PAGE, its so funny, made copies of it, almost lost it and dropped off a signed copy to Britt because she was gracious enough to try on clothing from RAVE for me, which is more than I could have ever done for her. Had to pick up a page from Mr. Bassett bc he took it way from me yesterday in 6th bc I wasn’t "paying attention" ironically it was the first time in days that I actually was, but he was all ass holey and made me promise that if I dug through the garbage can for it that I would HAVE to pay attention for the WHOLE 2 hour period tomorrow, hey guess what maybe if he didn’t make up words as he went along to purposely confuse us I would....  After school: I went to the valley then boys soccer game, Ahh.... went to PANDA with everyone and bunda locked his keys in his car. Oh man do I know how that feels, anyway, off to one tree hill!    quote of the day:  "you realise that half the people who read this are going to want to kick your ass right?"

         you know by now these titles never have anything to do with my entry but are merely reflections of how i am feeling, right?       Went to  Seattle  with Britt today,  alderwood  and  Northgate  then  Charlie’s  then  Bellevue  (kind of)    DETAILS (if you want them):    We left around 10, ep a little early be still being on  Hawaii  time but it was fun we drove up to  Alderwood  first to go to  Forever 21:  "this story plays our music" "yeah it’s a little bit like us cheap and kind of slutty" "hey that kind of offends me..."  Then we went to  Northgate  to go to  Hollister  Shout out to Alex who works there and is quite possibly the hottest man alive  After that we went to  Charlie’s  which you think we could handle but no apparently not C: "Make sure after the exit you stay right because if you don’t you'll be going to West Seattle and that’s where all the gangsters are..." 20 minutes later J: "umm, weren’t you suppose to stay right...." B: "long string of swear words" Majority of time at Charlie’s was spent looking for his senior pictures and starring at his poor dog. C: *holding picture of his dog* "Look it only has 3 legs" J: "I know I have seen your dog before" C: "But really look, you can really tell in this picture" J: "Yeah, I know...." then nick came over for a while and the boys left to go pick up Charlie’s cousins from the airport so we headed towards  Bellevue  to see TJ. But when we got a hold of TJ he was skateboarding in  Redmond  (LAME) but "meet me at Bell Square" but no thanks we were kind of mall-ed out so we headed home all weirdly on I-90 or whatever its called.  Hung out with Maddy after I got home, went to Target heard all about her spring break. It’s really not fair that both her and Britt met boys this week! What about me??   quote of the day:  "I FUCKING HATE SEATTLE"  Music that fits my mood:  The reason  Today I heart with all my heart:  hearing all about peoples spring breaks

         Like Seattle only cleaner      Went to Chopsticks for lunch with the soccer girls today but Isaiah wasn’t  working because he was coaching his varsity boys at NTHS (they had half days, I know so not fair)  so we headed over there to harass him, ended up at Wendy's for lunch with him and TB and didn’t get back to school till 6th (whoops)  Left for Portland around 5 and I am currently in the hotel lobby using the computer, I am a nerd I know but the rest of my family is asleep in my room. We leave early tomorrow for Hawaii, where my goals include: A. to get tan B. to meet boys  C. to find some guava juice  Had fun today with my sister we went in the sauna and  then went swimming and goofed around, drove aimlessly around Portland  looking for a Safeway, found one, and I bought the new  Cosmo to entertain myself  on the plane  along with my 2 new cds from Britt  But  don't freak out about me not updating my journal frequently I have several solutions to the lack of communications we are going to have this coming week. A. text me B. call my hotel C. I am going to write in my "real" journal" and post  it online when I get home and who knows my hotel there could have a computer too.  Ahhh I don’t know what I am going to do without all for  you for so long!!! Because seriously when it comes down to you guys  (I am assuming if you read this we are friends) rock couldn’t ask for anyone better.  Ep I am getting tired and I have to leave at  6 or something for our flight, so good night! Be safe everyone on spring break and especially those of you going to the U this week, wish I was there in the cloudy weather!!   quote of the day: "This drive isn’t quite as interesting as the one to Seattle" "well its about to get interesting with you going 85 through these little towns"  Music that fits my mood:  southern comfort  Today I heart with all my heart:  my friends

         TB's, sex toys and manly freshman      Yeah all the above at soccer practice, good times for sure....  As usual as we get there the NTHS varsity boys are just finishing up *deep sigh*, saw my cousin always fun, and gawked at all of their amazing skills. Practice was fun like always: I just don't think the new girls understand our humor yet... But all was good because our TB (team bitch) or Dylan as some people like to call them joined us again, one can only hope more boys from his team follow his lead....Which reminds me Saturday practices are with them!! Which sucks because I am going to miss the next two due to Hawaii, yep oh well.    Well the rest of my day was fine, I know I an really good with the descriptive words today but I am really not in the mood to elaborate.  So I leave you for now to go read Grapes of Wrath and work on my pinata!    quote of the day: Britterz452231: holy shit, i really want this all to work out Britterz452231: just to say i messed around with your cousin Britterz452231: cause its sorta like a mini jerry springer  Music that fits my mood:  keith urban, youll think of me  Today I heart with all my heart:  soccer boys

         I never said I'd take this lying down      Last night as I was innocently watching Everwood the phone starts ringing and so I answer it not recognizing the number, "Congratulations you have just won one millllion dollars, come outside to receive your prize." Ummm okay, like 2 seconds later the doorbell rings and I answer it to be bombarded with plastic darts, what the hell.... After a few seconds of confusion Hillary and Christian appear, funny guys really....  The "McLarson" gang as Christian referred to them as, where out "terrorizing the neighborhood" I was happy to hear that they scared Bunda more than me, ahhahhaha, after a few minutes they took off to get Mai-lan and I returned to Everwood.  But of course they weren't done, about 15 minutes later there's a knocking on my window and the doorbell rings so I open it and there is one of those big yard waste bins on my front porch, and I can see them running off towards 30th, Christian screaming about the McLarson gang ruling or something....  God I love my friends....  Period Sum ups: first: didn't go (sleep) second: didn't go (sleep) third: played stupid games and listened to Allison talk about her capital boyfriend, again fourth: took a math quiz fifth: hung out with Britt in the library and went to my counseling appointment sixth: left early because Mr. b was droning on about something irrelevant  Went to Old Navy after school with Maddy and then took my sister to soccer, did all my homework, started packing for Hawaii and now its not even 9 and I have nothing to do.   quote of the day:  "But that's why we like her, because we hate her"  Music that fits my mood:  blink 182- I miss you  Today I heart with all my heart:  getting 2 bags, 2 tank tops and one tee shirt for under 30 bucks aka Old Navy

         Spread wide      oh man, good times were had yesterday at church..... Let see the lady next to us like yelled at me because I my palm fell on the floor and I didn't pick it up (WTF) and just went crazy with Britt and Dorothy.  LETS DO A LITTLE ANALYZING (remember this is a church song) Your love is extravagant  Your friendship, is intimate  (now I don't know about you but when I hear intimate I think sex...) I feel like  moving to the rhythm  of your grace  Your fragrance is intoxicating, in our secret place  (intoxicating? Once again negative connotation and "secret place" WOW!!!)   Spread wide in the arms of Christ , is the love that covers sin. (ep) No greater love have I ever known; You considered me your friend. Capture my heart again.   Which reminds me, anyone remember that zipper song from church.... yeah I think I have the lyrics somewhere, I'll have to find them...  I don't feel like talking about this weekend at all because I am just too lazy so here's a quick outline  Friday-  babysat  Saturday-  soccer meeting- Britt downtown- family party w. britt (aka her staring at my cousin)- downtown to concert- dorothys-ryans- spencers-home  Sunday-  concert with my dad- church- target with Dorothy- my house with Dorothy- britt came over- sleep   Period sum ups:  1st- it's official Mr. Kabat is a communist 2nd- Mr. kabat is a communist and I got 100% on the quiz! 3rd- listened to Allison talk about her boyfriend and how they are going to the wrapped tour (jealous) 4th- got some homework done and gave Chris the answers to the quiz in English 5th- I actually worked!! Ok so it was for half the period and all we did was take pictures but still, read britts journal and then went and visited her and Morgan 6th- stared at Mr. B's cool screen saver then started reading the hella confusing packet on cloning or something  Soccer practice tonight and I need to get a bathing suit because I leave for HAWAII on Friday!!!!!!!! Oh man............   quote of the day: "she had car troubles this weekend" "Meaning my cousin got high and backed into my car" *oh man I love our lunch table*  Music that fits my mood: tipsy  Today I heart with all my heart:  I don't even know

         Then it hit me from nowhere, everything I feel about me and you       I am not in the mood to talk about this weekend yet, but I will, so don't worry all of you that only read this just in case I mention your name....  Going to church tonight, Palm Sunday and all, plus I still need 4 more issue nights at Life Teen (DUMB) whatever, at least I have mastered tuning out things and day dreaming.  It was sooooo nice yesterday, today seems really depressing in comparison  my shins hurt.  soccer practice tomorrow, I hope this year is as fun as last, and we have to go to good tournaments too...   quote of the day:  "you only liked his music because you thought he was cute"  Music that fits my mood: Kimberly locke- 8th world wonder  Today I heart with all my heart:  MTV's "Pimp my ride"

      Are our parents retarded? Like seriously? I mean they have to know what we do late at night, but regardless they continue to let us do whatever, leaving us alone for weekends....  So! This weekend pretty much consisted of two things for me this weekend:  Friday. I spent the night at Britt's and changed plans about 8 billion times it pretty much ended up us being losers, by choice I might add, up in her room.  Saturday. I went home washed my car with a little aid from my Father, watched some Real World with my sister. And headed up to Tukwila with Jessyca and Brennan. AHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA. Good times were had in that car. Well no we weren’t just going to Tukwila to kick it. We did have soccer games. SO the game was at 8 and it was fun, on field turf and under lights, always cute...Anyway, we got our asses kicked, hardcore 4-0. Ahhh oh well, nothing like a u-19 P1 team to start the tournament. Got home around 11pm, crashed and went to sleep.  Sunday. I filled out some job application, looked at the girl state scholarship form (what a bitch) and watched some more MTV. Then in the afternoon Britt took me up to my games in Tukwila. We were there early so we wandered around aimlessly looking at the boys and what not. Ran in to Laura, who was watching her brother’s game, heard all her drama. Britt left to hang out with Quint and those boys in Seattle while I got my ass kicked yet again on the soccer field...then I had an hour break between games, chilled with Brennan and Kikko mainly, tried a little soccer tennis, ep. Then we went to our last game at 8 where we SUPRISE!!! Lost, hardcore again, like 5-0, ouch.  Britt came and picked me up and we headed back up to Seattle to hangout at Myles. Which was "rocking'" it was Quint, Myles, Myles’s sister and this random guy. But soon the sister and the random dude left so it was just the four of us, them drunk, me tried as hell and Britt, well I don’t really know what she was all bubbly and "ahhhh"-ish, if you know what I mean.   Myles and Britt left to go to the "store" whatever. So we just watched MTV, wild boys? Dumbest show ever, I think I feel asleep. Headed home from Seattle around 12, with me talking a mile a minute about anything and everything (I think Britt was going to kill me) managed to get home by 1, 2 hours later than expected without anyone noticing.       quote of the day:  "damn it, I hate soccer bitches" "ummm, I think we are soccer bitches" "oh, yeah, right..."  Music that fits my mood:  breakfast at tiffany's (despite what VH1 says)  Today I heart with all my heart:  hot showers

          You know what's wrong with you, Miss Whoever-you-are? You're chicken, you've got no guts. You're afraid to stick out your chin and say, "Okay, life's a fact, people do fall in love, people do belong to each other, because that's the only chance anybody's got for real happiness." You call yourself a free spirit, a "wild thing," and you're terrified somebody's gonna stick you in a cage. Well baby, you're already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it's not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It's wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.     So i was just up in brittanys room and i was looking at all the pictures she has on her door and i was thinking "damn this girl has so much fun" and as i looked closer at each indivdual picture, i stopped being jealous of all the fun she was having and realized i was there in almost everyone. I guess sometimes we forget all those random Tuesdays and early Saturday's. Everyone is always caught up on who they are going out with this weekend and really the best friends are the ones who call you up on random Thrusdays to go case downtown.  Dont forget who your weekday friends are when friday rolls around

         Don't really have much to say but I figured I would give you the Period Sum ups of today  1: watched a movie in Kabat, almost got sent to study hall with Steph because Kabat didn't want to "personally come over here and remind you to be quite, especially since [he] had already asked us twice (whoa! What? No you didn't!) so SHUT UP!" ok so the communist is crazy and an ass, I was kind of tempted to keep talking just so he would send us, I have never been there, I bet its a lot better than his class. This period I also learned all the Spanish vocab for the test 3rd (just like yesterday with the body parts)  2: McDougall talked about the book for a while then we just sat around.  3: got our test back from yesterday 34 1/2 out of 37!!!! yay, my Spanish grade is going UP, and took another vocab test.  4: same as every day in Math, Mr Grosey teaches I sort of pay attention  5: finshed laying out my page that we have until next Tuesday to complete I guess this means I can go visit Morgan and Britt now!!  6: people presented their presentations, but I didn't!!  After school plans: I have no homework (well okay I have math which I might do since its only like 5 problems) laundry, go to the valley and sleep, extremely boring but I like it!  PS: what the hell was up with lunch, ehhhhh   quote of the day:  "i dont think any of the people at this table like me" "Does anyone at this table not like him (i forgot the kids name)" insert the 4 of us looking around in akward science until Meagan goes "I dont like him" nice.....  Music that fits my mood:  ?????  Today I heart with all my heart: my strawberry and watermelon swirl gloss

       urlLink    OUR TRIP  YAY! I am finally updating this, schools been kind of busy and I've been extremely lazy/tired, so that's why!  (numbers correspond to map, just for a visual)  1. OLYMPIA, ahh sweet O-town, how I love the....So much that I had to get the fuck out before I went insane from all the artificial self invoked drama. So around 11 (4th period) on Monday Britt and I split and headed to Spokane. The drive was quite uneventful, and thankfully we didn't stop in Seattle as someone had wanted to....I slept a lot and just zoned out until we got to 2. North Bend, I am not actual sure if that is where North bend is on the map, I think its farther east but whateves... We stopped here and got delicious slurpees, yum yumm, I then went back to sleep, other random stops were made and some where along the way Britt's mom called and told us to stop in Ritz vile because there was a tornado in Spokane, "WHAT!!!" 3. Wasn't until the drive home so just hold on 4. We pull off in to Ritz vile, whose name is completely misleading, if you know what I mean. We decided to go to Zip's. God awful, white trashy lower than McDonald's establishment, where we run in to a crack whore and acquire 50 dollars (see britts journal for details) We put more oil in the car, yeah that's right WE did, all by ourselves. (Erin that should make you happy a house wife that can check and add more oil to her car) Then we headed towards 5. Spokane, the roads are horrible, it was raining and I was pretty sure I was going to die, I tried to sleep but too scared, it was dark and creepy out and Spokane had this odd looming darkness around it, shiver.  We made it to her grandparents just fine ate and crashed at like 10 and didn't get up till 11 the next morning, we then went shopping downtown and at the mall, which was really fun. Nothing like carousels and giant wagons to put you in a good mood! That night we went out to dinner and then saw a movie (ep) and went to bed pretty early again.  The next morning we left around 11, and the weather was still pretty bad we stopped in  4. Ritz vile again and at the 5. Ginkgo (sp) scared tree place, ghetto, we got home around 5ish and I went to bed early again  Overall it was a  very very relaxing trip

         Figured I'd update once more before I am off to Spokane for the weekend with Miss Britt, good times to be had for sure. I still cant believe my parents are letting me go, it doesn't make sense. I cant drive up to Western to visit my cousin, "but sure go ahead and drive all the way across the state with your best friend whom you are sure to cause trouble with" Whatever, I am leaving this horrid city and that's all that matters.  Sadly they are fun things I am missing, I cant really think of any right now but all through the week I just remember say a lot "Sorry, cant going to Spokane"  I don't know if there's something in the water or if peoples allergies are getting to them but everyone's been super bitchy and I've had to bite my tongue hard to stop myself from unleashing on extra-bitch people, which I realize makes me bitchy too, but god damn if you don't like it don't sit there!!!!  So proud of myself I did all my homework and everything else around the house I wanted to get done before I left (laundry, fish bowl, clean room, homework, clean out car, thank you cards...etc)  YAY, off to bed then Britts picking me up and were off to school for 3 hours then up to Seattle then out east, call my cell anytime I am sure I will have it, I mean when do I not have, (hahaha steph always makes fun of me)  Oh Jesus I am all over the place tonight, so I am going to go, have fun be safe, miss me (for the whole 2 days I am gone!!)   quote of the day:  cant think too sleepy  Music that fits my mood:  isnt Paris Hilton releasing a single  Today I heart with all my heart:  road trips

         I have spent a greater part of the period bitching about how much I hate this class and typing random url's (ex: iamsofuckingboredkillmenow.com) and hoping they are sites (it wasn't)  Bean Dip is sitting next to me its being funny as usual, its giggling currently after reading what I have written, I wanted to show bean dip some funny bush pics because I know how much it hates bush (but don't we all really) bean dip apparently likes the strokes....hmmm Mr b's big ass is infront of me, maybe he hates me because he reads my journal and hears all the crap I say about him. Bean dip is telling a story about getting pushed of a chair and keys, and about how she's not stalking Jam, it has to keep its status....  10 minutes left then I get to go home, actually I am going to go to subway to get my free 6 inch sub, then I am going to buy my mom a present because she is angry at me.  HERE Bean Dip is going to write you all a special message: I have one thing to say to all of you: YOU GOT SERVED.  jen and kiley are sitting behind bean dip and I, we are in the library, doing research on a bio ethic topic of our choice, mine you ask? Gene therapy,exciting eh?  Sometimes I was I was Canadian and didn't have to pay for health care and then I remind myself if I lived in Canada I wouldn't have Bush as my president, that I believe is reason enough to stay in the states, because Bush is like God, look at everything he has done for this country (bean dip just remarked "wait god didn't fuck everything up, yes its correct but apparently bean dip didn't detect my sarcasm)   quote of the day:  "dude, bush isn't dumb"   Music that fits my mood:  last caress by misfits  Today I heart with all my heart:  anything but microbio and that jerk that has a bull cut that's got a gross girlfriend that treats me like I have the IQ of a 10 year old, that may be true but at least I've got good hair, and in the real world that's all that matters

         FRIDAY: School, and then I went downtown with Brennan to get coffee then to Capital to see Jimmy. Around 5 I went to St. Martens to serve dinner for this church benefit thing. Keynote speaker was the superintendent of the Olympia School district (aka RIF guy) that's always fun. Headed over to Kileys for the night. Around 10ish went with Mai-lan to check up on her house, everything seemed good to me, went back to Kileys. Around 12 Katie and I went and picked up a friend, Katie was way excited it being her first DD-ing experience.  SATURDAY: Katie and I woke up bright and early and left Ki's to go to soccer, uneventful as usual, we voted for captains (my predictions Karen and Kiko) After practice I went home and showered and went to Matt's to work on our English project. Went and hung out with Britt and Maddy, then went to a confirmation rehearsal. After that I went and babysat (extra sad it being prom night and all....)  Sunday: Watched MTV all morning and went to my confirmation at 5. 2 and a half hours later, I was confirmed and getting very cool presents, yay, I forgot you get presents!!  Monday: 1/2: presented our project, and did this thing about the bus boycott, our group was so hyper it was interesting: "yeah there aren't any good boys to like so I just keep them as friends with benefits" "TWEET TWEET" "You know when you get really bored and then get really hyper?" --"like right now?" "I feel like I am high or drunk or something" 3: still hyper 4: Mr grosey talked I spaced out, realized I have alllll my homework to due my WED, got Chris's' homework to copy 5: hung up apply to journalism signs (WHICH YOU SHOULD DO) and talked to Mr. B about our grades (brennans and mine) which I fucking hate him, he laughed when I told him the grade he gave me was my lowest, he thinks I am a dumbass, which makes me slightly sad then I remember that he is a dumbass and I am relieved 6: tried to be extra nice and attentive in order to boost my grade, but I think we all know he grades based on how much he likes you....   quote of the day:  "you're just having one of those days"  Music that fits my mood: I breathe in and breathe out  Today I heart with all my heart: Charleston chews

         left a note and said i am sorry i had a bad day again       I feel really bad for everything that happened last night. I realize that it wasn’t all my fault, but I cant help but wonder if I had just done one little thing different things would have turned out better. It was kind of like the depression in the sense that it wouldn’t have been that bad at all if all of the things had been single events but they all came with in a 24-hour period it was bad. I want to try and fix it all. Mend hurt feelings, and broken friendships, but that would require much more than a PhD in psychology, both sides would have to be able to bend a bit, and right now I don’t see that happening.  I don’t understand why one person is getting all crap, when really there was another person too who should have gotten the blame (namely me) and in some cases more than just one. It makes me wonder if there is an underlying issue, and if that is the case people need to stop using petty little issues to blow up at people. Grow some balls and try and tell the person why you are annoyed preferably with out the aid of alcohol, because 5 minute long voicemails with you slurring all over the place, pretty much make you’re points a little less valid.  Friday night was living proof that I need to learn to keep my mouth shut and just because you were telling the truth doesn’t make it okay to tell even if you are trying to make someone feel better.  Okay I am done ranting, I wish I could get out of this town and the artificial drama that everyone creates, its dumb, I wish I was the one driving south on 1-5 to Portland, or hell right now I hate this place so much I would settle for Tacoma.  Moral of the story: find your true friends early in the evening and don’t let them go....  Sorry....   quote of the day:  "do you promise me you will never go crazy on me and leave me because right now youre the only friend i've got."  Music that fits my mood:  fuck off song- reel big fish  Today i heart with all my heart: true friends

         send a wish out to the air, just do the carebear countdown       Lets mix it up a bit today and start off with the  PERIOD SUM UPS : FIRST-THIRD: slept, I was sick…. FOURTH: sooo lost, all I need is a hot math tutor by Monday FIFTH: let see sat around, got on AIM express, and wondered around the school SIXTH: plucked my eyebrows (for science purposes only of course, no really, to get our DNA, cool huh?)  I went and picked Britt up and then we headed to get Brennan and off to the play. Ehh, I am really not much of a play person so we left during intermission. We all jumped in Morgan’s car to find something but it being a Thursday night at 9 in Olympia we expected to find nothing. But what we found were hot Seattle boys, yumm, yumm. Some youth and government thing at the Capitol (side note: they weren’t church boys for real, they were just kidding) They were nice and all but more good times were to be had so we left cruising around downtown in Morgan’s P.I.M.P-in' explorer.  Gawked at the craziness’ those streets hold, wished we were black, and took lots of pictures. Yeah totally realize how lame we sound but really what else are we going to do? Study for AP tests, I don’t think so.   Ehh, other things happened too, and they were funny at the time, but now I am not so sure.   I am waiting for my sheets to dry so I can go to sleep, but I am tired now so I think I am going to go crash on the couch.   Plan for tomorrow:  school---computer boy is fixing my computer YAY!!!!---Hanging out with the girls (good times for sure!!--   quote of the day:  "so when are we going to have our go bush party" "ohh i was thinking tomorrow"  Music that fits my mood:  50 cent, the ultimate rapper (kidding....)  Today i heart with all my heart:  thursday nights downtown at 9

         I never put wet towels on the floor any more      so i am sitting in journalism, bored out of my mind. Mrs. Ensberg is doing AP test so Kabat is here watching us....let see, how many people are working in this room? No one seriously, one girl is sleeping on two chairs, Chris is mutlating a picture of a baby in photoshop, theres four people in the corner laughing over something in the corner, theres like 6 people on the floor talking about prom and thats about it. So bored, and HE wont let us leave the room. I hate school. HATE IT....  I am going to go because this isnt curing my boredum. >

         Are you excited? I am excited!       Saturday night: I went home ate dinner with my family, took my sister over to her friend’s house and ran to Safeway to get some sort of caffeine. Of course half of the population of Olympia was there, notably Dorothy, Marisa and Kristen. Got a drink and headed down to the river where Brittany and a whole bunch of the guys were.   Ahhhahahaha, I felt like I was in a realllllly bad cowboy movie when I got there. About 6 guys were sitting around a portable BBQ bitchin’ about how there was no ketchup and then there were a few more (dirk and Chatten) throwing this “thing” in to the woods on the other bank so their dogs Rebel and Susie could go get it. “REBBBBBBBBBBBBEL, get it dog, get it done” in almost amusing redneck tone…. hummm.   So finally they leave and we all sit around their trucks and waiting for something. I am still not sure what we were waiting for and I don’t think it ever happened. After a while Britt and I left to go to her house. We met back up with them later went to Tiffany’s while we once again sat around waiting. I hate waiting I hate indecisive people. They finally got what they were waiting for and around 11 Britt and I got bored and left.  We went back to her house to get blankets, a flashlight, and huge bag of popcorn. And off we went to the McKenny field where we had planned to look at the stars. But it was a little cloudy so we just laid and talked and wrote out a list of things to do before we graduate. Not as gay as it sounds I promise. We went on the swings, seriously I don’t think you are ever too old for swings, I love swings, I wish I had someone to go to McKenny right now with so I could go on the swings.   Anyway today I went to a soccer partyish thing at Oldschool with last year’s team and had to leave early to go to Tacoma (shudder) for a Girls State meeting, surprisingly I knew like 6 other girls besides Tierney going. Yay, I am kind of excited for it now….  I just want church to be over because I really want to go get slurpees     quote of the day: "Ummm, is it just me or did that pot look funny?"  Music that fits my mood:  SHerly Crow- if it makes you happy  Today i heart with all my heart:  my hair straightner

         Saturday was eventful.  It started out good. Brennan and I hung out during the day, went out to lunch, walked around downtown and went shopping.  Hung out with Maddy and Britt in the PM, we sat around Britt's kitchen table for what seemed like hours discussing everything. Picked out our sex in the city characters, and if you need me to tell you who's who then you obviously don't know us at all because its pretty obvious, or at least it was to us, but that could be because it is us. Yah know? Okay anyway, so we decided to watch sex in the city, so Maddy and I headed over to my house to pick them up....  There was a nice scrapbooking all night party going on at my house (insert 5 40 year old women sprawled across my family room with enough paper and sisors to fund the entire Olympia school districts art program) so we grab the tapes and look at everyone's pages (insert us "ooooooo"-ing and "awwww"-ing") went back to Britt's because as I said before my house had been taken over.  Watched Sex in the City for a while, I got bored. We went to Top Foods, its all about the bulk candy, went to red robbing, saw Ellen. Went back to Britt's, met up with Krystal, went to Black Hills party. Which had its moments, but with out going in to detail lets get the basic gist: white trash...quads....Neighbors...Crabs....Toilet paper...And almost getting run over by your best friend...  Went back to Britt's in a panic and I am done, I think I have bad party karma for a reason....    Tic'Tock:  7 13  Stylin':  jeans and a jacket  Hair:  oooo its cool, so proud of myself  Eating:   nothing  Drinking: snapple diet ice tea (its gross)  listening:   nothing  Chatting:  no one  Stalk Me:  aim: Gorjessgirl4

         Yesterday or Thursday after soccer I stopped by Britt's to drop off some of her shit that had been accumulating in my room. We sat around her room talking before we decided to go to Red Robin for fries and ice cream.  it was there that we had our first inkling that god really does exist, because A. We got free fries x2 and b. The hottest 3 boys were sitting at the table across from us and they were way cool so we kind of talked to them and then we left to rent sex in the city from Hollywood.  There as were getting out of my car we glance to our right and there is the hottest man alive home from college. Oh Jesus...It was all I could do to remain composed and damn his girlfriend, I hate her....  Well whatever, we headed back to my house to watch the videos got harassed by Face the Jury freaks and yep just a normal Thursday as far as I am concerned.

         Saturday after I got back I went and hung out with Maddy and Britt, it was soooo nice out so we went downtown and met up with Morgan and went out on one of her paddle boats, vroooom vroooom, that was so much fun I love all of those girls, and I always say you're first few days of summer predict the rest so I know mine is going to rock. The rest of the night was spent trying to find something to do....  Sunday I slept till 2 because well I had gotten NO sleep at girls state, my cousin called and was like " I HAVE TO GET OUT OF OLYMPIA RIGHT NOW!!!" so 2 hours latter we left for Bellingham.   Monday Erin and I explored Western, okay I love that school, went on a picnic and went shopping it was so much relaxing fun.  Tuesday I drove home and it took forever and was scary at times, but I made it, headed over to britts and we went to morgans volleyball game then came back to my house and did random shit on the internet, hehehehhe....

         Some entries while at girls state   Hopefully finals went well for everyone, girls state rocks and sucks at the same time. I am in still in shock that everywhere I go are these girls who are absolutely amazing: never have I been surrounded by so many intelligent people. Today I was walking to lunch and overheard three girls debating the pro’s and con’s of capitalism, socialism and communism. I love this, just ten minutes ago I was changing my opinion on affirmative action after hearing a “real” minorities point of view. It’s so easy to just assume everyone has it like I do, but that isn’t the case and I feel like a horrible person for being so presumptuous. I guess the thing that really matters here is keeping an open mind.  Its getting old with all this women’s lib shit. Not that I am not for girl power, I mean I am here, but its almost man hatter, let’s take over the government thing, which isn’t solving anything…which makes me wonder if equality is ever really going to happen or if its just an idealism. Equality is perfection right? And perfection is never obtainable… Yeah I am discouraged too, but I am still going to fight hard, idealistic equality may never be achieved between races or sexes but it sure can get better than this.  *************** Where I should be: in Mr. Grosey’s 4th period Algebra 2 class B-ing a final. But I am in a 1964 central dorm room from hell listening to music wishing I was in Oly…. *tear* I have 45 minutes until I find out if I made it into the House of Reps but as much as I hate math I wish I was there gossiping with Mel, making fun of Richards hat and getting my “surprise” form Chris, but you know whatever.  My phone bill is going to be huge, yeah, oh well, I am way excited my mom is going to let me go to Bellingham!!! Going to see if Natalie wants to go too. I am excited and I think Erin is too! Have I mentioned how much I love college boys, yeah! Hahaha so long as they don’t go to WSU, no just kidding, J  I was talking to Britt last night about a developing crush I have that I figured was an absence makes the heart grow fonder deal and she explained it was “you’re surrounded by girls and you have to think about him otherwise you’ll become a lesbian” deal but my roommate, who is a way cool non-bitchy Seattle (shoreline) girl, were discussing how we could never be lesbians because they you’d have to deal with bitchy pms-ing dramatic girls forever, yeah (it made so much sense late at night)  ***************** Currently I am in my house of reps meeting (yay I got in) for 3 ½ hours, no worries, I have my journal, Cold Mountain, my cell phone, and now brain teaser cards our house whip gave my row to pay attention. Dude there are so many prudes here, they didn’t pass lowering the drinking age to 18, it was 33 to 22, angry. I swear I put my water bottle in my purse but its not there, I am so confused, this wouldn’t be so bad if we only had to debate the bills to be approved but we sit around doing nothing. **************** I miss all the girls in my city because they rocked!!  QUOTES:  "theres only two things stopping me from sex, STD's and babies"   "Have you ever seen ms congeniality, because you remind me of Miss Rhode Island"    "did i do something wrong, is it shrinking?"

          Friday I went to Morgan’s with Britt and attended the Nisquallly Middle School dance, NICE!!! Ahhahhaha, more people came over, we had some good times looking at old yearbooks, and watching you got served.  Saturday I babysat and packed for girl’s state, which I have decided to attend. I am pretty excited a little worried about finals and what not.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, ran into Mr. Bassett as Safeway, he had a 6 pack of Olympia beer. Not that its horrible that a teacher drinks beer but that he is so poor he has to buy cheap ass “lets get trashed” high school beer, my heart almost goes out to him.  I need to get some sleep because I leave at 8 tomorrow, going to miss you all, but I will have my cell and you know the number!!!

         Came home from my cousins because I thought I had lots of homework to do, but upon closer inspection I have none. You know what come to think about I never have any homework, its been such an easy year in retrospect.  Anyway, I’ll talk about this weekend backwards just for a little change, Sunday, today, I woke up around 12, watched some crazy movie on channel 11 and then went to target with my sister to buy the Taking Back Sunday cd because I had lost my copy. Which reminds me, Taking Back Sunday’s new cd comes out July 27th, I am so psyched I seriously cant wait. I tried to cheat and get some of the tracks early off limewire but there were only 3, but they are good…  Well since Saturday night I left my cell phone in my cousins car I drove over to her house. We ended up watching Monster; wow, umm, yeah! that was a crazy ass movie. Then I headed home, and now I am here.  So back to Saturday morning I woke up at 9:15 quickly threw on my soccer things and headed over to Oly for soccer practice, nothing like waking up to an hour of hardcore conditioning, which is the way our last three practices have been. Went home showered went to Erins, since she was home for college. Went home had dinner and then meet Erin at this little coffee shop I am have wanted to go to forever, I love it. Its got huge comfy chairs and fireplaces, and so fun. Then we met Britt downtown and did nothing all night. Which reminded me so much of last year, tear. Contemplated crashing a party but realized that we were too good to stoop to those levels, hahahha.  Friday I ended up driving around with Morgan, it was really fun, yep.  Schools almost over, thank god…     Tic'Tock:   7:43  Stylin':  sweat pants baby  Hair:  down  Eating:   nothing, but i am starving...

         I guess the issue is I have nothing interesting to say, after the half day Britt and I stopped by my mom's work to get my check!! yay, after saying hi to everyone we left and hit up our banks. Then went to chopsticks for lunch, nothing like a free meal to make you feel good...Morgan came and joined us and we wandered around downtown.  Went to Barnes and Noble for like 3 hours, oh how I love that store, bought two books (SAT vocab book and Roberts Rules of Order, because thats how cool I am) then realized I locked my keys out of my car, nice one Jess... Yeah so that was fun, actually it wasn't too bad I got some starbucks and sat in those big chairs and read, a little sat, but my mom came a little later and saved me, she was not happy, especially since I do that all the time....  Hmmm, so I am not doing anything tonight because I am probably the biggest loser in Olympia. Everyone either has SAT's tomorrow, is going to the dance or is "going to the dance", seeing Harry potter or getting drunk and really only one of those sound like fun tonight.... But I am pretty sure its already sold out....(tricked ya huh?)   this is a sign you spend too much time with a person  FunkySnoGrl: so what are u and Britt doing must work on that one  AHHAHAHA, at first I was like "cool, nothing to do this weekend, yay, I can read and clean my room and do all that kind of stuff" well my room is spotless and I already read a lot today so now I am just sitting around feeling sorry for myself!!  OH MY GOD! The republican party has called me twice in the last 2 days and they go "How important, on a scale of one to five is it that a republican president be re-elected to the white house" I asked if they accepted negative numbers....  Anyway, I am boring myself and I am sure you so I am going to go do something I am just not sure what yet. But if you're reading this and its still Friday call me because I am obviously hella (yeah I just said hella) bored.

        Our application favorites:  Question is about deadlines: "i think consequences are important if you fail. But how i see it is, why are you in this class if you cant work hard enough" (editors note: girl turned in application handwritten in marker on ripped out paper....nice)  "Writting has always been one of my favorite hobbies. No, not hobby, my passion."  "attendance is important so i attend class"  "I love birthdays.....its tradition to embarrass the birthday person with something special. i would bring in a nice, big cinnamon swirl cake. Two layers of soft, homemade icing, your teeth sinking into the frosting for 2 seconds before you finally reach the cake. The sweet taste of swirled in cinamon that make your stomach grumble and your mouth water. And one pure white candle in the middle just waiting to be lit." (same girl as before attached this as her writting piece" "my special gift is heather mustard...she is something so beautifully unique, she is like a hard to find flower, so rare, it is unidentified. her very presence makes you breathless, like that calm, winter silence that makes your soulders rise with exhileration...not only is she beautiful on the outside. Her long, sandy hair glows with softness, and her Hawaii ocean eyes shimmer more brilliant than the rarest gem. Her figure brings her to womanhood..." (it goes on like that for quite a lesbian way for a while)  "i am strong supporter of seeing student pilloried whipped, and jeered at for their mistakes and would recommend these alternatives...just kidding"  "its hard for me to rate myself on creativity because i think its subjective"  "i own one and half horses" (what the fuck does that have to do with journalism)  wow that was fun    Tic'Tock:   7:32  Stylin':   soccer shorts and a teal tanktop  Hair:  up in a pony  Eating:   nothing  Drinking:  nothing  listening:   to brennan reading peoples papers  Chatting:   with brennan  Stalk Me:  aim: Gorjessgirl4

      So I love the color green now. I am not saying green is the new pink or anything, but its more mature, I think. No no no, I am kidding, I hate people who talk like that.  &nbsp;  currently straightening out with the rumors with Andrea and Jesus people you need to get your facts straight  &nbsp;  and ps certain pot heads with blond hair who frequent country concerts need to stop telling people that I "smoke weed all the time" and am "always trying to buy weed" from&nbsp;them and that I am a "pot head" because I think most people know that isn't true, because it isn't.

      So yesterday has come and gone and I have forgotten a lot of it, so basically, as you probably read in Dorothy’s journal, I hung out with her for practically the whole day we:  &nbsp;  Bought hemp, the legal kind, to make bracelets  I scared the crap out of some Seattle girl at Michael’s, hahahahaha  “Smoked” “cigars”  Got a history lesson from a 8 year old “So where are the Huns from? Hunland?”  Debated about going to soccer game, went won! Whoo hoo  &nbsp;  Then I got home and Britt called or I called Britt I don’t remember, anyway, some how I agreed to go to Lakefair, yes I don’t know either. Okay seriously I think everyone from Olympia High School was there, as you probably knew because you were probably there and chances are you probably go to Olympia. Yeah anyway, saw people I didn’t want to see, blah hate that. Went on the Ferris wheel, shit I hate it.  &nbsp;  Afterwards Brennan, Dorothy, and Jimmy went to Denny’s and we all acted out little Lakefair and other scenes with our silverware. It was quite entertaining we ate, gossiped, and made fun of the white trash, nothing new for Brennan and I. Dorothy and I got the best posters ever, with Chad Michael Murray on them. Okay I love him, I want him….  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   LIKE OMG! WHAT IS YOUR SN? &nbsp;  &nbsp; LOL, WTF, don’t you already gotz mine?

        Friday I woke up went to weights with Steph, whahahha, so sore, like seriously its Sunday now and I can barely dress myself.  Anyway after weights Dorothy Steph and I went downtown, got coffee, visited Britt and laughed our asses off, because were dumb.  Went home then 20 minutes later Dorothy came back over, we sat around for a while then took showers, respectively, and got ready just for the hell of it. Which worked out because we were suppose to meet people for lunch. So we did, but went to Old Navy instead, where I bought more shit I don’t need. Seriously I have a problem, someone needs to help me, so if we ever go shopping and I am buying a purse or a pair of shoes, rip it out of my hands and ask me if I have seen the state of my closet recently, okay…  By now Maddy had joined us too, so we went back to my house played Uno and then everyone left.  I did some laundry and got ready for soccer. The car ride up to Tacoma was quite humorous. And the game was really fun. I now remember why I like soccer so much. The intensity was amazing, despite the 1-0 loss, oh well, I missed a wide open goal shot which could have tied it, so I felt like a dumb ass but yeah. Got home around 10 and slept and slept and slept.  Around 2 Steph picked me up and headed again up to soccer in Tacoma. OH MY GOD WE ALMOST DIED!!! Innocently enough were driving on 1-5 in the left lane, when we see this truck with a trailer fishtailing in their right most lane, and then all of a sudden the truck is perpendicular to us, stretched across all 5 lanes of traffic, were about 2 feet away from hitting them. It was silent for the longest time until somebody giggled, “I wonder how our team would have done without 5 of the starters?”  The game was lame, because we should have won, tied 2-2, and I made up for yesterdays almost goal squabble with one this game, afterwards we quickly got food and headed back to the field to play another game. We ended up winning, thanks to an awesome goal from Erica (Katie’s little sister) who was quest-ing with us. We missed playoffs by points, which makes me bitter, because we probably would have been going if I had made that first goal… but third is just fine and this way we don’t have to go back up to Tacoma today…    Tic'Tock:   153  Stylin':  pink pj pants and a tank top  Hair:  up  Eating:   nothing  Drinking: nothing  listening:  nothing  Chatting:  no one  Stalk Me:  aim: Gorjessgirl4  PS. this is luckly post number 100, isnt that crazy, i have written 100 of these, wow, i am a loser

        I GOT TO SLEEP IN THIS MORNING AND IT FELT TERRIFIC, I woke up talked to my daddy, learned my car, oh my god I don’t think I have mentioned my car drama in detail yet okay:   SO lets see, bear with me if you have heard the whole story already, So basically its being retarded and wont start or it will start but it wont run for very long. Apparently its a gasket, yeah whatever, so anyway we had it toed to Gary’s auto shopish place (I think I told this part already) so that was last Friday. Gary informed me it wouldn’t be until Tuesday that they would look at it, damn Independence Day. So Tuesday morning I am getting ready for weights, actually I was laying in bed watching TV and the little bar across the bottom says "Gary’s Automotive in Olympia, caught on fire early Tuesday morning, damage to cars inside" AHHHHHHHHHHHHH I am like what the fuck? SO I call my mom and my car was inside, so I am freaking and my dad calls, he’s in Oregon with his wife, and is all "Hahaha, oh well what can you do? Lets just hope it’s not totaled" yeah thanks dad, love you too.   So I freaked out for 3 days until I learned my car was the only one without ANY damage! HAHAHAHAHHA, my mom was like "I don’t understand?"  And I was all "I do, God loves me"  And the end. Its still going to be forever till I get my car back, they haven’t even taken the cars out due to insurance reasons, so blah, but I am just happy my car isn’t broke any more than it is!  So then I watched Bernstein Bears with my sister and ate Pop Tarts, Dorothy called, I got in the shower. Dorothy came over.  We made a cd and discussed the idiocy of the male species. Came to the conclusion they have no regard for our feelings, oh well what can you do, I mean besides go all lesbian.  Went to soccer and I fucking hate the freshman, unleashed my bitterness on Hannah, learned the freshman have been calling us bitches, ahhhahahaha, well shit son...  Went to weights got to ride in Alex's awesome car it was so fun, worked at weights, it felt good, my legs are going to ache tomorrow, but I am going to max on my squats, I only did 95 today but I think I can do way more, we shall see.

         Yesterday was Wenesday and last night was a little too hectic to update so I do it now:  I went to weights as usual, and it was uneventful as usual. It was the first day I didn’t do anything. No seriously, I stood outside with that damn jump rope for at least an hour. And of course Jeff comes out from basketball camp and is all “do you ever work here” and what not, but he did make an ass out of himself when he tried to teach me how to jump rope and when Mr. Grosey came out and yelled at him for not working, ahahhahaha, sweet justice.  After weights I went to Maddy’s. And her dad makes me laugh, Jesus, we sat on the couch for a couple hours watching MTV 2’s fugliest (sp?) rock stars and CMT videos. Then Britt came over and we migrated upstairs to Maddy’s room to watch country videos. We planed our college road trip and we were our usual only-funny-to-us selfs, so I wont rehash the details here.  Went home crawled in to bed and started to sleep, then my phone rang, blah sometimes I want to throw all the damn phones out the window, but it was cousin with boy drama. My advice still stands at REBOUND. Anyway after that I FINALY got to go to sleep. Until my mom comes barging in at 7, “don’t you have a soccer game?” Well shit son, I did, so I threw on my shit and hot tailed it over to Pioneer Park, where I actually found a spot, YAY!  We lost, woo hooo big surprise. I do believe when I signed up for this rec team I thought we were going to win all these games because we had all these select and varsity players, but what the hell is this about competitive rec, HOW THE HELL DOES COMPETITIVE REC EVEN MAKE SENSE??? Anyway the highlight of the game had to of been when Kristin L and I were talking to some girl on the Black Hills (High School) team (which reminds me are we the only school who doesn’t have a varsity rec team?) and she was all “we’re all from Black Hills” and Kristin was all “ohhhh funny we’re all from Olympia” and I go “Yeah but their team is all varsity and half our team has never played soccer before” ahahhahaha, damn black hills girls who think they are all better than us…. I mean they do go to black hills so why would they think that.   Headed over to Dorothy’s after getting a little simple Life time in and we umm played video games like the loser we are. Its all about the super Nintendo, the controllers with out the damn moving sticks, I don’t know what they are called, anyway Donkey Kong rocks my world and MOOOOOOOOO.

         Fourth of July:  I was just about to hop in the shower when my phone rang it was my glorious cousin Erin who called to confirm my attendance at the annual Swift family fourth, I "sadly" said "no" but apparently she didn’t take that as an answer so 25 minutes later she was there to pick me up and I was fully ready, so proud of myself shower and over night bag packed in under 20 minutes.  Anyway we then start our drive out to our Uncles on Steamboat island, sat around talked with the aunts and what not, got bored so we did our traditional escape-the-family shopping trip this year with Natalie, yay for her. God I love those two seriously I would never ever be able to handle my family with out them....  We met Britt at the mall got some Starbucks and headed back ready to face the family, now fully caffeinated. Ahhahhaha but we didn’t stay much longer just a quick "hi, this is Brittany and were leaving" to everyone and Britt and I took off for her cabin on Hood Canal. Ate. Made small talk and left about an hour later drove allllllll (the hour) way back to O-town, watched TV, took depression quizzes with Britt’s mom, it was highly entertaining.  GASP we didn’t even watch fireworks which was fine by both us, so around gasp again 11 we headed up to Britt’s room to go to sleep. But finally that Rock Star I had drank on the way home had caught up with me and I couldn’t sleep. I laid on the pull-out-couch of sex dreams and completely re-decorated my room, in my head of course. I was at that pivotal moment of pre-sleep where you are just about to pass out when Britt's phone goes off; it’s about 2 now. Only one type of person calls at 2 in the morning, a drunk one. Yep and he was, or so he says he was....  SO Britt talked to Myles, and I talked to Myles, and Myles talked to himself a little too, all in all it wasn’t that bad of a conversation despite the fact that we were then up for another 2 hours. I really want to hate him but he’s doing a good job of getting on my good side....   Today: went and visited the grandparents, went swimming with my sister, watered my dad's plants, got sick, hung out with Maddy and Britt   Tic'Tock:   12 09  Stylin':  shorts and sport tank top  Hair:  up in a towel  Eating:   nothing  Drinking: nothing  listening:   nothing  Chatting:   no one, I im-ed Dorothy but she didn’t answer...

         Well I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinnin' around, trying not to look down  But you did and you fell, hard on the ground   You stumbled around for a good ten minutes  And I said that I've never seen anyone look so dumb before  But you laughed and said "I still know how to turn you on though"   You are the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  And you are the only one who  Knows exactly what I need   And I probably forgot to tell you this  Like that time I forgot to tell you about that scar  Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?   See you're not what I expected  But you're the only one who know how to handle me  You're such a great kisser, and I know that you agree   And you are the only one who  Who drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  And you are the only one who  Know exactly what I mean   I hope you can forgive me for that time when I put my hand between your legs  And said it was small, cause it's really not at all  I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down  Just to keep you around, cause the day you that you realize how amazing you are  You're gonna leave me   You are the only one who  Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick  You are the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   And you are the only one who  Drives me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You are the only one who  Knows exactly what I need   Exactly what I need   I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinning around, trying not to look down  But you did and you fell, hard on the ground    Tic'Tock:   5 17  Stylin':  jeans  Hair:  down and wet and cold brrrr  Eating:   nothing  Drinking:  nothing  listening:   dorothy  Chatting:   me and emily  Stalk Me:  aim: Gorjessgirl4
