      A very fearful incident happend this morning on 12.xx a.m... "A happy day turns into a fearful night" "Take contiousness own safetiness" It was the hightest speed limit my car can reach.For your infomation,i drives a 1.3cc manual Kembara.140 km/h was the speed on the north south Plus highway.Just only a couple of kilometers distance almost cost my engine to a severe damage.There,i was afraid of damges from light till heavy might happen to my car.Luckly nothing happned on the dark and quiet expressway.Thanks to this incident,once again i've learned something more about cars.  What a day in school...sleeping for about few hours in class because of that incident happened earlier.I just manage to sleep for 4 hours at home before the rush to school.After all..i've relearned something during chemistry class. "Learning something that was once learned"

      'As days passes by..there will be something waiting ahead!!' My daily routine are so normal today..so bored of everything.Besides bored,i need to put more effort on my studies for my coming SPM trial on 6/9/2004 followed by the real SPM on 2/11/2004. Decisions has to be made from now.However,i still fear of something. The fear of failure.Not because of the achivement on further studies but the fear of loosing pride and status of mine.What shall i do to avoid all this?There is only 1 answer...hardworking with wisdom.

      'For every begining,there is an ending' "Time passes every moment,time cannot be frozen"  So, the day is over..luckily i did not meet someone which i hope not to meet.It was a joyful night worthing a rememberance..I brought my senior advisor along but i felt that i'ed isolated her by kept on chatting with my friends.I felt a little sorry to her.I'm not sure wether she minds bout it or not..she just kept saying its ok its ok or no!won't..thats all..but afterall i really appreciate she went to the school drama with me.This senior advisor of mine is one of the person i respect the most...Finally i concludes this blog with saying thanks to my senior advisor and i had a very happy night.

      "Be qaulified before justifying" Have a confident mind and enough proove before doing,taking action or justifying ourselves.  It is quite a bad day today in school today.But on the other side,i'm quite happy of it! Its like a self achivement since last year.The story is simple,an uncompatible teacher was acusing me that i did not do a work.However,i prooved myself right and she was ashamed by her owan foolish actions and meaningless talks.Thus her shamefullness by misusing her power.At last,thanks to my friends i never did something stupid.  1 more day to SMI's school drama...There will be a show today.Too bad I'm not attending it. Actually i am saving it for tomorrow..

      "Day by day..all the same" Some people says a day passes very slow,while others say its extreamly fast.No matter what,we must make use of the time which everyday provides us.  Now back to reality..So there is just 2 more days to my school stage play.Actually its 1 more day including today,but i'm refering to the day i'm going. Many incidents might happen in a day.In just 24 hours,it can be a last day of a men's life. The thing i'm going to share today has nothing to do with that.Friend we make has various types of attitude,temper and personalities.Sometimes,those behaviour might cause a little misunderstanding to each other which concludes a broken friendship! If you are a person with wisdom,you won't be easily fooled by such madness. So next time if anyone comes in such situation,remember...

      The day is finally coming!The day everyone waited throughout the whole year.. It is my school's most proudest event of the year...The School Stage Play... This event had brought to me many unforgetable memories the past few years(nothing to do withthe show). Anyway..life is like a journey.No matter how hard the journey is,we must still go on.. Hope everyone who are going to the 'Drama'  enjoys it..
