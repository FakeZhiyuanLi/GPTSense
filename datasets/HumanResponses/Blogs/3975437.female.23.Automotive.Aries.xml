      I have a couple different people in mind when the word annoying comes up.&nbsp; There is one person in particular, a girl who shall remain nameless.&nbsp; She is a genuinely good person and a good friend, but she also knows how to work every last nerve in a human body.&nbsp; Her idea of, &nbsp;"I'll call you later,"&nbsp;means that she will call you in a matter of twenty minutes.&nbsp; The funniest part is that she will call with her regular number, but if you don't answer, she'll call right back blocking her number from the caller id.&nbsp; I have made a joke about it a couple times, so she is aware of the fact that I know it's her.&nbsp; I've asked her not to do it, but she doesn't get it I suppose.&nbsp; She has a habit of calling at the wrong time as well.&nbsp; For instance, I tell her not to call me before 5 p.m., she calls at 4:45.&nbsp; As annoying as she can be though, she is still one of the best friends I have.&nbsp; I know that I can depend on her if I ever need help with anything.&nbsp; She is always there for me if I need a shoulder to cry on, and she can depend on me.&nbsp; We have been friends for a very long time, almost 10 years.&nbsp; Everyone has their annoying habits and if we don't learn to accept that, we will never really have any friends.

      After five years of not being in school, most of the people I associate myself with question, why now?&nbsp; Well the answer is easy, I want to better myself.&nbsp; I've realized that nobody will help me to be successful except myself.&nbsp; I am at a point in my life right now where I need to focus on my career.&nbsp; I have many goals and things that I would like to accomplish, but everyday that goes by I realize that I am pushing myself further from this goal.&nbsp; I know that I am capable of being successful but I am my own worst enemy.&nbsp; I prevent myself from doing many things by not having my priorities straight.&nbsp; Not this time.&nbsp; This time I am prepared for the challenge, I'm going to embrace my future and allow myself to grow.&nbsp; There is a song with lyrics "time is on my side", but in reality, all time does is work against you.&nbsp; Each day that passes, life becomes harder, so now it is my opportunity to fight time and make my life easier.&nbsp; I am proud of myself for being back in school and I will be successful!&nbsp; So stay on my good side because one day you may need a job at my firm!

         "IT'S BEEN TOO LONG AND I'M LOST WITHOUT YOU..."        -AALIYAH 1979-2001     MY FAVORITE PERFORMER IS AALIYAH. AALIYAH DANA HAUGHTON WAS BORN JANUARY 16, 1979 IN BROOKLYN, NY. AALIYAH WAS AN ANGEL THAT HAD BEEN LOST FROM HEAVEN ONLY TO BE FOUND BACK IN THE SKY AFTER ONLY 22 YEARS ON THIS EARTH. AALIYAH, MEANING THE HIGHEST, MOST EXALTED ONE, WAS EXACTLY THAT. IN 1992 SHE RELEASED HER DEBUT ALBUM, PRODUCED BY R.KELLY, AGE AIN'T NOTHIN BUT A NUMBER AND I WAS AMAZED. SHE WAS ONLY 15 YEARS OLD AND ALREADY HAD A VOICE THAT WOULD FOREVER IMPRINT IN YOUR MIND. EVERYTHING ABOUT HER JUST SHINED. AS A CHILD SHE HAD PERFORMED ON "STAR SEARCH", BUT DID NOT WIN. LITTLE DID THEY KNOW. SINCE SHE WAS 15 YEARS OLD, SHE WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT AND NEVER ONCE LET IT GET TO HER HEAD. SHE WAS LOVED BY ALL THAT MET HER. EVERYTIME YOU SAW HER SHE WAS ALWAYS SMILING AND IN HER INTERVIEWS SHE WAS ALWAYS HUMBLE. SHE WAS ONLY 2 YEARS OLDER THAN ME, SO SHE WAS A ROLE MODEL WITH REALITY. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I COULD RELATE TO ANY OF HER SONGS. ANY OF THEM. HER MUSIC WAS HER LIFE AND IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER THAT HER MUSIC BE SOMETHING SHE BELIEVED IN. THAT COULD BE THE REASON FOR THE PASSION IN HER SONGS. IN 1996, SHE RELEASED HER SECOND ALBUM "ONE IN A MILION." IN 2001 HER SELF TITLED THIRD ALBUM WAS RELEASED. HER LAST ALBUM, "I CARE FOR YOU", WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER, 2002. (ALSO A TRIBUTE ALBUM) I PREVIOULSY REFERRED TO HER AS A PERFORMER RATHER THAN A SINGER BECAUSE SHE ALSO WAS AN ACTRESS. SHE STARRED IN "ROMEO MUST DIE","QUEEN OF THE DAMNED", AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE TWO SEQUELS TO "THE MATRIX." ANYTHING SHE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK SHE COULD HAVE. SHE WAS  "ONE IN A MILLION"  AND  "MORE THAN A WOMAN."  ON AUGUST 25, 2001...AT THE AGE OF 22, AFTER FILMING THE VIDEO "ROCK THE BOAT" OFF THE LATEST ALBUM, SHE BOARDED A SMALL CESSNA PLANE RETURNING TO THE U.S. FROM THE BAHAMAS. HER VIDEO WRAPPED UP EARLY AND SHE WANTED TO RETURN HOME TO HER FAMILY AND FIANCE DAMON DASH. SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY EIGHT OTHER CREW MEMBERS. THE OTHER PASSENGERS KILLED IN THE CRASH WERE-- "Scott Gallin, 41; Keith Wallace, 49, of Los Angeles; Douglas Kratz, 28, a representative for Virgin Records and Eric Foreman, 29, both of Hollywood, California; Gina Smith, 29, of New Jersey; and Christopher Maldonado, 32, of New York. The pilot, identified only as L. Marael, was also killed, and Anthony Dodd, 34, of Los Angeles, died in the hospital on Sunday." - urlLink http://abcnews.go.com/sections/entertainment/DailyNews/aaliyah0010827.html  THERE WAS ALOT OF CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HER DEATH, THAT THE PLANE WAS OVERLOADED BY EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS. THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS MADE THAT AALIYAH AND HER CREW WERE TOLD THE PLANE WAS OVERLOADED, BUT THEY WANTED TO GO ANYWAY. ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS RETURN HOME. THE PILOT, NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. AFTER INVESTIGATION THE PILOT WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NARCOTICS AND UNLISCENSED. INCAPABLE OF MAKING ANY SOUND DECISIONS. OBVIOUSLY, HE TRIED TO FLY A PLANE OVERLOADED BY NEARLY HALF A TON. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE PLANE WENT DOWN FASTER THAN IT ROSE. AALIYAH WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN KILLED INSTANTLY. THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS...GOD WAS MISSING HIS ANGEL, HE WAS SEARCHING FOR HER, FOUND HER AND DECIDED TO BRING HER HOME.  TO ALL OF THE FAMILIES...GOD BLESS YOU TO ALL THE VICTIMS...R.I.P... YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN

      This issue is soooo true.  I am a white woman, but grew up in a non-white world.  Living where I did, if you did not have money, you didn't fit in with most kids.  Unfortunately, it usually came down to a race issue.  So being that I was broke growing up, I got to see the difference between the two worlds.  I like the poor world better.  My mother made an impression in my mind to be skinny and pretty.   I ended up anorexic.  Even to this day, I am psychologically bulimic.  If I feel that I look fat, I'll throw up.  I think it's ridiculous that it has to be that way.  The spanish and black girls that I knew were never told that they had to be thin.  They were told to "eat the rest of that damn food" on their plate.  It's a very sad issue but a reality.  I think they should make Barbie fat or at least realistic.  Maybe less girls would have eating disorders that way.  But we do have to look at it as it is...a toy.  There are alot of toys out there that give impressions to our children that could be even worse.

      Damn this is a touchy subject...would you rather have your child feel restricted and as if school were jail, or take the chance of your child being shot?  I have mixed emotions on this issue.  My first reaction to this issue was that it depends on where the school district is, but a good friend of mine brought a new light to that statement.  "Look at Columbine."  That made me instantly look at the situation differently.  How do you make a decision like that?  What is more important?  A parent obviously wants their child to be safe at school, but do you want your child to feel like they can't be safe anywhere?  Growing up where I did, there was never thought to be any threat to our safety, until the riots happened in the cafeteria.  Or better yet, the bomb that was found in my school.  The worst part about the bomb was that the staff knew, but never dismissed the students.  Rather, they searched for it while school was in progress and kept it on the hush.  How safe does that make you feel?  It's the same principal as September 11th.  The airport had metal detectors and screening processes, but they were ignored, and the terrorists were able to set off those alarms and still board the plane.  That's just sickening to me.  So what makes a school any different?  A metal detector could be beneficial, but are the people monitoring it capable?  I think a good way to go about it would be to have metal detectors, but possibly hide them.  Have a guard at the front door, and something within the door frames that could x-ray as you walk through without your knowledge.  Only the guard would be able to see on the monitor.  We have the technology, but never use it.  I have so many ideas, yet I can't fully agree with myself on any of them.  Regardless, another issue still remains, if you are able to keep the danger out of the school, what about the other16 hours of the day?
