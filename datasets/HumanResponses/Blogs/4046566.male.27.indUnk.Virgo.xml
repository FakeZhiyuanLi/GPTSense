        Hanging :          Is it right to hang anybody to death??? I mean...who r we to kill somebody?          If he is a criminal, why r v becoming criminals again by killing him...that too pre-planned...he would have committed the crime in a moment of emotion...          If we feel he is dangerous to the society...why cant we imprison him till death instead of killing???          Most dangerous is...wt if it is proved that he is innocent, 2 yrs after he is hanged??? Can we bring him back to life???

        Ant :          The rate at which science is developing, there will be a day when we can implant a Micro Chip in an Ant's brain and decode the signals in our language.          For an ant, living in MG Rd., MG Rd is the country and Bangalore is the universe. If a car is being parked for a long time., lets say a month, that's mount everest for the ant. If it shakes it is an earth quake.           Imagine we are also like that...living in a gigantic world and there are gigantic people...and their life span is 10,000 yrs...          WHO KNOWS???

          Telescope :          Imagine we establish contact with an alien planet which is 400 light years away...both of us have powerful telescopes and signal receivers...and imagine, they are looking at our planet....          wt will they see...can you imagine...they will be seeing Sri Krishnadevaraya, Napolean, Akbar etc., on Earth...coz light takes 400 yrs to reach there. Couple it with Radio signals and listen to the commentary from that planet...we will come to know wt they were doing...

        Imagine :           The technology increases at the pace it is now, we travel at the speed of light, and we reach a planet in some other milky way...some other galaxy.          That planet has the same living conditions as mother Earth and there is life....oooh!!! and they are in Stone Age ;-)          When we get down there in our space suits, in our space craft with guns and other weapons......WE ARE GODS FOR THEM. Our Space craft is Pushpak Vimana, Our weapons are Asthras etc.,          Imagine, the same thing has happened when we were in Stone Age....I feel thats how the concept of GOD has come....

        I have one more thought : may be in another 5 yrs, there will be no travel...its all virtual meetings u have. U put on a helmet and the other person in Delhi will put on a helmet...u ll choose a meeting place [Ooty, a beach in Goa etc.,], configure and both of u will be there virtually...

       I have a thought : One day...near future...there will be a stage where one can buy lungs or other human parts on the net and they have a home delivery and will be replaced at home. You can get designer parts like dotted lungs, cartoon lever, denim heart etc.,
