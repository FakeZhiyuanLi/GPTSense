Woody Allen   &nbsp;  Bisexuality immediately doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.

Golf is a sport for white men dressed like black pimps.   Tiger Woods   &nbsp;  My mother never saw the irony in calling me a son-of-a-bitch.   Jack Nicholson   &nbsp;  Clinton lied. A man might forget where he parks or where he lives, but he never forgets oral sex, no matter how bad it is.

Robin Williams   &nbsp;  Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place.

Doctors are reporting that many men are having allergic reactions to latex condoms. They say they cause severe swelling. So what's the problem?   Dustin Hoffman   &nbsp;  There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men think, 'I know what I'm doing. Just show me somebody naked'.   Jerry Seinfeld   &nbsp;  See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time.

Joan Rivers   &nbsp;  Sex is one of the most wholesome, beautiful and natural experiences money can buy.   Steve Martin   &nbsp;  You don't appreciate a lot of stuff in school until you get older.
