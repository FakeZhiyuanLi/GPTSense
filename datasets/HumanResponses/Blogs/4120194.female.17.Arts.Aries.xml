      Well today was eventful... in an everyday sort of way. I woke up this morning and decided to get my shopping for my trip over with so I'm not doing it last minute. I drag Ryden along to the mall with me and we look for a bathing suit. After about 30 minutes of searching today and about 3 weeks before hand we finally find one that we both agree on. Isn't it pathetic that we both have to agree on clothes before we buy them. I value his opinion on what I wear the most because he's the only one I dress for and try to look good for. So the bathing suit it purchased... and it was on sale yay!! and we walk through the mall and i buy a top and a purse. By the way it's taken me all summer to find a purse that I actually like. I've never even owned a purse before and it was getting to the point where I had so much shit to carry around that I decided I really needed one. I'm very picky on this subject because I personally don't like purses all that much (hence why i've never owned one) but after about 2 months I FINALLY found one I like. So shopping was then over.  We head back home and sit down after 5 hours of wandering the mall, and watched the movie 'A Beautiful Mind'. This is now my favorite movie, next to 'Pirates Of The Carribean'.... I loved 'A Beautiful Mind' it's a truly amazing movie... wow. So after that we all went out to dinner, cause it was Whitney's birthday... the big one five. We went to Boston Pizza and it was really fun... Later on at Ryden's, he gives me this poem/piece of writing that he wrote about me. I would post it on here but i dont know if he would want me to... anyways i loved it ... it was cute.   And thats all the news today

      I can't believe this is my last year of High School. When I look back it seems like not too long ago I was wearing "indoor shoes" and having recess.  Years are flying by and I couldn't be happier with my life at this point. I have a awesome, understanding, loving, helpful ect. group of friends. I finally know what I want to do with my life occupational wise. I have a steady job with good pay. I have my family who are finally starting to be supportive of my decisions and we are getting along great. And I have a man in my life who I love very much, who loves me back and who wants to spend the rest of his life with me.  I mean sure, there is the occasional problem with atleast one of these things... but it is so insignificant that nothing is going to take this happiess away from me. I love where I am right now and I wouldn't trade what I have for anything.  Thank you everybody for always being there and for making my life so gosh darn super. I wish happiness for all of my family and friends, I love you all.

      My work shifts usually go from 9 or 9:30 to between 4 and 5:30. Ryden's work shifts go from late afternoon (4ish) to about 11 or midnight. When do we see eachother?????? Thats a tough one. I mean don't get me wrong I'm happy for him now that he's working.... because he can spoil me. Just kidding. But it just kinda sucks that with only a week left to spend time with him i will hardly get to see him. And then I'm away for 2 weeks... then its school. And it starts all over again. School, homework, work (nights for him weekends for me) and sleep.... hmmm somethings missing.... oh yeah hot sweaty loving from my stud... when is there time for that??? Yeah I know what you thinking, "jeeze Stephanie be happy that the hot sweaty stud loves you"  Well you know what i say to that? "You're right" I feel like one of the luckiest people in the world just because that hot sweaty stud loves me, and lately I've been taking that for granted. Sure, there's fights, arguements, jealousy, crying, yelling, hitting (dont worry i'm the one hitting him haha), and well some hurting. But all that is so small compared to his love, kisses, hugs, smiles :), charm, personality, sideburns, hair, tight little ass, strong hands, lips, gorgeous brown eyes, and his yucky hairy feet. I admit even though there are some little fights every now and then, its totally worth it knowing that when the fight is over... all the good stuff is still there. Its just hiding behind the fight.

      Lately things haven't been going too well, but like always I immediatly run to Ryden tell him all my problems and we talk it out. It's nice having someone to talk to about issues and what not, especially when that person can help me solve the problems... even the problems that involve that person. I love the fact that I feel so comfortable telling Ryden anything and everything.  I recently came to Ryden about a problem, which was that he hardly shows me that he loves me, cares for me, and wants me anymore. I know he does, but it's always nice when he goes out of his way to show me that. But I had been feeling that maybe since we've been dating for such a long time, some of those feelings might be going away. Once again, I'm thinking way to much into it. So we talked about this problem of mine many times, and he understood. So he has been trying a lot harder now... and he claims it doesn't feel like any effort what so ever.  So after our long fight, Ryden drinking a whole bottle of tequila, and our "almost break-up". Things are much much better. We woke up the next morning and the 'beginning of the relationship' jittery lovey dovey feelings all came out. I know I know ... Stephanie you loser. But you know what ... whatever it feels good. So the day started off Ryden taking me to his house to finish sleeping, then him making me breakfast, us having a nice long shower together, watching a movie, and him actually taking me all the home instead of just dropping me off at the c-train or bus stop. So by the end of the day i have to admit I'm feeling pretty good.  Little did I know the next day would be much better... well Ryden had an interview during the day but afterwards we went over to his house and he ordered us my favorite pizza and he actually went out and let me rent the movie "Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen" and surprisingly he watched it with me too!!!! So its around 11:30pm and we're laying in his bed almost sleeping after watching Family Guy, and we get out of bed and walk to a ridge over looking the city. We lay down a blanket under the stars and lay there and watch the meteor shower. I was feeling as if I was dreaming or in the movies. What an amazing thing to experience... so it's arounf 1:30 in the morning and we get up and go back to his house and go to bed. I'm so incredebly happy, what a great way to spend our last couple of days together untill i leave for 2 weeks

      Monday night was one of the worst nights of my life, i dont even know how to begin. I finally admitted to myself that, my whole life has completely changed because of this one person. I always swore to myself and promised my closest friends that i would never choose a boy over them ... and up until this relationship i never have. Im not saying that my personality or who i am and what i believe in and all that have changed. But the truth is everything going on in my life has changed.... i feel like i hardly know my best friends anymore, i never talk to my own family anymore, and i have no life other than with him... or at work (which by the way i went out and got that job only so that i could be with him... long story). His life on the other hand hasnt changed one bit for my sake, he still goes about doing all the same things. I dont want to say it's unfair. I feel im sounding completely selfish right now. But when i completely turn my life around to make someone elses happy, its either saying im in over my head or that im head over heals in love.  I know for a fact that i am in love with this boy, but is love really supposed to make you do things like that? If so, then how come I'm not seeing these things from the other end of the relationship? Why doesn't he go out of his way to make me happy? I know that he loves me. But if he was truly "in" love with me wouldnt he want to do things to make me see that? Am i being selfish for wanting him to show me he cares for me? Am i being selfish for wanting him to show me he loves me? He wants me? And that i matter? Are wanting these things totally unfair to him?  Who can answer these questions?

      I never thought that this would hurt so bad. This is the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life. I can't believe this is happening, I love him so much but i can't be with him. I just wish so bad that he'll come back. I dont know what I'm gunna do without him... I've lost the one I love and my best friend at the exact same moment.

       So I'm just about to head on over to Ryden's house to continue helping his family re-model their entire main floor. These past weeks that I have been helping them have been some of the best weeks of my life. I can't believe how amazing his family is, they are some of the greatest people i've ever met. I love them, they treat me as though I am a part of their family. Nobody has ever treated me that way before. It feels so great to get invited over to Ryden's house by his parents, it's like they actually want me there.       Its so amazing we all joke around and tell stories and stuff, I have never seen a closer family then this one. His mom and sister and I can sit for hours and have girl talk. Over the past while his sister Whitney and I have become really close friends almost like sisters, and his Dad has been so open to me... its really nice having that.       They are nothing like my family, they dont sit there and tell me that Ryden and I are never gunna make it and that he will break my heart. They accept mine and Ryden's relationship, encourage it and they think it will last.       They feel like my real family

      You know at first I thought a job where you can just sit around doing nothing and getting paid for it would be awesome ... but now after 4 months I'm starting to regret it. It's more difficult to sit around and stare at a wall, then it is to actually do work that is challenging. Dont get me wrong i mean i like my job and everything and im not thinking about quitting or anything. But i really am super duper BORED ALL DAY LONG.... seriously the most exciting part of my day is when i get to do the word search from the Calgary Sun. Pathetic, isn't it? Oh well after a four hour meeting today with my boss and co-workers, i finally get something to do at work. It's not the best thing but atleast it's something. So we're starting off with 2 projects so far which are Protocol and an Organization project... fun hey? Well i get the organization project which basically consists of organizing files on computers, putting together reference binders... blah blah blah. And you know the sad thing is im freaking excited that i get to finally do some work.  I've been working all summer between 3 and 5 days a week, and im continuing to do that until the 21st. When i finally get my trip to vancouver. I love Vancouver ... and Campbell River ... I cant wait to get there. I miss it so much. Even though im gunna miss Ryden A LOT! I'm still excited to go. I get back on the 31st and then two days later school starts. Is it just me are summer's getting shorter? Either way I'm glad to be getting back to school.  Anyways it's time for me to leave .... i get to sleep in tomorrow !!!! K bye

      No matter how often I hear the words " I love only you" and " You have nothing to worry about" and so many other sayings along those lines. I still can't help the overwhelming feeling of jealousy every single time that I am reminded of that "perfection". It's not even real perfection its the kind when you notice the hard work to try to be perfect. I can't stop comparing, no matter what I do. Get over it... I'm told. Over and over from myself. Why is this bothering me so much? Why am I making it such a big deal? I admit ... yes ... i know the real truth and the real answer. But deep down I still can't get over it.

      Hey so this is my first entry.... to start things off I'd like to thank Aaron for having awesome ideas for me to steal ... and vice versa.  I finally got my flight booked for Vancouver, now all i gotta do is go through the painful trying to get that time off work. Im pretty gosh darn excited for my trip, but I am gunna miss Ryden. The week that he was up in Redlodge was hell, I was slowly slipping into depression. I missed him like crazy, maybe that phrase would mean a little more if it hadn't have been a song by the Moffats. I find it pathetic that i actually know what the name of a Moffat song is, even more that  I know of the Moffats. Why the hell am I talking about the Moffats... I need a life.  This parts for Aaron: So I just read a couple of your entries, and i noticed they are similar in lots of ways, I'm noticing a pattern. You probably thinking its none of my business, but since you are now back in my life and we are still pretty close. And it really breaks my heart when I read some of these things, because i can see that your heart has been broken. And things right now are kinda shitty. But Aaron I want you to know that I am here for you as much as i was when we were cuddling in math and science in grade 10 haha. I hate the fact that the one you truly loved isn't in a relationship with you. But the worse things get the more you will truly appreciates the good things in life. Like how you are still able to converse and still see your first true love... some of us lost that chance a long time ago. And there's always a chance your friendship together can grow into more again, and theres always a chance you could meet another person who you grow with as well.  Just live life and enjoy it one day at a time... try not to worry about whats going to happen in the future. It hurts me seeing you hurt because I still love you Aaron. You're too amazing and talented to be real. Thanks for everything .. all the memories and for making my life odd, i wouldnt want it any other way  Thats all for tonight folks
