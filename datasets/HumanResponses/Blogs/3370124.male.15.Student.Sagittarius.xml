      The bus today was so stupid. It just had to be the bus I was taking. Wait, why we're you taking the bus Matt? Well, I had to goto my orthodontist appointment. Lo and behold, I still didn't get my braces off. Anyway, I got to the place on time, but, on the way home, it took. You know what it did as soon as I got on? A u-turn, which then made me go in the opposite direction I wanted. What kind of bus does a u-turn?! Tell me.. none! I wasn't even on the bus for 20 seconds and it pulls a u-turn on me. Like, what the heck!! So so stupid. Ok, so I get off that bus and start walking around. Pretty nice day it was though. Pretty nice day to wait for another stupid bus! Took me an extra 10 minutes to get home.  I'am never taking a stupid bus ever again.

      La la di da. Another musing by me. What's the news these days?  Thirty four days till the last day of uncool school. Throw out your boots, take off those mittens, get ready. It's nearly summer!!  This is o/t but I'll say it anyway. Fantasia won American Idol.. Ugh, can you believe that? What a scum.. Kidding! She's as cool as school.

      Do not adjust your computer monitors... I've moved to blogspot! Why? Well, I was getting tired of the same old look. It is now time to start clean!  I like this blogspot thing better in some ways.. Like, it is WAY easier to post stuff. Just type it and boom, I'm done. I guess I'm just too lazy to do it myself these days.. All my old stuff has been moved here. You can still see my old web  urlLink here.   There's a couple things I still need to do here. I need to learn how to use this so I can add stuff on the bar. Yep, I'm a no0b.

      There isn't any snow left. Isn't that great? Heck no!! Thanks to all this great weather, everyone has to participate in "track" tommorow. Wooooo.. I mean: noOoooooO!!  What GOOD is there in "track ..AND field" anyways? Physical activity? Fun? The joy of participating? Competition? I don't think soo. Keep the ribbon making people in business? Yes. But that's no good. No good at all.  The forecast for tommorow is just perfect and it couldn't get any better. Thanks for nothin' you dumb weather..  Oh yes, The Simpsons is on tonight.

      Anybody watch Saturday Night Live ..on Saturday? haha.. It was the best one I saw in a long while. Pretty funny stuff it was!  "Debbie Downer" was a good part of the show. Have you ever run into someone like that? I bet we all have. "It can live in your body for years before it ravages your brain." *wah, wahh*. I'm glad I stayed up to watch it..  You can see it  urlLink here  (right click, save target as)
