      Fortunately, I get many chances throughout my day to stop and praise God for the creation that is a four year old son.  Sometimes, I'm sure to God it sounds a little more like a complaint than gratitude, but really, I can't thank God enough for the blessing of my son.  Your kids keep you humble, that's true enough.  For me, when I can tell that my son's imagination is conjuring up a whole world I can't see, I am for a split second returned to my own childhood, where I too can believe that a shark lives in the hot tub...  Tyler often has a "fetish of the week" that leaves me scratching my head and wondering if I'm not monitoring his TV intake as well as I thought.  This past week, he HAD to have flippers.  Why?  Well, of course, because there is a shark in the hot tub and the next time we get in he has to be able to kill it.  We humor him, thinking a "Jaque Cousteau" future isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Better than his incessant questioning about rubber gloves and cleaning toilets a few weeks earlier.  So, Father of The Year hooked the kid up with not only flippers, but a snorkel set, too.  We were waiting for the hot tub to warm up to an acceptable winter tempature (which for me is like 104, but everybody else seems to favor 102 or 101) and I was attending to the normal house chaos.  I knew Tyler had found a Playdough set he had gotten for Christmas.  He's pretty good when it comes to the Playdough Rules: #1 Don't eat it, #2 Keep it on the Table, #3 Don't leave it out because it'll get hard and you'll cry and beg me to buy more.  Well,  he was pretty proud that he had made a red giraffe, showed it to me briefly, and then moved on to the next source of entertainment.  In my faulty logic, I thought my husband had an eye on him.  Soon he emerged from his room in his swimming trunks and ready to go shark-hunting.  I asked him to put the playdough away first.  So he brings me the little plastic jar with a hunk of playdough the size of a pebble in it.  "Where is the rest of the playdough?", I ask him.  "I don't know," he says.  "Well, find it.  You can't get in the hot tub until you find it."  Ten minutes later, he's standing at my side whining.  "Mommy, I looked EVERYWHERE and I can't find it."  "Look again, Tyler.  You don't just LOSE Playdough.  What where you doing with it?  Is it in your room?  It better not be in your room!"  You can see where this is going.  No help from the husband to search for the missing playdough.  As of right now, it is still MIA.  In fact I am convinced that once I get the time and the nerve to clean Tyler's room, I'll find it smooshed into the carpet as an everlasting homage to red giraffes.  And when that moment comes, I'll smile and think of how my four-year-old killed a shark that night for us, just so we could enjoy an hour in the hot tub.

      It was one of those nights that I was just bored to tears looking for something to do.  Oh, who am I kidding?  I'm never bored!  But I could have been doing three loads of laundry or (oh!) filing my taxes or  scrubbing around my toilets with a toothbrush... but instead I chose to bake a cookie.  You see, there were semi-sweet chocolate morsels in an unopened bag leftover from uninhabited Christmas baking.  They called to me.... and being a faithful Atkins dieter, I decided I'd better do something with them and get them out of my sight before I open the bag and next thing you know - they're gone!  But, like any good mom I delegate my time very carefully and of course the sensible thing to do was bake one big cookie instead of wasting hours cooking several batches.  So as I started our Poor-boy Taco Salad dinner (Thank God my husband is TOTALLY picky and his favorite meal is tortilla chips, taco meat and cheese - even I can handle that!) I began mixing the cookies.  Then the almost-1 kid started screaming.  Then the sister-in-law came over to use the internet to do her taxes.  And it just occurred to me that the four year old didn't even eat dinner.  And here's how Mom-of-the-year multitasks....  Put the baby in her high chair with cut up bananas and Cheeze-its for dinner. Go back to the bedroom and pull up the internet.  The connection is not there. Turn the computer off and unplug the modem. Tell sister-in-law to turn the computer back on when the little light flickers green. Take the ground beef out of the microwave and throw it in a skillet. Add baking soda to the flour in the glass bowl. Look for brown sugar, find that it is hard as granite. Remember someone told you to put it in the oven to soften it up. So you do that. Go back to computer room.  Still no connection. Stand on desk, disconnect router and modem.   Turn everything off. Go add water and taco seasoning to meat. Check on cooking brown sugar. Add eggs. Yell at four year old.  Why? Don't remember. Go back to computer room.  Turn everything back on. Yell at husband that dinner is done. Take brown sugar out of oven and chop it up with a knife. Eyeball that it's enough to make 3/4 a cup and throw it in the bowl. Fix a plate of ghetto-taco-salad, take a bite. Go to the computer room, and help sis-in-law find the right site. Finish mixing the cookie dough, place it on baking stone.  Which I should mention is the smaller version. Yell at husband to release the angry beast from her high chair. Dough looks like it might melt a little and run off the stone, but not much thought is given to that. Yell at husband to occupy kids so I can help sis-in-law with taxes. Sis-in-law is somewhat technologically challenged, has to go though the world's easiest tax file I've ever seen like 3 times.  No problem, a click here, an adjusted gross income there, we're in business. Husband is yelling at four year old for almost slamming his sisters finger in the door. Finish cold ghetto taco salad. Start bath water for four-year-old. Smell something weird. Check on cookie, sure enough, it is dripping off the baking stone and is turning to Blackened Chocolate Chip cookie on the bottom of the oven. Open door and windows to let out smoke even though it's like 30 degrees outside. Finish up on computer with sis-in-law. Churn in envy that she'll see a refund. Yell at four year old to get in tub. The cookie, amazingly still mostly in tact and looking deliciously edible, is finally pulled out of the oven.  As I go through the much similar chaos of putting the children to bed, I marvel at the beauty that is my cookie, even though we lost some of it to The Dark Depths Below.  It still looked perfect, and even though the smell from the oven was of burnt crispiness, the cookie itself was golden brown, perfectly puffy, and dotted generously with the morsels that began it all.  House in nightime order (or the closest resemblance thereof), I try my cookie.    IT IS TOTALLY NOT DONE.    I almost cried.  The edges were done about one inch in all the way around, but it was way ooey-gooey; salmonella poisoning waiting to happen.  Alas, my cookie met it's bitter end with a quick flip of the wrist into the garbage pail.  A moment of silence, please.  My final thoughts.  It was a pretty cookie.  And I am SO glad Pampered Chef stoneware is SO easy to clean.  Nothing sticks to that stuff!!!!

      I just started a new blog trying to support the Pastor of my  urlLink church  , First Baptist of Alamogordo.  And I tried to make it very supportive and not too totally offensive.  But since this is my official ramblings page, let me just say now how TOTALLY pissed off I am!!  There are people in my church who are so completely self righteous that they are against the growth of the church through the addition of a more contemporary service be added to the program.  And why???  Because ANYTHING that this pastor tries to change meets with opposition.  I know I have a few faithful friends out there that read this, and whatever your religious background, please stop right now and say a prayer for Pastor Charles Hanks of FBC Alamogordo.  In continued rambling, let me get to the nitty gritty.  The SENIOR members of our church are supposed to be the backbone, the foundation, the people that tell everyone else to listen to the Pastor.  Ever since Charles became our Pastor, he has been dragged through countless boughts of political and control messes.  And the respect I have for the elders in our church has dwindle to nothing.  The rumor is the old people boycotted the morning "traditional" service that is supposed to be the early service.  And they won't come to the contemporary ones because somehow praise songs that include drums and guitar are blasphemy (Make a Joyful Noise?????)...  So we basically have leaders in our church saying that they are just going to stay in Sunday school on Sunday mornings.  Okay, that's the way to follow God's command to fellowship and be a part of the church body.  And way to make an example for the youth - go right ahead and tell them they need to go to church, but they won't see you there!!!  And money?  I'm sure more than a few of the people trying to drive this thing out have the notion that since they tithe, they should have control.  Yeah, that's what God said about tithing - give your 10% and then you can put down your pastor, oppose the growth of your own church and make sure not to "go ye therefore" and bring the Word to all the nations - because no one in their right mind will want to join a church, much less become a Christian after looking at your example.  I have never felt more pity for whoever it is that started this, and their inability and unwillingness to change.  I can't believe these people profess to be Christians, and I am ashamed for all Christians because these are the very kind of people that turn off new believers and people who are seeking the truth and have not yet found it.  Fortunately, I learned a while ago that people let you down, not God, and that every church has a few of those people that cause division.  I PRAY, I PRAY, I PRAY - that God will convict these people and YES, they are entitled to their opinion but, NO - THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ADVOCATE THE DYING OF A CHURCH THAT HAS JUST BEGUN TO GROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Those that oppose these changes are doing just that.... why can't they see that??????  UUUGHHGHGHGHG!!!!!!!!

      Here's the conversation I had with my 4-year-old yesterday:  "Mommy, change my name."  "What's wrong with your name?"  "I don't like Tyler."  "What would you like to be called?", as I look over at my husband with a silent plea for help with this one.  "Anthony."  "Well, Anthony is your middle name, but there's nothing wrong with Tyler."  "I want to be called Anthony Johnson."  A moment of silence from mom.  "You can't just change your last name, too.  Well, girls change their last names but only after they get married because they take their husband's name, and some don't even do  that ."  "I want to be called Johnson because I am related to Magic Johnson."  ( A.  We're white.   B.   I'm not 100% positive he knows who Magic Johnson really is, other than my husband has touted him as the all-time greatest NBA star ever.   C.   Does this qualify as gross parental failure? )  After laughing aloud and probably offending the child and scarring him for life as he was drop-dead serious about this whole name thing...  "Sweetheart, you can't change your name to Johnson and be related to Magic.  It doesn't work that way, and really, no one will believe you are related to him anyway."  We could see the whells in his head just a-spinnin', then he says, "Okay, I guess Anthony will be okay then."  What, pray tell, do I have to look forward to if the kid is already wanting to change his name???  Should I hire a psychologist now, or should we wait until he paints his room black and starts collecting vintage AC/DC t-shirts a camoflouge pants???

      I've been traumatized.  And I want to sue Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes and DEFINITELY John Leguizamo for wasting 2 hours of my life last night and leaving a psychological dent in me that even Dr. Phil won't be able to bang out.  "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar" came on last night on USA.  I hadn't seen it before and was freakishly curious about what the rave could possibly be to warrant the syndicating of Patrick Swayze as a drag queen.  It was not that great a movie, a very typical "beauty inside" theme, but really...  My Patrick-I-Loved-you-in-Dirty-Dancing crush ended with this movie.   I was wondering, were these guys thinking, "You know, these jock-roadhouse-passenger 57 movies are doing nothing for our careers.  Why don't we all dress in drag and invade a small town???"  What the hell?  Not that I have anything against drag queens, but how aweful is it that Patrick is definite eye-candy as Johnny-the-bad-boy, but he passes as a fairly decent looking woman, too?  I am so disturbed.  I didn't sleep good.  I will have to take my two copies of "Dirty Dancing" and the accompanying soundtrsck CD's to Goodwill now.    It's like looking at crime scene photos - you know a gruesome image will be burned into your mind and that you really wish you didn't possess dark human curiosity, but you look all the same and then sometimes, when you shut your eyes, you see Patrick Swayze in a dress with red hair and boobs and you pray that God strikes that image from your memory.

      An old friend recently sent me an email that characterized women as we are - multifaceted, strong and wonderful, with our only flaw being that we often  forget  how wonderful and strong and multifaceted we are.  I think it is so true.  Thinking back to recent conversations with friends this week, I have to tell you that we women settle for a lot less than we deserve.  One of these friends (let's call her... Tommy Girl) had a break-up/get back together.  The problem the way I see it (she may not agree) is that she hasn't yet had that "A-ha!" moment in her female life.  She has no idea how truly beautiful and intricate she is beyond the image she sees in the mirror each day.  I've relayed what I've learned in my eight-years and counting relationship with my husband, and not to sound sexist, but  men never think through things the way women do.  Never.  Ever.   Her me loud and clear ladies, the man in your life is noever going to "get it".  I told Tommy Girl that the "A-Ha" moment for me is the moment I succumbed to this very notion, and ceased allowing my husband's actions to get to me.  (Don't get me wrong, if he's abusive mentally or physically or cheats on you, this doesn't apply.)  If he loves you, the way I believe Tommy Girl's man does, then he loves you.  But he doesn't define you.  He doesn't make you better or worse, he just magnifies the person you make yourself.  If you are a happy person, happy with yourself, that will be magnified 10 times over in your relationship with him.  If you haven't quite figured yourself out yet, then being with him only makes your self-image blurrier.  Not bad, just blurry.  AND YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE HIM.  The harder you try, the more subconciously he will resist.  My advice to Tommy Girl was this: (and I hope it's not intrinsically wrong nor relationship-damning advice) If you love him, you have to come to terms with his imperfections.  But first you have to come to terms with your own imperfections.    I don't know, maybe I've "settled" into my marriage.  Maybe that's how it looks.  But I don't think so.  I came to the conclusion long ago that James may not be willing to change or to even acknowledge his imperfections, but I am.  And only because being the absolute best woman I can be is what God and Oprah recommend.  I've even read it in the Bible, a woman's household is defined by her hard work and loving touch,  she  is not defined by anyone or anything else.  And maybe it is that realization that has lead me to finding out what I want out of life and fitting my husband and family into that picture, instead of hopelessly looking for a place to fit in in a picture I didn't paint.    We still have our fights- money, parenting skills, preoccupation with ESPN...  but you know, I feel like I know us.  I can see our future because I know who I am and what I want, and I know that if my husband ever ceases to value everything that I bring to the table, it will be his loss and someone else's (Ben Affleck??  Chris Cagle??) gain.  And I wish Tommy Girl could see herself the way I see her - as me three or four years ago.  Jealous, angry, usually confused about life in general...  Tommy Girl is awesome, as is our partner in crime the RedHead, who also seems to be completely unaware of her awesome girl-power.  It's not a love fest, it's not lip service to the race that sustains humanity - it's the truth.  We, as women, are wonderful, powerful, multi-faceted creatures.  Our every action is motivated by what is in our hearts and what is in our heads, and too often we let that motivation be negative.    Tommy Girl, Redhead - I ask you this... (It's late and I may be stupid) If you invited Beau 1 and Beau 2 over for dinner, would you take the turkey out of the oven and serve it to them if it wasn't done yet just because they arrived a half hour before the estimated time of thoroughly-cookedness?  (How do you like that word?)  And just because they are there already, would you take out the apple pie even though it's not even close to done?  No, I don't think you would...  I think this should be true for women... The men that enter our lives come into them before we are "fully done", and we have a tendency to try to serve it up even though we realize it may be the salmonella poisoning of the relationship.  It's fine to finish cooking the turkey while they sit and wait, but they  have to sit and wait .  You think they might get impatient and leave?  Nah... guys will hang around for eons just waiting for the turkey to be cooked to perfection.  Geez, why do you think Thanksgiving is such a man-holiday?  All they care about is the friggin' turkey - not that Pilgrims and Indians first made peace so many moons ago, even though we had our fingers crossed behind our backs and took all their land and slaughtered their tribes... (whoa, way off course....)  Gosh, I'm really growing to love you guys and your love interests that I have yet to meet!!!  I hope you know that settling for anything less than your best self is cheating on life.  (Watch Oprah instead of working all the damn time!!!!)  May God bless both of you and your relationships, and when in doubt, don't listen to me - dig out your nearest Bible and read 1 Corinthians 13...  "...Love never fails..." and my personal new favorite... Song of Solomon 8:6-7 "Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave.  It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.  Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away.  If one were to give all of the wealth of his household for love, it would be utterly scorned."

      At the risk of sounding profound, I believe that there are two kinds of people.  There are people that are regurgitations of the world that is around them - people that form opinions based on what the world will think of them, as if it really cares.  Then there are people that are in the world, but not "of" it.  They do what they do because of what they believe, and they say "To hell with what others think..." and they really mean it.    I know people on both sides of the fence, and I guess to some degree we all take trips to both sides.    I was watching the news early this morning, thinking that I better get a handle on this whole democratic caucus thing, just in case I ever need to have an intelligent conversation about it.  And I realize that knowing a thing or two and being well informed is different from having an opinion.  I know what's going on towards the November election of '04, but quite frankly, I don't have an opinion about it.  I suppose I think that Bush is doing the best that he can, and being a Republican "by nature" I support his administration.  Other than hearing that Dean appears to be a liar and that everyone is loving this John Edwards guy, I've not gathered enough information to "regurgitate" my opinion on the whole thing.  So then I was reading my daily devotional, which I won't lie, is more like a three-times a week catch-up for me.  But I realized that there is such a bigger picture than anything we see or hear about the world around us.  That if I died today, knowing factual information about the Democratic caucus wouldn't at all make a difference.  What would?  I suppose it would make a difference to know that my unshakeable faith in God has been passed along to my children, and maybe to a few friends along the way.  That whether people think I am right or wrong about God's existence, they knew I believed, and maybe from that they will have a shred of wonder and twinge of ambition to find out for themselves what the whole Jesus-freak thing is about.  And that I am far from perfect, far from a perfect Christian - hence the need for a Savior in the first place.  I guess I always kind of thought that God was saving us from this world, saving us from evil... but I guess I have figured out that He is saving us from ourselves.  From the part of us that gets up in the morning and forgets that He is waiting for us to just say hello, or the part of us that gets mad and blames Him so effortlessly for things that have gone wrong in our lives that are so obviously of our own doing.  And how often does my fear of the world's opinion of me keep me from telling people of the gift I have in knowing that I am saved?  Of knowing that no matter how imperfect I am, because of His love, I am better than I was yesterday, better than I was a year ago, better than I was 5 years ago?  That the whole point of being a Christian isn't to profess to be perfect and never do anything that raises an eyebrow, it's to learn from your mistakes, to do your best to turn around and walk the other way when you are running down the road of self-destruction that is often disguised with fleeting happiness.  Does imperfection make Christians hippocrites?  No, I don't think so.  It makes them human.  And no one is in the position to judge a person's relationship with God, so no one truly knows whether or not a person is saved.    What does that have to do with the people on either side of that fence - (oh yeah, there may be a point in here somewhere)...  I've spent the last few years talking to God and getting to know myself and I am ashamed at how much time I spend on the side of the fence that worries what the world thinks.  There are those people in my life that I can look at and so easily try to judge, wondering where they are coming from and how on earth they have come to the conclusions that they hold on to.   I often tell my son to do something and he says something like, "but you're not getting ready for bed..." or "but Mackenzie gets to stay up...", and I tell him that he needs to worry about himself and what I tell him to do not what he sees everyone else doing.  In my profoundness this morning I can realize that God says the same thing to me all the time - that I get caught up in what others are doing and saying and forget to do the things I am supposed to be doing.  I want to be on the side of the fence where I don't care what the world around me thinks.  Where I can shout at the top of my lungs that everything good in my life is a blessing from God, a blessing I don't deserve, a life that is increasingly exceeding my wildest dreams.

      Have you ever owned a Frigidaire?  Don't buy one.  Let me tell you my story.  And then if Frigidaire wants to sue me, go ahead - just give me a freakin' washer that washes, dryer that doesn't twist clothes into teeny tiny clothes-balls and a refrigerator that doesn't have an out-of whack fan that rattles loud enough to wake the proud owners of a Maytag all the way down the street.  I re-started Atkins on January 1 this year, and it's like going on speed for me.  I guess it is a compliment to the late Dr. Atkins - I tried Atkins once before and wasn't ready for a long term commitment, what with the glory of Christmas cookies and cheesecake and apple pie right around the corner.  But after my end-of-the-year overindulge, I once again took the Atkins oath.  And once again it is like I am on speed.  The absence of carbs seems to generate a tremendous amount of energy for me, so today it looked like a good day to wash evey bit of laundry in my house.    I started out by washing another casualty of an exploded diaper (see "Adventures in Poo...").  By the way, Mackenzie's nickname is Pooper.  Her dad and I believe that it is quite appropriate and indicative of her daily routine, as well as it may serve as a decent deterrent from the opposite sex later in life.  Whatever works, right?  So anyway, I put the little outfit in the washer.  Later on, when the cycle should be well over, I check on it to find that it is in fact stuck.  So I reset it.  It works fine.  Next, a load of jeans.  And I swear, I didn't stuff it - just a nice comfortable load.  Once again, I go to check and find it stuck midcycle.  I call the guy that sold us all of our Frigidaire appliances, as he has gotten to know us well with our quarterly inquiries about our existing warranties.  He tells me he's really sorry, and that they'll have someone out to fix it on Monday at 3.  Then I realize that thing is leaking, and I start crying (yes, crying) over the stupid amount of money we have spent on all these brand new appliances that seem to be doomed.  But I'm a survivor.  My husband left this morning for a trip to Vegas, so he's not here to be the usual target of my wrath.  It's got to go somewhere, so I decide I'm going to fix the thing myself.  James calls from the road and asks me if it really matters that I can't do laundry until Monday.  "No," I say, "But it's the principle."  Ah, yes, the principle.  I've never been a big fan of laundry and I am pretty well known for letting it pile up until forced to do it because everyone has run out of underwear. (Although this doesn't seem to bother the four-year-old.)  But since I'm on speed and every room in my house will be pristine by next Friday, I REALLLLLY wanted to get the laundry done.  Not caught up.  DONE.  Who-ho.  It really bothers me that it is never really DONE, which is why I put off doing it in the first place.    So anyway... I've spent hours staring at the glass window of my front-loading Frigidaire, waiting for a spin cycle that never comes.  I performed a miracle - I found the owners' manual.  I even got on-line and watched a tutorial on how to operate the thing in hopes of finding a clue as to its malady.  On to figuring out if the cycles are just not working. I try it empty, I try a few clothes. I try the long cycle, the short cycle and the delicate cycle. I try it with a fast final spin and a normal final spin. It doesn't HAVE a final spin, and it will fill up with water, and it is capable of draining water if the hose is pointed toward a bucket and maneuvered just so, but it won't apparently spin-cycle and drain on its own. And mostly I am mad at myself for spending four hours to learn absolutly nothing of value concerning the repair of my Frigidaire.

      I think you can don your heavily jeweled crown as a mother when you're cleaning poop out of the bathtub and you realize it's the first time the thing has been cleaned in like two months.  Then you rationalize that two baths a night (okay, okay let's say 5 nights out of seven - or sometimes it's one child but not the other) means that it's fairly clean anyway, right?  And then you pat yourself on the back for actually getting out the Comet and cleaning it,  not just wiping it down with the nearest damp washcloth and letting the shower run to rinse it down.  AND you realize the child hasn't had this sort of accident in like 8 months, so you must be doing SOMETHING right.    Not to cross the line between disgusting and funny,  I just have to tell you that I think my 4-year-old's slight accident tonight was some sort of bad karma (if I believed in karma) for the internal gut-busting laugh I had on Monday when I arrived at Tyler's (the 4-year-old) Tae Kwon Doe practice. (Yeah, I'm all for teaching violence as early as possible.- or it could be the discipline and respect part I'm after.)  I walked in and my husband said, "I hate you."  He then proceeded to explain that Mackenzie (the 11 month old) had a #2 that filled her diaper and overflowed all the way up her back.  And when a Dad describes consistency and odor in such detail, it is truly alarming.  He was trying to get the kids out the door and to practice on time, so he pretty much just wiped her down with an entire refill bag full of baby wipes.  And she's the world's worst wriggle-worm, so you can imagine the added stress in cleaning up the exploded diaper.    So I smiled at him, with just a little laugh.  And that's why he hates me - he knew inside I was rolling on the floor laughing, imagining him pinning her down at an arms length and trying not to puke while he changed her.  Hee Hee....  Moments a father should have more often because the Mom already knows too well what it's like.    He handed her to me, and she smelled horribly of baby wipes and baby poop.  When we got home, I gave her a bath.  After all, the tub was clean...

      Okay, so I took this quiz on on  urlLink beliefnet  from my sister-in-laws livejournal.  Though I don't need a quiz to tell me where I fall religiously, it is a fairly interesting little gimmick.   Choose the answer that most closely resembles the belief you have and viola! your labeled in a category as broad as the aisles in Wal-Mart.  I hope people aren't putting too much stock in this.  I agree with the number one category that I fall into, and I agree with the Biblical belief that God has given us fellowship with other believers as a core element of faith.  But fellowship and faith are not RELIGION.  My sister-in-law came back as a  Liberal Quaker.  (Huh?)  Ever read "The Case for Christ"?  Religion is why there is unrest in the Middle East.  Religion is an excuse for people to sleep in on Sunday morning and gripe about how so-and-so at church is such a hypocrit so why should I go?  Religion is misunderstanding of what the God that loves you wants out of your relationship with Him.  Yeah, I'm Southern Baptist and I fall in to that protestant "aisle", but you know what?  I found a church to belong to because God says that the church is his "body" here on earth and we each have a purpose in it, just as each part of the human body is given a specific function.  People are human and they let you down.  That's why you shouldn't get wrapped up in the lives of the people of the church you belong to but instead focus on God and get wrapped up in the part he has for you to play, in church and in the world.  Okay, so I understand I am ranting and raving... and probably opening up some healthy debate.  I say bring it on.  But don't bring it until you've read "The Case for Christ" and your Bible.

      Any doctor will tell you that an alarming number of pregnancies end in first trimester miscarriage.  It makes sense if you think about all the things that have to come together perfectly to form that little tiny life inside of a woman.  It's truly a miracle that it ever works at all.  When it doesn't, though, all of the knowledge and statistics in the world mean nothing.  I remember the day that I miscarried my first child as if it were yesterday.  I remember the grey sky, the drizzling rain, the smell of the air, the song on the car radio as my husband, James,  drove us home from the hospital.    It was October 5, 1997.  We had been married for three and a half months when I found out I was 6 weeks and 2 days pregnant.  We weren't ready for a baby yet, but the general consensus in the family was that you can never be ready for a baby, and that we would be just fine.   Exactly six days after I found out, I came home from work to find that I was spotting.  I called my mother who  at that time lived in a different state.  I called everyone I knew for some sort of reassurance that it didn't mean anything and that my baby was okay.  As I began to feel cramps, I knew it wasn't okay.  I think I had known from the first spot of blood that there wouldn't be  a baby to hold in eight months.  That night was a sleepless one.  My husband tried to comfort me, telling me "Don't worry, my son is going to be okay." Eventually the cramps became fairly painful, and the bleeding had worsened.   James took me to the emergency room.  I remember shivering in the hospital gown as the doctor on duty checked me out.  He wouldn't give me any definitive answers.  He said though my cervix was partially open, I may still be sustaining a pregnancy and recommended I go to my OB/GYN the next day for an ultrasound.  We arrived at the office early the next morning, and watching pregnant patients and new mothers enter an exit the office building just about killed me.  My doctor performed an ultrasound, and could not find a gestational sac.  Those moments were a blur for me, and all I can remember is how he spouted out statistics and said, "You're young... you can keep trying, you may even have another miscarriage.  Once you've had three, then we'll start testing you to see if there's a problem."  He was cold and short and I don't think I have ever hated another human being the way I hated that doctor at that moment.  The attending nurse hugged me tightly, and she was the first of many who would seem to come out of the woodwork with miscarriage stories.  She told me how her first ended much the same way and that sometimes when you are young, the first time your body just doesn't know what to do and  there's nothing you can do about it.  I felt helpless and damaged.  As someone who doesn't accept failure easily, I felt as though the loss of human life that I had carried for 7 short weeks and only known about for one was completely my fault.  Surely I had done something wrong.  I didn't drink enough orange juice... I shouldn't have continued to do my nightly light work out once I found out I was pregnant....  I had doomed the life inside of me by thinking that I wasn't ready yet... I could think of a million reasons why I was to blame.  James dropped me off at the house that day, where my friend Karen was waiting to keep me company.  She hugged me and pointed to the table where she had set up Monopoly.  She was about seven months pregnant herself, and though it pained me to think of her child-bearing success I was happy to have her with me.  I was upset that my husband was still required to go to work after such an event.  I knew that life had to go on and that the pain would lessen, but I longed to have him with me .  I thought to myself that he was probably happy to go to work so that he wouldn't have to be with a blubbering basketcase all day.  It was apparent that he didn't know what to say to me.  It wasn't apparent how he felt about the miscarriage until he walked through the door twenty minutes after he had left me with Karen.  He was with Rhonda, his twin sister, whom he works for.  She told me that he had walked into the office and said, "We lost the baby.", then burst into tears.  She cried right along with him and they both decided they needed to be with me.    After a while, the unexpected boughts of sadness subsided, and were eventually replaced with an irrational obsession with figuring out why it had happened.  Several women, aquaintances, friends and co-workers, had miscarriage stories to tell.  It is almost as if there is this club of women who have dealt with the loss of a pregnancy, but you don't even know about it until you confide in them that you have lost one of your own.  I was surprised that women with several children had experienced one or two miscarriages.  Some had trouble conceiving or had even lost a child in the second or third trimester.  I began to surf the internet for answers on early term miscarriages in perfectly healthy women with no family history of infertility or child bearing complications.  In chat rooms, I found women talking about progesterone levels.  The more research I did, the more I began to realize that doctors are not gods or miracle workers, and it was the first time in my life that I realized that I had to take charge of my own health care issues.    When I found out I was pregnant, it was confirmed in the doctors office with a urine test after I had taken a home test that showed a very slight positive a few days earlier.  I remember telling the doctor that I didn't feel pregnant.  They drew blood that day for the standard tests, and it wasn't until this past year that I would know the results of that test and how they could have changed my life.   In all my research, I learned that progesterone is the hormone needed to keep the uterus a friendly environment to a growing embryo or fetus.  It spikes each month in fertile days or throughout pregnancy and drops dramatically in the days before delivery.  The lessening of progesterone levels in a woman's system prompts the uterus to contract and expel either the monthly lining that has built up or the full-term baby in the form of labor.  If a woman's progesterone level at conception is not optimum, it is most likely that a miscarriage will occur unless she uses a progesterone supplement in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.  Some of the symptoms of low progesterone levels included longer monthly cycles or irregularity and absence of normal pregnancy symptoms, and difficulty conceiving.  The more I read about low progesterone, the more I knew that this was my complication.  I was still very young and had not thought to consult my doctor about my findings and inquire about the results of the blood test I had taken.  On July 23, 1998, I found out I was pregnant again.  Gripped with fear but armed with information, when the doctor's office confirmed the pregnancy, I asked to have a blood test immediatly and requested progesterone supplements.  My doctor seemed a little surprised by my request but seemed to humor me in light of my earlier miscarriage.  A week or so later his nurse called to tell me that my original progesterone levels were in fact "a little low", so I should continue the supplements and was to come in for an ultrasound just to confirm that everything was okay.  Even though I knew in my heart that this time would be different, I still had nightmares before that ultrasound that I would once again be presented with some sort of horrible news.  Instead, it was the ultimate best thing I have ever seen on a television - the healthy beating heart of my son.  At 7 weeks and two days gestation, his first picture resembled a peanut.  It had taken us ten months to conceive after my miscarriage.  the longer it took, the more I was convinced of the progesterone problem.  My thoughts were confirmed by that blood test,  but I shudder to think that if I had not taken the initiative to know about progesterone and its role in a pregnancy, I might have lost my son as well.  4 years later, in June of 2002, I received the good news once again.  And once again, I requested bloodwork and supplements.  Due to insurance issues, I had to change my OB/GYN provider during this pregnancy.  I was about three months pregnant when I received records from my original OB/GYN to transfer to the new office.  I came home with that folder and rifled through it like a madwoman.  My husband asked me what I was doing and made some comment about not knowing what anything in there meant and that you can't read doctors' handwriting anyway.   But I found it.  Three pieces of paper that didn't change anything but made a world of difference.  They were blood test results, and all of them had a column clearly marked "progesterone".  The one from 1997 was at 6.5.  6.5 what, I don't know.  But that was extremely low considering the test from July of 1998 was at 10.2 and the June 2003 one at 14.  On my next appointment, I asked the nurse midwife who would later deliver my daughter what the normal progesterone level should be.  She said something to the effect that they would treat anything under 12 at about 7 or 8 weeks of pregnancy.    Though nothing will bring the lost baby back, I know that that child existed for a reason.  That reason was for me to take control of my health and fertility and for me to pass on what I have learned about to other women who have gone through the same thing.  When you've lost a child early in pregnancy, people have a way of trying to comfort you by minimizing the loss.  They say you're young and have plenty of time to fill your house with children.  They say it happened for a reason, that the baby was imperfect in some genetic way and you're better off if it wasn't going to be  a healthy child.  Some believe that it is the loss of a pregnancy, not a  human life.  Whatever it is to you, you have to deal with it in your own way.  The perfectionist in me drove me to find the fault and correct it, and I thank God every day that I was able to do so.  For many women, the problem isn't so easy to solve.  It is discomforting to know, though, that many women have lost children to similar problems that could easily be prevented.  When I think back on the events of my miscarriage, I don't place blame anymore, but I often wonder if my child would not have been lost had my doctor listened to me a little more closely or raised an eyebrow at my slightly positive home test result. I look at my beautiful children every day and marvel at the miracle that they are.  Sometimes I wonder what my lost baby would've looked like, or I replay the event of my miscarriage in my mind.  If you've had a miscarriage, you know what I mean.  I don't dwell on the loss, but it is always with me.  I've joined the club.  Every once in a while, a friend or acquaintance will relay news of a miscarriage.  I feel their pain, and for  a moment, I feel mine all over again.  Then I tell my story so they can know that they are not alone, and that there is a future to hope for.

      Mackenzie woke up at her usual time this morning, in the usual manner - wailing in baby jargon about the injustice of being ignored while mom tries to sneak in five more minutes of sleep.  After several "snooze" episodes of the alarm clock and the definite unanswered prayer for Mackenzie to put herself back to sleep for half an hour, I realize I have lost the battle.  I roll out of bed and burst into her room with a smile and open arms, exclaiming, "Good morning, Princess Mackenzie!!"  She's such a drama queen, and she laughs in that patented 11-month old gurgle, smiles with all four of her front teeth beaming, and I know she's forgiven me for the 17 minutes she has been awake without parental entertainment.  The greatest invention in the world, even above the telephone and the internet (Oh!), are these cool saucer things that resemble baby walkers but they go no where.  The genious that invented them attached several gadgets and toys to the top of the saucer, and you put your baby right in the middle of it.  They can play and bounce, but they can't disappear down the hall in search of the nearest potential hazard.  Call it lazy parenting, but these things have CHANGED THE WORLD.  Once Mackenzie is awake and ready for action, the first thing she does is have a round in the bouncer.  So today, I put her in the bouncer and gave her the regulatory morning bottle, which has recently been favored as vanilla soymilk instead of formula. (A computed savings of like $30 a month - thanks, Mackenzie!)    As my world begins to get crazy with the impending work to be done this morning, the declared disaster of a house needing to be cleaned and a four-year-old that REFUSES to get ready to go to grandma's unless he can wear his new authentic Motocross get-up that Granpa got him for Christmas, I grab the nearest thing edible for Mackenzie.  Goldfish.  She loves those little orange cheezy goldfish.  So I set a handful down on her saucer's surface, and think briefly that maybe this constitutes eating while standing up, since technically she's not sitting down.  And I heard somewhere that eating while standing up just isn't good for you.  Not only that, I don't think I've ever seen anything endorsing goldfish as a "complete and balanced" breakfast. In fact, they may come dangerously close to being junk food. "At least I'm not feeding her a bottle of Coke and a bag of M&M's for breakfast", I think to myself. I smile because that sounds like a perfect breakfast to me and chock it up to reasons #2258 and #2259 of why I will not be receiving the Mother of the Year Award.   But you know, she's beautiful and healthy and happy to have goldfish for breakfast.

      I spent an hour and a half last night in an internal claustrophobic rage.  We took the girls (Miss Alamogordo and Miss Otero County) to the local MA Pageant for Silver City.  I won't even go into the painful program (or lack thereof), but right as the Lifestyle and Fitness (AKA Swimsuit) Competition began, Jorge Humungous sat in the seat next to me.  We're in an auditorium, so there is that unspoken rule of not crossing the armrest of the person next to you in the event that you don't know them.  Jorge was PAINFULLY unaware of the auditorium rules.  From the moment he sat down, he flopped his Letterman-jacket clad arms over into my personal space, making me excruciatingly nervous.  As if that wasn't rude enough, he was one of these guys that apparently must be so blessed that he can't stay within the seat boundaries with his legs either, so his left leg was also breaching my territory,  I had the notion to change the direction I had my legs crossed in and jam the heel of my shoe right in his calf.  But I'm nice, so I really just tried to ignore him.  You'd think the story ends there.  Uh-uh.  For almost 2 hours, while being deprived of precious personal space, I also had to smell him, too.  And all I could think of was that "Here's to You, Mr. Man Who Wears Too Much Cologne" commercial.  Isn't that a beer commercial?  Anyway, the emotional pain of last night's torture is only surpassed by the physical pain of giving birth.  Why can't people realize when they are invading someone's space?  I'm certain it was obvious how uncomfortable I was, and you would think a young man with that much need for room would find any of the other ample unoccupied seats without a neighbor to harass a better choice to watch a small town pageant.  Ugh.  The nerve of some people.

      I am impressed with my parenting skills tonight!!!  I actually was able to put some sort of method to the madness in this household and BOTH children were tucked in fast asleep by 9 pm!  That's happened a time or two before, but tonight, I feel like I made some headway with Tyler.  I've been feeling like he is the text-book example of a sleep-deprived child.  His normal routine is up at 9 am, play, play, play, fall asleep in the car somewhere around 6 pm (because he won't take a nap any earlier in the day), up at 8pm til about 2 am...  This is where the fifth member of our family butts in.  The VCR.  Mom and Dad can't take Tyler's restlesness, so his usual pattern leaves us bitter and defeated and all we can do is say "stay in your bed and watch this movie".  Yes, aweful, AWEFUL parents we are.  So it has become a number-one crusade of mine to get the kid to sleep at a decent hour, to get him to learn how to fall asleep on his own (no VCR, mom or dad), to not pee in his jammies, and to get up at a decent hour.  I know what you are thinking.  (All you need is a good routine!)  Yes, a good routine and some Benadryl.  (Just kidding, I would say only one night out of every six months do I actually contemplate drugging him.)    The first battle I have fought on this crusade is getting the hubby to play along.  Someone agrees a good routine will come in handy but doesn't like to join mommy in the ranks of bad guy, and therefore doesn't want to get tough about bedtime.  I'm at a little bit of a stale mate on this one, because I am being supported - but on nights when I'm gone, like I will be tomorrow, I know it will be Pirates of the Caribbean three times until I get home.  Yay.  Excuse me, Pirates are out (sorry Orlando) - and Spy Kids 3 is in (can't beat a pair of 3-D glasses).  Ah, to my point.  I have, in my very basic knowledge of child psychology, realized that too much change too soon will just backfire on me and I will lose faith that  I can do this .  So I have taken it one step at a time.  Last week, I focused on turning all the TV's in the house off at 8.  Then I read to both of the kids in Mackenzie's room for about 15 minutes.  We put her to bed (Thank God that she has so far learned a healthy sleep behavior pattern- she puts herself to sleep like a pro!) and then Tyler and I would go lay down in his room, no movie.  We did that three nights, and the other nights were kind of the same, he fell asleep to a movie.  Tonight, I put Mackenzie down, then me, daddy and Tyler all pile in Tyler's bed.  Daddy read a book and when it was over he left and it was "lights out".  Now last week, it took lots of fighting on my part to get Tyler to sleep without a movie.  Tonight, he asked once, tried to talk a little and then went right to sleep.  The other times it was still 10 or 11 before he was asleep, and I felt discouraged because even starting the routine at 8 pm didn't seem to help.  I was prepared for another long night of focusing my efforts on getting him to sleep, and was SOSOSOSOSOSO impressed that within 15 minutes, he was out.  So there is hope.  It's a slow process, but a worthy cause.  If only I could question where he gets his night-owl genes. (From me, the girl who happily blogs until 1am or works until 4am or occasionally just watches TV for the sake of not being able to sleep.  UGH.)  I hear it is in fact inherited, and ultimately if he is going to be night owl he can do it when there is no one else to blame his sleep deprivation on but himself.

      The debate could rage on forever about the right or wrong of homosexuality.  I can respect that and I can respect the side of that argues that people are born gay.  Wired that way.  It's genetics.  My answer to that is that there have been studies about serial killers and the most brutal of murderers that show that they, too, were "born that way".  That doesn't make their actions right and it certainly doesn't give them special rights as a minority group.  (Though I think a few Democrats could make a compelling case about it...)  And I'm straight.  Yes, born that way.  I am proud that the President I voted for is taking a stand, because to me, refusing to take a stand is a volitile way of life.  I saw interviews with people on the news in the last few days, and some of them are of the opinion "let other people do what they want as long as it doesn't affect me".  But they are ignorant because passing a law to recognize same sex marriages does affect them.  Already, I have thought about how I could possibly explain to my children that the government thinks it's okay for a man to marry a man or woman to marry a woman, but God doesn't.  Because, see, I may be a minority in my belief that God's view of marriage is the only few of marriage, and I have right to shelter my children from people who would teach otherwise.  Since we've taken God out of everything else, then gay people wishing to get married need to realize that God didn't sanction that.  Have we forgotten about Soddom and Gomorrah?  Has God not told us what becomes of societies that allow freely homosexuality?  Don't confuse my disagreement with intolerance.  I know a few gay people and I don't think by virtue of being gay that you've purchased a one-way ticket to hell.  God is also loving and forgiving, and one must only come to Him with faith that Jesus Christ died for our sins to be saved.  The second part of salvation is repentance.  And I think a gay person may realize that their lifestyle is not what God intended but they can know no other way, and in that light they should be respectful enough of God, the Christian religion, and Biblical teachings to not ask that their relationship be recognized by God and society as a marital union.  For the Bible says, "...in the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said  for this reason  a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."  And compellingly enough, in the same passage in (In Matthew 19), after being questioned about divorce, Jesus tells the disciples "...for some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven.  The one who can accept this should accept it."  Which I believe is telling us that you should only choose marriage of you can accept the laws of God that come with it.  Of course, we could go on and on...  I am fearful that a laisez-faire attitude toward gay marriage is like pulling th plug on the human race.    There is a specific NON BIBLICAL reason that man and woman exist, and that's also to keep the human race alive.  And though the nuclear family seems to be a thing of the past, I can't accept a couple of gay women to have children by some guy who's happy he'll never have to commit, or a couple of gay guys that convince their best friend to bear children they can raise without her.  I'm not saying these people are incapable parents, I'm just saying it's not right, it is not what God intended for us, and if one of my children grows up and announces homosexuality, I will love them all the same but I will never agree with the lifestyle.

      That poor guy from American Idol... How pathetic is it that the American public is having a cheap laugh at his expense over and over and over...and over again?  Something about this reminds me of those smelly kids that you picked on in the third grade.  Deep inside you felt bad for them, but your friends made fun of them and you didn't want to be an outcast so you laughed along with them.  Are we all in the third grade now?  Yeah, sure, it was funny when he was the highlight of one of the "You Suck" episodes of American Idol, but please, can we quit torturing this guy?  Did you see that news clip on Entertainment Tonight where they had him sing Elton John's "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"?  Let's put it this way - no tune and "vagabond" he pronounced "WAGABOND".  He can't help it.  His family probably came to America trying to live the American dream.  I don't think public humiliation is part of that.  Can somebody put a stop to this nonsense?

      I'm pretty proud of myself right now.  It's almost 3 am, and I have successfully pulled together some interesting information in a site I am building as a "Guide in Training" for About.com.  If you've read my previous blogs you may be wondering why in the world I would take on something like a new job that entails computer skills I have yet to learn.  My answer is two-fold.  1.  I have a grand plan.  If they accept me and my writing/web-publishing skills as a guide for About.com, I will have enough "invisible" income to go ahead and move into the office space I am so desprately coveting right now (more blog on that later...).  The pay may not be a whole lot, but it will be easier than trying to fit office space rent into my already-suffocated monthly budget.  And 2.  It's going to be a great way to be much more well informed about the business I am in.  Ignorance doesn't sell, and already in the small amounts of research I've done, I feel like I've climbed another rung on the business information ladder.  But you know, the time consuming thing is how to build things onto the website.  Somewhere in my clumsy publishing, I came across a "help" section that started tallking about widgets.  It didn't say what a widget was, though, and I feel like a dork asking my About.com mentor.  Wouldn't someone who applied for this job already  know  what a widget was?  Not me.  So if you are familiar with widgets, please pass your knowledge on to me.  It's late, and there is no doubt that I'll dream tonight about a small furry widget that hides somewhere n my computer and does things I don't know about.  Scary.

      I'm looking for a lobbyist to bring forth a bill to add a tax credit for people that are gullable enough to prepare their own taxes.  The tax credit would compensate me for the two years of lifespan that I lost last night while attempting to file online.    First, the anticipation of hitting that "DONE" button at the end is worse than waiting for pregnancy test results.  Thoughts of "Do I owe?  Can't be that much...  I'll be happy to break even...  What can I spend a refund on?... What if I get audited?... Estimating isn't lying, right??..." run rampant through your brain, causing a severe headache, sweaty palms and an increased pulse.  And that just made me light-headed because I had just finished working out. (See 135and28inches blog for reference.)  Seriously, I hadn't felt so anxious since the day I found out I WAS in fact pregnant with Mackenzie.  So you can imagine my near-heart attack when the nice little computer program told me I owed the IRS $1450.  Uh, yeah.  Right.  Convinced I made a serious error but it was not obvious, I compounded my stress in search of last year's tax return.  You never can find crap like that when you are looking for it.  Okay, I found it and returned to the dreaded computer.  Enter the 4-year-old that refuses to sleep, once again.  It's like 10:30.  Some of my frustration undoubtedly spilled on to him as I told him to do whatever he wants just leave me alone to finish this.  (I'm surprised I didn't find him later in the back yard riding his ATV in boxer shorts only.)  I compared 2002 to the information I was keying in, scouring both documents for differences.  After 20 minutes, there it was. A-DUH.  Double DUH.  The third question down asks if you have dependent exemptions.  I failed to check it, therefore the neat little program didn't ask me for the names and info on my kiddos.  And there's an extra one this year.  And if you fill that part out you get the nifty little child tax credit, too.  WOW.  So I go back, enter their info, and VIOLA!  They pop up on that first page.  I get back to that nasty little "DONE" button at the end and ask God to forgive me for actually praying that my dumb error makes a drastic difference.  God's pretty good at answering my prayers, because -button pushed- I'm now the proud recipient of a thousand dollar refund.  YEE-HA!  In my defense, the area of the online program I used that asked all the "situational" questions so you could fill out the right forms was vague in the area of dependent exemptions.  Let's cut the bull crap and in the future change that line to simply "If you have kids, and they are yours, check here."    And on that subject, let's add my proposed credit.  Next year I expect to see "If last year's return nearly killed you, check here."  And then I expect like an immediate $500 straight credit.  Do you think the IRS will agree????

      As I went through my day today, I was nagged by feelings of discomfort stemming from several recent events with church, family and co-workers alike.  Of course we can all feel the black-hole suction of an oncoming pity party, but I don't think that's what this is.  I think it is actually the opposite.  I realized, or actually "re-realized" a few things this week.  I love my mom.  She is my day care, and she was gone this week.  The task of taking care of the every whim of a 4 year old and a one year old isn't a mystery to me, of course, but the amount of things I am trying to do with my life comes to a screeeeeeching halt when day care ceases.  I asked myself over and over again this week why I didn't make the choice to be a stay at home mom.  Oh, yeah - I remember.  I wasn't given the choice...    And though I'd love to blame that on my husband, it can only be blamed on my incessant need to WANT everything.  I think I am borderline crazy and that I can't "settle" into anything.  James has worked for the same company for almost 12 years.  He's had promotions and is making a decent sum of money, but somewhere deep inside it drives me nuts that he never displays the selfish need to "find himself" or define his life goals.  It took me a few years of marriage to realize that his life goal is providing for his family, and I think just as I was not given the choice to be a stay at home mom, he has never been given the chance to explore what he'd like to do with his life because you can't raise a family on ambition alone.  But me, I'm crazy.  One minute I want to declare bankruptcy and stay at home and play with my kids all day, never having the need for pantyhose again.  The next I am planning out how I am going to make six figures this year and the amount of time I am willing to commit to it.  And since I'm my own boss, I find myself trailing the thought of unlimited income with how nice it would be to just show up and not have so much weight on these here shoulders.  And then there's the grand discovery... of course I want to write.  And be good at it.  Which could take a long time.  Because I am certain I break just about all of the grammar rules that exist, and I can't quite remember what a dangling participle is...  And the I come back to earth.  The most important thing that I realized this week is that my trials, my ambition, my drive to figure out what the perfect balance is - these things are key to my personality.  I'm concerned for a friend of mine who seems to be struggling with her job and with her relationships.  There are many excuses, and some very pertinent and valid roadblocks and extinuating circumstances.  Being someone who has already professed to be wishy-washy with my wants, I understand where she is.  And this week I came to the conclusion as well that it is somewhat taxing to be everyone's cheerleader all the time, including my own.  I think I am the person that I am because of the things that I want out of life.  My dad said from the time I could talk I had to have the last word and as much as that can be and is a bad quality, it can be good.  It means I'm determined, and that even though I may not know exactly what I want the big picture to look like I don't ever put down the brush and palette.  In fact, I'm probably finger painting.   This friend of mine has a mercy problem... she gives and gives and gives to everything and everyone in her life and she has not yet once since I have known her claimed anything for herself.  Claimed her place in our company.  Claimed her business as her own.  Claimed her right to a good relationship with a man that cares about her the way she deserves.  And worried.  She worries too much.  She recently broke up with her boyfriend, and she talked a little about blogging about it.  Instead she blogged about Queer Eye For the Straight Guy.  Which was amusing, yet not the peek into her soul that I really wanted her to write.  She does a great job professing her Democratic zest, but when it comes to putting herself out there for all us girl-pals to read... well.  That's her.  Hesitant to take a leap, resistant to voicing her innermost wants, shielding herself by not wanting to hurt anyone or speak her truths.      And I look at our Pastor, and I wonder how he has the strength to go to that church office day after day, facing opposition head on and very publicly.  How he can speak his truth- God's truth, too- and still have strength left to preach the two services on Sunday that are one of the deeply-buried roots of his turmoil.    Before my mom left this week, we had an argument, which is something we seldom do.  It was one of those arguments sparked by a long line of little things compounded with us both having long, bad days.  She told me that I'm wearing too many hats.  And I have to agree.  But on the other hand there isn't a single one I want to take off.  Wife and mother - that's obvious.  Can't just kill the husband and sell the kids, definitely wouldn't want to.  Servant- as in of God and at church.  My life falls apart when I don't include being active at church.  I would say there's a reason for that, and it has to do more with pleasing God than pleasing others.  Businesswoman - that's the touchy one.  The hat I'm wearing because I have to work, thankful to be blessed with such a wonderful opportunity but can also feel that this hat is the heaviest.  Because I have to wear this hat, I HAVE to succeed, to make it the best that I can.  It's not enough to just show up to work, it never has been for me, and that's how I got the job I have.  I often feel though, that if I didn't have to work I would have the perfect spotless house and would be a 100% ambitious mom, and both the kids would be reading War and Peace by now.  I also wear the peacemaker and the eternal optimist hats.  Though not occupations, I find myself in roles that force me to feel like I have to make everyone happy and like I am personally responsible for bringing light to situations or pointing out the silver lining.  If you include my desire to go back to school, my novel beginnings and throw in a few Miss Alamogordo/Miss Otero County traveling companion duties, I would say that sums up the things that fill my day.    I guess looking at that it is obvious why I feel like I never really get anything done.  And maybe I could have myself a little pity party about the stress of being me, but in reality, I love it.  I would give up the job in heartbeat if I could, to focus on family.  But since I can't, I have to be the best that I can at both, and I know that in the long run my family will benefit from my efforts on both fronts.  Maybe if I would quit blogging... duh.  I suppose airing out dirty laundry is in the air this week, for there certainly is a lot of that going down.  I wish I could fix things.  I wish I could keep my friend pumped up.  I wish I could shield the Pastor from hurtful people.  I wish I could feel balance between family and work every day.  And I wish I weren't afraid to write the next chapter of my novel.  This blog is my excuse for not working on THAT tonight.  UGH!

      I believe tonight I saw more mud being thrown around in a meeting than any Democrat could do with a 2-minute spot during the superbowl.  Where was I at?  Church, of course...  A business meeting at church this evening was the epic event in my day, and as usual will be the thought that keeps me awake for several hours beyond bedtime if I don't blog about it and let the frustration exit my body via my fingers...  That said, I  (a.) Think that senior citizens take advantage of the common person who somehow missed memorizing the Whoever's Laws of Public Meetings or whatever you want to call it.  Parliamentary procedure.  I would say that tonight's 3 hour meeting could've accomplished the same goals sans geriatric rambling about amending the motion before the board.... What?  Second the motion and move to amend the first motion and then discuss that and then move to motion to blah blah blah.... these church mentors basically want to vote on whether or not something should be voted on!  (b.) Hope that in my golden years my vision has not narrowed so much as to see only that I am offended when someone doesn't ask my permission for them to do their job.  You know, we pick leaders all the time, and I would venture to say that the church setting is probably one of the few where the leader's actions are scrutinized to the point of ineffectiveness.  I mean, come on.  He's the Pastor because he's qualified, Mr. X, Y and Z are not the Pastor, because THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED.  They cannot do his job anymore than he could step into their offices and run their businesses.  Their assumption that they have a RIGHT to know how he is running his "business" (of church) and that they get a say in every decision is as ridiculous as him showing up at their businesses and auditing their books to make sure they gave their whole 10% tithe.   There's a line to be drawn, and we pick leaders because someone has to lead, someone has to follow.  Apparently those that aren't following are just making a lot of noise.  (c.) Pray that we all get back to the point.  It's all about the Great Commission, and that IS the Pastor's job.  I won't question the manner in which he procedes to fulfill God's Commission for Christians, and though right now down to my core I want to leave the people in that church as far behind me as I can, I won't.  Because I know that the exact same people exist in other churches just with different names and faces.  I guess they call them the devil's advocate for a reason, and church wouldn't be the same without them.  Final thoughts on my night:  I'm exhausted.  I can only imagine what my Pastor and his family feels tonight.  They need all of the warm fuzzies projected towards them that they can get, so if you would be so inclined, please stop and say a little prayer.  Take it from me, he's on the right path.  If he wasn't, he wouldn't have such opposition, right? And I never believed more that God would answer prayers to comfort someone as I know He will answer for Charles and Brenda.

      In a desert land, much like ours, lived a flock of sheep.  Long ago, the land was fertile and there was a huge tree in the middle of it.  It was a tall, strong tree, and offered plenty of shade from the hot desert sun.  But now the tree was dead, and it though it offered little protection from the elements, the sheep that grew up in it's shade wouldn't leave it.  The master of the flock had, over the years, had to deal with countless obstacles in order to keep his flock healthy and growing.  The flock of sheep had become two separate groups - there were the ones that realized that the land was starving them and was not a good environment.  These sheep could see a greener pasture just on the other side of a fence at the edge of the land.  Of course, the fence was high, they could not scale it.  It was anchored in the ground, they could not go under it.  The second group were the sheep that would not leave their spots under the tree that once protected them.  They would not venture to see the land on the other side of the fence.  They would not look up and admit that their tree was dead and could protect them no longer.  The master, realizing the degree of danger that his flock was in, hired a new shepherd.  He explained to the shepherd:  "Go into my land and teach these sheep to follow you.  I have purchased the lush, green grazing pasture on the other side of the fence.  It is very important, though, that all of the sheep come together.  So listen to my instructions carefully.  There are sheep under the tree who might rather die than follow you.  There are other sheep who will trample over you to get to that land when they see you are tearing down the fence.  However, if you can not get them all to follow you, they will all surely die in that landscape.  You may not lead them to the other side until you can get all of them to go.  Not one will be left behind."    The next day the shepherd reported to the master that the entire flock was safe and sound on the other side of the fence, enjoying their new pasture.  The master was impressed with the shepherd, and said, "I have had shepherds for years try to move that flock from under that tree.  How is it that you accomplished in one day what they could not accomplish in several years?"  "That's easy," said the shepherd.  "I just cut down that big dead tree."  I think some of the people in our church are mad because their tree got cut down, and the shepherd didn't ask for permission from the sheep to chop it down.  Some people don't realize how difficult the task is that was given to the shepherd, that the entire flock had to come together before they could all enjoy the new land.  And the master's instructions were to bring them all - to leave not even one behind.  He never said 'don't touch the tree'.  He just commissioned the shepherd to bring them all, and he accomplished that task.  I believe, of course, that God is the Master, Pastor Charles is the shepherd, and obviously we all agreed to let him lead God's plan in our church- we voted for him unanimously.    How far worse would it be for the shepherd to take the easy route, cutting down the fence to let those that wanted to move on, and leave the others under the tree to die, if that was their will?  That, of course, is not his job and you are standing in the way of the Master's instruction if you expect the shepherd to ask the sheep for approval every time he changes the landscape to keep the flock alive.

      Nastygrams?  Love letters?  What would you do if you could leave a message to be delivered to a specified person only after your death?  Thanks to a whimsical visit to  urlLink Dave Barry's Blog , I found just the thing to  urlLink complete my life even after death .  This could even be better than the life insurance I attempt to sell.  At least insurance is more like a legacy, a chance to complete what the deceased started, or what they wished for their children and grandchildren.  This is just ridiculous.  I wish they'd show a sample of a letter left, or testimonies.  Just think of how many people must (a.) be dumb enough to purchase this and (b.) proving in the hereafter just what a coward they were in life.  Way to have people remember you!  I wonder if they let you change the heading for free, like if you originally left a love poem for wife #1, but married 7 times before you died.  It would downright suck for a bitter divorcee to receive a forgotten letter post-mortem, especially if the hubby had recently married a Swedish personal trainer young enough to be is granddaughter.  EEEeeewww, the potential.....

      This is the blog I've been avoiding for two days.  My daughter turned one this past Saturday, and it was quite the bittersweet event for me.  She arose cheerily as usual at about 8:30 a.m., and all day long as I looked at her, I struggled to burn into my memory the way she looked and the little things she did.  With Tyler, I was naive about the time that passed as he was a baby.  There are pictures all over the place of him when he was one, but I swear I barely remember it.  Unless some sort of divine intervention occurs, Mackenzie will always be the baby - what are the statistics again on women who get pregnant AFTER having their tubes tied?  Don't misunderstand, I don't really want or need and certainly can't afford another baby, but the passing of "the baby's" first birthday sure brought the biological clock feelings up again. Tick, tock.    Not only that, her birthday seemed to force me to really examine the blessings in my life and count them one by one.  There are so many things that I love about my family that I never really verbally recognize.  We spend so much time going through the motions of everyday life- the changing of diapers and taking out of trash, the making of beds and CONSTANTLY doing of laundry. (Ugh don't get me started.)  This weekend I really thanked God for all the little things - the way my daughter is always in a good mood in the morning, and the way the morning sun shines through her window and she smiles and giggles when I come in and pick her up.  Better then waking up to a Starbucks attached to my house every day.  For my son, who never just asks why.  It's always a thoughtful question to ponder, like "Tyler, look at the pretty full moon!", and he says "Yeah, mommy, is it in Albuquerque or Georgia?" and I have to enter into a deep discussion about satellites and space.  But it's never just "why?" and I love that about him.  For my daughter, who goes absolutely nuts for M&M's.  And if you try to eat them in front of her without sharing, she turns into a wild wailing beast.  For my son, who drew a picture of a treehouse that every adult that passes by can quickly mistake for male anatomy.  He delights in the giggles and the comments that his "tree house" gets, and he thinks it is a darn good drawing of one.  For my husband, who rocks and changes and sleeps with the kids, and even occasionally does the dishes without being nagged or bribed into it.  For his twin sister, who has become my sister over the years, the one thing my parents never gave me.  And for those parents of mine, who love us all and spoil their grandkids - for the grandpa that Mackenzie reaches for when he comes home, to dance with and then roll around on the floor, "wrestling" with Big Brother.  For the grandma that teaches letters and numbers and helps me clean my house when life is too hectic.  For the grandpa that inpires Tyler to ride a motorcycle and to clean and polish his Lil' Tykes ATV and to ALWAYS wear his helmet.  There are so many more, and the funny thing aout counting blessings is that you can't ever find a good place to stop.  All weekend long I had the Alabama song "Never Be One Again" in my mind, and as I counted my blessings, I also thought of the future.  I thought of how odd it is to be excited about watching your kids grow, wondering what kind of teenager they will be, who it is they'll fall in love with, what talent they will discover God has given them, and then in the same breath wish that they will NEVER be teenagers, they will NOT be allowed to date and how I'd do anything to keep them babies for just a moment longer.  I know  am a little biased, but my kids are beautiful.  They are both guaranteed to be the center of much attention from the oppposite sex, and part of me can't wait to see how they grow through relationships.  And the only thing I can do is pray constantly that they make good choices.  There's another song I thought of this weekend, called  urlLink "The Winner  by Coolio (its on the Space Jam soundtrack).  It presents many profound motivational thoughts in a rap context, but the line that sticks with me is "It all starts at home, once they're grown they gone and once they're on their own you got to leave them alone..."   I guess I have a few years before I have to leave them alone.  But I realize that day will come, and I know that no matter how many pictures we have, the memories of first birthdays and baby looks will fade as time takes its toll.  And when someone out there figures out how to slow down or turn back the clock, just pass that info on to me.

      Okay, my own Christian views aside - I think it is AWESOME that  urlLink Mel Gibson  is coming out with a movie that depicts Christ's torture and death.  Biblical reference also aside, it is about time that someone in Hollywood step up to the plate and show the other end of the spectrum.  When we live in a society that's used to bloody mulitple body counts, frivolous sex, gay relationships and marriages and acceptable drug abuse in any and every movie worth $7.50, it is sad that a proven true piece of history that happens to have significant  eternal consequences to many Christians such as myself is ignored or controversial based on the fact that Christ is in it. (Well, not Him, but you know, ABOUT Him)  Do people not realize that even the most stout atheist must admit that during Christ's time there was also murder, greed, corruption... all the key elements of a good movie which I am sure will be given their due weight in this one.  I guess what I am saying is funny how you could take a guy named George, tell a story about how he lived 2000 years ago and how he claimed outrageous things, was put to death after being betrayed by a friend, and after he died and aweful death, his ghost came back to haunt them, and that would be sheer entertainment, good story, interesting characters.  Call Him Christ, though, and everybody has a fit.  I think it's great.  I hope a lot of people go to see it and realize that 2000 years ago someone died for them, so that their life on this earth would only be temporary and pathetic considering what waits on the other side if they will just believe that He was (and is) who he says He was.  My Kudos to Mel...

      It's my son's 5th birthday today, and I can't believe how time flies.  Of course, he has to be the number one most spoiled kid because we not only took a trip to Disney "for his birthday", we are also celebrating today with cake and ice cream and going to Chuck-E-Cheese this weekend.  Whoa...  it reminds me of those really rich people who have month-long "event" weddings- this has been an "event" birthday for this little guy.  So anyway, Tyler was rattling off a list of things he STILL wants 'for his birthday'.  ("Tyler, you've gotten enough for your birthday!") So here's his list verbatim: "I would like a snowboarder, and a puppy and an army man with a backpack, AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, a squirrel."  Squirrel?????  I'm too busy trying to figure out how he got "and last but not least" in his vocabulary, no that its a bad thing.  He sounded so official.  It was too cute.

      Lawyers and people in my profession (insurance sales) have long been the butt of jokes that portray these occupations as... well... swindling?  Cheating?  No-good dirty rotten scoundrels just out to make a buck??  That's never bothered me, I know I help people with what I do.  But tonight I watched this new (can we PUH-lease put an end to this insanity????) reality show on MTV about "I want a famous face".  These twin brothers that were born (made by God) to look a little more like one of the cartoon figures on Rugrats, decided they wanted to look like Brad Pitt.  The following are the problems I have with this:  A.  How many cards short of a full deck does one have to be to look in a mirror and think that any amount of plastic surgery will bless them with a likeness of Brad Pitt, once the SEXIEST MAN IN AMERICA??????    B.  How do plastic surgeons go to sleep at night when their Rugrat clients come in and say "I want to look like Brad Pitt."  I mean, obviously, their doctor's reply was "Yeah, sure we can do that..."  Even my hairdresser cringes when you show her a picture of Jennifer Aniston or Madonna or whomever and say "Cut it like hers!!!"  In fact, a good hairdresser will say, "Honey, I can't work miracles."  And therein lies a big problem.  Hair is hair.  If Faith Hill's 'short do' on me looks more like Medusa with static, hey, its just hair, it'll grow back.  But plastic surgery???  And at like $10,000?  C'mon, guys - let's get a grip.  Be a good plastic surgeon and tell some people that flaws mean character.    C.  These guys looked the same after surgery.  Noses maybe a little straighter and not so Roman, but definitely not Brad Pitt.    D.  Did I mention Brad Pitt- Sexiest Man Alive???  I don't necessarily think so.  But wanting to look like him is definitely like me walking into a surgeon's office and expecting them to liposuck me into a size six and ask for a face like Nicole Kidman (someone I bear absolutely no natural resemblance to).    I'm sure sooner or later someone will invent some sort of "mask grafting" where you just buy someone else's face and have a surgeon overcharge you to sew it on to your head.  Until then, Brothers Grimm - you two wasted enough money pay off a few of my credit cards.    UGH... the inhumanity of it all.

      It's funny how a four-year-old learns geography.  We started our long trek back to Alamogordo today, and for those of you that haven't experienced it - driving through Texas is like watching the Twilight Zone in slow motion.  It creeps you out at night and seems like it will never end.    So we stopped just past the Arkansas border this afternoon for lunch, and Tyler spots the Wal-Mart (it's an amazing gift he has) and asks us where we are.  "Texarkana, " James says.  "Okay," Tyler answers.  Several (SEVERAL) miles down the road, Tyler starts talking about that Wal-Mart we should have went to in Tex-Ar-Canada.  The conversation went something like this:  Mom: "It's not Tex-Ar-Canada.  It's just Tex-ar-KANA."  Ty: "But then where is Texarcanada?"  Mom: "There's not a Texarcanada."  Ty:  "Then where were we, just then today?"  Mom:  "Texarkana."  Ty: "Arcanada?"  Dad: "She's just saying its name is 'TEXARKANA' not, 'TEXARCANADA'"  Tyler: "Oh."  Several (SEVERAL) miles later -  Tyler: "Dad, how come we didn't stop at that Wal Mart in Texas Arcanada?"  Hmmmmm..... Did I mention we are saving for therapy???

      We've been on vacation for a bit and I thought it was 'bout time to blog about it.  This is no doubt the most wonderful vacation I have been on in a while.  To understand that, you'd have to know about the last few vacations I took.  (((((((((((((((Flashback......)))))))))))))))))  Two years ago in the end of June, we went to Las Vegas with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.  Beyond the fact that it was like walking around on the freakin' sun, I was 12 weeks pregnant.  And due to miscommunication/poor planning, the last night we were in town, my husband and I were reduced to sleeping on the HARD floor of my father-in-law's hotel room. (Long-story-short:  we were supposed to be staying with a relative of my sis-in-laws, that turned out to be absentee.  It was the 3rd of July so soom rates skyrocketed and the coup decision was to stay with my father-in-law who also happened to be in Vegas on business.  Unfortunately, he only had a king bed in his room.  So his son (Robert) slept next to him, Vanessa slept on the only chair in the room, and James and I were left on the floor.)  Let's just say that between hormones and minor mishaps, that vacation was stressful.  We went to San Antonio last year around may, and it was a decent trip, although there was MUCH stress in getting lost and turned around on the mess of Texas freeways.  It, too, was like hanging out in a broiler.  It was also a pretty quick trip, sort of an anniversary surprise for me.  The most enjoyable thing was a really nice (ahem... and expensive) dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak House.  In November last year, we went back to Vegas.  This time, my father and mother-in-law had moved there and served as our hotel.  This somehow took the fun out of going "away" on vacation.  Not only that, but myself and my daughter spent the majority of the vacation being sick as dogs with that crazy flubug-on-steroids crap.  Now- all of these vacations had a particular spot of stress for me that was job related.  During all of them, I never 'quit working'.  I had my phone and my computer, and tried to stay on top of things and help clients that left messages.  I gave quotes, wrote policies, scheduled appointments, and called the home office several times while "on vacation".  By the grace of God alone, my business has been fairly successful and this year I decided to hire help while on vacation.  I had asked Amanda to work part-time for me as an appointment scheduler, and proposed to her a sum for the week and a half I would be gone if she would keep my phone and call my clients back each day.  This act alone has saved my vacation.  I admit, I have worked a little - read some email, checked a few on-line things... but for the FIRST timne since signing on with Horace Mann I have had a real vacation.  And what wonderful one it has been.  We went to Orlando and became genuine tourists- we took our kids to Disney's Animal Kingdom on Friday, the Magic Kingdom on Saturday and Universal Studios on Sunday.  Suffice it to say that if we don't go to another theme park in the next five years, my feelings won't be hurt.  We had a great time though -  No meltdowns, hangups or malfunctions.  No spewing, fit-throwing or embarassing displays.  And the kids were excellent, too!!!  For one split second we thought we lost Tyler, but he was just on the other side of a tree defacing a Mickey flower-bed.  Seriously - the weather was beautiful, the kids took our abuse willingly and without complaint, and we spent an obscene amount of money on food and souvenirs.    What I have really enjoyed most is seeing family that I haven't really seen in years- cousins that are all grown up now, aunts and uncles that are just like I remember them, grandparents that still hug you and make you feel like you're six years old again.  Everyone seems so successful and so... colorful .  I really was looking forward to this vacation anyway - and I was not let down.  I am so proud to be a part of our family, and have finally matured enough to see the real legacy that a family is.  I hope to somehow preserve as much as I can, passing it down to Tyler and Mackenzie.

      A few updates:  My washer was fixed under warranty with Frigidaire.  I have forgiven it of all it's transgressions.  My son is sleeping well by himself in his own bed every other night.  I say this because the normal routine has become Monday-sleep in bed and pee, Tuesday-mom washes bedding, Wednesday-mom remakes bed, Tyler sleeps in bed and pees. (Oddly enough he doesn't seem to wet the bed when he sleeps with us...bet Freud would love to analyze that.) Thursday- you get the picture.    My daughter has decided that instead of learning to walk, there is much more joy to be had in imitating a falling tree when a grown-up type stands you up on your feet.  It's cute, but I don't think it counts as progress.  My Pastor still has his job, and troublemakers aforementioned have found other churches to upheave.  Don't think it's over yet, after all it is deep-rooted in the eternal good vs. evil battle.  I saw "The Passion of the Christ", and there are no words... the closest I can come to describing it is saying that it reaffirmed my faith, emphasized my sinful nature, and magnified my gratitude for Salvation through Jesus Christ.  The dryer that was replaced with my Frigidaire dryer about a year ago was finally removed from my garage.  We intended to sell it, but never told anyone.  Wonder why there were no takers.  So in Sunday school a few weeks ago, I mentioned I had a dryer and of anyone knew someone who needed one, they could have it for free if they would just come get the stinkin' thing.  So someone finally did.  Yay!!!

      To Redheaded Muse:  Where you are in life right now is never as important as where you will be going.  Tomorrow, next year, and eternally.  I've always believed this and it comes with bittersweet realization.  If you know a better tomorrow awaits you, you will no doubt be restless and looking for a door to knock on.  Restlessness is a dangerous thing.  I know because I go there every Monday.  I want you to know something.  Your ability to affect people far outweighs your ability sell insurance.  (No offense.)  You have affected me in ways you'll never know.  Months ago, my eyes opened to the purpose that I'm meant for.  I admitted to myself that I have always known that I am supposed to be a writer.  It's something that my dad has told me since I could remember, but it did not become a reality until I prayed fervently about my purpose in this life.  Shortly after that, I recognized that my first course of action was to start writing again.  Something.  Anything.  It didn't matter if anyone would ever read it.  Then, in casual happenstance, you led me here, to this blog.  You affected the biggest change in my life to date - the one where I write.  Almost every day, from the heart, I am exercising what I hope will someday be my profession.    For years, I've had characters living inside of my head (not surprising, knowing me, huh) just dying to have me pour out their lives on paper.  You helped me realize that I could do that.  The fact that you read my blog inspires me, because if anything I write strikes a chord in your heart, then I am where I need to be - right?  I'll consider you my first fan, and dedicate all of my books to you.  Back to my point.  (Yes, there is one.) I know you're searching.  And frustrated.  I can relate.  If your calling is to affect others, than what seems like a career choice is really only a one-right-answer question.  Paycut?  Yeah, well, enough has been said about life on commission.  Personally I think the only choice you have to make is whether you want to give this job your all realizing the potential to help, or do you want to focus your efforts on the little people in that classroom.  Either one presents plenty of situations for you to spread around mercy.  I think you are at the point where I was months ago - ready to admit what you are, what you are made of - but afraid that admitting it and surrendering to that purpose will lead you down a path you're not sure you're ready for.  My advice, take it or leave it, is to jump on that path with everything you've got.  And we'll share our journey of getting to the better days ahead.

      I've been catching up on many other things since returning from my business trip to Phoenix last week.  So having just finished the dishes (which were few considering my husband did the  unthinkable  and cleaned my house from top to bottom while I was gone) and decided to sit and put a few thoughts together.  The first is that I seriously thought my plane was not going to make it home.  It was wobbly taking off and continued to bump, thump and grunt all the way home to El Paso.  It may have been my imagination, but I could've swore I saw the fusilage constricting and shifting in the wind.  UHhhh.... SCARY!!!!!    The meeting in Phoenix (I think technically we were in Tempe) was one of the best uses of meeting time I have had with Horace Mann.  I think it is second to the Ameritas training course I went to in Lincoln, Nebraska a few years ago.  There are those meetings that, for whatever reason, seem like a bad dream that you can't wake up from.  And then there are the ones that have immeasurable value, where you meet people and get ideas that will help you in your own success.    It's not really a wonder that the people at this meeting seemed full of wisdom and good ideas, they are for the most part our company's top producers.  I was the only agent in the state of NM that was chosen to attend, which might sound special but truly there are only like ten agents and almost all of them are newer than me.  So I got there by default, if you will.  Anyway, the point of the meeting was a rollout of new software that stands to shift Horace Mann from an order-taking insurance agency into a full-fledged financial planning necessity for teachers.  As usual at Horace Mann meetings, I tried to grow out of my shell a little and meet new people.  With this group, the more I got to know them, the more intimidated I was.  They were all wonderful people, but it just seemed like their agencies and their business numbers are just light-years ahead of mine.  I'm a little stubborn, though, so the intimidation is feeding a healthy competition in my work ethic to  be better .  Work harder.  Whatever it takes.  Along with my new burning desire to succeed and my lack of current excuses not to, I have done much pondering about God's plan for the people that come into and out of our lives.  I started thinking about all of the people I have met in my life that left a mark, for better or for worse, but I would not be the person I am without that mark.  Growing up as a military brat really conditioned me to 'make friends as I go', I guess.  I thought about Heather, my first true best friend and how we lost contact somewhere around the 7th grade but I can still see us playing in her yard in Germany, and I can remember what her handwriting looked like when we were pen pals for countless years before more moves for both of us left us lost.    I think about Jennifer a lot, who is still a person of great influence in my life, and has been since the 5th grade.  We never lost contact, and I don't think we ever will.  She's always there in the background of my head with the silly "Wind Beneath My Wings" theme song from beaches illustrating the sisterly love that binds us for life.    And there are so many more.  There was Corey, my first boyfriend who loved me then hated me then loved me again.  And then hated me.  But I think when I left Italy he loved me again.  He was a mess.  He's probably dead or in jail by now.    And then there's the EX, who's name shall not even be mentioned, who for lack of a better explanation was that 'first love' experience that you just HAVE to get out of the way so you can figure out for yourself what true, real love is.   I pulled my scrap book out from when I was at the University of Florida last night.  I had made such good friends with a handful of people there, and as I said - I don't know where they are today - they left their mark.  There was Jon, James (James 2, as we referred to him to distinguish him from my then fiance, James), Jeff, Jackie, Katrina and Leanna.  James and Jon are electrical engineers somewhere, I'm sure - James is probably in a relationship with a needy female, Jeff is probably making lots of money and still dating, that is unless he finally got back together with Jackie, who was his regretful ex-girlfriend.  Katrina probably flunked out of school as she was on academic probation when I left and about an inch away from jail for writing bad checks.  We should take a moment to pray for her....  Jon... Jon looked like the guy from Will and Grace that is a flaming homosexual and was always equally as funny (without being quite so 'gay').  Leanna's probably in Dallas raising a family and working, as she and I were a lot alike and that's where she was from.  There's a lot more people I could talk about, but memory lane is no doubt entertaining only to those who built the road.  What is my point?  Hmm... a point.  Let's see if I can get to it.  People come and go.  They loved you when you didn't love them back, and when you loved them, they didn't love you.  They were the girls you loved to hate that became your best friends, or the girls that no one liked that became your closest confidantes.  As we go along in life we get to choose who is actually a part of our lives and who we will allow to leave only their marks, and let them go.  The best people we come in contact with are the ones that make us appreciate our choices in life, make us realize the equity we have in our already-built relationships, and the memory of them is happy even if it is fleeting.  These people - the great ones - often blow into and out of our lives like fall winds blow the leaves...    And whether you're on a plane that seems like it's going to be blown straight into the ground at any moment or just going about your daily things- it's good to appreciate everything you have, and to realize that there will be people here and there that will come into your life and rearrange just a little bit of you - but always hopefully for the better.

      Whew... here's reason #867 why I don't qualify for the "Mom of the Year" award.  As you may know, I've been saving up for future therapy for Tyler in conjunction with his college fund.  He'll  really  need it now.  Our local animal shelter has a fostering program in which you can take an animal home "for trial".  In some serious lapse of good judgement yesterday, James and I went to look for a puppy that would fit into our household.  We were looking for one that would turn out to be sort of small as our last domestic pet was supposed to be a Labrador Retriever but was in fact a HORSE.  Tyler was scared of him and Mackenzie was an infant and needless to say, even if we owned several of the back yards on our street, it wouldn't have been enough for the Lab on Steroids.  Not to mention no one was having fun picking up dog-horse droppings.  Before that (several years ago), we purchased a Dalmation from a guy who was leaving to go overseas.  We named him Magic, after basketball great Magic Johnson.  Which was appropriate considering this dog could scale anything - cinderblock, chainlink, barbed wire - and the electric fence didn't even phase him.  So after receiving a citation on my door one summer afternoon for "Dalmation at Large- chasing cars - pick canine up at the pound within three days..." (No we did not AT THAT TIME  consider leaving him there...) we gave him to a teenage kid who could hopefully give him whatever it was that we weren't that lead him to escape our 'compound'  daily .    What were we thinking yesterday?  I don't know.  I think my judgement was altered due to forced lack of caffeine.  We explained to Tyler that we were just trying it out, to see if we were ready to handle another family member.  The puppy whined all night long unless I held him, and though it was cute, sometime around 4am, I really regretted the 'let's surprise the kid with a puppy' decision.  By the time James got home from work, I had made up my mind that we weren't ready yet.  We took the little guy back today.  I feel like the BIGGEST LOSER MOM EVER.  Tyler seems to understand, and I explained several times that his behavior tells me that he's not ready for a dog (we explained to him yesterday that he would have to help - pick up his toys, feed the dog, take him outside, etc.).  After  a few hours yesterday, the luster wore off and Tyler didn't want to do any of the 'work' associated with having a pet.  He really didn't become too attached, and even suggested last night when the puppy was crying incessantly that he missed his brothers and sisters and that we should take him back.  All of this notwithstanding, I feel like a heel!  Who does that?  Who get their kids a dog and takes it back the next day???  James was all for the decision, and I know it is best in the long run.  We did promise Tyler we would keep looking for a puppy - the perfect one - and to "bribe" him, we took him to the fish store and bought him a soft-shell turtle for the pond he and Grandpa just built.  He seemed quite intrigued that we had to buy little feeder goldfish, and was a little morbid on the way to grandpa's house, telling the fishies that the turtle (which by the way resembles a burnt pancake with legs and a snout; very strange) was going to eat them.  He seems okay and I know he'll forget all about it.  That is until his therapist hypnotizes him and brings out that all his troubles are because mom brought home a puppy and took it back the next day.  Yikes.

      I just had to add that on Sunday, we sang a song in childrens church called "Trading My Sorrows".  It's an upbeat song and the course has a line that goes "Yes, Lord, Yes, Lord, yes, yes, Lord..."  I caught Tyler singing it while we are at luch after church.  Except he was singing, "yes, no, yes, no, yes, yes, no..."  Sometimes I wonder how much we unknowingly confuse our children with fuzzy semantics.

      On the outside my church seems healthy.  Happy.  Growing.  I had 21 children in grades 1-4 children's church last Sunday.  Debbie had around 15 or 18 preschoolers in her class.  That's the most children I can recall ever seeing in church in the last 5 or 6 years.  Oh, but haven't you heard?  Our Pastor, Pastor Charles Hanks - he's doing it all wrong.    Just when I thought that all had quieted down and maybe the mayhem had left the building, I went to my small group ( another 'horrible' idea ) only to find that yet again we find ourselves int he midst of a business meeting-turned-vendetta against the pastor.  I am once again appalled at the mentors in our church and their mentality.  But - I did some thinking and I know what they want.  They want a pretty pastor to stand up there and say what they want, and do what they want.  (Not that Charles isn't 'pretty', per se.)  The want a puppet, or a Muppet.  And from what I hear about how some members dislike the services, I've come to think they'd rather have a dead guy standing up there at the alter.  AH!  But they have missed the point, you see.  Because someone did die, and though He's not standing at the alter preaching to us Himself, He cared enough to send the very best.  I believe that is what Charles is - and Charles is there as a teacher, a man of God with a heart for God.  He's building an army in our church and I guess that means making allies and making enemies.  I know which I side I want to be on when I answer to God. And those who cannot see this reality are blind because the devil is standing behind them with his very claws over their eyes, encouraging them to take their best shot at the Pastor as if he were a pinata.  The human part of me steams at the thought of people that miss the point.  But my soul knows that evil grows only because Charles and Brian and Jesse and Jim are a threat.  Apparently a BIG threat.  My prayers are that evil will not prevail, that the pain caused to these individuals as if they weren't even human be taken away by the loving God they are working so hard for.    No one should have to put up with the treatment that a few members seem to feel is their right to inflict as a member of this church.  It's these people, the people that are being blinded by evil in the form of political agendas and power struggles, that we need to pray for the most.  Because, you see, they are missing the point.

      There are those days when I feel like I  can  do it all, and very well at that.  Today was one of those days.    My kids were both up and dressed by 8:30 and at grandmas by 8:45.  This is quite the accomplishment because usually when they do get to grandma's that early, they aren't dressed yet.  I would say that this is from the pure joy that grandma gets out of dressing them, but really it's due to poor mommy planning on my part, usually.  Anyway, they were both dressed! - and out the door before 9am.    Then, I did my usual - took care of about 30 people's insurance needs in the next 4 or 5 hours.  Yay!  I actually got CAUGHT up on my workload, which is a huge center of accomplishment for me.  I was forced to do it, though, because I am moving into a new office and I VOWED to not move in my current state of catastrophic chaos.  So, it was done.  By 3 pm I had moved everything business-related out of my house and into my office by myself with a throbbing lack-of-caffeine headache, purchased a new desk for my office, convinced my overworked and tired husband to join me (yeah right) in building it at my office,  and went grocery shopping.  After the damage was done at Wal-Mart, I helped a five year-old load a cap-gun while unloading groceries and put a one-year-old to bed.  I think sitting down to write this is the first 'break' I've had all day - and it's 1am!!!!  And I am still semi-coherent!  It's days like these that really make me smile, and even laugh a little, because I feel like I accomplished SO much, but then I look around at 5 or 6 piles of laundry I need to do, at the day-old Mackenzie-rejected food stuck to the kitchen floor, and I wrinkle my nose at the strange smell coming from Tyler's bathroom and think about where I should start tomorrow.    SuperMom's work is truly never done.  And SuperMom's kryptonite must be bleach 'cause she's a lousy housekeeper.

      I had to call the cops today.  For the DUMBEST reason possible.  Okay, follow me here.  Me and Mackenzie dropped Tyler and James off at Tae Kwon Doe.  James had been driving, and his keys were in the ignition (he did not take them with him).  Mackenzie was fussy and I had given her my keys before I took over the wheel.  I was supposed to be running home to get something and then coming back to pick up Tyler and James.  When I got home, I pulled in the garage and left the car running, a/c on, and I was only going to be a second.  As I was coming back to the Tahoe, I hear a familiar short beep of the horn several times and think to myself "awe, she found the lock button on the keys!"  A DUH!  She locked herself in with my keys, the only other existing set in the running ignition!    Now, if you want to get the police to your house in a hurry, call and report a baby locked in your car.  They were there in a jiffy!  Of course, I was considerate and called the non-emergency line and explained that she was okay and in the shade with the a/c on, but they still came a-runnin'.  There was a locksmith right behind the officer and he popped the lock and didn't even charge me.  He said, "kids are free!"... which was  a great relief considering my humiliation and self-inflicted bad-parent complex attack.  The funny thing was, the 10 minutes or less that she was locked in the car, she thought it was hilarious.  When the officer arrived, he peeked in at her and she smile real big.  He reported back to the station that "the baby is 10-4".  I thought that was cute.  What's the 10-code for spoiled rotten????

      All of my life I have had what I have recently identified as PVCs (Premature Ventricular Contractions) in my heart.  They make it feel as if your heart does a flip-flop in your chest.  There have been a few times in my life where I have experienced these in a more disturbing manner than others - the last few weeks, for example.  When at their worst, they seem to give way to mild panic attacks (after all, feeling like your heart is going to explode does give you a sense of "impending doom" - which is a clinical 'symptom' of a panic attack.  "Impending Doom!" - Like there should be a good low orchestral starting and a shadow of a man in a robe with a sickle behind you) and those seem to perpetuate the PVCs, or palpitations, as I have always refered to them.  Interestingly enough, I went to go see a doctor about this.  While I was waiting, a woman from church (whom I didn't know worked there) saw me in the lobby and came to speak to me.  If you've been keeping up with my blog, you know that I don't believe in coincidences and that God routinely sends ordinary people to comfort and save us every day.  This lady's name was Madeleine, and I have my fair share of reserved opinions about her.  Regardless, she took the time to ask me what I was there for.  When I explained to her what I was feeling, she mentioned a few things that made sense.  Like that anything from hormonal imbalances to vitamin supplements can cause these heart weirdnesses and panic attacks.  We had a good conversation about the fragility of a woman's hormonal system and how anything out of whack can lead to depression, panic attacks, sleeplessness and the like.  I can't remember everything she said, but I know that in a moment when I really needed someone to tell me they understood, she was there.  After my visit with the Dr., I was further assured that my heart seems to be healthy, but was further recommended to a cardiologist to rule out any major problems.  After making the appointment (for next Monday) I looked up everything I could on the net about my problem.  I was comforted to see that LOTS of people have these things, that they are usually benign, and that LOTS of people seem to have them more severely than I do.  Some people posted on heart health boards that they experience these flip-flops of the heart with every other heart beat or every third heart beat for days or weeks in a row.  I can't even imagine how tiring and consuming that must be.  A common thread seems to run through - I noticed a lot of the people with symptoms either are very active (or atheletes), and/or they have been treated for or have problems with hormones and/or depression.  I don't consider myself very active, but I do know that I have low progesterone.    I don't need a PhD to know that I have a very good clue about what makes this happen in me.  After I visit the cardiologist, who will most likely recommend that I wear a monitor to record the events, I will be calling my OB/GYN to do a full workup of my hormones and thyroid.  After that, if it's just stress, I guess I'll learn how to deal.  My point is, when these 'attacks' happen, it is so hard to feel normal.  It's like I am teeter-tottering on the edge of insanity, and as much as I try to talk myself into normalcy, the panic feeling still exists.  I know that the panic attacks are most likely seperate from the PVCs, and most likely caused by my reaction to having more than a few PVC's in a day's time.  As with everything else in life, I've lifted this up to God - praying for relief and to stay sane when it feels like my sanity is beyond my reach.  Also, after speaking with Madeleine, I quit taking the vitamin supplements I was taking.  In the last three days, the palpitations have lessened quite a bit.  I did have a mild panick attack last night, but I'm hoping that was related to the 'decompressing' from being wound up so tight about these things all week.  It was more like I knew that if I would just go to sleep, everything would feel better in the morning.  And it did.

      I care what you think!  Not about me or your job or the current president... but I do care what you think about you and your blogging intentions.    So you go girl.  Let it all hang out.  Who care who reads it?  Who cares who cares?  Those of us that truly love you know what to take from it.  I have to say though, as a die-hard Republican... are you implying that the Clinton Administration had NO play whatsoever in the anti-terrorism actions in question?  That idiot doing the questioning couldn't even remember that he was talking to Condeleesa Rice.  PUH-lease.  I think your caffeine intake may be affecting your political views.  :)   I love you anyway.

      I've stewed about this blog for 24 hours, now.  Because I'm afraid my rambling about reality shows borders on obsessive/compulsive.  Obviously I'm watching them.  And then ranting and raving about them.  Which makes me no better than the people that truly ARE entertained by the sickening phenomenon of reality TV.  The show in question:  THE SWAN.  Is it me, or is it like a really big secret that a woman's self-confidence palys the biggest role in bringing out her beauty?  If you were not unfortunate enough to have your life taken over for one hour last night by this train-wreck of a t.v. show, let me fill you in.  Two women.  Not ugly nor fat by normal (if normal existed) standards.  "Average", they call themselves.  Neither of them in need of plastic surgery.  Both of them in definite need of serious confidence-building relationships.  One was married, the other had a boyfriend.  So it's not like either was a desperate hag looking for a date.  Here's the clencher.  They both had EXTENSIVE plastic surgery, dental work, grueling physical work outs and diets and ("ahem") counseling for three months.  At the end of the three months, some obscure panel of judges gets to choose one to continue on to compete in "The Swan" pageant.  Okay, so we are going to take two women who are already on a fast-track path to self destruction, tell them both that just by changing what they look like on the outside we are going to solve ALL of their problems ("... All I want is WORLD PEACE.")  A nip here, tuck there, and after it all, we're still going to give one of you the boot.  Ce' La Vie.  Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.    How wrong is this?  How detrimental to society is it that we are going to PROFIT from women who undoubtedly are familiar with Prozac already?  Because how unstable and self-hating would you have to be to even be interested in signing up for this kind of self-torture?  How socially irresponsible!!!!  (You can actually see the steam coming from my ears, can't you?)  Somebody should start a reality TV boycott.  Maybe it should be me.  But then again, Friends is ending and there's nothing else to watch on TV.  UGH.

      I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO happy!!!  I finally was able to take the next step in growing a business... I signed a one-year lease on an office space yesterday.  As soon as the deal was done, a huge weight came off of my shoulders.  For almost three years now I've been in a constant inner struggle that has just about made me crazy.  It's hard to explain to someone whose livelihood has never involved working at your own pace, on your own hours, in your own home.  And even though all of these things are true advantages, there is  a certain amount of stress involved when there is no one around to tell you that you may lose your job over the two hours you waste several days a week watching reruns of Dawson's Creek when you should be out selling SELLING selling!!!  Very often my rationale would include that I'm doing just fine and more often than not I stay up until the wee hours of the morning doing paperwork or filing.  NOW, I wll have no excuses.  I get to keep the freedom, but can also make my life a little more normal by actually having "business hours".  Instead of feeling obligated to work because my computer and all of my work is in my "home office", I can now work like normal people do.  I'm really looking forward to this change, and my husband's support for it really makes it even that much more exciting.  (It's taken a few good arguments for my wonderful spouse to come around to the notion that I have a REAL job, even though I am home a lot or can do what I want with my day.)  SO....  In praise of my God that blesses me more than I deserve on a daily basis...  Because really and truly all that's happening here is that my prayers are being answered faithfully by Him.  I wouldn't attribute too much of the success I have had in the last three years to my own efforts.  The right people and the right situations seem to enter my life at the right moment all the time, and this is more than mere coincidence.  On the spiritual thanks note, a friend and colleague of mine was recently baptized in the Christian faith.  I think she was baptized as a child, but has recently gone through struggles and has made new commitments in her life.  This is the single most important event in our lives, because it takes care of eternity for us. (The becoming saved part, for which baptism is a public proclaimation that you've made the choice to live your life for Him, instead of for you.) For her, if you are the praying kind (I know my readers are growing!!! ) please keep her in your prayers.

      Every once in a while you hear a song that just fits your life like your most comfortable old sweatshirt.  This one's from Kenny Chesney, and I like it particularly because if you read the album jacket, you'll find the song is talking about a full-time mom, not a career-woman.  Just that one job alone can be so overwhelming...  throw in an actual part-time or 9-5 and you really know what the woman in this song feels like!  BUT... all in all it's about getting everything you want in life and still remembering to stop and let the person you love uncomplicate it for you every once in a while.  So to my husband... who says just the right thing more often than he knows...  Woman With You  She hit the door 6:55,  sack full of groceries split down the side. Canned goods scattered all the way to the curb, Look on her face saying 'don't say a word'. So, it's me and her and a can of beans, sitting there on the front porch swing. Western sky all turning red, Head on my shoulder, she sighed and said:  Been go-for'n, chaufferin', company chairman, Coffee maker, Copy repairman, Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear, man, that I don't do. Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals, Dancing backwards in high heels- Just when it feels like I can't make it through. She said 'it sure is nice  to just be the woman with you'.  She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me. I was gonna run the bank, I was gonna run the mile, Now all I want to run is a bubble bath. Back then you know I had this plan, Before all of this reality set in. Here comes life, boy, ready or not, Hey, I wanted it all and that's what I got-  Been go-for'n, chaufferin', company chairman, Coffee maker, Copy repairman, Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear, man, that I don't do. Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals, Dancing backwards in high heels- Just when it feels like I can't make it through. She said 'it sure is nice  to just be the woman with you'

      You know, sometimes the days you dread the most turn out to be the best.  I stressed in my last blog about Thursday, and here's how it turned out.  I got to see a beautiful sunrise as I drove over the mountains to Hobbs.  Which is unusual for me becuase I'm not a "sunrise" kind of person - I'm usually still asleep.  My client was really nice, and there was a misunderstanding.  She's interested still in the deal and now I don't feel so nervous about it because I gave it my best shot.  As they say, the ball is now in her court, and I'm not so stressed over it knowing that I presented what I could.  That's all I can do.    Then, my next three appointments were in Carlsbad and all of them were the   nicest  people.  That's got to be one of the best brightest spots of my job, getting to meet some really incredible people along the way.     Then, my drive home was uneventful, which is good.  It's never an interesting thing to see Bambi grazing on the shoulder out of the corner of your eye or react with a jerk when Thumper crosses the road.  It's a long way to go, as it usually is.  But it was well worth it...

      I need to quit my dayjob.  I was just sitting here thinking.  I have a huge case to sell tomorrow, and I hate that I have pinned so much hope to it.  It's only natural when something big comes your way to think about the possibilities and the financial ramifications it has in your life.  It is, in fact, impossible to think about just the benefits the client receives.  And I hate that.  I hate that I have prayed about it, and as much as I have prayed that only God's will be done in the situation, some small part of me is thinking of the bargain - 'if only this goes through - I'll do this, I'll do that...'  And all I was thinking tonight is how this isn't me.  I don't want to sell insurance.  I want to sell books - by virtue of people liking what I write and who I am and the characters that I'll live through in black and white.  I hate thinking- knowing- that if tomorrow's deal closes, I'll be that much closer to being out of debt and that much closer to creating a financial situation where I can take more risks as a full-time writer, and reap more rewards as a full-time mother.  Maybe it sounds lazy, I don't really care.  I want to be home with my kids.  I don't want to feel like I need a maid to keep up with my housekeeping.  But I don't want to pin my hopes and dreams to clients and the decisions they make.  I don't LIKE my job.  I like the flexibility of it, the perks, the  way  I work, but who am I kidding?  I like to think I help people, and I believe that in most instances I do, but it's not the kind of help that truly makes a difference in a person's life.  I can show people how to save for retirement, but if they didn't I can't bail them out and promise them they won't have to be a greeter at Wal-Mart until they die.  I can talk about products and services and coverages in my sleep, but I can't save people from being crippled in accidents or from having to deal with the aweful evil that is claims adjusting.  Maybe it's a little melodramatic.  I should be thankful that I have a job that offers opportunities to make large sums of money should a client decide they want to go ahead with something.  But people who can walk away at the end of the day and shut the door in their brain until tomorrow are perhaps a little more blessed in terms of work-related stress.  I wish I'd just win the lottery... but I suppose for that to happen I'd need to buy a ticket.

      This is my first fictional blog entry.  It was inspired by a visit to my great-grandfather when we were home for vacation in March.  I want to expand it and send it to a literary magazine,  urlLink Glimmer Train Press , at the end of the summer when they are accepting new stories for standard submission from new writers.  Your comments are welcome and appreciated.   Dear Warden:  You stand there at the end of the hall, staring at me tirelessly.  Judging me.  Sizing me up.  Your quiet stare antagonizes my fighting nature, wakes up the rabid Rottweiler that lies quietly sleeping in the hearts of all good men.  My blood begins to boil and once again, I find this pen my only means of communication to you.  I'm innocent.  I've told you before, and I'll tell you again.  I did nothing to deserve these walls or this constant vigil over me.    Innocent?  I can hear your laughter.  And I want to yell at you - I want to scream, "I want my life back!" at the top of my lungs.  But my voice doesn't cooperate, and it would be a futile effort.  You must have learned in your experience to react to nothing a prisoner says or does.  After all a reaction would mean that there's a connection, a human connection between me and you.  And connection means emotion, and a man of your stature is no doubt denied the luxury of emotion.  I'm pleading for my life, dear Sir.  My wife comes to visit me here, and I can no longer bear the tears that glisten on her cheeks.  She says we'll be together again soon, and she waits.  That's my Dot - she always was like that one little patch of bright green grass that breaks through the toughest asphalt man can lay down on a lonely desert road.  No matter how many layers of tar they heap up on it, no matter how hot the days are or how frigid the nights are, that one little tuft of grass always breaks through.  That's my wife.  We made it through some tough times.  And she doesn't complain, not even a little.    I look down at my hands as I write you this letter, and I am surprised.  they don't look like they belong to me- the hands of a self-made millionaire.  The hands that once caressed gently the genuine leather of a brand new Cadillac every other year.  The hands that built buildings and made good investments.  They're old now, these hands - and I hold you personally responsible.  You took away all there was for these hands, everything from my wife to my Caddy to the orange tree in my back yard.  I can see in your eyes a certain type of pity.  Not the type of pity where you feel sorry for someone.  It's more like when your mathematics teacher explains to you how to work a problem and no matter what words he uses, you just can't see the solution.  You must think I don't get it.  That I'm in denial about my transgressions.  Sure there were times that I could've done things differently.  I could've been a little nicer to my family.  A little less materialistic.  I should've went to church willingly with my wife, which is an activity I have resolved to do once my freedom is returned to me.  I suppose I could've cleaned up my mouth a little... all of these things, Dear Warden, they are my sins.  But in what world do such crimes warrant a life sentence in a prison such as this?  There was no trial, no justice for me.  My daughter came to visit me the other day, and I fear she is ashamed of me.  It is good to see her face, to have her hold my hand and help me to my chair, but every once in a while she gets the same look in her eye as you have - that indescribable pity.  Sometimes I can see that her temper is short, that her worries are more than a father in prison.  I can tell that she visits me out of obligation, an unspoken rule that children are supposed to reciprocate the care they received growing up.    Perhaps that's my crime.  I didn't love my children fiercely enough.  I didn't take the time to get to know them, I didn't take time with them at all.  I wasn't the father that brought home surprises tied with frilly little bows for my daughter.  I wasn't the father that took his son fishing and camping every summer.  But I had a business to run, I tell you!   I was important!  I was successful!  Was... successful.   I think Dot would agree, I don't feel like I've succeeded by landing a residency in these halls.  And how shall a man measure his life's success?    Your stare frustrates me, but the familiarity of it gives me peace.  I know your place in this prison is to keep us from harming ourselves, and I respect that.  I beg of you, Dear Warden, to hear my case in person.  To speak with me, and tell me what my crime was, as you must know better than I.  I'm innocent!  I did nothing!  My request today is that you hear my plea, and that you set me free immediately, so that I might reunite with my wife and make up for promises broken in the past.  My plea is that you set me free so that my children are in turn set free of their obligation to me, as I can see now that I am a burden while in this prison.    I beg of you, Dear Warden, for pardon.  Signed Sincerely, Eugene Heart   	It was my first shift as a nurse in the Santa Maria Assisted Living Center, Alzheimer's Unit.  I saw a man sitting in the hall, staring down one of the long hallways at a picture of Jesus on the wall.  In his lap was a yellow legal pad and a blue crayon.  	"That's Eugene," said a voice from behind me.  It was another nurse.  I squinted to see her name emblazoned on her scrubs.   	"Claire...is it?," I said. "What's his story?"  	"Pretty much the same as all of 'em.  He suffers from dementia and can hardly talk thanks to a battle with throat cancer a few years ago.  His wife died about two years ago, and his family couldn't care for him any more.  He hasn't really adjusted, and all he does is sit there and stare at that picture of Jesus.  Oh, and he asks for pen and paper. 'Parchment' is what he calls it sometimes.  Kinda cute.  Oh, if you go by him and he asks for pen and paper, get it right away.  Sometimes he goes into fits if he doesn't get it right away."  	"What's he writing?", I asked.  	"Nothing, as far as we can tell.  Every once and a while there will be scribbles or a small picture, but nothing, really.  And another thing, he may grab you as you go by.  He'll rip a page off, fold it up really slowly, and tell you 'give to warden'.  We think he may have done some time in prison when he was younger..."

         I can't even imagine a day in the life of a soldier...     I can't imagine what it's like to know that all anyone can talk about is the mistreatment going on...     I can only imagine, when that day comes - where there will be no war, no pain, no suffering, no CNN... As the song goes: I can only imagine, when that day comes -      "Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?  Will I dance for You Jesus, or in awe of you be still?  I can only imagine..."  Some of us are closer to our final moments on earth than others, regardless of what is being fought for.  Remember that.

      So my poor little baby girl developed a bit of a rash 'down yonder'.  Not to release TMI, I went to Wal-Mart to purchase some Desitin to relieve her of her painful buttocks condition.  While looking at the ointment selection, I noticed a particular brand called (and I am NOT EVEN MAKING THIS UP) Butt-Paste.  It was seriously called Bordeaux's Butt Paste for Infants.  Now, there's a CEO who has a sense of humor and has had a kid with diaper rash.  I couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud in the middle of Wal-Mart.  I'm going to go to Edward Jones tomorrow and request to buy several hundreds of shares of the company that sells Butt Paste.  Heh....  Butt-Paste....  :)

      I'm pretty proud of myself for figuring out how to add pictures and comments to my blog.  And my Kudos to Blogger.com as they made both options much more dummy-friendly than they were before.  If you read my blog, can you please PLEASE post a comment to me on this or a previous post, so I can know that it works.  I believe you just click on the little 'comment' on the bottom.  Don't be afraid or shy.  I'd actually like to get a comment from everyone that reads it as I have lost track of how many people I have given it to.  And BTW, the following picture doesn't really have significance, it's just the ambiguous filename I picked from the file library.  In case you wondered, that is James' dad and step-mom, Joy, out in Arkansas - with Tyler and Mackenzie and the dog is a Great Dane named Jazz.

      In the ninth grade I had a huge crush on a guy named Nate Powers.  He was the cutest thing.  All of my friends knew I liked him, and I think maybe we would've hooked up if he hadn't have left Italy at the end of that year.  Not the point.  That summer, my bored and so-called friends decided to have a little fun at my expense.  I worked at the Fleet Post Office as a summer hire and they got the 'adults' that worked there to agree to make it look as if a package had arrived for me from my beloved Nate Powers.  Of course, being about 14 and ignoring the finer evidence such as there was no way Nate would've known my address, I was ecstatic to think that he had remembered me after all.  When I opened the box, it was a brick with a note attached that said, "Ha! We got you! Love, Aubrey, Meagan, Antonio and Deanna."  Yeah, thanks.  Alas, I never received anything from Nate Powers.  And eventually I moved on.  It is hard to find the joke funny when your heart thinks something is sincere.  Which is what I was thinking about tonight as I watched the WB's mockery of American Idol, in which they are turning down good singers and passing through those that have no talent.  Practical jokes are one thing.  But breaking someone's heart isn't really funny and I think it's disgusting that these networks are making a dollar at the expense of someone's feelings.  What is funny or even interesting about telling someone that has no vocal talent that they do, just to tell them in the end it was a show about finding the worst voice in the USA?  Why are these networks building people up just to tear them down?    If my child was on this show, I'd be raising hell.  Because if there's one thing I won't tolerate in the life of my children it is for their hearts to be broken in this manner.  For them to be set up, duped, played - and by people whose only motives are money and ratings.  I can't bear to think of having to help my children through real heartbreaks- first loves, losing friends or relatives, not making it on the team or losing the big game - why WHY why WHY are there people out there that are setting these things up?  Isn't there enough heartache in the world without us having to create more for viewing pleasure?  Please PLEASE stop the insanity!!!!!!  (I'm sending this to the WB)

      One of the earliest series I can remember Charles teaching was the Wednesday night Bible study on the book of James.  I can remember Charles teaching us that if we weren't going into,  coming out of, or smack-dab in the middle of a trial, we ought to be concerned, because "the testing of your faith develops perseverence.  Perseverence must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything" (James 1:3,4).  If God's not working on you, it's a bad sign about where your life may be headed.    It would be easy to focus on the negatives concerning the events leading up to Charles' resignation.  It's very easy to place blame and very hard to keep my heart from hardening towards certain people and religion as an establishment in general.  But the one most important thing I have learned from the Hanks family is that God's plan should never be underestimated.  Through the Hanks family, many people have been witnessed to and many have been lead to a relationship with Jesus Christ that they had not known before.  Their family will never know the true measure of their success in Alamogordo because there is no way for them to tell where or when their influence will cease, if ever.  Through the Hanks family, many people have shown their true colors, and though the human reaction is to condemn, criticize and complain about these people, the Hanks family's behavior reminds us to pray for God's plan and that God's work be at the heart of all the church members say and do.    When Charles resigned this evening, he looked more at-ease and happy than I have seen him look in a long time.  I understand what it is like to make a decision that is the best for your life, that you prayed about and you know is God's will, but it still hurts.  It's a trial, it's supposed to hurt.  I thought I would feel heartache when the inevitable event of the Hanks family leaving us would come to pass, but I don't feel heartache at all.  I am happy that God chose to grow the Hanks family here for a while.  I firmly believe that everyone we come in contact with, no matter how briefly, is someone God put there for a purpose, to leave their mark.  (Read a few blogs down.)  Or maybe in Charles' case for us to leave our marks with him, to make him the Pastor that God wants him to  be somewhere else.  And I'm alright with that.  It's all part of a bigger picture.  Charles said in a sermon once that we, as a church had a choice to make.  We had to grow or we were going to die.  I think the church has made its choice.   We can't grow without a pastor that has the kind of vision Charles does, and its obvious that they won't be looking for another Charles.  So I've decided to see the church as I did my 80-some-odd year old great grandmother when she was nearing her final days.  That sometimes death is what needs to happen to ease pain and let people grow.  Someone said that leaving the church would be a mistake as all of the new Christians we have had join need to be ministered to.  Let us not overestimate our roles in other people's lives - we are NOT responsible for their salvation.  Witnessing, yes.  we should be doing that anyway.  As for the growth of new Christians, they need a shepherd, not a bunch of sheep telling them what they think is right.  There's a reason not everyone is called to ministry - it is no doubt the most delicate of all professions.  I fear for the new Christians in our church, and even for my own faith.  Jesus talks about the church as a body, and I would consider the Pastor a vital organ, one without which the body cannot survive.  It's useless to try to use your ministry gifts in a church that doesn't have a heartbeat.  Hopefully soon we might witness that the death of a church gives new life to everyone that has had to stand through the trial.  To Charles, Brenda, Chad, Cody and Clay: Thank you for all you have shown me, and for the work you have done here, and for the trials you've endured so gracefully.  You are no doubt being prepared for bigger things, in God's name.  Please stay in touch.

      Just when you blog negatively about your husband, he does something that warrants a serious blogapology.  James has been attending a Dale Carnegie class for the last 12 weeks.  He's mostly moaned and groaned about having to go and been less than enthusiastic about the fact that his employer required his attendance at the class but also  required  him to pay half of the $1400 pricetag.  But he still came home every Monday night talking about the people he was meeting and the stories they were telling.  If you've never heard of Dale Carnegie, it's a self-improvement course for learning how to communicate more effectively with others.  So anyway, in the last 12 weeks, James has stunned me several times with his newfound communication skills.  Like several weeks ago when I brought up renting office space.  We were having lunch together and the exact words out of his mouth were "I admire and respect what you do.  I couldn't work out of the house; I'd get sidetracked watching ESPN all day."  I wish I could have seen the look on my own face at those words, from the man whom I typically get what I want from, but not without a good prolonged knock-down, drag-out "my way makes more sense" kind of fight.    He is the conservative in our relationship.  He worries about the bills.  He has reservations about spending money to make it.  So that conversation that day at the Waffle House was a great milestone for him, because he continued to tell me he could see the value in renting office space and even though he would no doubt worry a little bit, he knew it is what I needed.  Wow.  But it gets better.  He wanted me and Rhonda (his twin sister) to come to his graduation session.  All of the class participants had to get up and talk about a defining incident from the class and their vision for their future.  All of them got up and spoke about what a difference a little communication skill had made in their personal and professional lives.  James got up and talked about a defining moment at work, where he realized the value of the principle of backing up what you say with evidence.  How if someone did a good job, tell them  why  you like what they did.  He said he felt he has always been good at showing support, but he has learned the value of telling people something uplifting to them, not just saying 'thanks'.     So, in the car on the way home, we got to talking about the class - all of the people, what he learned, what it all meant to him.  He had said in his talk that his point was if you love someone, tell them why.  If you like what someone's done, tell them why. He piqued my interest by saying he was going to talk about me, but at the last minute he didn't think he could without being too emotional.  (He is NOT an emotional kind of guy.)  I asked him to tell me, and he looked at me the way he did several years ago when we were dating - the look of 'I'm going to say something you might consider cheezy, and I'm embarassed to say it'.    We had gotten out of the car to pick the kids up and he gave me a great big hug and said, "You always ask me how much I love you, not why I love you. You're my rock.  My everything.  You gave me two beautiful kids.  You're my reason." (I'm crying!!)   Now, I have known for years that my husband's love language is in the way he takes care of me and the kids.  It's how he jokes with me and how he acts like I'm driving him crazy.  It's how he usually tells other people nice things about me more than he really tells me nice things.  There's never been a doubt in my mind that he loves me.  Every once in a while, he'll say something and catch me completely off-guard.  But he has never, ever, in 8 years, told me  why  he loves me.  It occurred to me that I never really had a need to know 'why', but hearing him say those words was like standing in my very own chick-flick, starring me.    I suppose I may never hear him open up like that again, and that's okay.  It wouldn't mean as much to me if he said things like that every day.  So I guess I should thank good ol' Dale Carnegie for teaching my husband how to say the things that matter.

      For James' birthday, which was on the 7th (he's officially 32!), one of his best friends and I conspired to surprise him by flying said friend in for the weekend.  So I went to El Paso and picked up Shawn on Friday, and brought him home.  Shawn walked into the house first and my mom and I could hear him say "What's up, BITCH!" to James, and heard a surprised expression though we missed the look on his face.  And this was just the beginning of the boyish regression.  On Saturday, I had a wedding shower to go to.  I left my kids in their father's more-than-capable hands, for only like 2 hours.  I left at 4, and when I came back at about 6:30, Tyler was in the backyard half covered with mud and Mackenzie was sleeping.  James and Shawn were playing Madden 2004 or some crap like that on the playstation.  Here's the ensuing conversation:  Me: "Where's my kids?"  James pauses the game and looks around, as if the question is a little complex. "Tyler's either outside or in his room and Mackenzie's in bed."  Me: "Why is Mackenzie in bed?  It's only 6:30."  James: "She was really fussy, so I thought she was tired.  I just put her down like half an hour ago.  She cried a little but now she's quiet."  Me:  "Did you feed her dinner?"  Stunned silence.  James:  "Dinner?  I thought you fed her."  Me: (ANGRILY) "I left at four! She was probably hungry!  I can't believe you didn't feed her!!!!!  (Insert harsh line about taking responsibility or something)  The insert two hours of subtle steaming from the bout of parental incompetence my husband displayed.  Good thing his friend was in our company or I would have really went off on him.    So here's my theory.  When I was 17 and James was 23 and we started dating, our maturity levels matched.  Somewhere around his 28th birthday I think I surpassed him, and he is now in a state of 30's regression aggravated by the presence of other regressingly mature male species.  Sometimes, it's like I have three kids.  Gotta love it though, as his boyish faux pas keep me laughing (after I get over the anger.)

      My fault for LOL at my sister-in-laws blog about a wasp thing on steroids invading her home.  Last night, while I was minding my business doing laundry, I look down and see this HUGE brown spider.  I go get a shoe, then think, "no, too big a mess".  So I opt for the slow and no doubt more painful death-by-bugspray.  As the thing is curling up in the corner, I go outside to get take the top off the hot tub, which I was happily going to sit in and read and pray that the 103 temp would soothe all the muscles I can't move right now BECAUSE I TOOK A STEP CLASS AT 530 IN THE MORNING on Tuesday.  Pain- it's how you know you're still alive.  Which is good because I barely remember taking the class as my brain functions at about 10% that early in the morning.  And I hear I'm going again tomorrow.  Anyway, back from the diversion..... As I step outside, I notice something crawling in the space between the hot-tub and the house.  Sure enough, it's a nice-sized black widow, just a'spinnin'... (Hey maybe I should try the spinning class at the gym....)  Because of its size and obvious markings, I thought it may be pregnant and was not up for tousands of teeny tiny black widows running all over the place so I grabbed the bug spray once again.  Later I scooped them into a dust pan and left them out where James could see them.  Evidence.  Habeus Corpus.  Please, please,  please , honey - I begged him.  If there's anything you do tomorrow, will you call the Bug Lady??????  She's a long-time friend of ours and I don't know what it is she uses but after she sprays, the bugs that don't turn up dead officially organize a march to the house next door.  Good for them.

      I have a new theory.  It is that when my son starts sleeping like a normal person (or abnormally sleeping like a teenager) is certainly going to be about the same time that my daughter will turn in her angel-wings as the family's easiest sleeper and become the night-stalker that runs in her blood.  My theory is, they can't help it.  Someone made a comment in Sunday school about how kids don't sleep; they  recharge .  No statement has ever been truer, and my 5-year-old only needs about 20 minutes in the car on the way home to be ready for the next 12 hours.  And by the way, if you think your kids are playing nice and quiet, and you think it is because you're an awesome mother and you've got great kids, think again.  They might just be playing in the toilet.  Tyler:  "But Mom, I flushed it first!"

      Rumor has it that the Pastor is leaving.  I don't know if it's true, but I suppose it's just a matter of time before the geriatrics get their way anyway.  I'm so mad I can't even blog about it right now.  Half the church is probably ecstatic about the rumor and the other half (majority) that supported him are probably going to be mad at him for "abandoning" us.  If I were him, I'd jump ship, too.  Apparently he missed the part of his job description on the application that requires him to be perfect to be a pastor at a little church in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico. UGHHHHH.

      I have to share how my husband and I spent our 7 year wedding anniversary, which was today.  Don't worry, it doesn't even breach a 'G' rating.  First of all, we both thought it was yesterday.  We knew it was the 28th (or so he admits), but we both thought the 28th was yesterday instead of today.  Thinking it was on Sunday as of all last week, he took me out to lunch on Friday and we rented a movie to watch that night- "Eurotrip" (which was funny but not nearly as funny as its predecessor RoadTrip).  So anyway, having celebrated our anniversary 'early', I really didn't expect a whole lot today.    James calls me at around 3 and asks me where all of our credit cards are.  We're trying to get our debt under control, and we both (though he won't admit it) have a nasty habit of putting the cards up and saying we won't use them only to go get them out of their hiding places (like seriously we hide them from ourselves) to use them for things that shouldn't be charged in the first place.  So when I tell him that I froze them, he's silent.  He thought I meant that I called all the companies and closed the accounts or something.  What I really did was stick them in a plastic cup of water and put the cup in the freezer, which I read is an effective way to quit using your cards without actually destroying them - they still exist but aren't exactly accessible unless you get desparate and break out the hair dryer.  I said, "No, you dork.  I FROZE them.  Literally.  They're in the freezer.  In ICE.  FROZEN."  He said, "Quit talkin' to me like I'm dumb.  I can't believe you froze them.  Guess you aren't getting flowers."  So I proceeded to tell him very seriously that I didn't need flowers, he had already spent money on me and if he really felt he had to get me something, just pick me up a  bag of M&M's.  (That is all most women really want, anyway, right?  Just hand over the chocolate and no one gets hurt.)    I  came home from work, and while dealing with a cranky and getting-sick Mackenzie and a Tyler that turned all my metal bowls upside down on the kitchen floor and pounded on them with my GOOD wooden spoon until it broke, I made James lasagna for dinner.  When he got home, he had seven red roses for me, a bag of M&M's and a card.  The funny thing is, he doesn't read my blog.  (It would have to have a score ticker or a play of the day on it to keep his attention long enough to read it!)  But the card he got me says on the front, " '...This is my beloved, and this is my friend...'  - Song of Solomon 5:16 "  (I love Song of Solomon!)   Then on the inside, left it says "God left no detail to chance.  He planned it all for His purpose. - The Purpose Driven Life"  Which I know he knows I love 'Purpose driven Life', but it was always sort of one of those things that I thought I rambled on about and he just listened out of obligation.  On the inside right it says - "I'm so glad God brought us together, and that He knew long before we did that we would share our lives with each other.  You are His gift to me, and I will always be grateful.  Happy Anniversary.  Signed, Love Always, James."  (Sigh!)  This from the guy that isn't really very good at self expression unless the wrong team is winning the game.  When we first started dating (almost nine years ago!) he would give me these really romantic cards and gifts all the time, then of course for a while I ragged on him about not showing the love enough.  Now, all I ask for is a bag of M&M's and I get more than I wanted or expected.  I guess some women want to get flowers all the time (they're probably the ones that don't have a reason to put their plastic in the freezer), and for a while when I was younger I thought that was how a man was supposed to show a woman how he felt.  Now I guess it means more that the card he got me references one of my favorite books and one of my favorite verses and tells me that after seven years,  after one miscarriage, one banged up car, countless fights about money, a few borderline major screwups and two beautiful kids, we're still friends.  I couldn't ask for more.

      There's two things Tyler said today that had me cracking up.   The first one was when he was talking to me, and I don't remember the whole conversation, but in proper context, he says, "I bend you parting?"  I said, "what?"  He repeats, "I bend your parting- you know what you say when you want someone to repeat what they said?"  I say, "Oh, you mean, 'beg your pardon'?"  He says, "Yeah, that's what I said.  Bend your parting."  It was cute.  But not as cute as the peanuts thing.  Over the past few weeks I have had to do some basic explaining about (to the extent of my knowledge) male anatomy.  I tried to tell Tyler that calling the male 'privates' by their proper name is nothing to be ashamed or embarassed about and we talked about 'appropriateness'.  Ahem... so while Tyler was getting out of the tub tonight, I heard him yelling down the hall, "No sniffing the peanuts!  No sniffing the peanuts!!"  I walked down the hall to see what was going on and sure enough he was swatting at the dog who was trying to lick him.   Peanuts?  Close enough, I guess.  Ah... out of the mouths of babes.

      Redhead muse... I miss your blog!  If you start a new one I promise not to alert the old flame...  elections are coming so I have to have someone to educate me on the finer points of being a democrat.  Agency NM... where is your blog?  I'm tellin' ya, you could use the therapy.  Also, you and Dan know more about me than I know about you, and that's just not fair.  You could turn my research questions into a blog all your own.    Yeah, I'm talkin' to you too, Dan.  I haven't come up with a disguise name for you, but I'm thinking of Dan the Master of Impaired Expert Navigation.  You may not even recall why, but that'll be the fun in it.  Devon- Okay.  I'm trying to get my kids to eat more natural foods and I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.  The best I seem to get is hotdogs and bananas, with jello fruitsnacks.  And then there's always the ever-present easy access to chicken McNuggets.  Thank goodness McDonald's now sells apple slices, though I am sure there are six tons of preservatives in them.  I imagine unless I learn how to slaughter my own cows and grow my own potatoes, eating more naturally just isn't going to happen here.  What's the name of that book you are reading?  I'll FedEx you some milk.  I'm so happy you are having another one... you're the best mom ever.  To my uncle- if you are still reading this, I'm still working on it.  I still have questions for you but I really need to get my act together.  Hey, we were watching COPS last night and they were in Jacksonville.  Mom and dad kept trying to watch out for people they know, especially Lynn or Robbie.  (They were showing the VICE squad at work, so you never know...)  To James- 7 years and counting...

      I've been cleaning my house for like two days straight now.  It's not that it's that dirty or anything, I think it's me.  If you add together the two children, the husband and the dog, I'm picking up after an average of 7.5 people. (Here's the math: children under 2 qualify as 2 people.  Husbands qualify as 3 for obvious reasons.  People ages 2 to 10 qualify as 3 but get a 2 person discount because they HAVE THE ABILITY to clean up after themselves if a large enough reward is offered.  All dogs count as 1 but have a .5 surcharge if they shed.  Makes sense now, doesn't it?)  That's an army in some parts of the world.  I would say I'm sadly outnumbered.  Then there's the refrigerator incident.  (Just one of the multitudes of reasons husbands qualify for 3 people)  My wonderful spouse did me a favor and cleaned out the refrigerator several days ago.  I was really proud.  Being that we're busy and eat out a lot, a few dishes had accumulated in the sink and as shameful as it is to admit, sometimes I do the dishes just like once a week.  Anyhoo, James forgets to mention that some of the items he removed from the refrigerator were deposited as is in their containers in the sink, hidden beneath a plate and a sippy cup.  I did the dishes yesterday and came across the foulest smelling think-it-used-to-be-salad thing I've ever encountered.  So I did what anyone would do, I held my breath and poured the mess down the garbage disposal.  Then I turned it on, followed it up with baking soda and some ice, which is supposed to (According to Heloise) make it so the disposal doesn't get stinky.  I rinsed the dish out, washed it with soap and water and stuck it in the dishwasher for the sanitizing power of ultra-hot water.  This is a great story so far, isn't it?  I finish loading the dishwasher and turn it on, using the last drop of detergent I had.  When the thing gets on it's drying cycle, I walk in the kitchen and smell the same old salad nastiness wafting from the vent on the front of the dishwasher.  The dishes are clean, but the air in there smells like 3-month old lettuce and milk. YUCK.  I don't really know what to do to get that smell out of my dishwasher, other than turn it back on again.  And again.  And again, this time with baking soda.  Over two days I have washed that load of dishes six times.  I think the smell is finally gone.  And the dishes are clean.    So anyway, it's been two days of nonstop cleaning, organizing, and restarting the dishwasher. I was up until about 3 am last night ironing clothes and mopping the kitchen floor.  Oh, and washing peed-on bedclothes.   You can't get mad at the little ones for wetting the bed, but I have washed peed-on stuff EVERY DAY!!!!  And FYI, for little boys, those pull-ups or Goodnites don't work.  They don't leak, but apparently they can be  missed , which is sort of odd, but I'm not a boy so whatever.  Now I feel like I have a Lysol hangover.  And I should be working not blogging.

      ... I bet it sucks!  If someone is willing to publish  urlLink The Devil and Barry Manilow , then certainly someone will be willing to publish my unwritten insurance fraud thriller about the young insurance agent that thwarts even the most devious insurance fraud plots, like the roofing company that goes around town telling unsuspecting clients that they have 'a little hail damage', so if you call your insurance company, the roof you were going to replace anyway will only cost you your deductible.  Ay caramba!  But seriously, things like this give me hope.  Now if I would just actually write something.

      Okay, so it may be fairly unchristian of me, but I have never really been able to get myself to feel sorry for the Iraqi prisoners.  Now they've decapitated two of our civilians, people who were over there serving other purposes rather than to die for their country, and we're still supposed to feel sorry for humiliated Iraqi prisoners.  Uh-uh.  Eye for an eye they say.... that's their thing, isn't it?  Not that I'm against human rights, but if the photographs taken of the prisoners by Americans saved even one soldier's life, it was well worth it and as American voting public, I'd ask them to do it again.  War isn't supposed to be quaint, and I can only imagine the soldier's point of view.  Yes, we humiliated them.  They publicly decapitated two Americans.  There's no contest.  They win the bad taste award.  Too bad their choice of public assasination won't affect an election for them.

      I'm a traveling companion along with my sis-in-law for the two winners of our local preliminary Miss America pageant.  It's for Miss Alamogordo and Miss Otero County (herein referred to as Miss A and Miss O).  Of course, these two go on to compete in Miss New Mexico, and then Miss New Mexico gets about 1.5 minutes of airtime on the nationally televised Miss America Pageant.  As a traveling companion (TC, as we are lazy enough to name it), we take Miss A and Miss O to several local events throughout the year and then are responsible for being a mom-like figure during Pageant Week leading up to Miss NM.  SOOOOOOO.... That's what I was doing all last week and consequently had no time to blog.  However, the urge has become to strong so here I go.  Ten reasons why I'd rather be a TC than a contestant...  10.  There's this thing called a goodie bag that Rhonda brings to everything. Chocolate, Pringles, Snack Mix, you name it.  The difference:  I don't have to worry about what I'll look like on stage in my swimsuit after I eat 3 Rice Krispy treats and half a can of Pringles.  9.  Those fake boobs they sell on late night info-mercials?  Yeah, every pageant girl has a set.  And they DO come off when you sweat.  8.  If you really want to play the game, you have to hire Michael the unlicensed hairdresser from Albuquerque who was obviously exposed to way too much aerosol as a child because HE looks more like a girl than I do and wears the makeup to prove it.  Some swear he's not gay but there are flame detectors going off all around him.   However, you too can let Michael turn you into Pageant Vomit for a mere $1000 bucks a week.  7.  Butt-spray.  6.  Have you ever had your boobs taped together?  Or had to tape some poor girl's boobs together?  Not fun for anyone involved.  5.  A pageant is completely subjective, and sometimes it's obvious that the jugdes are really those deaf, dumb and blind monkeys.  4.  TC's never have to act nice to wolves disguised as girls in capris.  We can just ignore them.  3.  We don't have to sing, dance or play the piano.  Or draw our own hands or do magic tricks twirl a baton.  2.  The lifestyle and fitness portion really is just a "how good you look in your bikini contest".  Let's face it.  If they wanted to really judge lifestyle and fitness they'd be at the track timing laps and in the gym counting reps.  Whatever.  1.  Losing.  I became very attached to our girls this year and it BROKE MY HEART when neither one of them made the tp ten.  we expected at least one to make the top five or win talent, neither of which happened.  So the number one reason it's better to be a TC is that it SUCKS to lose!!!!  Those girls give that pageant everything they've got and it is aweful when it is obvious that its more about politics than real talent.  And I'm not biased.  Our girl has the lead role in Evita here and was touted by many as being the best talent in the pageant,  especially by other professional performers.  BUT no,  the judges saw to it that one of the agreed worst talents won the talent contest.   AGHAGHAGHHHHHHHH!    There you go.  Don't you just want to run right out and join your local pageant's board.  You should.  It's a good cause and ultimately the girls get life skills out of it that they could learn no where else, and normally they will walk away with a small scholarship just for competing.

      I went to a meeting tonight at church that was an explanation of an intentional interim program for our church to consider in light of the recent vacancy left by Pastor Hanks' resignation.  I was expecting to feel better about our church and its future, but I feel worse.  The explanation of the program, which calls for a "rediscovery" of the church's vision and goals, poses a few obvious questions for me.  The first is that while Pastor Hanks was here, the church came closer to have a vision and a direction than I have ever seen it.  I can't figure out how people can sit there and say for the last three years, there has been lack of organiziation, direction and leadership.  Though no leader is perfect, and a fatal flaw of being wet behind the ears (as Charles was when he came to us) is that you have to try a few things out and see what works.  Of COURSE a pastor with 28 years of experience isn't going to have the same type of organizational challenges that Charles had.  On the other hand, Charles had a vision, and a direction, and the God given gift to show that to others and set them on fire for God, too.  So, I don't think searching ourselves for our goals and a vision for the church is a remedy for the problem at hand.  The plan also calls for (what I now consider a four-letter word)  committee  of about 16 to be the 'transition team', to evaluate the by-laws, goals and vision of the church and rearrange them to suit the church body and make it easier to hire a new pastor.    I don't see it happening.  I can just about guarantee that the 16 people chosen to fulfill this job will not represent what the younger generation wants.  It is a church that doesn't want to change.  I believe the rift between the two groups of people in the congregation is so deep and so wide and so treacherous that no human being can bridge the gap.  Thus, we have to rely on God to build the bridge... and I can't imagine the judgement He must be placing on the people who want to form a committee and take a vote before they'll accept God's plan for the bridge.  I can pray for healing to take place, but I can also see clearly that the gap was started generations ago and that it might be several generations from now before the decendants of First Baptist Church come to a realization that God built that church, not their grandma or grandpa who came to Alamogordo way back when and by golly that church wouldn't be there if  she/he hadn't tithed fatihfully 10% of  gross , not net.    I've said it before in this blog, and I'll say it again.  Sometimes the best prayer, the one that gives us most peace, is the prayer for death to finally come - in the form of mercy.  I think that this church HAS to die to be born again.  I think it has to weather a serious hardship for the people involved to be reminded of what is truly important in God's church.  I cannot see that in the next year and just by virtue of this program that all the old arguments will be settled and that everyone will finally love what is going on at First Baptist Church.    It's hard to not feel like I have a church home, but it's even harder to watch this 'rebuilding' being condoned by the church body when I feel like we DID have a vision - we WERE growing- Charles was doing a great job to a majority of the people.  So he left and now it is like we are starting from scratch and undoing everything he did - and for all that his family went through and all the sacrifices he must have made with his family and in his personal life - I can't support that.

      So yesterday, while sitting in the car waiting for something (I don't recall what or whom), Tyler says, "You're a mediocre mom."  (He was referring to the lines in "Bruce Almighty" which we had watched earlier that day, where Bruce is yelling about not being happy with mediocrity.)  Before the tears welled up, I said, "Tyler, do you even know what 'mediocre' means?"  (Remember, he is only FIVE.)  He said no, he didn't.  I explained what it meant.  I said it means not really great or outstanding, but not bad either.  Just average.  Then I did what no mom should.  "Do you still think I'm a mediocre mom?"  He said, "yep."  Then he said, "well, you're a little better than mediocre."  Hmm.  Wonder what he'll think when he's ten.

      So I had my wisdom teeth pulled today and was a little irritated that my wait to get them pulled was longer than the actual deed.  I was feeling pretty comfy for a good 20 minutes while they pulled those suckers out, then they showed them to me and wowed over how perfect it was, they didn't even have to break them apart to get them out!  (Yay?)  So it all went well except for the one time I puked upon arriving home due to the medicine.  I feel fine now and to be quite honest, I don't think I'm very doped up but my mouth isn't hurting the way I expected it to.  Maybe thats because I'm so used to being in pain with those teeth and constantly biting my gums.  So anyway, I guess if they truly are wisdom teeth then I am four times less wise as I was yesterday.  Oh well.  On a brighter note we saw Kenny Chesney and Uncle Kracker in concert the night before and it just might be one of the shiniest entertainment moments in my life ever when Kenny and Uncle Kracker sang (rapped) Kid Rock's 'Cowboy' (which I didn't know Uncle Kracker wrote).  That rocked.  Anyway - Mack's awake and seemingly nhappy so I must go for now.....

      Kelly won Miss Alamogordo last night, and I couldn't be happier if she were my own daughter or sister!  I prayed that she would win so I could have a year to really get to know her better (as the traveling companions take care of the girls, get them ready for Miss New Mexico next summer, etc.).  The Miss O winner was a girl named Sonya who is also really nice and seems like someone we'll have  a lot of fun with.    I'm glad the week is over, it was horribly stressful and sometimes downright out of control.

      Last year Kelly sang  urlLink 'Seasons of Love' , from the Broadway hit, "Rent"-  Five hundred, twenty five thousand, six hundred minutes- Five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear, Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes- How do you measure, measure a year? In daylights, in sunsets? In midnights, in cups of coffee? In inches and miles? In laughter and strife? Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes, how do you measure a year in the life? How about love? Measure in loves, seasons of love... Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan... five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes -  how do you measure the life of a woman or a man? In truths that she learned? Or times that he cried? In the bridges she burned, or the way that she died? It's time now to see that the story never ends, Let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends remember the love... Seasons of love  I fell in love with the song and became instantly attached to the bright shining girl that is Kelly Mohr last year.  She has one of those personalities that just beams, and you can't even hate her for being so gorgeous.  This year Kelly came back to the pageant, armed with experience from last year and ready to win.  I hadn't really seen her much since last year, since her mom sent her to Colorado to live with an aunt to get her away from a mentally and potentially physically abusive boyfriend.  That seemed to have worked, and this year Kelly seems a little bit stronger and a little bit wiser.  This year, though, I have become even more attached to her, helping her develop her interviewing skills and just connecting about life in general.  Kelly learned on Tuesday that she has  urlLink  Wegeners Disease  , which is a rare but potentially fatal disease.  It's an autoimmune disease in which one's white blood cells attack small blood vessels all over the body.  She's lost all of the cartilage in her nose (she doesn't look any different) which is usually the first area deteriorated by the body.  It can attack any system of the body, causing blindness, deafness, heart or liver failure. The cause is unknown and there is no known cure other than to put it into remission through steroids and chemo-type treatments.  Prognosis is good if it can be kept under control, though flare ups occur in half of all patients and your chances of having this disease are pretty much worse than your chances of winning the lottery.  I've talked to Kelly's mom, who has just recently completed treatments for breast cancer, and she seems to be more aware of the long-term implications of the disease (as I have become since researching it).  I'm still coming to conclusions but I think the way I feel about Kelly since hearing the news is that she's blessed.  Not because of the disease, but because just like any one else, she's not guaranteed a tomorrow.  Her advantage is that she hopefully won't waste her young adult years trying to convince the world she's indestructible - as most of us do in those years.  Maybe she'll know God sooner, if she doesn't know Him now.  When I look at Kelly now, I think about the irony that exists in the fact that she looks so healthy and is absolutely beautiful.  I pray for her mom and know how she must feel like she would do anything to take this on for Kelly.  I think about how blessed I am, how grateful I am that I'm not afraid of dying nor am I afraid to watch my friend die - and the only thing I fear is that we don't  live .  It's ironic that the song that makes me think of her every time I hear will now also remind me of just how precious every moment really is, not because of the song, but because of her.    I don't think she's had the time this week to contemplate the years ahead, but I think she's strong enough to fight it head-on once she realizes what it is.  I can't imagine being told at 17 that your life isn't going to be what you thought it was and that it might be a lot shorter than you'd have guessed.  I feel helpless to do anything for her.  I'm not sure what to say to her, other than to let her know I'm here for her if she needs anything.  I am really praying that she wins one of the local titles tomorrow night so that Rhonda and I will have a year to be with her and help her through her first year with this disease.  I'll always rememebr that on Monday night, when she finished rehearsing "It's Raining Men" (her song for this year), all the girls and moms shouted at her to sing Seasons of Love.  She sang the first few verses acapella, and there was not another sound in the building except for her voice.  It was beautiful. That was the day before she was dealt a tricky hand in life.

       Really, what good is it going to do anybody to shack Martha up for 5 months???&nbsp; Wouldn't it be a better punishment to just fine her the amount of money she gained (or saved herself from losing) by her little 'trade' and then have her pay all the court fees plus interest for the time spent that the American public has had to hear about this crap?&nbsp; I mean really, it's not like she killed someone.&nbsp; You know, like O.J.&nbsp; And whatever 'prison' she goes to, aren't they going to treat her like she's at a spa??&nbsp; "Here's your mimosa, Ms. Stewart."&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; All that her sentencing will do is provide lots of late night t.v. jokes that will no doubt get old quickly.

      I've been stewing in the ashes of burnout!!!  I don't know why, I'll guess its hormonal, but I really just haven't had the desire to do much of anything lately but have still managed to be busier than a one-legged man in a ... well, you know.  The isolation of being the only person representing my company in a 400-square mile chunk of New Mexico can be really daunting, but I have a new best friend!!!  I recently met with the guy who took over my account at the radio station, and believe me, I'm a small beans account.  But this guy is awesome, and does an EXCELLENT job of making me feel like my account IS important!  He has really lifted my sprits about my business and is helping me brainstorm about marketing things I can do in the future.  It is nice to finally have someone in town that can be a marketing sounding board and actually knows a lot about what works.  So thanks to Beau for helping me work myself out of my rut!!!  James and I went to dinner with Beau and his beautiful girlfriend, Tiffany (who is an old friend of James' from high school!) last night and had a good time just getting to know each other.  I've said it before and I say it a lot more- God sends people into our lives at the precise moment we need them and I really think that Beau coming to the radio station and replacing Laura is just another act of divine intervention in my life, because the future's looking quite a bit brighter.  Once again, my thanks to my God that blesses me even though I don't deserve it - and puts people in my life to help me along the way at every turn.    Hopefully in some way I am just as helpful in someone else's life as other people are in mine.

      We went to the pool on base yesterday.  They have a neat slide that is sort of the "main attraction", but isn't nearly as cool as the slides at a real waterpark.  Nevertheless, it's pretty high and fast and has always been Tyler's biggest fear.  Everytime we go to the pool, we ask him if he's ready to try the slide.  He always says "no" right away and we pretty much leave him alone about it, knowing his psyche is scarred due to an incident at Fiesta Texas where we took him on a ride that we swore wasn't scary - it was one of the big slides with a reaft that you fit like six people in.  There was only me and James and my dad and Tyler in it, so it was pretty light (considering) and it flew down the slides, nearly toppling over in all of the turns.  We're pretty sure that's where the fear of slides comes from.  So anyway, I asked him yesterday if he wanted to just go to the top of the tower and watch other people go down.  He wanted to do that, so we got up there and I started working on him to get him to go down.  Grampa saw the progress I had made by just getting Tyler to the top, and he told Tyler if he went down three times, he would buy him a paintball gun.  (Just ignore the warning on the package that says ages 11+).  Agh.  So, Tyler's want for a paintball gun was greater than his fear of the slide.  After he went down once, of course, he wanted to go down repeatedly and found it quite fun.  He even said "Thanks for taking me down the slide, Mom."  We went straight to WalMart where grandpa purchased a paintball gun and paintballs, which we took back to GRANDPA's house and shot at the fence (and birds).  So I think this one might win me a spot in the bad mom hall of fame, being that my five year old really isn't old enough to own much less fire a paintball gun, ride a motorcycle or own a TV/VCR, but he does.  I'm gonna say it's not completely my fault.  I mean it doesn't really make sense that he is not afraid to ride a motocross bike on his own but he's afraid to ride the puny little slide at the pool.  It's grandpa's fault.  At least I can say my son isn't a sissy!  And that bribery thing works fairly well, unfortunately.

       I read my sis-in-laws webjournal and thought it was funny how she commented on blogging unfairly about all the new cute things her daughter is doing and less about her son, Trevor. The difference between our boy and our girl is night and day.  I love my kids equally, mind you, but there's just something special about our little girls.  For instance, Mackenzie has had an earache since Friday and the meds upset her tummy.  So she woke up at about 4:30 this morning, and after I changed her I went to put her back in her crib, and she leaned away from it and started shaking her head "no" and pointing toward the door.  Now, she's eighteen months old and I don't really remember my son being quite so animated and vocal about his feelings, nor do I recall feeling like he understood anything I said but "no, no!".  So I laid her in bed next to me (she normally doesn't mind her crib, unlike our other need-to-cosleep child) and told her to go back night-night.  I guess she wasn't too tired because she just chatted and played with her feet.  Being used to talking to Tyler in bed instead o f her, I thought it was really funny when I got irritated by her jabbering and moving and pronounced "Do you want to go back to your own bed?"  She shook her head "no".  She totally understood, because I said, "Then be quiet and still and go back to sleep."  About fifteen minutes later she smacked me in the face, so I scooped her up, gave her a big hug and took her back to her crib.  She squealed defiantly for about two minutes then was out until about 9:30.  I was just really amazed though at the way she interacts with me for as young as she is.  But that whole sugar and spice and everything nice is true if you consider the "spice" part to be jabanero pepper juice - because I sure have got one heck of a firecracker on my hands.  She's not going to be afraid to express herself...  wonder where she gets that?????

      It's been a busy week.  I registered Tyler for Kindergarten on Wednesday.  This event was highly emotional for me.  I suppose its because it makes me feel like we're just a few PTA meetings short of middle age.  And I told James it's like this huge realization that we'll never have another little baby again (unless God steps in and thinks we should be blessed with a failure of tubal ligation which will probably happen the day Mackenzie graduates from high school and would probably be twins.  God's sense of humor....).  Buying his school supplies in Wal Mart was just as emotional.  It's like I can feel that every year now is going to be marked by school days and holidays and the years are going to fly by even more quickly than they are now.  It's silly, I know.  When I dreamed of having a family long ago, I never quite pictured myself the mom of teenagers or even ten-year-olds.  I guess when you want kids you think of them as babies because they stay that way for such a while.  But now it's like there will never be any more first birthdays or first tooths or first steps.  I guess I just didn't really think about it that much until I signed Tyler up for school.  Geez, I'll probably have to be checked into a looney bin when Mackenzie goes to school.  Yikes.
