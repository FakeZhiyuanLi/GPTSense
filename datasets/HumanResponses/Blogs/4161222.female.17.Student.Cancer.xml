       Not a whole lot going on lately that's happy...and my goal is not to make anymore depressing posts.  Basically, I'm having issues with Randy, my ex boyfriend, missing my little brothers, and having PCOS.  I'm feeling really dismal and unloved.

       So lately, I've been wonderin   Who will be there to take my place   When I'm   gone, you'll need love   To light the shadows on your face   If a great wave   should fall   It would fall upon us all   And between the sand andstone   Could you make it on your own   If I could,then I would   I'll go wherever you will go   Way up high or down low   I'llgo wherever you will go   And maybe, I'll find out   The way to make it   back someday   To watch you, to guide you   Through the darkest of yourdays   If a great wave should fall   It would fall upon us all   Well I hope   there's someone out there   Who can bring me back toyou   Runaway with my heart   Runaway with myhope   Runaway with my love   I know now, just quite how   My life andlove might still go on   In your heart and your mind   I'll stay with you for   all of time   If I could turn back time   I'll gowherever you will go   If I could make you mine   I'll go wherever you will   go               "Never a wish, greater than this, when you only got 100 years to live."

      I've listened to my No Doubt CD like WHOAS today.  I don't know why...I dug it out of the depths of my closet this morning and popped it into my stereo; it was awesome.  It's like...if you go without sex for a LONG time, when you do it again it's an "Oh my God" experience.  Well, it's the same for me and my No Doubt CDs.  Anyways, nothing much going on today.  I'm babysitting right now, and the boys and I are probably going to hit up the mall today.  I'm getting a little excited for school to start again, but I'm also really nervous about seeing my ex-boyfriend.  I haven't seen Brenton (Buggy) since...well, since school ended.  It's just been really, really, really different this summer.  I don't mean that like it's been bad, just different.  Last summer, Buggy and I were together for the whole summer, going right into school.  Now I'm with Randy, and he's not going to be there for me everyday (not that he doesn't want to be there, just with him living in Montvile, being 19, my strict parents, ect...we're not going to be seeing each other as much).  I don't want anything to end between us, but more than that, I don't want to be with him as school starts, be totally content, and in a few weeks hear him say, "I met this really great girl in one of my classes."  Ugh.  That would be  urlLink total devestation.   We discussed this briefly last night, but once again, no real progress was made concerning everything.  We are walking on eggshells.  There's stuff we just won't discuss because we're afraid it's going to spark conflict and fighting.  And it's really sad, when a relationship has to be like that, but what can I do?  Every time we try to have a "talk," things get about 93824793287 times worse.  It should be really easy.  I like him, he likes me.  End of story, right?  WRONG.   Relationships are, unfortuantely, not that easy.  I wish they were.

       Today was really, really, really bad.  I didn't get home from babysitting and get to bed until about 2:30 this morning...On the plus side of that I got $150 for babysitting for the night.  But, I had to get up at seven this morning to work and I was so tired.  Not to mention, I felt horrible when I got up this morning and I've been feeling sicker and sicker all day.  My throat is sore, I have a fever, and my eyes are really sore.  I have to get up at 7:30 tomorrow because I have to babysit again, but then I should be all set with waking up early for the week.  Today is Randy's birthday!  Happy Birthday Randy!!  I    Wednesday is my visit to Salve Regina; I'm really excited.  When Andrew and I went on the tour together, I  loved  it.  I mean it, I have a serious infatuation with this school.   So all that has to happen is that my parents have to decide that the Newport "lifestyle" isn't too....Newport for me, I guess.  Oh well.  So, I'm off to rest and watch some television, because I'm still feelin' pretty shitty.  Call my cell phone and cheer me up!!

       All in all, it's been a pretty crappy night, until I came home and decided to start a new blog.  So here you all go, have a blast reading it.  I'm just going to post some lyrics for tonight, because it was pretty horrible.  I don't want to start in on Randy, so i'll just leave that for after I calm down a little bit.                                           urlLink Jeff Buckley-Just Like A Woman
