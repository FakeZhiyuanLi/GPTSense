       Judging People    When you see someone walk,    People have the nerve to talk.    They make them sad,    By saying bad,    For no cause,    It's part of flaws,    To&nbsp;seek the bad and speak it.    For someone&nbsp;to have the nerve,    To think they deserve,    To try to change,    To range,    From the good to bad,    Make them mad.    Forget about if they do a good deed,    Because you think they're just bad seed.    You&nbsp;feed on what they do wrong,    They long on consuming the faults in people,    They go with insults.    Some have a desire to make themselves higher then everyone,    Some do it without noticing they say it.    Without thinking,    Analyze without realize,    Who they're hurting.    Then they find it hard to live,    Knowing they give,    A&nbsp;chain of pain,    To people they hate and discriminate against themselves.    Living in wonder,    Why&nbsp;they always have a friend,    To depend on.    Because they feel they don't deserve,    Don't serve a purpose.    They don't want shade,    They just wish they could fade,    From everyone's life.    Just sigh and die,    Because no one&nbsp;would cry.    Written by: Esty Jaffe     &nbsp;   Esty this is awesome!! i luv u girl! mwz to bad i couldnt come this week, but dw at the end of the summer we're gonna mad party!!

       Everything I need to know about life, I learned from Noah's Ark ...    One: Don't miss the boat.    Two: Remember that we are all in the same boat.    Three: Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark.    Four: Stay fit. When you're 600 years old, someone may ask you to do something really big. Five: Don't listen to critics; just get on with the job that needs to be done.    Six: Build your future on high ground.    Seven: For safety's sake, travel in pairs.    Eight: Speed isn't always an advantage. The snails were on board with the cheetahs.    Nine: When you're stressed, float a while.    Ten: Remember, the Ark was built by amateurs; the Titanic by professionals.    Eleven: No matter the storm, when you are with God, there's always a rainbow waiting...

       -My first job was working in an orange juice factory, but I got canned... couldn't concentrate.   -Then I worked in the woods as a lumberjack, but I just couldn't hack it, so they gave me the ax.   -After that I tried to be a tailor, but I just wasn't suited for it - mainly because it was a sew-sew job.   -Next I tried working in a muffler factory, but that was too exhausting.   -Then I tried to be a chef. I figured it would add a little spice to my life but I just didn't have the thyme.   -I attempted to be a deli worker, but any way I sliced it, I couldn't cut the mustard.   -My best job was being a musician, but eventually I found I wasn't noteworthy enough.   -I studied a long time to become a doctor, but I didn't have any patience.    -Next was a job in a shoe factory. I tried, but I just didn't fit in.           ~stolen from benji
