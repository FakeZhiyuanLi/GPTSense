      Today was boring in its own hectic way, I wake up knowing that school will be upon me in a matter of days, which made me even more tired and slept 2 more hours. s then when I finally come to be, I go to the kitchen and eat a pop tart and plop down on the couch, turn on my Laptop, and watched some TV.  fastforward to 5pm  ok  I am at Main event with some of my friends that I usually see there. kinda waiting for me to seriously kick ass on the dance pad.  when I was halfway through Paranoia Survivor, everyone was like "DAMN!"  then after completion everyone was cheering  and Im like seriously fatigued (for about 3 min.) and one of my friends said "you must be very tired"  but I was too tired at the time to respond

      first I had to eat luch and get clothes and get my dad a book for his trip to orlando.  At this time, I was seriously impatient and wanted to go to gameworks very badly so I went.  met my good friend Ben (aka bioclown) and went to the pad, the pad was slightly off. and yet I could still AA many songs, there was this one girl with a yellow shirt who was quite interesting she was quite good. one thing that was funny during that when someone played Sexy planet (oni remix) when the up-left, left, *repeat for a few times* everyone was doing a thrust it was quite amusing. I was behind a girl when doing but I wasnt directly behind her. then after a while i went to the ddrusa machine and I finally full comboed something on no speed mods, I got 3rd place on the machine as "GMP" (I messed it up alitte) then after wards, I played on the extreme machine with Ben; and alot of people wanted me to play Paranoia Survivor on Final stage,  when I did play, I kinda paced my self at the beggining and then when hell runs came, my shoelace broke and I wasnt sure if i was missing anything or not i was just followning the sequence to the best of my ability and surely enough, I passed it with a "B"  when I did my last run on ddrusa, I got number 2 on the ranking page and my old score was at 4th (my new score was initialed as "GPS")

      AH, this event takes place tommorow.  I have a ride, Bioclown, and Razor wind does.  Im not sure my friend Dontrel (A.K.A. Shujinko) has a ride though  so I am just gonna see what happens   but the problem with setting thing up like this, people are always turning to me for the scheduling and it gets complecated and I just stop meddeling the night before and see what happens with somewhat shitty results
