      What is it about  urlLink Froot Loops  that make them taste so good?  Is it the five pounds of sugar, the various color additives, perhaps just the round, donut like shape?  Perhaps the allure is that of Toucan Sam.  Who doesn't like a talking bird telling you to eat his cereal.  I think I know.  It was the fact that I was deprived of this particular cereal as a child and now, cannot get enough of them.  Yep, that must be it.  That or they use crack/cocaine in lieu of sugar.

      I don't claim to be all knowing in the world of English.  I actually consider myself to be quite ignorant.  However, I do know that there are certain things about people that really irritate me.  The primary thing that bugs me is people who refuse to speak English properly.  English is really not that difficult.  You don't need to know what a dangling modifier is or what a participle is, but one really should know the difference between "well" and "good."  I hope to some day be an English teacher to junior high school children.  Glutton for punishment some may say.  I just hope to instill some appreciation for proper English.  Being from Texas is not an excuse to say that a toy is "broke" rather than saying a toy is "broken."  I cannot stand that my mother in law, who teaches third grade, does not know the difference between "well" and "good."  She is a teacher for heaven's sake.  No wonder our public school system is so awful.  If the teacher's cannot practice what they teach, then how are they to expect a student to practice what they are taught?  Furthermore, saying something such as this is the year two thousand  and  four is WRONG.  A serious pet peeve of mine.  The year is two thousand four.  And is indicative of using a decimal point. A good example is when one writes a check.  If the amount for the check is $5.25, then one should write five  and  25/xx (or 00 whatever) dollars.  Okay, I think I am now done ranting.  Though this may come up again, as I tend to lose it after a time of witnessing such carelessness when using the (American) English language.

      I now have 5 $100 bills in my hand.  S sold our non-functioning mustang today.  These people actually paid money to buy a car that doesn't work, and they are going to find the trailer to come and get it.  Some folks are just nuts.  All I care about is the $500 I have that is terribly burning a hole in my pocket.  Ahh...the voice of reason and practicality is speaking to me once again. ( pay the bills )  Stupid reality.

      I think suffer from some weird form of insomnia.  I consume almost no caffine at all. I try to eat healthy and on a regular basis. I exercise in the mornings.  Yet, somehow, I am plagued by a likely nonexistent form of insomnia that doesn't allow me to sleep regardless of how exhuasted I am.  My eyes burn in their sockets.  My headaches increase in severity.  My thoughts become somewhat jumbled yet somehow clearer than before.  I lose all ability to focus in every sense of the word.  However, upon resting my head on my incredibly wonderful  urlLink tempur-pedic pillow , my eyes close and my brain keeps on going.  I think I'll go and lay awake for a while.

      I am actually finding random things that I would like to comment on, but when I go to blog, I forget what I wanted to write.  Then I feel as though I end up blogging some kind of junk that even I wouldn't really want to read.    I think I'm going to start writing down my thoughts or at least a brief idea of what I want to say.  That way, when I go to write something, I will have a list of things to choose from.  I have a pda, I might as well use it, right?  Whatever Gretchen, sure.  Just smile at the innocence, nod, and walk away.

      Except there is no old man snoring here.  There's too damned much water.  He can't sleep for fear of drowning.  I know that this part of Texas hasn't seen this much rain during this season in a long freaking time.  The weird thing is, I love the weather. I'm pretty sure that I am getting into the wrong business.  I should reconsider my major and go into meteorology or the like.  I could sit and watch clouds all day.  I thoroughly enjoy watching lightning.  I totally dig being in an airplane when it rains  urlLink (there's something on the wing!) .  I could never see myself chasing a tornado, but I know that the possiblity of being able to do so would be cool.  I stopped counting the time between thunder and lightning when I saw  urlLink Poltergeist   so many years ago. Hey, you never know.  I have no idea where I was going with this.....

      So we just got back from visiting the in-laws.  We spent most of the day today just sitting around their house.  BORING.  I asked S why didn't we go to the 1895 jail house (with gallows) turned museum when he and C, my father-in-law, had talked about going.  S didn't have an answer.  I said, even if it was closed, we could have just driven around the town and see what little there was to see.  His reply to this was that his parents were probably new to the area and didn't know their way around, so didn't have anything to show us.  Now, I'm thinking that this explanation is silly.  Half the fun of a new place is learning what all there is there.  To me that means driving around aimlessly.  When I was a kid, my dad was in the Air Force.  The first thing my brother's and I would do in a new place was go explore.  After we found our bikes of course.  I suppose that not exploring a new town is just a strange thing to me.  I guess when you have people that have lived in the same town for better than 30 years (though both come from military backgrounds), you kind of forget the fun in getting lost then trying to find your way home.

      I hate housework.  I don't have a dishwasher, so when the dishes get behind, they seem to take over the entire kitchen.  If you don't do the dishes after every meal, the next thing you know there is a mutiny in the works.  I have tried going on "strike."  Unfortunately that doesn't work.  S does try to help, but somehow I always end up having to finish what he has started.  This is usually silverware, and the pots and pans.  Sure, plates and bowls are easy, why do the hard stuff, when the easy stuff can be done? Ugh.

      Today will be a first visit for S, Shorty, and I.  We will be heading to my in-laws new place approximately 2 hours from here.  My father-in-law, C, is a minister and they were just relocated for the first time.  He had a change of heart to be a minister about 7 or 8 years ago.  He had been lucky to remain at the same church that they had been at for nearly 30 years. But this year, they gave him his own church, so he and my mother-in-law, V, had to sell the house they purchased brand new 30 years ago.  Now they are closer to us than before, only the town they are in has less than 5,000 people in it.  I get along fairly well with C and V.  I usually get "the look" from V about, well, it feels like nearly everything.  Anyone who has a mother in law would understand, I think.  So, I will be out all day.  No blog, no reading other blogs, no computer! Whatever shall I do!  Probably do the 15 minute walking tour of C and V's new town then stare at each other or the TV until dinner.  The nice part about the new house is that we will get to have a separate room from Shorty.  In their previous residence, we shared a room with Shorty and the computer.  This should be a very nice change.  Have a pleasant weekend, readers.

      I have a suspicion that there are days when our mailman does not come to work.  I believe this because I will go for days (usually not more than 3) without getting a single thing in the mail.  Not even junk mail.  This just isn't realitic.  Everyone gets junk mail, whether credit card offers, coupon catalogs, or just random "resident" mailings.  So how is it possible to go for 3 straight days without so much as a local businesses coupon mailer, and other mailboxes still have their little red flags up.  I really think that the "neither snow, nor rain, nor sleet, nor hail" or whatever the whole thing is isn't actually true anymore.

      Lately I have been hitting the gym with more regularity than most normal people ever do.  I'm actually pretty proud of myself for it.  Though the reasons for my doing it are probably not the best, but they seem to work for me.   1. I never lost all the weight after Shorty was born.  I am still 10 puonds over where I feel I should be.  I'll be happy with losing 5 and happier with 7, but 10 would be best.   2. S and I would like to have another baby soon, and I don't want to be "overweight" before I start gaining weight.   3. My mom has ballooned in recent years taking on the shape that my grandmother took in the last years of her life also.  Considering that my mom and I used to closet shop each others clothing, I realize that significant weight gain is likely a part of genetics.  I don't want to return to closet shopping with my mom, unless she comes back down to my size.  So I have begun exercising with vigor and even go alone, which is difficult when the gym on a college campus is filled with a bunch of 18 year olds wearing spandex that are looking for members of the opposite sex.  The best part, sad as it is to say, I got to show up some freshmen who thought they were too good to try certain styles of exercising.  Challenging a guy nearly 10 years my junior to try something and then watching him fail empowers me for some sad reason.    *maniacal grin*

      And so another year of my life has finished and a new one begins.  I expect a lot to happen in this 27th year.  I was given my very own pair of scuba booties for this birthday. Eventually, I will be getting my own fins. I'm going to spend some time experimenting with these items and learn to snorkel.  After that, I will attempt to get my open water diver certification.  How cool is that?!  I also got to have a luverly cake decorated by Shorty with every birthday candle he could find.  Not a difficult task for a 3.5 year old, I can assure you.  We had to keep the fire extinguisher close for this one.   Thank you Kalisah for the birthday wishes.  :)  Happy Birthday to Me!

      About this time, 27 years ago, my mom was in the early stages of labor.  She would experience the joys of said labor until 8:24am Greenwich mean time (about 12:24am cst).  I specify the time because I was born at the  urlLink Royal Berkshire Hospital  in  urlLink Reading, England .  My dad was in the air force, and I hold dual citizenship.  That's right dear readers, tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 27. To some of you I am still a baby, to others I am an old lady.    To steal a line from Garth Brooks, "I'm much to young to feel this damned old."  I have no special plans for my birthday.  Majority of my family is 250 miles away (some even further than that), and S and Shorty just don't know how to throw a party.  Even if they did, we have no real friends here to speak of, so it would just be the three of us anyway.  So tomorrow when you are having dinner, or your morning Mimosa, lift a glass to me.  Hey, I'd do the same for you.

      I love to sing.  I feel like I am on a stage and just belting out tunes that amaze the world over.  The trouble with my singing is that I really can't carry a tune that well.  I have a tendency to sing off key.  This really sucks since I enjoy singing and used to have delusions of grandeur that I would be overheard and signed to a huge contract.  Oddly, the only time I really can seem to sing well is in the car or at church... neither of which I do much of.  I don't sing much in the car because currently I'm cursed with a 1966 Ford Galaxie that only has AM (It's talk radio, oldies, or tejano all day! woo) and I don't sing at church because I don't go much anymore.  However, when a good song comes on my AM radio stations or I'm actually at church...watch out because I will belt out tunes at the near top of my voice.  hmm hmm hmm hmm

      Okay, so the curtains FINALLY got hung.  It took me forever because the cheapy little rods I bought, came with equally cheapy wall attachments.  I just gave up and busted out with the drill and electric screwdriver (mmm....screwdriver, could so go for one of those right now) and some screws and made those damn things stay in the wall.  Shorty now has curtains in his room and a brand new lovie blankie that he desperately needed.  The old one was really starting to look it and so S and I took him to the store to pick out new fabric for his new blankie.  If I never sew again it will be too damned soon.  But, jeez do I feel accomplished!

      I am so proud of myself.  I finally have started a project and actually completed it.  Virtually all my life I lived in rental properties or military installations.  I have almost never had curtains.  Until today.  I went out yesterday and bought an entire bolt of denim fabric (5.25 yards), and I am making curtains for Shorty's room.  I completed the first panel yesterday with almost no help!  S had to help a bit because the panels were so big, that I couldn't seem to work them alone.  Finally, that sewing machine my parents gave me for Christmas two years ago is being put to use! :)  My mom would be so proud to know that I actually tried to do it and succeeded.  The panel doesn't exactly look professional and it isn't square, but dammit, I did it and I'm proud!  Hopefully, when I'm all done and have all the panels installed (2 windows, 4 panels), then Shorty will sleep later.  He gets up because "the sun's awake" and therefore we should all be awake...at 6 am.

      This post follows a question asked by Chica and is the post I referenced at the end of Hi Dad.  To explain the relationship I have with my mom took me some time.  I needed to reflect on where we were and where we are today.  I have to say that I do not blame my mom for her difficulties in mothering.  She did not have a role model to follow that was capable of teaching nurturing skills.  So, to answer Chica's question I must start with some background.  My mom was raised by a paranoid schizophrenic mother and a father who might as well have been invisible.  Unfortunately, my mom never really knew the "right" way to parent her children and often exhibits the traits of schizophrenia she learned from her mother.  It wasn't until I was in high school that my mom finally realized she needed help (with the added persuasion of my father and the realization of not wanting to alienate me and my brothers as she was alienated by her mom).  My mom did really well trying to get over her past and we had started bonding as best as we could.  Then, I got married.  She couldn't handle the stress I suppose and started going downhill.  We seemed to be able to tolerate each fairly well, but only in small doses.  When I became pregnant, I think she really wanted to make an effort to be the mom to me that she wanted her mom to be to her.  She did everything she could to try and make things better.  She even became my stand in birthing class coach while S was working.  Things were going well. After a while, she started backsliding and became more judgemental of my actions in the caring for Shorty.  I didn't appreciate her scathing remarks and we would end up in bitter arguments.  These usually resulted in her crying and apologizing for being like her mother.   Anyway, making a long story longer than it needed to be, I can say that my mom and I do pretty well together. We can handle to be around each other for about a week, sometimes more or less.  We talk a lot more, and I try to convince her that she really wasn't a bad mom, she just didn't know any better.  I don't fault my mom for most of the belittling things she did (mind you she was never physically abusive) and on occasion does to me, but I know that I could never be her best friend either.

      So I've been wondering, maybe someone will know the answer.  Why is it that on our current calendar, September, October, November and December have prefixes that mean different numbers than their months represent?  Sept is seven, Oct is eight, Nov is nine and Dec is ten, but September is the ninth month and so on.  Anyone know?

      I don't know how many people have the opportunity to have close relationships with their fathers, but I have one with my dad.  I can call my dad with nothing to stay, but can spend an hour on the phone with him not really talk about anything.    S usually spends no more than 10 minutes on the phone with his dad, and others might spend even less than that.  I may not talk to my dad on a daily basis, but even when we do visit, I have been known to stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning just talking about anything and everything, save some topics (i.e. sex  *shiver, cringe*).  I think that the relationship I have with my dad is pretty special. I know it is better than the one I have with my mom.  Then again, that is probably why my dad and I have such a good relationship.  Of course, my mom is a whole other post.

      I live in the only place in Texas that has a legal clothing optional public beach.   urlLink Hippie Hollow  is a popular location around here, whether people have been or not.  Yesterday was my first visit.  At first I didn't quite realize that clothing optional meant ALL clothing.  I was initially trepidatious about removing my top, but then I realized that while this area is not a "gay" people spot, many of those who were there were busy checking out S rather than me.  So, yep within short order I was fully nekkid at a public park, in broad daylight, around other nekkid people, and I had so much fun!  Who knew that just hanging out on a lake without any clothes, on a really nice day to even out my tan would be so much fun!  The water was a perfect temperature and I don't generally like water that contains animal life in it.  I must say that I encourage others to try it at least once in their life.  If you can't be nekkid in front of complete strangers that you will likely never see again, who can you be nekkid in front of??

      S has a fascination with older cars.  Currently we are the proud owners of a 1966 Ford Galaxie 500.  This vehicle has now become mine since his car died and my car gets better gas mileage than the Galaxie.  I can assure you that I was not pleased.  The Galaxie has it out for me, I think.  There always seems to be something going wrong with it.  The problem is, whatever goes wrong with it tends to occur while I'm driving it and not while S is.  This stupid car has left me stranded at least three times now.  Let me add that I use it to pick up or drop off Shorty at day care.  Now imagine having to walk for a mile and a half with a three year old.  FUN!  Well, the number one reason that I hated this car was because it has no air conditioning.  Well, had.  Finally today, after owning the car for eight months, the air conditioner is now charged and blows cold.  I have finally found a new appreciation for this car.  And it isn't even August yet!

      My sheer obsession with other blogs on the web caused my husband to insist I get one of my own.  I have hesitated for a long time because I'm certain I live the most boring life possible, but I finally gave into the temptation.  I suppose I don't want to be a person with a book that noone wants to read, but I don't want to say I never wrote a book.  Reasonable right?  So here it goes, my first ever attempt at keeping a record of my own musings....not counting my junior high school diary which is just laughable.  Har De Har Har Har

      I have been reading blogs for some time now, okay really only a few months in reality.  Since the end of October.  I started reading blogs through accident. I was trying to locate a business in the Houston area and doing a google search sent me  urlLink here .  I have been reading ever since.  Through emily's blog, I began reading others and it has grown into a sort of obsession. I like to read what other's write because I realize that while, yes, my life isn't exactly action city (that would be Vegas right?) I still have a little bit to say on some things.  So this blog is in some ways a thank you to emily, and to  urlLink mice  because I didn't even know  urlLink this site  existed.  Although I don't think they know that they are my "inspirations" if you will.  So be sure to visit their sites for some good reading and interesting perspectives on different topics.  I think I will be able to celebrate my one year anniversary with pride and joy and a feeling of accomplishment even if no one actually reads this.

      So today S and I are travelling around town.  We are trying to locate some kinds of underbed drawer systems so we can get rid of our beat to hell dressers and get more space in our room.  While we are driving around we decide that we are tired of our two credit cards that have insanely high interest rates, despite our pleas for them to be lowered.  So we made a somewhat snap decision.  We went to our credit union and asked for a personal load so we could pay off our cards and lose them forever.  Considering that we only needed $8,800 to pay off our cards we were instantly approved.  We got this loan at only 9.99% and will definitively have it paid off in no longer than 60 months. Hooray!  I feel as though a load has been lifted from my shoulders.  The hardest part was, our credit union just cut us a check so that we could put the money where we wanted.  We only use the credit union for our savings and loans, so we wanted to put the check into our checking account at a local bank.  I have $8,800 burning a freaking hold in my pocket.  Damn the bank for not crediting it right now so I can make the necessary electronic payments and be done with the whole thing!

      Have you ever been one of those people who feel that life is passing you by, but you don't really know if you want to reach out and grab hold.  I feel that way sometimes.  I wonder why anyone would want to be in that world, then I realize that I want to be part of everything, only I don't know how to start.  Don't ask me where this came from, just something I blankly wrote then sat back and said...Where the hell did that just come from.  I am suspicious that this blog will be like that a lot.

      So if you are willing to read my blog, you should probably know who the Cast of Characters are that I will reference most often.  My husband shall forevermore be referred to as  S . We have been married for five and a half years and still going strong.  We met in high school and despite the odds are still madly in love.  Our son is to be known as  Shorty , until he finds out about this blog, or grows taller than me.  That probably won't take to long as he is growing like a freakin' weed and is only three and a half.  Then there are the supporting roles of my parents Mimi and PePaw and my inlaws Mimaw and PePaw.  Shorty named them, what can I say.  I also have various other folks who will undoubtedly be included along the way, but I have yet to develop usable names for them.  (read that as things I don't want them to think I think about them should they actually locate this blog).  Of course I probably shouldn't add that part either, but what the hell.

      Why is it that it is the middle of summer and not a bathing suit to be found?  I need to find a one piece, or a tankini, before tomorrow when we head to  urlLink Schlitterbahn .  I made the hideous mistake of purchasing a two piece earlier in the year, and now, I realize the error of my ways.  The result is a woman who will be wearing a bikini when she REALLY shouldn't.  *sigh*  Yep, that'll be me.

      Yes, I know, I left you without a new post for a few days. I have had life happening so that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it! Let me add that my cousin CS is visiting for the week also, so include her on all activites.    Monday/Tuesday    A day full of camping fun.  My first time camping since I was in girl scouts...about 15 years ago or so.  It really was fun.  We played in the lake, taught CS how to dive (she'll be 15 next month), built a campfire, put up our brand new  urlLink tent  (kick ass one isn't it??), cooked dinner (hamburgers) and dessert (S'mores oc course).  Shorty had a hell of a time trying to get to sleep.  I spent the longest night of my life trying to sleep and still have the bad back to show for it.  Next trip will require some type of air bed. Surprisingly Shorty didn't awake with the sun as is his custom, he waited until 8:15 when S got up.  This was nice since I was so damned tired. Unfortunately, Shorty seems to have developed some kind of tear duct infection and has nasty goopy eyes. This will complicate life a little later.  Made our breakfast at our campstove (pepper bacon and eggs).  If you have never tried pepper bacon, I highly recommend it. It is my favorite kind of bacon.  We successfully got our tent repacked into the bag it came out of.  We were really proud of that!  And headed off to go climbing.    Tuesday    Climbing in the greenbelt.  A fun task for any normal group of people, but for S who lives for this stuff (just doesn't get to participate a lot anymore) it was bliss.  That would be until the handhold he was using gave way before he was able to clip into the first safety point.  A 10' fall later and back at home, his foot is killing him.  S goes to the hospital to make sure all is well.  He's now on crutches with a broken foot, a referral to a orthopedist, and some time off work.  Lovely.  Tuesday was fun.    Plus! I missed almost all of  urlLink Amazing Race  because shorty was being such a huge pain in the ass (pita for short).  I gotta hand it to Chip for blazing through that caviar like that.  I like some caviar and cream cheese, but jeez that was a freaking lot of caviar.  So now to today   Wednesday    So now here we are. Shorty slept in until 10am which was a slight relief since he was up so much last night.  Unfortunately that means he is too late to go to daycare today, which means he has missed almost this entire week.  Not good since they are in the process of moving him to the next level up room.  I hope that tomorrow goes considerably better since he will also be out Friday.  Hell, at this point I might as well just keep him home completely, but I'm supposed to meet with his teacher to discuss his progress through the year.    Can things get any worse? I know, I know.  Don't ask.

      I suppose that is a good sign though.&nbsp; Forgetting to post means that I'm not entirely obsessed with blogging. Right?  Anyway, I was out of town visiting family.&nbsp; Informing them I pregnant, when my mom says that I don't have to worry about the timing of the birth, she'll just come here and help take care of the baby until I finish the semester at school.&nbsp; This wouldn't be such a bad offer, but as some others may   urlLink recall , my mom and I don't get along very well after a period of time.  However, I still want her here, so that S doesn't have to take a lot of vacation time (which he has already said he would rather do than have my mom here). *sigh*    Where is that damned life instruction manual?

      No one said that to me, but they probably will in a few months since I just found out that I am pregnant.&nbsp; I will be having a baby around the end of March.&nbsp; This terrifies me to no end, since I will also be in school.&nbsp; The timing could on ly be worse if I was 16.&nbsp; I just can't get happy about this yet.&nbsp; Then again I'm only a few weeks (like 3).&nbsp; If anyone in my family is reading this, please keep your trap shut.&nbsp; We were planning on surprising our parents closer to Christmas (since we were planning on getting pregnant in another 2 months).&nbsp; I wonder if I'll be able to keep it quiet that long.&nbsp; I have almost no one to tell about this.&nbsp; Except you all, S, and an email group I'm in for parents with kids the same age as Shorty.

      The&nbsp;FM&nbsp;radio in my car is now working! Hooray for Pioneer to make the RCA and internal Amp run on different circuits (or whatever the actual way to phrase that is).&nbsp; S might have killed the radio, but it turned out he only killed the internal amp.&nbsp; So all we had to do was go buy an amp hook it up and now I have radio&nbsp; and a CD player too!&nbsp; It's also XM capable, so we will eventually be hooking that up as well.&nbsp; Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!   The car only had&nbsp;AM radio until S bought and hooked up the new radio.&nbsp; The funny part.....the&nbsp;AM doesn't work on the new radio! I just think that is hilarious.

      This is just a question.&nbsp; Not intended to open some huge political discussion.&nbsp; I avoid politics simply because I consider myself not educated enough to hold a real conversation on the topic.&nbsp; So this really is merely a QUESTION.  What is the point of the 9/11 commission?&nbsp; To determine that a mistake (or multiple mistakes if you will) was made?&nbsp; Well, that's all well and good, but what good does it really do?&nbsp; We cannot go back in the past and make changes....this isn't some Orwellian 1984 society we live in.&nbsp; Is hindsight not 20/20?&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining that some mistakes were made is like closing the barn door after the horse got out.&nbsp; There are always mistakes made by one president or another.&nbsp; Something that he may have thought to be right at the time only to learn that he was given false information.&nbsp; Don't try to blame it all on Bush, other presidents have done things that they continue to back even when they are painted into a corner.  For that matter, it certainly isn't only presidents that such things happen to.&nbsp; Did you think that Martha Stewart wouldn't go back and change the past and not sold her ImClone stock now if she could?&nbsp; Of course she would.&nbsp; Everyone makes mistakes, some are just in a more public position and have it displayed to the world to make them look like a total loser.&nbsp;   As far as I'm truly concerned there is no perfect person to run our country since people are not perfect.&nbsp; Until that honest to goodness person out there who isn't hated by the entire country for being better than everyone else is found and is willing to fix our screwed up nation (much like the movie Dave), then there is no reason to trash any one person over another.  That is all I intend to say on the topic.

      Darnit.&nbsp; The team I was most pulling for was eliminated tonight.&nbsp; I don't know why I was pulling for them so much, but I was.&nbsp; Now I suspect that either Chip and Kim or Cami and Carli&nbsp; will end up winning, just because they annoy the hell out of me.   Okay so now I'm rooting for Mirna and Charla though I swear her (Mirna's) whininess is going to make me want to slap her through the tv screen. Mirna at the beginning..."come on Charla this is a race." Like Charla forgot about that on her few hours of sleep she may have gotten.&nbsp; Or maybe the fact that she was in Argentina escaped her consciousness.&nbsp; Silly. Really.  Still a great show though!&nbsp; I cannot believe how into this I get!

      S and I were planning on having ourselves a really nice anniversary this year (our 6th).&nbsp; We were planning on leaving Shorty with his parents and having the weekend all to ourselves.&nbsp; Something we have only done once before with tragedy occurring on our way to my parents house...a whole other post.  &nbsp;  We were planning on staying at a really nice hotel in the middle of Austin and playing stupid teenagers along 6th street, hanging out at really expensive restaurants, and other stuff like that.&nbsp; S was planning on booking the hotel but decided he would contact his parents again to confirm that they'd be willing to watch Shorty.  &nbsp;  Well, wouldn't you know it that my mother-in-law (mil) called the other night and informed me that she and my fil (father-in-law) were planning on a time when we could get together for dinner.&nbsp; I casually brought up the weekend we were planning on our vacation and she told me that they were going out of town and wouldn't be back until Sunday night.  &nbsp;  WTF?!?!&nbsp; But...But...But. *sigh*  So much for our romantic vacation.&nbsp; I didn't remind mil about their prior agreement to watch Shorty for the weekend.&nbsp; Especially since they are going out of town on church business (he's a  urlLink minister ) , but dammit! &nbsp; I'm really disappointed.

      So I get in the car this morning to drive Shorty to daycare.&nbsp; As I pull out of the driveway and onto the street I realize that I can hear the street sounds a bit louder than I should.&nbsp; It turns out that the passenger side front door had not been closed all the way.&nbsp; No sooner do I realize this, than the door comes flying all the way open (I live on the top of a hill) and S's toolbox goes flying out of the car. (He was working on installing my new radio...which stopped working upon installation. Great.) &nbsp; *says under breath* sassafrassashsihihasofieohohaodtihafa &nbsp; Me:Dangit S!&nbsp; You need to check and be sure all the doors are shut.&nbsp; Geez I could so hurt you. *hits the brakes, gets out of the car gets the toolbox and makes sure they are all&nbsp;still&nbsp;inside.&nbsp;tosses them into the car, slams the door, gets back in the car.* &nbsp; Shorty says: What happened Mommy, you scared me.&nbsp; *Shit* &nbsp; Me: Sorry honey, the door came open and daddy's tools came out of the car. I got angry for a moment I'm sorry sweetie. &nbsp; Shorty: Are you going to hurt daddy? &nbsp; Me: *crap* No sweetie, Mommy was just really mad for a minute and I said something I didn't really mean.&nbsp; I'm very sorry for making you worry, I was just angry.&nbsp; Don't worry, Mommy will never hurt Daddy. &nbsp; Shorty: That was scary huh Mom? &nbsp; Me: Yes Sweetie, but its all over now. &nbsp; The End.

       S is a paramedic in a large sized city not far from here.&nbsp; He really likes it (usually) and gets paid very well. If any of you know about paramedicine you would know that as a rule....teachers are paid better.&nbsp; Luckily, S makes a nice enough income that it allows me the privilege of staying home and not having to work while I go to school to get my&nbsp;elusive degree.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   S was born and raised along the coast, while I was raised travelling from Air Force base to Air Force base.&nbsp; So when we moved to central Texas, it was somewhat normal for me and completely foreign to him.&nbsp; So why is it now, that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel (I have two years left before I graduate) that I want so badly to return to the coast and he wants to stay here?     &nbsp;   Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; This area is beautiful.&nbsp; They don't call it the Hill Country for nothin'.&nbsp; However, I would much prefer to be where ALL our friends and nearly all our family is.&nbsp; Why would he want to stay here?&nbsp; I know it isn't because of the money.&nbsp; He isn't like that. Money actually means very little to him.&nbsp; I know it isn't his friends...because we have NONE here.&nbsp; I can't really explain why though.&nbsp; I guess it's because I have nothing in common with majority of my classmates (after all I'm 27, married, and have a son and they are 20 and disillusioned) and S just really prefers a different kind of friendship than one that includes coworkers.     &nbsp;   I would be much happier being where all our friends are.&nbsp; Since he had lived in the same place his whole life, his friends are "childhood friends."&nbsp; Something that I missed out on.&nbsp; I can't imagine him just wanting to see them haphazardly as he passes through town.&nbsp; I think perhaps I'm reading to much into this desire to stay put.&nbsp; Whatcha think?

I must have nice pretty shiny things, like diamonds that usually come on GOLD.&nbsp; But it's okay, I can deal because now there is PLATINUM.&nbsp; Now if I can just convince S that I need something big and shiny set in platinum.   &nbsp;  Sadly, however, this wretched illness also leaves me horribly disfigured.&nbsp; I cannot wear earrings.&nbsp; (Oh how I wish I could wear earrings...I HATE CLAIRES.)&nbsp; I have never even tried them in platinum though. I wonder if that would work. Hmmmm.&nbsp; I look at my cousin who is 14 and she wears the cutest earrings.&nbsp; Long dangly ones, chandelier style, cute little barely there types.&nbsp; I envy a 14 year old.

      Recently,  urlLink Zam  had a  urlLink post  that referenced  urlLink Merriam Webster's  top ten list of favorite words.  I have been working on including these words into normal conversation, because I can.  Also, I would like to add how much of a nerd I am, because I actually  wrote these words on to index cards with their definitions .  Yep, that's just me.  The sweet adorable nerd. Okay, fine, just the nerd then.   When I was fighting with my Mom, I never wanted to  urlLink defenestrate  someone that badly before in my life.   After my son was born, I developed a case of  urlLink callipygian .   Are you completely  urlLink discombobulated  yet?   I am often an unusual  urlLink plethora  of knowledge, while being somewhat  urlLink plethoric .   That's right, Plethora has two completely different meanings! I bet you didn't know that. I actually had to look up words for the second definition of plethora.  I feel so smart now.   urlLink Zam  strikes me as a  urlLink flibbertigibbet .   I really liked the movie  urlLink Serendipty .  It was such a sweet movie.   After having a fight, one really looks all  urlLink kerfuffle .   I am not a  urlLink persnickety  person, though I may come off as such at times.   I only watched old Batman shows for the  urlLink onomatopoeia  moments.   This is list is not  urlLink juxtaposed , it is actually the opposite.   There ya go! All ten of Merriam-Webster's favorite words for 2004.  Who knew that flibbertigibbet is really a word that one can use.  I always thought it was just a made up word.   Things that make you say, hmmmmmm.

      I have come to realize that I have a severe illness.  Yep, I cannot walk past a computer without feeling an overpowering desire to check blogs, check my email, and post about something.  Does this mean I will be slowing down on my posting??  Not intentionally.  I am aware I posted A LOT yesterday, but today I really have nothing to blog about.  This really bugs me.  I like posting.  I like making sure my (wonderful) readers have something to read. So at this time, I will allow a list to be made.  Please feel free to comment about stuff you would like to see me blog about.  I might not do it today or tomorrow, but I will likely keep it in reserve for when I run out of other material.......like today.  That is all.

      This follows my  urlLink post  about the fight with my mom.  So Sunday morning, S, Shorty and I are heading out of the house to go see people.  My mom hasn't really spoken to me civilly since Friday night.  I forgot to mention how that much later that evening I went into her room, hugged her, and told her that I loved her.  I got no response.  Anyway, Sunday morning,  I go to say bye to my mom when she hugs me and tells me that she is sorry.  She apologized for getting so angry and tells me that she hates that as she gets older she is becoming more and more like her mother (the schizophrenic).  I simply told her that I still love her, she is still a good mom, and that perhaps she needs to try and stop acting on her anger and try talking about things instead.  This, after all, is what I usually do so as to avoid becoming my mother. (I didn't tell her this, do you think I have a death wish or something???)  I appreciate that she offered to me an apology.  But I don't really feel that she was being sincere.  I think she was doing it to try and appease me and make me happy.  I'm not dense.  My dad once informed me after a slighter similar, albeit less physical, fight with my mom, that she has never once apologized to him and that I am lucky to receive one at all.  But, I would rather some other token, than an empty, Or Worse, pity laden apology.  She apologizes to avoid having me write her off.  She doesn't want to feel alienated from me, so she will apologize for her actions and words.  Only, I know that what she is apologizing for is herself.  She is only doing it to keep me around and to keep me from finding ways to remove her from my life.  I think what she thinks is that, as long as she says she's sorry, then whatever she is sorry for is water under the bridge.  But, if she can't find it within herself to apologize to anyone else, why should I be the one to receive them?  Because I am her flesh and blood and her first born.  She always told me that while, yes, you will love all of your children, there is always something special about your first.  I doubt that when she is apologizing, she is apologizing to the full extent of the definition.  I think she is doing it solely for herself and not so much for me.  So, while I may tell her I accept her apology, I find it difficult to really accept her apology.  She never really seems to try and make up for it.  She never apologizes for her behavior then attempts to make herself better.  She just uses her apologies as an excuse to herself that everything will be fine once again.  I can assure you all that everything will not be fine once again. Once you actually have a physical confrontation with your Mom, things will never be the same.

      It's almost 5pm and I'm still in my pajamas. Go ahead and hate me, but it's only because I'm doing laundry and have no clean clothes. Okay, well, I do now, but I don't feel like putting them on at this point. Seems silly to me.   I'm also still in my p.j.s because Shorty stayed home from day care today. The poor sleepy child slept until 10AM!!! Geez. Clearly our "vacation" wasn't restful for anyone.

      Okay, so Friday night we are out at dinner with my family.  Something my entire family has been doing (at the same restaurant) for about 5 years now.  (Shorty actually has a plate named after him!! How cool is that!)  My mom was drinking copiuous amounts of Margaritas.  She and alcohol don't mix well usually, but this time just seemed to be worse since she is currently weaned off almost all of her medication to "control" her moods.  (She's not diagnosed bi-polar, but without meds she sure seems to be)  My dad, S, and I were sitting around the kitchen having a good time, when suddenly my mom starts yelling something about how it's fine, just go ahead and laugh.  Don't tell her what we are talking about.  She wasn't even in the damned room. How are we supposed to know she wants to be "in" on any conversation when she isn't even in the effing room with us. (also, this was following my dad announceing my blog to the family, something else she's pissed about...that he knew and she didn't).  S took Shorty to put him to bed (that's right, she's doing this in front of a 3 year old... don't  get me started on that!) and then my mom walked into the kitchen, goes to my dad and says "I hate you sometimes."  I didn't hear the sometimes part. She leaves the room and my dad and I look at each other with a WTF expression. I mean seriously....WTF!!!  Hate is a really strong word and to use that word with your spouse whom (who?) you are supposed to really love? So I went to talk to her.  I no sooner walk in the bedroom door that she starts yelling at me. I'm not the enemy dammit.  She agrees...hesitantly and while still yelling...too talk to dad and I.  (S is still with Shorty, trying to get him to sleep).  She walks into the kitchen. Yells at me and my dad to "SIT DOWN"..."YOU WANT TO TALK THEN SIT DOWN DAMMIT."  Well if that isn't going to invoke calm and rational conversation.  Then she is all pissy when we her don't talk to us like that.  I try to explain to her that no one likes being yelled at like a DOG when trying to understand why someone is upset.  I go to walk away and she THROWS a GLASS with her drink in it at me.  "O NO SHE DI'IN"  Yes, she did.  I turned around and charged her.  I can't believe that I did it and I apologized for it later, but again, WTF. I grabbed her and told her "don't you ever fucking do that to me again." She buckles like a newborn foal. I'm trying to make sure she doesn't fall hard when she digs her nails into my arm (this is my wound) and then starts holding herself up while hanging from my hair (which didn't hurt by the way).  I told her and dad that we will be staying in a hotel thank you very much and I go to get Shorty (who heard everything) and S.  W pack and go to leave.  She is in her truck trying to leave. The rest is really not important to the story.  I think I'll post the ending to this story when I have calmed down because just talking (writing) about it is making me angry.  I need to breath.  S says he thinks that perhaps I ought to find someone to talk to about this, after all I was accosted and by my own mother none the less.  I figure just a little more venting and I'll be all right.  I have the insurance and stuff, but I don't want to relive this over and over again which is what I learned is usually done when you experience something "traumatic."  Kind of a desensitiazion process. Opinions?   Some Clarification :  1.  I need to add that my mom was drinking a soda (or as I usually say for all forms of soda a "coke"), not any other form of alcohol, except what she had at dinner a few hours prior.  2.  My mom has been weaned off her meds by her psychiatrist to prepare her for an intensive psychotherapy program she is heading for this coming weekend.  Thanks to  urlLink Kalisa  for bringing these overlooked and important aspects to my attention.

      Anyone.  Did anyone make the transition to my new blog?  I miss my readers.  *sigh*  I can share a story about a mean evil mother, her sweet innocent daughter and the fight that occurred between them.  Seriously, I actually have a physical wound from her.  My first ever.  It pissed me off to no end.  I swear sometimes.......  I better not finish that sentence.  Anyway, Tonight is also the second installment of my current favorite show, the  urlLink Amazing Race 5 .  So pathetically into that show that I actually get excited when I talk about it.  I really think that I need to get a new form of life, but really, WHY?  This one is so simple and predictable, yet full of excitement at times (I   did   say that my mom caused me a physical wound after all).  Apparently, today at 12:30 pt/3:30 et you can "Chat Live with Host Phil Keoghan"  Special.  I might be into the show, but certainly not that much.......yet.  Anyway, to my current readers. Thank you for remaining.  I hope to build a new following soon.  Hah! I'm so full of ... something.

      Thank goodness that tomorrow I get to return to my home, and my regularly scheduled blogging.  I really dislike having to be "sneaky" about my blogging so as to avoid having any family members come and read over my shoulder and shit like that.  I mean Jeez! I'm not a child on the computer, I'm an adult doing whatever the hell I want to.  Back the Fuck Off already.  So I thank you all for your patience.  I will be blogging more regularly and less in the middle of the night so as to escape prying eyes.  Then, I will never speak of this again.  I have had less than 12 hours of sleep in since Thursday night.  I am so fucking tired that I am using profanity like a sailor.  I, generally, avoid cursing because Shorty picks it up much to easily.  I should also note that I am having a severe problem typing right now and cannot keep my thoughts straight.  I will now go to bed, and will leave this house to shop at  urlLink Ikea  before heading to normalcy (is that even a word?).  Thanks for sticking around during the turmoil.  I will certainly do my best to leave all the drama behind me and soon!

      Since I'm currently visiting with my parents I cannot post about some stuff that I normally would. Particularly the fight that resulted after my mom found out that my dad knew I had a blog and she didn't.  Bullshit all of it.  I swear it was a days of our lives moment and my mom was Jan Spears (psycho..much?).  I thank all of you who are still willing to read me despite the moving of the blog.  Thanks so much.  Anyway, right now we are painting a room in my parents house for Shorty and my nephew D.  I have never painted a room before and I never realized just how much work was really entailed in doing so.  I didn't know that I ever needed to "cut in" before I actually painted the wall.  So when I managed to get a section of the freshly painted ceiling blue, my dad about flipped.  But, he was okay with it.  I think he still feels guilty and a little paint mishap isn't nearly as bad as what he did to me.  While I could continue to post, shorty has gotten himself into trouble.  More Later,

      I really hated having to move my blog, but I really didn't want my family to read about me.  I don't need their criticisms and such.  Also, I don't want to post about them, and not know as to whether they would read it or not. Ya know?  So anyway, now that it is the butt-crack of dawn.  I will head off to bed feeling a bit better about no one in my family being aware of this site..except S.  He's the only one. Ever.   I hope

      I have an entire house to finish cleaning and 30 minutes to do it in.  SHIT.  I usually don't have a problem, but I was cleaning up my computer table and bumped the keyboard drawer which moved the mouse which woke up my monitor which was calling me to get online.    I love run-on sentences.  So now, here I am checking out my blog and others and trying to get my ass away from the conmputer so I can vacuum before I pick up Shorty from daycare and get ready to leave for our family vacation to the gulf coast and the Houston area.  Yay.  I love four hour drives with a three year old.  Thank Goodness for our travel DVD player!   UPDATE:  While I didn't get everything done, I did get almost everything done.  I won't be totally embarrassed for my friend to come to the house while I'm gone.  Now I just need to go hide the porn. ;)

      I now can say that I comprehend how it is that some people are "self taught" site builders.  It really isn't all that difficult as long as you know what the different things are that you want to do.  Of course...isn't that the case for everything?  Really though, I'm starting to understand how it is that people start in the business of website building.  I am acutally finding the different things about it fun.  I feel a sense of accomplishment when I realize that a new link on the sidebar was something I installed myself.  Ahhh...here it is.....my moment of Zen.

      I have such an awesome spouse.  He let me watch TV  urlLink (the Amazing Race 5) , while he did the dishes, got Shorty ready for bed, and did some laundry. He really is awesome!  I just have to comment about how great he his and how much I appreciate him.  Don't worry, I told him how much I appreciate him and how awesomely fabulous he is already.  But just in case he needs it in writing.......  S, you are the most awesomely fantastic man in the world. I love you.  Awwww...professions of love that make others want to vomit.  Is there anything more special?

      That is a hypothetical question.  After reading a post by  urlLink Joelle  entitled "20 Questions to a Better Personality" I decided to take the  urlLink quiz .  Here is the result:   20 Questions to a Better Personality  Wackiness: 52/100 Rationality: 50/100 Constructiveness: 52/100 Leadership: 28/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.       Now I read the "nice" spin they put on the title of SEDF - but really it just sounds like I am a pathetic boring person who tends to be a follower and is emotionally destructive.  Although I do agree with the last sentence.  Do not mess with me, I  will  explode.

      For some reason this particular posting site seems to be having trouble.  I cannot see my blog or anyone else who has a blogspot blog. I find this irritating and it makes me ready to just set out on my own.  But not yet.  I will be considering it though.  That is all.   UPDATE:  The problem I was having was actually with my particular firewall.  It seemed to think that suddenly any blogger site was bad and banned them all.  The problem has since been rectified.  Thank goodness.  I'm really not ready to set out on my own.

      I love the ballet.  I love everything about the ballet.  As a former dancer (of the ballet...not exotic), I always find that I cannot get enough of seeing other people doing something I would have liked to do.  I had my opportunity once.  I was supposed to attend an audition at a prestigious  urlLink arts school , but unfortunately, the day of my audition my dad was sick and couldn't take me.  I really wonder what would have happened to me, and where I would be, if I could have gone.  I also wonder sometimes if my dad was really sick.  Either way, now, since I no longer dance, I like to attend the ballet.  I intend to take Shorty when he gets older.  I don't expect him to like it, but I want him to at least have an appreciation for it.  That way, in thirty years, he can take his wife without argument.  Such a great mother-in-law I will be some day FAR FAR FAR into the future.

      If you are ever in Austin, I highly recommend checking out  urlLink Curra's Grill .  I went there tonight for the first time and Wow was it ever good.  Yum, I could so eat there again, right now. I highly recommend the Enchiladas Chiapas.   I'm drooling just thinking about it right now!

      I have to thank  urlLink Rose  for giving the best explanation for missing items in the dryer.  This notification followed a comment I left on  urlLink Joelle's  site to her post "Free Range".  Anyway, here is Rose's response.   Re: Gretchen’s comment, many years ago I heard a FABULOUS explanation for the socks in the dryer syndrome.  1) God is omnipotent.  2) Therefore, God must see, hear, and know all things.  3) Under the “if a tree falls in the woods and there’s no one there to hear it” theory, in essence if God no longer had knowledge of something, it would cease to exist.  POOF!  4) While the socks are spinning around really fast in the dryer, God occasionally loses track of one of them.  5) POOF!  And then occasionally God will remember that one sock, which is why you sometimes find them two weeks later under your bed.   This explains so much!

      Can anyone explain to me, in fairly simple terms, what pinging is and why people use it?  Also, is trackback the same thing?  Is having this on one's site a useful thing?  Please email me at gretchenn@gmail.com and let me know. I really am curious as to what the whole point of it is.  Also, if anyone can tell me how to make my email a click on link, that would be really helpful also. I only ask because I realized that  urlLink this  doesn't work.  Thanks in advance.

      Today they came to take the  urlLink mustang . The new owners I mean. I'm really going to miss that stupid car, but I'm also really glad that it is finally out of my driveway.  At least now there is room to park the other cars and not look like I own a junk yard or mini car dealership.  I'm just a posting fool tonight aren't I?

      I am starting to experiment with template stuff.  Very minor to start.  I added a links section to the right.  These links are very rudimentary, so don't expect much of anything.  Shorty's page used to be better, but I let it go.  I had to recreate a new one so his will take time.  As for the other one. I forgot I even had that page until just a little bit ago.  I have since been messing with that as well.  I anticipate some decent sites sometime before I turn...well, sometime before I die.  Just thought I'd share.  I hope to educate myself enough to create myself a whole new template and everything.  This will take some time though.

      My day consisted of sitting on the couch reading (and finishing!) my book and doing laundry.  I really had nothing happen today worth blogging about.  So I tried to think of something to blog about.  I think I figured it out.  Why are most guys so into thongs and g-strings?  Is there something so special about a woman wearing this style of "underwear?"  Sure they serve a great purpose when you want no panty lines, but what makes them so special to have an entire market dedicated to them?  I know that S seems to find them incredibly enticing, and as a woman who has had a child, I can assure you that my body isn't as it once was.  Certainly not what I would consider "thong" capable.  And yet he continues to purchase and try to convince me to wear these things.  I admit that on occasion I will wear them; usually they make me feel like I'm...what's the right word...sexy, I guess.  But I just don't get the allure.  You might as well not be wearing anything.    OH  WAIT A SEC.    I think I just figured it out.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Perhaps the allure is that there is still some part that isn't revealed, but more is shown than, say "granny panties."  I suppose that would make some sense.  I still don't think I will ever understand it though. Anyone?

      I really like living in Texas.  It has become home to me over the years of moving all over the country.  However, I have one huge complaint.  It's Fucking HOT.  Thank goodness it is the middle of August, which means that summer will be over in about.......four more months.  The hottest time of the year is usually August to September.  Have you seen the commercial where the guy starts melting into the concrete getting to a soda machine (can't rememer which soda).  It's kinda like that, only without the refreshment of some soda to cool one off.  The only thing offered here is a river that is way to effing cold to play in.  It's really irritating.  It's to hot to go outside, but the one place to go outside and play is to cold.  Screwed up if you ask me.  I think I'll just stay inside of my climate controlled home and pretend that it isn't hot when I go outside to do my laundry (where my laundry room is...ugh).  Can I get an AMEN from my fellow Texans and other southerners?

      *shrugging shoulder*  I just don't get it.  I knew that yesterday was Tuesday.  I successfully managed to completely miss  urlLink The Amazing Race !  Dammit.  I really wanted to see the Moms come back from nothing.  After reading about the show on their site, I clearly missed a really good episode. Damn. I think I might just have to set a timer or something next week. I'm really dissappointed to have missed it. *sigh*  Damned "quick trip" to the grocery store.

      This is a call out for any "morning" sickness gurus or those who know one. I don't intend to make this blog about my pregnancy in anyway. If I want to do that, I'll start a new one. However, the fact that I feel so much like shit right now makes me feel it necessary to cry for help. Anyone who knows of anyway to limit (or even eliminate) the wretched feeling of morning sickness, please let me know. I hate feeling like this. I'm actually having to carry barf bags that S  stole  procured from the station (as you may recall, he's a paramedic).  Please. Help. Me.  *sobbing in corner....awaiting a response*     UPDATE:   Thanks to the suggestions offered by sexysoccamom and Kalisah, I have begun feeling better.  I appreciate the suggestions and the well wishes from everyone!!!  :)

      Owie.  Owie.  Owie.  Too much sun is bad for the skin.  Forgetting your sunscreen when you know that too much sun is bad for your skin results in pain.  And a fair amount of it.  I was only out for a little while, but the sun knew I was there and felt it necessary to remind me to NEVER again forget the sunscreen.  That's what I get.  The lectures may begin.

      I try to deny it all I want.  I want to pretent that it isn't true.  How can it possibly be true.  There's nothing there to keep me around.  I really don't think it is any kind of problem that can be solved.  And yet, I continue to feel a desire, a need if you will, to find something to blog about.  I'm not addicted.  I don't care what S says.  I just like having a place to write about anything and knowing that people other than myself and S (and any family members) find me interesting.  If they didn't they wouldn't continue to read me. Right?  So, I'm not addicted, just a rambling pile of skin and bones.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled blogging.

      Well, at least ours does.  S broke his foot a week ago today, he still has been unable to get in to see an orthopedist in order to have it properly checked out and to determine a course of action.  Why is this?  The insurance company will not accept the referral order written by the ER doctor and only wants one from our PCP.  We went to the PCP on THURSDAY and he still hasn't gotten a referral to see the fucking orthopedist.  Such a load of bullshit.  My husband has a fucking BROKEN FOOT and can't get in to see the doctor to get it fixed because of a bunch of bullshit loopholes that the fucking insurance company has him jumping through.  Assholes.

      After a long week of feeling like I've been neglecting you all, I am now home with no concerns of leaving you in the lurch for a little while.  This last weekend S, Shorty and I took my cousin, CS, back home to Houston.  We would have just let my Aunt and Uncle come get her, but it was necessary for us to take her so that we could visit with my Uncle B who just returned from his tour in Turkey.  He has been in the Air Force for about 18 years now, and just spent the last 5 years in Turkey as some kind of body guard/personal assistant to one of the higher up generals.  Now he gets to return to the US and eventually retire from the AF.  It was great to see B.  He's not much older than I am and is like the missing child in our family.  Everyone is happier when he comes to visit.  Now that he will be in the states again (N. CA), we are happy to know that we will be able to go visit him occasionally also.  I will have to post more later, I need to take Shorty to day care. He starts his new classroom today which is twice the size of his last classroom.  I can't tell if he is excited or not yet.  Time will tell.  More to be posted later today.
