      HEHE! just shifted from blogdrive. blogdrive is giving me as a hard time. cannot stand it anymore so decided to give this a try! well! Today found out that i flunk 3 subjects, Add math, E math and Social studies. IT was so bad. Plus today i am suppose to go for the sandwich making competition, but turns out zhaohing and me we do not have any ingredients with us and it starts at 2pm, which is the time our class ends. NO time to buy the ingredients, so decided to not go. And in the morning, went to school still feeling giddy and blur. Went to the biology lab straight after flag raising. Found out that the Stupid Yongyee was counting everybody's marks! STUP UP PLEASE! YOU already know you are the top! SO SHUT YOUR TRAP OKAY? keep going around announcing you are the top and provoking people. Your results may be good, but your character stinks, it is no wonder you got a D for your CME. I hate you! everytime i see you, i thought i am seeing a walking stick insect walking around the class... And thank you very much to the person who brought the mark sheet home! YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO BRING IT HOME UNDERSTAND! MRS TOH DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU BEING INCHARGE OF IT! SICK MAN! Do you mind respecting other people privacy?? huh? met mr loh while me and meiqing were about to go home! he gave us really good advice man! really the best teacher i ever met! For my math teacher, sigh... speechless... i agree tt we did not work hard enough... but for our class... sigh again... SOMEBODY HELP US!!! I AM REALLY STRESSED ABOUT EVERYTHING, even though it is after the exam and i thought tt i can finally relaxed, but no. The ELDDS DRAMA IS DRIVING ME KUKU! KUKU! I am acting as a typical singaporean father who cares about nothing but soccer... and i most of the time i am on stage eating potato chips and facing the audience. GREAT! REALLY SICK MAN! MY ACTING SKILL IS not up to that level yet! and the sight of tt arrogant bastard really drive me nuts... tt Jien... FINE! i know you can act well! but wipe tt look of your face okay! i just wanna get this over! i am acting because i enjoy it! and i don't care what others think! so to hell with ya! OKAY! my bitching session is over for today! please tune in to FIANL FANTASY FEVER! haha! joking! thanks! feeling much better! hhehehe! :P
