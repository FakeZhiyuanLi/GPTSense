That sucks hella bad and my favorite teacher Chief aint coming that is the worst. Well tomorrow I find out that I got a D I'm geometry no I don't know yet but I think that I got a D cause that test was supa hard.  I got xbox live last weekend it's one of the greatest things in the world but what I need is but Counter Strike the best online first person shooter till Halo 2 comes out. I must also  say that why does techtv have all the best looking women Morgan Webb, Laura Swisher, Jessica Corbin, Catherine Schwartz. Well talk to ya in a whenever.

      I have Xbox and A PS2 on but I don't have them online and I was thinking. I'm not using them for every thing that they can do. I mean its great to have them but I want to take them online. But here is the upside I have a income tax check coming in the next few week and then I will be on line and I will be the happiest person in the world. I mean what is the best way for me to sit in my room for eight hours and talk trash to some one in New York I mean what else would I want to do. Well I gotsta get rollin

      Well it's about two days till I leave for the trip and I'm hella hype I cant wait also I got my report card today and I found out that I passed every thing so I get to go on the Jeff city Bike Club trip. I haven't said much about this trip because I didn't want to get my self a lil to hype before I found out what my grades were but now that I know what they are I know that I will talk about it a lot. Also it's 4 weeks after the D.C. trip so I will have a lot of stuff to do till the next trip. So like a week before  I have to get all my homework and do it in Herman and in Jeff City. We are gonna ride there on out there we stark in St. Charles out by the Casino and we go till Herman the first day then the second day we ride till we hit Jeff city. But before all of that I have to pay $80 dollars that is some Bull spit.

      Well the weather in  St.louis Has been wild it has rained every day  this week and my parents want us to go on some dumbass trip to Branson. Well I think that it's bull I could really care less about going to branso again there is nothing new the only thimg I wanna do is ride the go-karts. and buy a new knife the only thing this does is it makes me have to stay at school caue i wanted to leave early cause I dont want to see the talent show cause it's a hella fun( for u dumb asses i was being sarcastic). I went back to the YMCA today and went to my favorite class and I can finally jog.  I couldn't jog or run because I broke my toes from riden a motorcycle. I'm thinkin I'm gonna skip and go home and get yelled at for skiping.

      Well I did have to pay for that bike trip cause 3 weeks before I broke my wrist. That was bull I had to stay at home. But the worst part was that I lost all the musle in my arm. So one is all big and toned and the other looks like a womans arm and that just sucks. But I still get to go on my trip to scott afb

      Really Bad Memories Hey I was just playin Fight Night 2004 and I was thinkin about these people that I just couldn't STAND I mean these dudes got on my nervs every day that I went outside they would play wit me and my poeoples and they would just piss me off every fuckin day. Cause they would try to bully them around and I have a big problem wit bullys. So alot of the time we didn't get along. So one day I was talkin to my pops and he was like if they mess wit u just kick the shit out of them. So for the longest I was like gimme a fuckin reason do sommin. They would do a damn thing to me cause I had em runnin scared and Then there was this one day we was chillin in my friend's Antwan's pool and they came in his yard messin with us. So I was like can u guys leave and then they started messin with us so I chased him out of his yard .  And twan was chasen his lil bro and then His momma gone come out and start screamn at us bou some stupid ass shit  and cause twan threw a rock at him but here is the thing the rock was tiny cause twan  aint strong and he aint no taller than 3"11 and he hit him  and he was showin her this tiny ass bruse and she said u stay here I'm callin the police. I sadi o shit and i ran so fast down to my house u would think a dog was chasen after me. To ennd this off i didn't get i trouble caue they didn know where i lived and I was runnin scared for a wile i didn't want to go past there house cause the momma was a bitch.
