						   As promised, here's the next instalment of bus mongs.  I bet you've been looking forward to this, haven't you...   2. Bus Monitors  Now, in every walk of life, in every profession, in every place where humans exist there are heirachies.  I accept these heirachies with varying degrees of grace.  But, if there is one thing that makes me want to stick two fingers up to "The Man" and form a rock n' roll band, it's people who assume importance and status without any requirement for them to exist.  I have to be careful here to convey exactly what I mean.  I want you to understand.  Two elderly women on my bus service have elected themselves bus monitors.  As far as I know, there was never any formal nomination.  Let's be clear; these people have assumed the position of bus lords.  This basically involves:  a)  Sitting right behind the driver and shouting conversations at him in a "spirit of the blitz" style dialect.   Eg: "Ooh 'ello Frank, I 'ope you'll be putting yer foot down today, my Bert's expecting his dinner!".   Essentially, mindless, insiduous prattle.  The volume at which these conversations take place cow everyone around them into aural submission.  No-one can read, listening to music is impossible, and quiet chats with friends are verboten.  Essentially, this is an exercise in illustrating that they are friends with the driver, and so assume some of the importance they crave by association.  They rarely look around or even notice other bus people, the bus people they nominally claim to represent.  b) Getting on the bus first.  This is truly the raison d'etre of the bus monitor.  They force themselves, elbows and handbags flailing, onto the buses first for three reasons.  Firstly, this (again) gives them the air of importance and status that they crave.  Secondly, getting on the bus first gives them first choice of seats - they can then position themselves in prime bus real estate for loud driver conversations.  Thirdly, this allows them to have protracted chats with the driver, and fumble for their tickets whilst a large queue stretches back outside getting drenched in the rain.   c)  On the rare occasions where a new driver has been in place (I always feel great sympathy for these hapless footsoldiers, thrust naively onto the battlefield), bus monitors enter a state of heightened awareness.  Not content with shouting often unnecessary directions into the side of the driver's head, they will also offer information on who normally gets on at those stops, whether to wait for them if they aren't there and other classified, bus-monitor-priveleged information.  MI5 themselves would have dossiers less detailed on members of the Taliban.  d) On the rarer still occasions where the bus makes a wrong turning, the bus monitors become a flurry of activity.  "Wrong way!" they shout, whilst looking around incredulously at fellow passengers, as if the driver had defaced a war memorial.  e) Bus monitors are the guardians of bus protocol.  Although they can blatantly disregard other passengers, any kind of ignorance on the part of other passengers is met with disapproving looks.  Any breach of accepted protocol, whether or not you have ever been in this country before, been on a bus before, have the use of your arms and legs etc is met with their clear disgust.    Wedged into their seats with their old-woman paraphanelia, these are actually quite sad individuals.  I can only imagine the voids in their lives must have become slightly less yawning when they found solace in bossing people about on buses.  In two years of bus usage, I have yet to see them justify their self-appointed positions, and on top of it all, they clearly enjoy this.  They act like they are doing me a favour.  If getting on my nerves and stinking of Parma Violets is somehow helping me, I can only marvel at what my shortcomings must have been to start with.  Perhaps I was too relaxed and the bus didn't smell of Parma Violets enough.  We can but wonder.  This is just a small sample of the irritations that these people cause, and for once, I am not just saying that because I can't think of anything else.  It really is just a small sample.

						         In case any of you people care, I am one of the hardy souls of this world who commute to work.  Yes, I get the bus.  And I like it.  In fact, a 30-45 minute journey in the morning is an unbelievably relaxing way to get to work.  In a carefully temperature controlled cocoon, you can pop a bit of music on and watch the scenery, leaving all the actual "doing" to someone else.  Namely the driver.  It's difficult to convey the benefits of merely sitting, doing nothing, on an adequately comfortable seat, and not having to worry about anything for half an hour.   This is, in theory, superb.  However, my idyll in this metal tube with wheels is frequently tested by putrid invaders.  Invaders of the worst kind.  Space invaders, if you like.  I have attempted to categorise them in a new series, starting below.  All users of public transport will identify them.  And though they have many names, their presence is unmistakable.    1.  The feckless youngster.  Yesterday a regular user of my bus service, a feckless young girl, brought into sharp focus why I hate other bus people so much.  Perhaps I should avoid the term "bus people", as this either suggests a gypsy-like existence in an abandoned bus, or people who actually resemble buses.  Either way, it's not what I am trying to say.  Basically, I shall now define "bus people" as people who get the bus, in order to avoid confusion.  Anyway, her crimes against me are myriad and serious.  In an international court of bus law (ICBL) she would probably be tried and sentenced to death.   We have a distinct history.  It all started when, about 18 months ago, this individual started to wait at my stop.  Looking little different from the usual slack-jawed windowlickers of my home town, I paid little heed, instead assuming my favourite bus-waiting position of roughly perpendicular to the shelter in order to look up the hill, legs heroically akimbo like the Collossus of Rhodes.  I was somewhat surprised when she boarded the private vehicle which takes me to work.  Perhaps I had misjudged her, despite her appearance and demeanour.   A few weeks passed with respectful silence between us.  All was well, and I felt we had formed an invisible bond of ignoring eachother.  But then, a terrible thing happened. One day, she approached the bus stop, and I was unfortunate enough to momentarily lock eyes with her.  This, as most people would doubtless know, is a pre-cursor to some kind of conversation.  To my alarm, I had discovered that my mouth was open as well.  Snapping it shut, I did my best to rescue the situation.  I noticed that something was different about her... something was amiss.  My mind raced to pin it down.  Of course! Her hair.  She had dyed her hair.    "I like your hair" I said, before the full disastrous impact of what I had done hit me.   I had sparked up a conversation with a bus person!  No more louche days reading in the window seat, listening to the latest grooves.  No more beautiful days watching the speeding countryside.  I would be sucked in, engulfed in this desperate harlot's whirlygig of hair chat.  Maybe the whole situation would escalate to shopping, or worse, work.  Oh cruelest of all fates!!! Why?  Why did my tongue forsake me, when I most needed it to stop it's diabolical dance!  "Oh, thanks, I only di...."  By this time I had run onto the bus.  I couldn't risk more contact or possible friendship with this woman.  She would doubtless destroy what little peace I could wrestle from my day.  More would come of this, I was sure, and indeed it did.  An insidious campaign of irritation followed.  Once, the bus arrived ridiculously early, and we both missed it.  An uncomfortably long period of waiting ensued, before it was clear that no bus would be coming.  I was forced by the situation to offer a non-commital "I think we've missed it".  She rudely turned her back and stormed off, frantically jabbing at her mobile phone.  As we were both bound for the same destination, and we had both missed the same bus, a nice gesture would have been to offer a place in the lift she was undoubtedly arranging (although I would have turned her down on principle).  Instead she glared at me as if I had somehow Karmically arranged the absence of the bus in order to ruin her day.    This week alone, of the 5 days which are busable, she has neglected to have a ticket on 3 days.  This is not only gyppo behaviour, but is also an embarrassing social situation, which I seek to avoid at all times.  All 3 times, she has been "let off" the fare, which has only exponentially increased my contempt for her.  Then there's the running.  I get on the bus first, due to clever kerbside positioning.  She gets on immediately afterwards, and I swear she runs directly behind me, hurrying me along.  I feel obliged to hurl everything into the seat and dive out of her way.  Why she feels the need to hurtle up the bus is a mystery to all except me.  To me, it is but more evidence of her idiocy.    It's clear she thinks she is the J-Lo of the bus community.  Well she got her commupance today alright.  As the bus drew near, some schoolchildren passed us.  Their cries of "She's got a Â£2 handbag!" were delight to my ears as they systematically humiliated my self-important co-busee, who dresses like someone doing an impression of a character from Sex in the City down on their luck.  Other times the bus has pulled away, as she frantically runs behind it, and I have merely sat, smiling smugly.  Oh, good will have it's days.  But such are the cosmic forces of yin and yan that my victories are only part of a timeless struggle.  One which must be won at all costs.

						    They're Good, but Let's Not Start Any Wars Over Them   Well, in a new section of the page, I look at music and decide whether it's any good, for the benefit of you, the reader.  I will call it "My Opinion on Music".  Or "Reviews".  Yeah, that one.       Well, Franz Fedinand (or "The 'Nand" as I haven't christened them) are a Scottish indie type outfit.  That doesn't do them justice - "Indie" is used far too loosely nowadays to have any real meaning.  In this instance, let's take it to mean that they are progressive and slightly non-conformist. What's their sound like? I'll tell you.  They owe a big debt to Tom Verlaine and Television.  That kind of skewed funkiness cut through with some melodious guitar work and bass lines.  Then, in other instances, lead singer Alex Kapranos sounds like a more coquetteish Ian Curtis.  Either way, the mix spells funky and the music spells good. There's flashes of Iggy Pop's The Idiot in the density of some of the tracks, flashes of The Pixies in the pop-artful approach to lyrics.  Bizzarely, some parts of the album also recall Blondie at their Parallel-Lines zenith.  You work it out.  I can't be bothered. I've read and heard comparisons to "The 'Werk" (Kraftwerk).  This is pretty crass on the surface - there's snatches of German on some tracks, which is probably the main reason for the comparisons.  However, having said that, there is an undercurrent of a peculiarly teutonic baroque.  Difficult to pin down, but themes like darkened cinemas and dancing with men called Michael conjure a particularly Weimar atmosphere, in my mind at least. So we've established that their influences are a smorgasbord of left-field  artists.  But what is the driver that make The Nand stand out? Well there are moments of adreneline pumping brilliance.  The type that makes you want to go out and have a fight or run really fast, like all the best music does.  The opener "Jacqueline" is a multi-layered romp which displays a joy for words and sound which is refreshing.  It's slightly self-consciously skewed - it's not full-on absurdity, but has kind of taken a toffee hammer and tapped the norm hard enough to make it less normal.  Rhyming "spectacles" with "erecticles" is one such example.  The barnstorming chorus, which extols the virtues of holidaying is another.  A well rounded debut, all in all, but as a friend said to me after the Stroke's first album - "Where do they go from here?".  They might have just painted themselves into a corner by releasing something so polished so soon. Time will tell, but until that time tells, don't go assassinating any Archdukes.

						   I can't think of anything to write today, so this is going to go one of two ways.  Either I will turn this into an entertaining missive on not being able to write anything, or it will just grind to a halt, teetering precariously on the keep/delete axis.  Nearly ground to a halt after that sentence.  I suppose this hinges now on how long I have to continue for to make this a missive.  I don't know if there is a central agency which sets the length of missives, tracts and statements.  If not, there should be.  It would at least prevent confusion at times like this.

						   I thought today about forming a Lonely Club.  Not that I'm lonely, but it seemed a compassionate thing to do.  To get lonely people together in a non-threatening atmosphere.  I could send out leaflets which say things like "Spend a lot of time on the Playstation?" or "Lonely?".  I think there would be a good response.  And then I could franchise it out, to other Lonely Co-ordinators - an entire network of Lonely Clubs could spring up, eradicating loneliness forever.  But then I thought, what if no-one turned up?  Could there be anything more tragic than someone organising a Lonely Club meeting and ending up totally alone.  That could push some Lonely Club organisers over the edge.  I suppose they could work with a friend, you know, so they didn't get Lonely.

						   Is my interest in this whole thing waning?  It wouldn't surprise me.  I had a go with a couple of these before.  They turned out rubbish. On the other hand, this is day 2.  You're still here.  So am I.  Both of I.  So this has turned out great!  Maybe a 2nd anniversary party should be arranged.  I have little experience of blogs, apart from reading other people's and thinking "I could do that better and on a cheaper budget".  I have already fulfilled one of those obligations.  Can you see any spelling mistakes?  Grammatical errors?  No.  That is my pledge to you, the reader.  High quality English or your money back.  Should this be a slice of life?  Should this be about my day?  About my job?  About my interests?  Should this drop mentions to people who the average reader will have no idea about?   For instance, I have read blogs which say things like, "Mike and I went to the shops today".  Out of the blue.  Not only is it rude not to formally introduce "Mike", but it also strikes me as rather self-indulgent.  But maybe a blog is self-indulgent.  Maybe that's what it's all about.  Some kind of electro mind-wank, publicising the fact that there is a "Mike" and that you do fun stuff like going "to the shops" with him.  Even this sounds like protesting too much.  Why even include this Mike character?  What's wrong with "a friend"?  You can't dangle the carrot of a 3rd person dimension then whip it away from the reader, where Mike's place in the scheme of things always remains tantalisingly outside of your comprehension.  Surely, if you want some kind of confessional format to these things you need to foster that trust and connection between yourself and the reader.  The whole Mike thing takes a sledgehammer to that and batters it senseless.  What's next?  Is Mike going to have a spin-off Blog called "Mike"?  Perhaps Mike doesn't even exist.  Perhaps he's a construct which allows people to think that this blogger has a life.  That she/he is not so completely obsessed with blogging that she has to create an intricate fantasy life to have something to say.  That's some kind of weird Twilight Zone thought.  Matrix-esque.  Maybe all bloggers are just robots, well versed in human randomness.    Time for an oil change I reckon.

						   Fools!  Mwaahahhaha.  Sorry, I've always wanted to do that.  Well, seeing as it's just me and you here, how about we put on that old Harry Secombe record and strip to our underpants?  We could dance the night away.  That's if you're a woman.  If not, then please accept this firm handshake and be on your way.  Thanks for coming.   Who do I imagine is reading this?

Welcome, pull up a blind.  Fat bat trucker, honking smoke from his mid-west, hauling dixie in a freakvoy to venus.  Tucking a chompwich between his many chins and pausing amomentary while tracking young flesh over unspent highways.  Smiling mommy, orange juice and bright yellow lights, fixing drinks for Jimmy and his runaroundrunaround friends.  Play ball little children.  Behind her eyes is a void blue, fixatives and laxatives, strung up blackballed by a clan of no-ones.  Slap leather, bad smiles now and now, mascara running.

						   Well here I am again.  I have literally caught the bug.  I have come back in for another run, a bit like the Dambusters.  But with words instead of ingenious high explosives.  Hey, words can be ingenious high explosives.  Consider the Magna Carta.  Well I shall be dropping them indiscriminately on the unwitting townfolk of this page.  Oh I am so bored, I think I might stand up and spin madly around, laughing like a nutter.  My co-workers would probably stop me.  I am sitting here, and my sock has a hole in.  I always take my shoes off under the desk, as I am a very foot-centric kind of person.  I love my feet to be bare.  I can get with feet.  Just my own though.  I am not a fetishist for other people's.  That's one kink I can't understand.  Shoes maybe. Not feet.  That's just sick.  I used to have a small tin of fruit I would roll luxuriously underneath my arches.  But anyway, my sock has a hole in, and my second biggest toe is sticking out.  It feels different from the rest as a result, kind of priveledged, but naked, stripped.  Singled out.  Firing squad?  Or Lottery Winner?  It hasn't quite decided.  Good luck to it anyway, I say.  I just had a big muffin.  Am trying to watch my weight, but it was someone's birthday.  A bespectacled toff, obsessed with showering.  His birthday.  And he sent someone over to get us cakes and coffee.  I had filter coffee and a muffin.  I get muffins confused with crumpets sometimes, and get told off.  Bah.  And filter coffee.  Yes, that's right.  Not mocca-fuckin'-chocca-waccawaccawacca.  Just dregsy shitbox filter coffee.  Stick your cappucinos up your arse, caffeine fascists!  The Filterados will ride again!  I hate pretentious people.  Anyway, some chocolate got on my hand and I had to try to rub it off.  I did so but it went a strange green colour.  I believe I have been eating copper cleverly disguised as chocolate.  Someone just said "pizza" somewhere in the office.  I want some.

						   I'm a blog virgin.  My cyber cherry is ripe and unpicked.  It hangs, heavy with blog seed on the precarious branch of my interest. What's the deal with these things?  I've heard people can get a bit addicted to them.  Some Iraqi guy got a film deal out of one.  That's got to be worth the entrance fee.  Which is, after all, nothing. In other news, 'tis not long until we all decamp happily to Devon for a cottage-based holiday.  I should extrapolate somewhat for our US friends, whose knowledge of other countries is as shaky as their concern for human rights.   Damn.   This wasn't going to be a US bashing political style "blog" for a very good reason.  Americans can be repugnant, but generalising is for idiots.  Also, they don't have football hooligans do they?  Well, they do, but they tend to wear uniforms.   Damn, there I go again.   Well, suffice it to say, that however much disdain I might feign (in the membrane) regarding a-whoopin' and a-hollerin' Yankees, I have much more disdain for Americans of the ilk that wish they were anything but.  The sycophantic, self-conscious illiterati, those who actually think they can manage irony and sarcasm.  You're not good.  You people would crap on your own mums if you thought it would gain kudos from a French artist who made his name buggering wasps on the arc d'triomphe.  You're the sort of people who laugh knowingly during Polish art-house productions.  I think the Americans should invade their own country, root out this empire of evil, then throw a big party for all the normal Americans.  OK, so every country has these pseuds.  No doubt in some quarters I would be considered one here in the UK.  But I sometimes read the praise thoughtlessly meted out to UK figures by these bespectacled, achingly left-field nobheads on the basis that they aren't American, and want to vomit my own spine.  Why do I get so angry about this?  I'll tell you why.  Partly because I am slighly insecure, and the lingering doubt remains that they may have attained the holy grail of all things, being right.  But that's not really the crux of it.  The crux of it is that their "intelligent" comment is entirely constructed to appeal to their peers.  So that people will consider them "cool".  Like people who slag off The Simpsons, but come up with stern, considered reasons why which include terms like "social","kudos" and "unrepresentative".   OK, that explains that.  What has this got to do with your holiday?  Oh yeah.  Well I'm off there.  It's a big place Devon.  But in America it would probably be someone's garden or something.  Insignificant, but full of charm.  It's in the south-west, and after an anus-achingly difficult job booking it, we finally got there.  I get to fish for Salmon and Trout.  Please write in with articles on fish being able to feel pain, as this will enhance the entire experience of ramming a razor sharp hook through their faces.  Also, lovely walks etc.  I may get some photos and let my hardcore fans look at them (that's you by the way - heck, you've been here from day 1).  This is Day 1.  Shut up.

						   Welcome to this corner of the intraweb communicationary network.  I sit here typing this as random people continually look over my shoulder.  What is it with people?  Why can't they just fook off?  Then again, if I didn't want anyone to read it, why would I put it on the internet?  Well, because I do want people to read it, but not here in work where I am supposed to get paid not to do stuff like this but stuff like other stuff.  Right.  Well, even so, you shouldn't write anything too personal.  Doesn't that devalue the whole point?  Shouldn't this be an electro-forum for the splurging of my dark dark soul?  No.  I suggest you do not show too much of yourself on here.  There's too many weirdos about, and you're a bloke after all- baring your soul is un-natural.  That's true.  You're an ok guy you know that?  Thanks.  I try.  Have we met?  Oh, we may have.  Sometime along that dusty road we call life.  Hang on, you're me aren't you?   Yes. Well leave me alone.

						   Oh woe!! Woe is me! For the bitterest of all betrayals has occurred.  Those who I thought were the stout yeomans of common sense.  Those who I thought untouchable by the pervading trend in idiocy.  Those I thought I could trust.    Yes,  The Drivers  now merit their own entry after a particularly painful episode.       Previously, I had thought that these men, these long suffering footsoldiers had been immune to this ill wind.  But now they have joined the ranks of the damned. Picture the scene.  I am engaged in reading a particularly ludicrous passage of The Spear by James Herbert.  Enjoyable nonsense, a real page-turner.  I was looking forward to delving into the netherworld of the vividly described nazi version of the Wicker Man, drifting home in enjoyable isolation.  Cocooning myself no less into a steel case of oblivion to the collected Bus Mongs around me.  But no! No! No such favour would be granted.  Liltingly, deceptively, music started to play, it sounded ambient almost.  Background ambience - this could have even enhanced the experience.  But no, the half formed smile was snatched from my face and it's foetus crushed under the foot of aural pain.  The driver, under some crazed spell, had brought his tape.  His Phil Collins tape.  As the whiny slaphead wove his terminally mediocre melodies around my ears, I felt close to tears.  "Oooone more night-ah"  Far from being a paen to his leaving love, it seemed he was mocking me.  One more night of this bland shite assaulting my ears.  One more night of pain.  I resorted to placing my headphones on my head, musicless, just to buffer my senses from this assualt by this erstwhile geography-teacher's music collection.  To no avail.  To no avail.  I write this with tears in my ears.  Actually, thinking about it, the drivers are usually arseholes anyway - what did I expect?  Other drivers deserve passages to themselves, entire posts.  This, usually inoffensive, chap had offended by offering offensively inoffensive music to my offended ears.  But still, I shall be more wary of resting on my bus laurels.  If I lower my guard, they strike.

						           Imagine Alan Bennett in a burberry cap, sans Thora Hird, but with a penchant for recreational drugs and living in a high-rise in Birmingham.  That's The Streets.  And while buying this record left me feeling gritty and urban, I kidded myself that invention was the intention and it's retention comprehension.  Because that's probably a decent rap in Harrow or perhaps Milton Keynes. What I'm trying to say is that this album was way outside my normal purchasing demographic.  Normally, I walk smugly along the neat hedgerows and net curtains of the "safe" options that have already achieved legendary status, or the quirky pavement cafes of artists that you know won't attract passing trade (and therefore attention).  But I went to the bad side of town to buy this record.  Metaphorically.  In reality, I got it from an online retailer so didn't really go anywhere.  But for someone as un-versed in the ways of rap and urban music as I, this was a trip to the badlands.  I did not wish to assume the mantle of chav amongst my peers, but a performance by the Streets on the Jonathan Ross show could only be described as electrifying.  From my scant knowledge of such music, it seems to burst and flow with the unrefined energy that renders it so essential in the eyes of impressionable young'uns like our chum in the picture. Comparing The Streets with the chav phenomenon is lazy and unimaginative, but the similarities are there.  The diction, the themes, the little details, the pre-occupation with nightclubs, drugs and booze.  The slight whine and staccato rhythm of the vocals is another indicator, and the pulsing beat almost forces you to strut in that exaggerated chav way.  But to give them their due, the album is thought-provoking, relevant and exhilerating in the way that the chav is not.  Whilst your average street-chav can only hope to be a garish characature of someone with something worthwhile to say, The Streets write the manifesto for a movement which prides itself on being largely directionless.  To be a chav is less to strive for something, but to avoid being a host of other things from what I can tell.  It makes punk look well-informed and refined.  Take the energy, the hope, the reason for fighting or making a noise out of punk, and you have Blairpunk, or the chav phenomenon.  A social cult based on a bland and unstimulating society.  Where they all have just enough money to afford that new spoiler for the Fiesta or that new Sovereign ring, just enough to get smashed in a bus shelter with some girls with big earrings.  There's nothing heroic about the chav, and in many ways, there's nothing heroic about the downright grotty world in which The Streets live, rolling spliffs in front of the Bill, hanging around in nightclubs for people who don't turn up, taking drugs through boredom, the droning confrontational chat-up patter, hanging around in queues, trying to phone your mum.  It's not exactly Dr Zhivago.  But it's real.  And for an uncompromising truth, and an uncompromising document of our time, this is hard to beat.  And occasionally hard to bear.
