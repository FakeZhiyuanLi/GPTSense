      So yesterday my sister got a call from the recording studio were she is suppose to go to make her CD. Well the guy that is making her CD wants to meet with her but hear her first. And the girl that was handing out the prizes at the place my sister played at Friday night (the battle of the bands) works at the town hall and she was talking to the people there way back when my sister first played at the student lounge and she said how good she was and a lot of other stuff too. And they all planed for Stephanie to win at the battle of the bands and that is why they got the 4 hour recording session. So it was all planed for her to win but anyways the town said that if the recording goes any longer then 4 hours that they will pay for it. I think that is soooooooooo great I am really happy.

        Another boring day doing absolutely nothing. My cousin Sarah is here today and she is spending the night. She is kind of wild and hipper. Some times it gets pretty annoying. She is still fun to be with. Other then that it was another boring day. I hate it is the 2 week of vacation we have not done anything. The only good thing that I think we are going to do this summer is go to six flags. I cant wait. It is going to be so fun. My sister and I are going to go on all the roller coasters. Well I don't know if I will I think the thing I am most scared of are roller coasters but my sister said that if I don't she is going to drag me on them. I cant wait for next year so I can see (him) next year. I think he is mad at me though for not going out with him last year but whatever. Couldn't anyways. That's all I have to say.     p.s. lets take the retard out ( its a inside joke and obviously your not inside of it)!!!!!

      Isn't this exciting. OMG this is been the best first week of vacation ever. Tomorrow my sister is playing at this thing called the battle of the bands tomorrow night and I am so excited. I hope I will see someone I know (yeah right). The only bad thing about vacation is that the guy I've had the worst crush on all year is going to high school next year and IM never going to see him again. A good thing is that I also have a crush on this other guy too and he is in the same grade that IM in and I danced with him. I think hex total in to me. I just hope he asks me out next year. (he) like that wile ever happen. IM going through such a face Wright IM BOY CRAZY. Well my brain is about to explode from all this thinking. My little brain cant take all of this thinking. Well this is the end of my very sad story I bet when your done reading this you will be crying so bad. Goodbye.

      Last night was great my sister step played at this place called the battle of the bands in the back of Williston central. My cousin Amy and her boyfriend Jaime came. That was cool. My sister, Amy, Jaime ane I walked over to a baseball game to see if someone yes a boy was playing. But he wasn't. After that my sister was the first person to play and she sounded soooooooooooooooo good that everyone was talking about her. Then this other grouped played then two girls sang one of them sounded really good and the other one sounded really bad I mean really bad. Then a couple more groups played. My sister got really mad because they told her that she could only play a couple songs and everyone got to play for 25 minutes so she went out to the car then I fallowed her and I got her in a better mood of course. Then when we got back they were voting of who should win. O yeah and there was this really really hot guy that came and was taking notes. My sister and I were total in love with him. After everyone was done voting they started to tally them up. There was 5 prizes two free pizzas, two gigs out side of rockys and the really big one a 4 hour recording session. They started to hand out the prizes and the first two prizes went to the two girls who sang witch was the free pizzas and the next two prizes went to the two bands and that was two gigs at rockys. My sister got so mad and she was like there is only one more prize left. And they said the 4 hour recording session goes to Stephanie keesler my sister literally started shaking so bad and she was crying my MOM ran out having a fit like she won. All my family was crying so bad including me. After that we went out to eat at ponderosa it was yummy. By the time we got home it was almost 10:30. Well that's the end goodbye.
