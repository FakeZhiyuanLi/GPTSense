						   It's Monday which means another week of work.  Mondays always come eventually but just not when I want them to.  This weekend Ryan and I traveled to Madison, WI to visit with our good friends Josh and Leslie and get away from our homes.  Josh was in town for a Trek bike convention...Ryan was in heaven.  A great time was had by all.   So, today there is a lot going on in the village of Palatine.  Two events occured today in just a few hour span.  First, I went to my company storage unit to re-load my truck which was unloaded in order to help my co-worker move.  while I re-loaded I took the extra time to go through each tool box and re-stock and clean out what was in each of them.  Well, in the process a man in another row went to his storage unit.  This man creeps me out.  He opens every door in his van and hangs towels and clothing on the doors and has what looks like a closet in his van...I am convinced he lives out of the unit and in his van.  So, I went to the office to talk to the property management when I was through organizing and told her my concerns and asked what she thought...SUPRISE, I am not the only person to say something to her.  She said she has had a number of customers ask her the same question and express concern.  At first, when I decided to tell her about the situation I felt bad, if this guy lives out of there, I could be the cause to make him loose his home.  Well, I fell better that I wasn't the first to announce the concern...I'll let you know what happens.  The second event just occured in the neighborhood next to me.  Apparently a man ran a bus into a home and then drove off and was stopped and there is a stand off going on.  Earlier today I called my roomate to see if the news had anything on the incident because while I was leaving my storage unit I saw four helicopters flying overhead and police cars speeding down the interstate and a police action team armored vehicle cruising down the road.  I guess there is a man who drove a bus into a house, took off and they now are in a stand off!  This is seriously the most exciting thing that has happened lately in the village.  sad.

						   This weekend I ventured over to cedar rapids, IA where my fiance lives.  Ryan currently lives with his family but is moving into our first house in October.  This past weekend Ryan's family was out of town at their lake home so we had full run of the house.   Well, what could have been a fun weekend was cut short by Ryan's GI issues.  Ryan is ill, he has been ill for a week.  He went to the doctor for them to tell him a list of foods to eat and sent him home with a bill for $96 (well, his insurance company that is).  Now, Ryan hates the doctor and I had begged and pleaded with him to go.  Since the doctor sucked ass and did nothing for him, he doesn't want to go back because he sees it as a waste.  So, when I got to town I purchased pedialyte for him.  Sports drinks have too much sugar and in many cases can make the situation worse.  Just so you know, Pedialyte tastes like kool-aid you forgot to add sugar to...it is nasty stuff but it is supposed to be better than sugary juices and sports drinks.  We have since spent the weekend arguing over about drinking the stuff and if it really helps.   If you ever have a GI problem or know of someone who does, you also know that wherever you go, you need to have a bathroom near by which is why Ryan and I remained local this weekend.  We rented movies and cleaned the house, which I might add looks awesome.  We did laundry and dishes and straighted the place up...I hope his parents are pleased.  It's rough when you live in a space that is not your own.  You gotta make sure you do your fair share of the work.  Anyway, that was my eventful weekend....laundry, cleaning, and taking care of Ryan (who can take care of himself ).

						   I have a blog, my very own. No more just reading everyone elses, I can write my own too!!!! I guess when you start a blog that is when you begin to discover interesting things you can write about...I really don't have anything interesting to write about.  I guess a brief intro to my life is a start. I live in Palatine...Palatine, IL. It's a suburb of Chicago. I live with a roomate that I found on the Internet who turned out to be great but the complex is different...I really am not sure what it is, I love the interior of the place but step outside my door and I feel as if I have entered the ghetto, well not the ghetto but there are these gangs of different races...white, black, hispanic, asian...they all congregate in the evening and yell things at each other, it is strange. I haven't yet discovered the purpose and they don't harm eachother but the idea that they yell back and forth makes me think at some point they will all throw down. One time they burned down a dumpster hut, you would have thought the entire complex was buring down by the four fire trucks that showed up to pur the flames out...But I like my roomate and I guess that is what is important.  So, I live in Palatine because I work in the area. I am trying to get home to Iowa where my Fiance, Ryan, lives. Ryan and I have lived in different states for exactly one year as of Sunday, the 8th. We were engaged last december and are getting married in April 2005. Ryan and I have bought a house in Iowa, we have a storage unit filled with our belongings just waiting to be unloaded into our new home when we close at the end of September. I am waiting out my job to see if I will be able to transfer to Iowa...chances equal to about 1% so I continue to work and make money so that I can afford to live.  For the time being, I am stuck in Palatine.
