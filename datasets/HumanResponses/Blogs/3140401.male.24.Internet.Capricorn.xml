       My first entry in here, what should I write? Hmm.. Things are starting to get better. Just met a small family business owner in Bahrain who is well off enough to earn USD$60K/mth. That's exactly my personal financial goal! The beauty of cyber reality, oceans apart and we speak as if across the table. He agreed to supply my new internet business with some custom gold supplies but I have to create a website first. My apprehensive disclosure of my 'tender' age did not invite the anticipated silence and immediate dismissal, but more suggestions and advice from a veteran in his 40s who has started out when he was only 19. I have to make haste in setting up the website. Life is going to change for sure. * Wide grin *

       Went all the way to NTU to meet Mr Koh at the Techno Research Plaza. I don't know what he sees in me, he even went through the trouble to introduce me to all the big shots there. Had the feeling that I should at least say something when he introduced me, but I just don't know what to say. Am I supposed to say anything at all? The deputy director of the program, if I remember correctly, was an absolutely humble and amiable man for his age. Yet, I did not make the effort to create that much needed first impression. What on earth was I doing? All didn't go well even from the beginning:  Clueless Guy: "Sir, are you in the middle of something? Wonder if I could ask you about my business idea." Mr Koh: "Sure. Just call me XXXX XXX, it's ok." Clueless Guy: "Oh, ok.. Sir, let me get my laptop out." (Reaches for laptop and felt a hole where the battery should be) Clueless Guy: "Erm... Never mind, (putting the laptop back into the bag while Mr Koh moves to my side and looks confused when I did that) I did not bring my battery....." Mr Koh: "Oh.. you did not bring your battery..." Clueless Guy: "Let me just draw the business model out on the paper..."  Anyway, what's most comforting is that he seems to me as someone who really wants to see me get that scholarship, someone who is running the whole show to get that technopreneurship program recognised in Singapore.  Also learnt from him that when it comes to business meetings with people more senior than oneself, a session has to be agreed on for each other to show what one has to offer. If the other party insist that age is a decising factor for business success, then just back out from the deal since it's already a lose-lose situation.  Found out that his associate's friend managed to earn $14K/mth from eBay selling cellphone accessories. Sounds incredulous but why not if he manage a large volume of sales? It seems that $5k/mth is a really attainable goal for a sideline business eh.  ***  Mum's right eye has gone crazy, out of alignment. Wonder why... Have to get her to see an optimetrist soon.

       #1: Where am I going to find a mentor? Why would anyone want to help me? If I am successful and wealthy, how would I view people like myself now? Would I give him a helping hand? Even if I want to, how can I help him? What does he want exactly? I'm sure no one want to sound all preachy and end up making a fool of himself addressing something way off context. I someone is to approach me on an arranged meeting, how do I expect to be treated? How can I express my sincerity enough to let it show through? Should I even be asking this very question?   #2: What if I cannot find a team for my business idea? What if they leave in the midst of its creation? What can I do to attract and keep them? What do they want ultimately? Money? It's only the financially driven individuals that seek this path. But, this is not what the great leaders will seek, and they are the ones I seek. If given the opportunity to create wealth no one dared promised, why would I, as an assumed leader, take that offer up? I'd want to know more about the person first, the idea secondary.   #3: If I am unexpectedly left all alone with no support whatsoever, who can I turn to? Am I able to sustain myself? Without income, without proper shelter, without reliable friends, the only thing I can rely on will be the belief that I can change things, the hope. Knowing there are friends, the faith that they will be around, knowing shelter can be free, I have no fear to be left without income. Yet one should not allow others to bear one's plight. Be grateful that one still has support and strive to making that dream come true. But before that, ensure that one can live independently. Walk before run and later fly.  #4: Am I capable of making that kind of income from eBay, my only hope for self sustenance. If I can earn $500 from 100 items, I'll need at least 500 items to earn $2.5K. If $250 from 100 items, provided they are all sold, which is unrealistic, I will need 1000 items to hit that income level. 70% of items sold with gross margin of at least 100% per $5 costs item for an income level of $5K/mth will be around 1500 items listed. How much time is needed for the preparation? What are the financial implications for shipping and handling?? Should I break them up into weeks? 375/week. And where can I get the suppliers? What is the average time to acquire even 1 supplier and what products do you intend to sell exactly? Where can I get them locally? Are there cheap oversea supplies? Can they be sourced through my other business?  So much for questions tonight... time to relax.

       It is indeed true that the people with whom I associate with will determine my future. Living a pretty sheltered life for the past 24 years, hardly has it occurred to me as an urgent matter to earn my living. Antony Robbins is right again that it is usually the pains that motivate a person to achieve their potential best. Friends are working and earning at least $1.5K and what am I doing? Although a plan is under way for a $5k/mth income, I am not even getting a grand! I have to do something and there are only 6 more months to do so.   Spent the entire day organising the store room and took some pictures. I will keep to my promise to list 100 items in eBay by the end of next week. Hopefully it can draw in the first grand for a start. I'll be satisfied even if it is only half that amount.   Failed to memorise the 360 Japanese verbs. Obviously too taxing a task. Perhaps 60 verbs a day will do.   Need to draft out the business plan quick, but no access to data on the industries in context. Will touch the business concept later, and allocate time to finally design the website storefront. PHP and MySQL... STRESS~~  Returning to the gym tomorrow. Need to watch my calorie intake. Not eating enough. Need to stock up...  Actually, it's all well when I know that I do not have time. I won't have the reason to waste time then.  Somehow, I have a feeling that I need to break away from certain mindset before I can achieve great success in business. My lack of urgency is the likeliest indicator of that. First thing first, the business plan AND networking.

       It's always that unexplained apprehension when I'm being challenged to do something against my will that brought me to face hesitation and delay. They creep up on me and before I know it, I'd be wasting a few minutes here and there, culmulatively hours unwisely dwindled away during the course of the day. Too often have I overestimated my comfort zone, taking things in too quickly that strangely seem daunting only to my subconscious. Time to learn how to break things down into pleasing chunks.  Can't help but to think of that day. It's interesting how memories like those manage to find their way back into my unoccupied moments. It's not unprecedented. They will come to past soon enough, that yearning of possibilities that are irrationally grounded by assumptions that things could be the way I wanted it to be. Denial... Psychologist name it as the 2nd phase of rejection.   June... 6 more months... Why am I not feeling that anxiety? Maybe it is not real enough, or is it because I don't believe I can do it? Running a company and meeting businessmen much experienced and older than myself. Intimidating... Why can't a person just do it without piecing those fantasied worries together. Their gathered presence is sufficiently real to make me want to do something else to avoid conceiving them.   Got to get my namecard printed, and before that, my company registered. I guess it has to be a soleproprietorship first. Networking indeed is a long term process. New set goal: Start networking with suppliers and foreign importers in July.

       She got me to speak my heart but it was not a conversation between hearts. I was put to rest, without promises of being together, only those of seeking happiness elsewhere. I do not want to wander from believing what was told as the only truth, lest I brood over what could be wrong about myself. Yet somehow, I have the feeling that the truth is still not deeply etched in that mental rock of hers. At least she has given me a reason warm enough not to freeze that once wounded heart.  Gal: "Anyway Wencai ah let me be even more frank here k. It's not going to be possible between us so don't waste your time." Guy: * Heavy Silence * Gal: "Tell you why it is not possible k. There's only 1 reason which is all consuming and the only thing that matters to me. Cos you aren't Christian, though I do think you are a very nice guy." Guy: * Dead Silence and thought to himself " Think only positive thoughts, don't make the mistake twice " *  I learn much from that short exchange of long suppressed sentiments, that of expressing one's feelings early, of not letting the doubt manifest into unnecessary mysteries and even permenant loss. But is it wrong to just like a person without falling completely over? Blame it on my indecision to have it dragged so long, but would it be better if I had spilt the beans earlier? Could it all end in silenced admiration if it wasn't made known to her earlier on? Maybe yes, maybe no.   Anyway, there was the end of the hope that was so falsely kept and held closely to. But feelings cannot fade overnight. As much as I want to keep my promise to her, I'm human after all. Haiz... why lidat leh...

       Keep loosing sight of my goals. There are too many to keep a tight hold of them all at the same time. Taking time to relax and review the entire episode is good thing once in a while, can learn so much more when the past is observed in hindsight with a different perspective.   Returned a missed call and found out that Lawrence sleep walked last night and stepped on Hwee's belly. Was asked to consider participating in the management competition, but the $8K prize isn't at all appealing...  Finished the book on entrepreneuring for growing businesses and felt good for actually completing the entire book within an afternoon.   Thought about what's all these effort worth ultimately, these goals and time management stuffs. What's an ideal day like for me?  - Waking up feeling energetic and refresh - Meditating in the quiet morning, listening to the sounds of nature - Morning exercises to loosen up the body - Preparing meals for close ones - Sharing worthwhile time with friends doing thigns we all like - Engaging in activities that make a difference to the world - Quiet moments to reflect and learn something new everyday  Do all these have to wait till I attain those goals I have set for myself? Some of them, yes, but not all. In fact, most of the people are so caught up with what they are chasing that they do not realise that the present is when they can actually start feeling the way they really want to in the first place...

       Things are not as good as they seem now. Having read the book on successful entrepreneuring, there are so many things that I do not have and that acquiring them is something conceivably unattainable at my current status of achievement (if deciding on the self employment route can be considered anything of personal accomplishment).  Getting star team members and funds to start a business is indeed not for the faint hearted. Why would anyone, especially for someone my age and business experience (negligible), possibly want to spend their time and money on? Confidence and knowing exactly what one is talking about may be the deciding factor but I have to go the extra mile to convince even the  crust  of the VC community. Yet, there are proponents of anti-VC who are an entire breed apart from the conventional business minds.   Hwee said that the winners of the Business Plan Competition are usually those who have corporate backings. Now, how on earth could they expect greenhorn undergraduates to produce a plan of such seemingly unsurmountable calibre? I need to find out more. Really need that $60K, else I don't know where I could turn to. The VP of UOB? Perhaps. He sometimes visit our little monastary.  Stay positive.... Going to write Mr Koh tomorrow, hopefully he could provide me with some helpful pointers on how I should proceed with my business idea.  * * *   Attended the Global Conference on Buddhism today. Learnt something about not letting go of all things but having the awareness of unattachment to the material world; that one can still love, care and nurture without being attached.

        Starting to feel tired about myself and the people I have been with. Apparently, the image I have been portraying to people is not the most pleasant. I can see from their eyes and actions the apprehension; something no one will truthfully bother to bring to my awareness. In fact, I am starting to suspect that they are keeping me in a cage where I can never outlive my past. What have people around been talking about me? Indeed, should there have been any gossips in the days long gone to pass, the deed made a lasting impression. It is very disappointing, too discouraging.     &nbsp;   A truly good friend is one who allows my past to stay in the past and place me in a field of&nbsp;possibilities.&nbsp;Unfortunately, those I&nbsp;have been keeping company with have&nbsp;kept me in&nbsp;a cage for too long. I want to change but they keep me where I used to be. I need time to myself since those people aren't that encouraging anyway.     &nbsp;   Virginia was right. I am a person who will&nbsp;constantly seek changes. And I believe it will be a change for the better. Too long have I comment on my ambitions and great ideals. Too long have I not given results. No one I know give even a hint of encouragement, with only passing remarks of casual concerns. Some even mock me for showing only verbal images. How's that for friendship?? Not only aren't they helpful, they bring you down.     &nbsp;   Is it intentional? I don't think so. Subconsciously, maybe. Those who aren't great achievers will think lowly of themselves and believe others are no different from them, thus imposing a selfish standard to how much others are capable of. When people are not showing results, that reassures their presumptions. And when they hold that belief as true, every statement we make about what we are going to achieve will sound like a lie to them, and a gradual lost of faith to what we stand for.     &nbsp;   Is this the voice of my self-esteem? From Venerable Mahinda's public talk, I picked up a formula that struck a bell, an equation from those self-help doctrines: Self-Esteem = Achievements/Expectations. Perhaps that is true, but what I have observed is not as simple as it seems. It&nbsp;goes a long way back to who I have been and who I still am in their memories.     &nbsp;   This is what I should be telling myself everyday: Say not what you are going to do, say only what you are doing.&nbsp;Think of the next step while keeping to yourself the big picture. Share only with people you think can accept you no matter what the results are, as long as you are trying your best. Seek help only when you are already making the effort. And about the change... like I said, I need time to myself. &nbsp;

       Just read the previous 2 entries and noticed that I have felt the same frustration of inactivity and indecision for the past couple of days. So, I have decided to actually do something about it. Now, to plan for what's to be done tomorrow. Then, I won't have to go to bed 'list'lessly.

       Can't seem to settle down and feel in control. Keep finding myself staring at the monitor, undecided. Thoughts are struggling to cling on a definite object, but the many tasks just won't allow me to peacefully focus on one. To attend to projects will stray me from my schedules of my most important dreams; while to dwell in critical tasks will land me in stress ahead for assignments done in haste. What on earth should I do?   My left brain tells me to break these tasks into smaller and manageable bits, to at least DO something rather than brood over the consequences. So it seems, yet difficult to put in practice. 11pm and I am supposed to wake at 5.30am. Well done, there goes another chance at the track for IPPT preparation. Less than 2 months to hit 9.45s for 2.4km. Possible? Yes, if I get to it immediately and keep at it.  Need to do something about my speaking ability. Although I may sound confident, but I can see the confusion in their faces when I speak. Those thoughts just can't find a way out of my mind in a logical and smooth sequence. In fact, it was the worst presentation today...  Have a feeling that people can sense my discomfort when I speak with them, especially people whom I have no equal standings with. He is an entrepreneur who owns several profitable companies and I am a student who has not major business experience whatsoever. Need to feel at ease, but anyway, it was a start and confidence builds with repetitive attempts, isn't it? He is the 2nd most prominent individual whom I have approached for assistance and that left a lasting impression with me that people regardless of how successful they are are no different in their way of treating people as any nice people would.  It's very much different from how it is like what I read about that fact, of what people who themselves have taken those steps said about their feelings. It only comes across to me that it is indeed true when I have experienced it myself. So there it is~ How we treat others and thus how people sees us is no different from how successful people will see us. We will still be who we are and that is what determines our relationship with anyone.   Meditate for a while before I call it a day.

       Why is it that when we want to share something from what we have learnt about life in general, some people just get turned off? Sometimes, they may even use it to judge our character in a negative way, comparing what was said to the speaker's past behaviour.   We all have ideals that we want to live up to, and when we share this ideal in the form of suggestions or sometimes solicited advice, they are taken as something we ought to live up to in every single moment of our mortality. When the listener recalls a contradicting image of the speaker, doubt and even mockery surfaces. Is that reasonable? Is it wrong to share that ideal? Even adults who subconsciously claim themselves to be matured are culprits of this subtle and destructive habit.  Nonetheless, it is foolish to impose this understanding to people who are staunch believer that people who don't walk their talk are no better than dreamers. I think they are a bunch of very confused people. So why bother arguing with people who are only keen to prove you wrong?  Anyway, it is only common for people to think that way. We don't lose anything if we keep our mouth shut. Moreover, people learn best from the examples we set, not by what we say. Everyone has the ability to realise the truth of their thoughts and it just takes times and circumstances for certain messages to get through to them.   When we are full of opinions of what's right and wrong to do, and tells that to another person, they will think that we are treating them as idiots who cannot understand what we are trying to tell them. And most of the time, the things we say are philosohical cliches.  So the point is.... to accept the fact that people will continue to judge us by what we do, not what we say.  * * *  Had a slight headache after class. It's only the first day and I am feeling the stress already. How on earth am I going to manage so many tasks? Decided to just relax and meditate on the way home, with an unprecedented experience:  It was as though I have FELT the separate existence of the mind and the physical breathes. How the movement of the breathe remains constant while the mind flickers around with the array of thoughts that come and go, and how it clings to mental objects that are often related to the memories we have imprinted in our mind. Interesting....

       I read it off somewhere that it is how the successful people make use of their time that distinguishes them from the pack. How much time am I putting in to go about the most critical tasks of my day? Obviously, I'm spending more time with my eBay store than I should be with my iPortal business plan. Money pressure. Still, there's the need for me to commit at least some time for my laguages... Perhaps 2 hours a day is too much. People are having 3 hours per week and I spend 7 hours more. Is it really necessary? Anyway, the gym sessions are draining much of my energy. Those myoplex supplement must be really overdued, kept making chocolate sundae in the toilet... That aromor and texture, OMB~ (X_X).  Done some research into mum's symptoms and found out that it could be a squint she has gotten. May cause blindness if it is serious and she may have to go for an operation, which is what she dreaded the most. And that son of a bitch is not doing anything to help except making her more miserable. Why can't he grow up for once... 28 already and he cannot even  settle down with a job and the only thing that occupies his pea brain is women. I can only wonder how he is going to sustain himself when mum is not around. On 2nd thought, who cares.  It could be a few more years (or lesser) before I have to consider earning my own living, relying on myself. Mum is already asking me to get a driving license so I can help her out with her store, something she may not be able to tend to after this medical incident.  I need to focus on getting my company up and running pretty soon. Hopefully eBay can bring in some good income while I am at it. Got to manage my time much better. 3 more months to bring in $5k/mth... possible? Not so if I allow myself to stray from that goal. Go! Just move forward and don't look back, please. And focus on the positive outcomes!!! p(o_o)q

        Good news: Successfully enters 2nd Round of the Business Plan Competition.      Bad news: Expectations imposed by the judges are intimidating. Was shown a failed scoring sheet with the overall results.    Don't have much to comment on what's to come, but hopefully it all turns out well.      Haven't been doing much about the plan itself. Kept finding myself dwindling hours away with D2X and animes. Always taking such a long break after a small victory       Revisited my personal time table and decided to remove some of the major goals. There are just too many things on my mind at the moment. Guess the most pressing ones will eventually find they way to completely occupy my life. I can only wonder how I will ever have time for my friends, not to even say loved one, should I ever have one. It's kind of funny to even think of it this way...      They say it is the journey that matters and that it is important to enjoy the process then to look forward to the goals. Am I missing something here? Perhaps it isn't my passion afterall, this all business thing. Yet, it is also said that persistance will drive any ambition home, as long as you want it bad enough. Still, I am not having that BURNING DESIRE to keep at it 24/7!! What the HELL is wrong here?!?! If only I can just focus my entire effort on 1 single goal for a sustained period of time until I attain some achievements!!! Faith. Belief. There are work to be done with them.       I often end up sleeping much later than the stipulated time. Feel like a habit forming already.       Hmmm... I need a dose of laughter and a pint of calmness and a truckload of confidence.
