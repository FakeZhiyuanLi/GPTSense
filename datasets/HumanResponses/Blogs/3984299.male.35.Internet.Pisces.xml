						   I have been in Jackson MS for the past few days attending my little sister's high school graduation, seeing distant relatives and catching up with old friends.  The night before I left Baton Rouge, Brett gave me several CDs chock full of  urlLink Damien Youth's  music.  I'll begin by saying that I'm not a big Folk music or 60s Psychedelic music fan.  While DY certainly cannot be classified as either, those seem to be two of the biggest influences in the songs I have.  I really like this stuff though.    I'm a weird music listener.  I've always said that I don't like bands, I like songs.  There are about 8-12 songs on these 5 CDs that I see myself listening to for the forseeable future.  That ain't bad considering the fact that I only heard of this guy 4 days ago.  Bride of the Asylum (1998)  This record alternates between creepy goth-folk and gleefully derisive anti-religion ballads, with a few love-lost songs tossed in.  Suprisingly (to me),I really dig the goth-folk.  The record opens up with a standout track, "Bride of the Asylum".  It's one of the songs that I will keep in my musical canon.  Haunting background vocals and lyrics like  And the moon illuminates All the scars upon my face Antique mirror duplicates me in shadows  make this an atmospheric fit for the soundtrack of some indie film (somebody look into this).  It's a mood-setter.    The next track, "Katie Called Me Lucifer", is a lot less spooky.  It is a melodic song that the  urlLink reviewers  really seemed to like.  I like it as well.  DY toys with religious imagery on the tracks "Hermaphrodite Jesus" and "Mythical Light".  Of the two, I think that "Mythical Light" is superior lyrically.  The former comes off as the indie-folk equivalent to something a shock-jock would pull on air.  Or something...  "Virus" is perhaps my favorite track.  It's got reverse-effects (always creepy), a wicked echo-effect on the vocals (also creepy), vocals that are....creepy, and a nice melody.  This song (along with the title track) will stick with you.  I am shocked that DY is able to evoke this level of atmosphere (he's a one man project) with only a 4 track and an acoustic guitar.  Great stuff.    The album (according to the official website) was released on Blackberry Records.  One reviewer mentioned the quality of the packaging and expressed a desire to see more releases from the label.  I wish Brett would fill us all in on the rise and fall of the label.    Strangers (1996)  This is probably my least favorite album of the five I have.  It is more straight-forward folky.  DY goes minimalist on most of these tracks, and there is a conspicuous lack of vocal effects.  There are no "bad" songs, but some of them do fall into the "uninteresting" pile.  "Come To My Stone", the third track, is a nice ballad and is the standout among the first five songs, which tend to run together.  Track 6, "We Dream In Corpuscile Blue" is my favorite on the CD. It is (presumably) an autobiographical song in which DY rails against a fundamentalist upbringing by presenting random memories from "sabbath school" and "vaction bible school".  Containing lots of odd images and dripping with sarcasm, the song reaches a climax with DY asking "Oh God what have you done to me?"  See kids?  Emotional music doesn't have to be whiny.    "No More Shoulders" is the most radio-friendly song on the disc and is definitely a keeper.  It is catchy and honest--no fluff here--while being quite accessible. I can easily imagine this song being blasted from sorority girls' cars and being played at high school dances.  Of course, this might be because I have a weird imagination.  All of the songs are quite melodic and most of them have a rather plainitve tone.  I recommend it even if I myself will probably only listen to "We Dream in Corpuscile Blue" with any regularity.    more to come....

						   He's written an autobiography. I read a lot of his fringe, occult stuff when i was a lad, checking the books out from the library in Amite. It would be cool to revisit this craziness.  never read The Outsider though. Just thought it should be noted. It was the daft stuff on the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, UFOs, and in particular the actual book The Occult.

						   The Mecca of book stores. It seems that everyone going to the festival this year will  receive an upcoming book of short stories for children (?) by Margaret Atwood, so Sarah Marshik shall be giddy. I have not recognized that many names in the program, but John Updike and Zadie Smith are among the ones i do know. There are quite a few not-quite-authors as well,  like Terry Jones of Monty Python and Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band. I'm too much of a plebian to deciper the importance of the rest without help.

						   Like Phillip's,  my  sister graduted from high school today.  Instead of this dredging up all kinds of emotional baggage, it afforded me the opportunity to have a good, innocent, fun time.  I jumped on a moon walk (or space jump), I went on a scavenger hunt, and I laughed like a little girl all day long.  I'm glad my sister is not tied up in a lot of petty high school drama-mongering and is able to cut loose.    I shall have much to say tomorrow-- the Damien Youth review is indeed forthcoming (as promised) and I'll take a stab at reviewing Luther Blissett's "Q".  Until then....

						   Louise has urged me to check out the site before, but i never actually registered to it until i saw that one may receive free advance reader's copies of some books. Quite mercernary of me, eh?   There seems to 353 members in Baton Rouge today. Six books have been released into the wild in the past couple of weeks. I forgot the reason why it's hard for me to stay excited about this site is because so many people have tastes in books that are uninteresting to me. I hate being an elitist pig, but so many of the books being introduced into public places, in hopes of recruiting a new reader, seems to be pulp. I'm not keen on many of the locations that these people pick either... Walmart, sporting goods shops, and computer gaming shops. Few of the books released seem to be picked up by anyone who might care to report them back to Bookcrossing. That's even more discouraging than whatever snobbery i have towards other people's tastes.   I'm still mulling over whether to drop off a few extra copies of books in some more strategically located places at the most opportune times, or to horde them all and be a library unto myself.

						   I'm still trying to figure out what i'm doing with a copy of 'The Secret Teachings of All Ages' on my desk. It seemed like a great thing to order a few weeks ago, but i have no memory of discovering it. It simply popped into my head that i must  acquire this book, with no traceable prompting. The author is as peculiar as a blank slate to his encyclopedic work as Potocki is a protean colossus to his convoluted stories.

						   Bah. Unconvincing. The only interest he had was in maintaining the continuity of the Catholic Church. That is not the act of a moral man, but a politician absorbed in temporal power. If he had any integrity, he would have evacuated the Vatican and continued his papacy in exile. This 'evidence' that he saved any number of Jews proves nothing, as his other actions define that he was playing both ends against the middle. He did not make a stand either way. He made some tepid remarks denouncing massacres, not even specifically against the Jews or accusing the Nazis, as the Catholic Poles were being slaughtered as well. We heard some of the same excuses from the Nazis themselves, blaming each other for the greater atrocities, insisting that the crimes could have been so much worse if only that particularly person had not been there to slow it down with his passivity. A religion shoudl be about making a definitive stand about right and wrong, not calculated moves to remain in an influential position. Compromise is not so easy for those who presume infallibility.

						   please define. That seems deeply regressive to me. It's like denying evolution. Modern Christianity is just a sanitized version of the worship of Mithras. In the days after Jesus, they took the words of love and compassion of a mystic Jewish rabbi, and grafted it into another popular religion to make it more palatable, more familiar myth to embrace. There was definite synthesis going on there. Traditions were sundered and reforged. According Guenon, what would be the most intellectually honest option?

						   My baby sister has just recently graduated from the slightly prestigous Mississippi School for Math and Science, a boarding school for gifted high school students. This has affected me much more than I would have thought if you had asked me a month ago. It doesn't happen that often, but sometimes I just get surprised at how strange I can be. My first reaction to the news was along the lines of "eh, whatever, move, I can't see Ferrigno". Afterwards, however, it really began to sink in. I understand that I am very fortunate to have a sister as beautiful and wonderful as Dana, and I also value the relationship we have. So, the pride I felt came as no surprise.  The emotional baggage snuck up like a ninja, though. The issues brought up are varied and sundry, but also neatly categorized and numbered as follows:  1. "I'm getting older and I'm going to die"- I realize that this shouldn't be an issue at 22, but i've struggled with this since I was twelve, so why not? I envy Bill his faith sometimes. I think it would make the intense fear of oblivion somewhat easier to deal with. Call me strange, but I really worry that there is nothing after death. I would much rather burn in the southern baptist lake of fire than cease to be. That is enough of that.  2. "What if Dana sucks a pee-pee?"- This one is probably self explanatory. I do, however, have a few things to add. Dana has always been very intelligent and confident where it matters, but every virgin I knew going into college was promptly deflowered. I'll admit that was fun, still the idea of someone using her like that really gets under my skin. I'm going to be a nervous father someday.  3. "I should be getting a bachelor's about now...oops."- Wait, I dropped out of college. I guess this is a moot point, but it rankles. I'm pursuing a career I absolutely love, but it would have been nice to be the first in the family to have a collegiate degree. Oh well, she's going to get a doctorate, so we're ok.

						   I don't think the colloquialism "fish out of water" has ever been more apt in the history of the world. So I'm going to stick with what I know. What I know is that  urlLink glassjaw  is brilliant.  I don't think that anyone who has actually heard them can have the confidence to call them a crap band. You may not like them, but respect is due.

						   We finally begin to get to the meat of the matter.    I have seen that Guenon has been connected to everything from National Socialism ("say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, but at least it's an ethos" - Walter from the Big Lebowski) to the Hollow Earth society, but I have decided to reserve judgement until I have read his stuff for myself.    One of Mr. Guenon's most famous 1deas is that if one were to sincerely follow a religion, the only intellectually honest option is to follow the most traditional form of that religion.  This basic idea has been seconded by many, including native Chinese Buddhist philosophers in reaction to Alan Watts.  But I digress.  Regarding the "Catholic Church suborned Nazism" party line, I have already argued the issues  urlLink here .  Begin with post #20 and proceed ad infinitum...  We shall  definitely  talk religion, my friend, but I fear I must defer to my associate, who has a few things to add.  Also, Guenon ain't all fire and brimstone... I also want to read:   urlLink The Esotericism of Dante    urlLink Insights Into Christian Esotericism   Addendum:  I had three hours (the time it takes to drive from Baton Rouge to Jackson, Ms) to give Damien Youth a close listen.  The Verdict:  I think he is borderline genius.  But again, I defer to my associate......

						   Yow! In mucking about trying to figure out who this Guenon character is, i realized that he's mentioned in that  urlLink Fortean Times piece on Potocki . With mention of an underground city of Argatha, visions of Hollow Earth sprang to mind, and i started seeing goddamned Nazis everywhere again. I even ran across  urlLink a thread on Barbelith  that made me more suspicious of Guenon, even though his name does not seem to be mentioned. Nope, not a bit of that is relevant, but Hollow Earth stuff is just nutty.   Fortunately, there's  urlLink a slightly less insane reference to Argatha  with an actual connection to Guenon that's 100% Nazi-free. It's even dragging in Jacques Vallee, UFOs, and the 'Tao of Physics'.

						   Just thought it should be noted. No, i haven't deciphered all of Bill's allegiances, but we already know we're on different sides off many arguments. I'm a hardcore liberal who sincerely believes that Glassjaw is an absolutely crap band.   The Christian establishment has committed too many greivous errors and pointless atrocities to be trusted as a spiritual champion. Members of the establishment may be sincere in their desire to make a better world, but liek that Jesus guy say, chop that rotten tree down. The Catholic Church tolerated, possibly even actively supported the Nazis during WW2. We could go back through time and find all of its other mistakes, but that's big and recent enough mistake for me to want to ignore anything it has to offer now.   The Nazi persecution of the Freemasons only cements my sympathies to the Freemasons, no matter how suspicious i am of them.

						   I am only reading the reviews of the books on Amazon, and some quickly googleed up pages to find out who these cats Bill is referencing are. In purest ignorance, i have doubts about the arguments of this Guenon character. Although i dearly love science, i could see this 'industrialized science' being a threat, as there is no insight or wisdom, only immediate practical application with no foresight. As for his fear of democracy being an appeal to the law of the brute force of matter, bullshit. This sounds like the words of a devotee of divine right. He seems well-versed in the major branches of religion, but his reviewers seem to propose that he's still caught into a trap of matter versus spirit, something i cannot accept. Ignoring or denying spirit is a failure, but i will not accept that spirit is inherently superior, as it's like arguing that a three dimensional representation is better than a two dimensional one. Are you really willing to say statues are inherently better and more true than a painting or photograph?

						   In case all of you "normal people" haven't noticed, Brett and I have recently become obsessed with the history of occultism/esoterica/secret societies.  For me, this is in part a delayed reaction to questions raised during my visits with a monk last summer.  I have lots of friends in Hattiesburg, MS-- the town made popular by Afro Man's brief time in the spotlight.  Who, you ask?  Exactly.  At any rate, my friend the Gentleman John (the last Bohemian, but that is another story) and I stumbled across this Eastern Orthodox Monastery in the wilds of Ellisville Mississippi.  Stunned beyond rational thought (and having studied and greatly admired Eastern Orthodoxy for quite some time), I decided to visit.    The hermitage was inhabited by one elderly gentleman, Father Elia.  I was very impressed with his eloquence and depth of knowledge.  I stayed for seven hours the first day, talking with him about our pasts, about his faith, and about jurisdictional squabbles among the Orthodox that have left Fr. Elia rather isolated organizationally.  As I said, he was quite smart and knew a LOT about the history of Christianity.  He had spent years in the Holy Land and had "learned and forgotten six languages."  He is still fluent in French and Arabic.  One thing that struck me as odd, however, was the fact that our conversation continually turned back to Freemasonry.  He is convinced that the Freemasons have "infiltrated" the highest levels of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.    My first reaction was to disregard all this as paranoid conspiracy theory, but some of his comments stuck with me.  I did a little (very little) research and discovered, for example, that Fr. Annibal Bugnini, the man responsible for the changes to the Mass in the Catholic Church wrought by Vatican II was denounced as a Mason and was apparently dismissed from his position of power because of it.  A balanced look at the facts can be found  urlLink here .    I recall telling John that I wished there was a non-paranoid, conspiracy-connected history of Freemasonry.  My reading of  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  has only reinforced this wish.  Could a man otherwise quite temperate and level truly be a paranoid conspiracy theorist?    And for that matter, is the very idea of monasticism "in this day and age" an antiquated and silly concept?

						   I have yet to make any significant progress with  urlLink The Manuscript Found in Saragossa , despite Bill's exhortations, as i keep trying to tie him into the tapestry of his times, as his life must be more peculiar and extraordinary than this celebrated book.    urlLink One short biography . I'd like to see more documented details of his time in Paris, particulalrly his connections to people who were part of the Bavarian Illuminati, like Abbé Barruel and Adam Weishaupt. I was into the Bavarian Illuminati when i was obsessed with Robert Anton Wilson's  urlLink Illuminatus . Was his book about Herodotus and early Russia real, a prank, or insanity? And what the hell was he doing in Mongolia?   I'm also surprised to see an article about the man and his damnedly odd book in a urlLink  back issue of one of my favorite magazines . See? The McSweeney's crowd ain't all bad, comrade...

						   "Sometimes I am a collector of data, and only a collector, and am likely to be gross and miserly, piling up notes, pleased with merely numerically adding to my stores. Other times I have joys, when unexpectedly coming upon an outrageous story that may not be altogether a lie, or upon a macabre little thing that may make some reviewer of my more or less good works mad. But always there is present a feeling of unexplained relations of events that I note, and it is this far-away, haunting, or often taunting, awareness, or suspicion, that keeps me piling on."

						   yeah, yeah.... i know that the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail is a castle of suppositions built on the shifting sands of Pierre Plantard's forgeries. Still, Foucault's Pendulum might not exist in the form that it does without Holy Blood, Holy Grail being published. There are still a lot of pieces in it that i want incorporated into a new narrative.   One is Poussin's "Les Bergers d'Arcadie". Sauniere of Rennes-le-Chateau bought a replica of this painting among a few others. It's the inscription of  Et in Arcadia Ego   that's the important part. Nevermind the assertion that the painting has Rennes-le-Chateau in the mountainous background or that the tomb actually existed. The geography is all wrong for the Rennes-Le-Chateau to be in that painting, and the tomb that the HB, HG authors said that it might really be was a 20th century construction, something made in homage to Poussin long after even Sauniere was dead. I truly do like the idea of the anagram though. Truth is almost irrelevant. Bill, is the anagram of  Et in Arcadia Ego  , the much cooler  I Tego Arcana Dei  actually proper Latin for, "Begone! I conceal the secrets of God" or is it so much more fanciful, pleasing bullshit?

						   I refuse to read  urlLink The Rule of Four  any more than i have. It's amateur dross riding off the coattails of the Da Vinci Code to exploit a market dredging the obscure and arcane for another pop culture, paint-by-numbers thriller. It's not the dredging that I object to, but how lazily it's executed.   The book that the Rule of Four authors hang their story around is  urlLink Hypnerotomachia Poliphili . I haven't been able to wrap my mind around it yet as it's obtuse as hell. I don't even know if it deserves to be rescued from the clutches of the half-assed efforts of those Ivy League boys.   It's hard to embrace a book that keeps being hyped as having a nearly sexual obsession with architecture. It makes me think of that Dan Clowes 'Eightball' comic in which he rips on the creepiness of the old Harvey comics like Richie Rich and Caspar the Friendly Ghost, with one character that is sexually obsessed with octagons, and begins masturbating every time he sees a 'Stop' sign.

						   I have this extrememly urgent desire to instantly know what other people think about me.  Normal enough, until it becomes an obsession that demands action.  I find myself saying things in a certain way to influence the opinions of others.  It's another defense mechanism that I've developed since my ex and I broke up.   I found an old journal of mine kept when I was sixteen.  Instead of the typical agnsty clap-trap, I was shocked to find a fairly sophisticated (and pretentiously composed) examination of the "two of me" problem lots of teenagers face.  See, while I managed to keep abreast of the raging acedemic debate on the military revolution at age 16, I was also trying not to get busted for selling hydrocodeine to peers at the local shopping mall.  I tried really hard to be ignorant and "cool" when around others, but engaged in an in-depth e-mail debate on the true effectiveness of Gustavus Adolphus' military reforms when in the privacy of my own home.  I can vaguely remember thinking that all that made me "well-rounded".  I was fairly popular (class favorite in the 10th grade), fairly well-respected (associated with the "tough-guy drug crowd"), and fairly fucking nerdy as well.    The journal, an oversized green hardcover with wide-ruled sheets, contains thoughts I had forgotten.  "Which me will I choose?" I cry plaintively over and over again.  It's funny now.  I'd like to think there was a conscious choice, a turning point where I  decided  to fix up and look sharp.  I was an asshole a few years ago, and I knew it.  So I quit with the drugs, quit with the posturing, and just became.... and herein lies the problem.  I'm a pushover now.  I let an emotionally wrecked little girl nearly ruin me.  Now I'm on the cusp of going out into the world and living an adult life.  Spooky.  Reading-  urlLink Death and the Dervish   Listening- Damien Youth (thanks Brett).

						      So my boy Billy sends me this invitation to post along with him here, and i instantly jumped at the opportunity. I've never had such an outlet for my ego, and i must admit it is intriguing.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of this is.  I'm anything but internet savvy.  Therefore i will use this outlet to give opinions on all things media:books, music, movies, etc.  I don't really know the famed Brett, but i do know a couple things about him. 1.He handles weird accidental crank calls very well, smooth even.+ 2.He likes Belle and Sebastian.- 3.He was knowledgable and nice enough to inform me that they got their name from that old cartoon about that orphan and his big white dog.+ So far he's got a positive record.     Now, a few things about myself. I'm neither as well read or scholarly as Bill, and I will probably never back anything with any sort of fact whatsoever. Fortunately, i'm going to do my best to make no comments on any sort of issues of import. My life revolves around spider-man, baked goods and animal face-off. My posts will reflect as much.    All i can think of to comment on today is Hulk, which i finally broke down and saw.  The only thing i came away from this picture with is that green Lou Ferrigno was much scarier and more interesting. Considering the money that goes into these movies i am very sad now.

						   Finally i wean myself from that damned computer game...   In the attempt to extract some bit of truth from the small portion of details that i've dredged up from the internet and a handful of books on secret societies, alchemy, magick, lost science, and the Great Hidden History of Humankind, i throwing up my hands in despair yet again. I've had more own blog for ages, but over the months, it's narrowed its purpose to music alone... rock-pop at that. In messing about with the origin of the Rosicrucians, one author proposed that the invention of the original Rosicrucians is akin to a proto-Situationist movement. Since the only exposure i've had to that word recently has been through obtuse comic boos, i had to look that up. Now i find that the Situationists were the sucessors to Dada and Surrealism. One Situationist, Guy Debord, published a book covered with sandpaper, so that it would damage whatever it was placed against. This immediately brought to mind some music that i only recently discovered, the first album by the Durutti Column, which did the exact same thing with an album sleeve. Oh.... back to music.   It frustrates me that i abandoned so much of the world to muck about with the recorded musical efforts of a bunch of people i've never heard of when there is supposed to be so much more that i must learn about this world. To obsess over such minutae seems foolish. However, either i naturally gravitate back to music, or there is some other holistic reason, that every idea and concept is reflected in another aspect of the human experience. Human history is too vast and too detailed ever to be comprehended by a single human mind. Is that why we constantly steal and reinvent ideas? The punks paying homage to the Situationists with their abrasive media coverings is the same damned thing to the Rosicrucians finding ways to cram their invented alchemies with references to the Kabbalah and Egyptian magick. I do believe in innovation and creation, but i do wonder exactly how much we have lost and perverted through the years.   Aw, fuck it. I don't quite know what to do with myself, not even how to struggle with how much i don't know and how to accept that.

						   I have blessed an eager young mind with Michael Moorcock,  gratis .  I'm certainly not claiming that Moorcock is the greatest fantasy author, but I can recall that stumbling on to the Elric books led me on to much more "valuable" stuff.  The truth is that I'll always remember Moorcock fondly.  I devoured most of his stuff, leaving out only the Dancers at the End of Time series (which I'm told is an oversight on my part) and Gloriana (which is impossible to find).  I have decided to start using this space to review books.  I've read quite a few good books in the past few months and would like to share my impressions of them.  Be on the look out!  As I become more savvy (this is my first stab at a blog), expect a variety of links and a more unique look-- the template is great, but I need my independence!!!!!!!   Why does the spellcheck feature consider the word "blog" an error?  Masochism?

I am happy with my job because I love books and like to stay on top of what's going on in the "industry", even if this very information tends to be depressing.  My friend  urlLink Brett  and myself have noticed that rabidly anti-intellectual fundamentalist evangelicals are initiating a new Dark Age.  We constantly void good, solid literature to make room for "Christian Fiction" titles that boast gaudy "feel-good" covers and Hallmark movie-of-the-week plots.    The "Left Behind" series is getting lots of media play at the national level... its solid sales apparently represent an "Evangelical Bloc" in this country that the media sees as a force to be mobilized.  Fine.  It "ain't" good literature.  Brilliant evangelization technique, horrible as art.  I realize that a chain bookstore does not have the luxury to stock all the good stuff.  We have to have what sells.  I'm not mad at the company, then, for strategically stocking what is most likely to sell.  This is basic retail philosophy.  I'm mad at the culture that dictates its terms to us: "Pop kitsch has invaded publishing, is here to stay, and must be accomodated."    So this kid comes into the store one evening.  He is bright, articulate, and starving for a good read.  Like most boys in their early teens, he's into fantasy.  When I was 12 years old, I had J.R.R. Tolkien, T.H. White, and any number of pulp-fantasy books to explore.  It was "fun-to-read" stuff.  I can remember being ridiculed in the fifth grade for reading "The Master of Whitestorm" by Janny Wurts not because it was fantasy, but because it was "big".  Again with the culture....  The young man had been reading D&D series books and was getting tired of them.  Brett and I suggested that he read some Michael Moorcock.  I can remember stumbling onto Moorcock at about 13 or 14.  I bought an Elric book in the Ace paperback edition because the covers were cool.  Serendipity.  Our store does not stock much Moorcock, and the kid REALLY wants more, so I have decided to lend/give him my omnibus edition of the Elric books.  I am glad to do it, and will make the handoff at work this evening.

						   And so we begin....  I am starting this primarily for myself, although I suppose blogs are intended to be shared.  In the near future I intend to collaborate with a wily veteran of the blogging game, the esteemed Badger, music connoisseur and scion of well-intentioned conspiracy theory. Our partnership will likely make this blog more interesting than it would be otherwise, and for that I am glad.  Guest postings by my good friends may pop up here and there, and their contribution will allow us to cover all parts of the "Bitterness Spectrum" without seeming neurotic.  Assuming that this will indeed be the permanent location of this ambitious project, allow me to consecrate the space with a brief rant:  I have been watching quite a few DVDs recently.  I go all out, viewing every last special feature available on the disc.  Quality varies, as is natural, but I have noticed one thread that ties nearly all of them together: Has anyone actually listened to an interview with a director or an actor?  I mean  really  listened.  If not, consider yourself lucky.  NO ONE MAKES ANY SENSE!!!!  They talk for minutes on end without actually saying anything.  The two that stick out in my mind (read: haunt my dreams) are Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai and E. Elias Merhige in Shadow of the Vampire.  Cruise babbles incessantly , almost drunkedly, about the film, saying things like "Without the actors' dedication and hard work, the film would not have been successful."  Really Tom?  Without the cameras, the film would have never been shot.  If you had not been born, you would not have been the star of this movie.  I cannot adequately convey the nonsensical mush-speak this guy was spouting (all ironic references to the present communique are duly noted and considered quite apt).    "Quite apt?"  He's even got me doing it.  E. Elias Merhige is even better.  Now, I understand that directors are by nature flighty and prone to delusional contextualizing... "My film is the logical result of the realist critique of Fellini's pacing etc etc"... but Merhige is a master of no-speak.  It takes the guy a long time to complete a thought, and he often loses himself.  He also mispronounces "subsequently" as subSEEuantlee with emphasis on the second syllable.  Ordinarily I'm not too bothered by mispronunciation... we all do it and it can be embarrassing, but this guy is really pouring the pretension on very thick throughout the interview and this mispronounced word REALLY grates.    I will stop now.  A random start (I did not plan to ridicule E. Elias fucking Merhige in my first post) but a beginning nontheless.  Help me Brett!!!!

						    urlLink In Search of the Miraculous  is still in my stack of books that i'm reading, but i'm not finding it nearly as compelling as Gurdjieff's actual words in  urlLink Meetings with Remarkable Men . In Ouspensky's book, Gurdjieff comes off too much as a clever con artist. While he may very well have been just a clever con artist, I want to read his words without trying to dissect them with utmost skepticism the first time around. None of it sinks in that way, as my mind's racing ahead to figure out what agenda he's pushing and how he would benefit. Fortunately, i might be able to go back to read Ouspensky to read Gurdjieff with a less skeptical eye after reading  urlLink this article .  It surprised me to find that only in the first few pages of  urlLink Meetings...  that he references Gilgamesh. He claims that  urlLink his father knew of the tale  through a completely oral tradition that survived through the centuries, independent of the clay cuneiform tablets that were discovered later. I'm assuming Bill had already read this passage when we were discussing the flood myths, and i want to know why he didn't mention it, the tricky bastard.

						   The charcoal that the artifacts were found in is dated from anywhere from 25,000 to 30,000 years old. The site's in South Carolina. Three other pre-Clovis sites in North America are acknowledged by the people who are not Clovis zealots, Meadowcroft, Pennsylvania, and  urlLink Cactus Hill  and Saltville in Virginia.   Yeah, keep pushing those dates back...

						   I went to hang out with Damien, Betsy, and Star on Thursday, mostly to make certain that Acid Pro was installed properly on their computer. Damien had a stack of his albusm that he's recently transferred to CD for me, almost all songs i know by heart, but neglect to include as his official discography, considering lost or scrapped. Lark exists side by side with Tale of a Shadow, along with Moonfield, All three of these were to be the followup to Sunfield, but while i knew that he recorded all of the songs, somehow they seemed unfinished and neglected. Wrong. I think that i had become accustomed to the homemade covers that he made for Sunfield and Jinx. Now i have images and clearly defined track listings for each of these albums. They have the justice they deserve.   Although it was not quite my favorite collection, i now have another Damien Youth album for what seemed like a lost period, Happy, a sprawling double album that was recorded around the same time that  urlLink Walter Ghoul's Lavender Brigade  was first getting off the ground. This was the true post Featherbox fallout album, as i can feel him slipping in a few of his still peculiar radio friendly FB songs, WGLB sketches, the unusually stark and brittle DY solo material, and some songs that don't fit anywhere else in his canon, that nearly qualify for novelties.   The stuff from when i first met Damien, around '89 and '90, Mortuary and The Man Who Invented God, is strange to hear again. I still very much like it, but i remember years and years of Hammondites dismissing any newer songs as derivative of this powerful early material. If Damien played Hammond tonight, and had his old crowd miraculously show up (as some fo them lost interest awhile back when he lost interest in playing the same old requests,) he'd get requests for these fifteen year old songs that are clearly not as good as the music he's cranking out now.   Kyte has even been revived, an abandoned Blackberry Records project that was recorded in the same period as Jinx and  urlLink Magic Island .   I don't know what to listen to first.

						   I've been meaning to comment on Bill's comment on PKD being crazy, and that some of his claims might be worth dismissing because he was crazy. I'm not convinced that insanity is any reason to dismiss anything outright. Yes, anything said by someone mentally ill is suspect, but i doubt if it's unnecesarrily untrue. I don't mean to turn myself into a relativist, and retreat by a barricade of declarations about  urlLink consensus reality , but i don't believe that everything a schizophrenic experiences is unreal, and some of it is actual useful information.   As someone who has been forcibly institutionalized against his will under questionable circumstances, i am sympathetic to the  urlLink anti-psychiatry  movement.

						   I don't know how this fits into my childish notions about the true antiquity of civilized humans, but anything that pushes the rise of an agrarian society further back in time has to be worth something. Wouldn't this mean that  urlLink the Natufian culture  probably was familiar with agriculture after all?

						   I have read VALIS by Mr. Dick, and was appalled at its butchering of gnosticism.  I had also heard that he went crazy and that his final three books were written as a sort of coping mechanism.  This, however, blew my mind:   Most observers of this phenomenon would conclude that Dick's visions were a brief psychotic episode, and they might be correct in that assumption.  However, what has allowed the mystery of Dick's experiences to endure are reports of several even more intriguing incidences.  At one point, during an encounter with the VALIS, Dick learned that his infant son was in danger of perishing from an unnamed malady.  Routine checkups on the child had shown no trouble or illness; however, Dick insisted that thorough tests be run to ensure his son's health. The doctor eventually complied, despite the fact that there were no apparent symptoms.  During the examination doctors discovered an inguinal hernia, which would have killed the child if an operation was not quickly performed. The child survived thanks to the operation, which Dick accredited to the VALIS.  Another event was an episode of glossolalia.  Dick's wife transcribed the sounds she heard him speak, and Dick wrote that they later discovered that he was speaking an ancient dialect of the Greek language, which he had never studied.    I would be curious to see documentation.  Note that Dick was the main source for these incredible stories... I'm not one to immediately dismiss somebody, but the guy was crazy.  I wonder if anything else has been written on this?

						   They are convinced it's a hoax with that damned Cardan grille. What's peculiar is that the researcher believes that in trying to break whatever cryptography is in use, or replicate the hoax, it demonstrates the nature of human problem solving, and possibly giving insight into the failings of the scientific method.

						   Well, I am leaving the shores of the great U S of A on Sat. the 26th.  As the trip approaches, my nervousness regarding the plane ride as well as my excitement about the trip itself grows.  A few of the things I'm most looking forward to:  - The  urlLink catacombs of Rome .  I am really expecting to be very moved by the catacombs.  I have studied church history for years and finally  touching  it will perhaps mark a turning point in my life.  Holy ground?  But of course.  -  urlLink St. Peter's Basilica , Vatican City.  The largest church in the world, lots of Bernini, the Pope... I'm sure I'll be impressed. The link is a very sleek photo tour- definitely worth a looksee.  -  urlLink St. Mark's , Venice.  Now THIS is what I am looking forward to.  The last Byzantine basilica in the West...  I am salivating just thinking about it.  It is my understanding that I'll actually be sleeping in it's shadow while I'm in Venice.  - Zurich, Switzerland.  I have a rendevous with a beautiful lady planned...   - Germany... not sure what to expect here.  We'll see.

						   Out of snobbery, I have willfully neghlected comics as an art form since the "Maximum Carnage" run in the Spider Man books.  Years later, I stumbled upon Hellboy and liked it--as a diversion.  Now I have been blessed with The Invisibles, a Grant Morrison series that is pure fucking genius.    It's all here, folks: Invocation of John Lennon as a demigod, a raving hobo who turns out to be a wiseman, conspiracy theory, the Marquis de Sade, Hindu deities, cannibalism, adventure, acid tripping, mimes, cross-dressers, molotov cocktails, jokes involving obscure early figures in the Bolshevik revolution... and this is all in the FIRST OMNIBUS.  Many thanks to Brett (again).    Let's see.  Brett has recommended: Foucault's Pendulum (genius), The Invisibles (genius), Damien Youth (borderline genius), and the whole blog thing (um, genius).  Score- 4  In return, I've turned him onto: Borges (genius), The Manuscript Found in Saragossa (trippy), Gurdjieff (we'll see), Ouspensky (ditto).  Score- 2 1/2 (one point for Borges and three half-points for the others...)  I owe you one.

						   I finished this book last night.  Since this was my first taste of Orhan Pamuk, I'm not sure how it stacks up to the rest of his work.  I will say that I liked the book and I do plan to reread it.    Going in, I expected a book that dealt overtly with the issues of identity, East vs West, and the slave-master relationship.  All of these issues were indeed covered, but the treatment was subtle.  Pamuk, rather than beating us over the head with his "message", really let the philosophizing recede into the background.  Only in the last chapter were the themes really discussed in an overt fashion.  The story is ostensibly a text composed in the early 17th century and found in the 1980s.  The narrator, a Venetian slave in Instanbul, is captured and eventually given to a Turkish philosopher who happens to look exactly like himThe two collaborate on "projects" for the Sultan, into whose favor Hoja, the Turkish philospher, desperately seeks to fall.  As the years pass, the two become more and more alike.  A crisis finally causes them to trade places... or do they?  A few thoughts:  - The concept of "science" in the book is ambiguous and is at times almost a bogeyman.  It was invoked almost as a deity at times, and I thought that the awe with which Hoja regarded "western knowledge" was a neat trick.  Pamuk seems to be saying that in the East, new and potentially powerful knowledge replaces "God" as a concept.  In the West, the argument can be made that "God" has become just another Cartesian category that some are concerned with and others are not.    - The relationship between the two men was odd.  They were not friends, and yet the slave-master relationship was not totally present either.  Hoja's interrogation of the Venetian (it is odd that I cannot recall his name...was it even given?) read like introspection.  When the time came for the two to "switch", I found myself thinking that it was unnecessary.  Maybe I was reading it too literally...  - The "switch" itself recalled Borges... it was not a change of identity, but Hoja took the Italian's past and the Italian (the name thing is really bothering me) took Hoja's future.  That added a dimension of uncertainty.  Was the change real?   - The final chapter was certainly the strongest of the book.  While John Updike (the windbag) writes in a blurb that Pamuk's "intelligence and introspection suggest Proust", I am more inclined to compare the book's themes to Borges.  But then again I was never able to slog through Proust, so John Updike might be right.  This last thought was pointless.  I recommend the book, but "My Name Is Red" by the same author seems like the better place to start.  Writing this review makes me think that I need to reread the book to really get a handle on it.  B+ for now...

						   So I woke up at 7:45 PM thinking it was 7:45 AM.... I was about to get in the shower and drive to work, but I noticed that my roomate was up.  I asked him if it was the "morning time" and he started ridiculing me.  The day seemed really long after that.  I am the only person I know who is both an insomniac AND a narcoleptic.  My friend Chris aka Anonymous Rex (oops) were talking about Gnosticism tonight.  He was wondering why dualism thrived in proto-Christian religions like Manicheism, Valentinian Gnosticism, Sabeanism, etc. etc.   We agreed that dualism was a holdover from other near eastern religions.  Our theory assumes, of course, that Gnosticism is NOT a Christian heresy per se.  It is from the perspective of Christians, naturally, but the fact that dualistic sects flourished prior to the time of Christ leads me to assume that the advent of Christianity merely added fuel to a preexistant fire.    So what's the deal with  urlLink French Stewart ?  I think that guy is a jackass.

						   Despite an initial scare (the guy wasn't home when we first arrived), my visit to the Hattiesburg collector was a rousing success.  We spoke for hours and in the end I walked out with a great stack of books.  I'll return to visit him in a few weeks.  Acuired:  The Ebony Tower by John Fowles, 1st edition.  Jorge Luis Borges: A Literary Biography by Emil Rodríguez Monegal, 1st edition.  Memed, My Hawk by Yashar Kemal, 1st edition.  The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor by John Barth, signed 1st edition.  I also talked the guy out of eight or so books on comparative religion, the history of alchemy, mysticism, and Meister Eckhart.  I was pleasently suprised to see that the three Mircea Eliade books I obtained were all fist editions and are all quite valuable.  Not bad for a buck apiece.    Here's the kicker, though.  I held in my hands books that I will NEVER see again, much less touch.  Among the highlights were the British and American firsts of The Satanic Verses, Fowles' The Collector and The Magus in the British firsts, a chinese translation of Joyce's Ulysses... the list goes on and on.  The collector himself, Dr. Herzinger, is focusing on "everyone worth a damn" after 1975.  He has a large bookcase with the first two books of a given author in the first edition.  All the usual suspects were there.  Eugenides, Carver, Amis, Coetzee, pretty much anyone you can think of.  Our disagreements were few:  He thought that Fowles "wouldn't stand the test of time" and I thought that Dave Eggers is a pretentious bullshitter, but other than that our tastes seemed similar.   All in all well worth the trip.

						   I once had a professor who hated  urlLink Bishop Berkeley . It was a survey course of philosophy. She had been heaping praise on every thinker she had introduced to us, until she reached Berkeley. The amount of contempt that she spewed upon him pushed me into wanting to defend him, out of contrariness. I quite liked his notion that the reason why the universe exists as it does, without blinking out of existence the moment that it is no longer perceived by a consciousness is because there  is  a constant consciousness present, that god character. It fit into something that i think that i understand from popular science books on quantum physics theory.   Against Berkeley's original ideas though, i never could accept that humans can perceive anything objectively and accurately.   Now i've read Jorge Luis Borges'  urlLink Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius .  Now i don't quite know what to think. What philosophy or religion has god as a fragmented consciousness, broken up to perceive the universe in every possible variation? Buddhist or Hindu, i believe, but i reduce everything to its simplest conception out of laziness.  urlLink Borges' Tlön  could only exist as the projection of a homogenous consciousness.   None of this is new to me, but i feel as if i was handed my own conception of reality on a silver platter, and i have to wrestle my way backwards on why certain things cannot be true. I'm glad to have people like Borges around to simplify it in an engaging fashion.

						   Finished that biography of Jack Kirby. Although i have a deep respect for the man, when before he was just a name, i am absolutely disgusted with the comic book industry. The bits where the book related who created what, how ideas and characters evolved, which companies made which innovations, and Kirby's time in World War 2... all of that had me hooked. However, a lot of the book was about the numerous ugly disputes over money and ownership. Comic books are deeply ugly and exploitative. I'm not sure if i want to learn any more about this subject, as it leaves everything i like about the medium tasting of ashes. I don't know how people like Alan Moore, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, and all of these slavish homage payers can stomach the mess. Perhaps they feel that they are serving justice somehow, but it feels pyrrhic.

						   I have been in Hattiesburg for the past two days.  My purpose was dual-- I needed to see some friends and I needed to acquire some books.  Mission: Accomplished.  I got a signed first edition of James Lee Burke's  urlLink Cadillac Jukebox , a pristine first edition of Margaret Atwood's  urlLink The Blind Assassin , and a first edition of Clancy's  urlLink Clear and Present Danger .  Total expenditure- $24.79.  Amazing.  And just when I think I can sit back and relax, another opportunity.  It seems that a Hattiesburg bibliophile and professor is getting rid of his collection. He has been collecting for 40 years and has accumulated over 7000 volumes. My associate John acquired a few choice firsts this evening.  He convinced me that it was worth a return trip.    The plan:  Drive to Hattiesburg (2 1/2 hrs) tomorrow morning, buy books.  Drive to Jackson (1 1/2 hrs), pick up new glasses.  Do laundry, sleep.  Drive back here.  This will complete a five day marathon of exhaustion, delirium, astute book purchasing, and surreal Steve Winwood fandom.  I have lived, my friends.  I have lived.  An open question:  My trip to "The Old World" is looming.  Should I try to give a blog-account as I go or wait until I return to update the masses (aka Brett)?  Cast your votes!!!!

						   Jean Baudrillard.  The simulation of something which never really existed.    Umberto Eco.  The authentic fake.    Jorge Luis Borges.  On Exactitude in Science ...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.   Wanna know a secret? While i admire all of these crazy notions about the real and the hyperreal, it's like dividing the world into black and white arbitrarily. I'm not well read enough to know whether any of these men are acknowledging that "real" is in any way something objective and measurable. Humans only see in a certain range of the light spectrum.  Only with instruments designed in the past couple of centuries have humans been able to perceive radiation exists that cannot be seen with the unaided human eye. I don't even trust the human eye.   I don't understand enough to know whether they are tryign to say that all reality is hyperreality. It bugs me a little too, in that it could wind up owing something to Plato's cave allegory. I don't believe that  forms  bullshit for a moment.  And how could this tie into the universe being holographic?

						   Two books that i've enjoyed more than i probably should have, because of their deep entrenchment in American pop culture are  urlLink The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay  and  urlLink Fortress of Solitude . I'm beginning to cultivate an interest in just how some of these pop culture icons evolved, even if the actual comic books may bore me senseless. Lethem even wrote  urlLink an essay fleshing out his comic book fetish in the '70s , how it defined his adolescence.    I'm a few pages into Tales to Astonish, and it's amusing just how much Chabon lifted in whole cloth from real life for his own comic book novel. Chabon never disguised it, but it's still surprising me.

I still find a good conspiracy or hoax useful.   This seems to be  urlLink the introduction of the book .  (Remember, i'm not an atheist either, Bill)  I am finding it annoying that a lot of the sites that believe that they are refuting the claims of Maccaby are using the very questionable words of that dodgy shyster Paul to do it. If someone like me has no faith in Paul or his forgers, this is intolerable.

						   The English speaking world will be blessed with a new book by  urlLink Umberto Eco .  Set to be released in December,   urlLink On Literature  will break Eco's English language silence.    From the publisher:   In this collection of essays and addresses delivered over the course of his illustrious career, Umberto Eco seeks "to understand the chemistry of [his] passion" for the word. From musings on Ptolemy and "the force of the false" to reflections on the experimental writing of Borges and Joyce, Eco's luminous intelligence and encyclopedic knowledge are on dazzling display throughout. And when he reveals his own ambitions and superstitions, his authorial anxieties and fears, one feels like a secret sharer in the garden of literature to which he so often alludes.  Remarkably accessible and unfailingly stimulating, this collection exhibits the diversity of interests and the depth of knowledge that have made Eco one of the world's leading writers.    When do we get a new novel?

						   As a young man interested in the Kabbalah and Gnosticism, the most difficult task is finding a balanced, learned, and serious study devoid of any seedy new age or pop-spirituality elements.  For the Kabbalah, the choice is clear.  The late Gershom Scholem is by far the most reputable and scholarly figure in the field.  I own the following:   urlLink Kabbalah - A large book arranged thematically.  Covers concepts, history, and personalities.      urlLink On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism -A collection of essays dealing with aspects of the Kabbalah.  The first essay in the book, "Religious Authority and Mysticism" is a wonderful intro to the topic from a general standpoint, with comments on the particular features of the Kabbalah's relationship to Judaism as a whole.   urlLink Origins of the Kabbalah -  Perhaps the best place to start.  Title is self explanatory.  My copy comes from the personal library of  urlLink Israel Otto Lehman .    See also:   urlLink Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism    urlLink On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead    urlLink The Zohar    For Gnosticism, the choices are less clear.  Elaine Pagels is a media darling and is considered THE authority, but her work manifests (in my opinion) revisionist scholarship at its worst.  I do not hesitate to recommend one of her earliest works, however:   urlLink The Gnostic Paul - This one is GREAT.  It provides a gnostic exegesis of Paul's epistles.  Brett- this one is sure to get that head spinning.  I own it if you'd like to borrow it.   urlLink Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism - One can always rely on the Germans to come out with a cold, analytical, scholarly analysis of a particular subject.  Gnosticism is no different. No New Age mumbo jumbo here.  As always, it is good to have recourse to the sources:    urlLink The Nag Hammadi Library - a modern English translation.

						   This adds little to the site that Bill has already posted. I'm looking for a mention of the chimerical botany illustrations being a key to whatever cipher is being used in the rest of the text, like Trithemius and his invocation of angels. Do different combinations of real plants to create a fantastical one instruct the intended reader to switch to a different key?   Yeah, yeah, i know the most recent news is that Edward Kelley probably forged it, but even if it's a hoax, how complete is it?

						   I've been mucking about this morning, trying to find more evidence to pin the blame for many of the ills of western civilization on Paul of Tarsus. (I have an irrational hatred for this opportunist motherfucker. It's gone beyond reason, as i would scapegoat him for ill-fitting shoes if the whim hit me.) The concept of  urlLink divine right  is my project for this morning, and it's tedious. I cannot believe that anyone bought this nonsense for a moment. One of my formative moments as an almost-adult was in an algebra class, when a teacher chose to discipline me by having me write the lines, "I will obey those in authority because God put them there." She probably got it from  urlLink the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans .   (and we had to wait for Voltaire for the introduction of Dr. Pangloss?)  Forget the past.  urlLink Bush is reviving the cause of divine right .   (We already know that his buddy  urlLink Scalia is a supporter of this revival .  urlLink (ahem.) )

						   I was sitting here wondering how best to address the differences between Brett and myself on the question of religion.  I condsidered a lengthy point-counterpoint post with plenty of erudite references and high-falutin' language, but I have decided that that would serve no purpose, and would likely confuse matters even more.  I have settled on the following, then.  Our disagreement on the dating (and the importance) of the Epic of Gilgamesh called up a Sufi story I had read.    THE RESTAURATEUR  A man once opened a restaurant with a good kitchen, attractive tables and an excellent menu.  One of his friends came along soon afterwards and said:  "Why have you not got a sign like all the other eating-places?  I suggest you put on it "RESTAURANT: FINEST FOOD."  When the sign was painted and put up, another enquirer asked: "Why are you not more specific?  You could mean any old restaurant.  Add the words "SERVED HERE" and the sign will be complete."  The owner thought that this was a good idea, and he had the signboard duly altered.  Not long afterwards someone else came along and said: "Why do you put "HERE"?  Surely anyone can see where the food is served?"  So the owner had the sign changed.  Presently a further curious member of the public wanted to know: "Do you not know that the word "SERVED" is redundant?  All restaurants and shops serve.  Why not take it out?"  So that word was taken out.  Now another visitor said: "If you continue to use the phrase "FINEST FOOD", some may accuse you of arrogance, others might not agree.  To avoid criticism and contention, remove the word "FINEST"."  And so he did.  Now just the word "FOOD"  was to be seen on the sign, and a sixth individual put his head through the doorway.  "Why have you got the word "FOOD" on your restaurant? Anyone can see you serve food here."  So the Restaurateur took down the sign.  As he did so he could not help wondering when someone who was hungry, rather than curious or intellectual, would come along...   I suppose I'm trying to say that I'm hungry.  Does the relative chronology of the book of Genesis and an Akkadian epic matter much to my faith?  Not really.  I see most of that as "changing the sign" without bothering to try the food.  This of course brings up the wider issue of "faith vs. reason".  You mentioned in the commentary on the Gilgamesh post that I was "operating from faith rather than reason."  While I may disagree with you on that specific point (I'm not sure that you have proven that the Genesis account is a ripoff of the Gilgamesh account--have you read them both?), I will readily agree that there are  many  instances where I may believe something that is "irrational".  Religion is not a math equation.    So what's the deal?  We will likely touch on this issue over and over again over the course of our collaboration, so I will satisfy myself with a very brief gloss:  Olivier Clement once wrote that "history, including the history of Christianity, is littered with chariactures of God."  In my studies (and I'll say again that I have spent a great deal of time in my "search"), I have found that most of these chariactures arose and currently thrive in the West.  From the social God of southern culture, to the "buddy Jesus" of mealy-mouthed Protestantism, to the cold God of the "philosphers", I've been forced time and time again to reevaluate what I've been taught, what I thought I knew, and what I  can  know.    I am finding myself more and more drawn to Orthodox Christianity.  Christianity, after all, is an EASTERN religion.  Suffice it to say that the difference between Eastern and Western Christianity is much larger than I initially suspected.  The Orthodox have retained the "inner" Christianity.  They adhere to Tradition, they manifest Tradition, they practice the "faith of the fathers".  When confronted with literally thousands of shades of Christianity, it became important for me to identify the Church that Christ founded on earth.    "But he didn't found a church! He was the ultimate anti-institutionalist.  How DARE you suggest that there can POSSIBLY be a valid AUTHORITY in matters of religion?"    My studies have confirmed me in one thing:  I don't know anything.  And I certainly don't know enough to ascribe to MYSELF any sort of religious authority.  Do I trust my own uneducated and tentative interpretation of the scriptures?  Hell no.  Do I consider myself holy?  Quite the opposite.  Does holiness even exist today?  Sure.    "But institutionalized/organized religion is CORRUPT."  Sure it is.  It is human, and things mixed up with humanity tend to come out the worse for it.  I don't need perfection.  That's a pipe dream.   "What about the suppression and systematic censorship of 'early Christianity'?"  Pick an issue and we'll explore it.  Deal?   In my visits to Father Elia, one of the first things he said to me was burned very vividly into my memory.  "Being of the opinion that Jesus is the Son of God is not enough to be a Christian".   I like the exhortation in Luke:  "But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade me cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.  For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted (14:10-11).

						   I'm reading Gurdjieff's "Meetings With Remarkable Men" and two things really jumped out at me last night.    Gurdjieff, who was if nothing else a truly  urlLink interesting man , apparently became dissastisfied with the materio-scientific view of the universe when he was confronted with supernatural phenomena in his youth that he simply could not find an explanation for. Some of the earliest phenomena occurred among the  urlLink Yezidis .  These people, with whom I was previously unacquainted, are apparently still the object of some controversy.  Are they pagans, Sufi spinoffs, or something else entirely?    As if that were not enough, Gurdjieff claims to have found traces of the Sarmoung Brotherhood.  Check  urlLink this link  for his search (the whole page is interesting, see particularly the interactive map of Ani).   urlLink Here  is another link.  My question is this: Has anyone seen this parchment, or do we simply have to trust a confessed wiseacre?

						   Bill & i are in a mild disagreement over Gilgamesh. I insist that it's much older than the the books that became the Old Testament, and he says that they are roughly contemporaneous. Neither of us were well served by our bookstore, as all we had to go by was a Joseph Campbell mythology book and light survey book on empires that is too sketchy to provide any bibiliography or sources.   It appears that we are going ot have to do a lot of research and debting, as we're not going to find any history books that we are both going to accept easily. I found  urlLink this page  that pushes the dates much further back than we compromised upon last night.

						   The results are in:   Overall prevalence varies widely (Table 2), from 4.3% in Shanghai to 26.4% in the United States, with a 9.1% to 16.9% inter-quartile range (IQR, the range after excluding the highest and lowest 4 surveys). Anxiety disorders are the most common disorders in all but 1 country (higher prevalence of mood disorders in Ukraine), with prevalence in the range 2.4% to 18.2% (IQR, 5.8%-8.8%). Mood disorders are next most common in all but 2 countries (equal or higher prevalence of substance disorders in Nigeria and Beijing), with prevalence in the range 0.8% to 9.6% (IQR, 3.6%-6.8%). Substance disorders (12-month prevalence, 0.1%-6.4%; IQR, 0.8%-2.6%) and impulse-control disorders (12-month prevalence, 0.0%-6.8%; IQR, 0.7%-1.7%) are consistently less prevalent across the surveys. If we use the terms high and low to refer to the 5 highest and 5 lowest prevalence estimates in each column of the table, the United States and Colombia have consistently high prevalence estimates across all classes of disorder, the Netherlands and Ukraine are high on 3 of 4, Nigeria and Shanghai are consistently low, and Italy is low on 3 of 4.

						   Heraclitus of Ephesos! It's strange that he's a proponent of  logos , of a rational and comprehensible universe, as i think of him akin to the Gnostics. When he talks about Fire, i think energy, and wonder if he had the whole thing figured out after all, that it is only the numbers and formulas that need to be nailed down.   It also irks me that he's a proponent of war, but i can probably pervert that tendency to suit my own ends.

						   Keep up those connections to Turkey.

(It was from  urlLink a Blavatsky piece .)    urlLink This is quite a cool link , in that it deconstructs what evidence of the man that has trickled down through the centuries, providing a rational critical analysis. I wish that there were more detectives like this online.

						   Believe it or not, I have a Walloon story.  I mentioned a few days ago on this blog that I found an old journal of mine that I had written in when I was about sixteen.  Like most American teenagers, I was very interested in the Eighty Years War, also called the Dutch Revolt or the Dutch War of Independence.  I say "interested" and I mean "interested".  I even went so far as to purchase  urlLink this remarkably overpriced volume  from those price-gougers over at  urlLink Brill .  I might add that it was a tad more expensive than $52.00 when I bought it...  But I digress.  Pasted in my journal is a neatly clipped line-drawn depiction of one of the countless little skirmishes over fortified hills, this particular one in the environs around Zeeland.  Written above one of the ranks of pikemen arrayed behind a low wall, clear as day, is the appellation "Wallonisch".  Right there in my old journal.  I wish I had a scanner.  "Walloon" itself is linguistically related to the german  welsch  and the English  welsh , meaning "stranger" or "foreigner".  The Walloons of south Belgium speak a dialect of French which distinguished them linguistically from their northern Flemish neighbors.  Many Walloon families remained Catholic during the Wars of Religion in the 16th and 17th centuries, but by the time the Dutch began arriving in America, all Dutch Protestants in the New World were known as "Walloons".    As much as I'd like to read  urlLink Walloon literature , I'm afraid it is far outside of my linguistic ability.    Do note the bit in that article above about the Walloons being "in general characterized by greater vivacity and adaptability than their Flemish neighbors, while they excel their French neighbors in endurance and industry".  There have been few better excuses for an intense national pride.  Adaptable AND Resiliant?  Vivacious AND Industrious?  Long live the Walloons!!!!!

						   Over the past year, I have rededicated myself to reading fiction.  Prior to that, I was a strictly non-fiction guy.  Working at the bookstore has made me realize that I have a lot of catching up to do.    Since I began reading fiction again, I've acquired new tastes.  I was an unrepentant champion of Russian Lit.  Nothing else compared.  Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Gogol were the only authors worth mentioning to me (although I had a hearty respect for Anthony Burgess and I STILL maintain that he is extremely underrated).  A series of indulged whims and urgent recommendations broke me out of my Russian Lit elitism and I am the better for it by far.  I read Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" on a whim and loved it.  I was introduced to Borges and John Fowles by my lovely and beautiful former co-worker Natali.  The combination of thoughts evoked by Borges and my rereading of "The Name of the Rose" finally drove me to "Foucault's Pendulum" (helped along all the while by Brett's exhortations).    From Borges I stumbled upon Milorad Pavic, and from Pavic I have devoted myself to reading every bit of Balkan Literature I can get my grubby hands on.  Mesa Selimovic, Ivo Andric, Danilo Kis, Ismail Kadare...   From the Balkan stuff I have proceeded even further east: into Turkey and the Levant.   urlLink Amin Maalouf , a Lebanese Catholic author living in France has lots of extremely interesting  urlLink stuff .  I'm reading "Balthasar's Odessey" right now.     urlLink Orhan Pamuk , a Turkish author who marries Eastern thought and culture-clash issues with postmodern  experimentation, is another new interest.  He is compared favorably to Borges, Eco, and Kundera (who is the poster boy for pretension among twentysomething readers.  Yes, I have read him).  See his works in English   urlLink here .  I ordered "My Name is Red" and "The White Castle" last night.  I am eternally grateful to Ms. Natali Mitova for helping to set this chain reaction into motion.  I'm always open to new recommendations, comments, or criticisms.  Shoot me an email with any or all of them.

						   Just when I thought it was safe to ignore odd alchemical texts....   urlLink The Voynich Manuscript  was brought to my attention by a reader (soon to be collaborator).  Apparently this baby is indecipherable.  A quick glance at the text makes me think of reverse-writing.  Has anyone tried holding it up to a mirror?  The site above is pretty thorough, touching on the postulated authorship by Roger Bacon, the connection to  urlLink John Dee  (which links this manuscript by association to the greater history of Western Occultism), and all the hoax theories.    Since no one knows what the hell the manuscript is about, it remains little more than a curiosity.  It's held at the Rare Books Library at Yale, whcih brings up the question of why those Ivy League bastards who wrote the Rule of Four ignored this to write about the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.  For the newest Voynich Hoax theory see  urlLink this site .

						   Walter Ghoul's lavender Brigade... Is Coming! (196?)*  As of right now, this is hands down my favorite Damien Youth-affiliated disc.  DY and Brett's cousin Zane/Derrick collaborated on this collection of faux-psychedelia, and it WORKS!  I cannot get most of these songs out of my head.  Front to back, the album is consistent, solid, well-played, well-arranged, and melodic.   For a little background,  urlLink check this site out.   As soon as you do, buy the CD from the website.  It's that good.  As I've said before, I'm not a fan of the 60's psychedelic music, although if it all sounds like this, I might get into it.  As a layman previously unexposed, I can honestly say that I was floored.  If you are a psychedelia junkie, some of these songs will likely sound familiar to you.  DY is a master of teasing themes out of prior works and making them his own.  Friends of mine thought they heard echoes of "Penny Lane" in WGLB's "When She Came Around".  Syd Barret's ghost floats through "Glass Room".  There's enough here to keep influence-hunters busy for years.    The disc starts strong.  "House of Small", which was apparently released as a separate single, is a song that sets the tone for the rest of the record.  The version of the disc I have has a stripped down, lower key version of the song tacked onto the end.  I prefer this latter one myself, but the "official version" is great as well.    "Glass Room" is the first track that really grabbed me. It is STILL in my head. As always, DY manages to evoke atmosphere effortlessly with bare-bones production values and liberal use of effects.  I get chills when the chorus kicks in:      I'm losing hold on everyone Sittin' up late in the Glass Room counting stars   "When She Came Around" is a brilliant little pop song that you'll find yourself humming at work or while driving.   Other definite keepers include "Stop" (which ends fucking perfectly...) and "Julia", another effects-laden love-fest.  There are no bad songs on the disc.  "Hey Mary Jane" is a tad annoying to me, and "Old Man Arthur", while haunting, feels uneven.  All in all, an A+ disc.  It's a shame that this stuff isn't all over the place.

						   more fun from our friends the Situationists. FUCK the aristocracy of the caves! Fuck Plato too for good measure! Gooddamned troglodytes! I will stare down the searing light of ten thousand suns!     1) I promise that I shall never, personally, under any circumstances set foot in an atomic shelter. It is better to die standing with all the cultural heritage of humanity, the perpetual modification of which must be our task. The labour movement was once considered to be the salt of the earth. Today it is more like a milch cow, whose udders are being pumped in an effort to get more and more material benefits - at the expense of the mind.   2) I refuse to have anything whatsoever to do with the aristocracy of the caves, and never to drink in the company of an owner or a builder of an atomic shelter; for this subterranean aristocracy, even if it man-ages to survive the disaster, will be of the quality of sewer rats, and could in no case be considered a continuation of the human race.   3) At this point in our present situation it is not so much the thermonuclear war, but rather the threat of this war, which shows the absolute bankruptcy of all the politi-cians in the world. The capitalist or bureaucratic leaders of both east and west already make use of their bombs every day, in order to secure power for them-selves. Only if one realises that they have placed themselves beyond the law can one establish a new legality. I therefore pledge myself not to expect the necessary upheavals of society by any of the existing formations of specialized politics.

						   Just to irritate Bill a little more... Dershowitz is more than a bit nuts, but i found this anecdote on  urlLink Eschaton  a couple of weeks ago, about my very favorite justice, Antonin Scalia:   He's an interesting guy. His father was a teacher at Brooklyn college when I was there. His father was a proud member of the American-Italian fascist party and got his doctorate at Casa Italiano at Columbia at a time when in order to get your doctorate you had to swear an oath to Mussolini. So he comes from an interesting background and he went to a kind of military school in New York which was a place where many children of fascists were educated. Therefore to call him a conservative - he's never expressed any conservative priniciples - he's a statist. He's a man who is well in the tradition of Franco and Mussolini. Not Hitler. He's not an anti-Semite - there's no bigotry or racism in him at all. But he is somebody who has these views which would have been very comfortable in fascist Italy or fascist Spain.   Spooky stuff. I also know the loon has also made favorable remarks about the concept of the divine right of heads of state, that they are picked by the hand of God himself, and democracy and the will of the people undermine that "truth".   Now I find out that  urlLink the thuggish bastard has ties to Opus Dei , even though they insist that he is not a member.   John Paul I would have never cuddled up to these vicious swine. That's why they killed him.   I'm also finding ties to Opus Dei and the Contras, versus the Jesuits and the Sandinistas... weird, weird, weird...

We still have quite a first editions of this damned thing around. It's bound to at least go up by $30 in value. I hate buying purely by speculation, and not by quality. One would think that i would have learned my lesson in comic books.

						   I haven't been sleeping too well because of this cold, but last night was extremely peculiar. Potocki's getting his hooks deep into my brain. My inability to focus on what i'm reading has almost been an asset, in that i keep having to go back to check to make certain i didn't transpose characters and places. All last night, i had the nagging feeling that absolutely nothing is to be trusted or believed. I kept waking up to walk around the apartment to check for clues that the life i believe that i have is not some peculiarly detailed fantasy  Then again, one time when i had a very high fever, i hallucinated a man with a stag's antlers looming over the foot of my bed. Folk stories, myths, and fairy tales are even more ingrained in my nature from my days in the Amite public library than Fortean and occult weirdness.

						   I've been working on some articles to self. One is called "the anomaly factor". I've been a party to many discussions about the origins of humans, the religious giving all the credit to the largest thing they can think of, an all knowing, omnipotent being & the science minded giving credit to the tiniest of particles. The religious give a compelling argument that pulls at the very heart, all stirring the emotions. The science minded gives an equally compelling theory, one that has the mind reeling with possibilities. Both seem to have one thing in common, an agenda. I've tried VERY hard to not have an agenda so, I argue with both sides just to see how deep their waters run.  An atheist friend of mine said "It was not his job to disprove a god, any more than it was to disprove the existence of peter pan. It was, instead, the job of those who made up such an obnoxious being to prove it." I told him, "I don't know about proving, but..They are doing a great job at convincing." I went on to tell him, breaking down a form to the tiniest particle of it's make up & then noting the function of each tiny particle is not a good argument AGAINST a god. (Which is his method of arguing his side.) It's rather like, taking a great painting, dissecting it in a lab, telling us what chemicals made up the paints, what fabrics were used to make up the canvas and then once you have it all broken down to it's tiniest of particle, you still have no answer when one asks, "But what can you tell me about the artist who painted it?"  On the other side of the fence, I've noted that not one person has ever argued with me about the pro-existence of a god with out using "Order" as the foundation of their "proof" argument. Just like the non believer uses chaos &amp; random theories to prove no one is in control, there for, there is no god. The Godless man points to the injustice of dying children, successful criminals, career murderers, lying super powers, that rule both the political & religious worlds. And just as you are starting to see it his way, you think... That makes since, but what is since? And isn’t something qualifying itself as "making since" in itself subject to some form of order? I mean, if he’s speaking against order &amp; I can easily follow the order of his thought flow, isn’t it all self defeating? Wouldn’t his anti argument work much better if he simply stated, "aluminum sulfate is the highest quantum material known to the paraplegic giraffe and this has been proven in a quart of lard, further more, all of this talk of god has given me a terrible case of the claps and if I had a safety pin... I could prove that there is no such thing as geese and that’s the way that cookie bounces, so...go on now.. You’ve buttered your bread, now go on & lie in it!" ..?  Back to the pro-creation ilk. To them, God wants order, when things get out of order then it must be destroyed, or manipulated, in order to maintain order. These people will point to order in nature as proof that their must be a god, for without something orchestrating nature, how can order happen? Some even get poetic with it, claiming, "to understand the language of nature is to speak with god. To be able to interpret the brave heart of a lion, the cunning of the panther, the nobility of the willow or the wisdom of the serpent, is to begin to understand the nature of god all mighty." That's all very lovely but, what about the other side of nature. What about the sliminess of slugs? the hideousness of cockroaches? the pointlessness of love bugs? or even more, what about the lying, greedy, egotistical nature of the being that claims it self the most god like of all in nature? the human being?! What does this tell us of god? Oh yea &amp; what about toe jam, schmegma, genital warts, pee, pee & poo, poo, boogers &amp; snot and last of all Jimmy Buffet! "Forget all of that! Products of sin!" Says the holy man. Christ says "Consider the lilies of the field..." If I had been there when/if Christ said that, I would have said, "Yes, JC, let’s consider them shall we... Note how they do nothing but bring beauty to the fields, yet still they will fold and die in the blistering winds of your winter, some will be trodden under foot or most unjustly, ripped from the ground in their prime, by some testosterone driven, pimple faced oaf and handed clumsily to some unsuspecting, ditzy, nymph, as if it were some pre-payment for acts of passion, that in most cases, never takes place. Especially if she’s allergic. ... Now, what were you going to say about the lilies, before I so rudely interrupted you...?"  Well, just like the atheist, the religious man most often fails to see the contradictions that unfold in the garden of his own speaking. When you point out that the reason order is so compelling in nature, is because, it can be argued, that it’s so rare an occurrence & that chaos doesn’t rule out the anomaly factor that is order. If you take a hand full of feathers and fling them in the air, they will all land at random. It's chaos in motion! Yet, some will land simultaneously. Is that order? Or synchronized random event? In other words, synchronized chaos?!! A stream of order, jetting stream line through a great chaotic mass.  More later on the anomaly that is order.... Now I must organize my CD collection ;-)   (Which leads to an "off the subject" question, just how many artist do you have in the "Q" section of your collection? Quasi &amp; Queen is about all I have at the moment.. )

						   No, i haven't bought it yet (as the extra discount only kicks in on the first of each month,) but i smuggled it out of the bookstore, as i had to skim some of the essays that caught my eye last night. Borges should have invented hypertext and blogging, as i'd swear that i've read someone else assert. It's bending the gears of my brain to shift from book and film reviews, to the nature of Hell, obscure details of mystic texts, and national character. He doesn't slip from voice to another between his different subjects, addressing everything with equal familiarity and no condescension to his reader. There seems no dividing lines for any discipline. It's overwhelming.

						    I was once told by a naturalist ""Most of us can hardly imagine living truly off the land , but that's really how it was intended to be. It's our most natural state"   I respond:(Avoiding the obvious reply... "Who's intent?")We ARE living off the land. I think it's admirable, and quaint even, to live hand to mouth & I love the concepts of planting seeds &amp; having them grow from the earth to feed us & bring beauty. But, why just live off the land? What about microwaves? Radio waves? All of that grand pulsing existence, invisible to the naked eye, yet so very real. Why is that, in your mind, un-natural? Why not look at all environment as fertile space, just as willing to give &amp; take with our species as the ground? You see, now we have a choice. If we want to live off of the earth, we can drop out and do just that. If we want to wear leather undies, while listening to illegal downloaded music on an mp3 walkman, while writing naughty emails to some fat guy in Sweden, who pretends he's a lonely chick Kandy, well.... we are set up for that as well. And I think this is all a part of nature! Feeding a need in the most efficient manner is progressive nature. We are sometimes so efficient that we now have "free time". Free time itself is a fertile space that allows us to explore our various needs. Once we find one need and it proves to be a common one, we seek to find a way to Facilitate the need. From this, all was spawned &amp; I propose..."all is natural!" It must be, for we are a part of nature. Nature, or what is "natural", isn't something that was determined 2000 years ago, it's still unfolding. All is natural....

						   Found this one on  urlLink Archaeology News  (another daily check-in) but cannot see any hint in the original story that lends to the assertion that this would be a medieval city. This "Kyrgyz Atlantis" label is a little silly, and i doubt whether this is one of those fantastic lost advanced civilizations that i wish that would turn up, but it's certainyl older than just a few centuries. I know almost nothing about  urlLink Kyrgyzstan , other than it being part of  urlLink Tamerlane 's old stomping grounds. Betcha this predates this one by far. Those bronze cauldrons used in sacrifice seem to point to that.    Update....    I made it further into Hedin's book, to find that the major episode in which he nearly died in crossing the Takla-makan desert. The lost city that he found there later was the one where  urlLink Aurel Stein  later discovered manuscripts in the lost  urlLink Tocharian language . This town submerged beneath Lake Issyk-kul could be a remnant of  urlLink the Kushan empire . Then  urlLink this page  turned up, describing great cities there in that desert, and the great clashes between the Tibetan and Chinese armies in the 9th century. Maybe the Lake Issyk-kul town is medieval. Sorry. Still, it mildly surprises me that the Hedin book is covering this exact territory.

						   Just a little more pointless Borges fandom.   In clicking about the Wikipedia (where i've been hanging out all too often online, even though i contribute absolutely nothing to it,) I stumbled on this entry. The library itself no longer exists. The only reason why we know what it consisted of today is because its contents were auctioned off in 1711. It was not that large of a private library, 1500 titles, and it was not the most exotic one to exist, but it serve as an exceptional example of a well-balanced mind.   The entry says that Borges was an admirer of  urlLink Thomas Browne .   I think that i've only heard of a third of the authors (and never knew or heard the titles of the books that they wrote) and have read only a handful of those... and have no great comprehension of anything beyond Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and Milton. Ouch.

						   A bad habit that i've developed since NPR has gone to an all specialty show format is actually listening to it all day. It's a more middlebrow version of talk radio, i know. Sometimes there are even discussions that actually interest me, but most of the time, i'm just paying attention to which way a story is being spun. I'm not going to forget for a long time just how uninformed Neal Conan was when a caller stated that Cheney was supposed to head a task force on terrorism that never met before 9/11, but Conan shut him down, saying that this was not true, as it would have come out before now...  urlLink except this had  always  been out in the open . Conan was just utterly unprepared to lead any discussion on such a topic.   Yesterday, Conan was scoffing mildly at how silly sci-fi fans could believe that anything that goes through a black hole could wind up in another universe. Fine, that's his opinion, but he managed to hinge it on Hawking's pronouncement that information can be transmitted from black holes, that the matter is not destroyed, or shunted off into those other universes, but just trapped. He even said that one cannot argue with a statement by Hawking, so it  must  be true.&nbsp; Was that fucker paying attention?  urlLink Hawking was announcing that for thirty years he had been  wrong  . Why should anyone take anything Hawking says as an absolute truth?   At least Hawking has more credibility than Conan. I never heard him do a followup on his rejection of the existence of the Cheney terrorism task force. Why do we trust these guys?

						   I read on a few websites that the Chartres Cathedral was built on a shrine to the Black Virgin. Umberto Eco even has one of his characters mention this in  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum .

						   During my third day in Rome, we toured the Forum and the Circus Maximus.  When we got to the Mamertine prison, the guide, a Polish-Italian archaeologist, mentioned that the building across the square was rumored to be the place where the Knights Templar kept the Ark of the Covenant for a few months in the 13th century while moving it from Jerusalem to Chartes in France.  She had a pretty interesting theory on where the Ark is now.  She said that in the catherdral at Chartes, which has a  urlLink labyrinth  carved into the floor near the entrance, the knights sent the Ark into what she called "another dimension".  Her english was good, but she had trouble describing this particular idea.    She believes that the knights placed a copper plate over the center of the labyrinth, suspended the Ark (which is believed by some to have been some sort of superconductor, note the passages in the Bible about Moses glowing after being in its presence)in the air over the plate, and then hung some sort of meteor above that.  This combination apparently sent the Ark into this "other dimension", whose existence she said has been proven by "modern experiments".  She was talking about the multiverse theory in quantum cosmology.    Brett determined that this theory is espoused in some detail in Gardner's  urlLink Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark . I disagree with the first reviewer on the Amazon site who says that Gardner's "credentials are impeccable", but who am I?

						   Just spotted this on  urlLink Boing Boing . So what does this mean? Would brain damage of this kind be transferrable on a genetic level? I'm not trying to turn this into a  urlLink Lamarckian  bit of nonsense. There must be a gene that can be turned off to produce an altered brain. Would this possibility undercut&nbsp;some of&nbsp;that talk about moving from forests to savannahs, with the bipedlas being able to see predators more clearly?

I don't know quote what to make of this, as it takes the evolutionism of bipedalism being prompted by behavioral into something more purely genetic.   I think....

						   In pulling a new overstock list, I found a book that i shelved months ago, and forgot was on my To Read list. It's &nbsp; urlLink My Life As An Explorer . After reading Gurdjieff's  urlLink Meetings With Remarkable Men , I had a taste for more of the strangeness and mystery of Central Asia. Poor old Hedin apparently was one of the preeminent European explorers of the area, and wrote many volumes of his treks across these lands, but the jackass foolishly supported the Nazis late in his life. No one much cared for his accomplishments after that.   Still, the book is incredible. I'm only several chapters in, and he has met with&nbsp; Nasser-al-Din, Shah of Iran, and stolen the skulls of three dead  urlLink Zoroastrians . It's not quite as insane as Gurdjieff's tales of walking through a desert on stilts to avoid sandstorms, (with goats on tethers in tow!) but at least I can believe most of Hedin's adventures actually occurred.   Already I have my eye on which might be the best collection of  urlLink Aurel Stein's  writings.

						   I forgot to post this one!  &nbsp;  I read it in a single night nearly a month ago. Apparently that Jonathan Lethem essay on Jack Kirby was only a taster for this full book. It wasn't  really  that much about superheroes though. Quite a few of the essays were on peculiar&nbsp;underground comics (Jim Woodring's  Jim ,) or longtime perennial&nbsp;classics that have transcended genre ( Tin Tin .  Classics Illustrated .) Unfortunately, in the time that has passed, much of the content has already faded from my memory, just the feeling of deep running passion for an underrespected literary genre.   It turns out that  urlLink the Jim Woodring book  Frank   is now unavailable at our bookstore. That book was supposed to be mine, damn it. While i had no money back then, I'm kicking myself for not getting the  Jim  collection that i swear i remember seeing in a Fantagraphics catalogue years go, as it has disappeared even from Amazon.com.   Anyway, the essays of Atomsmashers does not overly intellectualize comics with arch postmodern deconstruction. These are sincere explorations of emotional memory. Highly recommended.

						   In honor of my friend Chris going to&nbsp; urlLink Carcassonne  last weekend, let's revisit our friends  urlLink the Cathars .   They didn't believe in a preisthood, as it was elitist. They believed in a form of reincarnation. Because of their belief in reincarnation, they believed that the soul was genderless, thus both sexes were treated with equal respect. They had a peculiar quirk of believing the material world is evil, created by a malicious god, but unlike certain sects today who believe the world is evil, the Cathars did not want to procreate, brining any other live into this world. There's a certain amount of integrity in that stance, in my opinion. While i don't believe matter is evil, i can see some merit in  urlLink docetism .   It quite amuses me that Cacassone prominently displays the stone that crushed to death that mass murdering fuckhead Crusader Simone de Montfort.

						   It deeply irritates me that Native Americans have been pulling cheap stunts trying to keep anyone from finding out more of the truth. One columnist regarded the refusal to allow the bones of the Kennewick Man akin to creationists denying evolutionists to study fossils. Yes, i know that the Kennewick Man is potentially someone's ancestor, but so what? I understand that there are cultural differences, but if the Native Americans' faith is so damned strong, why are they hellbent on being so evasive? This is about more than repsct for ancestors. In this BBC article, one scientist remarks that the number of the bones in the cabinet have actually mysteriously increased, which raises the question of someone deliberately muddying the evidence trail of who the Kennewick Man was.

						   Whenever Bill gets around to relating his story about the current location of the Ark of the Covenant, this will have more context, but I'm confused by all of these mentions of white powder gold. There's mentions of the terms ORMUS, m-state, and best of all... manna.  &nbsp;  The New Age folks link it to  urlLink Melchizedek  priests, the Egyptians, the Sumerians, and every other advanced priesthood or culture in the Mid or Near East. The history is questionable, but I really would like to know what  urlLink manna  was.&nbsp; It's also nice and convenient to believe that there is a practical application&nbsp;for the&nbsp;mad quest for gold by alchemists through the ages.  &nbsp;   urlLink Dave Hudson  is the current proponent of white powder gold. It's proving very difficult to track down anything more recent on the man than 1998. Since this stuff is supposed to alter consciousness and health, it would be worth noting what has happened to someone who seems to be ingesting this concoction.  &nbsp;  There is a lot of nearly plausible pseudo-science attached to this. I even found a possibly legitimate think tank that dabbles in fringe concepts that was interested in the property of this so-called white powder of gold, but do not want them to notice my silly musings in their referral logs.

						   I've been toying with the idea of re-reading two books, The Arabian Nights and Don Quixote. For the first time&nbsp;in my memory, I'm paying&nbsp;attention to which translation&nbsp;might best suit me this time around. It's Borges' fault, of course. I still have not finished  urlLink Collected Fictions , but he has me thirsting to taste those books again. The first time i read both of those books was in college, and the second time was during one of my periods that I had dropped out, probably during a stint mowing lawns or as a carpenter's helper. I know that the translation of the Arabian Nights that i read was  urlLink the one by Richard Burton , and  think  that the version of Don Quixote I read the second time around was  urlLink the J.M. Cohen one . (I have no idea which version I read in college, but i do remember preferring it.) Between Borges and Potocki, I feel that I need to revisit these books.  &nbsp; It excited me to find out that Borges wrote an essay on the various translations of the Arabian Nights, included in  urlLink Selected Non-Fictions . I snuck into Barnes &amp; Noble on Friday to read a few pages of it. (I plan to buy it as soon as Louise &amp; I get past the latest INS obstacle.) Even though Borges frowns on Burton's vulgar takes on situtations and his inherent racist language, so far it seems that I might actually prefer the Burton version. Reading about the agendas that each successive generation of translators held in rebelling against the previous generation is fascinating though. Both he and A.S. Byatt (who wrote the introduction for the Modern Library's Burton version) recommend  urlLink The Arabian Nights: A Companion , so that's also on my immediate wish list too.  &nbsp; It surprised me to receive the fifteenth issue of  urlLink the Believer  yesterday, to find that it includes an article on the different translations of Don Quixote.  urlLink The new Grossman version  is sitting on the shelf at the bookstore, tempting me every time i am running a register. The Believer article has me deeply curious about  urlLink the Raffel version  too now, although it warns that it can be the most fun in certain passages, it's the one that goes the most off the rails into overly contemporary awkwardness.  &nbsp; Incidentally, I think that the documentary of the failure of Gilliam's Don Quixote film,  urlLink Lost in La Mancha , is possibly a better adaptation of the spirit of the book than any representation of the actual story on film. Although I'm sure that the film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote would have been entertaining, there's no way that Gilliam could have pulled in off better than in his struggle and failure.

						    urlLink    The entrance to the Mamertine prison.  This was the prison where Sts. Peter and Paul were incarcerated under Nero.  It was a tiny, cramped affair and it stank.  The cell was well below ground and, prior to the construction of some stairs centuries later, the only access to the cell was through a small hole in the ground.

						   A pentagram does not have to be pointed downward to be a pentagram.  &nbsp; I'm certain that i read that many of the references to black magick with the downward pointed pentagram is a relatively recent innovation, probably only in the 20th Century. It's probably in that Manly P. Hall book, but that's in Husser right now.&nbsp;  urlLink This&nbsp;site  seems to have a relatively moderate history of the pentagram. Eliphas Levi Zahed (aka Alphonse Louis Constant) is one possible lead on the dark symbology connected to the inverted pentagram.  &nbsp; Freemasonry is also connected with the pentagram, but it's proving difficult to find a good link that demonstrates this without the author attempting to prove that Freemason's are Satanists.

						   I cannot for the life of me find a link to this church on the net.&nbsp; This is what I remember:&nbsp; The church is St. Martinskirche in Hanover, Germany.&nbsp; It is a church that was constructed in the late 1300s.&nbsp; I am unsure about the relative dates of any additions; there was a noticeable difference between the foundation-stones and the&nbsp;exterior walls of the church proper. &nbsp;The first thing that struck me, however, was the large pentagram that adorned one side of the clock tower!  &nbsp;   urlLink    There it is... THE PENTAGRAM. Note also the Star of David behind the clock face on the left side of the tower.  Now, I am definitely not up on my pagan imagery, but I understand that the five pointed star is not a pentagram unless the "tip" is pointing down, thus creating the imagery of the goat (long snout and two horns).  WHOA LOOKATTHAT.  I really wanted to see the interior but the church was closed.  The door was also VERY interesting, though.  Perhaps I'm naieve, but I assume that one would expect... I dunno...  christian  imagery adorning a  christian  church.  What I saw was quite the opposite:    urlLink    A shot of the door to the church.   urlLink    Detail of the lower left of the door: Dogs ripping a dove apart.  Peace prevails!    urlLink    Detail of the lower right of the door: A snake approaching a bird's nest.  Maybe he wants to say "hello".  The depiction of Jesus above the door, while not necessarily weird, was certainly not that of a hale Teutonic Deutsch-Jesus:   urlLink    The waifish and odd-looking Jesus above the door.   If anyone has ANY info about this particular church (yeah right), please comment.

						    urlLink Lost Christianity  by Jacob Needleman served to occupy me on the agonizingly long plane ride to Europe and throughout my stay in Rome. The book is wonderful. When I finished it, I wished that I had read it  before  I devoted years of my young life reading texts on mysticism and "inner Christianity", often without context.&nbsp; The book is accessible, cogent, and even somewhat exiting at parts.&nbsp; Needleman manages to infuse his writing with a sense of intellectual tension, and as a reader, that often translates into something akin to suspense.&nbsp; I'm a little leery of using words like "tension" and "suspense" in this review, because I do not want to mislead someone into thinking that the book is some sort of intellectual adventure story.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; Neither is it a dry, academic affair that reads like a monograph.&nbsp; It manages to strike a readable balance between the two, and this balance makes it the perfect introduction (that I have encountered thus far) to the subject of an inner or esoteric dimension to Christianity.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Needleman, it must be noted, is not a "crackpot".&nbsp; The danger one encounters when reading books of this kind is that, more often than not, some loopy author is trying to prove that this or that heretical sect was the TRUE Christianity and the evil institutional Church violently and mercilessly supressed them for material reasons, thus snuffing out the TRUE Christian message.&nbsp; Many works dealing with Christian mysticism &nbsp;(especially today, given the recent boom in interest about gnosticism due to the&nbsp;popularity of The Da Vinci Code and the works of Elaine Pagels) fall into the "pseudo-scholarship/conspiracy theory" category.&nbsp; It is important, therefore, to recognize a dependable, readable, and balanced introduction to the subject.&nbsp; This, my friends, is it.  &nbsp;  Needleman begins with an overview detailing his entry into the subject (interesting in itself since he is Jewish), then proceeds to profile three Christians whom he sees as living the "Lost Christianity".&nbsp; The first is Metropolitan Anthony Bloom, an Orthodox bishop whose own book  urlLink Beginning to Pray &nbsp;I highly recommend, the others are a Catholic priest named Fr. Vincent and an Orthodox monk named Fr. Sylvan.&nbsp; The latter&nbsp;receives the most attention, as he wrote extensively on inner Christianity in manuscript and posthumously sent these writings to Needleman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Needleman uses these men to elucidate the characteristics of his "lost Christianity".&nbsp; The book continues with a discussion of the "lost doctrine of the soul".&nbsp; Other Christians are profiled, including Thomas Merton and Fr.

						   My trip began in Rome, and as a nominal Catholic I spent the great bulk of my time in and around the Vatican. It was incredible. St. Peter's Basilica, as you may know, is roughly three times taller than the Statue of Liberty. It is the largest church in the world. Click on any of these photos to enlarge them.    urlLink     This is the view from the alleyway next to the apartment in Rome... one can see the Dome of St. Peters in the distance.     urlLink    The courtyard outside of St. Peter's during the Pope's weekly address.    Now, most of the photos I took with my Olympus Camedia 1.3 megapixel no-zoom camera. Thus the suckage. It was simply not versatile enough to do much in the basilica's immense interior. That did not, unfortunately, prevent me from trying.   urlLink    A crooked ass shot of Bernini's famous altar piece.  Looking at these shots, I see that they cannot convey the IMMENSITY of this place.  It was huge.  I experienced sensory overload... I couldn't keep gasping "ooh ahh" at every square inch of the place, so I was forced to accept it.     urlLink    A shot of the Dome from the ground level...its height is deceptive since everything was built to scale...   urlLink    A random shot of the interior.   urlLink    A little bit of the old sculpture...  For the hale pilgrim, there is an option to climb to the top of the dome.  An elevator takes you halfway up, where you can then go out onto the cupola and look down.     urlLink    A beautiful shot of a mass from the cupola of the dome.  The letters you see across the top were six and a half feet tall...  You take stairs the rest of the way up... 367 of them.  They get so narrow and steep that you pull yourself the last few yards by rope.  The resulting view is worth it, though.   urlLink    A shot of the square from the tip-top of the dome.  Note the Egyptian obliesk.  More to come...

						    urlLink    Front and center: The Jewish Vegan Dancer Chick  I posted a few sentences from Zurich a few days back, but I was "on the clock" and did not get a chance to elaborate.  One of the reasons I enjoyed the trip so much was because a LOT of interesting things happened to me.    After the debacle during the day (see previous Zurich posts for all the whining) my hostel roomates and I decided to go out for a beer.  We ended up about two block from the main train station at a bar whose name escapes me.  We sat outside so we could watch people walk by.  After the first beer, a young lady heard us talking and approached the table.  "Are you guys American?".    She was a med-student living in Israel (Tel-Aviv) on her way to Baltimore, Md for a summer internship at Johns Hopkins.  Her plane had been laid over so she had decided to take the train into Zurich to see what she could see.  She came off as ditzy at first, but as the conversation continued she revealed herself to be quite bright.  The conversation itself ranged from the Holocaust and the nature of authority (of course) to Jewish mysticism.  She mentioned that she had been a history major in her undergrad years, with a concentration in Medieval Judaism.  I brought up Gershom Scholem.  She said that she thought "he was the man".    John (on the right in the picture) mentioned that he had been living in Poland for the past two months.  Jordania (her name) said that she had been to Poland only once, and that was in connection to the Holocaust.  She said that Israeli youth spent two weeks in remembrance and celebration.  The first week consisted of tours of concentration camps in Poland and Germany.  The second week was spent "partying and basically having a lot of sex."  Wow.    Later she mentioned that she was a vegan.  I asked if it was a philosophical thing.  "Spiritual," she said.  "I believe that eating meat is eating a soul.  It's sort of like karma."    I wonder how many Israeli Jews back her up on that one.  She was a very interesting girl indeed.  She had an odd sense of humor that I liked.  Downsides included the fact that she was a modern dancer (ugh) and the fact that she was from originally from Texas (ugh).    When viewing the picture, keep in mind that I am not a giant. She was only about 4'11".

						   Okay okay okay... I got the word secondhand from a friend who saw it on "I Love the 90s".&nbsp; Apparently the Alanis Morissette song "You Oughta Know" is about Dave Coulier.&nbsp; That's right.. Uncle Joey from "Full House".&nbsp; The link above takes you to snopes, the Urban Legend busters.&nbsp; The site lists the status of the rumor as "undetermined", but supposedly the news was all over the airwaves yesterday (I don't watch much TV so I cannot verify). &nbsp; IF this is true, I have two questions. &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; UNCLE FUCKING JOEY!?!?!?!?!?!&nbsp; Dave Coulier, the lovable goofball who nauseated me every afternoon with his Bullwinkle impressions (ugh) and his wholsome humor (mygod) is apparently a BORDERLINE PEDOPHILE.&nbsp; Alanis, bless her heart, was nineteen when big Uncle J dogged her out.&nbsp; Assuming that the song's lyrics are accurate reflections of what went on between them,&nbsp; we learn disturbing things about Coulier's sexual proclivities.&nbsp; To be precise: Uncle Joey was fellated in a movie theater by a girl who was fifteen years his junior.&nbsp; "Cut it out".&nbsp; This brings up a second question: &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Who the hell cast "Full House"?!?!?!&nbsp; This show was a sappy family affair that featured "ouch"-inducing jokes and "cute warfare".&nbsp; It always ended with some sort of life lesson and a big hug.&nbsp; So when the producers were sitting around preparing to launch, I want to know who the hell suggested Bob Sagat, a pervert who has made many references to masturbating in his trailer during shoots and "banging" Kimmy numerous times, for the lead role?&nbsp; And not only Sagat, but Mr. Dave&nbsp;"I Was Fellated By A Little Girl in a Movie Theater" Coulier.&nbsp; Irony has never been so.... ironic? &nbsp; Note: the above was designed to be hyperbolic for comedic purposes.&nbsp; On the off chance that Mr. Coulier reads this entry (he has nothing better to do):&nbsp; "Go get em Dave!

						   I read Italo Calvino's  Invisible Cities  in Venice.&nbsp; The book is short and the concept is rather abstract, so the environment I found myself in lent itself quite well to Calvino's flights of fancy.&nbsp; Brett posted a&nbsp; link to an essay some time ago that discussed at length the artistry of Calvino and Borges.&nbsp; I read that essay eagerly and wholeheartedly agree with the author's glowing praise of the two authors.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have heard Calvino referred to as "the poor man's Borges".&nbsp; I think it was Anthony Burgess who called him "Borges on a bad day".&nbsp; I find these comparisons rather harsh.&nbsp; Calvino and Borges, while both writing fiction that deals with the fantastic and the abstract, have totally different styles.&nbsp; Borges was more of a minimalist than  urlLink Ray Carver &nbsp;and his stories dealt with concepts like time, eternity, and myth from the perspective of the interested but aloof observer.&nbsp; Calvino's fictions are full of whimsy and wonder.&nbsp; They have the feel of fairy tales where Borges' stories read like&nbsp;wonderfully erudite newspaper articles.&nbsp; Perhaps that is going too far, but to suggest that&nbsp;Calvino was the lesser writer because he was unable to grapple with the "Big Questions" as authoritatively as Borges did is nonsense.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Before I&nbsp;get to the actual review, I would like&nbsp;state that Borges is certainly&nbsp;my favorite of the&nbsp;two, but this is not due to any percieved superiority of craft.&nbsp; With MiloradPavic, I &nbsp;assert that Borges was the best reader of the last hundred years.&nbsp; A reader who happened to have the ability to succinctly and capably share his interests, much to the benefit of all readers.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Invisible Cities  is a book with only two characters.&nbsp; Well, three.&nbsp; The bulk of the text sees Marco Polo recounting his travels to various fantastic cities to the emperor Kublai Khan.&nbsp; The emperor eagerly listens to the foreigner describe cities that are by turns appalling, wonderful, unbelieveable, and tragic.&nbsp; As the book progresses, it becomes clear that Polo is in reality describing only one place.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The chapters are all quite short, and each chapter consists of Polo's recollection of a single city.&nbsp; These recollections in turn fall under one of several headings, including "Cities and Memory", Cities and Desire", "Cities and Signs", "Thin Cities", "Trading Cities", "Cities and Death", "Cities and Eyes", Cities and Names", "Cities and the sky", etc. etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these headings are repeated throughout the book, with each city described shedding new light on the theme.&nbsp; Interspersed throughout are the thoughts of the Emperor, who is presiding over a dying Empire.&nbsp; He debates whether Polo is humoring him with these fantastic tales or if the foreigner wishes to illustrate something more meaningful with his memories.&nbsp; The reader, however, soon learns that Polo (Calvino) is trying to tell us all something.&nbsp; The Khan's empire is our planet, and both appear to be dying out.&nbsp; &nbsp; The final passage is key:  And Polo said: "The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.&nbsp; There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.&nbsp; The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space." &nbsp;   A

						   Sorry for the scattershot nature of the recent updates...  I return to the US tomorrow.  Expect plenty of pictures and narrative accounts of my adventures (and there were many).   Brett:  I need you to look up some symbols in the Manly Hall.  Remind me to ask you about them.    Today I visited the art museum in Frankfurt.  I saw lots of famous paintings... some Bosch, Kircher, Van Gogh, Renoir, Manet, Monet, Rembrandt, etc. etc.  Bosch would definitely be my favorite artist.  His vision was well before his time.  In a later post I'll discuss him at length- including the theories that his works held hidden meaning for masons, alchemists, or heretics (depending on the particular theory in question).    One oddity caught my eye immediately, however.  In a work by Joos van der Beke van Cleve, a triptych painting depicting the crucifixion and some saints and martyrs, there were two weird symbols in the upper corners where there would normally be angels in an attitude of prayer.  Both looked masonic to me, but since I'm quite ignorant of masonic symbology, I could very well be wrong.  No matter WHAT they were, they were definitely out of place in this particular painting.  I'll have a full report in a day or so....  Wish me luck on the flight back.

						   It is official:  I have now been cold-shouldered on TWO continents.  Zurich is the most beautiful city I have visited thus far, but my own tendency to self-distruct has kicked in yet again.  My friend here in Switzerland seemed cold and distant today.  at first I thought that I was overreacting, but as the night wore on it became more and more clear that I was excess baggage.    As the Swiss say:  Schiess.  In other news, Greece won the European Soccer champion tonight (it is midnight here in Zurich).  There were some crazy Greek fans behind me and they chanted THE WHOLE NINETY MINUTES.  It was great though...   More later, and my pictures are top-notch.

						   So Bill peered through their keyhole, into their sovereign domain!   Even though our beloved Jan Potocki was a Knight of Malta, i have no love for this organization. They are the anti-Freemasons, the dark archconservative aristocrats, orchestrating the oppression of Latin American and Africa. They have ties to the intelligence community (primarily the CIA it seems) and the Bilderbergers.   Contemporary members (most of which i lifted from  urlLink RAW site ):   urlLink Franz von Papen . who persuaded von Hinderburg to resign and make Hitler the Chancellor of Germany.  General  urlLink Rheinhard Gehlen .

CIA director during the Iran-Contra conspiracy. 1981 to 1987.     urlLink Otto von Habsburg . also a member of the Bilderbergers and part of the Merovingian bloodline according to Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh (ha ha. Yeah, i trust  those  guys implicitly...)     urlLink Licio Gelli ,  urlLink Roberto Calvi  and Michele Sindona, leaders of the  urlLink P2 Conspiracy  in Italy in the 1970s-80s. I have lots of doubts about the Wikipedia's assertions that the P2 Conspiracy had anything to do with true Freemasonry or with the Red Brigade (other than with the Red Brigade a pawns,) as both are ideologically opposed to right wing causes.  urlLink Silvio Berlusconi  was in on this too, and i'd wager he's a Knight of Malta too. I'm also curious about the slightly unusual footnote of the  urlLink House of Savoy  now being allowed back onto Italian soil now that Berlusconi is in control.   Clare Booth Luce. of the *Time* magazine empire became a "Dame  of  Malta." (Clare Booth Luce was on the board of the Rev. Sun-Moon's Washington Times newspaper.)  John McCone. Former CIA Director. 1961 to 1965.    urlLink James Jesus Angelton . deputy director of counter-intelligence of CIA until fired in 1975 by  urlLink William Colby .    urlLink Allen Dulles . Former CIA Director. 1953 to 1961.    urlLink Augusto Pinochet . Mass murdering fuckhead.    urlLink For more Knights of Malta fun.....

						    Are you sure there is such a thing as true chaos other than an abstract concept?   Well, there is a dictionary definition, but in the grand perspective, all things could fall under the heading "Abstract concepts" Certainly God concepts often do. My point is, Chaos, as a starting place, is, to me, far more conducive to various possibilities than creation. From chaos, order can happen & at a large enough scale that a universal law can apply with in it’s brackets. But beyond that, beyond what we currently know, lies a void that I’m not comfortable filling up with human virtues dressed up as deity.       Another abstract concept would be non-being, nonexistence, which we cannot directly experience. Can we even envision what real chaos is?        You &amp; I can to an extent, Just as we can & we can't, the infinite.The goal shouldn’t be to set easy boundaries & concepts when trying to take on the unraveling of origins &amp; outcome. We should be fueled by the "un know" to grow & learn. To rise up to meet what may be, rather than shrink it down to our common ability to understand.      If order is merely a bubble in a maelstrom, why would god not be defined as that bubble that has not collapsed into unreality?     Yes, why shouldn’t it? Some do define god as that. I’ve been watching the God concepts dismantle &amp; collapse on themselves in my one short life span. But again, we can still entertain there being a God with the void, or chasm of chaos, being the origin. If nothing else, Gods came into being in the universe of the human mind. But so did the hot dog & I’m not sure either one is a sufficient explanation to the beginning of all things.      The raindrop theory does little to undermine that. So far, the universe that we inhabit has irrational elements that are still and may always be beyond human comprehension, but it's governed by recognizable, even if currently inexplicable, patterns.    Again, to note a pattern in something falls short of determining what governs it. And if something is admittedly beyond human comprehension, then what human is of the authority to state what governs it?    God could very well be defined as the underlying principles of mathematics and physics.    Do it &amp; then see if you can do the same thing for the hot dog. In a world of uncertainty & bewilderment, many things can be proposed &amp; argued. But here is my point. Uncertainty & Bewilderment is a definition of confusion. Confusion &amp; disorder is the definition of chaos. The ORIGIN Greek khaos 'vast chasm, void'. Khaos was believed to be the state of things pre-"creation" of the universe. So the concept still allowed for creation, but not creation as all encompassing, nor origin to all things.   That is that I don't believe that the universe is in a swirling malestrom of chaos. (And i believe that infinite realities occur simultaneously, in ever branching fully realized fragments. So what?) True chaos, ungoverned by mathematical expression, has not been proven to exist. The existence of true chaos is a matter of faith.   Faith is also believing that infinite realities occur simultaneously, in ever branching fully realized fragments. But, faith can be a useful tool in the void. Also, if you believe in infinite realities occurring, then to cover all aspects of the infinite, then even to you, true chaos must exist, or else it falls short of "infinite". But, are you sure that the infinite really exists? Or is it just an abstract concept?

						     urlLink Now, can order & synchronization exist if it's just a part of Chaos &amp; Random? YES!!    Are you sure there is such a thing as true chaos other than an abstract concept? Another abstract concept would be non-being, nonexistence, which we cannot directly experience. Can we even envision what real chaos is? If order is merely a bubble in a maelstrom, why would god not be defined as that bubble that has not collapsed into unreality? The raindrop theory does little to undermine that. So far, the universe that we inhabit has  irrational elements that are still and may always be beyond human comprehension, but it's governed by recognizable, even if currently inexplicable, patterns.

						   I sat & watched as the drips of water dripped off the edge off the over hang. I listened to the random rhythm of the drops as they fell to the ground. Then I took notice of something. Some of the drips were synchronized!! Then I thought, what are the chances of that? One hundred &amp; thirty seven million rain drops, hitting this over hang, all at random, then forming random streams that flow to the end of the over hang & drip random drops. Yet! There is synchronization!! Order! A pattern!! IT'S A MIRACLE!! YES!!!  No! ...It's mathematical. They are not synchronized because they are being controlled by order, they are synchronized because there are only so many seconds in a minute &amp; in that one minute, 180,666 drops must fall on that one little over hang. Mathematically, synchronization must happen. It would be more of a miracle if no two drops happened at the same time.  Look at yourselves as raindrops. If a million of you pray that your best friend gets well and he does, you think, "THAT IS ALL THE PROOF I NEED! THERE IS A GOD! THAT'S THE PROOF!" But, when you consider the fact that a million people are praying over the same situations, a sick friend, it would be more amazing if EVERYONE that was being prayed for DIED! Now, when you point out to the person of faith, incidents where the person being prayed for does die, Then the person of FAITH say's, "It must have been God's will." Well, here is a question. If there is a GOD, Isn't everything his will? Can his will be changed by mere mortals? Aren't prayers futile? It makes no since. I would like to see at least ONE person of riligious faith state. "I believe in GOD, but I don't believe because it's the logical thing. I just believe & that's all there is to it. I will not enter in to an argument of reason &amp; logic with this belief, because, it does not fare very well in such an exchange."  You see, the Gods cannot live in the confines of the RATIONAL mind. That's why it depends on FAITH. If God could be proven by science, then FAITH is worthless. Once you accept that your belief is fueled by FAITH ALONE!!! Not human logic!!! Then you can start trying to understand what the make up of Faith is.  This is why the atheistic view will always win the rational, logical, conscious perception debate. It runs parallel to the age old Chaos V.S. .Order debates. CHAOS (Atheist) vs ORDER (Religious) Chaos (NO GOD) allows the possible existence of order & synchronization, but recognizes it as just a small fiber of Chaos &amp; Random. An anomaly if you will. Order (GOD belief) does not allow chaos & random as a possibility. For chaos &amp; random just appears to be chaos & random, but only if you take them out of the context of order as it’s all encompassing origin. Chaos &amp; Random, through this perspective, are believed to be just a part of ORDER . You see? This is the proposed argument! If Order (GOD) is the origin of "what is", then chaos & and random are actually planned and are, there for, just tools of order &amp; synchronization. They are not what they appear to be! They are not, in fact, chaos or random! So there is NO chaos! & there is NO random! There is only order! &amp; that suggests a divine plan, an architect to all that is around us! A God perhaps!  That was a nice perspective but let’s get real! Check this out! If Chaos & Random (NO GOD) is our origins, then that opens the door to ALL possibilities, including, the occurrence of Order &amp; the occurrence of Synchronization. Now, can order & synchronization exist if it's just a part of Chaos &amp; Random? YES!! Now, Can Random & Chaos exist if it's really just a part of order &amp; Synchronization? The answer is ....NO! Because you can't be outside of order & synchronization (GOD)! If that is the all encompassing cause. But, you can be anything if the all encompassing cause is chaos &amp; random. Since we have no proof of origin, then it makes more since to embrace a philosophy that is open to ALL possibilities, as opposed to embracing a philosophy that closes off valid possibilities! ............................................!!!!

There should be no negative connotation associated with rational and irrational.

Fantastic overview of the man and his work, written in anticipation of the recentEnglish language reissues that Bill & i are reading.   urlLink Fantastic Zoology: a graphical interpretation of Borges' "Book of Imaginary Beings"  I'm not keen on some of the artwork, but it's certainlyambitious.   urlLink The Intruder: A Borges story in eight games.  This doesn't capture the nature of his work, but it's one of the odder tributes to an author i've seen, outside of Dr. Seuss.   urlLink The Book of Sand  A peculiar game that i'm too impatient to play.  To round things off, here's some possibly relevant Borges quotes to what Damien & Bill have been posting:  "To die for a religion is easier than to live it absolutely."  "To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible god."

						   So as I'm typing at the old computer, wondering at the magic that is the inter-web, I heard one of those music commercial advertising the latest in a long line of classical music compilations.  How do you catch the attention of your potential audience?  Try naming the album "The Most Relaxing Classical Album in the World....Ever."   That's the name of the album.  I couldn't believe it.  I though tit was a joke.... not so.   Brilliant marketing.

						   This is my second attempt at this post.  I spent a good hour and a half writing a nuanced, lucid, and frank post full of references to literature, scholarship, and Damien Youth songs.  I finished, hit the "publish post" button, and sat back and watched as NOTHING HAPPENED.  Attention internet:  you have wasted yet another two hours of my time.    Here goes attempt #2:   I am currently reading six books.  I'm in a kind of limbo, waiting for two or three to grab my attention and move to the forefront... One of the main contenders is Aldous Huxley's  urlLink The Perennial Philosophy .  Huxley is of course quite well known for his "Brave New World", a book that I think is slightly overrated.  Huxley apparently became very interested in religion towards the end of his career.    The basic premise of the book is that all religions are fundamentally the same in their mystical aspects.  This is an argument that is by no means new... the phrase "The Perennial Philosophy" was coined by Leibnitz and such academic luminaries as Fritjof Schuon and Huston Smith promote the idea.  Since I have not finished the book, I will NOT do a review.  I thought that some of the ideas that I've come across in it thus far would provoke some interesting discussion.    -My first thought has to do with the title.  Can "religion", properly understood, be considered a "philosophy".  Philosophy, in its classical form, can be defined simply as the intellectual pursuit to understand the nature of all things.  "Things" is, to me, the key concept.  Philosophy focuses with "the world" or "nature".  Religion, at least as I understand it, most certainly does not.  This may or may not be a small matter, but I think it deserves some thought.  Mr. Damien Youth, in his song "Mythical Light" has a man (portrayed in the song as a rather shallow "believer type") say in reference to Christianity: "I embrace this philosophy".  My question is this:  Is it a mistake to think about religion, to "deal with it", as one would a philosophy?   -Huxley devotes a great deal of time to the discussion of the unity of the mystical experience.  This experience, which consists of "ego death" and some sort of unitive experience (be it unity with God, the Void, Divine Light, or whatever)is attested to in Buddhism, Christianity, Sufism, Hinduism, and even mystical Judaism.  It is also referenced (maybe) in the above mentioned song.  The chorus runs in part: "My spirit... floating skinless in mythical/mystical light".  Thought?  Extrapolations?
