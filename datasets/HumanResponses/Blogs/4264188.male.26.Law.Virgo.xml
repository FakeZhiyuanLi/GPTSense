       Trusting the national security of the United States to the Democratic Party and its operatives is like giving whiskey and the car keys to a teenage boy - P.J. O’Rourke    And with those two lines I could retire for the day and you would have every reason you need to Never vote for a Democrat. It’s why I loathe all things democrat, liberal and left. And it’s the message Every Person needs to understand by the time November rolls around. It is Crucial to your safety and mine that the Mutt from Massachusetts not be permitted to Lie, Cheat and Whore his way into the White House.   The Mutt continued to baffle the public yesterday regarding his every-evolving national security plan. He previously promised to pull troops from Iraq as soon as he’s elected. It was a good sound bite, but that’s all it was.  Kerry speaks in broad theories, offering as little specifics as possible. It’s a clever trick, but the Gig is Up. Tune in the next time his gruesome mug pollutes the national airwaves and listen to what he’s actually saying.  Speaking to the VFW yesterday the Mutt criticized Bush for calling home thousands of troops positioned around the world. Huh? So he wants to call home troops from where they are needed but leave them where they are not. Yes. That makes as much sense as feeding bird seed to a rhino.  The Mutt criticized Bush saying the deployment “needs to be done at the right time and in a sensible way.” That’s it, folks. That is the full extent of his plan. Act at the Right Time. Act Sensibly. Thanks, jackass.   And this is just another example of Kerry being Kerry. Broad idea – no details. He brings nothing to the table but dim-witted criticism of everything Bush does. He is Reactive, not Proactive … and that’s a perilous trait for one who aspires to be president.   When is the Right Time? When would it be Sensible? Kerry’s not sure. All he knows is that Bush wants to do it now, so there’s no chance in hell that time could be now. His need to squabble over every decision Bush makes gives us a preview of what a Kerry presidency would be like: no compromises on anything. It’ll be his way, or the highway. Chew on that for a minute, Bubba. You think they don’t get anything done in DC now? Watch the government come to grinding halt as the Mutt’s Men descend on the Hill.   At the same VFW meeting, Kerry further solidified his reputation as a flip-flopping Hack by renewing his call to add 40,000 troops – in places other than Iraq. Yes, good plan. Those on the ground in Iraq don’t need relief. Indeed. Let’s send troops to Australia, or perhaps Belize.   And, once again, Kerry offered no details. No mention of where the 40,000 would come from, or where to deploy them. Bush wants to bring the boys back Home, so we can assume Kerry’s automatically against that. Perhaps the Mutt offers no details because he has no clue. Perhaps the extra 40,000 troops exist in the same La-La Land as the money Kerry plans to spend on his various campaign promises, without raising taxes.   The Mutt’s calls for the withdrawal of some troops, and the deployment of others, to places he’s keeping secret clearly establish the one constant in his campaign: he has no idea what he’s doing. And that scares the hell out of me, friend. And it should scare the hell out of you, too.   The only issue that matters in this election year is the defense of our Nation and, by God, our way of life. Nothing Else Matters. Can you vote for someone who could very well get you killed?   Think of it this way: if you were a terrorist, who would you vote for? Someone pledged wiping your miserable kind from the face of the earth, or someone with a consistent record of voting against every military funding bill presented on the floor of the Senate?   The terrorists are lining up in droves to vote for Kerry. You can vote with the terrorists or against them. It’s that simple, Bubba.

We ain’t nothing but liberals … well, some of us criminals Who cut tax breaks for the rich like cantaloupes {slurp} But if I can parasail like a blue-blood misanthrope I see no reason why a man and another man can’t elope {ewww!} And if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Feminists wave your pantyhose, impeach Tex, and away we go  I’m John Kerry, botox made me less scary The many faces of Kerry as real as the tooth fairy So won’t the real Kerry please stand up, Please stand up, please stand up?  George Bush don’t gotta waffle on issues to sway voters Well I do, so f#ck him and f#ck you too! You think I give a damn about tha south, g? Half of you hicks can’t even stomach me, let alone understand me ”But John, what if you won, wouldn’t it be weird?” Why? So what if my guys lie to get me here? You can inaugurate me here to the public’s jeers Shit, Ruth Bader Ginsburg better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Daschle ‘n’ the rest of the worst And hear ’em argue over who I should screw over first. GOP put me on blast on Fox News TV: ”Yeah, he lies, and his wife looks like a manatee, hee-hee” I should download my audio on mp3 And show the whole world I’m New England aristocracy (ahhh!) I’m sick of you little pro-life ‘n’ rich groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you {bzzzt} And there’s a million Democrats just like me Who waffle like me; who just don’t give a f#ck like me Who condescend like me; moan, groan and bitch like me And just might be the next best thing but not as liberal as me!  I’m John Kerry, botox made me less scary The many faces of Kerry as real as the tooth fairy So won’t the real Kerry please stand up, Please stand up, please stand up?  I’m like a nightmare to listen to, cause I’m only givin’ you Things you wanna hear to get you to the voting room The only difference is I got the gall to say it To lie to y’all, don’t care if it’s false and won’t sugarcoated at all I just hop on my yacht and spit it And whether I like to admit it {*err*} I invent it Better than ninety percent of you liars out can Then you wonder how can voters eat up these flip-flops like push-pops It’s funny; cause with all my lies and issue skirting I’ll be the only person in the white house flirting Kickin’ Republican ass, tweakin’ my nipples with jergens And I’m smirkin’ – my whole bag of viagra’s finally working And every single jackass is a John Kerry lurkin’ He could be workin’ at burger king, spittin’ on your onion rings (*hach*} Or in the parkin’ lot, circling Screaming “Bush don’t give a fuck!” With his welfare check and his paranoia up So, will the real John Kerry please stand up? And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And I’m proud to be outta my mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?  I’m John Kerry, botox made me less scary The many faces of Kerry as real as the tooth fairy So won’t the real Kerry please stand up, Please stand up, please stand up?  I’m John Kerry, botox made me less scary The many faces of Kerry as real as the tooth fairy So won’t the real Kerry please stand up, Please stand up, please stand up?

      Well, well ... who taught this dim-witted fool to blog? Aren't their laws designed to prevent people like Him from mass communicating? Ha, ha - no. And that's enough out of you. Silence, they say, is golden - but I've never put much faith in anything They have to say. Welcome to Carnival of Conservatives, the Jungle of Justice ... whatever. This is my space to bark and howl, and if you need another excuse to waste time at work or at home, well, here it is. We'll mainly be talking politics here, although I reserve the right to scribble out a screed on any other topic or person who draws my ire. As the good Doc once said: "Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride." Indeed. Buckle up.
