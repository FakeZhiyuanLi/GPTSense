      Just what every Blog needs to start off with, a rhetorical question.  I don't know what's doing it tonight, at all. It's not like I'm really limited in things I can do, and it's not like there's nothing to do. I already did my homework, English Homework, and that was easy, so I can't do that. Nor can I study for the Math Test tomorrow because there's no point, and I'll do well just the same. And I can't kill people in Vice City... There's only so much running people over you can take before you desire more elaborate deaths.  So I'm posting one of these. I probably should leave this to boredom or anything, I should update frequently. But I'm not even sure how many read this... So maybe I'll put it up on my MSN name. Yeah, that's a good idea, I'll get people to go to my site. I have enough people on my list already. All I need is more stuff on my site. Like Kurt's site. Everyone goes to Kurt's site. That's probably because he shills it harder than a CBS Football announcer trying to get people to watch the next episode of "Judging Amy". I don't blame him though, I with I was so desperate, ya know?  I stayed after school to work on my Tech Ed. project, well, my group's Tech Ed. Project. Not my way I want to spend my Thursdays, in the school for one more hour. But Thornley is all "It's due by the end of the month", the gold toothed pr- um, teacher. Ian is all stubborn about it too, ya know? He won't let me not go. It ended up turning out better than I thought it could've. Anything that involves me dancing ridiculously then getting attacked by two team members on camera is great. You'll see that when the video is unveiled.  And another thing. Message me your website links so I can put them on my site on the yet-to-be-made-links-page-due-to-lack-of-links.  I can't talk much longer, I have to update my site and other boredom killing things.  So yeah.

      Hello everyone out there across the internet, or just people who know about this Blog. The site is getting updated every now and then, so check it out, the link's in the profile, which I just did up.  One more week of school completed as we march on to our final goal: Closing Ceremonies. It's still a ways from now, but it's not like we're doing much in school these days anyway. This is the dead part of the year, where teachers scramble to start new things that will help prepare you for the next year. But the work is so elementary and simple, I could sleep and do it. Of course, there's the occasional test, but after 4 exams, it hardly seems worth it.  Long weekend is here, and that should help me relax a bit, because I do so, SO much. Sarcasm, of course. I'm mostly looking forward to SLEEPING, because it's something I don't get to do much of during the week. Kinda sad when you're most looking forward to sleeping, eh? Well, Ian's at his dad's, which means I can't do anything with him, so I'll probably just hang out with Ben... But you can save me!Yes, you, the one who is reading this Blog RIGHT NOW! YOU can try and make plans with me today! All you have to do is talk to me over MSN and plan something! How astonishing!  And how much do you wanna bet that's not gonna work. Heh, that's life for ya.  Monday shouldn't be too bad, with EHW and all. That'll take up the afternoon, and all. Plus it's Victoria Day... That reminds me...  WHY DO WE CELEBRATE A DAY ABOUT A FAT UGLY OLD QUEEN THAT DIED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO?!?!?!?  Like, yeegads, no one cared about her then, and no one does now. I'm not complaining about the day off, but wouldn't it be better served as like, Bacon Appreciation Day? Or, Drink Pepsi Until You Can't Move Anymore Day?  And, on that note, I'm going now. Check the site and this often, I'll try to keep everyone abreast of the updates, OK?  Tee hee hee, I said "breast".

      OK, that title is a slight misnomer, as this is not my first ever Blog post ever. However, it is my first post on  here , so at least I'm kinda right.  I figured I'd do up a brand new Blog because I just made a new website today, and I figured I should do it properly. For my first site, I'd have this sort of thing, then called "Da Newz!", to talk about what happened that day, what I think of this, what I think of that, blah blah blah. A lot of people liked it... If, by a lot of people, you think "three people", then you're right. One problem: No Archives. It would only go about 10 posts, then I'd have to delete the last one or two to get this one to fit, which sucked. So I found Blog and I've used it ever since, really. But this time, instead of just having a website, or just having a Blog, I'm having a website AND a Blog, which is the smartest thing I could've and should've done.  So I just got back from Quebec last Friday, and MAN was that a crazy trip. I had so much fun, everything was just awesome. The bus rides weren't bad, since it was mostly 20 hours just sitting around, hanging out with your friends while watching movies like "Grease" and "Spice World", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The actual trip, going places and doing things was just nuts, because most of the time we just messed around. Overall, I had a blast and I'm pretty sure everyone else did, for the most part.  Today was a good day of school, because there was barely any work involved. Health class is funny because we only talk about love, puberty and vaginas, which aren't as closely linked as you'd think. English class is mostly us reading "Twelve Angry Men", which I liked, because I played Three. He's an angry child abuser and he gets lots of lines, so that keeps me interested and entertained. Briand is blah, but with 10 less people, it wasn't so bad. Art class is Art class, and that's always like free period, so that's good. And Collins is the usual 3/4 work, 1/4 anything else, which is really true.  I hope to update this often, so check back and keep checking out the site:  urlLink Matt's Website , and I'll see ya later!  -MattV1uh

      ...But then she makes a website like she did, and I muuuust comment on the sheer idiocy. OK, last time I did this, I had just read  Alex's Blog  and almost died of uninteresting  drivel . It was Briand category boring! But I've already killed that  Blog  enough, now I've come to tell you about the horrors of a website she's made that I am confused  about ... (all the boldness is to spoof Alex's use of bolds in said  Blog ) I'll give you the address at the end of this paragraph, because if I were to give it before this, you may look at it and like, I dunno, get an aneurysm from the sheer idiocy. Wait, I used that phrase already. Who cares, it still works, and it's necessary.  The site is about- Well, actually, I don't know, because it doesn't make any sense really. It's basically just pictures taken from a digital camera at Alex's house and trying to piece together a little story, a little retarded story, about.. BusyWorld? Some hobo named Steve? And really, a lot more obscenities than was needed to complete such a website. It's like they took a story, smoked a blunt, tried to write it again, then threw in some random swearing and... porn movies? I don't even know, I just don't. So, you've been warned, and I have to fulfill my promise...   urlLink Alex's site   I'm sorry to do that, but I had to. Oh, I also hope you enjoyed last update, because Alex just read it and I got blocked. It was worth it though, believe me... It was worth it. I'm gonna head out now, so be sure to check back here often.  Until next time, DRINK PEPSI.

       INTRO   Someone may very well ask, "Hey Vaughan, why are you doing up a Blog after such a long abscence?" There's a very easy explanation: Because Alex started a Blog, and after reading it, it sucked. She describes like, every dying moment in her (uninteresting) life, and it hurts to read it, it really does. I don't care what time you woke up this morning, or that you like Junior Mints, or you like to listen to pedophiles sing, tell me something funny. Tell me something about how much you hate your friends. Tell me about how angry your parents make you, and use ridiculous expressions in the process.  Oh wait.  That's how I do Blogs.   Let's get on it...   Yeah, I like to bold font, shut up. I don't even recall where I was last time I did this, so I'll just talk about recently. The grad was pretty cool, I was glad people weren't all like "Hey, let's verbally assault the naive private school girl." However, they did have a nice go of, "Hey Matt, that your girlfriend?" Yes, I managed to get a girlfriend after repeated failed attempts. NOT. No, she's not, and never has been my girlfriend, nor do I hold any desire for such a thing. She's just a friend, so yeah. Boston Pizza was nice. Our waitress looked like a dark haired Jessica Simpson. I think Jessica Simpson is hot. See what I'm getting at?  You don't... I think our waitress at Boston Pizza was hot.  Ya dolt.  After the grad, we go to Geoff's party, which was nice. Teri made a big deal to Brian about how he mentioned Geoff's party in class. Well, mentioned is not the word, I think "talked about at the top of his voice" is a better phrase to use. But anyway, Teri made a big deal over how Brian talked about the party, then said afterwards that certain people weren't invited. She was all, "That made Freddy feel bad." It's not like he looked at Freddy and said "You aren't invited to the party. No one wants you there." He just said that in a general sense. I didn't even think about Freddy in relation to what he said, I don't know why Teri made such a deal out of it. That's Teri for you.  Closing ceremonies were fine, I won 4 academic award-type thingies, so I felt good about that. Report card was nice too. So I'm glad school is over, time to relax, rejoice, and drink Pepsi. That reminds me.  I have a wicked idea for Pepsi T-shirt. OK, imagine a blue t-shirt...  FRONT: Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants... BACK: ...There was nothing I could do. *Pepsi logo underneath text*  Nothing original, but it got me thinking, why not have that back of that shirt (minus the logo) on other t-shirts? F: Your girlfriend gave me herpes... B: ...There was nothing I could do. F: When your baby cried, I shook it... B: ...There was nothing I could do. F: I accidentally shot your dog.... B: ...There was nothing I could do. I realise those are offensive, but c'mon, you'd buy one.  I'll go now, because I'm just awesome that way.  an d   r any  i claims  n of k   p subliminal  e advertising  p are  s completely  i false.

      Well, it took me long enough, eh? Jeez, When was the last time I did this? Don't ask me, it should be right below this update... Or not.  It's June! Yes, that's right, that beautiful month that always seems to drag at times. All the teachers are using the cheapest method ever to make us stay in school for as long as necessary, using tests and projects. Cheap jerks. But I'll probably stay for a while anyway, because, let's face it; I'm me. But it's usually fun in school to have classes with like, 10 other people, and that's it. Teachers are more lenient and all that, and it can be fun to go to school.  Did I just SAY that? Ugh, I knew school got to me. You go to it enough and it drives you nuts. But I digress.  Is it just me or does May always seem to breeze by? I never have the chance to just savor it, things are always happening during it. Like, this May, I suppose it was Quebec for me, as during then it wasn't "Oh, it's May 11th", it was "Oh, we're in Quebec". I don't know if it's like that for anyone else, but OK.  Shilling my site via MSN name is the easiest thing to do ever. Everyone was all up on me, trying to get me to send the site to them, I ended up with a ton of people. Then it was a problem too, because everyone wanted a shout out, and I only gave them to people I like, thought would see the site or want one. So now I have to update with like, ten shout outs, and I have no idea what to say. So bare with me for updates like that.  Well, I have to go kill hookers now (that is to say, play Vice City), so I'll catch ya on the phlip side.

      *sighs deeply* Yes, you read that correctly. I do feel like a big jerk, as a cause of what I have said here in the past. "But Matt!" You say. "How can you regret anything here if it's just a public forum for your private thoughts?" Oh, my dear friends, I can easily regret crushing someone's dream, or, at the very least, Blog, or, at the very least (again), website. I've come before all my readers of this Blog to issue an apology to someone very important to me. Someone very special to me. That person is...  Amanda, the female VJ of MuchMusic. I'm really sorry for what I've done, did, and what I'll probably do. It's just- What?  What's that?  Amanda, the female VJ of MuchMusic isn't the girl who's ire I've drawn? Then, who is it?  Alex? Alex Burke? What have I ever done to her?  *reads previous Blog entries*  Oh. Yeah. Well, I suppose I was a little fresh with her and her online forums of talking about stuff, so yeah. I'm sorry.   And Begin.  Hello, yes, I am back in the True North Strong and Free, O Canada! If you didn't already know, July the 8th I departed to the US of A, and more specifically, Attleboro Massachusetts... And even more specifically, the Steubenville East Youth Conference.  What is that? Well, it's basically a massive gathering of Catholics from New England and Canada to come together as one. It was really awesome, and if I even tried to tell you all that happened there, I'd be here for hours. So, I'll just leave it to a bare minimum. I like to think that, as a person, I've changed. I'm not the same Matt Vaughan anymore. The Matt Vaughan who swears in excess, the Matt Vaughan that is really sarcastic and jerkish towards people. I'm still fun to be around with, I'm just more fun now. It's like an upgrade really, like MSN. There are parts of MSN that really annoy you. Maybe it's that sound it makes when someone comes online or says something to you, maybe it's the lack of certain things. But with every update, MSN gets better. And for me, I've gotten better. I'm now Matt, v15.1 (See how the 15 is my age and the .1 is my change? Yeah, it's not that clever). I figured I'd tune you into the change, and maybe we'll get along better.  Another large change has occured in just the past few days. As many of you know, I have a mild obsession with Pepsi. I like to drink it as often as possible in as many ways as possible, be it cans, 591 ml bottles, 20 ounce bottles, 2 litre bottles, 1 litre bottles, etc. Well, another drink has caught my eye.  Dr Pepper.  Yes, the cherry cola drink was made apparent to me in a Burger King in Northern Maine. After recieving my Whopper, I proceeded to the soda fountain. Yeah, I said soda, so what? Anyway, I arrive there and see the little button that reads, "Dr Pepper". I hadn't try it in years, and it all came back to me in a flash of glory. So if you see me passing up a Pepsi for some Dr Pepper goodness, don't be alarmed: My life is changing.  Tomato Tomato, Potato Potato, lets call the whole thing off...

      Hello and greetings! Once again it's me, doing another update of Bloggy goodness. And, also once again, I don't remember the last time I updated so I'm not sure what I should tell you about, exactly.  Nor do I know who would read this.  "But Matt!" you say, "What about your friends? They always read the Blog, and they like it!."  I'm afraid to say I'm not sure they will read this update.  "But Matt!" you say, "Wh-"  What do you mean I already did that? Up there? Where? Let me go check. Oh. Ok. But yeah, I don't think they'll read it because we don't do many things together anymore. We don't really talk anymore. It's my fault, but I can't, for the life of me, figure out why I don't want to. I used to like hanging out with them every day, but now the only ones I can stand are Alex and Brian, mostly. Ian doesn't apply because he's not really in that group, so of course I'm still cool with him. But everyone else... I just don't like. I don't know why. I'm sorry.  In happier news, I was interviewed on Friday for the Daily News at my church about Life Teen. The reporter was pretty cool, and I was all nervous beforehand. But I got in there and she made it easy. On Saturday, I rushed to the church to get some pictures taken, which was cool. The article came out today, a bit shorter than I expected, but I haven't seen it in the paper yet, only on the web. The Daily New' website is http://www.hfxnews.com , so check around there for it. Or, go to your local store and pick up the paper and search for my grinning face amongst text.  That'll be it for today. I'm out.
