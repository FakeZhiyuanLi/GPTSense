						   Well through it all (my sister's grad party) today has been a pretty good day. I got to play disc-golf (my brother's portable thing), My friend got to come over even though he's grounded, and I got to see a couple of my favorite people (Alyson & Al). I love getting to see them and talk with them. They are like my other parents, but they're goofy enough to be my friends also [they're awesome!] So yeah I learned more about the "Arin's House" thing. It sounds really kool and I want to help out. Oh Oh Oh...  Invitations to some people to come hang out with me  [Warning: no one will probably see this so all these invitations are pointless, but then if you think about it so is this webpage. LoL] Any way the following people I have taken an interest in hanging out with them sometime [this means we all gotta do something and I'll find a way to get a hold of all of you and i'll figure out what we could do too]  The List Christine Eva Minh Nicole Haley Inga Scott McDonald Bobby & Kacyee Kirk Jessica  Lauren Erica Rachel Tracy Heather Kim  That's all I can think of for now. So I'll figure out something to do and makes some telephone calls and make it happen.  P.S. if you hadn't noticed most of the people on "The List" are from Westview... go figure. LoL.  Well talk to ya'll soon [i hope]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later (that movie never gets old)

						   Hokay so... today is my sister's graduation party and it will be pretty boring. Not to say that I'm not happy for her, I'm just simply stating my opinion of how it will be. I can say pretty confidently that it will be boring because I'm pretty sure what's going to happen. The adults will all talk and my sister and her friends will talk and my friend, (lives down the street) all he'll want to do is play or do stupid stuff and frankly I think I've been spending too much time with him... or too little time with my other friends. Either way I need to get outta the house sometime and just be by myself for the day. I would really like to go see that new movie called "The Notebook" ~hint hint nudge nudge [to any of you who would like to see it or would like to see me, but I'm guessing it's the first one]~ anyway if anyone wants to go see that movie with me give me a call on my wireless [wireless sounds sooo much kooler than cell] o yeah i guess you people need the number... wait who am i talking to? There are two possibilities.  Option 1). A 45 yr old man is reading this getting turned on thinking about raping me [eww] because he's a pervert... or  Option 2). No one is reading this in which case I would prefer this over option 1.  Well if there is somebody out there reading this and they "know me" [qoutes because some people might stalk me and think they know me even if I've never met them in my life] then call my wireless. I won't be holding my breath for any calls anytime soon so don't worry about living up to any expectations.  I guess there is really nothing much else to say, even though this whole post is just a bunch of pish posh [me rambling on about stupid, unimportant stuff]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later

						   People tell me I didn't betray him, but the truth is I did. There were so many oppertunities for me to go and talk to him or just say "hi", but i didn't use any of them. He was an awesome guy and whenever somebody says something about him I feel really proud to know that I was his friend and that he chose me that day in second grade to come and hang out with them, but how do i repay him? By ignoring and cutting off contact with him. Some friend I am. Well I'm gonna make a new post about something else so I don't have to think about this right now. catch you cats on the flip flop later

						   Ok so I said I would post again after I got back from the party, but first off I didn't really feel like it (you'll find out a little later in this post) and secondly my comp wasn't working properly.  So About that party. Well the first hour or so nobody danced except for me doing these funny chicken dances and other stupid stuff (totally unserious, just trying to get the crowd going) eventually people started dancing. I was having fun break-dancing and joking around with people. I was talking to pretty much everyone, except Kendyl. I went up to talk to her (twice) and the first time she ran outside and the second time she turned around and started dancing/talking with some girls that I don't know that well. Then for like the last 30 min she spent the whole time talking to Derek Lahey (or however you spell it) and I'm not positive, but I think she gave him her number and all that stuff. I don't wanna go around talking bad about her, but I can't help but wonder if she does this very often. I mean meet a guy at a party and lead them on and then go on and find someone new? I hope I'm not just one of those flavor of the week and I hope that she doesn't do that. Well I did notice that I danced more, actually towards the end I had about 5 girls aroundme dancing. Does anyone know why... because I'm a P.I.M.P. Hah j/k. So anyway. Today I'm gonna go to the mall and cash in my coins and just go out for lunch and basically take a long walk and think/reflect on yesterdays going-ons. That's it for now, I'll check back in later. Catch you cats on the flip flop later.

						   Hokay so I'm going to a party tonight and my least favorite thing to do besides go to school is go to parties. I hate the way kids act towards me. First off I'm a shy guy so I don't say much, but when I do the "crowd" I'm around always goes silent. I think it's because I have no history with anybody. I just hang out at my house or run or go to basketball tournament/ camps. I don't hang out with anyone which I know is my fault, but I only do it cause I'm afraid of people not liking me. It happened all through MS and I don't want it to happen again... but I also don't want to miss out on stuff. Idk I'm stuck. I really need to find some true friends [sheesh]. Well I'll post again after the party, Until then I'll catch you cats on the flip flop later.

						   Well i guess i need three different online journals to get my views out to my different groups of friends. Well as the title says many people think they know me, but they don't.   If you wanna get to know me read this and maybe you will.  Today was pretty good. Woke up at 600 am at my friend's house (stayed the night and we played Need For Speed: Underground) and i was supposed to go home then, but i fell back asleep and didn't wake up until 7:30 again. I went home got a little breakfast and then hopped in the shower. I went to X-C conditioning and it was mega-awesome. I got to lead the pack and set the pace. At first I was scared because I always went to fast when setting the pace for the J.V. guys, but now that I'm with the V guys I geuss I'm better. This is where I'm meant to be. So anyway practice went great and nothing aches or is sore which is a plus. So, Paul Calvert (senior) gave me and J-Long (junior, looks like me) a ride home and then I got on the comp and played Unreal Tournament 2004 (demo) and then I went up to the dollar tree to meet Anisia and go shopping for the food for the party. We got some stuff and then high-tailed it outta there and went to the bank and Anisia's mom asked me if I knew how to work the coin machine and i did, but we didn't end up using it at all. LoL. So Anisia got money out and then we went to Costco. Soon Anisia spotted one of her friends and she left me to go off with her mom (very akward). Finally she caught up with us again and then it took her like 20-25 min to decide what she wanted to get for the party and then we left and Anisia's mom dropped me off at the church by Arin's house because she didn't know I lived back towards Barnes. So I ran really fast back home because I had a Trio meeting to go to about the basketball/streetball tournament i'm going to in Idaho. Then I cam home and my dad had to go back to forest grove to take care of one of his tennants problems (he had to leave father's day too). So i ate dinner with my mom and my grandma and my great aunt. (My grandma and Great aunt are visiting for the week) Then I got online and talked to Eva for a bit and realized that she hadn't been invited to the party so I was about to ask her, but she had already signed off. She does that alot, signs off and doesn't say "bye", maybe it's because of our past. Idk, but one thing I do know (that I have never told anybody) is that everyday since the accident I have felt ashamed. I've felt ashamed for loving her and i try to tell my self that Arin was my friend long before I loved Eva and so the day of the accident i made a promise to him and said that she would always be his and that I would only make sure she was being safe and happy, so yeah. Wow that's the first time I've ever said that and I feel like the biggest weight has been lifted off my shoulders. well i guess i should end with that because it's getting late (when you wake up at 600am during the summer 930 becomes late [runnings a biatch]) well i guess i'll see ya'll around even though nobody will ever read this anyway, nobody ever does. Catch you cats on the flip, flop later.

						   I feel much better and I have figured out what to do. My mom has been reading these journals and commenting and at first it was annoying because she was trying to be sneaky about it, but now I don't mind cause she's going to look at it wether she comments or not. So I've decided to wait for Anisia to figure out if she thinks we had something more than just a crush and if that is, then if she wants to give us another try. I know it's not supposed to end so quick and in such confusion. It doesn't end that way when you feel this way about the other person, it ends with you knowing that it was worth it and that the other person truly cared about you and so far I still have doubts and that's why I need another chance with her, that way I'll know for sure if she.......... truly loves me.  Love you all Bye

						   I had a really big post that I was typing up last night, but it got erased. Stupid computer. Oh well it wasn't really important and only about two people (maybe just eva) read this thing anyway.  I think I should discuss the title of my blog.  "Who do you think I am................ 'cause I'm not"  What this means is that a lot of people think they know me, but in all reality... Nobody has hung out with me or talked to me enough to know the real me. I don't even express my true self on this thing. So for all of you out there who think you have me all figured out you're wrong and I'm almost certain of this. I know of only two people who know the real me or at least understand the real me.  Bottom Line= I'm not as sweet and inocent of a guy as you all may think. Sure I'm a romantic, but there is an evil side to me too and lately I feel like it's trying to come out. I hate when people swear and I just hate the thought of swearing, but this is a special occasion.  My life is fucked up  Bye

						   When I hear the word "pimp" I don't think of these rappers on MTV or BET, but I think of James Bond. James Bond was the first real "pimp". I mean he could have any girl he wanted and as many as he wanted. Personally not my idol, I believe there should only be one other at a time, not multiple partners at once. Maybe for some that's acceptable. Okay enough of me trying to understand up to date things like pimps. So, How is everyone doing out there? Good? Good, that's good to hear. Today I doubled up on my runs, and at conditioning it was Bo, Alex, Skuyler and I. We dropped skuyler after 6 minutes and then with like 1/2-3/4 of a mile left I started pulling away from Bo and Alex. It was kool, but then I decided I should slow down cause it was supposed to be an easy run. Well enough of that boring run stuff, now onto... actually onto nothing cause I have to go do my dishes. Talk to you all soon (i hope)  Love you all  bye  "Just thinking of you makes my life even better,  and just knowing you care makes me feel whole.

						   Well I got back on Friday and today is sunday. I would have posted earlier, but my mom didn't want me using the computer in the heat (103 degrees). Well anyway. camp was good as usual. My third year there... I don't know if it was the best year, but it was a good one. My team won the championship (yay!). During the regular league games we were 7-2, but in most of our games I only scored like 2-4 points except for one when I was on fire and scored 10 points. Yay me, but anyway it was a good week and I'm ready for more basketball now. Hope you all had fun while I was gone and hope I talk to you soon.   Love you all&nbsp;

						   Today I kind of did nothing. I woke up, went on a quick run and then came home and showered. Then I got my book out [haven't looked at that thing in almost a year]. Anyways, I got it out and started looking at it and then I decided that I was going to type up the third chapter caues I knew that wasn't on my computer yet, but then when I went to check I found out that my second chapter had been erased so now I have to type that up too. UGH. I also came to the conclusion that my second chapter is too long because in other books like the wedding [that's the one I'm holding so i used that as an example] page 65 is the fifth chapter, but in mine that's in the middle of chapter three. Page 65 and I'm still in the THIRD CHAPTER!!! I've done edits on it like 50 times I can't cut anything else out. Oh well I don't care if people don't like their second chapters about 30 pages long they can deal. Although more than likely I'll never finish it. I'm the worste writer in the world. I mean in quality I'm ok, but I just take so long to write. I started this book on May 8th 2001 and now it's July 16th 2004 and I'm still on the third Chapter. Jeesh. Well anyway I should go pack for my basketball camp so I'll talk to everyone soon I hope.Luv ya allBye

						   Yesterday was kind of boring until night came. &nbsp; Morning: Went running with Skuyler again. [really slow pace] rented "The Perfect Score" and then came home and watched that. Asian guy is totally hilarious and also Darius Miles is in it [from the Blazers]. Oh and the main character's name is Kyle so that was kool too. &nbsp; Afternoon: Talked to Anisia and read "The Wedding" for a bit under my tree. &nbsp; Night: I decided that I should go to church last night instead of waiting for this weekend and then I'll be leaving for camp. So I went last night and I showed up early so I sat down on a bench and read a couple pages from "The Wedding" and then Matt [the pastor] came up and told me I came at the most peaceful time and I agreed and then he said that he didn't know my name so I told him I was new and he got really excited. Then about fifteen minutes later Samie, Anisia and Tony showed up. So I gave Tony money to get some food from the barbeque and then after mingling with some of the kids for about 30 minutes we went inside and I just went inside and shot around until the service started. Then we all went and sat down and started singing. Then Matt got up and asked some of the kids to come up and share what they got out of camp. After everyone finished Matt went up and started speaking and then we all prayed and I got saved. After we all prayed we broke off into other small prayer groups. So first I went up with a group of older kids and they prayed for me and then I went over to Samie, Anisia, Tony and Josh [i think] and then we all prayed together and then Tony and I just walked around for a while and then Samie took me asides and prayed for me [Thank you Samie that meant a lot to me]. The we all just kind of hung out and then it was time to go, but I couldn't find my bag so I got a little scared, but eventually I found it and it was kind of funny because I realized that I had walked right by it before. lol Oh well so my mom called and ended up picking me up because it was dark.I feel like a big wheight has been lifted off of me. &nbsp; Today &nbsp; Morning: I went to Sunset for conditioning. Lavelle and Blair we're there. I kind of set pace, but lavelle was doing that mostly. Then I came home. &nbsp; Afternoon now I'm here reading "The Wedding" and I might go see the Notebook today [if anyone wants to go then call me] I'll also be calling people that I would like to go. Well that's it for now. &nbsp; Bye

						   I have support on my ideas of falling in love at a young age.   First Evidence of Support: Some one left a comment on my last post [first comment in a long time] and they agreed. You can read that for proof.  Second Evidence of Support: This morning I watched  Love Actually  and there was boy about 10 or 11 years old and well basically he falls in love with this girl and so yeah. You're never too young.  I also figured out why I can never keep a relationship going. It's because I love watching people in love. So for example I'm always so inclined to watch Anisia being in love that I forget to love her back. I just worry about getting her to love me when I should worry about loving her more. I'm sorry Anisia and to anyone else I ever dated. It was my mistake and now that I have discovered it I will fix my habits and hopefully be a better man because of it.  I love you know who

						   A lot of people think age matters in many different things in life. For some things it does, but does it matter in cases of love... People thought in my freshman year that I wouldn't be good at sports because I was short and young, but on cross country I was one of the top JV runners ahead of a couple juniors and sophmores. Then in track I went out and got the third fastest time on the 1500m out of everyone on the long distance team. Also on my tournament this weekend I knew I'd be going up against juniors and seniors, but that made me try harder and I did better than most people [including me] thought i would. So i surprised them in two ways. First because of my age they thought i wouldn't do that good. Then also because of my sking color. About 50% of the kids there were black then 45% were hispanic and then 5% were white. Of course the stereotype that white guys aren't good at basketball came into play with a lot of the other teams we played so they weren't expecting me to be so good. So i was a short, young, white guy. Not a good mix, except for me it worked out. Well now since all those things happened why can't I fall in love at my age. One of my cross country team mates was talking about his ex-girlfriend and how much he loved her and how he didn't know if she would take him back after a year or so of being apart and I asked if he wanted advice or just words of consolation and he turned toward me and said "You don't know what love is" I couldn't believe he just said that. I, not know what love is" I love my family more than anything and i love my friends with all my heart. I also had a past love too. So he was out of line to say that, but that's in the past and I don't like to hold grudges, but it is my belief that you are never too young to fall in love...or too old for that matter. If you read  The Notebook  you'll understand that you can fall in love anytime, anyplace and under any circumstances. Gosh that is the greatest book ever written.  I love you know who  [and I don't mean Voldemort from  Harry Potter ]lol

						   Today I went running with skuyler. Pretty fun I guess.... [boring actually] but I just found out nicole saw me running. I guess the rest of the day I'm going to go up to the store and buy  the wedding  again and then sit under my tree and read it. That should be nice. Sorry this is short but I'm not really sure about a lot of stuff right now so I guess I'll post later.  I love you

						   It's good to be bak. I had a lot of fun and played the best I've ever played before [basketball] I finished "The Notebook" and I have to say that I didn't think a person could become so attached to fictional characters. The critics said that the last chapter would make you cry and I didn't believe it because I've never cried over a book, but I did cry. It was sad and amazing at the same time. I would tell you all about it, but most of you have already seen the movie [*sad face* I haven't seen the movie] but it was an excellent book and I would recomend it to anyone who believes in true love. Then I started "The Wedding". Again a great book [even though I'm only on page 30] but my bag got stolen while I was in Boise [my cell phone charger/both those books i mentioned/a lot of cd's/house key/my snacks for the bus ride] So that sucked, but I'll get over it. I'm nervous about calling anisia though. I haven't been this nervous about something in the longest time. Well I'm going to go eat something cause I haven't in like 5 hours.   I love you anisia

						   This week has been really tough on me because I don't really know how you feel about me/us. I made a mistake in saying some of the things I did in my internet journals. The things about eva were just because we went without talking for two years and I was just scared of her not talking to me again, but I shouldn't have said those things I did and for that I'm sorry. The thing with kendyl I think I explained pretty clearly. I did want to get to know her [and if i found that I liked her it might have gone somewhere] but i never got to know her well enough, but somebody i did get to know better was you, and I started to like you. When I asked you out it surprised me too, but I knew it was the right thing to do... and I know your the right one for me. If you decide we should just be friends I will support your decision and try to be the best friend ever, but you must know:  "Nothing is ever really lost, or can be"   and this holds true for my love towards you. That love can't be lost and I will cherish all the times we've had before and the times to come [wether we're more than friends or not.] I might have told you this already, but I guess I could share it with you once more. The moment I met you [the day samie introduced me to you] I knew at that moment that I would fall for you somehow, I just didn't know it would be this strong of a feeling. I have been doing a lot of thinking while you were gone and I have come to the conclusion that I want to be with you the rest of my life... whatever direction our relationship takes us, wether we decide to take things to another level or just remain friends, even if it means that we just think about each other and call each other from time to time, I want to be with you. And I just want you to know that you will forever be in my mind.  I will always love you Kyle/Ky/Keelay [whichever you prefer] I can be anything you want

						   Two days until I leave for Idaho. 12 hour drive. I don't know how I'm going to get through it, but my mom is getting me the sequel to  The Notebook ,  The Wedding . It's about Noah and Allie's son in law [i guess they had a daughter] and how he needs to find his love again for his wife. It should be a good read. Well not much else to post about now. I'll have a message for someone tomorrow though.   I love you

						   On Monday you told me you needed a break and I felt devastated. I took off running and got across the street and collapsed underneath a tree. I stayed there lying on the ground for about 20 minutes thinking about what I did wrong. It was a sad time for me and yet the next day I came up to that same spot and lied underneath that tree and felt at peace. It made me question myself, How did I find comfort in this place, the place that I broke down and cried at just the day before. So I lied down and started reading/ watching the clouds and it felt so calming. I could hear the birds chirping above my head and the "wizz" of the cars as they pass by in almost a rythmical pattern. It was really relaxing and I think I might go up there again tomorrow. It's one of my favorite places now.  I love you

						   I had the weirdest dream last night.   Ok so there was a spider in my house and my mom was about to kill it, but I stopped her because I don't like to kill bugs [they haven't done anything to me] so anyway she told me to get it out of her house then. So I took a piece of the newspaper from that morning and tried to get it on the piece of paper, but it just kept running away from it and then [like magic] I saw the spider turn into a cat. It was really crazy. So I kept the cat as my own and it's really cool. I hope it doesn't turn into a bear, cause then I'll be attacked in my dreams. ooo Freddy Kruger. yikes. Well yeah that was just really weird so i thought I should tell someone. Wow my brain is really starting to get all screwed up again.    I love you

						   " The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this good-bye is both a good-bye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come. When I look at you, I see your beauty and grace and know they have grown stronger with every life you have lived. And I know I have spent every life before this one searching for you. Not someone like you, but you, for your soul and mine must always come together. And then, for a reason neither of us understands, we've been forced to say good-bye. I would love to tell you that everything will work out for us, and I promise to do all I can to make sure it does. But if we never meet again and this truly is good-bye, I know we will see each other again in another life. We will find each other again, and maybe the stars will have changed, and we will not only love each other in that time, but for all the times we've had before."  I love you anisia

						     Your soul is OPTIMISTIC. You tent to look to the brighter side of things, and your positive outlook on life makes others happy. People love your open, unassuming nature and your innocent belief in good  for you, the grass on your side of the fence is always greener. You are rarely, if ever, pessimistic or doubtful, and you try your hardest to make life the best it can be, for yourself and others.

						   The road trip was amazing. I'm glad you came along for the ride. I don't know how I was ther one driving but I was. So we started driving and we just going for like 2 days straight. Finally we ended up in Massechusettes and you showed me your old neighbor hood and we you lived and all your friends back there. Then it was time to go home, so we got in the car and drove off, but i woke up before we got home. The car ride back was great though. We spent the whole ride talking about your childhood and mine. It was excellent.  I love you

						   Idk what to think... the note said that she thought i had deeper feelings for eva than i thought and that she thought i actually liked kendyl. She said that while she was gone I should think about all of that and she will too, but until then we're just friends. So for the next 7 days I'm going to be wondering if this break up is final or if i still have another shot. Maybe I should explain some things [even though she won't see this until she gets back]  1). Kendyl    I was interested in getting to know kendyl and I did think she was cute, but in terms of me actually liking her, i don't know if I ever got to know her well enough, but during those times when I was getting to know her I got to know you better and I realized that I was looking at the wrong girl. The when we went to commonwealth and you asked me if I had to pick some one besides kendyl I already knew that you were it and that i didn't have to pick you besides kendyl because kendyl wasn't in the picture.  2). Eva    There's something people need to know about eva and I [especially you, anisia] Everyone has a first love. For some people their first love is their true love. For others it may take them a couple times of falling in love to find that special person. I can't lie to you [I still love eva] but like i said she's not that special person. We fell in love back in 7th grade and then things just didn't work out and now we're just friends. I still love her, but it wouldn't work out because we just want to be friends and that's what we decided back in 7th grade. I don't know when I'll find that special person or if i ever will, but i do know that you are special to me and you're the only one I want to be with.  I'm so sorry that I never explained any of this to you before.  I hope you can find it in you to give me another chance and this time i'll make things right. I love you.

						   The image still lingers. Haunting me night after night bfore i fall asleep. It screws with my head making me weep. It makes my everyday chores harder accomplish and it's screwing up my love life. I'm sorry [you know who] for not trusting you before. For thinking you would go behind my back. I should have known better that your not like that. Every one always say I'm a nice little boy, but how nice am i if i couldn't even trust my own girlfriend. I feel so ashamed and aweful. I don't know how to make it up to you except say that I'm sorry and that from now on things will be different. I trust you 100% and always will. I hope you can forgive me. luv ya  catch you cats on the flip flop later

						   Most of the time I get mad at people for saying things like "I hate my parents" but I do find myself getting annoyed with some of the things my mom does. Like she comes out and sits right by me while I'm IMing people and then I have to halt my conversation and nothing is said until she leaves. If I was hiding anything from her that was potentially harmful to myself then I'm sure I wouldn't be talking about it with my friends. I understand that she wants to be a part of my life, but if she waited for me to share information with her then she'd probably get more outta me. Catch you cats on the flip flop later

Then took a shower ate breakfast... all that fun stuff and went to X-country. small turnout [3 guys 2 girls] So i was the fastest guy there and i had to set the pace [i hate that] So anyway I had no way of reaching anisia after that [we were going to go to commonwealth] so i went home. Now I'm talking to her online and she hurt her back skating. [i'm sorry anisia] But she doesn't seem like her normal self right now so I'm gonna go figure out that.

						   When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary; When troubles come and my heart burdened be; Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, Until you come and sit awhile with me.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up: To more than I can be.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up: To more than I can be.  There is no life - no life without its hunger; Each restless heart beats so imperfectly; But when you come and I am filled with wonder, Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up: To more than I can be.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up: To more than I can be.  I love this song!  Love you all Bye

						   Um well yeah not much to say. Jeesh i don't have a lot to say lately do i? I'm boring. Well.... maybe I'll just post lyrics that's always fun to do.  Clay Aiken-When You Say You Love Me  I've been watchin' you from afar and the way you make your way 'round the bar You act like you're really entertained And your smile like it's your favorite game Now you're movin' closer to me And our eyes connected emotionally I'm not lookin' for a one night stand (stand) Or a place for a broken heart to mend (mend)  I know everybody here wants to hold ya I know what it's like 'cause I feel the same (same, same) When you look in my eyes There's a part of me that's still afraid  When you say you love me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time To hear you say you love me Like you mean it All I wanna do is make you mine I've been hurt way too many times  They say if you wanna make God laugh (yeah) All ya gotta do is tell him your plans I know that the time is not right (right, right) Didn't know that I would meet you tonight (night, night) Not that I don't really like the attention I feel like the only man in the room Are you really sincere? Is this just something that you do?  Now when you say you love me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time Like you mean it Baby, when you hold me Make me feel it All I wanna do is make you mine I've been hurt way too may times  Again, and again, and again I've been hurt, my friend, till the end You know I been high, I been low I got no place left to go Again, and again, and again When will this search ever end?  When you say you loe me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time To hear you say you love me Like you mean it Baby, when you hold me Make me feel it All I wanna do is make you mine I will wait until the end of time Baby, say you love me Come on, baby, say you love me Oh Ooooo To hear you say you love me Baby, say you love me

						   Nothing much to say. I got to talk to Abby and Maggie and Anisia today. They called earlier and they just called a few minutes ago (they're at a Clay concert and they called me to let me listen) That was kool. Well not much else happened today. Yeah, but doing nothing was worth getting those phone calls.  Love you all Bye   "Just thinking of you makes my life even better, and just knowing you care makes me feel whole. You'll always be my friend and forever the one I love."

						   Hi everyone I'm bak from camping and you can check out my live journal for the run-down. Not that exciting, but at least it's not about anisia (for those of you out there who are tired of me talking about my feelings for her) [ugh] Well Church was fun tonight. We went to the bowling alley and bowled. It was kool. The first game we played I didn't get one single strike or spare until the 10th frame when I got three strikes in a row and it was then that my nickname became Vin Deisil because on the score board it had a triple x. "XXX" nice. Oh but before all that (like before church) Anisia called and that was a pleasant surprise. So we talked for a while and I got to hear what Maggie's voice sounds like and I have to say...from her voice she sounds like she's hott. lol. Any way then I went bak to taking my nap and then got online for a while and talked to who else but Anisia and Maggie. I told anisia a little bit more about how I feel but I always feel like if i told her how I truely feel it would make things akward between us and that she wouldn't understand. Idk, but we're going to talk about things when she gets back, hopefully not immediately though cause I think we should see how things are working out as friends still.  Love you all Bye
