      Some people will tell you that there is no reason to not wear leather, because it's just a by-product of the animal industry that will go to waste. However, research by University of Minnesota faculty member Carl V. Phillips shows that leather accounts for 3.8% of the profits made by raising cattle. If the leather business were to disappear, approximately 2% fewer cows would be slaughtered each year. To put this in perspective, that is more than a million cows per year. Leather is not a harmless by-product.    that's right asshole, eat it up.

      two nights ago, i was wondering through a field in my dreams. there were these great plants, towering a few feet above my head, blooming bright read and white speckled blossoms, and as they bloomed it seems i was watching something i was not supposed to, as they bloomed 100 times faster then any plant, but the blossum seemed it would not wilt ever. i ran farther, down to a hill and stood on top, looking across vast mountain sides, hills, and valleys covered in these plants all blooming and it was all visible, and between the colour and the rate of blossum, everything seemed so surreal like a video game i was inside of. i wandered down farther to a circular cement pond and sat on the edge, somehow aware that my family and i were suposed to make it spin because if we did something with the large lamp-like thing in the middle would happen and a magical squirrel.. :x.. would come from the tower in front of us and tell us our fortune, but it turned out to be a person in a costume with a few sarcastic remarks i do not remember. i only remember looking at it's feet. the rest of my dream was spent running and running from this man who thought him to be over control of me, and no matter how fast i would run he would chase me getting closer and closer, and finally i said to a man "this man will  not leave me alone, please help me" and ran away and the man stopped the other and held him off as much as he could.  in all my dreams i always seems to be running away from something. i'm beganning to wonder what that something really is.

      it seems my body is just drying out, and becoming brittle, and all my nights just blend  into morning and it seems like i can never rest one second or it will be a job wrong done. tonight my stomach hurt, and it was overly cold outside, and zachary said there was  probably a storm coming our way. i would enjoy a storm to help me sleep better tonight,  but i was disappointed to learn about cold fronts meaning storms and not that fall was  coming. i want fall to come. when it does, most of the leaves will fall off all the trees, and  cover the streets, and the rain will come and make them stick, and when i walk my shoes will make quiet little noises against the pavement. i like those noises. and i like when it's cold enough to need a scarf, and cold enough to make your cheeks and nose pink. i like when it's cold enough to share mittens with zac. my eyes are ever so heavy. i just hope they will usher me into a deep sleep of well rest.
