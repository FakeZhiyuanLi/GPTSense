      An particularly widly read person may be aware from other sites that I have written that:  "I'd had enough of the utter hopelessness of what I have been uncovering. So I have written a letter to the local MP. He kindly wrote back saying I should meet with him to talk about the 'issues'. This is a) A brush off or b) A good thing. I am unsure which as yet. "  I have written back asking pointy questions about: healthcare, Domestic violence and custody issues.  In light of up coming European parliamentary Elections I asked that perhaps they would forward me any printed material they have expressing their views on the subject.  After all the conservative party is large enough to have produced leaflets on every subject on the earth by now.  Mr Gale wrote back saying:  "I am not entirely certain that the issues you raise are specifically relevant to the European Parliamentary Elections or that, therefore, there is 'any printed material' of the kind to which you refer."   So the conservative party do not think that these issues are relevant...  Or to say it clearly they find them irrelevant to Europe.  Perhaps they might be shocked if we bring up some EU rules on the subject?  Like human rights rulings... I will investigate.

        Discrimination against men is outlined in our publication of that name. The major areas of concern are :    the divorce racket and social policies which reduce men's rights in the     family   state pension entitlement   health care provision for men   lack of equal educational and training provisions to men   less than fair treatment in civil and criminal law   women-only facilities, without any equivalent for men   the imbalance of men's groups, in numbers and resources available,    compared with women's   the general denigration of men, and lack of representation of men's issues    in the media    the lack of representation of men's issues by MPs, in Parliament, and by    the Government.     Anecdotal evidence started to accumulate in the various father's and men's groups about the treatment of men, but without any organised attempted to quantify or publish reports on the situation. Of the issues listed above, it is matrimonial and family law, and social policies about the family, which have had the hardest effects on men. It has been no surprise that groups addressing these issues first arose.  In the late1990s the Internet became generally available, and men were able to network, not only in the UK, but world-wide. The lack of information through the press and media was remedied. The same treatment of men prevails in all Western World countries, including Europe, North America and Australia/New Zealand.    While this site does provide some resource it is not a primium sorce of data yet.

      It is vital if one is to run any sort of campeign, that there be available relaibale statisics that have not been altered beyond use.  More than that the statisics must be generated from a resonaable population sample - it is not enough that one report show something it only becomes truely ecceptable if many reports show the same thing.  We can provide some statistical evidence of course but you the researcher may also be called upon to provide indipendantly obtained data.   A word of warning on that subject: the plural of anicdote is not data, but many people including leaders can sometimes be mistaken into believing that many isolated stories equates to facts.    urlLink http://www.coeffic.demon.co.uk  - This is a good source of precompiled data.   urlLink stats1.PDF  - This is a PDF of the pages should they nolonger be available.

      The sad truth is that this small site could in fact be the best resource for ending the Gender war than any other "Man's Lib", "father's rights" or "Male Pride" site on the internet at the moment.    That is not pride, just the sad conclusion that has driven this site into being.  We will aim to cover the issues one by one in depth and properly.  We will examine relevant news when it occurs and provide a regular digest of the facts for our readers.  We aim to provide every link and resource necessary for campaigners and researchers to get to the bottom of the issues.

      In light of this controversial "speaking-out" it MUST be pointed out that there will always be two sides to every story.  In a "He said - she said" fight "She" will have done wrong as much as "He" will.  The fact of the matter that no matter the side you crown as saint that saint will be as much a sinner as the "evil-one" you have chosen to hate.  Sometimes there are manipulative people some male some female.  Some-times there is an aggressor and they are called the victim and the victim may be called the aggressor.  When something exposes the truth this can only be good.  But when some-one is the voice of that truth half of the listeners will call out liar.  Nothing is proven and nothing is gained.  When a liar is believed it is usually until the believer experiences the truth personally.  No one likes their illusions shattered.  When you choose to become involved the mud sticks to you too.  All that you will do is paint yourself the "extra-evil-one" in some-one's world.  You will not make your life longer nor ease the situation or help anyone.  Just stay out of it.  All of you.     This was an editorial opinion.

        "Is it true, though, that the male point of view is not being represented? In a study of more than 1200 headlines from seven high circulation Canadian newspapers, women were referred to as victims of violence thirty-five times for each one reference to men as victims.3 Not a single article focused on men.4 Compare this to the reality: Men are three times as likely to be victims of murder, twice as likely to be victims of non-domestic violence, and equally as likely to be victims of domestic violence, but the study found that newspapers virtually ignore the violence against men in each of these areas � no matter who the perpetrator."

      This is the email and address it was sent to.    public.enquiries@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk   In light of the 1994 MORI poll conducted for the BBC's Here and Now which revealed that 6.3 million people across 150 constituencies have been subjected to physical aggression by a wife, husband or heterosexual partner with the greater proportion of the victims being male: why do you still attempt to hold such an untenable possition 10 years later.  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/domesticviolence/  You site currently fails over 50% of domestic violence sufferers.  In the US they recognise that when a wmoen is violent she is mostly likely to be violent against a member of family and it ends with death often.   "Murder is the most prevalent violent offense among female inmates" -- http://www.menweb.org/throop/battery/studies/by-gender.html   U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics  Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin Women in Prison NCJ-145321  The number of women sentenced for a violent offense rose from 8,045 to 12,400 during the 5-year period. Murder, the most prevalent violent offense among female inmates in 1991, accounted for just over a third of the women sentenced for a violent offense.  Violent female inmates and their victims In 1991 nearly two-thirds of the women in prison for a violent offense had victimized a relative, intimate, or someone else they knew. Women serving a sentence for a violent offense were about twice as likely as their male counterparts to have committed their offense against someone close to them (36% versus 16%). Another third of the women, but more than half of the men, had victimized a stranger.    I take it the potential civil rights issues been identified as they could cost (me) the taxpayed Billions is class action law suits sooner or later.  This information (above) dated 28 Nov 95 is not new.  Why has the home office been so slow in responding?      Regards  Mr M. Brown

      It seems that everywhere I look recently I notice the ever emerging lines of gender war.    urlLink ramble on: f*** you- and you- and you- and you. I hate men. I hate them and their highly charged libido. I wish I could rid the world of men. Albeit, the greatest people to walk the earth were mostly men, I could still do without a few billion of them. They gawk and stare. They look into your eyes, as if trying to rob you of your chastity. They rape you with their stares. They undress you with their eyes. They make you naked with their ogling. They try to keep you under. Under them, that is. The only boulder in the path of the rise to my gender- men. The roles must have been switched by accident- God wouldn’t have ever wanted women to be so suppressed. Right? and always it is the same.  Hate + God.  As if by refering a religiouse system it gives value to the bigotry expressed.  This is wrong no matter how you cut it.  This hate must stop.

        urlLink Argument : "Children need fathers. The empirical proof is that children are hugely damaged by having their fathers effectively removed from their day-to-day lives. Indeed, some experts have argued that is, in fact, a form of child abuse to deprive children of their father. What is involved is a human rights issue for the child, something which is recognised in countries like Denmark, Sweden and some US states, where a 50:50 access split is the norm."  "Nor is it clear why it would work to give courts powers to impose community-based orders, such as voluntary work, on recalcitrant mothers who repeatedly flout the access arrangements the court has imposed. At present, tens of thousands of fathers each spend thousands of pounds trying to enforce court orders which their ex-wives just ignore. Although judges have the power to impose prison sentences for persistent and deliberate breaches. they rarely believe it is in the interests of the child to send a mother to prison. They do, however, send 40 women to jail a year for not paying their TV licence. What price the kids then?  Nor is it clear, in a week when the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have made such play on boorishness, yob culture and social misbehaviour, why they have missed the clear link between fatherlessness and the explosion in young offending. What was needed was for the Government to send a clear message about the equal, but different, importance of the mother and father in the upbringing of children. They have missed their chance."

        urlLink ic Liverpool - Fathers attack new access plans : "But children's minister Margaret Hodge said the rights of the child always had to come first and insisted there was no gender bias in the court system. She said the new proposals would encourage parents to go through a mediation process to find a solution to their problems instead of going to court."  Which is an open ticket for mothers who wish to "get revenge" to delay for up to three years any quality contact between father and child.  That is a length of time that is pleanty long enough for the spite and hate of the mother against the father to be indoctrinated into the children.  This is bad.  Bad for the children.  Bad for the father and bad for the law and oprder of this country that will in the 16 to 25 years to follow have a 20 to 60% increased chance of haveing to deal with these fatherless children.  That is tax payer money that could be spent else where!  That makes it everyones problem.

      This is the reply that we have sent.   Reference : T20275/4  Thank you for your considered if somewhat slow response to my enquiries.  However certain concerns still remain.  This concerns are focused around the home office website.  In your site, which you have changed before responding to my concerns: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/domesticviolence/  You claim: "claims the lives of two women each week" and while this is shocking it fails to reflect the truth showing only women as victims and giving the unspoken lie to the idea that men must therefore be the aggressor.  "Launched in December 2003, this 24-hour free phone joins together the existing help lines of Women’s Aid and Refuge to offer women and children access to emergency refuge accommodation, an information service, safety planning and translation facilities."   Yet where is the help and support for men? This statement suggests to me that you feel men are not entitled or undeserving in someway of any help.  Am I to assume that you endorse the view of Manohari Subramaniam's that "men are potential rapists"?    In what can you do section you give two options: "1) Call the national help line – 0808 2000 247" and second class citizens may call "2) Male Advice & Enquiry Line - 0845 064 6800"  This is hardly the equality and fairness that one expects of a forward thinking country and only serves to increase the already widening gulf between the genders as indicated by the rise of such groups as "Fathers for Justice".  It is clear to me that there are significant underlieing assumptions about the "worthiness" of men and their entitlement to assistance.  I am extremely worried that this uneven approach that does not directly address all the issues will result in a two-tier system with the bulk of the help going to the top tier and the dregs to the lower (male) tier.  How are you helping to stop the fracturing of society that as a taxpayer I could end up paying for?  As your website is seen by millions I wish to know what further action you intend to take.

        urlLink The Gender-Freedom Alliance UK: homeoffice.gov.uk Gender issues raised. : "In light of the 1994 MORI poll conducted for the BBC's Here and Now which revealed that 6.3 million people across 150 constituencies have been subjected to physical aggression by a wife, husband or heterosexual partner with the greater proportion of the victims being male: why do you still attempt to hold such an untenable possition 10 years later.  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/domesticviolence/"   This was the opening of an email sent a month ago to the home office.  They have finally responded and the letter is reporduced in whole here:   Dear Mr Brown   Thank you for your email of 26 June to the Home Office regarding male victims of domestic violence.  I have been asked to respond to your email.  Across Government, we are indeed committed to preventing domestic violence from happening in the first place, and protecting and supporting those who are victims regardless of their gender, whilst also working to dispel the myth that men are always the perpetrators of domestic violence and women are the victims.  We want to ensure that people are aware that men as well as women can be, and are, victims of domestic violence and this is why we have included a provision in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill to expand the definition of associated person, as set out in the Family Law Act 1996, to include same-sex cohabiting couples. We are also working closely with a range of specialist organisations around how best to support those from different communities.  In December 2003, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill was introduced to the House of Lords.   The Bill is a significant part of our work in tackling domestic violence, with the aim of placing victims and witnesses at the centre of the Criminal Justice System.  This builds onto the Government's ongoing reform of the justice system in favour of victims and witnesses rather than offenders.  Measures in the Bill are gender neutral and include: ·	Making breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence ·	Giving cohabiting same sex couples the same access to non-molestation and occupational orders as heterosexual couples ·	Making couples who have never cohabited or been married eligible for non-molestation and occupational orders ·	Issuing guidance on the setting up and conduct of domestic violence homicide reviews ·	Making common assault an arrestable offence ·	Enabling courts to impose restraining orders when sentencing for any offence ·	Enabling courts to impose restraining orders on acquittal for any offence ·	Giving any person mentioned in a restraining order a right to make representations in court if an application is made to vary or terminate the order I hope this demonstrates the Government's commitment to tackling domestic violence and ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable.  Yours sincerely,   S**** O*****.
