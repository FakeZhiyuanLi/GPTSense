      ok im 13 (almost anyway) and i made 2 stories already but the second one isnt finished yet im just in chapter 3. Let me tell you sum of the story anyway. Ok its about this girl her name is Tammy who lost her best best best friend which is her twin brother. His name is ross and ross died from lung cancer. Tammy is very upset and mad and everythin and her other best friend Lynn and Travis helps her to find her way back to the light. They were also crushed but not like Tammy. But now her parents are constantly fighting and thinking of getting a divorce. To avoid more sadness her parents sent her to rome to be with her brother and sister(Tommy and Karen). Then she meets this really cool guy who looks exactly like her brother named Antonio. but now Travis is jealous and Lynn is mad because she didnt spend much time with her and Travis thinks Tammy likes Anton because he looks like Ross and she doesnt truly like him. Tammy was all angry then she founds out Anton was cheating on her and Travis was right and she felt sick and fainted and went into a coma. I wont tell you anything about the end:p

      Exams were not at all very very extremely hard. Math was hard and english was easy all that. ~~~~~~FFFFFFIIIIIIINNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLZZZZZZzz~~~~~~ They are driving me super crazy and all. Tomorow is my best friend's birthday and on thursday (where i am its a weekend) have to go to school for my last final its for social studies. I bet it'll be okay i guess. Tapi ya untungnya aku uda dapet kado buat bff aku tapi ngasih nya kapan ya. Bentar lagi pergi balik ke indo and bahasa indo ku agak gimana ya rusak or sunthin like that. Nanti pasti deh aku kangen ma temen teman aku kaya mm lia, windhi and icha bff aku nanti ketemu lagi gak ya. Aku tak tau sih tapi kalau kangen ma ehm ehm ill kill my self or do sumthin freaky. BTW back in english in my school there is this cool guy his name is anas. Aduh aku gebetan banget ma dia gak begitu cakep sih but he doesnt even know im alive!!!!!!!!!!

      What i think of my achivement.....i dunno. I never achived anything. My highest goal is not even as close as the peak of a mountain. At school mmm my science project one a prize in the sixth grade. Its not worth taking a real big risk if you dont get rewarded. Ok so i achived in more important things like life. I have great friends i love all of them thats the only thing im good at. Anyway guess theres no point in moaning. As they say if it aint broken dont fix it.
