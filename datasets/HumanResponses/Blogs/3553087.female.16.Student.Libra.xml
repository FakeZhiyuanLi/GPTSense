      that has nothing to do with anything, but its true, nontheless. thats a three part word..i wonder if there are four part words. i'm such a lonely little person..i sit in the same place everyday...staring at the ceiling, listening to the same songs, hoping that someone will come visit. but they rarely ever do. because everyone hates me. and im a sad little person. *sigh* im really not that bad at all...i can be really nice. i just wish i had more true friends. more close friends. because it gets hard to talk to dwayne and other guys about stuff that i really dont wanna talk to them about. and sophia..shes a close friend, but sometimes she can be close minded and too judgemental. my family, they dont care how i feel. and my other friends..well they probably think im all happy and stuff. i just wish i could find someone just like me who i could chill with and talk to about everything. a girl just like me. somebody to be my BEST friend. because having a guy as a best friends does have its disadvantages...i cant really talk about boys to him without him getting jealous. and dwayne can be a real peice of shit sometimes anyway. i truly hate him at times. but i guess i owe him something..i dunno. i dont even know what the hell im talking about right now....i ramble too much. i think i should see a therapist or something...but that would make me seem like a total pussy. just another whining bitch. and i dont wanna be that. id rather hold my on then bother some stranger with my issues. but sometimes things, they get hard to hold on the inside. it starts feeling harder to breathe. or at least it does for me.

      late night and im bored...what to do? nothing to do. i was all depressed earlier. my mom was nagging me about some stupid shit and it just triggered some other stuff thats been bothering me lately. i like Lee and everything but i dont think its gonna work out...i think i might tell him that when i see him. i just dont want a relationship right now because i cant have one with anyone i want. right now theres really on three people im interested in..and well, the chances of getting any of them are slim. and if i did, i couldnt hold them for long. the first one...well...i wont even go there. the second one, i've known him for like two years and i've always thought he was cute since i met him. i know he really likes me to. but it wouldnt work out because he has a long term g/f, some of his family members/friends dont like me, and i've dated some of his friends. but still i feel hes one of my favorite friends because hes always there to listen and make me laugh and he isnt two faced like a lot of people. he always stands up for me. he even has a scar on his face for me. the third person...well hes the major one. i mean he was the only guy to ever really give a damn about me in that way. i loved him a lot but i took him for granted and ignored him and fucked up big time. lets just say he wasnt as "hasty" as i like my guys and that i wasnt as patient as he likes his girls. but now i doubt he'll ever give me a chance to really prove myself because 1. i've messed around with his friends (not messing around as in fucking, btw. more like 'talking to') and 2. i got in an arguement with his sister and now she hates me. he probably does to. its sad though because id never felt for a guy what i felt for him. sometimes i wonder if the dreams i had of him and i being happy together will ever come true. probably not. shits fucked up. sometimes..i wish i was full out GAY. then i wouldnt have to deal with guys or emotions for them at all. i think id be happier if i liked girls, but its hard for me to be attracted to them sometimes. of course i dont have anything against homo or bisexuality, but i dunno sometimes it does seem a little weird. i mean the only REALLY pretty girls i see are on the movies and even then its hard for me to look at them that way. but i think that if i ever did get in a relationship with a chick, i would be happy, because it wouldnt be so much stress and she would know how i feel more of the time. *sigh* maybe i'll do that in college. or maybe i'll just have a threesome....knowing my luck i'd feel left out. : /

      so i wrote a poem. kind of long though. ============================================================ Angel eyes, why dont you walk over here, and grace me with your presence? instead of making me stare. im near sighted, ya know. Angel eyes, why dont you sit on down? make my life worth living, just for today. say a few words, even if you dont want. humor me, pity me, let me feel some fake love. since thats all you have to offer, for this girl that adores the space you occupy. exspecialy when its beside her.. Angel eyes, touch me anywhere! even if its only for a second.. let me feel that electricity let me pretend whats fake is real, and pretend i didn't notice. Angel eyes, would you fall for a girl like me? of course you wouldnt. but i fell for you. and i hit the bottom so hard that i swallowed my pride and when i stood up i was dizzy and weak. things became blurs. love is blind. Angel eyes, lead me of through your circle of seduction because even though that little path wont get us anywhere...id follow you everywhere like a lost puppy who fell in love. i dont mean to be cliched, but.. Angel eyes, i'll do whatever you want, but i'll never ask for your love. because i already know the answer and my eyes could never stay dry, and my mind would reject the rejection. Angel eyes, you have a wonderful mind and a beautiful body.. but a terrible heart. you make me feel low i remember once upon a time..you made me want to be better. now i just wish i was different. ====================================================================================  dwayne said that was a cute little poem. i think it was to. not the best i've written but worthy of something, nonetheless.

      thats a question with a point. we all go through our insignificant mediocre lives only thinking of ourselves and looking out for others only when it serves us some benifit. does charity even really exist? i dont beleive i can ever recall anyone ever doing something for someone else, and not for themselves. and sometimes...its subtle, but its always there. even people who donate to charity, or give homeless people money, the only reason they really do it is to appear like a good person or to make themselves feel good by being "generous and selfless". theres no such thing as selflessness. everything is based on selfishness.  well lets see...havnt been online for a few days. been over at my dads. i swear id rather die then do somethings. i havnt talked to lee since like thursday. he ussualy calls me on my cell but its not working right now and i would call him but he doesnt have a phone at his house yet. sucks. i just wanna see what the deal is with him. im fuckin tired right now...gonna go lay down down down.  read the lyrics to this song "if it were up to me" by rooney. i wish someone cared that much about me to write a song like that. its the sweetest thing i've ever heard.

      I'm Gonna fight 'em Off A Seven Nation Army couldn't hold me back They're Gonna Rip it off Taking there Time right behind my back  And I'm Talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette  And the message coming from my eye says leave it alone  Don't want to hear about it Every single one's got a story to tell Everyone Knows about it From the Queen of England To the Hounds of Hell  And if I catch ya commin back my way I'm gonna Serve it to you And that ain't what you want to hear but that's what I'll do  And the feelin' commin from my bones says find a home  I'm goin' to Witchita Far from this opera for evermore I'm gonna work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore  And I'm Bleedin, and I'm Bleeding, and I'm Bleedin, Right before the Lord All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will sing no more  And the stings commin from my blood tell me go back home  white stripes/seven nation army/elephant ---------------------------------------------- if someone ever told me to pick a theme song for myself, or a song that describes how i feel about things in general, then that would be it. that song is hardcore. i exspecially like the part when hes like "i'm goin to Witchita, far from this opera for evermore." i totally feel that. i getting sick of laurinburg. but i'll only have to put up with it for a little while longer. this bitch juanita told me that lee was talkin shit about me or something..next time he calls im gonna be upfront and ask him if he was. if he says yeah then i am so done with guys. i mean i am REALLY done with them. as a matter of fact, i HOPE he has been talking shit because truth be told, personally, i dont even like guys anymore. nope. they're boring and repetitive. all the same. and i dont even get turned on by these assholes anymore...maybe its stupid to be saying this on the internet, but i havnt had any sex drive whatsoever within the last several months. sex is fucking boring. and the guys arnt hot anymore.i mean yeah i still think a lot of guys are cute but they just dont do it for me anymore. fuckin tom cruise could walk in here naked right now and i wouldnt feel anything at all. of course id still do him..just to brag. heh. thats all for now.

      "i know you see me on the video..(true) i know you hear me on the radio (true) but you still don't pay me no attention! listenin to what your stupid friends mention. "shes a slut shes a ho shes a freak. got a different dude every day of the week." its cool..not tryin to put a rush on you. i just gotta let you know that i gotta crush on you."  i've had that song on my mind all day. well..nothing to write about. guess i'll just be corny and write about my feelings and whats on my mind. dont you hate it how sometimes you want something/someone so badly, but there is absolutly nothing you can do to get that person/thing? i hate that. it seems as if there should be some type of option. but in some cases their is no option..you just cant have the person as hard as you try, or as much as you adore them, or as much as you wish for it. you could tell the person that you're madle in love with them and that they mean the world to you, but you know that it would do no good and would probably make the person feel guilty and uncomfortable, which is the last thing you want. true love sucks like that. i dont think anyone has ever loved me in a romantic way, even the guys that i was in love with. i guess i have some flaw, or maybe its the guys that i chose to date? i dont know..doesnt matter. because with them i always did have a chance..a chance to MAKE them love me, because it was a possibility with them. but like i said, its hard when you love someone more than you've ever loved anyone and you cant even tell them like you mean it and like you want to because you know that that rejection would only shatter your heart. i dunno..just running off at the mouth again.

      i wish i was intoxicated right about now..that'd be nice. the happiest day of my life is gonna be when one of my older friends turns twenty one and can buy whenever they want. somebody better save me cause i'm gonna drown..lol. man i wish there wasn't an age limit on buying stuff like liquor. i mean a twenty one year old can get drunk and fuck something up in the same way that a seventeen year old could. i think that should be the age limit. 17. the government should also go ahead and legalize marijuana. then they can tax it like they did to alchohol. but hey then at least it'd be more available and nonillegal. pot isnt really that fun anymore anyway. its boring..its the same old thing everytime. everytime i do i always tell myself that i'm never going to again, but i guess boredom gets the best of me. i don't really like it when people smoke a lot..like everyday. then again i hate it when someone thinks they're better than everyone that smokes just because they don't. thats not always true. but drugs are bad. laurinburg has become like fucking coke central..its sad. theres people i've known for a long time who i would have never exspected they would be hooked on something like that, but surprise surprise. my own opinion, hard drugs are bad and shouldn't be done that often. MAYBE once in a while, but thats only if you can handle it without getting out of control. thats what i think.  anyway, my mom said phil and matt cambpell came over here three times looking for me this morning while i was asleep. then they came back after i woke up asking if i knew where to get a blunt. lame. but they hung over here for a while, then went to peters. brian and that chick amy came over there and she was fuckin starin hard like she never saw a black person before. ever since i met her shes always looked at me like that. you know how ussualy when you catch somebody staring at you they turn the other way? not her. she does the same thing every time..she looks at my shoes and then slowly makes her way up to my face and just fucking stares like she wants to fight or something. at least i hope thats what she wants. i mean believe me, i'm pretty much trysexual but theres no chance in hell i'd give her more than a second glance. she looks too awkward and bony. and her face looks like a horse or something. i dunno its weird. anyway..raber asked me if i had been talking shit about him cause he heard i was but i was like no cause he was my ride home and besides he gave me some icecream. lol. i still will never like that guy tho. he can't be trusted...two faced. maybe someday i'll tell him. but does that also make me two faced for acting like his friend when im around him, but talking shit behind his back? im a hypocrit. oh well..he started it.  at the end of this week im going to my dad's and im staying there for like a week. that should be cool.

      I don't want to get over you I guess I could take a sleeping pill and sleep at will and not have to go through what I go through I guess I should take Prozac, right,? and just smile all night at somebody new Somebody not too bright, but sweet and kind who would try to get you off my mind. Oh..I could leave this agony behind which is just what I'd do if I wanted to                     but I don't want to get over you cause I don't want to get over love I could listen to my therapist, pretend you don't exist, and not have to dream of what I dream of I could listen to all my friends and go out again and pretend it's enough or I could make a career of being blue I could dress in black and read Camus smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth like I was 17 that would be a scream but I don't want to get over you             -i don't want to get over you --------------------------------------------------------------------  Don't fall in love with me yet We only recently met True I'm in love with you but you might decide I'm a nut Give me a week or two to go absolutely cuckoo then, when you see your error, then, you can flee in terror like everybody else does I only tell you this cause I'm easy to get rid of but not if you fall in love Know now that I'm on the make and if you make a mistake my heart will certainly break I'll have to jump in a lake and all my friends will blame you There's no telling what they'll do It's only fair to tell you I'm absolutely cuckoo             - absolutely cuckoo

      when i have a kid, if its a guy, i should name him Tupac. that would be cool. but he would get picked on too much so i guess it wouldn't be a good idea. i wanna have a lot of kids. 4 or 5 sons and one daughter..who would be my youngest. i gotta leave something behind after im long gone lol, might as well be kids. i think i'll name my kids Jim (after jimmy page), Jarod (pronounced juh-rod), Mark, Leroy, and Luke. my little girl would be either Monica or my middle name Tanise. probably monica though..i think thats a pretty name. i really hope none of my kids come out retarded. i hope im not infertile or anything either..lol...those kinds of things scare me sometimes. i think that whenever i get my own family my kids will be the most happiness to ever come into my life. i have other aspirations but my main one has always been to one day be a really good mom. theres just something about that, it would make me really happy. oh thats so sappy....lol.  micheal jackson used to be the man back in the day. i was listening to that song the other day..'smooth criminal'. "he came in thru the window, and it sounded like a crescendo. he came into her apartment, he left blood stains on the carpet. annie are you ok? are you ok? are you ok annie?" haha. that song is the bomb diggidy. thats some old slang right there for ya.."bomb diggidy". lol  i went to lees today for a while. that guy mcbride showed up with this chick name emily, his girl i think. shes mad cool. what else did i do today...oh yeah..nothing. ha. somebody called me once on my home phone and twice on my cell this morning and afternoon. everytime i answered the person wouldn'y say shit...they just sat/stood there or whatever. i think i know who it was tho. the number that called my home phone and cell was a cellphone number. i called it back earlier tonight to see if i would recognize the person's voice and it sounded just like fuckin tracy. as a matter of fact i know thats who it was. i know she would'nt call me and hang up but i put two and two together and figured who it was. the other number that called my cell and didn't say shit was campbell's. and i know he wouldn't just call and not say anything. so once again i know who THAT was. immaturity. these people have never heard of caller id..

      back that thang up! i downloaded 'intoxicated' by this band the stryder earlier. its a good song/band. very beautiful lyrics. i was listening to this song by the darkness last night called 'love is only a feeling'. i havn't cried in a long time but i did kinda last night when i was listening to it. i don't know why though. its just so deep, i can relate to it completely.   on another note..i hate confrontation. exspecialy when im sort of too blame for directly starting it. basically early this day (like 4;30 this morning) i saw juanita was online so we started arguing or whatever. me and her have never really had a problem, its just that whole morgan thing. then morgan got online and we started talking trash to. so then i got off but i started to feel guilty for being so childish with juanita just because her friend and i dont get along. i mean she is one of my closest friend's sister and i don't want our friendship to be affected by anything like that. but anyway i felt pretty bad so i got back on later to apologize,she wasnt on, roxy was tho and she was all like "i dont appreciate some of the things you've said about me *like i've ever said anything really bad..* but i admitt i've said stuff about you and im sorry about that. lets stop all the confrontation blah blah..". but we talked about it and we're cool.we both agree that its pretty stupid to not like other people just because of who they associate with. we both also agreed that morgan and i will probably never get along again. every time i ask her to specifically state why she stopped being cool with me and start hating me over kevin shes like "its not about him, its about you being an asshole to me. you're close minded, stuck up, shallow, insincere, blah blah.." i mean i've even apologized to her before but she won't let go of whatever it is she hates about me. oh well. i got 99 problems and im GLAD that a bitch aint one..

      I'm wasting time thinking about a girl And stealing her away from her world She and I would run away I think of all the things that I'd say We'd talk about important things And I picture it in my dreams Maybe I'd impress her By being in a band and Maybe if I act real cool She'd let me hold her hand and Maybe I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am I just wasting my time Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's When I made fun of that guy Remebering the look she gave me When I told her that I used to fry I really want to ask her out But my ego could never take it And in my town you can't drive naked And maybe I'd impress her By being in a band and Maybe if I act real cool She'd let me hold her hand and Maybe I'll win her heart By writing this song about her Sometimes I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am I just wasting my time Am I just wasting my time Am I just wasting my time Am I just wasting my time Wasting my time thinking about a girl  -blink/wasting time   i like that song.

      so why am i sitting here writing this? because i have a boring life, thats why. but..i didn't come to whine. :) somehow that reminds me of how much i hate these little 10/11 year old internet freaks with screennames with things like "69" and "hotNsexy" and stuff in it. thats annoying. and these same people always find it terribly amusing to replace the word "come" with "cum". whats the deal with that? i dont know...immaturity i suppose. but i know people who have graduated who say things like that. lol. anyway i probably won't write in this thing anymore today. it seems everytime i do there is less and less to say. im so illiterate. anyway, i went to lee's today and we watched that lame movie "Radio" or something. that movie is a joke..seems like it should be on PBS or something. but thats alright cause i was w/lee and hes so adorable! for the first time i've met a guy who is as pretty as he thinks he is. ha. he. hi. ho. hu. hy. is 'y' a vowel? the world may never know..  almost forgot i had to pee. i'm such a smarty.

      i dont even have anything to write about right now. im just super bored doing nothing so i'll make up something to write. man, i cant wait until i move out. i'll go to someplace where i can play music as loud as i want and not be interrupted. if i go to a university after HS then i want it to be in Cali. dwayne says that its just like might to want to live in an overly liberal place like that. hes lived in L.A most of his life so he knows how it is there, hes told me lots about it. i'd love to live in L.A. actually, anywhere is better than here, little redneck laurinburg. *sigh*..i've ran out of things to do.

      does that turn you on? no? oh. listening to 'pool shark' right now. my favortie line in that song is the 'my baby likes to shoot pool, i like lying naked in my bedroom.' i think thats pretty funny. well well well...whats new with me..oh yeah. from this day forward, i am NEVER gonna smoke anything EVER again. okay..thats probably a lie...but its true that i am at least going to TRY to never smoke anything again. that includes cigarettes, which will be the hardest to quit. i probably wont last the day, but oh well, i'll try. i dont wanna grow up and have cancer or any other problems. i wonder if you can get cancer from drinking..i dont really care tho. no way im gonna give that up. but everything else, weed, cigarettes, otherwise, all gone. i mean i already know im a loser, but i dont wanna go to the next level and become and even bigger loser because of drugs or something like that. people around here are fucked up....i dont wanna be like that. okay so anyway..enoguh of that. i hope lee comes and sees me today. that would be cool. i might be going back to my dad's in a little while tho. well, im outtie.

For advice of the soul, it's wise to use vicars. For advice of the body, a doctor is quicker. For advice of the heart, or when lads start to snicker; it's best to first check, if your skirt shows your knickers!" thought that was pretty funny. hehe

      yep. hopefully i'll be getting some skeet action sometime soon. ;) lol but enough of that. just got back from my dad's place like an hour ago. stayed there for like three days, it was alright. i didnt even see my dad tho, he wasnt there the whole time. oh well no skin off of anything of mine. my stepmom is hardly ever there so basically it was like a three night party. i got some good news...im gonna be a aunt! my brother got his girl pregnant and shes due in four months. even tho they are both only fifteen both sets of parents support them and i think they'll do well. makes me wanna have a kid. i really do want one, but i know that i should wait a couple of years if i dont wanna make life any more miserable. hehe. i love going to my dads. my step mom lets us take the car whenever we want and shes hardly ever there. when she is all she does is sleep. incase you didnt know, my brothers are 14 and 15 and my sister is 17. its all consecutive baby. lol. got a new boyfriend to. lee mack. perhaps he'll be better than some of my other ones were. hes a nice guy tho and a fuckin DIME PEICE so hey im pretty happy about that, hehe. i think its about time i dated a black guy anyway. i havnt in so long. im not racist or anything like that but i think the white guy thing was just a fetish or something, i dunno. they just seem all the same, once you've had one, you've had them all. not to say i would never date another one tho. some of them are pretty cool. well, dont know what i'll do now. raining outside. think i'll call somebody.

      thats a line from wendy clear, a song by blink. i wouldnt say they're my favorite band but they're up there. so..what did i do today. my stupid cousin Al almost got me in trouble for lying to my mom about me. i told her i was goin to ronn's house today but i guess she forgot and she asked Al if he had seen me today (cause hes always outside and sees me everytime i leave the house) and he thought i just left without asking her so he told her no, he didnt see me. he had good intentions but just at a bad time. so i went over there and watched mad t/v with him and liz for a while. then liz had to go to matt jones and cut his hair (?) so i went to chris patterson's with dwight. then i came home and went to my grandmas house for a while. i always like going over there, its quiet and not a lot of noise. very relaxing. i guess i wont mind moving to south carolina, i just kinda wanna keep going to SHS. i know a lot of people in south carolina cause of my brothers and sisters, but all my real friends live in lbg. speaking of that, im going to my dad's house tommorow, probably stay for a week or so. my dad gets on my nerves so bad, i swear. all he does is lie. but i wanna see my sister and brothers and my stepmom so i'll go anyway. and besides its kinda cool cause they let me do almost whatever i want without asking questions. lol. well theres this guy, and i like him, and i think he likes me to. hes cute. im not gonna tell him though. or say his name. lol. its amazing how one day i can hate the entire male population and the next day be like "well maybe hes different." lol im smart enough to keep my distance tho. well i guess i'll go play a game now or something.

      tehe. just woke up. my mom and little sister and stepdad were making all this unneccesary noise yet they didnt even ask me if i wanted to go with them to whereever they're going. amazing. what a loving family...i woke up and my eyes feel like pure crap. feels like im asian or something. i can hardly open them and i majorly need some clear eyes or something. i dunno. i gotta get out of this house. like at this second. lol. i'll probably go to liz house today maybe we'll go to matt jones' or something. liz is such a pimp. shes got a husband, a boyfriend, and other guys shes 'talkin' to. except when i say talkin i dont actually mean talkin. lol. me her and matt are gonna have a threesome. except not really because im much too shy for that. : ) well...time for waffles, cause i loves me some waffles.

      thats what im listening to right now. dysentery gary to be exact. well well well..what to say. i was terribly pissed earlier tonight. all i felt was saddness, betrayal, hate, and rage. mostly rage. but i've had time to think about it and im alright now. had a long long talk with dwight and while pulling me out of my own self pity, he brought it too my attention that i dont need some guy to be happy or feel good about myself. see, i realize, as i have for a long time, that'll i'll probably never find anyone that will truly like me in more than a friendly way, and have good intentions. some people just arnt meant to be with anyone. so instead of denying that over and over again by talking to guys, i'll just do the right thing and embrace it. there are plenty of people who go their whole lives without any relationships at all and are perfectly fine with it. as long as i've got my friends, i dont need some stress case to call a boyfriend. the reason im saying all this is because i recently found out that yet another male has bullshitted me. im really used to this by now, so normally it wouldnt bother me, but this particular one went out of his way to assure me that he wasnt like all the former dipshits in my life. turns out he is. but i honestly cant be mad at him. it isnt his fault hes a guy. guys have to lie. thats what they do. lie and decieve. i really do forgive him though because i hate to hold a grudge. but i am mad at myself for 1. trusting a male and 2. putting him before a true friend of mine. that was a shitty thing for me to do. my apologizes to that friend. well i might as well take a vow of celibacy cause im never "talking" to a guy again..(oh yeah thats right..he said we wernt 'talking'. its amazing how people lie..) anyway i got some good news. my little sister told me tonight that mom told her we're gonna be moving. i dont know why my mother didnt tell me this first..maybe a surprise? but apparently we're getting a house built in McColl and they already have the plans for it and everything. i have no idea how long it takes to build a house. i'll ask my mom about it in the morning. i really hope we move over this summer cause im getting tired of laurinburg and all these LYING bastards. haha. yeah i'll be gone...and life will be good, for the first time. :) me and dwight were watching ren and stimpy tonight. they were classic nickelodeon and mtv episodes not any of that fake spike teevee crap. yeah it was funny. well me and ronn and liz and dwight are gonna go to the beach later this week. that should be fun. tired now..gonna sleep. goodnight, reader.      oh yeah and cj...if you were gonna do all that shit then you coulda just went ahead and hooked me up with Lee. im not mad at you or anything but i still really dont understand. ??? : /

      i swear to god, i dont even know what to do about things anymore. now i really understand the meaning behind that phrase "this is the last straw". see, i just found out another guy was bullshittin me and if he was the only one to ever do this, then i would just shrug it off with no problem, but thats not the case. ever guy i've known has done me this way. i swear i dont even have the patience to feel sadness, all i feel is rage right about now. its ridiculous! im tired of boys in general.  i've always tried to do them right, be good and honest and truthful to them, never cheat, listen to them, spend my time on em, everything. all i've ever got in return is excuses, lies, and disapointment. every 'relationship' i've had was based on a fucking lie and i ended up getting used or dumped or cheated on or manipulater when i never deserved it. i dont even cry anymore...its sad really that im used to this kind of treatment. all i feel for these evil creatures is hate right about now. the next guy that does me wrong, will be CUT. so thats why im giving up on these bastards forever, because none of them will ever truley like me and i dont wanna have to hurt one and go to jail. as a matter of fact i dont wanna have anything to do with any dick holder for a long time. all i feel right now is pure rage and if someone was here right now, they would get slapped several times. you think you can trust someone..they even go outta their way to assure you that they arnt like the other fuckers in your life, and you only come to find out that they lied to your stupid dumb ass. thats what i am for ever feeling anything towards any of these bastards. fuck all this shit right now. im taking a vow of celibacy.

      okay so burger kind is having this sale where you buy a chicken sandwhich and get one free so i got it and i just ate one of them and now i feel like crap i wanna throw up. it tasted good but i dunno im just sick now. i wonder if amy made it. i dont even know if she still works there. i hope she didnt tho. no telling where her hands been. probably in peters ass (the most disgusting place on earth). theres probably so much coke under her fingernails...thats just unsanitary to have someone like that working in a fast food place. gross. anyway i dont know who made the sandwhich but im sick. it had way too much mayonaise. i should sue. people sue for the dumbest things. i read on the news the other day some fatass sued a cab company cause she couldnt fit in the car. hilarious/sad. i should probably chill now. maybe lay down.

      and its a mutal feeling. why do i always feel like such shit? maybe its cause thats how people treat me. like a peice of shit, devoid of emotions and incapable of retaliation. i hate to whine but oh well, might as well do it here than in somebody's ear. its just that nothing is ever fucking fair in my life. everytime it finaly seems like something good has come my way, either something stupid/bad happens because god loves to torture me, or it SeEMS to me as if something bad has happened so i just get hit by these uncontrolable fits of sadness and doubt and guilt. i wanna get into a fist fight with jesus. even if it killed me, it'd still be better than feeling how i do sometimes. the smashing pumpkins said it best..'the world is a vampire, sent to drain...despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage.' blah. i think i'll go listen to that song now while i try to hold back the tears. wow....im a wimp. way too emotional.

      i really need to stop smoking cigarettes. exspecialy menthols. im starting to feel the effects of it. been having a lot of heart trouble and i noticed my breathing is getting more shallow. i dont wanna have to regret it 10 years from now when somethings wrong with me like cancer or some kinda disease so i'll stop now. but its HARD! i think i'll take it in steps, first, i wont buy anymore. second, i wont smoke at home anymore. that should cut me back like 3 or 4 a day. i'll only bum off of people when im around them, and even then, i wont take more than two. then after a while maybe i'll just feel like stopping completely. i hope so. right now im listening to another one bites the dust by queen. one of my favorite songs. todays friday, so tommorows the weekend. hmm..this week went by fast. i hope the whole summer goes by like that. the faster next semester gets here, the faster its over and that'll mean i only have one more to go, which is great. yep. great. i need to figure out what i wanna do after high school. cause right now i really dont know. i guess i wouldnt mind going to a four year school but it just seems like a whole lotta hassle. i dont wanna take the SAT. and i kinda wanna stay in lbg for a while anyway. at least i know people here, and im pretty shy to meeting new people who i dont have any mutual friends with. if i do go to a four year school tho, then my first choice would be coastal carolina. its by myrtle beach and i think thats cool. hmm...i dont think im really ready in any way to be a senior. im too young to be in 05 anyway, im supposed to be in 06. i dunno. guess i'll deal with it.

      so its thundering outside. i honestly hope that lightning strikes me. that would be quite an experience. i had this science teacher in middle school who has been struck by lightning twice. hes awesome and superior because of that. on a completly random note, i don't believe in gravity, never have. and i was thinking of something today..lets say that a hole was drilled from one side of the earth to the other, straight through. lets say that an object was dropped through the hole. what would it do when it got to the other end? i know there are some factors to take into considerating like the fact that the center of the earth would melt the object, but put that aside. hypothetically,what would the object do when it got to the other side? would it keep going until it got into outer space? of course not, thats ridiculous. the theory of gravity says that it would stay in that one passage way forever, because when it got to the other side, gravity would just pull it back down again. bullshit, that goes against common sense. what goes up must come down. but if the object was to fall back thru the tunnel, then what factor would determine at what point "gravity" would "decide" to turn the object and its own force around. i think everything they teach in school is a hoax and bullshit. my kids will be homeschooled. lol. you know what song i like? 'roses' by outcast. that whole album is good. buy it if you havnt already. i wonder what my horoscope says today..i havnt read mine in months. i'll read it later.

      i saw that movie this morning. it was really funny. i think i spend too much time watching movies tho..dont wanna become like matt martin. hehe. man my mom complains too much about little things. its annoying. went to ronn and liz's house today for a while. elizabeth is still like my fucking idol, man. shes always been like the coolest person i've known. she kicked my ass bad in mario, i respect that. lol. and shes a player to. i once aspired to be like her hehe. i havnt hung out with tim and sophia in like 2 weeks. maybe i'll call later and see whats up wit goin to a movie or somethin. seems like most of my friends are out of school already. i only have a few friends in 05. i don't really like my class a lot, just a bunch of stupid immature idiots. its rare that i find somebody cool thats in my grade. went and saw cj today for a little bit. damn getting a job in this town is hard as fuck for me. i think i'll just give up. tired of putting in applications to these shitty redneck places. god i hate rednecks. i'll get a job next semester i guess...i hope my mom doesnt kick me out. really wouldnt have anywhere to put me tho since my dad don't want me around. my family sucks, most of the time. oh well. bout to go to mcdonalds. oh joy. : /

      ever heard that expession "one persons trash is another ones treasure."? heed those words. dont get bitchy when someone picks up something you threw away. exspecialy since you didn't want it...hmm...maybe i shouldnt be saying that. i wish someone were online right now. cjs idle so thats no help. i wanna talk to somebody. sometimes, i dont know what to think about things. its like im kept in the dark and never know how other people really feel and what their motives really are until im hurt or sad. such a depressing world..seems as if nothing is good and true, or that good things are rare to come by. so how can it be, that when you find something that makes you feel good and really is true, that it could possibly be bad? the world is backwards like that. ew..theres a bug in my room. my lil sister is scared. im not really afraid thought because really, its only a bug and its not gonna bite : ) i wish she would sleep tho. its almost 4 AM and im ussualy up by myself this early/late. hmm...i wonder if theres really a god. never been a strong believer in religion, although i think islam is pretty cool. hehe. but about the god thing..i dunno just seems a little imaginative to me. but, guess its all about faith. used to be a hardcore atheist always trying to convince people that it/(s)he doesnt exist but i dunno, i figure that there has to be something more than coincidence and chance that is making my life miserable. so perhaps there is a god, its complete justice is just questionable. ehh...im goin to hell. (i'll take popcorn) : /

      i've always put other peoples feelings before my own happiness. i say that with no ego. sometimes i wonder if thats the right thing to do. to sacrifice your happiness just for someone else to be totaly comfortable. i guess i've always been scared of offending others in some way, and that makes me vunerable. i guess it makes me easy to take advantage of to. but i think i should stop that and just do what my heart tells me. so i think that from now on, i'll just do what the heart tells me and not be concerned so much with what others think. but sometimes it makes me feel selfish. ehh. :-/ anyway, i watched that movie "you got served" today, and i must say, it was a lot better than i expected. makes me wanna dance. i wish i could break dance. that would be awesome. i saw some of "magnolia" yesterday. i guess its depressing in a way but i found parts of it pretty funny. like the first part when that black lady was givin that cop hell. that was hilarious. yep, hilarious. i wish more things were hilarious, instead of being the exact opposite. ugh, dont know what im talking about anymore. post more later.

      okay, not to say that im smarter than einstein or anything, but i dont agree with his theory on time travel. what he says basically, is that the future is predetermined, and if humans could make a machine that could travel faster than light, than traveling into the past would be possible. well i think its bullshit. lets assume that the future is predetermined. at some point in time, what we call the "past" was once "the future". therefore, if its predetermined and unchangable, then how could we possibly interfere by traveling back into time? try to stay with me. thats the first way that time travel is impossible. the second way is, WHY would anyone ever go back in time anyway? lets say you wanted to go back and prevent kennedy from being assinated. lets say that you succeeded and that he was never assininated (thanks to you). if thats the case, then technically, kennedy was NEVER assinated, therefore you would have no reason to go back in time for that reason. god im a genius. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why im more of a genius, than the epitome of genius himself, einstein. blah.

      some fag down the street was just talkin shit. im gonna tear him a new asshole to get fucked in. in a lighter note i just learned that smith got his day ruined by some black guy that beat his ass. funny stuff. but karmas a bitch cause my day has also been ruined. dont wanna talk about it tho. lets just say i didnt get any. and i probably never will, sad to say. sometimes you find a person thats so right for you but they wont give you a decent chance because your life is a waste of space and your luck is shitty. story of my life. so you basically have two options, you can whine and bitch and keep trying over and over again. or you can eat a fucking cookie and move on. i think i'll choose the latter. im gonna go get that cookie now..

FUCK THE BULLSHIT. haha. all i have to say about it..is captured up there in that song.

OH i had the most AWESOME dream like two nights ago. it was great. lol

      Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me I don't know they somehow saved me And I know I'm making something out of this life they called nothing I take what I want Take what I need You say it's wrong but it's right for me I won't look down Won't say I'm sorry I know that only God can judge me  And if I make it thru today, will tomorrow be the same? Am I just running in place? If I stumble and I fall Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same  'Cause, I'm young and hopeless I'm lost and I know this I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say I'm troublesome, I've fallen I'm angry at my father It's me against this world and I don't care, I don't care  No one in this industry understands the life I lead When I sing about my past it's not a gimmick not an act These critics and these trust fund kids Try to tell me what punk is but when I see them on the streets they got nothing to say!  And if I make it thru today will tomorrow be the same Am I just running in place? If I stubble and I fall Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same  'Cause, I'm young and hopeless I'm lost and I know this I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say I'm troublesome, I've fallen I'm angry at my father It's me against this world and I don't care, I don't care -----------------------------------------------------------------  ah, good charolotte. the princes of pop punk. despite the former fact, they still have some alright songs. so...im sitting here drinking some water. i was angry earlier cause i have to babysit my little one instead of going to a party that i would have been the life of. i took some painkillers though and now im straight. i really gotta stop doing that every time i get angry..im gonna die one day. : / OD ON PILLS. eh..its nothing to wave the flag about though. not like perscription pills or anything, i just take like five bayers and a couple of asprin and hope (sometimes) that i don't die. life is depressing anyway. but enough of that talk..life is also short. too short to complain, every chance you get.  something positive....LEE! i wuv him. almost love him. i think i'll love him for sure one day. we've been going together for a month and a day, to this day (like someone cares..lol). hes so much better than a lot of my other boyfriends. he calls everyday, and get this..hes actually, INTERESTING! *gasp* yes folks..he actually intrigues me. hes more than just a pretty face. hes a friend and i can talk to him about like, everything. he listens to. perhaps its just puppy love. but i'll make it into more than that. : ) he asked me the other day, if i was attracted to this certain other guy. to make a long story short, the issue of trust came up, and well..he trusts me. its just me trusting myself thats hard. but i'll try my best.  well kiddies, thats all for now. dont forget to eat your veggies!

      i had a dream about peter last night. it was kinda weird, but made a little sense. in it he got clean and stopped doing drugs and stuff and i was really happy for him. we became best friends again and stuff. but then he met this chick and started dating her and i got super jealous and started harassing them and getting people to turn against them, even thoughi knew they were perfectly happy with each other. then all of a sudden i just started dreaming about the fun i used to have with him and good stuff that happened in the past with us. i think that somewhere deep down, the old pete is still on my mind. i've heard that once you fall in love with someone, you never stop. and even though im not IN love with him anymore, i still care about him and remind myself of back in the day. that was wrong how he did me though..well..i guess how we did each other. dont wanna get into all that though. i just don't see how you wake up one day and decide that you dont love someone anymore...i just cant grasp that. but oh well. its in the past. and its prolly better that way.  well...what will i do today. there was a party last night. i was gonna go but my mom was trippin about some shit so i didnt. next week im going to the beach with lee and his family. that should be fun. well..im outtie for now. my arm is starting to hurt.

      lol..i got this new cd today. 'punk-o-rama", from walmart. its a two disc set. its alright but it has too many new songs and not enough of the old british punk shit that i like. the fuckin clash, bitch! heh. so..whats been up lately..hmm. i found out that peter's not the one who called me a stalker, it was matt stephens. hes really stinky. i wear my gas mask whenever i have to 'stalk' him. : ) what a complete douche. one day hes callin me a stalker and the next hes tellin me he still has feelings for me and stuff..RIGHT. i doubt that bitch can even feel love.  lee was over here today. we watched kill bill together. we were completly fucking broke so we couldnt get high. cj called but he was on his way to work so that was no help. but i had fun with lee, without getting high, and i think thats a good thing. i like him a lot. i take back that shit i said about breaking up with him. hes too nice for that. well next week, we will have had been together for a month. kinda feels like that to. i talked to brandon c. the other day and he said him and roxy have been together for thirteen months...thats a long fucking time. geez i really hope me and lee can last that long, and even longer. that would be so awesome. i've never had a really long relationship like that so that would be really cool. well, time to go find some trouble to get into. im outtie.

FUCK GUYS.
