      i saw a wonderful story from my email...its from my church fren...very meaningful and sweet...here goes...  Lady: Why do you like me..? Why do you  love me?  Man: I can't tell the reason.. but I really like  you..  Lady: You can't even tell me the reason... how  can  you say you like me? How can you say you love  me?  Man: I really don't know the reason, but I can  prove that I love you.  Lady: Proof? No! I want you to tell me the  reason.  My friend's boyfriend can tell her why he loves  her  but not you!  Man: Ok..ok!!! Erm... because you are beautiful,  because your voice is sweet,  because you are caring, because you are loving,  because you are thoughtful, because of your  smile,  because of your every movements..  Unfortunately, a few days later, the Lady met  with  an accident and became comma.  The Guy then placed a letter by her side,  and here is the content:  Dearest,  Because of your sweet voice that I love you...  Now can you talk? No! Therefore I cannot love  you.  Because of your care and concern that I like  you..  Now that you cannot show them, therefore I  cannot love you.  Because of your smile,  because of your every movements that I love  you..  Now can you smile? Now can you move?  No, therefore I cannot love you...  If love needs a reason, like now, there is no  reason  for me to love you anymore.  Do love need a reason? NO!  Therefore, I still love you...  And love doesn't need a reason  QUOTE OF THE WEEK  " The best and most beautiful things in the  world  cannot be seen, not touched..but are felt in  the  heart ."  This is such a wonderful story.. please remember  this.. to all of u out there, u dont need a  reason to love someone..
