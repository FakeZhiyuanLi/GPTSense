      Today I was thinking of my fav celebrities. I mean not only japanese singer. All.  I came to this decicion:   1. Ayumi Hamasaki & Julianne Moore  Ayumi, the greatest singer on earth. Her songs have so much power and I admire her for the point that she's writing her own lyrics. And Julianne Moore. I've NEVER seen such an gorgeous actress like she is. She plays her roles with so much feeling. Gosh, I love this 2 woman.   2. Mika Nakashima  Mika, my dearest Mika :)  She's such an gorgeous singer. When I list my fav singers, she's always on 1st position with Ayumi because her songs are so individual and beautiful.   3. Keanu Reeves & Robbie Williams  Keanu Reeves...yes...I haven't seen much movies with him. First of all I saw "Matrix". I thought he was good looking and playing well in this film but when I saw "Sweet November", I saw a completely different face of him and of his talent. Keanu is great, no matter what. Robbie is  an AMAZING entertainer. He fits well with EVERY form of music. There aren't much of these musicians, they're really rar but Robbie is defentitly one of them. And I think he's hot. He has the little something.  I think that's it. I like a lot of celebs but those are the important one :)  Have I ever listed up my fav movies? oo (I'm in list up mood xD Sorry for that)   1. The Hours  I often mentioned it. It's just an great movie. I can't say why I love this movie...you have to see it yourself. It just kicks as in such a way !   2. The Shipping News  Only a few people know this movie...It's a great pity. This movie is just...wow. I was really impresed of it.   3. HERO  I NEVER saw a movie like that. Wow. I think the story itself of the movie is kinda sketchy but the dialogs and statments are so meaningful. And the beautiful colors. You should all see it !  Hehe :D I could list up more but now I'm tired. I think I'll go to bed soon.

      Dunno really what to write but I had this feeling to write something, even if it's bullshit.  I meet up with my dad yesterday. We drove to the Plus City and he bought himself a pair of trousers. I mean the ones u can use for sport activities. He's now into "Walking" if someone of you knows that. lol. Last summer it was jogging, now walking and he said he's planning to do some cross-country skiing in winter. He wants to abate xD Yeah but anyway, after that he wanted to buy some eatables b/c he was on a tradeshow (he's an exhibitor) and tole me he has nothing in the fridge. So we went to Eurospar. He said I could pick what I want and so I picked some sweets *eats a toffifee* xD"" I'm stupid. I always say I'm to fat and than I buy (or let buy) tons of sweets > Okay after we brought all the stuff to the car, we went to the Megaplex (cinema) to buy the cards for "Traumschiff Suprise ~ Periode 1".  After that we went to Cosmos. I like to grub in the DVD section. Since I haven't found "Far from Heaven" in the Saturn stor in the city, I wanted to look for it in Cosmos. I didn't even have to look for it! It was right on top of the front row. I looked at it but put in down again. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to have a DVD b/c he would buy one for me. I was like "o______O" I knew my dad's really generous but I was sunned :) I told him that I want "Far from heaven" so badly and he bought it for me :D *jumps up and down* Then we walked to the cinema and watched the movie. I watched it the sec. time but I like the film, I really have NO idea why most of the people dislike it ~~" If you don't expect that much or expect an incrase to "Der Schuh des Manitu" it could be funny :)  Today I watched "Far from heaven". GOSH, Julianne Moore plays her part SO well *is stunned* I can understand by she was nominated for the Oscar (you know, when Nicole Kidman won for "The Hours" - best female leading role) but I can't understand why she didn't win... Don't get me wrong. Nicole was absolutely ingenious as Virginia Woolf and I LOVE the whole The Hours movie more than any other movie but I really think that Julies role in "Far from Heaven" was a bit better played. Maybe I say that out of my Julie-Obsessed-(hopfully-not)-phase. BUT if you ask me I would have nominated Julie for her role as Laura Brown in "The Hours". I never heard of Julie before "The Hours" and I was completely stunned by her acting talent when I saw her as Laura Brown. Gosh, she's so great! She would deserve the oscar for that role BUT this fucking oscar jury didn't even gave her the oscar for the best supporting actress (she was nominated for The Hours -> Laura Brown). FUCK YOU ALLLLLLLLLL !!! >  Right now I'm listening to "Kiseki no Umi", the opening song of "Record of Lodoss war" (it is Kiseki no Umi, right Katja?). This song is soooooo beautiful o_____O WOW O.O But it reminds me a bit of this one Vangelis song calls "Adiemus". Don't know why. But it is really beautiful :D  That's all for today. Maybe I'll blog more soon =)

       Hm...didn't write a long time ... But yeah, I haven't had a real reason to discribe my boring days.  I woke up early today. Around 8:00 am. When I got up I felt really confused and tired. Also a little bit ill. But I drove with my mum to Leiner and ... BLAH >        Fuck u right back, world >

           Today was boring...nothing happend, not at all o.O  I slept really long (approx. 11 hours) but I was tired again soon. Don't know why...Am I short of sleep?? I really can't tell ...  Today, Teresa and I wanted to go to the Grottorailway. It's a little drive with a dragon-train and built for kids but it's too expensive. Since I'm over 14, it would cost me 4,40euro and that's too expensive right now.I told Teresa that and she can't afford that as well so we canceled the trip to the Poeslingberg. Maybe another time...  I dunno really know what to write but I'm bored so I want to have a little activity.  Sweetbox is so great O.O *is listening to Human Sacrifice* *adore* MOOOOOORE O____O  I hope my lastest Yesasia Order (MINMI - imagine, Twins - evolution, Chihiro Onitsuka - This Armor) arrives soon, maybe - with a lot of luck - this week but that would be too good to be true. Hope the 25th of August comes soon b/c I preordered Mika Nakashima's new DVD and it will release on this day and as good as I know myself I'll cancel the order more than one time and order again with another cd .... (Ordered Twins - Girlpower to pass the 49$ mark and get free-shipping) And I know I'm going to be concerned about money but I should always keep in mind that my birthday is on 30th of august. If my grandma ask what I want for birthday, I think I ask her if I can have the Mika DVD...One money-sorrow less ;)    I wanna be creative =/ I wanna paint a really beatiful picture, not only expressionless things...Hmpf...that sucks...I love art ...   Today I watched the first 2 episodes of CNN's new show "Amish in th City". It's really interesting if you ask me. 5 or 6 amish people - all around 22 - go to L.A. and live with 5 or 6 people from big cities. When the Amish are around 20 they are allowed to go away from the Amish-live to see - this sounds corny - the world. It's called "Rumspringer". They go to a city and see all those stuff they don't have and than they can decide if they wanna be an Armish for the rest of their life or wanna go away from it but I think that's kind of a hard desicion for them because if they decide to go away from the amish-life they hurt their family and stuff (I don't know much about this group...so please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm exiced what's going to happen in the next few episodes.  Aaaand I watched the two last episodes of "The Simple Life 2". lol, I think the whole show is stupid and senseless but since "Gilmore Girls" ended in June (or July? o_O Don't know exactly...It's been ago too long ...) I had to look for another show and so I thought I could watch The Simple Life xD  Does anyone know "Desperate Housewives"? loooooool, this show is SOOOO great but it's a pitty that there's only one episode :| ... That SUCKS ....    Okay, that's for today...Maybe tomorrow is more interesting than today..I wouldn't mind =/

         Baaaaack O_O  It was AMAZING...once again, this movie showed me how gorgeous Julianne Moore is...and she's such an actress ! *adore* But I love the whole "The Hours" movie. Teresa was stunned, I recoginiced and she said it more than one time. I can absolutely understand her; the film is too amazing to dislike it ! When we got to the cinema, the whole adults were starring at us, wondering what we're going to do here and praying not to sit with us in the same movie... it was uncomfortable and we felt misplaced but after a period of time we didn't care anymore and just had fun. The movie started half an our later than it was written in the programm b/c of a play which was outdoor - and next to the summercinema - as well.  Teresa and I met up at 5:00 pm as I wrote and went around in the city. We decided to go to "Douglas" to test some parfumes b/c we want to paste up our table with those white strips you're spraying the perfumes on lol o_O So we went around and testet and we agree on the smell of Channel No5...it smells like a cloaca *g* Don't know why the people are so crazy about it but not only this one smells REALLY bad oO I doubt I'll EVER buy a Channel perfume ;) I would like to buy this pink gucci parfume or J'adore from Doir. They're great if you ask me xD But anyway, we always have so much fun in there...I think this mixed up odor makes me dizzy O_o lol o_O And Teresa as well *g* The salegirls were starring at us as we just took refug from the madhouse. But hey, as long they don't oder us  to stay away from the shop, we'll come back - for sure :P  I'm going to make some dolls now (Katja, you affixed me ;)) lalala *jumps up and down*  Edit: Just noticed that Ayu's looking    very creasy     on my icon-picture o_O lol   Edit2: Start in the next day wasn't that good as expected ><><>       stomachache      is nearly killing me and I'm so fuckin' tired >  I just canceld the meeting with Teresa today...We planned to go to the Pöstlingberg and go with the Grottorailway (lol, this translation of "Grottenbahn" was written in a touristguide xD)...But yeah, maybe tomorrow or so....*rubs her eyes* >

       Yey, here I am. Just regged my nick to post comments on Katjas entrys but then I thought I could write as well. It's fun =)  Please don't judge on my grammar or writing-style b/c I'm a real blockhead when I'm not writing something in school, if you know what I mean.  The day befor yesterday I ordered some cds on Yesasia. Hope they're shipping it out soon *can't wait anymore* I'm too impatient, one of my biggest faults :/ I wish I could turn it off but I can't find the switch off-button ;)  Today I'm going to the cinema with Teresa. Summer Cinema =D What means that you're sitting outside, whatching a great movie (originallanguage but subtitled) =) The City Kino and Moviemento are working together for this and there's always a gread schedule with non-blockbuster movies. For example "The Hours" (what we're watching 2night ;)), "HERO", "The little chinese Seamstress  " etc etc. I think that's rather cool b/c those movies have a really high level. I like them. For me It's okay to watch movies like "Traumschiff Suprise" b/c they ARE funny and you HAVE to laugh if it's you humour but I prefer dramas like "The Hours", "Dogville" oder "The Shipping News". Yey...I'm going to be a filmfreak, I can say you that o_O  So ... my fist entry, full of nonsense o_O But yeah...I've to go b/c I've to dry my hair, pack my handbag and at 5:00 pm I'm meeting up with Teresa. Cinema starts at 9:00 pm *g* A bit late but we have no choice. It's only playing once =//
