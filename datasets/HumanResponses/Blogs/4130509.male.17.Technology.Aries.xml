       Early this morning I got up and with only 4 hours of sleep, laced up
my shoes, jumped on my bike. Feeling the rush of blood, air and acid
chewing my muscles, I went for what seemed to be a 15 mile sprint (36
minutes). Pushing myself on the last mile, the air burning in my
lungs, I cut onto 155th. A minute later I turned onto the home stretch
my legs burning...and I saw an older man uprooting my "KerryEdwards04"
sign and stepping on it. Like a possessed man grinding the devil into
the dust. Shocked and appalled, I jumped my bike from the bike lane
onto the curb heading straight for him yelling "get the @#^*&amp; off my
sign!" he turned looked at me and bolted to his car...a Honda CRV with a
"veterans against Kerry sign." I stopped next to the sign dismounted
and sat there feeling lost, drunk and depressed.
 
As I sat there feeling sick (no result of the man's antics). My head
unstable on its foundations, my knees like rubber, physically
exhausted, unable to find the ounce of strength needed to project my
anger. As I weakly reached over and picked up the sign, an elderly
lady walking her dog who had witnessed the entire thing, looked at me
and said "that's right put the sign back up, show the bastard". I felt
like all the walkers and joggers on the street were watching me as I
stood up and put the sign back up.
 
I walked into my house, stumbled to the bathroom threw up and realized
that I was not breathing enough air. And threw up some more. The acid
burning in my mouth, covered in sweat, I took a cold shower then
crawled beneath the sheets of my bed for a few more hours of snooze
time.
 
Waking up I was shocked to notice that on the other side of the
driveway from the KerryEdwards04 sign there was a BushCheney04 sign. I
taped a note to my mailbox stating that I did not approve of such a
sign on property that was entrusted to my family and that none of them
are Republicans. And that if they wanted the sign back they could a
call me and I would give it back. They came and picked it up 4 hours
later.
 
The nerve of those that think that they have inherited the earth...no
one taught them to share or respect in kindergarten.
 
Its a crazy world. Now I see why people turn to the bottle.

       So yesterday a dear friend of mine said "I might actually vote for
bush, because kerry raises the chances of a draft." That statement
saddened me to the core. I don't agree with the way that Bush is
pushing our schools to fail. I don't agree with income tax cuts. I
don't agree with the war that he fraudulently pushed us into. But the
argument seemed to be clear amid all of the silence. Its what affects
me now that matters. I don't buy that. I don't care about the now. Its
about rebuilding the future. The things that we deal with in the now
are going to be dismal. They are going to hurt. I want to ensure that
my children don't have to deal with them, I don't want to be involved
in useless wars. I don't want this country to give in to the rich
executives. I don't want to have to go to war for the sake of oil and
Corporate militaries. Oddly enough, the only reason that I am
complacent about the Bush right now is because he isn't DOING ANYTHING
right now; because he is too busy trying to get re-elected.
 
I am sick of the dishonor that the GOP has brought this country. What
have we done with our allies? Are we with drawing American troops as a
sign that we don't need the world anymore? Why does the republican
party have to out right lie to the American people. Why do they
slander opponents and even other nations? Why are they backed by
fundamentalist Christians, who call for the elimination of Muslims
from America, yet call for freedom. Why did they turn the champion of
freedom into a crusading goliath?
 
Why have thousands of Americans been wounded and nearly 1000 killed?
 
Why is America sliding from its position of power?
 
Why do they hate us?
 
Why are we echoing the last days of the Roman Empire?
 
Are we in a lull or is our world about to be shattered in fire and brimstone.
 
Lets hope for the future. There seems to be plenty of people out there
who have learned to hate us over the last 4 years. We cant afford to
allow more of them to hate us/
 
why would anyone wish to continue this slide?
 
Why would anyone vote Bush?
 
Open your eyes my friends. A vote for Bush is vote for the downfall of
the America that we love.

       It was 2:00pm I finished pulling the last processor out of my last
platform. I felt like I was pulling the power plug on an incredible
experience.
  
It was 3:40 I was leaving the conference room where I had given my
presentation. I felt relief and closure. It was the end of an era. The
time of child hood was gone. I had grown up and was leaving an
incredible school of learning. Like a caught and released Salmon, I
was heading back to the wild, all the wiser. Only 80 minutes remained
of an experience that I would remember all my life.
 
It was 5:00pm. It was time to go home. I took a last look at the lab,
mumbled something to a couple of co-workers. I stopped in the
staircase and watched some Intel worker, walk to her red sports car,
watched her get in her car and drive west towards the setting sun.
I walked down to the second floor, tapped on the 'door' of my
manager's cube. He walked me down to the door in seeming silence. I
stood before the entrance to the conference center; I took a last look
at the sterile walls, the modern light fixtures and the set of double
glass doors.
 
I received some congratulations, on good work. A promise of contact,
but I was watching the security guard sign my sign out form. I shook
his hand. Turning I walked, not looking back through the double doors
and down the concrete stairs, that I had gone up and down every day
for the last 2 and half months.
 
I got to my car, pulled off my shirt threw it in the trunk. I was my
turn to chase the setting sun. As I drove away, I watched the windows
of the lab where I had worked fade into the distance. The sounds of
"When I come around" blaring out of my car's open windows. I could not
help but feel a sense of finality. This was the end of  the most
impressive experience of my life. More than anyplace else, I felt sad
leaving. It was the place that I found myself. It was the place where
I saw my destiny. I might never return to those labs and the work I
had grown to enjoy. Destiny seems to call me to the battlefield. To
fight for what I believe.
 
It turns out that the self actualization was but the beginning of the end. 
 
This was the final end of an era. 
 
The end.

       This is that feeling when you know that something is finally at an
end. This isn't moving to another country, or going off to college.
This leaving my job. I know that most people don't find this to be
least bit impactful, But sometimes you have a memorable first
experience. This was my first job and it was awesome. Fun and
relaxing, I was a kid that was welcomed in a professional
environment. At the very least it has reminded me of what I need to
work for, why I need to finish my extended essay. I guess that it
reminded me of what I could do.
 
If anything, the people from my work, from the manager on down were
some of the best people that I had ever met. Its sad to leave and go
back to the stupidly waste life of high school wasting away bored with
life. Kudos to Intel, just for being awesome.
 
I guess that work was one of the watershed events in the ending of my
soul searching. The wheels were in motion before, but the last pieces
in the puzzle just clicked into place. No matter how wonderful of an
experience that I had, I doubt that I will ever go back to a corporate
environment as an employee. I loved it, buts its not my kind of life.
I have realized that I am an activist at heart and change is my work.
Invention and innovation is to be my passion. I just don't know if
could handle a cube.
 
So I move on and walk into the sunset. Someday I might return, maybe
as an intern, because temp jobs are fun and they still pay well.
 
The last post from work.
 
Farewell Intel.

       It is just one of those days. I would say that the last couple of days gad been interesting. To say the least. Somewhere along the aftermath of finding at least for the time being what my ‘purpose’ is, I did some crazy shit. Other than an SAT II class (result: boredom), a midnight run along the east bank (result: mosquito bites), midnight drive (how I got there and back), two games of tennis (well more like 1.2), and two hours of sparing, I feel ready to get my life back on track. Except for one thing. This morning I took my shirt off to look at a scar on my stomach when I noticed something really, really strange. I no longer had hair in my armpits. It sounds gross, but it really threw me for a loop. I mean my legs are life a goddamn forest and have a pretty good moptop, but I am beginning to freak out. It was probably some cruel joke played on me by an evil sister, while I slept, but the odds of her selecting armpits over say eyebrows creeps me out anyway. But in the event that this is the beginning of some odd disease, I mark its time and place of observation. In reality I have hair there, its just really fine. Kind of scary huh?
 
I wish that that was the only problem that I have, but it is not. I am beginning too have misgivings about setting the wheels in motion for something might end in a crash. But I guess that I might as well give life a spin for change.

       If I remember correctly...it was Calvin Coolidge who remarked, without
wasting words "the business of America is business". Today it seems
that we have abandoned those simple words that drove America to
prosperity. Neither the republicans nor the democrats have the ability
to correct the downslide of America and return us to our much needed
roots. We need to raise taxes to ay for our needless wars and for
programs that that should be given at the federal level. If we tax the
rich more, chances are that they would not consume any less than they
already do, but that will allow for more governmental funds to pay for
the things that we need, like better roads, rails, airports, port
security and subsidizing of fiber optic lines and cell towers. If we
raise income taxes we would gain $300 billion a year per increment of
Bush's tax cuts. If we were not at war, we would have had an
additional $413 billion. That leaves the possibility that if linked to
a rise of federal taxes of more than a trillion dollars, in a bad
economy. We could put people to work. Think of it as a new type of new
deal to launch America into the 21st century. But such project is not
a long term solution, so maybe its time that we heed to a little but
of republican theory. Cut taxes on the corporations making for lower
overhead, and more US jobs. That's right, tax the executives more, but
make it more sense for the companies to operate in the US. Stem the
flow of jobs; create new jobs, all without violating free trade. It
time that we take a step back and re evaluate what we did when we
raised corporate taxes after the Enron debacle.

       If you know what crabgrass is you know that it spreads faster than cancer in a nuclear fall out zone. All it takes is one seed and the whole thing goes to hell. Well sometime in the last week I have undergone some sort of transformation from regular kid struggling to find out where in the crazy game of life that I am, to realizing who I am and what I want out of life. For some odd reason I feel the need to help people in peril. Not through the old kiddy dreams filled with violence and super hero’s but in a way that is meaningful to people. In a way that shows the world battle has been joined. You can call it my moral crusade, but I won’t shed a drop of another’s blood. I have vowed to make an impact. I am by no means throwing down the gauntlet and deciding whether I will enter the arena of death titled “US Politics” but I know what I want to do.
 
Sure there is always the simple dream of making millions and being wealthy. The old dream of making 15milion, then retiring by the time I turn 40 seems to have disappeared. Sure I still want to be wealthy through science, become a lawyer and litigate for nearly no cost, but I no longer can see that as a dream I now feel like I know the risks, and the steps that it will take me to get there. It seems like MS, PE, MBA then law lists the education that I would need.
 
But also for the first time I have given thought to my lifestyle and how I would want to live, whether and when I would like to raise a family. It’s strange. Most people don’t plan like this, but the struggles to find myself seem to have paid off even if it is only temporary, I have found a direction and found a path. It seems to feel like finding a lost city filled with gold. Lucky despite all the work that I have done.
 
Along the path of finding my self, I have learned something about me. I am destined to be forever and NPR listening center-left progressive…in other words a socially liberal, favoring soft power, but supportive of US power.
 
I have also realized that old stars never fade. You think you can move on, but you can’t. When one was the only one, you are stuck between a rock, a sign and a hungry dinosaur.
 
I am after all a Madcap Magician.

       Few people understand how what they vote for when they go to polls...or
so it seems. There are those that believe that private education is
better than what the government could ever provide for its own people.
Fine take your candy, but there are more imperative and effecting
battles to be fought. You don't have to raise spending for educational
success, you just need to manage funds more efficiently, but what we
cant do is continue to push jobs away from our shores with stupid
polices meant to benefit the few that are rich and policies that push
the rest of the world away from us.
 
Seriously, I wonder what those tax cuts will actually do to raise the
economy...my answer...not enough. Seriously, you could do much better.
Raise income taxes on the rich to generate revenue from the rich, then
cut taxes...not on the poor, but on corporations and small businesses,
to lower overhead opening up jobs and stemming the flow of jobs
overseas as operation in the US would become cheaper without lessening
the quality of life.
 
 cut taxes, not on the poor, but on corporations and small
businesses  
 
Of course such a plan wouldn't really gain votes, though it seems to
be the only way that one could effectively raise an economy through
tax cuts. Better than banking on consumers not to stuff their tax
rebate under a mattress.
 
The same issue holds true for making friends. Even the strongest,
smartest and richest people need allies and friends. The same holds
true for nations. In this age when every bit of information counts,
being friends with the weakest of countries might stave off a
terrorist attack...so then why are we alienating France, Germany, Italy,
and other countries who could make significant contributions to
stopping the #1 security threat, terrorism. We might be the strongest,
the richest and the overall best, but that doesn't mean that the rest
of the world is a worthless crump to wipe from our concerns, step on
and leave behind. You can never know when a friend can be there to
save you.
 
 You can never know when a friend can be there to save you.
 
 
So what angers me is that the President visited my school preaching
more money for the rich, no relief for the poor, insisting that we
have enough friends, because one is all that you would ever need.
Really, it strikes me that it seems that the average student at my
school would have a better plan...at least for making friends. It seems
that Bush isn't intelligent enough to set foot in Southridge.
 
We cant continue to be in denial that we need others. We need to
realize that nobody can go it alone. Not the rich man on the corner.
Not the United States. John Kerry seems to know all of this promising
to roll back Bush's tax cuts and offer small businesses relief.
Promising to mend relations with other countries around the world.
Bush? He promises more tax cuts for the wealthy, wars, and the death
of American power...all because he dreams of being the lone cowboy
romanticized by American Culture in the age in which he grew up.

       So, I watched this horrible movie last night...called 'Red Dawn', I had
been told that the movie was one of the main reasons that some unnamed
coworker wanted a gun. After a fiasco at Hollywood Video, I preceded
up to go to Blockbuster...then home where I locked myself in my room
and watched the movie on my computer while I worked on spreadsheets on
my laptop.
 
I really enjoy watching really bad 'trash' as my parents call them,
movies because they are stupidly gory, or idiotically funny.
Seriously, the first scene was pretty good as Commies paratroop into
America and citizens flee with their guns to defend America. But
first, the chances of America being invaded my evil paratroopers is
about the same as the chances of us being invaded by paratroopers is
about the same as being invaded by supermodels from Venus. On top of
it all to think that citizens can fight better than a trained military
force is absurd. Even a UN force could do better than most citizens.
I found Bowling for Columbine much more touching and realistic.
 
But what is by far the worst of this all is the idea that Americans
need to be able to own assault weapons for this kind of purpose. In
reality that gun is more likely to end up killing its owner than being
used against an invading force. Say that the invader was an armed
burglar, even in that case would you be able to go get your gun from
the safe and load it before someone determined to kill you succeeded.
If you have to lock up a gun, its useless. If you leave it out,
inevitably an accident will occur and someone will die.
 
Really the only part of the movie that made me feel good, was then end
when I accidentally played Greenday's "Idiot America" causing me to
laugh and shriek like mad man at 1:30am.
 
Sometimes I think that most republicans don't understand what they
vote for. They don't get reality. I once thought that the centrist
counties that I live in were a safe haven from rightist and leftist
idiocracy. Well it seems that 'idiot America' led by the Commander in
Chief of the idiots has invaded hallowed ground.
 
That's right...Mr President Bush is in my school as I write this. I wish
I was there, to heckle him , drill him on questioning, and show the
rest of my community where this idiot is taking our country.
 
Today I call my self a patriot. Trying to fight the demons within.

       Every once in while there is an event that throws you for a starts you off thinking. Usually these events are small and seemingly unimportant at the time in which they occur. This kind of snowball event makes you wonder where the hell society is headed.
 
Today I moseyed on down to Greenway Park to play a game of tennis. Sure enough all of the courts were taken, but in one there was a larger woman with some larger kids playing catch with scoopers. So I politely asked her to yield the court as those are the best free park courts around. Pointing out that 1.) The tennis courts are for playing tennis 2.) The sign outside the door says and also repeats ‘reserved for tennis players’ 3.) That one of her kids was skating on the surface which ruins the courts. All would have been well as she seemed to yield the court for its proper use and move her game someplace else. I mean really she could have played that game anywhere else. But after I started to unpack, she turned and protested, that she ‘just got there’ and that she had kids…and that this was a good spot…and other wise whining. Realizing that there was no way out of the situation without decrementing the summer experience of the little kids. I gave up.
 
As pointless as this story is, it reminds me that 1.) Americans are used to succumbing authority to those who can only claim it 2.) Rules by Authority are taken as only suggestions 3.) The reason that 1 and 2 coexist is because of an invention of new type of emotional appeal…the whine. If the lady had told me straight up that she had walked there and that the children wanted to play, countering my rules based claim…I would have respected that. But whine to me? A teenager?
 
There seemed to have been a time the ‘Average American’ was expected to work their way. Today we whine.
 
To often I feel that America is regressing. Bad policies…and a society that refuses to grow up.

       Looking back at all of the songs that have rested in the spot of
"favorite song" over the past year I can see that they have two
distinct themes: Politics and longing. Of all of these songs only one
was without words, 'Hero's Dream' the last classical song that
occupied that spot. It seems that the classical genre is the last of a
dying art of true music.
 
 . It seems that the classical genre is the last of a dying
art of true music.
 
 
Why? Because today many of us care about how the song relates to us.
We don't like to admit it but its true. And sadly the moving chords
that stir such deep thoughts rarely accomplish this goal.
But the rest of the songs seem to be divided. But the songs of longing
like those by Blink and Bare naked Ladies didn't stand at the top of
the list for very long. For me the songs that last are those that are
the ones that give me a message. Like the Stradovarious song 'Soldiers
Prayer'. As I became more and more opposed to the war in Iraq as the
rationale was proved to be false, the deaths of the soldiers for no
real benefit to the US angered me. They had been betrayed and it
seemed that song was the embodiment of it. Likewise as I have learned
to loathe the conservative, America wasting policies of the current
government and mainstream America that seems to care amore about
rhetoric, the President's wife, and which celebrity just married a
donkey,  Greenday's 'Idiot America' seems to resonate with me.
 
I can't help thinking that life would be better of only people would
open their eyes and take a look outside their own insulated lives.
LOOK at what havoc our greed can cause, look what your need to have
_______ (item) does to people around the world.
 
I guess I just want people to pay attention more to the 'now' and be
more observant. Look at the world through your song, hopefully it
resonates with you.

       I lay in bed last night looking up at the stars (I have a skylight
over my bed) wonderingâ¦wondering what life would have been like if
only I had made some different choices. I mean what would I have
become if I had not opened my eyes and taken a look at the world,
beyond that of which is presented in school and the American media
conglomerates. Would I have become an activist? If I was not pushed in
math at an early age and taught to worship science, would I like
technology? If I had only followed what I wanted to do would the
course of time have forced me to appreciate history? If I had not
decided that I could not afford to waste time on my way to my life
goals, would I have been forced to re-evaluate myself. If death had
not offered his icy touch to those I know, where would I be today? If
I had chosen a path of social instead of academic development, how
would things be different today?
 
As what seemed to be a shooting star streaked across the sky, I
dreamed. I dreamed of life with no broken elbow, and of impending
disaster. It was then that I found myself on a cruise ship with
hundreds of people that I had let pass in an out of my life with no
second thoughts and those that are destined for that same faith. In an
effort to find my way to rooms that lacked any logical order or number
in labyrinth like hallways, I was forced to interact. To talk to
friends that I had not seen in 10 years, to interact with those that I
avoid, and rely on others for directions.
 
It wouldn't have seemed so bad, except that the ship caught fire
because of some cigarette (don't ask) and all I did was stand. Stand
and let the fire consume me, warm me as my soul winked out of
existence.
 
But it was the last image that scared me the most was the aftermath.
Looking down, I knew that all the people were sad,  but the only two
'people' I could actually see was Darilyn Barney and purple dinosaur
that goes by a similar name.
 
So what the hell does that mean?
 
It would have made more sense for George W Bush or Ayatollah Khomeni
to have cried for me.
 
Maybe...I am becoming delusional...

       Something has been at the edge of my mind for a very long time...a
whole day, long for my short male attention span. It is the fact that
some people are clueless and unobservant to the point where a siren
goes off in my head that seems to say "END THIS CONVERSTION NOW OR YOU
ARE GOING TO DIE OF DISBELIEF", but it's the worst when its from
someone you know is smart. The you want to just sit there and cry. Cry
for them, cry for the world....
 
I think that I am not alone when I say that clueless people annoy me.
Once ok, twice sure I can be that nice...but EVERY time!!! I mean sure
one person I can deal with, no matter who they are. But two people at
the same time!!! AND 3 different people in a day. I feel like calling
them all up and saying "I have thought about you all day, I could love
you but....I can't believe how ignorant you are..." But I can't make
myself be that cruel.
  
Actually it is probably just me...
  
Good night

       It seems like you can't trust anyone these days. It seems like the
news has become so sensationalized and polarized that the news is made
to tilt your views. Even worse balanced news is hard to find as the
government has become America's biggest Liar under Bush and Co.
 
This is a headline ripped from the Financial Times "F15 looses battle
with Russian fighter Plane piloted by Indians. Its enough to scare any
military analyst, right? Well the article does go on to read. "the
F-15 Eagle America's top fighter plane was beaten 90% of the time.
Accounts of the still classified 'Cope India' mission vary with some
suggesting that American pilots were without the best radar equipment,
in helmet targeting systems and may have been outnumber 2 to 1."
Fortunately  the Financial Times hit the ball right on the nose, when
they further write, that "the candor of the pentagon about this
exercise was ultimately driven by the interest in the preserving the
FA-22 Raptor program for the next generation of strike fighter." That
type of quick analysis, does not strike me as unbalanced as it places
the US fighter as unequal, then suggests that maybe the trials were
imbalanced for a reason. That is why I like the Financial Times.
  
MSNBC on the other hand had this title "300 militants dead, 15 US
soldiers hurt." In the article they also mention that 3 US troops
died. 15 hurt is preferable to 3 dead isn't it? Thank NBC and
Micro$oft for doing their patriotic duty.
  
Then there is Slate and the mile long list of Bushisms...some one
picked sides in this election...
  
The Financial Times (FT) doesn't even bother to sway opinions on the
US election. Only reporting the poll numbers and facts.
  
I have no such noble British-type intentions.

       So I once heard this man speak. He talked of global unity and
equality. He seemed to be a man of virtue. He was running for
President of the United States. That's when I turned a little
something on in my head. I like to call it a big switch box. Everyone
else calls it a brain. Here is a man that was thrown into prison and
pardoned by Bill Clinton, who then decided to run President. This is a
man whose idea it is to end the reign and stranglehold that the World
Bank and the IMF have over the world by building a global highway
system that uses bridges accross the oceans. He claims that the
technology is here now. Trade would then be easier and that
globalization would go way (wtf!). He then goes on to say that the
scheme would be funded by the groups responsible for building
infrastructure around the world. Namely the IMF and the world bank.
This man is either a lunatic of an evil genius. If his plan fails
because it would not be financially viable, even if the technology is
out there, he can blame the banks for not really caring about the
world. If they do by some amount of sheer stupidity undertake the task
they will be killed by the project...
 
LaRouche is a verified lunatic as much as his followers have no brain.
This man that ran for President decided to distribute the following
pamphlet to a residential apartment complex filled with kids.
http://larouchein2004.net/pages/other/2004/040614cos3.htm

so in them are titles like  "Preface: How 'The Sexual Congress of
Cultural Fascism' â Ruined the U.S.A. and Gave Us 'Beast-Man' Cheney."
  
  "Preface: How 'The Sexual Congress of Cultural Fascism' â
Ruined the U.S.A. and Gave Us 'Beast-Man' Cheney."  
 
Can we al say lunatic? Not to mention an indecent lunatic...
  
My only condolence to the rest of worldâ¦is that a couple of high
school students from here in Oregon showed him up after he finished
speaking, trapping in his indecencies and smashing his for his
impracticalities.
  
I would vote for Bush over that man.
  
I would rather die than support the contortion of government by the
perverted, neo-fascist foundations of the of the religious right and
our president. We have before us the route to hell, deeper hell, or
someone who's not sure whether they are even in hell, because they are
so vague. I will take my chances on Kerry.

       Those people that lie on the fringes of my life are those I tend to ignore the most (I say most because I really ignore everyone), so when my cell phone rung at 6:10 with a "Caller ID Unavailable" title I was tempted to reject the call, but I picked it up anyway. It turned out to be a childhood friend that wanted to talk. One that I had not heard from in 6 years. It was one of those conversations that leave you thinking "what the hell just happened?" The details of the call are unimportant, but it seems that this was the event of the day. Why? Because it reminded me of the all of the times I have pushed the proverbial 'reject button' never wanting to know what might be lurking in the darkness.
 
Of course none of this matters and its all about the "what if?" type of questions for which there are infinite numbers and can sound like “what if Michael Dukakis hadn’t taken his picture in a tank?” But it’s still all fun to wonder..and...consuming to think about. Oh well, wondering what could have been is a waste.
 
So Joke time…

Thank Sam for that one…:-P

       Every once in a while man needs to be reminded of his mortality. For
the last couple of year I have struggled to cope with events around
me, but through it all I always had this sense that everything would
work out or me. If things didn't, it was ok, it was not the end of the
world because I was still alive. But in the end it is the near death
experiences that frighten the most. But really the only the ones for
which you are conscious for are the ones that leave a mark on the rest
of your life. Things like nearly drowning in a swimming pool when you
were small, drifting under the water for a seeming eternity. Such
events make falling 20 ft off a tree, falling through a 5 ft crack in
a jetty and having to swim your way out, sliding half way down a
slate covered ski run unto some trees with your foot caught between
the crank and the frame of your mountain bike seem like routine and
safe. All of which made yesterday a memorable day.
 
I didn't win the lottery, find a cure for cancer or meet the girl of
my dreams; yet I consider yesterday to be one of the luckiest days of
my life. Regardless of the whether or not I won the tennis game that I
played yesterday, I was grateful at the end of the night. I was ALIVE
and that is what mattered.
  
  I was grateful at the end of the night. I was ALIVE and
that is what mattered. 
 
As it turns out in the mad rush to turn in my project title form to
ASE down at Portland State University. I drove down there and hand
delivered the form. As anyone who ever tries to get out of the city
around 5:30pm knows US26 is a nightmare of parking lot type nature. So
I did what I always do when I heard that there was an accident on I5.
I took Barbur Boulevard-Bertha to get to Beaverton. Well the first
problem I noticed right away. The lack of rain, and the abundance of
heat over the last couple of months had decomposed the tar slightly. As a result, the sudden rain had was leaving a foamy and oily residue on the surface of the road. So I
figured that I would drive I little slower and not try to beat the
clock on the way home. But that right turn that then curves left on
Bertha nearly killed me.
  
I drive a car, rather a mini-SUV that is rear wheel drive until one
chooses to engage the 4wheel drive. This car is also very light and
for some god knows what reason possesses a 200 hp HO v6 engine and
runs on skinny touring tires. So taking this turn uphill on to Bertha,
at a very slow speed my rear tires lost traction, causing the car to
fishtail to the right extremely fast. As I tried to correct the
impending spin I realized that inexplicably the steering column had
locked. The brakes were useless at this point and I spun around,
seemingly on 2 of 4 wheels before I was able to rip the steering
column loose and jam on the brakes. I stopped literally 2 inches from
the drivers side door of a Ford Explorer in the left turn lane.
Rolling down his window the driver of the Explorer tossed down his
cell phone and said,
"Holly shit, first I thought that you were
gonna hit me. Either you are a fuckin' lucky kid or God is one your
side. Straighten your wheels and back up slowly."


My only reply was "oh fuck" in a very relieved voice (I realize how
oxymoronic that sounds).
  
  Either you are a fucking lucky kid or God is one your
side.  
 
Now most people would think, oh sure you might have gotten in an
accident but died? My answer is very simple probably not. Taking a
look at the underside of the sun-visor in my car, written in bold
letters are the words "DANGER: HIGH ROLL OVER RISK". I was relieved
when the all 4 wheels went back on the ground, but maybe it was just
hella scary. This event is not going to get me to convert to a
Jehovah's Witness or Mormonism or any other near fundamentalist god
fearing religion or even make me observe my own.
  
Regardless of the true risk, this is an event that changed me. I feel
glad to be living and unhurt. Even more glad that I didn't hit someone
else. Maybe I have a destiny, but...I am still probably a closet
atheist. God has got to do better for the rest of the world.

       To many little kids, sports stars are heroes, folks who do the
impossible and are the epitome of strength and will. I myself was no
exception idolizing Tom Glavine, Michael Johnson, Andre Agassi (even
when he sucked), and Michael Jordan. These were the people that I
pretended that I was when I played sports, But I am saddened by the
new heralded athletes.
 
From the performance enhancing drugs to hard street varieties, too
many of the top athletes are popping, injecting and sniffing. From
Mark McGuire to Barry Bonds and the Balco crew, performance enhancing
drugs have become the standard in sports. More than just harmless
kicks to make the show better, these drugs have the ability to kill.
It is suspected that Marco Pantini, the once venerable cyclist from
Italy died from his use of EPO, which thickened his blood until his
heart could no longer beat.
 
 more than just harmless kicks, (performance enhancing)
drugs have the ability to kill 
 
So it seems in order that the use of performance enhancing drugs has
risen dramatically at the high school level. If the pro's do it so can
anyone else. Is this the explanation for the rise in steroid use?
 
But more concerning are the hard drug users. Look at Ricky Williams, a
star quitting because of pot. Quincy Carter testing positive for
cocaine who will probably get off. What message are kids getting from
these athletes? That drug use is ok? Guess what? The media has a habit
of making a bad situation worse. EPSN's 'all weed' team that would
supposedly beat all comers is a sign that the media has glorified drug
use and told kids drug abuse is ok.
 
  the media has glorified drug use and told kids drug abuse
is ok. 
 
So I guess that in the end, there is nothing that we can do but stop
and reject the heralding of doping athletesâ¦or simply give up all hope
of creating a clean sport and embrace the idea that the spectacled
evil scientists have conquered the warriors who battle for dominance
in the sports that we love.

       As the sky remains grey and tests continue to run. I sit still in the
same cold room. It feels less like a dungeon and more like a place
that is insulated from the rest of the world. With glass and concrete
surrounding me and HEPA filters keeping the air clean. The cold air
conditioned air is vastly different than the humid warm summer
thunderstorm prelude like weather. Alone and jaded in a sea of
circuits I sit, working and testing. Thinking. Thinking of the
opportunities that I have had the privilege to throw away, I realize
that the time is upon me not to do so for my next endeavor. Like an
election in bad taste the rat race in on. The next two weeks are going
to be a messy and wonderful ride. So many  things that I had promised
my self to do before the end of July that I have yet to do.
 
I guess I feel like Hillary Clinton, so many promises and nothing
done. Nothing but constant ranting. Off to make amends.

       I tend to be a believer in the law of statistical averages. I am one
who believes that what goes up must come down, providing that the object
doesn't cheat. So today's grey sky here, should not make much of an
impact on me. Forget about the fact that I am sitting here in a cold
air-conditioned lab, but I feel absolutely deprived. Deprived of a
light to guide me and warm my soul. Taking a look at my present life I
realize that I have no one to hold in the highest regard. Surely, I
respect people, but really there is no-one that I look forward to
meeting or activity that I wish that I could do. There is nothing to
drive me. As sad as it is, I am sitting here scrolling through the
numbers on my cell phone deleting names of people I know that I will
never bother to call again and looking at ones that I should have
called long ago. Blame it on being a gadget freak. Blame it on being a
17 year old male in a tech company. But I can tell you, people are
never alone.
 
To the people that have passed in and out of my life in record time, I
feel no pangs. But to those whom I have pointedly relegated to the
outer spheres of my periphery toying with their minds and thoughts for
the purpose of mental stimulus, I feel no regret. I am in this respect
as ruthless as President Bush's barbaric foreign policy. But there are
those that I barely know whose similarities in a patterns of thought
appall and intrigue me, those whose efforts to express true opinions
have fallen short due to fear, and one for whom I can offer no
explanation except that I myself know not why I loose coherency in
your presence; people that I can never forget. So really I might not
be as ruthless as I thought. Not quite the machine bent on
accomplishing the impossible, fueled by sarcasm and irony, I feared I
once was.
 
Yet even such a victory, in realizing my cold humanity strikes me with
fright. I know I am not alone. I have not accused an opponent of
rape...but my behavioral traits make me wonder...
 
Am I in the same boat as Rev Al Sharpton?

       Life is a sad, sad place. I woke up this morning and facing a dreary
sky, I lethargically dragged my self out of bed, into my car, and off
to work. Listening to NPR, my customary morning habit, I heard a
report on the stalling by the Sudanese government regarding the
disarmament of the Janjaweed in Darfur. For a dictaorship that has
declared war on its own people then stalling in order to kill as many
as might be allowed by the international community, Sudan is hardly
treading on new ground. But therein lies the problem. We as the people
of the United States can't intervene in Sudan.

 
 We as the people of the United States can't intervene in
Sudan.  

 
Why? Because we are already busy with killing of of our own in Iraq, a
sitution that prevents NATO involvment even though the European
Command is responsible for Africa as well. It is not a matter of troop
strength but rather the impressions that we would send to the
thousands of peace loving muslims around the world. We cannot afford
to invade another Arab nation and still claim that we don't have any
imperialistic intensions. Likewise, it seems that the UN blue helmets
are all but useless, the British cant afford to send more troops
abroad, and looking that the failure of the EU forces to crackdown on
violence in the Balkans, and the same failure of similar forces to
secure Afganistan. So in effect, like the millions of Rawandans and
Congolese that have died, we can expect the people of Darfur to be
screwed as well.

But really the sitaution is no different than the "my hands were tied"
excuse that we use when things spin out of control and you did nothing
to even TRY to contain it. I mean I know that at least in the time of
my short existence things only get worse when you dont step up to the
plate and admit that you cant at the outset. Sticking sharply in my
mind was a incident that struck me sophmore year. Silence shattered
those who had expected an answer. All I had to have said was no "I
cant do that, previous commitment." Instead the what-ifs still ring in
my head today. Surely our leaders can do better. They need to absolve
themselves of military commitment; maybe someone else will try and
more countries will get involved.
 
Just my worthless 2 cents.

       Supposing that looking into the fires of hell was possible, I don't doubt that such
fires will contain, politicians, terrorists, dictators and even benevolent leaders, all guilty of the same sin. They thrive off the fears of others. Driving, herding and controlling not only the function of their subjects, but also the way in which they think. Even one of my favorite politicians John Edwards (apart from his outright screwing of free trade) speaks to the fears of Americans when be proclaims "Hope is on the way!"

Such is the ridiculousness of the rampant use of fear. But terrorists like Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat are not alone in their use as a controlling mechanism. Few people keep relations with others without the use of fear. From fear of loosing a job, to the fear of loosing an invested friendship we use these fear tactics on each other on a daily basis. In turn that makes us all some sort of demented emotional'terrorist' (using the term as someone who seeks to terrorize as a primary means of control. Such a use of fear has been the root of conflict and mass genocide as well as massive effort to 'defeat''evil'. But can the good impacts of fear, like the defeat of the USSR by Reagan and the brave actions by US GI's in WWII make the use of fear as a societal acceptable tactic for dealing with people. It was after all Roosevelt who coined the phrase "we have nothing to fear but fear itself", but such an appeal to tradition fails to account for the other circumstances that were present in that situation. But the problem is that we play with each other's fears on a daily basis, because that is often the fastest way to get results.

that is often the fastest way to get results 
 
But what are the consequences of such rampant abuse of each other's noggin? Perhaps more suicide, murder and other violent crime. But we all know for sure that the media overplays every death in this culture of fear. Making each death, injury and anct of violence a sensational to the point of entertainment. Such is truely a dark side to our culture.
 
But the worst part is that election season is still just warming up. YOU can bet on the two presidential wannabe men to play more on fears than real hopes. It seems like we really do hate vegetables, because it seems that we prefer a piece of stick. That's right, we like something that hurts over food!
 
What might you ask prompted this rant? The sight of Washington DC Transit Police searching a subway with m16's knowing that they probably are not trained with that weapon and would likely use it to arrest someone for eating on the subway (remember last week), not catch terrorists. Oh, and my first speeding ticket trial date was scheduled. 3mph f****** over the limit!!!
