      I've done shockingly little work today. I have, in fact, spent a large proportion of it on the interweb.  I also downloaded the 14 day trial of Star Wars: Galaxies last night, all two gig of it. I'm moist with anticipation. I think I may create a wookiee exotic dancer.

      It's the future, man.  Fonz, you could get yourself a feed reader (Google for it), and then look at the BOA using it's RSS feed. It'll just look like you have an email program open, or somesuch.

      i am a pulling 66%er. that makes me a little better than ross. which makes sense to me. i am also 30% gay, which is too straight.  i think that these tests are indeed "balls".

<date>03,June,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      I didn't half panic when that needle went all the way up to 100% gay, til I realised it was just calculating my score.  I am 26% gay, which is apparently &quot;Too Straight&quot;.

      I was brutally honest in the pull-o-meter, and I got 54%. I am a Shy Guy.  Seems about right.  Of course, that was Sober Fonz taking the test.  If Drunk Fonz were taking the test, who knows what score he'd get?

<date>03,June,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      I'm 43% gay, and apparently a 'happy and well adjusted hetero man'. See, it must be true if Channel 4 says it.  I also have a 62% chance of pulling, and it says:  'Always in control, and that often works out the best on a holiday night out, But stop playing it so safe! We know its not cool to get wasted, but you need to let down your hair and live a little! Perhaps a bit of dutch courage will give you that pep you need to go for it a bit more.'  I'm a little confused by that, as I chose to go without food and went for the beers, so would be legless by about half way round.

      I took one of those gay tests before, where it reckoned everyone was at least 37% gay on average.  I think I was 1% nmore hetero than average, which surprised me as much as anyone.

      See if you are  urlLink good at pulling ...I got 81%. Go here to see how  urlLink gay you are  Fonz anything less than 50% and I know you are lying! I got 29% which is just the right amount of gayness. If the above links come out stupid apologies...I just copied fonz's code and pasted

      If you use the 'post a full message' link, and use the interweb link button to insert the hutchtemel for you, it doesn't add the target=blank shiznit by default. Is there a way to change that, or am I going to have to learn something, and do my linking myself?
     
    
</post>

<date>03,June,2004</date>

      makes the target of the link open in a new window. thing is, my work pc usually has about 9 ie windows open at any one point, and takes 30 seconds to open another one. whereas i don't mind hopping forwards and backwards in my "leisure" window. hence my behaviour.  no problem to watch the botter; it's shorter than the other two, and apparently better - i watched the second one the other day, and pronounced it "meh".  you know, like ross would have done. only not as well.

<date>03,June,2004</date>

      It makes the link open in a new window, standard practice if you are linking to a page on an external site.  i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;  I think.  It's not easy typing that in html.

      I demand when you post a link next time dave, that you use a target=&quot;_blank&quot; thing.  Do it.  Now then, to importnat matters.  I think I need to see Larry Botter and The Prisoner of Azerbaijan this weekend, for reviewing purposes.  What are the chances of us catching a showing, maybe you'll see me at the mattinee on Sunday?

      I got six out of seven on the BBC news quiz, because I always have to guess at the last question, about the ages of people I don't know.  I actually knew the people today, but misread the question, and put them in order of oldest first. Tits.

      You go to settings, then e-mail.  Then there are two address options.  As dave says, the bottom one has a box in the middle of an e-mail address for you to put a password in.  Then you e-mail to that address, and bob is etc..

      The page that is Any idea what time we are due in Epson? I will be nursing a hangover undoubtedly so need to mentally prepare myself for an hour long train trip from Angel. I just ate a load of broccoli...I remember a few years ago I was like "what the fuck is a broccoli?" not believing anything could be so disgusting.  Gradually over time it's become my favourite vegetable. I think we should feature up this page a bit so we can see some distinct advantages over the old one. Maybe an option to upload pictures etc. to the right of the message entry box

      Yeah...spam is a fucker and there is nowt you can do about it really. There is one reasonably effective method which is a plugin for outlook which my old man used for a wile.  (Can't remember what it is called or where I got it from so you'd have to research it a bit!)   It's kind of similar to adaware in a way though.  First it aloows you to specify basic rules (which you can do in outlook already) i.e filter out emails with abnormal characters in the address field/emails with certain attachments etc. The best bit is log file that you download every day from the plugin server which contains a relatively up to date list of spam addresses/domains/subject titles (new ones are created every minute so it doesn't catch everything) He was getting somewhere in the region of 100 spam mails coming from jap domains through to standard "porn" domains...when he slammed this on he got it down to about 10 a day. I spoke to him about this already as I need it but he doesn't have it anymore...anyone tracks this app down or something similar let me know as I also want to break things at the moment.

      outlook 2003 is pretty good at detecting and removing spam, but not 100%. about the only thing you can do is tell it to accept mail only from people in your address book, like on hotmail.
     
    
</post>

<date>11,June,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      That was not the answer I was looking for.  It seems to me, the smart spammer could send out an html e-mail, and the server would register the e-mail address was valid when the user read the e-mail and the html got served.  Which is pretty much what I expect they do. So as you say, you can't stop the flow of spam.  I thought there might be some sort of blocker I could get.

      if you're being spammed, you're effectively bummed. there is no escape. if you click the Remove Me links, you just confirm to them that your email address is active, and they redouble their efforts. the only solution is to close the account and start another.  it annoys the shit out of me because i had a perfectly good email address for 6 years, then some cunts got hold of it through a whois record and now it's 50 spam for every proper email i get. it gives me the rage.

      my kev is the III, and is a bit out of date, although i only found that out once i was pretty far into my game. they've release a couple of expansion packs and a raft of patches, so i thought that if i were to have another shot at it, i'd want to get all the newest stuff together first. if you really want the one i'm using, i'll see what i can do, but you'd probably be better off getting hold of a newer version yourself, as that's what i'm intending to do.  i've read a couple of guides to playing on the harder levels of kev, and it's super-hard and mind-blowingly technical. i'm not sure i have the patience to calculate the precise number of turns it will take my worker unit to cross a river, irrigate on square, and mine another and rationalise that against controlling my tax rate so that a new science advance arrives exactly when i need it, while all the time managing my city population's working pattern and growth to alter levels of production to synchronise with an anticipated event in 40 turns' time.  for christ's sake.   urlLink a good bomb or a bad bomb?

      Yes, all he will be.  I did the IQ test just now, and got the same score as dave, which i am assuming means we both got them all right:  &quot;Your IQ score is 136   This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.   Your Intellectual Type is Visionary Philosopher. This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways.

      Has Ross finally learned some hutchtemmel?  Dave, can't you just explain to your FM that you're not in a client-facing role, and therefore can dress like a sack of shit if you feel like it?  And also explain why it would be a good idea for him to put his face in a blender.

      That's one sleepy Bambos.  I have a Linksys BEFSR41 v2. All I had to do was upgrade the firmware. Unfortunately, Linksys have designed their site such that it's actually impossible to find anything. Consequently, I was under the mistaken belief that the last upgrade was this time last year (as that's what the site told me), when in reality there had been two since then.  Routers are very interesting.  Also -  urlLink BT finally decides to ditch the shitty old switching phone network .

      what kind of router do you have, and what did you need to do to it?  bambos set up our router, and it works pretty well as far as i know. i think if it had been left to me and yove, one of us would be dead by now, and the other would be sobbing in a corner somewhere. the router would still be in its box, i imagine.  mind you, that's the same bambos that fell asleep on the victoria line at euston and woke up in seven sisters. and it was going south when he got on.   urlLink see where he went wrong

      Ties are gay.  I like being able to come into work in whatever I like, although it makes it harder to distinguish between weekdays and weekends.  I think most of Britney's knee problems could be improved by letting me massage her.  Of course, sometimes the area that is sore isn't the area you need to massage, which I would explain to her as I fondled he boobs and diddled her nubbin.    I've gone over to the bad place.

      According to my score predictions, it all goes swimmingly in the group stages.  Then England go out to Spain in the Quarter Finals (on penalties after a 2-2 draw) and Italy go on to win, having narrowly beaten France in the semis.

      Too late for you guys but I've just joined a league with mates on this site http://en.fantasy.euro2004.com/  It's got much better scoring with assists, clean sheets, cards, defensive clean sheets, etc. Only missing thing is choosing a manager.  If anyone wants to start on this one let me know as I've started a seperate league we can use when I was mucking about.

      I made the change.  Did you notice all three of us have opted for the same manager?  That should ensure some pretty bad luck, right there.  I put up my World Cup Wall Chart the other day.  I know technically it's a Euro 2004 Wall Chart, but that doesn't have the same ring to it.  So I shall be refering to it as my World Cup Wall Chart anyway.

      The way I see it is that Becks is more likely to score than Gerrard full stop. (Frank Lampost is more likely to score than Stevie G) Becks is also less likely to get broken/sent off in a rage of red-misted headwrong  I've decided than I'll keep my team as it is, downgrading my Wesley to a Latvian or a Stelios would only allow to upgrade my Torres to a Morientes/Trezu-Gay and not all the way up to a Ruud/Thierry.  Thats not a good enough trade off

      i had a ross-inspired dream once. it ended with jets firing rockets past skyscrapers into this enormous pair of legs that was terrorising tokyo.  i finally found  urlLink yoav's purpose .  i stopped playing kevinisation at half ten last night, and managed to get to bed on time. and then i had a phone call at about 12.45. it was a cheerful greek, who said "i fell asleep on the tube and i'm stuck in seven sisters. i can't get back to balham. can i come and stay at yours?". i said yes.  then there was another call a minute later: "do you know any taxi numbers? there's only one driver here and he's a mentalist who doesn't know where camden is". i gave him the only taxi number i know.  then another call: "the taxi number's no good, there's no-one this side of london. none of the bus drivers knows which bus i need. help!". i gave him the number for the transport helpline.  at 2.45am, i had a bambos on my doorstep.  this morning, i mostly want to die.

      The way I see it is that Gerrard's more likely to score from open play, and is the braver choice, but Beckham takes all our penalties and free kicks, and with Mickey on the pitch we're bound to get a penalty or two...  I'm erring on the side of swapping Gerrard for Becks.  I haven't seen your formation manx, but you do need midfielders who are going to score.  They also get an extra point for scoring over a striker.  So the decision is yours really.  Have you signed up to the league?  I had a dream that Dolly's house kept getting burgled last night.  It got burgled once, and she was too afraid to stay there, so she left the house and stayed at someone else's.  So the burglars broke back into it again.  The next day the same thing happened, but this time she left her keys in the door, and the burglars took EVERYTHING.  I suppose it was a Ross-inspired dream on some level.

I hate Websense more than Jesus.    And he hates it a lot.

      it's finally  urlLink here . mmmmmmmgoodyumyesnice.  i never look at the ads, but i suppose they're google context-sensitive efforts. and we've mentioned mckellen and his ilk a fair bit here, so god knows what the old googlometer's made of it all.

      The overnet connection isn't of much use unless you are sharing over 20 odd gigs...overnet is a series of hubs which have minimum shares.  Anything of worth is usually only found on servers over 20 gigs...hence if you aren't sharing enough...the hub won't feed you anything. Overnet is pretty pants anyway...I used it a year ago or so for a couple of months...fastish connection speeds but you always get cut off by the people you download from if you ever get going too fast.  Not a problem for small files but for films and isos etc. it's a real pain.

      For the record, eDonkey2000 came first, and connects to Overnet and another ed2k server.  eMule came second, and seems to run better and look nicer, but it only connects to one ed2k server and not overnet.  Og course, they both have updates released regularly, so neither of them are older and therefore worse.  I'm not sure which is better, though.  Is it lunch time yet?

      Having listened to your collective eDonkey/eMule ramblings, I've come to the conclusion that I am the most knowledgable on the subject.  I'm still not sure who I WANT England to face if we get to the Quarter Finals.  My inkling is Greece, but then they gave us a run for our money a few years back and dicked Portugal the other day, didn't they?  I don't really want to come up against Spain, even though they bottle it a lot.  Maybe Portugal is a handy middle road...

      i've used emule, and found it prettier. i've no idea how performance compares, though.  we face the winner of group a (is it? the one with greece, spain, russia and portugal), assuming we come second in the group. so it looks like spain at the moment, although if greece beat them, it may well be bambos' buddies.  i'm finishing work at half five tonight, going home, getting changed, pouring some kind of food into my mouth, then heading for hammersmith about 6.45, i imagine. should arrive a little before half seven, in time to pull aiden out of whichever establishment of ill-repute he's accidentally wandered into, pick up the tickets, resuscitate damo (with those little heart-paddles that george clooney uses) and take our seats in time to hear that the show's cancelled because it's too hot or something.  that's my plan.

      I think thats a promise that Joe just can't make, or at least keep.  To get to Hammersmith my research tells me you go to Hammersmith tube (which was as big a shock to me as i'm sure it is to you)  This lies on the Hammersmith & City, Piccadilly, and District lines.  I expect the Apollo should be pretty clearly signposted from the tube.  So, whats the plan

      I moved over form the eDonkey to the eMule last night.  I am undecided about the change so far. eMule doesn't connect to the Overnet server, does it?  So who do we want England to face in the quarter finals if they ever get that far?  I demand answers.

      there is a shower. but only one, and it turns out that people use it all the time. i'm not sure i should be nipping off for a shower after 9.30, but seeing as i arrived in plenty of time before work and was denied my opportunity, i don't see that i have any choice. it's either shower now or smell bad until lunchtime.  no sign of the tickets, but i have a nagging feeling that the envelope containing them is sitting under a stack of papers on yoav's desk somewhere... like that old insurance letter that they still talk about in hushed tones at the back of pubs. i'm calling the customer service line as soon as it opens - at half ten.

       We were losing the game 1-0. She was on there a long time and nobody seemed to want to do anything about it. In the end it was a case of get over there and push her off the pitch...     ...the stewards and police were letting her get on with it and they seemed to be quite happy to stand there and look at her. I'm going to send her a letter to say thank you because she fired me up a lot and a few minutes later I scored our equalising goal!

      Any transfers you make should be in the Czechs I reckon...German/Holland will not be high scoring, nor is it safe to predict either will keep a clean sheet. It's kind of hard to keep track of what points you should have though because of managers/cards/goals/clean sheets...even if there is something slightly wrong with the calculation - we all "suffer" from it.

      It's always a good idea.  I've been needlessly productive today.  In fact, I'd say I've done a whole week's worth of work in my few hours here today.  But there's nothing else to do...  It seems wrong, yet it sounds so right.  I have one more job to do, but I can't charge for it if I do it today because I've already charged out my six hours of time.  So I might leave it for m'colleague to do on Monday, and spend the next hour an a half filling out a job application form instead.

      Yeah, the dutch are going out in the next match anyway, so my support for them will be short lived.  Besides, I've noticed while watching them that they are very entertaining - every so often they let what appears to be a horse on to the pitch and they just let it gallop at the goal.  From six yards out.  The context banner at the top seems to be about football now.  Oh yeah, dave, I've noticed that when I load this page and scroll down, it suddenly jumps back to your anchor tag at the top.  So I have to scroll down again. I thought perhaps I had a #top on the end of my bookmark, but I don't.  So it must be your fault that this happens.  Make it stop doing that to me.

      my first reaction was to go with the dutch, as i've done in every competition since 1998 after we've gone out ("dennish bergkamp! dennish bergkamp! DENNISH BERGKAMP!" etc), but then i remembered that the world's only other diving horse plays for them, and i don't want him to win anything.  so now i'm an honourary czech. go praha. go pavel.

      That was a negative, and what i need is 2 positives.  Oh well, at least all that 'eng-er-lund are gonna win' bollocks is finished.  All we need is Henman to go out of Wimbledon as soon as hunmaly possible and we can have a relaxed fucking summer.  The weight of my support is now behind the Czechs

      Indeed.  I have put a guy away.  I have to go back on Monday and do it all again though.  And I have to go to work tomorrow I think.  Also, Malaga is in Spain, not Greece, although I suspect damo will protest that he already knew that, but not offer an explanation of his Greece - Malaga comment.  Call me Nostradamus.  I need to tinker with my team for tonight's match... do I put my eggs in the England basket, or do I "bet against" them to ensure a result either way. Hmmm.

      I thought you had a bit of a shit day pointswise yesterday Dave.  I had four Dutchmen, including Van Nistelrooydonk.  I was bit gutted about the Czech second string, i was pretty sure Nedved would be rested but I expected Cech to play at least.   I actually like the look of my team now and am going to restrict my tinkering, i wouldn't mind a Portugeasy player or two but would that be disloyal?  I might transfer out Reizeger for an englishman maybe.

      although someone tole me that the aguilera monster was in it, and she's about 33. the main one is 17, as far as i know. which is legal in some states. anyway, you should never use that phrase, as what you need to say is:  "...while definitely a girl film, there's plenty of eye candy from which the boys can form ejaculatory teenage fuck fantasies..."  i have a new plan for the weekend. ed's driving up on saturday morning from epsom, so i'm going to high-tail it down there pronto on saturday and join him in the capri-of-love all the way up the m40. assuming we go down the m40. as such, i won't be going up on friday anymore. in case that wasn't clear.  i'm hungry.

      I'm writing a review of Mean Girls.  Do you think I'm allowed to say the following:  "...while definitely a girl film, there's plenty of eye candy for boys to feast their eyes on too..."  Or does that just reveal to the world what a pervert I am? I think the girls in it play 15 year olds, but the actresses that play them are about 18 I think.  I'm wrong, aren't I?

      Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Wayne Rooney are standing before God at the throne of Heaven. God looks at them and says; "before granting you a place at my side, I must first ask you what you believe in." Addressing Ronaldo first he asks, "what do you believe?" Ronaldo looks God in the eye and states passionately, "I believe Football to be the food of life. Nothing else brings such unbridled joy to so many people from the slums of Rio to the bright lights of Madrid. I have devoted my life to bring such joy to people who stood on the terraces supporting their club." God looks up and offers Ronaldo the seat to his left. He then turns to Luis Figo , "and you, Luis , what do you believe?" Figo stands tall and proud, "I believe courage, honour and passion are the fundamentals to life and I've spent my whole playing career providing a living embodiment of these traits." God, moved by the passion of the speech offers Figo the seat to his right. Finally, he turns to Wayne Rooney , "and you, Wayne , what do you believe?"   "I believe" says Rooney "you're sitting in my seat."

I've seen that photo of Rooney, its quite good.  Has anyone seen the mocked up sky sports article about ferrari hiring some new pit crew, thats also quite funny.

      i've fed mine the feedburner rss, then all i need to do is leave the mouse pointer over each post for a couple of seconds to get the full effort. it's not perfect, though - although you can jam it full of rss feeds from all over the place and it keeps you informed. sort of. the bbc ones are good. it also saves me looking out of the window by telling me what the weather is like outside.  i went shopping. i got:  empire magazine (although i had to buy a second copy cos mysteriously the pages got stuck together on the first one, right about page 100) black dahlia dave gorman's googlewhack adventure love all the people (bill hicks) last tango in aberystwyth (read the first one - briwwiant)  it was 3 for 2 on, um, 3 of them. now i want to sit down and read them all immediately.

      I was wondering that.  Ok I'ver got this sidebar thing going on,and I'm on board with the idea.  But the best I can make it do is display the first few words of each message on the BOA, and if I click on it, it loads up the full boa in IE.  That's no good.  Tell me how to configure it Dave.

      i use desktop sidebar, which is not the best rss reader by any means, but has a host of other handy little functions. i've got 2 15" screens, so plenty of space for it; don't know whether your single gorgeous 19" lovestick can spare a couple of inches down the side.  i'm going out at lunchtime to buy books and a copy of empire. now is the time to give me any final recommendations.  i think wobu is back from israel - either that, or there was a really clumsy burglar who didn't steal anything crashing around in the kitchen at 2 o'clock this morning. i know on which i'd bet.

I think Empire is probably worht you buying this month, not just for the Knightley, but mostly for that.  Someone tell me which RSS Reader I should be using.

      it's my bloody curse again. mind you, portugal have nothing to worry about:  in their quarter final, the referee was swiss; their opponents had knocked out switzerland in the group stage, and his performance was highly questionable.  in their semi final, the referee was swedish; their opponents had knocked out sweden in the previous round, and his performance was highly questionable.  now all we need is a czech referee for the final, and we're all set. although he's german. but he probably hates the greeks anyway.  seriously, it IS a conspiracy.  i've not done any packing, and that was my one aim this evening.   i  can't do anything.

      I accidentaly just did my impression of Madonna circa 1987.  Sorry about that.  I just finished reading  Little Women , by Louisa May Alcott, which I believe makes me Edercated.  I quite enjoyed it, really.  But it's not as good as the Geisha book.  Speaking of holidays, my mum has been saying I should have one, and she's now got to the stage where she's going to go in some travel agents and try and find one for me, so I'll get back to people about it when she comes up with the goods.  Obviously, I'm too lazy to investigate the situation myself. I thought at one point I wasn't. I was wrong.

      I am a font of Knowledge, dahlia wise.  Lessee: I've read it, and enjoyed it.  It's about a woman who gets murdered in LA in the 50s, and two cops have to investigate.  And they both fall in love with a girl who looks a bit like the girl who was murdered.  She is nicknamed the Black Dahlia, and it's pronounced DAY-LEE-AAHH.  Hartnett and Wahlberg do play the two cops, Fire and Ice or whatever their names are. Their names both begin with B I think.  Anyway, it's been in the pipeline for quite a while now, and will doubtless be cack.  No LA Confidential, that's fo' sho'.

      I can't make that link work.  I forgot to do my transfers before the Czech Republic game, that pisses me off.  I have been in court again today, laying down the law at some mofos.  Seems I'll be doing the same thing for much of this week.  Now somebody tell me when Andy's Wedding Anniversary is.

      after getting back to the flat in time for the second half of the czech game, i thought i'd best get to bed early or i'd be as sick as a dog this morning. so i went to bed after fantasy football, and read for a bit, then turned off the light, lay back, and immediately felt incredibly sick.  spent several hours going to and from the bathroom feeling like i was going to throw up, then not throwing up.  i AM bitter today. i could have spent that time playing pes with a bucket in my lap, if i'd known.

      That would be the one...I find it pretty amusing that almost all the (I refrained putting a made up statistic in there in favour of a sweeping statement) Sugababe photos you see are of the two fit ones.

      Is it "Ku Klux Klan"?  I can never remember, but it's a stupid name anyway.  I just got a free copy of the Scissor Sisters' album.  Maybe that will help me decide if I like them or not.  Where the giddy fuck is manx? And why doesn't my RSS feed work properly?  My Blur-esque quote from earlier was intentional by the way.  I'm going to try and work in an Oasis one later.

      I couldn't agree more.  When you pinch a girl's bum they should smile and possibly give you a flash of their undies, and when you pounce on them and try to snog them, they should not only let you, but be extremely grateful for the attention afterwards.

      Interweb is important it has to be said.   Saturday night was good fun...me, 3 other guys, 15 or so fit women.  In a club being molested by 4 women at once was awesome. Which brings me around to an important point.  When I'm in a club and grab random women, a slap can be expected or perhaps a firm kick in the junks.  Women need to be more open to the occasional grab and squeeze/forced kiss/love making...that way there would be fewer rapes and less people in jail.

I went to the pub at lunch time and it was great.  There's a new bar maid there who is the fittest bird I have clapped eyes on for a very long time.  I'm going again tomorrow lunch time, at which point I will be asking for a detailed copy of her work roster.  If she often works there between the hours of 11-6, I'm going to have to find a different job I think, so I have more time to camp at her door step.  I think "camp" was the wrong choice of word there. Perhaps not.

      Eeeexcellent. My boss is out all day, and the only person who sits behind me has just left early, meaning no-one can see me surfing the interweb all afternoon.  To be specifimic, Fonz, I now live on Warwards Lane, which is the other side of Raddlebarn from Hubert and Tiverton and that.  I work almost in Aston, the other side of Aston University, about 15 mins from the city centre. It is a shitty area. If this were SimCity, it would definitely be light industrial, with quite a lot of black buildings.

      It happens to us all occasionally.  I've used and configured Apache/Tomcat, IIS and Resin, and I have to say IIS comes out as the worst of the three in my opinion.  It's arguably easier to configure than Tomcat, and definitely easier than Resin, but other than that it sucks ass. It's not very powerful and, like ASP, I find it a bit clumsy.  I like to Be In Control.  Plus IIS probably isn't very secure.  That Onion article from 1969 is pretty funny this week.

      Right I see we need a proper compski here and I'm the properest I know.  Step 1: Stop using Outlook and ie cause there insecure and generally shit. Use Mozilla Firefox(browser) and Thunderbird(mail client) especially Firefox cause it has tabbed browsing, blockes all popup adverts and wont let spyware on to your machine via activex. Thunderbird doesn't auto open virus ridden attachments either. There both basically great.  Part the second: Compski as I am I still cant love linux. You'll spend a week finding the text files you need to edit to make things work then another week figuring out how to edit them. Everythings painful and even though you think your learning things youll forget it instantly and besides what youve learnt wont work on another distro which brings me to the next thing about Linux. Choose your distro wisely. I reconmend SuSE cause it has some graphical tools for configuring things. But overall you may well be better off with winxp and and windows apache client.  As for web servers Apache and Tomcat are ok but you still have the annoying impenetrable text file based config files.  Ive never used IIS I suspect its insecure but easy to config.  Dave with Yoav you should get him on one of those reality shows where they dump someone in a jungle and get them to fend for themselves. When he cant use his psychic link to Zodiacs Wobu slaves to sort out the festering snake bite on his leg he will either learn really quickly how to organize his own life or you wont have a problem with him any more! I bet we can forge a will signing his flat over to you.

      Yeah, this free stuff is all well and good, but it's mainly geard towards the use of Java and JSP.  So if that's what you're after, then go for it.  If you're only after regular HTML, then anything's good for that.  Otherwise, you could get some .NET action going on, but that's probably far from free.  I mean, hosting .NET is free I think (?), but the tools for developing it aren't.  Then there's PHP.

      resin be free for personal use and small companies, but not if you're the size of zodiac. that's why we had to switch to tomcat. that and the fact that resin can't handle struts.  turns out that wobu's insurance has also expired, and he has no vehicle registration documentation. the mind boggles...
     
    
</post>

<date>14,July,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      Right, I'll shower tou with my opinions and gloss over the facts:  I use Outlook for my regular mail, and I think it's more secure than Outlook Express.  However, you can't use it to connect to hotmail, so I use outlook express to connect to one of my hotmail accounts. I have no idea if it's secure or not.  As for servers, I have no preference for operating system.  Linux is supposed to be good and free, and is probably worth trying out at least.  Is this going to be a server for serving up web pages and the like then?  Have you any idea what sort of site you want and what technology you're going to use?  If you're after free stuff, I guess Tomcat and Apache are the way to go, but in my opinion, Resin is still a better server.  Not sure if it's free or not for personal use.  That's not much help, is it?

      I have some right proper compsci questions, the answers to which I can't be arsed to find myself. So do my thinking for me.  Question the first: Is Outlook Express still riddled with security problems, or is it okay to use now? I remember Microsoft recommended you didn't use it to connect to Hotmail, but that was years ago now.  Question the second: I've realised that I have enough old computer parts to build another machine, so I was thinking of putting together an interweb server. I remember people talking about Linux and Apache. Is that still the best (free) way?

Why can't the Mecha-Zinch stump up?  Also, I suck pretty bad at that golf game, but not as badly as Ross. I do pronounce it balls though. If that were a real golf course, I don't think anyone would ever get round it.  Not without golf balls that float and a decent boat anyway.

      shaddap youse - you're older than me. well, you look like you are. it's the hairy godzilla face, you see.  i'm accidentally a bit hungover today. i should probably go to angel this evening and shout in damo's ear for a couple of hours. that'll help.   a story about woab's car once upon a time, woab went to new york, leaving his car in the garage of our building. his dad came up to me at work on monday and asked me to bring in the car keys and the widget to open the garage doors so that they could take his car to get a service in his absence. fair enough, i suppose - i brought the keys in on tuesday.  yesterday morning, the bloke who's sort of the official driver for the office came over to my desk and asked me for the address and instructions of how to get there etc., as he'd been told to spend his working day getting yove's car sorted out. fair enough, i muttered, and gave him directions.  he came and found me again at about 4 yesterday afternoon. it turns out that he'd taken the yovemobile to the garage, and there they had discovered a few things:    he'd been driving around on a flat tyre, and had destroyed it, meaning a new tyre   he'd also been driving around with the emergency tyre on another wheel, left over from the puncture before last, for probably a month   his rear brake pads were 95% worn through   one of the rear wheel bearings was cracked and buggered - the entire hub had to be replaced   his MOT was two months out of date   he'd had no road tax for over a month    the total bill for the work done, including road tax and vat, was £880-odd.  fair enough, i hissed through gritted teeth. someone has to take care of these things...

It was pretty good.  It reminded me of all the other Vegas movies I've seen, like Swingers and Very Bad Things, but most of all it reminded me of Leaving Las Vegas.

      I saw a telly programme a few weeks ago called 'Train Cops', or something, following Transit Police about their business. It went between stations all over the country, and showed some amusing national sterotypes.  In Lahndahn - some blokes are having a scrap on the platform, and when the Train Cops turn up, some woman goes mental and has to be arrested.  In Brum - some thieving scally nicks a woman's suitcase while pretending to help her carry it.  And, of course, in Glasgow - a skaghead is caught shooting up in the station toilets.

      yes, it is SQL. i have a grid of results 21 columns wide, and each column has its own query, as they all pull slightly differently filtered data from the same tables, with slightly different joins. the rows are generally, but not always, the same, is it's to do with attendance and processing figures from the zodiac remote offices - one count query per office per column, and some offices don't show up in every single one.  aaaanyway, i need to combine the individual queries into a single one, while keeping the data produced separated with different column headings. i'm thinking that i'll union each resultset with the next, keeping the SQL distinct, but in order to union two queries they have to have the same column headings, which means that i'll have to fabricate column headers on each query for all but the column that is being populated.  of course, just to make things interesting, the queries are being built out of little modular blocks of my own creation, as (because of the different ranks involved) each query is effectively run 3 times, with one line different in the Where clause but everything else the same. so the whole thing needs to generate in a loop.  here's an example of one of the queries - not too complicated:  /*GET NEW APPLICANT OFFICERS*/ select i.description, count(*) new_applicant_officers  from persons p, identifiers i, persons_history ph  where p.persons_rank in ('CPT','C/O','2/O','3/O','C/E','1/E','2/E','3/E','EE1','EE2','EE3') 	  and p.source_code in ('BUL','BOT','OZR','EST','ODS','TPI','LAT','BEO','CNT','DIA','ESP','BEG','TGL','DON') 	  and p.source_code = i.code 	  and i.identifier = 'SOURC' 	  and p.persons_code = ph.persons_code 	  and ph.status_code = 0 	  and to_char(ph.timestamp, 'YYYYMM') = ? group by p.source_code, i.description  and i need to combine it with the next one, which looks like this:  /*GET NEW JOINER OFFICERS*/ select i.description, count(*) new_joiner_officers  from persons_voyages pv, persons p, identifiers i  where p.persons_code = pv.persons_code 	  and pv.sign_off_date is null 	  and pv.joining_rank in ('CPT','C/O','2/O','3/O','C/E','1/E','2/E','3/E','EE1','EE2','EE3') 	  and p.source_code in ('BUL','BOT','OZR','EST','ODS','TPI','LAT','BEO','CNT','DIA','ESP','BEG','TGL','DON') 	  and p.source_code = i.code 	  and i.identifier = 'SOURC'   	  and to_char(pv.joining_date, 'YYYYMM') = ? 	  and not exists  	  	  (select * from persons_voyages pv2  		  where pv2.sign_off_date is not null  		  		and pv2.persons_code = p.persons_code)  group by p.source_code, i.description  and then five more like it. note how some of the tables are the same, making a standard join impossible without table aliasing, and i'd have to do it at least seven, and possibly 21 times. it's also worth noting that these two queries are in fact six, because each will be run three times (with different rank codes in the persons_rank collection).  so, wee man, help me.

We ran the nt_pass tool on it and changed the admin password and the user password, and saved all the changes.  And nothing seemed to have changed at all.  Hmmm.

      Killing Charlie is a fundemental part of any American child's education.&nbsp; The first time&nbsp;an American&nbsp;child wakes up screaming "They're in the trees...they're in the fucking trees" it's cause for celebration within the family.&nbsp; It's kind of like the Barmitzvah (if that's how it's spelt) in Judaism,&nbsp;the Coming of age celebrations in Hinduism/Sikhism or your first car bomb in Islam. &nbsp; They celebrate with hot dogs and bud beers...it's true (see what I did there)...MTV told me.

      Hmm, I don't think that's correct Fonz.    urlLink This  is a&nbsp;list of all the companies in the world making more than $100bn of revenues in a year. The top is Wal-Mart who make $266bn, which is around 140 billion quid. So I don't see anyone incurring as much cost as you have there.   Are you still working for the viagra people? They're raking in $45bn a year and spending around $32bn a year, which is around $60k a minute I think.

      Hmm, having  looked into it (I am very bored) I couldn't find anywhere a rating of just how large this company is, or how many employees it has worldwide even. But I did find out that it's sales income is about 30 billion dollars a year, which makes me think that damo's theory about the million pounds a minute thing being rubbish is not rubbish.  In summary then, Chris.

      well, it turns out that our pseudo-scottish snake-in-the-grass has been reading the tabloids the whole time. i think there should be an inquiry.  fonz, did ed mention that he and banksy are considering going for the on-line telegraph fanfoot this year? apparently you get a 18-man squad and that. it's supposubly better.  there was quite a good article on the bbc news web site last night about the bbfc and that. i agreed with it. although it quoted the professor of computer games at stafford university (or somesuch), which i thought devalued it a little.

      What was actually happening&nbsp;there Dave! - a cop in the background whispering into his walkie talkie... " We have one, I repeat we have one...eta to cell 1230.&nbsp; Good condition...mild bruising to left leg, good runner, one careful beating.&nbsp;" All the cops leave the streets and convene at the local nick.&nbsp; David Dickinson makes an Orange faced appearance and wanders around all the cells passing such comments as "There's a little chip here which may reduce it's value but&nbsp;its head will certainly look good mounted on the wall...a bargain at £30"...he then introduces two fresh out of training school cops.&nbsp; "There's a £100, you have half an hour to find some bargains!" "How will our amateurs do? Find out at the end of the program!" David then introduces a hardened cop..."So how long have you been in the business?" "Oh about 20 years"..."Anything caught your eye today?" "There's one in cell 3 with a fine set of teeth...it's going for about £30 quid...but is worth well over £60...imagine the fun you'd have putting your boot through those!" Two cops return, bright eyed and bushy tailed.&nbsp; Satsuma faced David turns to them "And what have you fellows picked up today then?" "Well, I've bought the one in cell 6 for £10...a bargain...come and look" David looks perplexed..."Oh deary deary me...sometimes you can't beat experience it has to be said...that looks like a half cast to me...you'll be lucky to make back half of what you paid at auction!" I can't be bothered to type anymore  &nbsp;

      i just saw three plain-clothes policemen take down a mugger on the opposite side of the street from me. there was lots of shouting, then they tackled him as he was running away. walkie-talkies and everything.  one of them just brought the car around. the mugger's sitting handcuffed on the pavement at the moment, and the bald copper keeps shouting "shut up! shut the fuck up" in his ear, and pushing him over.  it's like television. the whole neighbourhood's watching from its windows.

      80% of the work is done in 20% of the time. The other 20% of the work requires the remaining 80% of the time.  What that really means is that the easy stuff is easy to do, and the complicated stuff is usually not necessary. It's why when you're enjoying your work, people can see results, and when you're hating your work they keep asking you when they're going to see more results.  It's very handy because you can talk your way out of doing anything boring and time consuming.

Those buttons do need re-doing. The travel system will take a while to re-do, make sure they know that because otherwise they'll say to you, look, it was 80% of the way there, why is it taking so long? You should explain the 80-20 rule with some pictures and maybe a puppet.

      my guts have got some serious ache on. i think i can hear all the porcelain within a mile radius quailing.  i'm sure i have debbie does dallas somewhere. at least, debbie does dallas: the next generation. which is like the old one, but one of the characters is wearing tyre over his eyes.  yove: i've given up on my real work (re-creating the travel tables in the database) and i've started making some new buttons for the menu screens. i am king.

      Apparently, Lahndahn is the second most expensive city in the world, behind Tokyo. And Tokyo-ites have a much better quality of life. This must mean that anyone who lives in Lahndahn must be the very end of the bell. The donger, if you will.

      What I am learning in America:  It is a portion of National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster and US Marine Corps General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military installation  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?  GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?  GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?  GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're equipping them to become violent killers.  GENERAL REINWALD: Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?  The radio went silent and the interview ended.

      I'm here for another... 7 hours. Goddammit.  I went to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday with another guy from the office. We were shown around by a broker. It's a pretty amazing place. It's just this huge room (with american flags hanging on the walls) and 1366 people in it. Actually it's one huge room and a few smaller rooms next to it.   There are no chairs, and basically at the sides of the room stand people who wait by the phone to get buy and sell orders. They get a call to buy shares of whatever, and they relay it to the guy who then goes to do it. He walks to something called a "post" which is a free standing circle of computer monitors reaching a few meters high, with about 5 people inside the circle and 5 people outside. Each person in a post trades between one and ten or so companies, so there are lots of posts dotted aruond the room. So he says to the person outside the post, I want to buy these shares, and he points to someone else nearby and says he wants to sell them, let's negotiate a price and we're done.  Of course this is all very hectic and completely a waste of time. The NASDAQ does it all electronically and these guys know that they're doomed. Every one of them that I talked to gave me a speech on why their particular function couldn't properly be repliacted by a computer and why they can still "add value to their clients".   So it was interesting. People in the office are blaming me for the market being down today because I'm wearing a red shirt.

      Having spent 5 hours in the pub last night I came home to attempt something I have seen done on TV a few times.  After 1 hour, 5 flies and plenty of frustration I succeeded in attaching a small paper aeroplane via thin line to the back of a blue bottle fly.  It was a defining moment in my life and one I shall remember for years to come. My next effort will involve 5 or 6 flies with which I hope to stage some sort of Battle of Britain re-inactment.  It's amazing what interests you whilst drunk! Did you manage to find lexie in the end last night big 'un?

      How dare you drastically resize my image Dave.  How would you like it if I resized something of yours?  And there's is no point now telling me I got an invite when I quite clearly didn't, it's called lying and it's not cool.  Anyway for those of you wondering what other amusing place names I happened to find on my travels you can look  urlLink here.  The photos of Bummer's Hill are still unfortunately in my camera.  Dave did promise me some from the gay orgy he attended there last month, but has not been forthcoming with the goods.  I recommend the  urlLink original web site  also.

      Yes, I thought that about the translators earlier, until I realised that to translate Japanese to English, you'd need to enter the Japanese in kanji, or at least hiragana.  And I wouldn't say that fucking the Daily Mail is out of character at all. Although fucking the Daily Male would be more in character.  Ha de ha. Ha.

      I'm having a little trouble with this, as I can't view Japanese properly on my machine at work. I'll have a shufti when I get home.  However, I think the first one should be 'nan(i) da yo'. Nan, or sometimes nani, is 'what', 'da' is, informally, the existance of a thing, which isn't a verb in Japanese, and 'yo' adds emphasis at the end of a sentence. So it would be something like 'what (the hell) is that?', I think. 
     
    
</post>

<date>03,August,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      1st one depends on where the emphasis in your accent is...gentle it means "what the hell"...if you emphasise (phonetically) the "ooooo" bit at the end it become more like "what the fuck"  The second one is to commit severe "cunning linguist" on the mother "bitch" of your target.  By severe I mean getting the head down there and causing nastiness to come out.   Kani-Nabu-Chao-Chi-Bei is a phonetic equivalent of that in Chinese.  All though this one is for doing bad things to the dead relatives of your target...(cue: some tiresome jokes from fonz!) 
     
    
</post>

<date>03,August,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      well, the first thing is "what the hell?" or similar, and the second, i'm told, is the most offensive possible phrase in japanese.  start with looking up the kanji for "your mother's dead ancestors" and work backwards.

      s'welsh for ian. it is. anyway, i tole you on the tube that it was either ian or yoan, and you said you reckoned it was ewan. so i suppose we'll just have to kill each other.  ross, i've never seen my noise written down, i've only ever heard it, so i'm afraid that's the closest transliteration that i can manage.  go on, find the kanji now.

      Ikiru is the dictionary form, or present informal positive tense, of the verb to live, or exist. It looks like a group 2 (godan) verb, but is in fact a group 1 (ichidan), and so the present formal positive is ikirimasu, and not ikimasu as you'd expect.  Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair!  Ozy-who-dias?

      The A-Team one is a classic.  Does anyone fancy terrorising the Americans?  We could set off a bomb in one of their cities or something, you know, just for kicks.  We could then look on while they invade some African nation with oil as a result.

      I was going to play but I see Sawston Rovers isn't among one of the teams from which you can choose players.  As a result I cannot choose myself, Spence, Saggs, Shoulders, Steve, Sam Simon or Big Dave and so can't really see myself picking any team that will do very well.  Although last time I did come fourth having forgotten about my team three days into the season.

      Hmm, i'm unlikely to maintain interest all season enough to keep changing players every week.  anyway I picked all the same 11 i have in my work fantasy team then i added 7, which gives me a pretty balanced squad anyway.  do i need to be added to a mini leage then?

      That was my thinking, until I realised I could afford more than 11 really good players.  The trick is, you can select players for Saturday AND Sunday games, so you can get all 18 of your players to play each week if you get it right.  But if seven of them are bollocks, you'll only get 11 of them playing.

      I'd also quite like it if there were medics who ran around wiping paint off for you - If they manage it within 30 seconds you live...obviously this is a shit idea but it would allow me to shout "Reviiive me" as well as the statutory "I neeeed Ammo"

      As I lack the skill and know how of those that play paint ball all the time the only real chance I had of victory against a team of profs last year was to purchase a shedload of ammo.  Fed up with losing, on the last game myself and three friends spent around £30 each on ammunition.  We were protecting the base...we spent the whole game firing continuously...there's nothing like hearing 4 or 5 of the opposition shouting "You'll run out of ammo soon" from behind a tree then 5 minutes later see them make a last ditch charge into a hail of gunfire. Next time I hope to discover the No_Clipping Mode so I can run through trees.  I don't think I'll bother with God_Mode though as it will probably make it all a bit too easy.

      I'll have you know I was a fucking ninja in one paintball game, when I single-handedly stormed a temple and took out four bastards, and then got some stirling backup from Wee Dave and his sister, and we took out another two or three.  Of course, when I got shot and went back to the elimination zone, there were only three opposing players there. You do the math.

      Dave, apparently you are an Edinburgh virgin and your going for the first time with Billy!  I must warn you when me and Patrick went up there for a few days we got pissed on the plane on the way up and didn't return to sobriety until at least twelve hours after we'd crossed south of the border.  This was mainly due to Bartram showing off his enhanced student lifestyle where if he wasn't at the radio station he was either in an establishment that specialised in the sale of alcohol or at home where his fridge contents consisted solely of Stella, Vodka and Cranberry Juice!  Plus you are going for some Whiskey tasting do!

      I've played it for about 7 hours now in an optimum environment of small dark room encrusted with speakers on my own and the more I play it the more boring it gets. There is literaly no variety - all the rooms look the same the monsters are dull and very very stupid. The weapons are crap and its not scary. Its pretty but not ridiculously so and it really is a big tech demo to make people licence the engine. As such it should be free and you shouldn't buy it. Just download the fucker and get bored with it and imagine what companies will do with the engine.  So there.
