       Finaly, you can see the words on my blog! Phedra, most of the text was red, it's just that the Background sucked. Tell me what you think of it. I think Nick and I went Ok for the games thing, I'm not sure     Later    The MonkeyMan is back, and after looking at everyones blogs, I think I can say that hardly anyone is getting on and posting. A few people, maybe, but hardly anyone.    Now that that is over with, When Nick and I got to the game thing, there were heaps of people there. It was nerve wracking, because there was no way of knowing who was at or above your standard. In the waiting room, there was this guy that came over to look at our game. Neither of us knew him, so it was pretty wierd, but , you know, kinda cool that someone we didn't know came over to have a look. There was this girl infront of us who was playing "Happy Lands", so some of the girls in our class aren't the only crazy ones (LOL).     I wish more people would comment on my blog, because I put so much effort into it. If I don't get 5 Comments by Tuesday, I will start posting in Igpay Atinlay.     So, enjoy! Only 5 comments, eoplepay!    The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

       Guess what! I had to sign off at about 5:00PM, so here is everything from then 'till now. I went swimming. My GOD! there was this crzy little **** that kept yelling at me, so I kicked him alot. It was fun. Then I watched Comedy Inc. FUNNY!!! Then I went to sleep. Today, we had sport. it was alright. Then Textiles. I got my Machine licence, and I found about 50 pins for Ms Sciacca, but that was it. So now I am posting and that is it. The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

       Well, first I woke up, (insert everything I do every day to 9:00 AM)  The I went to the staffroom to practice a piece of music with Ms Mc...Kechnie(?), and that went really well. BTW, I'm doing this post from E-Mail, not blogger. You can do that by going to the settings tab, then the E-Mail button. It will have something called Mail-To-Blogger Address, with something like: "neb_thims.(empty space for secret word)@blogger.com" then, you E-Mail your post to that address, and it will be posted, I think.   English was alright, and the task looks interesting, despite the fact that I have no idea What is going on. Then TEXTILES. I can't really complain. Yet... BAHBAHBAH!  R-e-c-e-s-s, I performed with Ms McKechnie(?), and everyone applauded. DOUBLE MATH was really fun. I like Math, and Mr Arayne, despite the general opinion. I'm always going against the opinion. HEHEHE.  Lunch, I went to the Library, and played chesss with Hoang. See if you can guess who won. I'll tell you next time. In Science, we had a great discussion about the meaning of existance, cut short by Ms Stevenson wanting to talk about Eclipses and stuff. I can't blame her, though.  Chess in period 6 was the best! I won against... Scott...Anderson(?) 4 Move Checkmate. Easy!  So now I am at home, and writing on this blog. What else to write? Nothing? Ok.  The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

       I mean, if you want a DVD player, then get a PlayStation 2 or an X Box. Granted, there are some good games on PS2 and X Box, but GameCube is all about games, AND(!) can connect to the GameBoy Advance

The awards will be decided on Wednesdays, amd If anyone wins, then E-Mail me if you want the code.  urlLink mailto:Neb_thims@hotmail.com   urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail69.html  This is really funny if you know the series (though completly irrelevent to MOTW) I found Josh C's Blog, and you all should have a look, because he has done some really clever things with it.

      BOOYAH!! DOUBLE TEXTILES IN THE COMPUTER ROOM!!! Anywho, I'm just so bored with school, thanks to Chloe who said I was the nicest in the class :-D! I didn't get near enough sleep last night, even though I slept in for half an hour... and I went to sleep at 10:30, and woke up at 7:30... Sleep is good...  Later  I'm sad now... No one is sitting next to this sad little monkey.  Perhaps if I was more, um, with... the... uh, helping... people would sit next to me... The only people who are nice to me are Ben Hackett, Theo and Ryo. Yet, all is not lost. I'm playing defend your castle at arcadetown.com, and I'm up to level 11 or 12. BOOYAH! Comments about my predicament would be nice... The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

      We all see Google as an internet search engine. But, is Google much more than it seems? What is Google? Google is a search engine, ran by 2 increibly smart people. It also includes a shopping page, an image search , forums and news.  Thats all we see on the main page.  Behind the scenes, there is E-Mail (GMail) and our good friend, Blogger. I think it is all a maniacal plot to take over the world! The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

      I don't know what is happening at school. I'm so out of the loop. Could someone (trustworthy) fill me in on what is going on?  I woke up, did wash, eat, brush, school things (I'm TIRED!) The I had band, and um, Lots of people wern't there, Only 1 clarinet, and we played good. Then Mats and Italian, nothing eventful except Tom coming in at 10:10, then R-e-c-e-s-s, then, um, Extended pastoral (WASTE OF TIME) then English (lots of fun) . At L-u-n-c-h i went to a Hockey meeting for field hockey (that made sense), then I did Computer Tech stuff, and then Music lesson, lost of fun, then T-E-X-T-I-L-E-S. Bah. Not much else, bag was heavy today, my back hurts, Maybe I'll go lie down. Lots of people were absent, probably due to Rock Eistefford.

      Stewie : "Hello mother." Lois : "Well, hi there Sweety." Stewie : "You know Mother, life is like a box of chocolates [he presents herwith a box], you never know what you’re going to get, your life however is morelike a box of active grenades! [the box has grenades in it] Now I offer you onelast chance for deliverance- return my mind control device, or be destroyed." Lois : "Oh, you just want your toy back. Okay, here ya go honey." Stewie : "Yes, well, Victory is mine! [ Walks away with the device into thedining room. A crash sound is heard] Ahhhhhh! Damn you all!" See that? That is the best line in Family Guy, one of my favourite shows. Another is: Glen : "Hey, who wants to play “Drink the Beer”?" Peter : "Right here!" Glen : "Heh, you win!" Peter : "All right, what do I win?" Glen : "Another beer!" Peter : "Oh, I’m going for the high score." Glen : "Well, actually Charlie has the high score." Charlie : [with his pants down facing the inside of a grandfather clock] "Heyman, your clock won’t flush." HAHAHA! That is classic humour, in it's finely refined form. "Hey man, your clock won't flush."  Oh my god! Family Guy Rocks!

      Thank you again to Lachlan, and to Tom, for posting comments. I'm down to oneway ommentcay, ownay! So, how did people go with their... Um, Games things? Like I said earlier, we went OK, but could have gone better if we had the "flowchart", whatever the hell that was. Anyways, I've had a boring weekend, with the exception of the games thing, and I'm almost looking forward to school, except I haven't finished my Science. Oh well. Now, I think I have some crap jokes for the world...  Ethical Dilemma A lawyer charged a man $1,000 for legal services. The man paid him in cash with crisp new $100 bills. After the client left, the lawyer discovered that two bills had stuck together -- he'd been overpaid by $100. The ethical dilemma for the lawyer: Should he tell his partner?  Bush and Osama Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and which ever site's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female Dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 " thick and nobody could get near. When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistan dog. When the cages were opened up,the Dachshund came out of it's cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund -- but, when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama's dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, "We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves." "That's nothing,", said Bush. "We had Michael Jackson's plasticsurgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog."  George and Moses George W. Bush, in an airport lobby, noticed a man in a long flowingwhite robe with a long flowing white beard and flowing white hair. Theman had a staff in one hand and some stone tablets under the other arm. George W. approached the man and inquired, "Aren't you Moses." The man ignored George W. and stared at the ceiling. George W. positioned himself more directly in the man's view and askedagain, "Aren't you Moses". The man continued to peruse the ceiling. George W. tugged at the man's sleeve and asked once again, "Aren't youMoses". The man finally responded in an irritated voice, "Yes I am". George W. asked him why he was so uppity and the man replied, "The lasttime a bush spoke to me I ended up spending forty years in thewilderness".  The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith

      No, I don't have any new winners. But, if you have won the MOTW award, then post this in a post (LoL, grammar sucks): &lt;img src="http://www.brunswick.vic.edu.au/home/smi02/MOTW.bmp"&gt; and you will have the MOTW award on your blog!  School is really good, though I feel I havn't been spending enough time with my old friends (Josh, Tom, Luther, David, Hoang) and more time with my new friends (Too many to list) Speaking of lists, if you want to put a links list on your blog, then type this somewhere on your template: &lt;h2&gt;Links list&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themonkeyman.blogspot.com"&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eightshub.blogspot.com"&gt;Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Then add new: &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eightshub.blogspot.com"&gt;Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; for more links  Ben "The Amazing MonkeyMan"

      I think there is a difference in talking to people with blogger. You can talk to people that are hundreds of kilometers away. Just look at newt and I. We met on blogger, and post comments on each others blogs, and it is fun. Talking to people can be better than looking at a computer screen, but for talking to people that are not near you, then blogger is better. Ben "The Amazing MonkeyMan"
