      I started this blog on May 22, 2004 based on a suggestion from my boyfriend, John (quite the computer geek). I have been wanting to do this for a while for several reasons: first and foremost, I think I have a rare form of Alzheimer's that affects young people. I am sick and tired of forgetting when and where significant events in my life occurred. This blog will allow me to keep a timeline of important (and not so important) events in my life. Second, John and I recently moved to California and I want to be able to share pictures and thoughts with family and friends back home. And finally, I just think it's really cool, so hope you like it!

      So I was raiding the bargain bin at Books, Inc. (you can find some really good stuff in there)and I came across a book called "Scientific American's The Big Idea". It contains the best (and the most ludicrous) discoveries, inventions, theories, etc. made in the last 150 years that were featured in "Scientific American". Pretty interesting stuff: Alfred Nobel invented nitro-glycerin and dynamite. The first Ferris Wheel could carry 1,440 people at one time. The sweetening agent, saccharin, is made from coal tar and is 230 times sweeter than cane sugar.  Also started "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". So far so good. Other than reading, I haven't been doing a whole lot. Attempting to find a new job. It sucks. This weekend John and I are planning to attend the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade to show our support. I'm sure my family wouldn't approve but I guess that's the way it goes. I can't wait! I think it will be a lot of fun.

      John and I went saw Dodgeball: freaking hilarious. After, we went nuts at Best Buy and ended up buying The&nbsp; Last Samurai, U Turn, and The Talented Mr. Ripley. The Last Samurai was a phenomenal movie, beautiful in every way, the epitome of what films should be. U Turn is your typical Oliver Stone movie, trippy, very well acted, with great cinematography. The Talented Mr. Ripley was a good movie and made me want to move to Italy immediately. Been reading a couple books lately: I, Lucifer by Glen Duncan is a great read taken from Satan's point of view of the modern world and tells his side of the story. Also been reading What Color Is Your Parachute? which is&nbsp;supposedly the best job-hunting book ever written. &nbsp;

      My brother and Elizabeth came to visit this past week and brought me the best present ever... my mommy. I was under the impression that she wasn't able to come because she couldn't afford it but my brother was sweet enough to pay for her plane ticket. We did the whole tourist thing in The City. Just a preview: The Presidio, The Exploratorium, Fisherman's Wharf, a Bay cruise, The Castro, Chinatown, Haight-Ashbury, The Asian Art Museum, and The Legion of Honor. We had a lot of fun despite not having a lot of money to spend. Overall, it was a great visit and I'm so grateful to have been able to see them for a week.

      So ended up not going to the Gay Pride Parade, would've liked to. I did see a recruiter this week about finding a new job. I haven't heard anything back yet. My brother and his fiance are coming to visit in a couple of weeks. I can't wait to see them, it's been almost a year since I saw them last. I just hope I haven't found a job by then so I can sight see with them. Then again, we're desperate for $$$$ so at this point I can't be picky. It'll just be nice to have them around for a week.  Still haven't seen "Fahrenheit 9/11" yet. Can't wait, Michael Moore is a personal hero of mine. Recently, I was watching "NOW with Bill Moyers" on PBS and they did an investigative piece on Congress's paychecks. Did you know that every year Congress gets an automatic pay raise? A member of Congress now makes somewhere around $150,000/year. Not to mention hefty pension and 401K plans. It's sad to know that half of the people in this country don't have access to healthcare but members of Congress don't have to answer to anybody when it comes to the taxpayer's money paying their salaries.

      What the hell, man? Where do the years go? It seems as I get older the faster the days go by. Or maybe it's because I haven't worked in a while. Then again, I know that if I was working, especially if I didn't like the job, the days would be dragging on forever. Minutes would seem like hours. Been there, done that, wanted to slit my wrists with a butter knife. Well, been working on a stem cell research article for John's new political blog. It's coming along ok but there's just too much information to sift through. I need to make an outline, figure out what key points I want to make. Slowly but surely.... I had a second interview today for a concierge job at a ritzy apartment complex in Mountain View. Not exactly why I spent 6 years in school but it could turn into something cool. I want to learn more about real estate and property management anyway so it can't hurt. The interview went okay, could've been better, could've been worse. What sucks is that I have to wait 2 weeks for an answer. In the meantime, I hope to secure at least one more offer. From where, I don't know but hopefully I'll find another potentially good job.
