      So no one&nbsp;can answer my question in the previous post?&nbsp; Is it because no one has an answer?&nbsp; Or that people came up with the same answer as me and&nbsp;are afraid to post it?&nbsp; The answer I have is, of course, death.&nbsp; Death is the only way to wake up from life.   Or maybe people just don't care anymore.&nbsp; At first, people were like, "ooh, Howard is fucked up!&nbsp; Let's see how fucked up he gets."&nbsp; But now, it's like, "okay, I know Howard is sad and depressed, and it's getting BOOOOOOORING!&nbsp; Do something new!"&nbsp; Oh well, only around four people post&nbsp;stuff anyway, and maybe five people actually read this crap.&nbsp;

      How do I wake up from the nightmare if the nightmare is my life?

      I was with her in a room. Talking. She called me "cream and a half." I got angry, Threw a pen on the floor and stormed out. She chased after me, Gave me a kiss, and apologized. I kissed her back. We kissed. Then I pulled back. "What's wrong?" she asked. "I want to pinch myself," I said jokingly, "This can't be real." I pinched. I woke up. I cried.  "I only remember two kisses - the first and the last. The first, with my love and the last, with death. The first brought happiness and the last relief!" -Srijit Prabhakaran

      So I went out drinking and smoking with a friend last night.&nbsp; Isn't smoking inside a business illegal in California?&nbsp; Anyway, this place did let us smoke inside (Go Korean bars!).&nbsp; I got sick and threw up, and I didn't even drink that much.&nbsp; That's why I don't like to drink.&nbsp; Did the whole experience make me think less about her?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The whole time I was thinking would she care if I'm sick?&nbsp; Would she care if I'm throwing up?&nbsp; Well we spent about two and a half hours there, then I drove back kind of woozy.&nbsp; It's fun to drive under the influence because death is just around the corner.&nbsp; Would she care if I'm driving drunk?&nbsp; Would she care if I get in a car accident and die?

      She told me a lot of things about herself, I guess things she normally doesn't tell others.&nbsp; She has been through a lot of stuff in her life.&nbsp; A LOT.&nbsp; It pisses me off that I couldn't do anything about it, I wish I did something......ANYTHING......to help better her life.&nbsp; Now, I want to be there for her if she needs anything, I want to be there to protect her, I want her to have a good life...&nbsp; I want to know what's going on in her life and to know if she's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can't do anything about anything and I just hate myself for that.&nbsp; I FUCKING HATE MYSELF!!!&nbsp; I need to go burn some stuff now.....   &nbsp;

      She doesn't want to see me, she doesn't want to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;me.&nbsp; That makes me extremely sad, so please, don't tell me&nbsp;I'm not a loser.&nbsp; I'm the biggest loser there is, you can't persuade me otherwise.&nbsp; Yet, somewhere in my mind, I'm still thinking, maybe it's not that she doesn't want to talk to me, it's that she can't.&nbsp; Maybe she got real sick and has been in the hospital or something.&nbsp; That's why I haven't heard anything from her, not even a "don't ever talk to me again."&nbsp; Yeah, I'm really pathetic..........&nbsp; But if she really is sick or hurt, I'd rather have her hate me and not want to talk to me than to have her be injured.&nbsp; I don't know if this entire thought process makes sense to anyone.

      Wow, yesterday sure was a shitty night.&nbsp; I thought the VP was dead and I was ready to follow.&nbsp; It felt like I had a deadline to meet as I frantically searched for ways to kill myself painlessly.&nbsp; I was met with either sites that told me why I shouldn't do it, or sites that had stupid ways of suiciding, such as using a chainsaw.&nbsp; I ain't gonna chainsaw myself to death.&nbsp; Nor will I hang myself.&nbsp; I think hanging is the scariest death for people to discover.&nbsp; Chainsaw death, bullet death, razor death, they're just messy and stinky.&nbsp; But seeing a guy hanging from the ceiling, eyeballs popping out and tongue hanging out,&nbsp;that's freaky stuff.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, all the while I was searching, I was thinking how my death would have absolutely no effect on her life.&nbsp; That's really depressing, when your death has no effect on the person you care about.&nbsp; Just dust off her shoulders.&nbsp; Thoughts like those made me really, extra, mega, super, very, sad EX plus alpha gold.&nbsp; I think I would've killed myself yesterday if I had been more prepared.&nbsp; So a lesson for y'all kids, always be prepared.  &nbsp;  Well, it turned out that the VP is still alive.&nbsp; That's good, I suppose, maybe, I mean, we ARE in a Suicide Club.&nbsp; I gave a call to the VP last night and left him a message, which he responded the same night.&nbsp; Good stuff.&nbsp; I remember this one time, I thought she was hurt/sick/dead and I kept on calling her to let me know if she's okay, and she never did.&nbsp; Even others told me I shouldn't have called.&nbsp; I was like, "why shouldn't I call if I'm worried about her safety?"&nbsp; Anyway, turned out she just didn't want to talk to me.&nbsp; I guess the joke was on me, everyone knew about it except for me, I got punk'd.&nbsp; It's always fun when you care and worry about someone and they don't want you to care about them.&nbsp; So I got an e-mail&nbsp;from her like days later, saying how I shouldn't have bothered her.&nbsp; I'm such a loser, asshole, jerk, idiot, jackass, schmo, numskull, ninny, and so on.&nbsp; I've said it before and I'll say it again, I hate my life, and VP, you have it good, and I want to see her again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I on this Earth?&nbsp; Everyday I grow more and more disgusted with myself.&nbsp; Okay, time for me to go smoke and&nbsp;then cigarette burn myself.  &nbsp;  I'm running out of quotes, send me some quotes people!   Oh for those of you who like Punk'd, here's a video of Justin Timberlake on SNL doing Punk'd:&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.jengajam.com/r/snl-justin-timberlake   &nbsp;  She's Ashton Kutcher and she's awesome!

      Isn't the internet suppose to be the greatest place for information?&nbsp; How come I can't find any information on how to kill myself painlessly?&nbsp; All they have is how to prevent suicide.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;want that shit!&nbsp; I'm trying to find pill combinations that can guarantee death without pain.&nbsp; Okay, some might call it wussy, but I call it clean, and yeah, I'm a wuss.&nbsp; Can anyone help me out on this?&nbsp; Maybe some Tylenol mixed with Mr. Clean?&nbsp; My vice president hasn't gotten back to me yet, and there's a chance he's a step ahead of me now.&nbsp; I need to catch up.&nbsp; Come on you smart chem people, help me!&nbsp;  &nbsp; "The game of life is hard to play, I'm going to lose it anyway, The losing card I'll someday lay, So this is all I have to say, ...

      On my way back from San Francisco today, I almost died.&nbsp; While on the Bay Bridge, 3 cars in front of me crashed into each other, one of them into the wall of the tunnel, and I was able to stop in time and swerve by.&nbsp; That made me think.&nbsp; It's weird, I want to die, but my natural instinct and muscle reflexes made me swerve.&nbsp; Maybe it's because if I did run into them, it would be my fault because I was the car behind.&nbsp; But if I had died, it would've been a lonely death.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fitting end for my life.&nbsp; The experience also made me want to call her and see her even more.&nbsp; I don't want to die without saying goodbyes, not that she cares, but I do.&nbsp; Waaaaa.....I miss talking to her!&nbsp; Set me up with an appointment Jason!

      Waaa... couldn't sleep last night.&nbsp; I want to see her and I want to talk to her!&nbsp; This sucks!&nbsp; I want to give her a big hug but I can't&nbsp; :___(&nbsp; God I hate myself.&nbsp; To Mr. Vice President of the Suicide Club: You have it good.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There's a kendo tournament this Sunday, for those participating, if you want to cheer me up, win first place for me.  &nbsp;  Good news count = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep up the good work guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;  For those of you who were too lazy to look up the translations for that other post, here it is, enjoy: &nbsp; I feel uneasy.  I feel uneasy.  I'm afraid of being hated by everyone.  I'm afraid of being hurt.  But I'm more afraid of hurting other people.  But I end up hurting (them).  I hurt the people I like/love.  That's why I won't like people.  That's why I hurt myself. &nbsp; Because I'm scared.  Because I hate (myself) very much. &nbsp; I mustn't come to like (other people).  That's why I hurt myself. Tenderness is extremely cruel.  If I yield my heart, I will be broken/destroyed.  If our hearts touch, that person will be hurt. So, I have no recourse but to be broken/destroyed.  No recourse but to return to nothing. &nbsp; Let's return to nothing.  Let's return to nothing.  That is the place filled with tenderness.  That is the place without the pain of truth.  The place without wavering of the heart. &nbsp; Let's return to nothing.  Let's return to nothing.  Let's return to nothing.  Let's return to nothing. &nbsp;

      Great, so no one has anything good to tell me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess y'all's lives suck too, just not as hard as mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on guys, mass suicide, let's go, it'll be fun. &nbsp; So gas prices are going up,&nbsp;bridge&nbsp;tolls have just gone up, and cigarettes are around $4 a pack!&nbsp; God damn it!&nbsp; Anybody know a good place to get cigarettes cheap?&nbsp; I can't be driving out to Rohnert Park everyday, even though that's what I did when I was working there.&nbsp; And also, any recommendation for cigarette brands?&nbsp; I don't really like Marlboro that much, but it's relatively cheap and&nbsp;a lot of people smoke it.&nbsp; I want to switch brands, so give me some input on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Can someone please tell me why I should get up everyday and live?  What is my motivation?  Because I really don't know.  Are there any incentive in doing anything if there's no reason for living?  Someone help me out here, thanks.  Hey by the way, to all suicide clubbers, I don't know about GGB jump anymore.  That sounds painful and it'll draw too much attention.  I'm a shy guy, I think sleeping pills would be better.  Less pain too.  Let me know your thoughts on that.

      Another dreadful day.  I just want to clarify a few things.  I don't hate her, I'm still in love with her, and that's why it hurts so bad and why my life is miserable.  If I hate her, it would be so much easier to just forget about her.  I don't hate her, I only hate myself.  I'm stupid for thinking I could actually hook up with her.  I'm a total loser and I'm a bum.  It's no wonder she chose someone else.  I hate myself so much that I want to hurt myself.  So FYI, that is one of the reasons why I need to smoke, to stop myself from doing something really stupid.    Well, I have my citizenship test tomorrow, but my mind is so far off it, I don't know if I can pass.  Maybe I should just fail and then get deported.  Hopefully the plane will crash and I die.  If I don't die, maybe I can end up on a deserted island so I can think about all the stupid things I did.  But there won't be any cigarette or alcohol on the island, that can be a problem.  "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source.  It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing." -Anais Nin   P.S. they won't actually deport me if I fail, but it's good to dream. P.P.S.  the suicide club is off to a great start, anybody else want to sign up?  So far we're looking at Golden Gate Bridge as the location :)

      Where is the Devil to offer you trades when you need him?  If the Devil walks up to me now and offers me a trade of every 1 year of my life for 30 seconds with her, I would do it.  Suppose I have a good 40 years left in me, that will give me a good 1200 seconds, which equals 20 minutes.  Sweet trade in my opinion.  I'd rather spend 20 minutes with her than to live 40 years alone and miserable.  But where is the Devil???  Maybe he doesn't exist, and if he doesn't exist, then maybe God doesn't exist.

      Someone once said "you cannot love others until you learn to love yourself."  Not true, because the thing is, you cannot love yourself if others don't love you.  So I've been doing a lot of thinking, she is probably out there having fun and living the good life.  I guess that's good in a way, at least she's happy, that makes my misery seem kind of (just a tad) worth it.  Because if she's sad and I'm sad, then the whole situation is stupid.  But if she's happy, then all the pain I felt was for something, not nothing.  However, the happier she is, the sadder I am.  The happier she is, the worse I feel about myself.  Does that make sense?  I guess love doesn't make sense.

      Okay apparently people don't believe that I smoke now or that they don't realize I smoke now.  So here it is, I smoke, mostly Marlboro Light and sometimes Blackstone Cherry.  Here's how it started.  As you all know, I was miserable and depressed.  I believe there are 3 stages, first the smoke/drink stage, 2nd the cut/burn/self mutilation stage, and finally the suicide stage.  At the time, it was hard for me to drink because I was working and I have to wake up at 6 everyday and work for 11 hours.  However, it was very convenient for me to smoke because I was walking around all day.  My territory then was Rohnert Park and I got to know the owner of this cigarette shop and he was hooking me up with Marlboro Lights for $3 a pack!  $3!!  I challenge anybody to find another store that sell them that cheap.  Also with smoking, I can easily jump to the 2nd stage by burning myself with either the lighter or the cigarette itself, whereas I can't go to stage 2 from drinking.  Well maybe I can break the bottle and cut myself or something, but that seems like a lot of work.  Interesting enough, I've thought about stage 2, but smoking actually calms me out of stage 2.  Yay smoking!  Early death is good.  By the way, for people commenting, please write your name so I know who is actually responding.  Thanks.

      It has come to my attention that only two people have posted on this site.  That means people are either not reading or don't care.  Since I sent out an e-mail inviting people to read my blogs, and this site info is on my AIM profile and another person's profile, it must be that people don't care.  That's the story of my life, people not caring.  A true testament of how wonderful my life is.  But thank you, to the two people who actually care.

      So it's almost 4 A.M. right now, I woke up because once again I had a terrible nightmare about her and I can't sleep.  What better way to pass the time than to write in my blog!  This time the dream was something like her laughing at me again.  These nightmares aren't scary per se, it's the stark reality that is behind the dream that is so painful and sad.  She probably WAS laughing at me, maybe when she was reading the blogs (if she reads them) or when she's having a nice dinner with him.  Anyway, I'm happy that I've been getting feedbacks from people.  To reply to Jin's comments, I agree and I choose to suffer.  Well, I don't really choose it, more like it chooses me.  And what's wrong with suffering?  It means that I really was in love with her.  The pain I feel is a direct reflection on how much I cared for her.  Every heartache is just a reminder of how much I cared.  If I'm going to ache for the next forty years, so be it.  Hopefully the smoking can give me cancer and kill me way before then.  With God's help, one day, with every breath that I take, the pain will come mostly from my lungs instead of from my heart.

      As some of you might be wondering, "what the hell happened to Howard?"  I will give you a very brief rundown.  So I fell in love with this girl, fell in love with her most completely.  I thought she liked me, but she ended up picking another guy.  The end.  Now I walk around like there's a dagger in my heart.  And whenever I see something that reminds me of her, it's like someone turning that dagger ever so slightly by 90 degrees.  Ouch!  Bad times.  I guess what bothers me and probably some of the other people in the same situation is how she can just turn everything off with the snap of a finger.  She said she really cared but *snap*, she doesn't care anymore, she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to see me, and basically she doesn't want to be bothered.  Meanwhile, I'm toiling and suffering and it's like, what the hell?  What a great contrast.  "Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable." -Wizard of Oz

      Well, I'm jobless again.  Back to being the loser that I once was.  Not that I was much better when I had a job.  It's just hard to hold a sales job when I'm down and depressed.  Sales depend so much on being cheerful and excited so you can sell to your customers, and I just couldn't keep it up.  My life gets worse by the second.  Someone kill me please.  Thanks in advance.

      Ever had a heartache?  A really really bad heartache?  What's interesting about heartache is that it hurts like hell, yet nothing is happening to the heart itself.  Suppose a girl you love don't want to be with you or the girl you love cheated on you or whatever, your heart would ache as if someone had just ripped it out and stepped all over it.  It hurts bad, but there's no physical harm done to the heart, it just hurts for some reason.  And we accept it.  What if instead of heartache, we get shoulder aches?  That would be weird.  Anyway, heartache sucks.  The only good thing about having a heartache would be the fearlessness for death.  The heart hurts so bad that you actually welcome death.  "Well it's about time you arrived, Death, what took you so long?  Just emancipate me from this agony."  I can totally see myself saying that.

      I haven't been able to get much sleep lately, like the past couple of months or so.  I have these nightmares that make me sad :(  Even when I have a good dream, I would wake up, realize that they will never come true, and get sad and depressed again :(  It's kind of hard to fall asleep after that.  Having a 11 hour workday doesn't help my sleeping situation either.  I guess what I'm saying is that my life sucks.  Yet someone out there is living the life that I want, have the things that I want, maybe that's what is so frustrating.  Let's start a suicide club and we can all jump in front of a train holding hands (that's from a Japanese movie for those of you who don't know, and the movie sucked).  Wheeeeee!

      What is the meaning of life?  To some, it is to set a goal and to achieve that goal.  Some people want to make lots of money, some people want to be famous, and some just want to be with someone they love.  Suppose you have this goal, something or someone that you really really want.  You think to yourself, "man, if I can just have this, I don't care about anything else in the world."  You want it so bad, and you're willing to do anything for it.  Now suppose this goal says to you, "sorry, you can never have me.  You're yucky.  Fuck off."  Does that mean your life is no longer worth living?    Everybody has a goal in life.  Some set theirs higher than the others.  But we all have one.  It is what drives us, to wake up everyday and to continue living.  A waitress dreams of becoming a movie star, that's why she wakes up, goes to work, and lives, believing that one day, she will become a movie star.  Take that away from her and what is she left with?  Why would she want to keep on living?  Same with everyone.  Take away the thing that's most important in your life, why should you keep living?  Take away my goal and the most important thing in my life, why should I keep living?  "Hand me the world on a silver platter, And what good would it be? With no one to share With no one who truly cares For me." -Alicia Keys

      Hi!  I hope everyone had a good 4th of July even though I didn't.  Ah, 4th of July, a great day to spend with the one you love.  But if the one you love doesn't want to spend it with you, then it becomes the shittiest day ever.  Well, everyday is shitty if that's the case, but it hits extra hard on national holidays.  Anyway, if this is happening to you, whatever you do, don't go outside!  Because seeing other couples together will only make you even more depressed.  I recommend staying home and smoking it up!  Here are a couple of cigarette brands to try out.  One, American Spirit (http://www.nascigs.com/).  100% additive-free!  It's a bit on the pricey side but it sure goes down smooth.  Another one to try out is Blackstone.  It comes with several flavors, I recommend cherry.  You'll look so cool smoking a Blackstone cherry cigarette (Mark, you know what I'm talking about).    And if you're wondering where you can get cheap cigarettes, well, look no further than Discount Cigarettes in Rohnert Park.  The owner's name is Faoz and he sells stuff a lot cheaper than other places.  Other miscellaneous facts about Faoz:  He's from Yemen, he has two kids, his store only has one telephone line, he got screwed by MCI (got a $1200+ telephone bill) and now he can't get a credit card, and he's not interested in switching to AT&T.    So if you feel like your life is going nowhere, smoke it up!  Because who needs that extra 20 years of life anyway.  I'm not only the president of let's smoke it up club, I'm also a client.

      Sorry for the lack of posts. Nothing much has been happening, still the same old shit. I think people are tired of reading about how much I miss her, how much I want to see her, how much my life sucks, how much of a loser I am, etc. Oh well, but what else am I to write about? I'll start posting random pics if I really can't come up with anything.  I hate not being able to sleep, because then I just lie on the bed and think about her. Do I think about her because I am sleepless, or am I sleepless because I think about her? One thing is for certain, I cannot not think about her. I usually think about what I could be doing with her or what she is doing with him. The end results are always me being really sad. I also think about what would happen if I die and what if I can go back in time. The end results are always me being sad, but not as sad as the previous. I don't usually think about revenge and killing.  I wonder how she's doing. Would it make me feel better to know that she is a little bit sad? Mm...yes, but then I want her to have a good life and not be sad. So I don't really know how I'd feel. Love is stupid like that.

      I just helped my mom carry some groceries in, and I could barely lift a case of bottled water. Not that I was strong before but wow, I'm getting weak. I went to weigh myself again, still holding steady at 110. I think it's always bad when an adult's weight is less than his IQ (that is, my IQ according to Fox's TV show "Test The Nation". I outsmarted the blondes and the construction workers). I've only been eating one cup of noodle a day the past few days (well except when I went out to drink). Wasn't there a story where 3 college students died because all they ate were instant ramens for 3 months or something? Oh well, not that I have a good appetite anyway, I'd rather smoke than eat. Besides, I need to get use to not eating for my bumdom. But I need strength to push my Albertson/Safeway house around. I remember the days when I use to work out everyday. Nothing special, just some push-ups and sit-ups, because I didn't want to look too bad. So my routine before I went to sleep was push-ups, sit-ups, and pray. Oh yeah, that was about a month ago. Then shit happened. Now there's no point for me to do any of those things. Life sucks.

      Went out drinking again last night.  Threw up again.  I blame it either on the nonstop hiccups that I had, or the Marlboro that I smoked (both times that I threw up, I was smoking Marlboro).  While we were drinking, there was this couple sitting next to us.  They kept on fondling and kissing each other.  That disturbed me, actually more like that made me envious and jealous.  It also made me more sad and depressed :(  Anyway, we left the bar (by the way, there was still no smoking in the bar), walked back to my car only to find a nice $50 parking ticket.  Two things pissed me off about the ticket.  One, it was issued 5 minutes before we left the bar.  Two, there was a car parked right behind me, in the same zone, and he didn't get a ticket.  It's not that the car just got there, no, the car was there the whole time, I saw the car because we had to come out and smoke.  So even the cops favor others than me.  That's just the story of my life isn't it?   Did anything good happen last night?  Hm...let me think of something.  1.  I ate something.  I didn't eat anything the whole day, but I forced myself to eat something before we went drinking so that my body can absorb more alcohol.  Way to go alcohol!  2.  We bought 2 packs of Marlboro Mediums for $5.40, that's less than $3 per pack!  For those of you who don't smoke, that is really cheap.  3.  Alcohol blurred my mind by the end of the night, so I wasn't AS sad as before.  4.  Drinking and driving is fun!  You never know when you'll die.  Especially going up the mountain to my house.  Can't judge distance and react very well when you're drunk, but that's part of the fun!

      13th amendment to the list of stuff I've learned...  13. People say they care, but they really don't.  They say they care, but they can turn it off with a snap of a finger  Now I'm not saying those who are posting don't care, it's just that I've heard people say they care, when they actually don't.  So y'all have to bare with me and my distrust (sorry Jin!).  And then there are times where it's wrong to care.  Show too much care, and people hate you for it.  For example, when they don't want you to care.  When you do, they're like, "why do you care?  Please stop caring and leave me alone."  Someone should sort it all out and write a book on caring politics and policies.

      Well, guess what kids, I'm being kicked out of the house.  No one likes losers, not even parents.  Just more verification for me that yes, I am a loser.  No one really wants to deal with me.  Anyway, I will soon be homeless around October, so that's about a month or so.  We should get together and have a nice dinner before I start wandering the streets.  Good thing I can solicit well, hopefully I will be able to afford a Big Mac a day.  Good thing I don't eat that much.  If there is a God, here's his train of thoughts : "You are a loser, you should become a bum.  To prepare you for bumdom, I will make you lose your appetite through heartbreak, and give you a job to teach you how to solicit, but not too well, just enough to get by.  There you are ready."  Maybe I'll write a book, "How To Go From A Happy-Go-Lucky Guy, Full Of Dreams And Goals To A Sad, Depressing, Suicidal, Homeless Bum In 2 Months (Accelerated Course)"  I had a cool dream last night.  It was October, it was a goodbye party, and I invited everyone I knew to my house.  It was a nice party, good food, everybody was having a good time, even me.  When the clock struck 12, I gathered everybody in the livingroom to give a speech.  In the speech, I said something like "this isn't a goodbye party for me going to the East Coast, no, this is THE goodbye party."  Then I took out a gun, smiled at everyone, and shot myself.  But I didn't die.  It was a toy gun.  "Just kidding," I explained.  "Actually I will die within 30 minutes, I took some drugs.  I didn't want to shoot to kill myself because it's such a mess and if someone grabbed the gun, I might not die.  Plus there's a risk of hitting other people."  Then I woke up.  Two things to note, one, she was actually there, front row, when I shot myself with the fake gun.  Two, I love how rational I was in that dream.  P.S. CO detectors suck

      As you all know, I spent the whole day yesterday on my tientsai account, and I replied to everybody who messaged me. A total of five people IMed me. Out of the five, four people know my other account, so they can talk to me whenever. Which means only one person wondered how I was doing. That means if I die, pretty much no one would feel a difference, that's how significant I am. Of the four people, only two had a more than five lines conversation with me, but those conversations weren't very long either. As you can see, no one really gives a rat's ass about me. They probably didn't even notice that I was gone for more than a month.  Since I am on the subject of results and discoveries, let me make a list of all the things I've learned in this past month.  1. Life sucks 2. God doesn't exist 3. I hate myself (I would say "I'm a loser and asshole and idiot and etc.," except I sorta already knew that, she just verified it) 4. Various suicide methods (thank you VP and Suicide Holiday) 5. Burning oneself really hurts (recommended only if you're feeling really depressed and bad about yourself) 6. Cigarettes are expensive (I now think of everything in terms of packs of cigarettes now. A tapioca milk tea? That's more than half a pack! Bridge toll? That's a dollar short of a pack!) 7. I don't like Marlboro 8. Blackstone is a cigar and I shouldn't be inhaling them, but I am 9. Smoking in a bar is good, having to walk outside and smoke sucks 10. I dream about her roughly 2 out every 3 nights (some good, some bad, but after I wake up, they all make me sad) 11. I am insignificant to the world (I sorta already knew that, now it's been verified) (sorry for wasting you guys' oxygen, but on the good side, I'm not taking up too much food) 12. I'm a loser and asshole and idiot and etc. (I guess I have to put this down because of what I wrote in 11)

      Everything reminds me of her.  Every little thing somehow can relate back to her.  Long hair girl walking around, reminds me of her.  A white car driving around, reminds of her.  Two door cars, reminds me of her.  Hip pop/rap music, reminds of her.  Hell, Asian girl walking around, reminds me of her.  And when I go out and do things, doing things reminds me of her.  These things fall into three categories, things I did with her, things I know she did, and things I want to do with her.  Going to a restaurant, reminds me of her.  Playing poker, reminds me of her...  Anyway on a separate note, as you all know, I've been off my tientsai AIM account for a while now.  However this Sunday, I'm going to logon using that account for the whole day.  Just as an experiment, I wonder how many people would actually message me and say what's up.   Writing e-mails and messaging, remind me of her...

      Another night out drinking and smoking.  Same bar, but this time, they wouldn't let us smoke inside.  What's the point of going to a Korean bar if we can't smoke indoor!?  Anyway, we had to smoke out in the cold.  Right in front of the bar parked a white Prelude, the car she drives.  So whenever we smoked, I was just staring at the car :(  At least I didn't throw up this time, I guess that's good.

      Well, as if my life isn't crappy enough, there are more drama in my life now.  Can't really go into much details, and I don't feel like giving out details, it's a bit personal, but let's just say that it involves my grandparents, money, and death.   WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LIFE SUCKS!!!  The only person I would talk to about it is "her" since I already told her some personal family stuff.  But I guess she's too good for my family, she wouldn't want to talk to me anyway.  She's like "yikes, gotta skadaddle out of here, he has issues!"  Life sucks, time to smoke.

      Well, it seems like I've lost some weight.  I haven't had a good appetite in a while.  I've lost around 15 pounds.  I now weigh in at a unhealthy 110 (not that 125 was that healthy either), and well on my way to 100 lbs.  Woot!  Good times.  Okay not really.  Life sucks.  How are you doing on the weight issue, Mr. VP?  I think I'll hit 100 by mid August.  On a side note, here are all the people I know who have read my blogs, in random order:  =/, Jin, Mark, Dave, JH, Jason, and Shihoko  If you're not on the list and would like to be on the list, just comment on this post, and remember the first rule of the club.

      My lower back hurts.  I think it's from all the tossing and turning I do when I sleep (or try to).  Must have twisted it somehow.  Life sucks, the world sucks.

      Smoking alone isn't fun.  I just washed my car while smoking.  All I could think about was her and it made me sad.  Ended up smoking 2 cigarettes in 15 minutes.  I guess that's good, or bad depending on your point of view.  "So regretful, So heartbroken, Who can put me back together, I'm willing to give up everything, For a time machine." -Mayday

      Wow, it's August already. This site has been around for almost a month. Looking back, July 2004 had to be the worst month of my life, meanwhile it was probably her best month of her life :(  The forecast for the next month doesn't look very good.  I don't really have anything else to say, y'all already know how I feel. It's the same miserable shit everyday.   Why waste your time by having you read through shit you already know.
