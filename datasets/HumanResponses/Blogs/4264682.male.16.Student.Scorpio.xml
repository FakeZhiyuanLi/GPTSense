      As some may have seen, the Cubs blew the ninth inning lead against the Astros tonight.  Latroy Hawkins has to be the worst closer in baseball.  If only the bullpen could live up to the starting staff... as is, Dusty might as well leave the starters in the whole game.  On another note, my aunt recently got married and has to get rid of her cat Izzy because my uncle is allergic.  My family was going to take Izzy, but apparently she is not "friendly" enough for my mom, the older of my little sisters, and my brother.  Pity; I rather like Izzy, I must say, even though she hisses a lot right now because she's not used to us.  *rolls eyes*  She'd get used to us eventually if we'd just take her.  Today was my mom's annual family reunion picnic.  We played volleyball for a long time and I had a lot of fun, even though I got a splinter in my toe.  I'll end this post with a joke I heard today:       Son:  "Daddy, do all fairy tales start with 'Once upon a time?'"      Father:  "No, many of them start 'If elected, I promise...'"

      Sorry that I haven't posted in a while, but yesterday I took a rather unexpected trip to my grandparents in Chicago, so that's where I am now.  The Cubs game was a heck of a game (they beat the Brewers in 11 innings).  Nomar Garciaparra had a really good game, too, with 3 doubles.  Come on, they've gotta make the playoffs.  On another note, I've done so much driving lately, I'm rather sick of it.  Driving to Chicago, driving to Milwaukee, and driving for work have worn me out.  Kudos to anyone who identifies the band, song, and album that this post's title comes from.  Today, I went to a mall in Indiana and picked up a copy of the Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien.  It's pretty good.  I'll post again tomorrow.  Tchao.

      I'm headed to the Cubs game in Milwaukee tonight, so I may or may not make a real, significant post today.  The Cubs better win, because they better make the playoffs.

      As you may or may not know, I was once in a "band" called Parkway Lanes.  Pity we didn't go anywhere.  Well, I'll occasionally be posting songs that I or my friend and "band"mate wrote, so without further ado:   Time Controls Our Lives      Moving too fast, it’s all a blur    All I can do is think of her    Hope it don’t last, how can this be?    High-speed life’s been tearing at me      Chorus:   It never stops running          The clock don’t stop turning          Like sand thru the hourglass          Seconds of my life have passed          Into nothingness, wasted away          I still don’t know what to say          Why does time have to control our lives?      Time slips by, I want to know why    Life’s too short for me to lie    I hate the clock, all of its strife    What do I wanna do with life?      Bridge:  Time wasted away          I can’t tell what to say          Life wasted with indecisiveness          Time making life a mess          Can’t decide what to do yet          But I don’t wanna have regrets…    And that's it.  Tell me what you think.  Did we suck, or did we  suck ?   I wish I was still in a band, but alas, Steve no longer shows any interest in pursuing the band and I haven't played my guitar in months.  If anybody lives near Craptown and is interested in starting a band with me, I'm up for ideas.

      This is my first post, just to say hello to all who may be dangerously stupid enough to read my blog. You've been warned: too much intake of this blog may be hazardous to your health. Now go away and get out of my hair... or leave me lots of cool comments about what I should remark on.  Anyways, school starts here soon, I'm ready to graduate next spring. I hate my job. Sometimes I wish I had a money tree. Actually, I can't think of a time when I wouldn't like a money tree, although there are things I'd rather have. Feel free to leave comments on what I should write about next. (Catching a theme here?)  To follow up my friend's tradition to an extent, the theme band for my blog until I decide a different band is the theme is  Slick Shoes  (www.slickshoes.net).

      Hey all, I'm back from Chi-town.  Picked up a copy of Neverwinter Nights Gold on the way, so this post is gonna be a short one because I wanna play it.  We didn't keep Izzy (alas).  I really liked her.  Thankfully I didn't have to drive on the way home.  I also finished the Silmarillion today.  It was pretty darn good.
