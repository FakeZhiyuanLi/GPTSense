      Okay story time. This weekend was totally  AWESOME!  Friday was. . . .i dont remember. lol Saturday me and bean took the yungin's to Walnut Hills. It was cool. I met this guy CJ there. He shoved me off the dock twice. grrr i was very mad. He was cute though. We were shootin eachother with the arcade guns. Then we went and walked around with them for a lil bit. The yungings got taken home and we went back into the water. There was a short dude with CJ but he wouldnt tell me his name. geez. . . what a weirdo. i got a sunburn from being in the sun too long. Im a walking lobster.  OWWWWIIEE!! *tear*   Today i went to my cousin Tiffany's Open House. I had to go there at noon to help set up. We bought a bunch of silly string and i got the mexican. Bwwwahahaha! i have learned that mexican's CAN NOT roll!  anyways, ice-cream cameron came and threw peanuts at me. he's a jerk. no, i love my cameron. lol We didn't leave the open house until 7:30 and got home at a round about time of 8. then me and bean went over to tyler's and hung out. Wade came over a few minutes ago. He brought over a new dirt-bike he was trying to ride. Wade's a lil tipsy tonight. He's got an empty 24 pack in the back of his vany-thingy. stupid drunk people. they're so cool! lol   I miss my Kari. I haven't seen her since school got out. *tear tear* hey at least now i can show her my new tan! yay!  im cool now man. Kari we must go to the mall and cause havoc again. like the toy guns and JC Penny's. well gtg time to go riding!  layter!                            Jessica

      Hey there cowpokes. I'm sitting in Kentucky tonight. This morning i was awoken (whao weird word) at 10 A.M  & was told to pack for Kentucky. God Almighty!Can't a girl at least wake the hell up?! Oh. .  .hee hee. Congrats to Craiger and Bean. That was a suprise. I didnt think u two would go out but. . .  wow . I guess Woody's ma had a lil convo w/ Amanda's ma. I guess that Amanda's ma has been treating her  REALLY  badly (like S.S. bad) and woody's ma was fed up. Go robin! i think she neds out of there. Oh speaking of getting out, Ethan came over today (southern boy. . . mmmmmm). He gave me a song and a pic of him. They were a "rememberance". Oh god, mushy-lovey stuff.  I'm not used to that. And no kari you may not hook me up w/ Michael! lol wow im bouncing from sub. to sub. really quickly. Anyways, the reason  WHY  i am down here is becuz my ma has to file a lawsuit against Dr. Cheng for malpractice. woo hoo. Kari, do not worry about Kristelle. She is not goin to ruin anything. I shall make sure. But i gtg so uh. . . .talk layter!           p34c3 0|_|t               CharLiE

      Hey there ya all. today wasn't anythin anymore interesting. i gotta go over to my dad's house today. yayhoo. me and heather were talking today. i guess next year amanda might move in with Travis (her bf) and "start a family".OMFG! what is wrong with people lately? i guess shes been stealing her ma's pot too. Crazy crazy world. Im listening to Blue Oyster Cult right now but other than that. . .Steve is trying to give me some of his Gamcube games becuz they're wrestling ones. lol he's such a character. George attacked me again, damn chicken. The only reason why i wont eat chicken and that   scemo   attacks me! Tom decided to try and shoot it. He was lucky i missed him. It wouldnt have hurt that bad though. BB guns just leave a lil mark.   Question of the day (yeah i got one): Which is better--- an overweight billionaire or rail-thin supermodel? i say the overweight billionaire becuz then you can pay for lipsuction. the rail-thin thing would be worse becuz thats prolly anorexia or bulemia or some gay shit. well gtg my cousin andrea's here layter!

       Okay this is my first entry so it might now be all that interesting. My weekend was fun though. Friday i went to Bean's softball game. They lost horrifically (15-4). But hey, the good news is they didn't mercy like the other 4 games. lol im sorry bean i love ya.&nbsp;Then i spent the night at her house. Saturday Devin kidnapped me to his house. We were jumping on his bed just to freak his twin brother out. it was pretty funny. Then we went into the garage and was looking at old comic books and we pulled an old matress onto the floor to sit on. He kissed me on the forehead. That was weird and unexpected. It was cute though. Oh god, blabbering about Devin. God help me stop.   This Week me, Kari, Jake, and Devin are gunna go see Garfield. I hope so anyways. My cousin Tiffany got put in the hospital yesterday. She had a blood clot in her lung. o god. i think shes gunna be okay though.&nbsp;Kari's speaking l33t again.  ! c4/\/7 _n)3r574 n) !t  well i better go eyes are drooping. layter    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CharLiE

      Today was a pretty cool day. I had my uncle Marv's surprise 50th bday party out in chesaning. that was sweet. i got to see Lil Bastard and Tiff and their new baby Clinton. Thursday I went out dirtbiking in Linden. 50 acres of non-stop dirtbiking fun. We took the quad, go cart, 2 PW 80's, and the TW 200. I got to ride the 200. *big grin* Whit and me rode down Cole and hit the chloride spread. that sucked. the shit burned like hell! lol god i never thought it'd stop burning. I missed heather's bday yesterday. *tear*  IM SORRY HEATHER!  i got to get her a belated-bday present. rick got really sick from camping (something about the water) and was ill thursday. awww poor baby. i was gunna go over and chill with him but i decided to go out and ride and then brag to him about it. me and amber went and saw The Village yesterday. I thought it sucked! it wasnt that freaky supernatural shit it usually is. DAMNIT! oh well i guess. i saw spencer and shep and all them but, like usual, i avoided them.  anyways, i think kari is kinda mad at me. I havent seen her but 3 times all summer. That really blows but she's got so much band shit going on and when she's got free time im busy. School will be starting soon and we'll see eachother everyday. She'll be wishing that she didn't see me so much. lol im having a party at my dad's after band camp. It's for Whit's 16th birthday. She cant have a real party at her house so my pappi said i could. besides whit and craig, tiffany will be the only one from linden. well i should go. time to harrass my pillow. nitey-nite!

       Oh my god i had so much fun camping! we went up to River Ridge Campground&nbsp;in Breckenridge. The campgrounded  SUCKED!  lol yeah we had a toilet-paper fight up at the bathrooms at 2 am. That was Me, Rick, Caleb, and Mike. Caleb got nailed in the face. Rick tried tackling me so i bit him on the shoulder. The he bit me back again. Caleb was peeking on me in the shower (or  TRYING  to anyways) Me and Rick aren't   "technically"   dating but we kinda are. lol anyways, yesterday we got in a water fight up at the park and Caleb and Jake ended up getting kicked outta the park!! the managers are fucking retarded! they told us we had to have it at the park but then they said we couldnt and they ended up booting caleb and his bro. then we went up to the bathrooms and had another toilet-paper fight. They kicked Caleb out again. that was fucking hilarious! me and rick had to share a tent. Oh dont worry, i wasn't complaining at  ALL  about it. i had fun. *wink wink* I tried getting rick to go skinny dipping in the pond with me but it was too cold for him. awww poor baby! that damn shithead (rick) deflated my airmatress so that i&nbsp;would have to share his.&nbsp;pathetic. . . .    &nbsp;  i got a new dirtbike two days ago. well its not new its ricks old one. It's a Yamaha TW 200. I cant even touch the ground on the damn thing. We took em up onto the Gladwin Trailhead and rode. Nuttin but whoops and soft sand. That was a really rough trail. and my damn bike kept stalling everytime i downshifted. Then bob's clutch broke so we had to go back. Rick got on my lil bro's PW 80 and crashed it going up a sand hill. i was laughing my ass off. Moron. . . We were pulling the bikes off the trailer and rick tripped and dropped the bike, breaking the right blinker in the back. oh well. . .im making him fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, i miss my kari so much! i've only got to see her 3 times all summer! I have so much to tell her! *tear* Well not really so much if shes been reading my blog. lol kari you need to write in yours more often!&nbsp;you can talk about how cute and smart and adorable and funny i am if you want to. lol yeah ya all know its true! well i gotta go time for me to crash. Night-Night!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CharLiE

NOT GOOD  . we took it and seran-wrapped stevey's whole body. head and all. we cut a hole in the mouth so he could breath. then we tok permanent marker and drew on his chin where there wasnt wrap. it took us about 20 minutes to get stevey out. then we seran-wrapped brian. stevey ended up pourng chocolate down brians throat and choked him. it was all down his shirt and onto my bed. later on we were bullshitting and stevey and bri decided they wanted their legs waxed. okay, so i got out the wax and heated it up. we did one big strip on the back of each of their thighs. They both squeled like stuck pigs. You think people would learn after that? nope, brian decided to wax his genitals.   OUCH!!   he was balling his eyes out. i fewlt bad. . . .wait. . . .nope i didnt it was fucking hilarious! he was on the phone with sme gabrielle chick when he did it. thats a moron for ya. well i think i should go. . ..bri's coming upstairs. he'd have a tissy if he read this. lol&nbsp; layter  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CharLiE

Ron Cosper. i was on a caterpillar ride with Booser (shes 3) and bri was pointing at him. i started laughing because he has like elvis sideburns now. i was gunna stay and watch the motocross races but it started to rain. We drove over to Rick's house and i saw his new dirtbike. they were having trouble getting it started  because its not an automatic and it has a compressor and everything. Basically you gotta get it just right to start it. It was like $5000.00 too! wowza! lol Yeah theyre supposed to be coming out tonight so me and rick can hang out for a lil while.   Bean called me earlier while i was at the fair. the foot party she was going to got canceled and she wanted to go but we were already gone. i called her when i got home and she wants me to call her back when rick gets here so she can have a "discussion" with him. oh god. speaking of discussions, i havent heard from kari since our fight. i wrote her an email but she hasnt written me back yet. oh well i guess. yeah. . . but. . . im gunna go so layter                 CharLiE

I guess she is getting sent to a military boarding school for girls. It was cuz she went out and got home at 11:30 instead of 11:00 and they accused her of drinking. Thats whack! She's leaving in a month cuz her parents want her to get "setled in" 2 weeks early. ha ha ha nah i feel kinda bad though. that would totally suck. well i gotta go i'll write some other time           layter                    Jessica

Good luck to him. it would be sweet if he made it. Hee hee im playing with the fonts.  anyways, brian came over and we went through the shit he was getting rid of. i found these cool looking vintage blankets i wanted to keep. They're all funky colors. He was making fun of me  because he cant believe i got a boyfriend. shit man! im not  THAT  ugly! no he said it was because im a freak. thanks that makes me feel better.   Brian and me set up the bonfire and poured a shit-load of gasoline and lighter fluid on it then set it ablaze. Being intelligent like we are we put our christmas tree on the top of the burning pile. The flame shot up to like 40 feet! no joke! it was crazy-ness!  we were laughing so god-damn hard. we caught the tree on fire too. then brain was putting more gasoline on the fire and the neck of the gas can lit up. his eyes got huge and he was screaming "put it out! omg! put it out!". then he claimed how his whole life flashed before his very eyes. what a baby.       Anywho, im gunna try to con my dad to take me to the Demolition Derby tommorrow at the Shiawassee County Fair. That is gunna be a sick show and i would cry if i missed it. i can already feel the tears welling up. hey i gotta go though, brian is whining about getting on. see you all layter!

      I am so frigging tired! yesterday me and carmen went and picked bean up. I finally got to see Kari! yay! anyways, then me and bean went to bob's out in howell and i got to ride my baby! the damn electric start was acting up so i had to kick start it. i coulldnt touch the ground! grrr then it kept bogging out on me and we had to use electrical tape on the tail-light cuz rick broke it. it was fun after all that though cuz i got to open it up out in the field. it only got up to 75 though cuz the field is too small. Bean was riding the 80 and she wiped out. it was funny as hell! i got to catch some of the bmx competition for X Games X but i didnt see much. they had some sick moves. 2 of them tied for 2nd with 88.00. . . . .okay enough about that stuff. im babysitting  right now and then i got to go get my dads house set up for whit's party.  ITS TOMMORROW!  i got her a carebear cake (HA) my birthday is almost here!!! woot woot! if ya'll wanna buy me a present you can.  *big grin*  i like cd's a lot. or money. . . .that's cool too. Last night i was talking to cameron and i was telling him i put a hex on him (although i didnt) and he was trying to scare me. he told me one of them cut his arm. yeah, uh-huh.  Ya know, i dont think kari realy likes me anymore. i called her and she wasnt really into talking to me. usually she tells me all about wherever she went. Of course bean filled me in. lord that girl annoys the sin out of me. thats why im having this party so i can see all of my friends again. Kari if youre reading this i love you. lol well i better go. shane is freaking out. talk to ya'll when i get a chance                               CharLiE
