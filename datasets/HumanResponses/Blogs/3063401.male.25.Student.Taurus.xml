      Wonderful! I love the NFL for this decision. I hate Pro sports with wrong decisions - soccer in Europe is awful, because there's no instant replay. So many games are decided because of incorrect decisions by the referee(s). Soccer purists state that there never was the necessity for instant replay in the old ages, so they do not need one now. Did they play soccer on that level fifty years ago? Nah, but back to the NFL. There's more... The old rule has been modified. Every team who challenges two times in a game may get a third one. But only if the two previous challenges were justified. This has been implemented because coaches clearly accepted wrong calls in the early minutes of a game in order not to waste a red flag...   There's another great thing about the decision to keep the rule for five more seasons: It's not a "rule" yet. It's still a proposal for a rule change, but the rules of the game of Football have not been officially changed yet.   Let's give it five more years! When should we do our crossword-puzzles if not during Coach's Challenge? Ah yeah, commercials - forgot all about them....   And one more note about soccer: I really lost interest in soccer, because the German championship was decided by a poor call a couple of years ago. Furthermore, penalty calls have become "whimp calls". Guys falling everywhere. Touch 'em, they fall, referee stops play. Don't need to watch that...

      Okay, not only because the Baseball Season has started - that only happens in Spring - we noticed that it's Spring!  It's been a wonderful sunny day and - guess what - I am blogging sitting outside; thanx to wireless LAN. This really can only be said by a student of Computer Science "It's Spring because I can surf the net sitting outside."   Wow, this raises a serious thought: Is Wireless LAN the savior of youth? Everybody keeps on complaining that young people stay inside too often (sometimes all the time [Hello Jannis!]...), don't breathe fresh air but stay inside, surfing the internet or playing "on-line".  If you ask me: Wireless LAN may make .com-people go outside, but it still won't get computer nerds to socialise with other means other than the internet or teach them to speak the same language as most people. So this leads to another serious concern: If all those computer nerds get out more, maybe this will frighten the other non-tech-people so much, the nerds will urge them to stay inside...     Is that really better?  ;-)   btw: I might have exaggerated the whole thing a little bit ...

         ...but only with special motivation. I told you yesterday: "Torre cannot motivate the Yanks anymore." Well, I was wrong. This picture was taken before the game. I bet'cha the quote goes something like "Jorge, if you're not gonna hit one out of the park today, I am gonna shoot myself".

      Really good episode. We get to know Vaughn's wife and Sidney's Dad is really showing his love for his daughter - again. However, I think he should not have placed the worm on the computer system. Why?  My theory: The video Jack saw was a modified fake. The real video, which the CIA got, would have shown Vaughn's wife as the killer!  But that is just a feeling of mine, because if you watch Sidney and Vaughn's wife profile you cannot see any difference.  Let's see how it all turns out.

      Even though Nip/Tuck goes more and more into the unbelievable, the ideas the writers have are shocking, however, possible with the current state of technology.  This episode is very much a prelude to next weeks season finale. Let's hope it'll live up to its expectations - which are very high for me, because of the very good quality the first season had.   Waiting for the finale...

      For me this was the  best  Trek, by which I mean all Star Trek series/movies (whatever!), story in a long, long time!  Really, it was awesome. This is what I expect(ed) from a prequel to Star Trek. The Andorians were introduced in the first season as a hostile, aggressive species, who has been fighting over nothing with the Vulcans for generations. Then there is the main Andorian character 'Shran'; hostile at first, but nonetheless honorable. His fav trademark is one thing: he hates debts. He always tries to repay a debt to Archer as fast as possible. And then the mere fact that he is played by Mr. Combs.   The relationship between Archer and Shran is really interesting and I really hope that they will feast on that in the coming episodes. The prelude to this episode was also very good, although some of the episodes, which were not directly connected to the Xindi weapon, were a little tiny bit boring.  However, it would be a damn shame if they would cancel an excellent show like Enterprise.  This episode has everything you wanna look for: good direction, good music, good sound effects, humour and - most important - a thrilling story which made sense if you consider all the other Trek series, which were shown before.  It's a known fact that the Andorians will be first to create an alliance which will be known as the UFP later. I guess, everybody remembers what the UFP is, right? I am kidding, of course. Thus, this episode is just because of this *curse-word-deleted* exciting!  At last, two scenes I will remember for life: First, the shot of Archer (*) from behind having antennas, second the staged dialogue between Shran and the Xindi.    (*) I'd like to blog a shot of this, but Paramounts Copyright laws oblige me rather not to :-)  Let's see what's in store next week!

      The season couldn't start any better. A low-budget team beats the team with the highest budget in Baseball, if not even one of the highest budgets in all Pro Sports.  I bet the Yanks are gonna blame it on jet lag or the playing field, however, I think a change in coaching after last season would have been a choice for them. Even though the Yanks reached the World Series the last two years, I think the Yanks aren't fighting as much as they should in order to win the World Series. The reason for this is that they are missing motivation and motivation is the coach's job.  Finally, I think the A-Rod trade hasn't done them any good because of all the media attention and Jeter pushing him away from his natural Short Stop position. In today's game there was a ball right on the foul line; A-Rod missed it. It was a difficult catch, but a 3rd base man who earns that much money mast make things happen!  In case you haven't noticed: I hate big-budget teams, who try to acquire all the good players in order to secure championships. It's not about the money, really, I just think that it doesn't serve sports if quality players have to sit-out games, just because they're so many good players on a team. Just think of the position  urlLink Lofton  bats in right now...

           Personally, I have given up hope in all those American TV networks! Their decisions in the last couple of years which series to keep for another season and which to cancel were incomprehensible to me. Good, thought-out shows got cancelled whereas stupid, reality shows were promoted and support for another season. With the result that people lost interest in the second year, because everything was the same as in the first year. Thus, good shows got cancelled for reality shows that got cancelled one year later... If you ask me: Can't be good for business...  However, there's still a shred of hope out there. May be Fox is going back to the roots! 'Family Guy' is back in production. Reason for this are extremely good ratings for the repeats which are being shown right now. Furthermore, the DVD sales are profitable.   Infos on the show at  urlLink www.zap2tv.com . Full episode guide at  urlLink www.epguides.com .   urlLink Original article  Source: Zap2TV

      Eines der schlimmsten Dinge für mich ist es, meine Webpage zu warten. Ich bin einfach viel zu faul, hin und wieder mal den HTML-Quelltext zu durchwühlen, um neue Infos usw. unterzubringen.  Vor einigen Wochen fand ich im Internet Blogger. Eine wirklich tolle Sache! Man nennt Blogger einfach die Adresse seiner Homepage und schwups-die-wups hat man eine Art "E-Mail-System" zur Verfügung, mit dem man aktuelle Dinge auf die Web-Page "posten" kann. Auch Bilder usw. können problemlos an Blogs angehängt werden. Das Editieren der HTML Sourcen dürfte wohl somit der Vergangenheit angehören.  Also werde ich absofort meine Versprechen halten können, wenn ich sage: "Ich lade die Sachen auf meine Homepage, dann kannst Du es Dir anschauen" :-)

Esp. the "dream" scenes were amazing. What was real, what was dreamt. Nice way of telling a story! But Alias was always good in shocking the audience. Nice seeing Franci - or her evil clone - again ...  It was also very interesting to see Jack do a job for Sidney.

      In this episode everything happened, but not what I expected ...  The relationship - or the non-existent one - between Vaughn and Sidney is quite exciting. Vaughn's wife warming up to Sidney seems a little bit strange. May be there's still something up with Vaughn's wife.  Mr. S being shown as the Evil Guy of the season - or at least dealing with the people responsible for Sidney's abstinence - was nothing I was expecting. I always had Sark made out as Sloane's lil' helper... not up to much by himself.  I was wrong - as most of the times. However, I am still putting Vaugn's wife to the evil side and she has to prove herself, before I give up my doubts.

      That was good.  The finale was excellent esp. because mostly everything got resolved. Only one thing stays uncertain. However, it's good to see that writers still have the guts to conclude story arcs at the end of a season. It's become a habit of stretching story arcs over seasons - on and on and on.   Mostly, I do not like series that get so much praise by famous critics. But this time I have to agree. Nip/Tuck was 100% must-see TV; every episode.   Hope they will keep up the quality next year.

      Yahoo Messenger has a nice feature called Voice Messages. It works really good and I use it frequently to call up friends who have broadband internet as well.  The best thing about it is that it's free.   However, there's a nice thing a friend did to me. That guy lives out of my local zone, thus calling him is not that cheap. For that reason we always took turns calling each other. Then we started using Yahoo Messenger with Voice.  One day I asked him if he'd voice call me back in a couple of minutes... He answered: "Yep, if you call me next time you cheap shot" :-)   So my train of thought was this: If you Yahoo Message a girl you'd like to date and she tells you that she wouldn't call you back.... It's even worse than getting no response to a phone call, because it's free! If a girl does not call you back when you give her your phone number and she doesn't call: "Okay, maybe she's not that liquid right now... ok... I understand" But if you Yahoo with her and she doesn't call you back - wow, it's more like: "Why do I deserve this?"  Ok, we could really get into a "Sex And The City Discussion" right now, because they had the topic quite often.  But remember: "Never break up on a post it!"  But what about Voice Messaging?

The time jumps very nice and keeping me interested all the way.   Was there anything I didn't like in this episode? No. Just like that.  Am I interested in next week? Oh yeah! I can hardly wait what will happen...   We haven't seen much of Trip/T'Pol action lately, so I guess it's gonna be in next weeks episode again. There were some nice references to their "relationship", but I think there's much to happen this season.  The Doctor wasn't that much of a factor this week either. I guess he had his fair share this season in earlier episodes. "Doctor's Orders" will have something to do with him as well, I guess.  Again, I can only state that I really hope, we're gonna see a lot more of Enterprise...  Just as I want to click on the "Post" button,  something comes to my mind. Is it really believable that the Debris Field is conflicting with the simulation? The whole ship is alright, but just the system to control the simulation is affected.... That storyline was a little bit funny and could have been implemented differently.   Just make Porthos pee at the panels or something ;-) (not one of my best ideas, obviously)

      This is the second day in a row with perfect weather! And I have to do a homework assignment - inside... Sitting at the desktop and thinking about tax systems.  I really pity those who graduate this May... they have even more stuff to learn than I do ... I have a feeling it's gonna be a nice summer... Even though it already makes me feel better, knowing that some people share my fate ...  But I think for today, it's enough... I'll go outside.  Sometimes one has to keep things at rest....  ;-)

      There's so much to blog about these days and not enough time to publish it all.... "TV life" is pretty bad right now, because I had to cope with watching the last Friends episode EVER. Yes, it's true, but at least everything ends well - or does it? *g* I am not giving anything away..   However, it's gonna be strange, coming home from work on a Thursday night and not being able to watch a nice, relaxing, funny, extraordinary episode of Friends. People keep saying "Life's gonna change if you get older." But does it really have to involve not having Friends around?   Well, I guess, there's always watching repeats... There's plenty of episodes to watch over and over again ;-)  It's not the same though. Pity.  Really eager to watch Joey's spinn-off in Fall. Hope it's gonna be a success like Frasier. He came from Cheers, remember.

      A couple of weeks ago Google invited me to check out GMail. After this time I come to the conclusion: I really like GMail. Not because of it's amazing overwhelming amount of storage capacity (1 Gig), more so because of the wonderful way how emails are displayed. Threads are displayed in a stacked tab style, which is really handy, but sometimes also a little bit confusing.  PCMag.com has a  urlLink review  of the whole service.

      It could have happened for the first time in over a decade -- no new episodes of a Star Trek series in the 2004/05 TV season.  UPN decided to move Enterprise to another spot, but will continue it for another, a 4th season. In my opinion the reason is obvious.  26 + 26 + 24  equals less than 100. For non-US readers: series can go in so-called syndication with at least 100 episodes being produced. Syndication means a lot of revenue for a TV series. Other networks could pick up Enterprise and UPN would cash in for every episode being shown on another network. Thus, in the worst case, there will be  100 - ( 26 + 26 + 24 )  more episodes; then UPN will get rid of Enterprise and try to make as much money with it as possible. The high production costs per episode support my opinion. It's cheaper producing a couple more episodes, instead of throwing away three seasons of highly priced episodes.  Looking back at season 3 I have to say that it was the best. Trek has never been as good as this for a long time. Voyager did not do much for me; way to boring; no characters. Enterprise has character development and a story that makes sense (if you forget about the fact that the following series do not make any sense right now, which will be solved with a different time-line argument in the end... ;-) ). The Xindi are pretty exciting and all the episodes of season 3 make up one big story. That fact alone is exciting!  Well, I am eager to see the last couple of episodes...

      Calgary - pride of the Canadien hockey fans! You did what no Canadien team has done for a long long long long time!    This brings up a conflict of fan interest for me. I like the Sharks very much, however, if they win against the Avs, I guess I will root for Calgary again. Canada and the NHL has been a dilemma for the last couple of years - currency being the main point of interest. Thus, I think it's rather nice that two Canadien teams are still up and running for the Stanley Cup.  Tonight, I'll root BIG TIME for the Leafs!

      I´ve just found the  urlLink website  of  the  best ice cafe !! If you´re a fan of ice cream, visit the website and you´ll get very, very hungry...hmmm.   If you haven´t been there yet and haven´t tasted the really good ice for acceptable prices, you will have to do it this summer! The journey from the Ruhrgebiet takes a while, but it is really worth it, I promise. And after eating the ice, you can visit the beautiful surroundings of Lüdinghausen, such as the Burg Vischering, the Burg Lüdinghausen or the Schloss Nordkirchen.  Have a lot of fun !!

      I was totally mad at Borland for not delivering a - printed - documentation for Delphi 8. No developer coming from Delphi 7 had a frillin' clou how everything with .NET worked and had to be implemented. I found a wonderful book, which solves the gap between Delphi 7 and Delphi 8 for .NET. I'll blog another .NET book specially for Delphi tomorrow, but this book from Mr. Richter should not be missing in any book shelf - there's no mention about Delphi in that book though. It concentrates of the aspects of the .NET framework - not the languages that "use" the framework.       Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming

      I often criticised the NY Yanks for not playing tough, because they already have all the money and success they can dream of. But yesterday, game #3 vs. the Red Sox, was the best regular season game I have ever seen. And believe me: I've seen a lot - even though I am from Germany.  Derek Jeter's sacrifice for the team was amazing. I cannot see any other player committing such a deed for his team. Unbelievable!   But the Red Sox fought like a true team as well. I really hope that we'll see that matchup in the post-season as well..  Well done, to both teams: The Yankees and The Red Sox!
