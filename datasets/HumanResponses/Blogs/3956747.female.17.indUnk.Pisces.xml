       Well, my sister Vera is coming to visit us in Hawaii. She lives in Italy where my father is from. This is her first time coming to America and hope she like here. My mom called and finally asked if I wanted to go shopping with her only if she promise that she won't have to go to work. She said i promise. So she picked me up and we went shopping!! After that we went to get our nails and toe nails done...we just had a blast!! I was sooooooo happy!!! This is like the first time my mom actually spend time with me. After that we went to a resturant for lunch and after that we did more shopping. We got sooooo much stuff. We probably had hundred bags!! For Dinner we decided to eat at my moms place and she is the bset cook ever!! We watched movies to. Then she asked mt if I wanted to go surfing on Sunday and&nbsp;I was like yeah! Anyway she is the one that tought me how to surf. I was so happy!! ever since my mom got her job she never had time to go surfing with me anymore and I can'r believe she asked me. Well, she has to go to work this week, but I can't wait until Sunday!!
