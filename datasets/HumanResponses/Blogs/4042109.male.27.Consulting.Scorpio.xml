        Wow. She replied. I didn't think she would. I'm stumped. What do I say? Jesus, I sounded like a dork in the message I sent her. Stupid! Should I tell her the truth? "I saw you in Eastwood and was wondering if you go out with me?" too fresh. "No we haven't met, I just saw you here in friendster" liar. "It took me almost 4 weeks to finally find you" too scary. Oh well, fine, I will tell the truth. "I saw you in Eastwood, found out that you work in the same company as my friends."

ksylverio: i say PI ksylverio: philippine islands suecutey: actually sweetie the abbreviation of philippines is PH and not PI ksylverio: i know hun it's just that everyone i knwo refers to the philippines as PI suecutey: well, ok suecutey: here it means another thing ksylverio: oh yeah the curse suecutey: well, you hear it, it sounds so strong right ksylverio: i think it's the way people say it suecutey: yup suecutey: the stronger, the better ksylverio: they focus their accent in certain parts suecutey: yup ksylverio: i also know to say gay in filipino suecutey: how come you know???? you know a lot huh? ksylverio: how come i know what? ksylverio: the accent you mean? suecutey: yup the accent ksylverio: the accent is something i observed suecutey: i cant believe that an american like you who grew up in the states would know so much suecutey: so much about the culture and things about mla ksylverio: know how to curse in filipino, i don't know how, i just know how it sounds and when i hear it i know that's it suecutey: scary right? ksylverio: yes scary suecutey: thats why the finger sign is nothing to us ksylverio: when people talk in filipino i listen suecutey: but you dont understand what they are saying ksylverio: no i dont ksylverio: i try suecutey: oops ksylverio: sometimes i feel the tone in how they speak ksylverio: and determine if they are mad or something suecutey: ya, it is just frustrating when you dont understand it suecutey: i ges across languages, we try to sense it through the tone ksylverio: yeah ksylverio: tone and body language suecutey: yup suecutey: are you adding another pic in your friendster ksylverio: what do you mean adding another picture suecutey: yes suecutey: picture suecutey: are you?

        Today I was able to chat with her. She was incredibly sweet as always. I still find myself in disbelief that I finally found someone who I am so in tune with. We share a lot of things in common. She is supportive, understanding and very caring. She carries her intelligence with so much ease that you can tell her anything. Sometimes I wonder if she knows how much I appreciate her just being there. I caught myself smiling again today. Only to realize I was staring into space thinking of her. What is wrong with me?

        Today is an unusually heavy day. Seems like the world is on slow motion. Hmm... I was chatting with her earlier and I am just preparing to leave for Baltimore. Our normally fun and very spontaneous chat seemed a little different. For some strange reason I felt like she was sad. She sounded different. Worried and very serious. I wonder why. Maybe she has a lot of things on her mind. I can't blame her. She had a long week and probably still tired from the overnight party she went to with her colleagues. It's almost freaky but I felt that she was so far away. Like the sadness you feel when you say goodbye to a friend who is moving to another place.
