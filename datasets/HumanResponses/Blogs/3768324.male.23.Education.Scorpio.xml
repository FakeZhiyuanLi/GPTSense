      I think when the school year actually begins in about three, four weeks I'm going to move this blog into a daily summary and analysis of teaching in an urban Texas ghetto. It might shape the direction of "Donna Martin Graduates."  As for the DNC, a collection of thoughts:    When my first child is in Kindegarten, his social studies curriculum will be highlighted by President Barack Obama.   Was Kerry's speech really that rushed?   Being a delegate in 2008 would be cool.   I thought the unity and the speeches were all very good, but hey... isn't it the same political rhetoric I heard in 1992, 1996, and 2000? Do these speeches ever result in change?   Why is it that all politicians try to shape their lives as common and meaningful to the average man, yet they're well-connected millionaires in reality?   Wouldn't you love to see a dude who drove to Boston in a dusty pickup truck win the nomination?   Does the GOP have an advantage by going second, and closer to Election Day?    Seriously, this is what I don't understand. Bear in mind, this argument is going to make me sound stupid, and not credible to discuss said topics. If you watch CNN and see a set piece where a Republician and a Democrat are interviewed about the same issue, HONESTLY they say slight variations of the same general theme. If everyone wants America to succeed, why can't bipartanship flourish in various governmental organizations? Why can't anyone say "fuck the sides of the aisle, I want America to succeed" and then actually mean it?  Ah, I'm naive...

      I promised myself I wouldn't put a lot of links in this thing when I started it, but here goes nothing, regardless. Look at this link, from Fox 26 News in Houston: &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.fox26.com/predator/HISD%20schools%20A.htm  &nbsp; I work in that district. &nbsp; Do you know there's an entire blog dedicated to whether or not Jessica Simpson's breasts are real? A valid topic, without a doubt... but an entire blog? &nbsp; 20 "bloggers" got accredited for the DNC next week in Boston. It's really a shame I didn't start this thing earlier. Ah, pipe dreams. &nbsp; As for the DNC, I'd like to see an unified, coherent message emerge and Kerry bounce to the clear frontrunner before Bush's 9-11 showcase in late August. I think Kerry needs a 30 minute speech - maybe as low as 25 - that emphasizes his credentials without bashing them over the heads of unsuspecting midwestern viewers, while explaining why these credentials are uniquely suited (or, say, moreso uniquely suited) to guide our nation than Bush's corresponding credentials. I think he eventually needs to address the inherent disconnect of most Dem. nominees for President - how can you argue for the resolution of "two Americas" (Edwards' big thing) when, in fact, you're chillin and windsurfin' on Nantucket ("where the millionaires mow the lawns of the billionaires") over the weekend.  &nbsp; Question of the Day Are Jessica Simpson's breasts real? (someone's gotta ask it)

      I moved this weekend. The most significant (or significantly depressing) thing that I realized is, without cable or Internet hooked up, I really had nothing to do. I read like 12 magazines, which I suppose is good (and I know that Lenny Dysktra is running an upscale car wash, which is interesting), but man, this digital age has really captured our generation. &nbsp; Here's a good one. The Phillipines are pulling troops out of Iraq to avoid one of their citizens getting beheaded, right? It's drawing international ire, apparently. I honestly haven't been following it that closely, but I believe that to be right. &nbsp; What if Bush's daughter was captured by terrorists (one of them is trying to go to Africa, where I believe anit-US groups operate)? Would he pull out US troops for his daughter, or keep them in for his nation? &nbsp; I bet some movie has been made about that exact choice, and I probably didn't see it. Regardless, if you had a good script, it would be a kickass movie. &nbsp; Martha Stewart got sentenced to five months in prison for her insider trading deal. Don't you think white collar criminals ought to do a "Robin Hood" style thing, and give a larger chunk of their money to the poor? I mean, what does putting a white collar criminal in jail really do? I don't think it does anything, frankly. Meanwhile, there's a growing national divide between the "haves" and the "have nots" which could probably be somewhat (miniscule, I know) fixed by making rich crooks give their money to lower-income districts.  &nbsp; Some guy on FOX News this weekend said regarding Farenheit 9/11, "If I wanted to see a fictional movie about a fat guy, I'd go to Shrek 2." I hate FOX News, but you gotta admit that's pretty funny. &nbsp; I think Kris Benson should go to the Mets, and Randy Johnson to the Red Sox. Meanwhile, no one's taking notice of Morris Peterson - on the verge of blossoming into a 20 ppg scorer - going to the already stacked New Orleans Hornets, who have an excellent coach coming aboard in Byron Scott.  &nbsp; When are these NFL preview mags going to come out? &nbsp;  Question of the Day  Consider the President Bush scenario above. What would YOU do?

      Has anyone ever stopped to think exactly what makes Paris Hilton a celebrity?  Is it because she's rich, does dumb things, and involves herself with marginal celebs like Nick Carter and Lionel Richie's heroin addicted daughter?  I don't really get it.  In the same vein, why don't more people from reality shows become famous after the reality show ends? Johnny Fairplay from Survivor is in pro wrestling now, and one of those other Survivor girls is on The View, right? And Eric Nies hosted The Grind after Real World I in New York. But come on. If someone like Paris Hilton can demand that much attention from the press, can't Brad Fiorenzia from Real World San Diego get his own show on CNBC or something?   I can't believe I just wrote that.  I've become mildly obsessed with The Real World recently, since watching 11 San Diego episodes in one day. The only Real Worlds I've ever followed were NYC (#1), New Orleans, and San Diego. I feel like I missed a lot of popular culture moments, fleeting as they may have been. It's a shame, really.  Diesel on the Heat. I wonder if they'll be good... and more specifically, I wonder how long until Pat Riley takes the urge to replace Stan Van. Ironic, because once Isisah takes over the Knicks, it'll be Riley vs. Thomas, which was once a prominent player vs. coach matchup in the late 1980s. Ah, things coming full-circle. Doesn't sports do that better than any other outlet?  Why is Jessica Simpson famous? Because she's hot, because she married another hot young rich person, because she's a singer, or because she's dumb?  Does anyone even really care that the NHL might get locked out?   Hilary (sp?) Clinton's aides are pissed she's not getting a prime time spot at the DNC later this month (shit, in 2 weeks). That's probably because she's gunning for THE prime time spot at 2008 (did they pick a site for that yet?). Ah, Edwards vs. Clinton '08... the Iowa State Fair will never be the same, 'specially if you toss Evan Bayh in there.  Question of the Day Behind the New York Times and (I think) The Washington Post, what's the best daily newspaper in America?

      I watched the Home Run Derby on television last night, after contemplating (for about 11 seconds) going to Crawford Street downtown and trying to catch balls. I realized I didn't have cash to pay for parking, and nixed the idea, which ended up being a good thing when I saw unbridled mob violence on one of Tejada's dingers.   And what the hell was the point of making that huge stage for the infield when Clay Walker did one song?  Anyway, Lance Berkman had 42 HRs and 128 RBIs in 2002, but since that was before I moved here, and thus before I cared about the Astros (and read their daily beat writer summaries in the Chronicle, for lack of anything better to do when my girlfriend is studying for MCATs), I didn't know a lot about him. His performance last night, even in loss, was magical. He ripped like 6 in a row to left field at one point, making small elementary school children sprawl over trying to catch the ricochet. He's got 152 career HRs as of now, and he's like my age. I think he'll get 500. He should start batting from the right side of the plate more at home, although I don't know how well he'd hit righty against live pitching. Tony Pena was tossing heat, though - and high.  Antonio McDyess on the Pistons. *Yawn*  I read this article - letter to the editor - in the Chronicle last night where a mother criticized some social columnist for writing an article about the decline of American parenting. The woman went off on some tangent about how she took her 2 children to California to see relatives, and they visited all these amazing sights and read books together and shit. Good for you, lady. I really do applaud your attempt to broaden the horizons of your children, but the woman who wrote the initial article wasn't talking about you. The fact of the matter is, the ghetto has always been awful for parenting... it's hard to blame those parents, though. A lot of times, they don't have a role model for what good parenting should be, and honestly, they need to work to make money for food and rent, so they can't always be with their child. Still - and I know you can find a survey to prove anything (that's how I got through college) - there's countless surveys that the average time UPPER MIDDLE CLASS parents spend with their children is decreasing on an annual basis, probably down several percentage points from the early 1990s. Interesting, given the relative absence of this debate in the recent political spectrum. Honestly, do you know how many NYC parents hire babysitters so they can go out, on a 6/8 weekend nights a month basis?   I'd argue being a good father is probably one of the most tangible accomplishments a man can record, and yet it can't really go on any resumes.   Do you ever find it weird how people are generally obsessed with things happening at midnight? Midnight Madness? Now there's a new movie series where classic comedies play at Midnight followed by group discussions or some such. And then, there's Midnight Basketball making a comeback in large urban centers (another attempt to keep kids off the streets, probably of a futile nature). Also, the term "midnight" is used in countless book and film titles. People are really, really obsessed with it. I can't tell if it's just the word, the images it conjurs up, or the notion of darkened secrecy.   Ron Reagan Jr. is speaking at Democratic National Convention, in prime time, about stem cell research. That's cool and all, but I bet Ah-Nold pops a bigger share / rating for the GOP in August with his prime time slot.   Question of the Day Is chilvary (sp?) among American males truly dead?

      So yesterday, I'm reading the Houston Chronicle Sunday edition, because the NY Times Sunday edition was sold out at the grocery store next to my girlfriend's apartment. The lead story on A1 is about America's presence in the Middle East (go figure) and this article is fairly long (who woulda thunk?) and continues onto like A26 or something. On the second page of the article, some US under-general says, "The roads are treacherous; there's bombs absolutely everywhere. These people have nothing to fight for, so they're just fighting to hurt us. There's no rhyme or reason to their strategy."  (I'm paraphrasing, by the way... I don't really know if that was the exact quote, but that's the jist of it)  Doesn't that seem like Vietnam to you? Let's see - a war halfway around the world that we don't necessarily need to be in, or, at the very least, don't need to be in ANYMORE... hmmmm....   Johnson was from Texas, right? And came to the Oval Office through odd means (that some would argue he arranged to happen... hell, some at Dealey Plaza argue that)?  Bush is from Texas, right? And came to the Oval Office basically because the Supreme Court was full of people his father had appointed?   Odd.   America is a fuckin' odd place.  Honestly, though, why are we still in Iraq? We've been hearing for months now that there's no connection between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, yet we've been hearing for years that Al-Qaeda masterminded 9/11. The thing is, now there's all this talk (headline on cnn.com) that Election Day might be postponed as a "Doomsday plan" or some shit... why? Because there's "intelligence" (vague, governmental buzzword) coming "from somewhere" that indicates Al-Qaeda might be planning something. Word, they might. You know how we could stop them? Address THEM instead of Iraq.   Anyway, since I don't know that much about politics, I'm going to stop discussing politics at this juncture.  Shaq on the Heat (if it happens) probably shifts the balance of power to the East, but the NBA Title is a race between the Spurs and the TWolves, with the Pistons, Pacers, and Heat slugging it out in the East. Get ready for this shit, though: the Nuggets ("Nuggs" to stoners) are going to get the 4 seed in the West, if not this year than next. Especially if they add K-Mart... you're looking at a 5 of Miller, Melo, Camby, NeNe, KMart... sure, doesn't SOUND like a lot, but believe me, they'll be good. Grizzlies haven't lost anyone, either. Expect them to only get better.   Jessica Simpson is going to be Daisy Duke in "Dukes of Hazzard" movie, potentially with Ashton Kutcher and Paul Walker. WOW. That's all which can really be said.  I watched about 11 minutes of "Ready to Rumble" last night on TBS late night. Extremely underrated film, if you enjoy films about professional wrestling. It's a notch above "No Holds Barred" and somewhere below "Beyond the Mat" (which I've never seen, but have heard is excellent).  Question of the Day What would happen to society if lawyers and teachers switched salaries?

      I hit up FanFest at the George R. Brown Convention Center today. Billed as a celebration of baseball, the several miles (I'm estimating square area) display features video batting cages and pitching matchups, Nolan Ryan telling parents how to involve their children in baseball, various guys from MLB Radio trying to answer MLB Trivia Questions (if you stump them, you win a shirt), and a bunch of other stuff.   It was really cool; despite that generic description, I truly think it summarized a lot about professional sports today. Sports is another, newer form of religion for some: it brings together people to pray at a common altar, if you will. For example, you ever see the overheard picture of when Horry hit that shot for the Lakers? The entire arena rises in 1 moment. That's seriously f'n holy. At the same time, sports is all marketing, which is sad. Every time I turned around, someone was offering me a beach towel, a duffel bag, or something of that variety if I registered for a credit card or signed some piece of paper. It got fairly annoying, to be perfectly honest. And, the whole "dealership" thing with regard to memorabilia was on display - 1/2 of the place was devoted to memory dealers, and you had to wonder if Jordan really wants his 1982 UNC game-worn jersey being sold for $1395. I don't know how it all works, but I've heard it's a pretty scandalous, backdoor operation.  Is baseball truly America's game? It's probably football right now, although that answer does vary geographically. And despite the international marketing success of the NBA, I don't think they have something like this... or maybe they do... you know, with their All-Star Games and whatnot.  Baseball is such a summer, family-oriented game, and Americans love the notion of "summer" so much (lazy bastards we all are), I suppose it makes sense that baseball should be America's game.  I played PS2 after waiting behind a series of small children for upwards of 30 minutes. It convinced me that indeed, I think I need to buy a video game system of some kind. The other thought I had was that I should become a fan of the Texas Rangers, or organize a softball team for my new apartment complex. It's funny how large-scale logistical clusterfucks make me think about creating other, larger-scale logistical clusterfucks.  I think I've also, gradually, realized that all I really need for happiness is a sports-related publication, air conditioning, and potentially something of an alcohol variety, although that's entirely contextual. I spent yesterday afternoon watching Astros vs. Dodgers and reading Sports Illustrated (the Manny Ramirez cover - the lead article, on Manny, was horrible, although 10 reasons why baseball is back was cool, if financially fact-laden) and it was utter bliss.  Question of the Day Is Miami the new hot spot of American sports? (This question boils down to: "Will the Dolphins be any good?")

      When Kerry and Edwards talk of "values" and then Bush and Cheney talk of "values" and correspondingly speak of "raising American values," do you ever get the feeling that they realize they're all truly on the same page, and just trying to be different for the sake of keeping up a national election?  Someone's planning a show called "Amish in the City," McDonald's recently got sued for its French Fries, and cnn.com interviewed UPenn frat boys about who they would rather do kegstands with, Kerry or Bush. It's good to know that the mainstream media frequently picks up articles from theonion.com.  Speaking of which, I've read Houston Chronicle the past 3 days basically cover to cover, and gradually realized that about 85 percent of their content is picked up from somewhere else...  Where the hell is Randy Johnson going to land? Boston? Schilling and Johnson, part 2... and yet somehow I think the Yankees will still win the American League. Or, honestly, the Rangers... man, they're playing some good ball. With Brad Fullmer - a guy I saw in A Ball - as their cleanup man. Expos retreads... ah...  The biggest sham about not being in college anymore is that it's harder to justify to yourself that you're a kid, so it's harder to do stupid things in terms of spending money. It's a shame, really.  Man, I'd really like to cover the minor leagues for a year or two... I bet that's the ultimate in human condition reporting.  Question of the Day Do you trade Shaq? If so, what do you demand for him?

      My office didn't have Internet for essentially 99 percent of the workday. It was hysterical to watch people justify their lack of work (myself included) because of the Internet being down. What did people do before the Internet? I really have no idea.  An old woman in my office was noted to tell a coworker with regards to a magazine cover, "Look at this Lindsay Lohan. 17, and look at these knockers!" I laughed my ass off.  Gagne finally blew a save. In reality, I don't care - the Dodgers still suck, except for Milton Bradley and Adrian Beltre. While Gagne is an amazing closer, he already killed this record, and at some point it had to end... it's just a shame it had to be to the DBacks, managed by Mets retread Al Pedrique.  I'm glad Edwards got picked, because in reality, could you see Tom Vilisack as President of the United States?  There's a segment on SportsCenter where some high school senior committed to Duke e-mailed Coach K about how much Coach K means to Duke. Apparently, this swayed the decision. Right. I'm sure the fact that the Lakers will suck next year also swayed the approach; I must admit though, the segment has tug-at-the-heartstrings potential.  Last night, I read a book called "What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know" which contained a diverse section on American history. It's amazing how stupid I am, in that I understood the Vietnam war better from a 3 paragraph description than I did from the months I covered it in HS social studies / history classes.  I watched a segment on ABC about life in the minor leagues last night. Amazing. Did you know Mitch Williams is the coach of the Atlantic City Surf? Amazing.  Is Dan Brown ever going to leave the NY Times Best Seller List?    Question of the Day   Is this approach of "Edwards was Kerry's 2nd choice, and his first choice is aligned with us?" going to work for Bush?

      I tried to post yesterday, but I don't think it worked. Basically, it was a convoluted stream of consciousness about how 4th of July is an overrated holiday.  I started thinking about that a little bit more on Sunday night, as I gazed at the stars in an outdoor park while straining to hear the Houston Symphony Orchestra. I think 4th of July can be overrated, but, like everything, it depends on context. The cool thing about it is: it's one of those days, each year, where you can really mark your life. "What were you doing on 4th of July 2001?" You'll probably remember. I'd argue it's that, your birthday, New Year's Eve / Day, and then one random event every five years, such as the assassination of a prominent figure or the death of a loved one. Milestone days, that's what I mean.  I'm glad Coach K decided to stay - better for college basketball in general, better for the ACC (which is trying to become a conference dedicated to big money football), and better for the Lakers (he would have sucked). Now, the Lakers probably take Rudy T, keep Kobe, and send Shaq to Dallas. Wow, the Spurs are def. gonna win the West next year - and mark my words, the Grizzlies get a top five seed, even with the Hornets entering the conference.  Not that anyone cares, but I'm saying if I was Kerry, my order would be: Edwards, Vilisack (sp), Gephardt.  Not that anyone cares, but where's Mario Cuomo's speech at the DNC?  4th of July really inspired a Norman Rockwell style bullshit spirit in me - you know, seeing kids frolic on a grassy plain and make up rules to their own games, seeing couples snuggle on blankets, and random 40 year old single guys with Coors Light bottles staring at the sky. 4th of July, in some sad and some amazing ways, really is the essence of America: laid back, detached, yet at the same time, oddly passionate.  Doesn't someone wish Michael Moore would make a documentary about NIKE and Phil Knight?  People are making a big deal of the fact that the NL All-Star outfield is Griffey, Bonds, Sosa. Woo f'n hoo. Check this: the AL infield? Giambi, Soriano, Jeter, ARod. Hehe. That coulda been this year's Yankee infield.    Question of the Day   Does the Koran truly justify violence?

      When I was like 16 and had nothing to do on New Year's Eve, my mom once told me that New Year's Eve is the "most overrated holiday of the year."  Statement has some creedence, even if it was only said to ease the depressing heaves of sighing from an adolescent. New Year's Eve is a bitch - you spend a lot of time planning to do something, you spend way too much money, and you're usually unfulfilled in the end result. Shameful.  But then take a look at July 4th - it's a cool holiday in that it celebrates our liberation from an oppressive tyrant (insert ironic lightbulb moment here), but at the same time, it's overrated in its own sense. The thing is... your actions on July 4th mirror your development as a human being. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? Consider it: when you're younger, you spend 4th frolicing with family, extended family, and neighborhood friends. Norman Rockwell would bust a nut over it. Then, you approach college years, and you spend 4th getting pretty drunk and eating undercooked hamburgers thrown together by a guy wearing college mesh shorts (maybe that's just me). You get older, and you spend it at the pool of your apartment complex.  Even though I'm making no sense right now, let's just leave it at this: 4th of July can be pretty overrated as well.  CNN is interviewing Vanessa Kerry and trying to pump her for information on who the VP will be. Better question: when your father invokes the word "values" every 48 seconds in speeches, what exactly does he mean?   I think golf is actually more interesting to watch on television than tennis.  Spider Man 2 gives hopes for a new generation of nerd filmmakers obsessed with comic book tales, even though Sam Raimi is by no means a nerd. I mean, can't we have more comic book megamovies that explore the soul of the superhero's alter-ego, ala Spider Man 2? I don't think "Hellboy" or the shitty 1991 Captain America movie really did that. I think someone needs to make a Silver Surfer movie, and really get to the core of what makes Silver Surfer tick as a human being and a fighter of evil. I also liked Captain America back in the day; if I ever became famous, I'd write a script for a new C-America movie.    Question of the Day   Are there any attractive male rappers?

      Last night on SportsCenter, I heard Linda Cohn refer to the 2001 New York Yankees (or, rather, probably the Yankees in general) as "the evil empire." Granted, and fair... the Yankees do use their incredible wealth - rather, the wealth of their owner - to pursue free agents ad nauseam, and acquire infields like Jeter-ARod-Giambi. I understand.  Still, I was a bit pissed off that Bob Brenly was painted as the new Luke Skywalker, defeating the evil empire. First of all, the 2001 Yankees weren't so bad, the DBacks had the best 1-2 pitching punch in perhaps the history of the league, and let me, for a second, reference the 9-11 factor. While I don't agree that New York "needed the Yankees to win the 2001 World Series," because 9-11 was less than 2 months prior, it's still something to consider. Don't call the Yankees evil. They're moderately evil, sort of like midwestern Republicians seeking a third Senate term. They're not horribly evil, like, you know, the Middle East. I'm just kidding.  In related news, Game 1 of the 2001 World Series was so boring that I spent most of the game watching Washington State vs. Cal, when Jason Gesser was QB of Washington State. Whatever happened to Jason Gesser? I think he's on the Titans.  Bill Cosby drew some ire for his comments on black parenting styles. While normally I wouldn't post about something like this, given that it's all over the news, and who really cares what I think, I do happen to teach in the inner city for 10 months of the year, so I feel I have a little bit of information on black parenting styles. Actually, I only had 2 black families in my class last year, and I thought they were relatively charming. There's a boatload of problems with American education, that teachers and teacher certification courses tend to blame on a variety of factors, most notably the "No Child Left Behind Act" of 2001, which actually leaves most children behind. The real problems are inherently institutional, and I don't know - nor am I smart enough - to figure out how to fix poverty.  I can tell you being President probably sucks 98 percent of the time, but 2 percent would involve being serenaded by Jessica Simpson on 4th of July. One time in Maxim, she said "My boobs always get in the way!" True. So does her stupidity.  I bet Dawkins is glad he didn't take the GU job, eh?   Can you really believe Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, and then as Batman?    Question of the Day   When Iowa Governor Tom Vilisack (sp?) says in his speeches, "I grew up at 401 Main Street," does it endear him to small-town America or make him seem like a clown forcing Norman Rockwell down our throats?

      Last night I was watching "The High Price of Fame" on E, strictly out of boredom / wanting my girlfriend to have enough time to study for MCATs. First of all, they voted Phoebe Cates' nude scene in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" (a thoroughly entertaining film, granted) to be the most memorable nude scene of all time. Total bunk. I can think of thousands of more memorable nude scenes. Halle Berry in Monster's Ball? Angelina Jolie in Sin? Kristin Davis in Sex and the City?  I checked out E Online because they had an ad for it (I'm a stereotype). They were selling Ted Casablanca boxers, which read "Put some sass in your ass." Uh.   I'm wondering - if Duke players suck in the pros, and college coaches suck in the pros, is this Coach K to the Lakers thing really that good an idea?  It's sad that Marlon Brando died, although not in a tangible, show-your-tears type of way. I'd argue Reagan's death might have been that, if only because of the overly intense media coverage of his laying in-state, transport to the Capitol, etc. I felt like a tool for shedding a few tears, but I did. What was I talking about? Oh yea, Brando. "On the Waterfront" is an American class, and so is "The Godfather." That one he made, 'Dr. Moreau's Island' or whatever it is, that was, in the words of The New York Times TV Guide, "a real pavement cracker." Sadly, he didn't age well, but I do give him props for his earlier roles. I should probably watch his turn in Streetcar, seeing as how I've never seen it.  Foxsports runs the headline "Suns grab super hot free agent." Steve Nash? Super hot? He's more burned out than a guy in row five at the Bob Marley Fest from running the Mavs' "We score 103, but we give up 110" offense for the past couple years. He'll probably do well with Marion, Johnson, and Stoudmire, though... if the Suns had room and got Kobe or someone, they could really shake some shite up in the West.   Is July 4th a more or less overrated holiday than New Year's Eve?  Why does espn.com list Adonal Foyle - perhaps best known as a staunch campaign finance reform advocate - as one of the 15 Best Free Agents on the market?    Question of the Day   Who should be the Democratic veep choice?

      Hey everybody.   ("Hey Dr. Nick!" - refrain)  You ever read blogs on the Internet and think to yourself (or, conversely, say to yourself, as I know I talk aloud), "Jesus, who cares what this dude thinks? I'd rather hear Chris Matthews discuss this!" Disgusted, you hurl your DSL cable into your Craig's List-purchased Popizon (acceptable spelling, although some prefer Papasan) Chair and turn on the TV, smiling brightly.   I'm not sure what I'm doing here. Not at all, really. But I figure it will take shape eventually. My promises, for now:  - Try not to author viewpoints on things I don't understand - Try not to post random links that take you places I wouldn't understand either - Try not to be an ass  Sh*t, guess that last one is already done for.  I know about three things in life: sports, pop culture, and using the Internet to find out random facts. I can tell you why "Igby Goes Down" is a modern-day "Catcher in the Rye," or dine with you over notions of why Grizzlies vs. Nuggets will be the Bulls vs. Knicks feud of 2010 and beyond.   I couldn't name more than 10 US Senators, although I'm mildly socially aware.   I didn't know I was liberal until I was just about 21; now I bask in the reflected glow of that narrow description daily.   I believe that if Donna Martin can graduate from HS, anything is possible.   I believe to become a well-read blog, I need a rotating hook. Let's try this: Question of the Day.

      First of all, why am I at school at 5:34pm?  I saw a teacher aide (salary hovers around $28,000 a year) driving an Escalade to school today. That's cool, but at the same time, slightly confusing.  Since I didn't post yesterday (out of utter fatigue and exhaustion), I feel the need to come through with some updates today. The "hell kid" (everyone has one) who I was supposed to get didn't show up on the first day... but oh... oh... on the second day, as I stood in the hallway talking to the other third grade teacher, I saw him bounding down the hallway, jumping at every EXIT sign. As my heart skipped 10 beats and my stomach fell about 11 feet southbound, he arrived at my door with a yellow entrance slip and proceeded to behave well for about 10 minutes, followed by being off-task most of the rest of the time. Now, through 2 days - about um, 10 hours total together - he's run over to the computer and signed onto Internet Explorer without permission three (3) times. Man, my life is a joke.  Just so you know, I stop him every time and explain why that's a bad idea, etc... I don't let it happen. But just the sheer incredulty of it happening, right? Or, you know, something.  Last year, I almost never used textbooks as a teaching tool, preferring instead poorly-crafted lessons that accomplished next to nothing. This year, I feel textbooks might be a more structured, fine-tuned approach to student gains. I have two things planned for tomorrow involving textbooks, and one is a magic square activity with single-digit addition. The sheer chances of this working are so SLIM ... naw, I guess I should remain positive on this blog, right?  172 days left.  What's wrong with Team USA Basketball?  When did gymnastics become so captivating?  Why am I more intrigued by preseason football than early pennant chase baseball?  What am I doing at school at 5:45pm?

      I've got this timeline type paper above my bulletin board (and hence my calendar) where I write what number day of school it is. It was glorious last year to write "175" on May 27th. Today, I just kept looking at the "1" and internally sobbing.  It wasn't so bad - teaching moves fairly quickly if you actually have an idea what you're doing, which I may or may not come the dreaded month of October. Still, despite a slightly underprepared first day, I came out OK, except for the muscle aches, hardcore fatigue, and desire to crawl into bed and never get out.  I had a little girl throw up twice today - she threw up about 8:20am, I sent her to the nurse... the nurse sent her back, she tossed her cookies again around 10:10am, I sent her back to the nurse... she came to lunch with us, didn't eat anything, and again she went back to the nurse... then back to me, said she felt sick... back to the nurse... finally, the aunt came and got her. You can't really prepare for that kind of stuff. I had a kid vomit on his desk during reading in my first year, then sit and stare at it as I tried to hustle him off to the nurse. Man, I never thought I'd write that last paragraph.  Tomorrow holds the promise of a reading assessment (a state reading test administered 2 years ago) which I will score and present to my principal. Funniest shit is, last year I did this, took about 3 weeks to do it, had no idea why I was doing it, and finally submitted it, never looking at it again. Hopefully this time I have some form of a clue.  Ah... Wednesday's the half day... it's almost here.

      Ah... the time is almost here. Day one of 175 geared towards attempting to give a bunch of 8 year olds a better stock in life, guided by rhetoric over realism, inspiration over facts, and determination and will over everything else.  I'll tell you - it's really hard. I don't feel a need to get all preachy here, because I definitely could, but what good would that do? Here's the thing, though. People talk about the differences between public schools and private schools, right? Private schools are obviously well-resourced, and have teachers slightly more dedicated because of larger pay scales. OK, those are the basic facts that would seem to distinguish a private school education from a public school education in terms of base quality.  However, here's something I was thinking in the shower this morning. I can certainly do a lot in terms of a classroom teacher this year - but, there's only SO much I can do. See, the kids have to WANT to be there, and need a framework for learning and understanding and paying attention. Because you probably have more affluent (thus, more free time) parents in private schools, the children have a greater framework for all those factors. I can make students WANT to be at school, and love being there... but I only have them for so many hours in a given day. During the other hours, they might be speaking Spanish, watching television, being unsupervised, or any number of other things. I think I need a more substantial parental involvement plan this year.  My points seemed more salient when I first crafted them, but I think everything seems more salient in the shower, if you really think about it.  With regard to James McGreevey, is the bad thing that he's a gay leader, that he lied about being a gay leader, or that he led his wife into a web of lies? I'm not sure exactly where the blame falls.  With regard to USA Basketball, was this team really such a good idea?  With regard to the MLB season, did anyone see this coming with the Cardinals? Jason Marquis? Woody Williams? And how did they get Larry Walker?  Last year before the first day, I was nervous, yet also excited and jazzed full of idealism. This year before the first day, I'm pacing myself for a marathon, and trying to keep things as simple and directive as possible. I wonder if that's a sign of maturity, or apathy.

      I don't really understand how my school publicizes Meet Your Teacher Day - they put it on the marquee in front of the school, sure... but what does that do? I mean, most of the kids that go to my school don't actually LIVE near my school (ironic, right?) Rather, because it's considered a halfway decent public elementary school (which has nothing - absolutely nothing - to do with my presence there), people list their grandmother or aunt or cousin as their permanent address, and thus get zoned for JW Oates. Hence, about 1/2 of our school is related in some manner.  Additionally, the coordinator of my school (essentially the Assistant Principal) had no idea how we publicize the event, which left me further confused.  Regardless, the point is... I always get burned on these things. Last year at "Meet Your Teacher Night" (a mid-September event), I got about 5 people. Last year at this event, I got about six. Today, I got 5. I got 1 girl that I taught last year - nice girl, very cute, dedicated to her family, but has something against effort. She almost never tries. See, if I knew what I was doing last year, I would have looked at her permanent folder and seen that all her previous teachers wrote "(Name) always says the assignment is too hard." I found that out the last week of school, after she did that to me all year. I should nurture her more this year - I got in her face a few times last year, yelling about how giving effort is more important than nothing at all.  In related news, I had one kid scream "I hate reading! I hate school!" while in my presence. I thought to myself, "Wow, should be a fun year..."  My room looks nice, I'll give myself credit for that (vaguely). I basically tried to be as simplistic as possible this year, as opposed to all the RAH RAH RAH messages I employed last year - "Together Everyone Achieves More (TEAM)" and "Work Hard, Play Hard, Get Smart." This year I'm just gonna teach, and try to avoid all the bullshit. I'll discipline when necessary, but if a kid can't deal with it - they usually can't - I'm just going to press ahead.  My question of the day should be, "Who tells these kids what school is for?" I guarantee you on the first day this Monday, about 8 of 15 kids in my class have a toy of some kind. Why? Why would you POSSIBLY need a toy at school, where you're supposed to "learn?" I don't remember bringing toys to school unless the teacher explicitly stated we could, but then again, I suppose I'm comparing apples and oranges, right?  Saw my girlfriend at lunch of her MCATs. I felt really bad, because the girl busts her ass day in and day out, and then doesn't feel as confident on the actual test. I hate it when effort isn't rewarded, especially long, pronounced effort. She's taking the second portion right now - I hope she kicks it in the ass, because she is capable of it and she deserves to succeed on that test.  Man, I can't believe school starts on Monday and doesn't end until May of 2005... wow...

      I'm almost finished with my classroom as of Thursday afternoon. Additionally, I've created a "Contest Corner" on one wing of JW Oates, allowing students and teachers to see contests open to elementary school students.  Innvoations this year - current events bulletin board, larger space for displaying student work, more tableclothes.  There's some odd, or perhaps not odd in the least, self-absorption at my school. I asked a few people to help me with things around my room today, and no one did. I ended up spending about 4 hours getting all this crap together, a time that probably could have been shaved to 2.5 hours if people had been willing to help. I understand, it was just sad.  I'm not really sure how to feel about this year, but I think I should wait to consider that notion until at least Saturday, when my girlfriend finishes MCATs. For now, I'll say I'm not digging waking up early or contemplating all the work ahead of me.  I haven't gotten fully hyped about college or pro football this year, nor have I really been following baseball, except for day-old results in the Chronicle. In many respects, I feel like a failure as a sports fan, but I still argue Georgia vs. LSU is the centerpiece game of the upcoming college football season, and the Cowboys will suck. Texans and Redskins will both be 8-8, and I have no idea who will win the Super Bowl (Patriots?).

      Day 2 back at school. Confidence gaining slowly.  Stealing an idea from my girlfriend, I think I'm going to make a "Current Events" bulletin board and attempt to incorporate it, somehow, with the "Morning Meeting / Message." The underlying theory is, even if I don't do it as successfully as I want to, it gives kids exposure to newspapers and magazines, and the purpose they serve. They probably don't have that exposure anywhere else.  I also think I'm going to use a "Journaling" approach, where students solve various problems in personal, self-designed journal notebooks, the theory there being that when you write down problems and the steps to solve them, you remember it all more.  Those two things, albeit simple, might make things a bit hotter this year (in a good sense).  Had a training this afternoon. While usually pointless, this training provided clear, usable information. I can't decide whether I think this information is usable because I know HOW to use it (because I'm a second year, and more makes sense) or because it actually IS more usable. I think it might be a combination of both.  My current MLB Playoff Predictions:  AL: Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, As NL: Braves, Cardinals, Cubs, Dodgers  Teams to Consider: White Sox, Giants, Padres, Rangers  I wish more news outlets would profile "key races" in the Senate and House, because I'd love to know more about those battle lines.

      The decimal reference in the title refers to Summer 2003, when I used to entertain my yellow school bus morning mates by telling us all what week, and what day, of TFA training it was (ala, Week 2, Day 3 would be "2.3").  I rolled back to JW Oates today, and immediately began the compare and contrast process between my life presently, and a year prior.  There were still various pieces of classroom furniture all over the hallways. Various faculty members were cracking awkward inside jokes. The place smelled the same. The really dedicated, determined teachers almost had their rooms finished. I was extremely tired. The meetings were a mix of cheer, boredom, and inane chatter (with some solid motivation).  In reality, the only difference was that I'm a year older.  Honestly, you ever associate a smell with a place, or a smell with a feeling? Every time I walk into JW Oates and smell it in late summer, I get this feeling... I can't really explain the feeling, but it's kind of like a mix of excitement and dread, almost the feeling you get when you reach the front of a 1 hour line for a rollercoaster. Like, you denied reality for so long, right? But then there it is, before you, and it's going to be cool, but also suck at points. I don't know if that made any sense, but I tried.  I'm teaching third grade this year, which means I have most of the same kids I had last year. This basically means I'd need to work harder in terms of establishing rules, procedures, and consequences, so that I can actually get some stuff done and not be bogged down by the behavior of my students. I was assigned this kid, whose identity I'll protect for right now (but probably not by 3 weeks from now), who has a long history of behavior problems (long history = ironic because he's only 8). Let's see how I do with this challenge. He exposed himself to girls at recess last year.  The background noise to this posting, ESPN (what else), just called the NFC East the "toughest division in football." Eh, I guess... but in reality, only the Eagles have a chance to win it. The Skins are a year away, the Cowboys have a 41 year old under center. The Giants, conversely, have a 22 year old under center, and the Cardinals... are they in the NFC East anymore?  As a final note, don't get me wrong as I keep posting about my life at JW Oates. Teaching may not be for me - I think this will gradually emerge as you read posts about my classroom management starting next week - but I do think it's a good thing to do for 2 years, and... I've met some tremendously dedicated, creative people who would be kicking ass and taking names in a variety of professions, but choose to dedicate their time and committment to this random elementary school off the eastern part of the Houston ship channel.  By the way, there's a school profile - and caricatures of old teachers - in the local McDonald's. Kick ass.

      I think I'm going to start moving this blog in a new direction: a summary of the bizzarre shite I see every day as a front-line member of the war on educational inequality. Or, basically, a recap of my days in the classroom.  If I changed the tag line for this blog, I might (if I was dork), write, "A blog with a LiveJournal feel." Fortunately, I'm not a dork - or at least not that big a dork - so I'll just go ahead and keep the "Donna Martin Graduates" title. I think the "graduates" thing makes a lot more sense now, doesn't it?  OK, so I returned to the inner workings of JW Oates Elementary on Saturday (yesterday). I didn't so much as return to the school site itself, as I returned to a nondescript building in Houston Heights, "The Houston Achievement Place." A team of about 10 workers guided the JW Oates staff through the "Project CLASS" training. Yes, in this case, CLASS is an acronym, but I don't remember exactly what it's for - Creating something or other, I think.  First off, I rolled up at 8:30am, which the e-mail about the inservice said was the time it started.  As I walked in, it turns out basically my entire faculty was already there. Apparently we were supposed to be there at 8am, essentially making me look bad in front of my principal, who already doesn't like me. Ah... then I go to sign in, and I'm listed as a third grade teacher, despite the fact that I thought I was teaching 4th grade, which is really charming because 3rd grade would indicate I get the same kids as I got last year... AHHHH.... wow. As I started having chest pains and thinking about all the things I'd have to overcome as a teacher of the same students I had last year, I realized that there was still a vacancy for a fifth and sixth grade math teacher... hmmm, I thought. Was it possible?  Quickly doing some investigative work, I put my odds of landing a fifth/sixth grade position at near 20 percent, so I decided I would draft an e-mail when I got home, but not before getting suffienct faculty support before I went through with it.  Meanwhile, as I stared at the cut-up green carpet and sighed deeply, I realized that at the front of the room, several 50 year old women were wearing sunglasses and dancing around singing, "Stop, Look, and Listen... it's the key to Success." I started wondering: why is it that people in education feel a need to make asses of themselves for a worthwhile cause? I mean, I guess Donald Rumsfeld once sang "Fly like an eagle" or "On Eagle's Wings" or something, so I suppose everyone makes an ass out of themselves at one point or another... but this seemed like a new version.  Then, one of the women presenting, who apparently was married to another guy presenter, made some joke about him getting spanked that evening, eliciting nervous laughter and awkward stares from a room full of inner-city, public school educators.  I really do respect teachers for how hard they work, and how much they sacrifice. I just don't know why, exactly, several half-century old women felt the need to revisit the "Men in Black" concept to model for us a way to teach rules and procedures to the class.  In totally unrelated news, I think I'd rather be enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame as opposed to the MLB Hall of Fame, because you get a bust, as opposed to a slightly 3D plaque. Um, is there a NHL Hall of Fame? It's probably in Canada, right? Or northern Michigan?
