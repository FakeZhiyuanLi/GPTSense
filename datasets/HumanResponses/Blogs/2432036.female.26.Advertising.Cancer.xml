      I'm sick and tired of people making up excuses to hit or punch or mame me. how could anyone feel the need to harm any part of my precious body?  I deny any wrong doing in the penguin anal lice incident. I want my record cleared for pete's sake. and who is pete anyway?  did he follow jesus' footsteps and create goodwill towards man? is pete a psuedonym for Santa? I want to meet this pete and take him out for some tea and scones.

      Maybe I wouldn't be concerned,Patrick, if the paper that I got the cut from wasn't covered in the weird, squiggly, origin-unknown curly hairs that are migrating from your pants.

      I am the gay magnet, the vortex upon which all things homo-centric revolve.  I was borne unto this life and I must embrace it.  So yes, I suppose I am a gay man.  You can call me Roscoe.  P.S. Brandon is my fiancé, not boyfriend, Paddy-cake, get it straight (

      I don't know if any of you have noticed but Brooke is the ultimate fag hag.  Three of her closest friends are known for their anal antics and the question arrises, is Brooke actually a gay man trapped in the vortex that is Straight-womandom?  She hides it well if that's the case with her designer purses, her cute as button boyfriend, her admiration for david sedaris and michael thomas ford....oh wait....SHE IS A BUTT PIRATE.

      Most people would not enjoy a terrible cold, but not Patrick.  He likes it because it allows him great access to excess phlegm.  Whenever he coughs, he collects the expressed mucous in a jar under his desk to be used later for lubrication purposes.  You know what I mean.  If you ever have occasion to meet Patrick do not shake hands.  His are filthy with sin and corruption.

      I just have to get this out in the open. there have been many times, not just once but many times that Brooke has asked me if she could sit on my face. I kindly passed and told her that I am not that kind of guy. she then proceeded to scream bloddy murder for the death of Elvis impersonator alive. I think we got a nut on our hands here.

      But I can!  Buy my cow stuff for your friends and family.  It is the perfect compliment to this holiday season.  Visit  urlLink cows by brooke    Alternately, you can buy my fiancé Brandon's  urlLink chicken   stuff (motto: Not quite as good as a cow)   We made these sites at the request of Patrick who likes to fondle cows and chickens.  He has an abnormal obsession with all animals beginning with the letter 'C'.

      I find very funny how Brooke has this innate sexual attraction to those rodent squirrels. She could go down on those little furry things for hours and never tire. God bless her stamina with fiesty animals.

      Hi there. You have just witnessed a historical event. I'm here as her other half of the raunchy duo and I am here to be as raunchy as I possibly can be even if it means beating down one of best friends in the process. Watch your back brooke because the real raunchster is here and here to stay.   by the way, it's true Brooke oddly enough does smell like a raunchy soup kitchen in the middle of Iowa and yes it is true that her friend Patrick (me) likes poop.   Brooke get your Beef Curtain away from me.  I'm gay goddammit!  Welcome again.  You will have so much fun watching us and we will too.  It's all just an act. we truly are amazing friends with a touch of raunch. our friends can attest.

      Hello and welcome to Raunchy Talk.  I am your host and Patrick is my side of fries.  Usually we have Raunchy Talk in the downstairs lobby of our office building, but we didn't get near enough exposure so here we are.  Some information aboout us!  Brooke is   always   better than Patrick at absolutely everything.  We are not related but we look freakishly alike.    We work in a building where the toilets never flush all the way.  I think that's all you'll need to know to fully enjoy Raunchy Talk.  It's been a pleasure to meet you and I hope to enjoy many more years together.

      Ahh bliss.  Patrick was out today.  He had a day off.  We here at the paper love it when Patrick has the day off, for it is like our own mini vacation.  Let me tell you about our day, none of which would have been possible if Patrick had been here, tainting our space.  9:00-9:45: Brooke and Lynn had a leisurely breakfast of Western omelettes and crescent rolls.  9:45-11:00: Nap  11:00-11:15:  Brooke and Lynn were very busy taking ads, but each of them racked up 20,000 in sales!  11:15-12:15:  Computer Games  12:15-2:00:  Lunch!  Because Brooke and Lynn worked so hard all morning they decided to opt for a hearty lunch of Tastee Subs.  Tastee does not normally deliver, but today they did as part of their Once Yearly Delivery Day Special!  When they got to the office and saw how totally hot Brooke and Lynn are, naturally their subs were free.  2:15-2:45:  Brooke and Lynn hide all the onions from their subs in various parts of Patrick's desk.  2:45-3:15:  Cocktails and dancing with the Tuscany Cafe delivery boy.  3:15-4:00:  Nap  4:00-5:00:  As an end of the day reward for all their hard work, Brooke and Lynn kick off early and use the last hour to wander the office and ridicule their co-workers.  Their unmistakable charm and witty comments are always a delight!  5:00-Go home to a warm bath and Merlot.

      I erased the blog.  Oops.  It's back on now, good as ever.  Just for the record, I did it because while I was trying to make a link to our  urlLink Raunchy Wear  , I was wondering why Patrick has such an odd shaped head and got distracted.  My sincere apologies, won't happen again.

      Ok, this is a funny story that we just remembered and must be preserved:  This past summer, Patrick and I were in his apartment and we were watching  Chicago  and doing gymnastics on the floor.  While we were watching I said, "How come everyone in this movie has a gun in their house?"  and he looked at me like I was a big idiot and said "Well it is New York, Brooke!"  That might not be funny out of context, but it had me rolling for days.

      Um.....Brooke just divulged something about my personal hygeine and I must admit it does happen from time to time but this is my business. Since Brooke has no disregard for her supposed friend's well being I'm going to stoop to her level and bring some information to the table.    We all know that I am not a woman. BUT, I am a man who menstruates. We all know woman have their times of the month when "Aunt Flo" comes to visit.  For some ungodly reason I have never believed in using any type of deterent such as Maxi Pads, Tampons, Douches etc. Now with this said, you know me and love me, but for 4-7 days no one honestly can't stand to be around me.  I get pissy and people run because they know whats coming. That's right!! Since I has this aversion to these implements of cleanliness you can just imagine the stench that wafts from my nether-region.  My jeans have this muave hue to them, my legs look wet with disgust and the smell is comparable to a fish market in the dead of summer.  Whatever you do do not go near me during this "period" of time. Thank you all for listening.   Note from the editor:  Patrick, don't you wish that you had the "Manage Posts" option?  Cause I have it for both of us :)

      But he is wrong.    Patrick came in today with a huge load in his pants.  Huge.  It was steaming and dripping out of his cuffs.  He walked around to everyone with a "Please change me" puppy dog face on, but no dice.  He has been sitting in it all morning and man is he stinkin'.  I think it might be from all the Olestra infused potato chips he eats, but God!  You're 25 years old, use the potty.

      "I have never had one complaint"......from brooke's mouth to your eyes but I am here today to let everyone know that this is not true what so ever.  I am here to make sure Brooke never infects any innocent men women dogs cats or any other mammal with certain types of sexually transmitted infections.  These infections are running rampant in this part of the state and I think we all know the reason for this situation.  Should someone feel the need to call CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) please feel free because this woman must be stopped and I think this could be the only way to do so.

      Because I am more popular that him.  Don't believe any of his crass remarks, for I take EXCELLENT care of all my service men.  First, we have Massaging Moments and I walk on their backs.  Then it's time for wine and truffles before retiring to the Canopy Room for chains and whips.  I have never had one complaint.      Patrick is a singer, did you all know that?    urlLink Want to see?    Buy his CD!  "Fish or Cut Bait" is my favorite track, but you can judge for yourself!

      In the past woman have had this angelic innocent quality attributed to them which makes them who they are; frail, beautiful creatures that can do no wrong in the eyes of others. Well, I'm here to say that Brooke has definitely broken to mold on that stereotype.  Why is that everytime an employee of any courier service, whether it be UPS, FedEx, USPS etc, Brooke feels the need to hunt them and force them to get under her desk and service her little Kitty until she says they can leave to finish up their routes?  I can't get over the fact that she disregards her fiance's charm and loyalty and just takes her sex addiction to insane summits.  Has she gone off the deep end with this tomfoolery? Leave your comments.....Is Brooke just trying to feed her sexual addiction or is she just a (a Paula Abduhl most beautifully exclaims) Cold Hearted Snake?

      Introducing the CHIA-PUBE, by Patrick Kelly!  The CHIA-PUBE is the perfect gift for this holiday season.  Patrick stumbled upon this idea one morning while observing the hair in his shower drain.  With regular watering, this hair seemed to grow!  After every shower there were more little black curly hairs in the drain.  Order CHIA-PUBE and Patrick himself will come to your home and take up to five showers in one visit.  Imagine the suprise on the faces of your loved ones as you lead them into the bathroom on Christmas morning to show them how much you care.  CHIA-PUBE does not need to be fed, but enjoys the occasional loving stroke.  Is your CHIA-PUBE looking a little 'drained'?  Call Patrick for one of three complimentary follow-up visits to keep it lush and healthy.    Call 1-800-PAT-PUBE to order now!  CHIA-PUBE!  By Patrick Kelly, inventor of PUBE SOAP!

      Yes I might once in a while feel the need to relieve myself at my desk and I admit that without any reservations.  I'm not the only one who has weird sexual issues that need to be dealt with.  Miss Brooke has this weird quark about her that kind of gets me uncomfortable everytime I look at her in the eyes.  I don't know if I feel comfortable saying this out loud but it needs to be said.  Whenever someone calls when we are at work, she feels the need to smother the phone with her love juices before she picks it up. it's kind of a ritual in order for her to get more business but come on, she's not the only one who has to use that phone godamnnit. Whenever she is out we need to pick up her phone and whenever I do I feel the need to vomit. People have rabbit's feet as good luck charms, well brooke has her ejaculate.

      He does this a lot.  Whenever he orders a sandwich from Tuscany Cafe and gets a glimpse of the delivery boy, he just goes buck nutty with the touching and the stroking.  He also does it whenever the paper comes and that ad with the twelve year old boy is in it.  He's twelve people.  Twelve.

      We better hurry though because I think Bea Arthur is getting too old.  I saw her on Broadway a year and half ago and she looked like she was about to die right there on the spot.

We are the same height and everything, it is an eerie DoubleMint moment when you meet us.    Our first guest.  Hmm...that's a thinker.  How about Bea Arthur?  Everyone loves Maude.  Plus, I bet she would let us stand on her feet and dance with her, especially if she is wearing one of her floaty frocks.

      Brooke's fiance Brandon recently exclaimed that her and I should have our own talk show either on the radio or television.  I pondered this idea and I think we should go ahead with the proceedings of making this possible.  Does anyone around here have any pull at any tv or radio stations in the area?  I promise you will get a cut of the revenue if it is put on the air.  Help two beautiful creatures catch a break in Tinseltown.  We'll be your best friend too.  Brooke, who would be our first guest?  I think it should be Courtney Love because we can make fun of her crack-head facade. LOL gotta love heroin chic.

Does anyone need a 5 lb stock of silly putty really.  Come on people.  Are kids that into Silly Putty like we are?  Are they trying to copy the entire New York Times with this thing?

      Hells no Brooke!!  I'm all about the sexual harrassment suits.  Just last year I had four hundred pending suits against me and my ever famous Willy.  My best friend and I are going places even if it is San Quentin.  Speaking of San Quentin, I've always fantasized about being someone's bitch.  The mere thought of someone taking me in their arms and putting a blunt object into my mouth to silence me just turns me on to high heavens.  Anyone out there have some leather they can loan me for the weekend?

      Well, Patrick, for me it is more of a game of dexterity rather than a device of erotic pleasure.  I enjoy seeing the many shapes that I can form with my putty and then smooshing them into an unrecognizable lump.  Try it!  It's hours of fun.  By the way, you got some putty hanging off of Willy there.  You know you should zip your pants at work.

      Whoever invented Silly Putty is a genius. Who knew it could be oodles of fun.  I like to take the Silly Putty and place on my nether region and see the inprint it makes of my beautiful best friend Willy.  Next time you have a chance to play with some Silly Putty try it out. It's fun for boys and girls of all ages.  If you're a girl it's extra fun. Right Brooke?  Why don't you tell our readers how you pass the time away with Silly Putty.

Lets meet up in ten years and see who kicks who's ass.  How 'bout 10:00?  Let's make it 10:30 but say 10:00 so that we will all get there on time.

      That's lovely Patrick.  Now, thanks to you, we can no longer print out these hallowed pages of our recorded youth for our children, lest they think us nasty perverts, which of course, we are.  And no more nut sweat, please.  My pores can't take the stress.

      Whats wrong with a chino tent. At least Willy works, right?  Willy is my best friend and we both like tight close quarters. Claustrophobia is not a sickness that him or I suffer from thank god.  His spitting does go a little too far though. It's kind of rude how much he spits when he gets hot and bothered.  I guess Willy's afraid of choking so to make sure he does not choke he needs to release onto anything he can including my fiance's face.    Now that i had the chance to explain my chino tent....Now onto more important things including Brooke's accusation regarding my hands and her face.  In my defense I'm only trying to mark my territory kind of like a cat does when she's in heat.  I'm just exclaiming in my own way of course that Brooke is mine and no one else can have her.  That is why i spread my nut sweat all over her face.  Is that wrong?  I'm a very protective friend.

      Ok, so the Chinese food was deceiving, because the dumplings that we had, pre-entree, were really delicious and I thought to myself, "What a delightful Chinese dining experience this will be!"  Then, I got my rice and ribs and the rice smelled like dirty dog feet which just ruined the whole meal.  I was forced to toss it in my trash receptacle and now the stench is wafting towards me in tiny dog feet puffs.  Gross.  So yeah, Patrick totally pissed me off today because, once again, he stuck his hands down his pants and then rubbed my face.  He does this all the time, like I really want his nastiness tainting my visage.  I don't know what he does with his hands when they're down there, so I can only imagine the menagerie of fluids that get caught between his fingers and under the nails.  Man, stop rubbing that stuff on me!  Gives me the vapors.  Also, he has to stop with the shameless flirting.  He is unstoppable when it comes to waiters and real estate agents.  You know when you start making a chino tent while you are on the phone with the realtor, you got problems.

      Today sucks ass! First off our chinese food we received for lunch tasted like sewage. Then, our boss decides to crank up the cunt meter and now Brooke smells like a dirty diaper.  What else could happen on this already raunchy day?

      Yea that's right!!  I lost my spunk but everyone knows why. Brooke's all trying to be all high and raunchy. Maybe I would be more inclined to be raunchy if Brooke didn't have to always steal my thunder and change everything i write in this piece of literature. She has all the power and is loving every glorious second of it.  Someone needs to finish her Monica Geller stint and come on my side for a little while.    You want my spunk back bitch? I'm gonna take back my thunder and let everyone in on a little known secret of Brooke's.  Sorry Brooke, I gotta let this out and this is the only way to do it since everyone we are around is incredibly sheltered and republican it seems.  At any point of the day you will more than likely find Brooke sitting at her desk with legs in  the air.  Weird, NO? The funny thing is....that's not the weirdest aspect of her being at this moment.   Toting an expression of both extreme release and pure beef thunder pounding coital bliss Brooke has proven to me that flatulance can be fun even if it comes out of the "cooter". Yes folks, Brooke enjoys her QUEAFS.  Are you getting me back for polluting the elevator with my own excess gas?

      Patrick is simply the most genius ad designer in the free world.  He had an ad that wasn't 'popping' enough and thereby not getting the responses it deserved.  The client called to see what could be done and after much discussion, they decided that a visual effect was in order.  See if you can detect the subtle nuance that Patrick brought to the table.  This is merely a dramatization of the actual ad, we are not allowed to use the real one, but you get the idea:  Ad #1                                                       INFORMATION WANTED                               Searching for information                                about gnomes.  Call:                                    732-985-2440   Ad #2                                                     INFORMATION WANTED                               Searching for information                                about gnomes.  Call:                          *******732-985-2440*******  You see what he did there?  STARS!  BRILLIANT!  In the oddest place possible!  Let's all give him a big hand!  Note from the Editor:  That's Patrick's real phone number, so you can call him if you want.

      In case you needed to know what Patrick wants for the holidays:  He likes big balls.  He likes them with sauce.  He wants to eat 'em and lick 'em and mmmm get them all over his face.  Send Patrick your big balls and make him happy.  I know it's past Christmas, but it's not too late.  For Patrick, big balls are the gift that keep on giving.

      I know, I know, no raunch for many days.  I am sorry.  I was struck down with...(bum bum bum) The Killer Death Flu.  I don't know what Patrick's excuse is, but maybe we will forgive him since it was Christmas and all.  I spent Christmas laying on my bed since I was unable to move for several days, so raunchy thoughts were in short supply.  I did have some NyQuil induced hallucinations and a period of hysterical sobbing on Day Three of Killer Death Flu, but in general I was in a fairly dormant state.  I am hoping that with time, the raunch will return to me, but for now I am a dry dusty well of un-creativity.

      Patrick is at the dentist today, having a wisdom tooth yanked.  Let's all say a little prayer that he survives.  True gross story:  I just came from lunch and I had to pee really badly.  I run to the two stall bathroom and lo and behold, there is someone in my favorite stall.  Forced to use the other one, I go in and sit down.  There is total silence from the other stall as it is very obvious that when I sat down there was only about 6 inches and a wall separating us.  Very tight stalls.  Anyway, I let 'er rip and after a few moments the next stall does too.  So we are peeing, peeing and after a normal amount of time she stops...gets up...(I'm still peeing)...washes her hands (still peeing) dries them (peeing) and then just hangs out by the sink.  I am mortified that I am peeing 50 times longer than this woman and I don't really want to meet her, so I finish up after, no shit (pun intended), 2 solid minutes and then I am trapped in my stall til she leaves.  How much does that suck?

      It wasn't a turd it was an Atkin's friendly candy bar. I know they can look alot like shit but no Brooke had to overreact and run around screaming. It could not have been m,y turd because I have not shit in a couple days as a result of my Atkin's binge.  I wish I could do the number two but i cannot. anyone want an atkin's candy bar?

      Patrick loves to act like a monkey.  He is always monk-monk-monkeying around and we all think it's kind of funny how he runs around scratching himself and going "hoo hoo hoo!"  But honestly, it's gone too far.  During the morning rush in the office today, Patrick told me that he had a surprise.  I was pleased, as I enjoy surprises very much, as naturally I would.  He disappeared for a moment and returned with his hands behind his back.  "Pick one!" he said, with obvious glee.  I chose one and it was then that he tossed a huge turd in my general direction.  Only my keen reflexes allowed me to escape untainted.  He only had the one turd, but I remain fearful that he may strike again.  I have coated myself in plastic to avoid potential contamination.    Patrick, you are not a monkey.

      The true Raunchsters are backing us up!  Thank you all for your undying support.  It's Omelette Day here at Raunchy Talk.  Omelettes all around.  True gross story:  This morning I was standing, talking to Patrick and preparing to take my sinus infection medicine which are huge horse pills that I have to throw down my throat.  I threw it in and then before I was able to take a drink of water, my throat rejected the pill and I let out a huge BRAAAWWP sound from deep inside me.  Patrick turned purple, he was laughing so hard.  Did I mention that we ate omelettes today?  Omelettes.  For lunch.    Omelettes.

      Patrick just called up the local deli and wanted to know, how much chicken salad was enough for two people.  Does anyone out there care to venture a guess?  The real question should be, "How much chicken salad is enough for two people who are on Atkins and can't eat anything else?"  The answer then, of course, "How many chickens have you got?"  I would like to take a moment and salute Frank's Deli for giving us this bounty of poultry for lunch.  Thank you Frank.  I love you.    Some raunch!  Ok, ummm...well, we got two complaints thusfar regarding our site.  In summary, they are:  Complaint #1:  Your site is not raunchy enough.  (Actually cited to be "clean as can be")  Complaint #2:  Your site is horrible and will corrupt the nation's youth and must be destroyed before it infects the entire population with it's yucky words! (Spurred, no doubt, by Patrick's New Year's Eve pinapple post)  My conclusion to these remarks is that we are doing a perfect job.  Humerous commentary, with a generous dose of nasty wit and a dollop of twelve year old potty humor.  We like it.  If you don't...well then don't visit us, we don't like you either.  On a final note, if you are a new Raunchster to the site, do not judge. We invite you to read ALL the postings.  There are some gems that are readily available through our archives.  Please start at the beginning when we were baby raunchies, and see our progression.    Plus, don't mess with Patrick man, he's a mean one.  Cross him and he's liable to give you a shot in the eye courtesy of Willy!

      I guess whatever brooke says we do.  Consumed:  1 Glass of Water 1 Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese removed (as brooke has) from bun with cheese sloppily falling off onto my hands. 1 Super Size Diet Coke (yes I'm thinking I'm Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female with how I copy even Brooke's meal) Numerous Salami wrapped in romaine lettuce 2 Eggs made into Egg Salad with Hellman's, Dijon Mustard and pepper to taste. Crystal Light of unknown quantity. (see another single white patrick moment - I gotta copy her word usage too)  Feelings:  High-level fullness, wanting to throw up. Lips red from the tint of the Crystal Light Raspberry Ice drink that has plagued my existence with unwanted and unwaranted obsession.  Time remaining: We'll say 2 months but probably three more hours.  Weight loss this far: Do you count weight in brain cells because I think I lost a couple in the last couple minutes: you figure it out Progress: Fuck you Brooke,  for putting this idea in my head.

      Consumed:  1 bottle (20 oz.) Diet Pepsi Twist 2 IceBreaker mints 1 Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese removed (with skill) from bun with cheese fully intact 1 SuperSize Diet Coke Water of an unknown quantity  Feelings:   Mid-level fullness, rather non-descript.  Slight protrusion of the stomach in a bloated way but feel that amount of carbonation is to blame.  Slightly sick from handling burger meat in hands to eat.  Continuing water progress and allowing sugar-free mints.   Time remaining:  5 months Weight loss thus far: 0 lbs.   Progress:  Encouraging.

      I'm just commenting on Brooke's last post. She was singing this song at the very last ten minutes of the day this afternoon at work. How can you be bored Brooke? I mean we have so much fun looking up lynn's skirt, video-taping Lynn fooling around with the new guy in the supply closet, and peeing in Lynn's cubicle. Jeez I think we have loads of fun.

      What is wrong now-a-days? Um...I think certain tv show's are "wrong".  But what is wrong? wrong is a certain amount of intolerance of a complete foolhardy display of  human unintelligence. With that said, Why do i feel like every Real World "character" (and i use that word loosely) is completely wrong? Especially the last five seasons.  These people are supposed to be paradigms of our generation and i feel like they are mocking what we have to say.  And whats with "the apprentice"? Looks like a bunch of wanna-be Sheepherders.  Ok, I'll get off my soapbox for now. I don't know that came from. I'm never a barker of political chatter.  Anyway, i sometimes have dirty thoughts involving white out, a tube of chapstick and a bar of soap. is that "wrong"?

      I put this poem on my other  urlLink blog   and suffice it to say that it was not well received.  I think I might have targeted the wrong audience.  I think you all will appreciate it much better.  Allow me to present: Blue (by my best friend Neal, who wrote it eleven years ago when we were 14.  He's at Columbia for his PhD now.  Once you read this, you will see why.)   Blue   Blue is a color. It is a very nice color. It symbolizes calmness and sereneness. I like calmness and sereneness. It makes me calm and serene.  Water is blue and water is nice. It quenches one's thirst quite wonderfully.  Sometimes I like to be naked and paint my whole body blue. It makes me happy.  It also makes Mr. Happy, happy, which I have to be careful about. People usually think it's funny. And I like to run around in the park when I'm painted blue.  It doesn't mean I'm feeling blue. But is also reminds me of the Smurfs. I like the Smurfs.  If you have enjoyed this random moment of poetry, please let me know.  There is lots more where that came from.  Among our hefty cache of prose there is also "Green" "Yellow" and "Cookies".

      Everyone in the office today has had the same lunch.  McDonald's cheeseburgers with no bun.  We rolled up the meat and ate with our hands.  I had five, Patrick four and Lynn three.  We all smell like raunchy old McGrease right now.    Now for a topical observation that some may hate me for.  I was not going to watch  The Real World .  I have not sat down and followed a full season since way back to Seattle.  During my visit last night with my fiancé, I ended up watching two episodes of the new San Diego-ers and I have to say it was one of the more entertaining things I have seen this year thus far.  For those of you who missed it, let me provide a short recap of the events:  Episode One:  Everyone Gets Drunk and All the Girls Cry 'Cause They:(Choose your own option)  a.) Ain't Got No Man For Lovin'. b.) Have A Man but Now Developed a Debilitating Crush on One of The Cast Members and Hey, Chemistry Is Chemistry. c.) Are At Such A Difficult *Point in Their Lives.  *(This is the most overused phrase in all of Real World/Road Rules history.  "You know, I'm just at a point in my life where..." blah blah blah.  Yeah, you're on TV, living free and easy without rent or a job.  We feel for you)  Episode Two:  This was the doozy.  I came really close to committing a random act of violence after I saw what the main thematic element was.  Are you ready for it?  Here we go:  The gang needs to have a "job" while they are living in their big ol' house.  They live in San Diego,  on a pier .  Their "job" is to learn how to sail.  Ok.  Flash to lip ring girl.  Lip ring girl is not happy.  This is because she is...... afraid of big boats .  Huh.  Not afraid to go on a boat.  Not afraid of water.  Just can't look at a big boat, but for terrifying spasms of debilitating panic.  Right.  I would like to flashback to pre-production of this show.  "Hmm....we are going to be in a house, on a pier, in San Diego.  What, oh what, can I say that I am afraid of so that I can ensure that I get the maximum amount of attention?  It has to be something sure to be found by the beach!  Water?  No, then I couldn't have pool fun and frolic.  Sand?  No, then I couldn't sunbathe.  I got it!  BIG BOATS!"    If she really is afraid of big boats, why the hell did she agree to go on the show at all?  She knew there would be boats of some capacity in the surrounding area and she would be forced to   look at one.  I am afraid of snakes. Terrified.  I cannot look at them.  You would not be able to walk me past one.  Therefore, if I was asked to be on a show in say, the jungle, or even the desert, I would say no, for fear of potential snake encounters.  But to live on a pier, willingly, and then say you are afraid of big boats.  Gimme a break.  Feel free to write me long evil comments on why I am the devil for speaking ill of the sanctity of the Real World.

      I will send a dollar to anyone who can tell me where that quote is from (Not you Brandon.  I know you know the answer, don't go ruining it!)  Patrick told me today that I am a huge egomaniac because sometimes when I post I make myself laugh so hard that I can't breathe.  Well Patrick, I can't help it if I am really, really funny, can I?  You are just a stick in the butt.  I don't know where I am going with this post and still, I am typing.    I am trying REALLY HARD to figure out how to post links to pictures on here but so far, no dice.  If anyone has any tips, please share.  I have some hideous and frightening pictures of Patrick that will curl your hair.  He is a horrid little gnome, all gnarled and warty.  He can't even stand up straight, but for the hump on his back.  Gives me the shivers.

      Because he called me a big fat hog.  I was standing in line for the water cooler and he shoved me.  I lost my balance and fell down and then he stepped on my hand and said, "Outta my way big, fat hog!"  I started to cry and so he spit on my face and then sat on my head and farted.  I tried to get up and run, but it was too late.  He had already gotten out the ketchup and mustard and was squirting them all over my nice new dress.  I put out my hands to defend myself from the red and yellow streams, but he bit my fingers until they bled.  I was crying too hard to tell him to stop and he was laughing and laughing.  Finally, he peed on me and walked away.

      Yes it's true, I had one of my wisdom teeth pulled on friday and surprisingly I was in no pain.  The experience was truly surreal because for the first time my "in case of emergency" person came to my rescue and I loved every moment.  The fact that my fiance took off work that day made me so freakin happy to have an "incase of" that is not my mom.  I never thought I would have that luxury. I guess you just have to chalk it all up to the fact that I give him great head so he has to be my "in case of". and yes I do give great head.  now with my wisdom out and my jaw a lot less tight i will be able to give even better head.  Oh I can't wait til it's fully healed. :)

       urlLink This   is the funniest thing I have read all day.  If I had only known that you could sue someone for putting a condom in your food, I would have lassoed Patrick's ass long ago.    Since I am the diet guru and also the conduit for the deceased Dr. Atkins, I would like to let him address a recent letter sent to me:  Dear Dr. Atkins, I am going to try.. i stress the word TRY your wonderful atkins diet.  However,  i will probably not give up my veggies or fruit.   The reason I am writing to you is I am going food shopping after work and I would like your help in creating my shopping list.   Here's some helpful hints about me.   I like to pig out at night, and I always seem to get the munchies ;)  Please advise what snacks, etc I should buy.   Thank you Dr. Atkins.

      I have a new entry on  urlLink Malarkey  if anyone cares to read it.  This will take you to the main page, just click on Malarkey on the left sidebar.  Read my archives!  Doing so may induce severe eyeball hemorrhaging, but those are the chances you take.  If you read "Brooke and Neal's Top Tips for Successful Mattress Moving" there are some lovely pictures of me, sweating my ass off as I move a mattress out of NYC on the hottest day of the summer.  If you read "Happy *#&*$ Holidays" there is a picture of my puppy.

      True Tale of Terror:  Last night I was driving home with my fiance Brandon and we were about two blocks away from his house.   At the intersection before his street there was this old dude standing in the middle of the street waving his arms around trying to stop the cars.  We're thinking that maybe something is wrong, so I slow down and he comes to my window and goes, "Oooohhh!!!!  WHOOOO!!!!!!"  He was crazy!  I drove away and he started running after the car, going "Whooo!!!!!" and I was screaming, "He's coming!  He's coming!"  Brandon was yelling, "Drive away!"  We had to drive around the block a few times til he was gone so that we could park and get into the house.  Then Brandon scared me and told me that it looked like the guy had no hands and he was probably screaming at us to help him find his lost hands.  I am suprised that I didn't have horrific nightmares from that.

      My friend Lauren is the coordinator at the company that I used to work for. She is in charge of sending out a lot of memos and company-wide e-mail and such. When we worked together she would always get upset when I corrected her spelling. After what she sent to me this morning, I decided not to correct her any more in case of future errors such as this one. This is priceless (It went out to everyone in the building):   From: Lauren T.  Sent: Friday, January 23, 2004 9:06 AM  To: Staff  Subject: 1235 Building- Lower Level Heat  Importance: High   Good Morning All,   The problem is not with our heating system in the lower level of the building, it is a gas company related problem. Steve is working on it with the gas company and heat will be restored as soon as possible.   Thank you for your patience in this matter and we  apologize for the incontinence.   She sent this to me with the header: "Check this out.. can you see what I did wrong... damn spell check!"   I damn near had some incontinence myself.   She is going to hate me for this.

      Patrick and I are going to see Rufus Wainwright in a few weeks.  We love Rufus.  I was driving and thinking and thinking and driving in my car the other day in a highway-induced haze about how I needed to mention our Rufus tickets on the blog and then BOOM!  Instant fantasy moment.  ~~~~~~~dreamy haze and whooshy music~~~~~~~~  At the concert:  Rufus is telling us how much he appreciates it when people write nice things about him on their websites.  Then he says:  Rufus:  You know, I have to tell you about a site that I came upon.  It's called Raunchy Talk with Brooke and Patrick and they were kind enough to sing my praise.  Everyone should visit them!  (Surprised GASP! from the audience)  B&P (from the audience):  That's us Rufus!  Raunchy Talk is at your concert!  Here we are!  Rufus: No!  You're kidding!  Is that really you, Brooke and Patrick?  B&P: It's us, it's us!  Rufus:  Why don't you come on up here and help me sing "A Bit of You?"    And we do.   That's my sad little fantasy.  Rufus, if by some cosmic miracle you actually read this, WE WILL BE AT LAKEWOOD ON FEB 11TH!!!!  WE LOVE YOU!!!!

      Patrick has fallen off the wagon and it drove away without him.  He went off Atkins.  After all his big talk, he didn't make it through Induction.  I am shamed by you, Grasshopper.  He chose the perfect time to end it too, let me recap for you, our Friday night:  We go to the movies to see  Big Fish  and he purchases a big ol' tub of popcorn, which he devours all through the movie.  Then we go to Quick Chek for post-movie snacks.  I am majorly PMS-ing, but I didn't know it because Lynn pulled an evil woman maneuver on me and changed my cycle (yes boys, we can do that).  I obviously can't have anything good. Patrick being oh-so-compassionate decides that he wants Pop-Tarts.  We had a brief conversation:  B-Thanks A LOT Patrick!!!  You KNOW I can't eat anything and you are going to get THAT????  I WANT CANDY!!!  P-You can't have...  B-I KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  P-Why not purchase this $5.00 lump of tasteless, sugar-free, brown, chocolate substitute filled with glue and woodchips?  B-BANG!  P-My head!  And so on.  So since Patrick is an evil boy, who taunts pre-menstrual women, I have decided that he must be castrated whilst he sleeps.  I will pay $500.00 for any party who can ensure successful penis removal, brought to me, in a box with a ribbon.  Any takers?

      Who can figure out my super cool secret code???  I apologize in advance for any lameness that you may encounter in this post.   Today is a low day.  Mundane.  I sit here, at my desk, pondering, pondering.  Where is the magic?  What of my life?  I see my Diet Pepsi sitting here.  Sitting...sitting.  The deep mahogony liquid has slipped below the ice blue label and sits...sits...in mellow coolness waiting to encounter my lips.  Waiting...waiting...but it will not wait in vain, oh no!  In a moment, I will drink.  Where have all the staples gone?  My stapler lies empty, with no chance of replenishment if not for my own two hands.  Oh no.  I sit.  I sit.  Waxing and waning are the thoughts in my mind, "What of this day?  This cold, dark day?  What of my Diet Pepsi?  Liquid coolness, mine for the taking."  Meandering thoughts that are me.  Me.  All me.   Thank you!  Thank you so much!  Please, feel free to use the above dramatic dialogue for any upcoming auditions that you may have.  Really, you're too kind.

      It really sucks big time, doesn't it?  You think about it, you have warm, thick mucus oozing down your throat into your stomach, unless you are lucky enough to cough it up while it is still hanging around in the old esophagus.  While it's in your stomach, mixing with all your food, sometimes you manage to puke it all up.  Other times, it just hangs, creating a warm wash of nausea every time you move around.  Did I do it?  Did I out-gross Patrick?

      In lieu of the recent postings regarding flatulence and the general anal area I must bring up something that always cracks me up whenever it occurs.  Being a gay man, I must put up with certain occurances that may be kind of taboo to some other people.  One such occurance cracks every time it happens because come on, you can't take life so seriously espcially when it comes to flatulence. I've been sexually active with my boyfriend/fiance since we met over two years ago.  Now, my partner is a dream to myself and most gay men because of his superior endowment.  Sex with him is always fun and incredibly enjoyable.  But with the size comes a consequence that I was not prepared for after our first consumation.  I had awoken the next morning, showered and left for work.  At that time, I was working as a waiter so I always had to be on my toes and moving constantly with no time for idle chit chat.  Well, while working my double shift at this restaurant I noticed one thing about my being that I could not control.  I would walk around doing my usual serving duties but with no warning my flatulence would leave my body emitting a waft of deadly odorous stench. For some reason my ass was so strecthed from my partner that I could not hold my gas in.  Is this a usual gay man's crisis? To me it just cracks me up that I'm walking around not knowing that my gas is killing everyone around me. Any comments?

      I have fielded a lot of questions regarding Patrick's lineage from people who want to know what makes him so raunchy.  I am happy to report that I have some exclusive pictures of Patrick's relatives for your perusal.   urlLink Check it out!      Also, let's all beg Patrick to tell us his loose anus story, regardless of the fact that he is afraid that my mom will see it and not like him anymore.

      We gay men have to stick together because we're always going to have fag hags like Brooke trying to bring us down. The reason why i resort to scat play with Brooke is the fact that Brooke has this fascination with placing her dirty maxi's on my shoes so that I trapse gross menstrual juice all over the office.  I had to finally fight back with my own excrement.  Is it wrong to fight back?    PS thank you Josh for your comment. It's always nice to know there are other Butt Pirates out there who enjoy our raunchy humor.

      There have been a lot of odiferous emissions from Patrick's side of the room today and it is starting to wear on my nerves and the inside of my nose.  It's one thing when he throws turds at me, I can duck those and the maintenance people take care of it, but when he starts with the gas, all bets are off.  You can't contain it and it floats freely with it's sulfer-esque stench.  I tried to slip him some Beano the other day, but he was on to me and ate Five Alarm Chili and a plate of broccoli for lunch.  It's gotten really bad this afternoon because each time he lets one rip he gets a little brown splotch on the back of his white Z. Cavaricci pants.  It's no fun to work with Patrick when he gets like this.  At least I know that by opting for gas today, there is no hope for a solid turd.  True Gross Story That I Just Remembered!  Ok, so a few years ago, I worked in an office and one of the women that worked there was about 150 years old.  She had a daughter that also worked for the company, but not in my building.  One day, I am in the lunchroom and she is talking to the room as a whole about her daughter's recent doctor visit.  I swear that this is the actual monologue and I further swear that I was eating chinese food while she said it. (Roast pork in brown sauce):  "So my daughter went to the doctor this week because she was having a problem with  diarrhea .  She had been having a lot of  diarrhea , so she went to the pharmacy to see what she could get for her  diarrhea .  The pharmacist told her that the best thing for  diarrhea  was this new  diarrhea  medicine that would stop your  diarrhea .  She took the  diarrhea  medicine and she was still having a lot of  diarrhea , so she went to the doctor for her  diarrhea  and he told her that the best thing for her  diarrhea  was to stick to bland food and he gave her a prescription for  diarrhea  that would help her to stop having  diarrhea ....."  If she said the word once, she said it fifty times.  I don't know which was worse, that I was eating roast pork in brown sauce while she told this story or the fact that I personally knew her daughter from the other office and now all I could picture was her sitting on the pot with a major case of the shits.  I had to quit soon after.

      Ironic words coming from the queen of filth.  You would not believe the amount of shit that Brooke consumes on a daily basis.  She's like my dog for Christ's sake.  (Yes my dog literally eats shit but never his own.)  Brooke comes to work and immediately does a B-line to the bathroom to see if anyone has left her some tasty treats.  Lynn tries everyday to keep her co-worker pleased when she comes in but Lynn can't always hold it in til she gets to work so thats when she breaks out the Glad-ware at home so she can at least save it for her.  Anyway, Brooke spends at least a half hour huddling over the womans toilet devouring every ounce of feces she can feast on. She sometimes sits and waits in one of the stalls until someone decides to come on in and use the facilities.  She waits there extremely impatiently longing for the taste of digested cud.  Finally someone strolls on in, sits next to her and lets out a pre-poop poof of air AKA a big ole fart.  This is when Brooke makes her move...."Psst.....psst.....can i have your poop?"

      DO NOT speak ill of the sanctity that is American Idol.  I am such an Idol whore, I absolutely love it.  I am not one for reality TV that much, but I am completely obsessed with AI.  I even sat through part of American Juniors and that was  really  bad.  Ohhh, got the burpies.  Patrick did you hear that a few minutes ago when someone was hocking up a big loogie (sp?) outside our door?  It was gross but I was going to tell you to have them spit it out so you could catch it in your mouth.  You are so good at that!

      I have HUGE BREASTS!  Yes, it's true, I have a big fancy pair.  Patrick always talks about his nether regions but I have yet to do so.  It's no fun being a big boobed girl, I'm sad to say.  Maybe because I am not a big person, when I wear certain clothes I look out of proportion.  I also have no ass to speak of, so that doesn't help me much either.  This week I have the itchy boobs.  All you girls know what I'm talking about.  Winter comes and you get all dry and bingo!  Itchy boobs.  I tried to explain this to Patrick when he asked why I was fondling myself.  He has sisters.  He understood.  There.  I feel better now.

      I don't know anyone named Conrad, but I have a little earworm going on.  BLAUGH!  BLAUGH!  BLAUGH!    BLAUGH!  What is wrong with me today?  I don't know.  It's a weird mood day I guess.  Maybe I am happy because it is sunny today!  It is 40 degrees!  BALMY!  Plus, Patrick did not throw any turds at me which always puts me in an upbeat kind of mood.  Patrick does have a major stiffy today though.  All day long, he poked me in the ear this morning.  I told him that he should wear looser pants, but does he listen to me?  No.  Reminds me of a guy I went to high school with who I called BigFat(insert name here)  I can't tell you his name, cause that would be mean.  Let's call him BigFatLouieMeyer for now.  If your name happens to be Louie Meyer, this is not you.  I did not attend high school with anyone named Louie Meyer so we're safe.  Anyway, BigFatLouieMeyer always had a monstrous erection.  As the name fortells, he was a big fat person.  With a big fat pole in his pants.  It was disturbing.  My friend Neal said he must wear silk underwear to get constant results like that.  That's a tip for all you boys and hermaphrodites out there.

      I will now end the controversy.  The reason for the big bad Superbowl boob flash is, of course, Patrick's fault.  You see he is a HUGE JJ fan and right before the show he attacked her backstage and licked her boob.  That caused the pasty she was SUPPOSED to be wearing to lose it's adhesive grip and become loose.  When the breast plate was ripped, well we all know what happened.    Patrick, please.  You are supposed to be a self-respecting gay man, I don't think it's appropriate for you to go around licking breasts, I don't care who they belong to.  This was a low, and now a federally investigated stunt.  Way to go.

      And I don't even drink.  But that's the kind of day Patrick and I are having.  We were just given detailed instructions on how to fold a piece of paper so that, when inserted into an envelope, the address shows through the window.  Cause, you know, we're five.  It's Friday the 13th (whooo scary music!). Tomorrow is Valentine's day (whooo dreamy music!).  I don't last remember when two such major holidays fell consecutively such as they do this 2004.  Tonight though, tonight I will relax.  I have not yet fully recovered from staying up so late on Rufus night and I actually slept through the alarm this morning, a rarity indeed.  Not to mention, it's Friday, which is my Major Television Night O' the Week because Friday is  Monk  night.  I love  Monk .    Anyway.  Have an Ol' Creepy Friday the 13th today and a mushycutieoohilovethemflowers Valentine's Day tomorrow.  Smooches

      So last night was the night!  It was Rufus night!  There was a whole lot of mayhem and excitement both at the concert and before/after.  I have broken it down into a series of high and low lights so that you can fully appreciate the fun time we had.  (The stars are for you Patrick)  *My car, containing my mother and my sister got stuck in hellacious traffic and while stuck in said traffic we picked up a carload of little Homey G Slices who leered and catcalled and proceeded to follow us for the next 25 miles.  We counted.  *Patrick's car, containing Brandon got there first and Patrick managed to randomly locate two people that he knew in the space of five minutes, one of them being his old roommate.  This was particularly impressive, seeing that they happened to find them on a corner in a town 40 miles from where we live.  *Once we got there, Brandon and Patrick had already arrived and were standing on the corner.  They told us to go straight for parking and I completely ran a red light, which fortunately did not have any severe consequences.  *We had unbelieveable seats, fifth row center, about 10 feet from the stage.  My sister, who is a certifiable lunatic, decided that she wanted to take pictures which was against the expressed wishes of the theatre.  They caught and yelled at us for this four times before finally stationing an usher at the head of our row to keep her from doing it again.  *Patrick and Brandon were in the upper tier front row and Patrick reported to me that my sister and I were highly visible because we had the brightest blond hair out of anyone in the audience.  I only hope that Rufus appreciated it as well.  *Patrick and Brandon had prime seats to see this girl totally bust her ass when she tried to walk through a velvet rope partition.  *My mom, sister and I had prime seats to see the lady next to us let out a random catcall and whoop when they played the Gay Messiah song.  Even Rufus was perplexed by her outburst.  *FINALLY!  The mother of all injustice.  While I took the whole damn crew out to eat, Patrick hung out outside the theatre for a few minutes more and he got to MEET RUFUS!  I didn't believe him, but he had a signed ticket to prove it.    It was a magical night.

      Brooke had to leave early from work today. Apparently earlier yesterday she contracted a nasty case of cauliflower ear from the mats at excercise class.  Her ear looks so delectable I just want to spread some French dressing and munch away.

      You know what's better than foreign porn?  Cartoon porn!  The worst porn I ever saw was one that I bought for my friend Amanda because she was depressed.  I went to Dave's Adult World with my friend Charles and we chose one which met our strict criteria of being less than $20.00.  Reason being, it was obviously made is someone's backyard and the 'characters' looked like everyone's middle aged next door neighbors.

      Anyone ever see Porn from a different country?  Well, if at all possible please download a clip from any foreign porn for the sheer hilarity.  There's something about dirty talk in a different, especially German or any Germanic Dialect, that just makes me scream with laughter.  Ich Bin Bigge Schwanze!!!

      Once again I have proved that two cans and one bottle of diet soda before noon is too much.  I got dressed up pretty today with my skirt and now I am all a-puff.  Patrick is being a grump today, he threw a paperweight at me, narrowly missing my left temple.  He's mad because I told him that we are too small to be dancers.  Every day it's the same thing, "Brooke, let's run off and be dancers." and I tell him, "Patrick, we are too small to be dancers, but we might possibly make good cheerleaders."  He doesn't want to hear that, so he throws things at me and then he starts to cry and bang his head against the floor.  I hate it when he gets like this, because sometimes he knocks out a tooth and the blood gets on my desk which calls for major disinfection.  Patrick, I don't want to dance with you.  I don't want to catch you and lift you high in the air.  I think that it is stupid to practice the five ballet positions every morning.  No one does the Cabbage Patch anymore.  The doctor has asked you several times not to breakdance in the bathroom, I don't care how slick the floor is.  Patrick, you are not a dancer.

      Dear God, I am so bored.  Patrick is off being a hooligan in the Poke A Nose and Lynn is off to whore herself out all over the gym, so where does that leave me?  All alone in my cube.  Boompboompadoop.  Let me tell you about a dream that I had the other night, as I am anxious for interpretation.     Whoosy music....dreamy haze   I am watching  I Love Lucy , and Fred and Lucy are having sex.  What could that  mean ?  It has had me freaked for days, I can barely function as a human.  I keep having horrible images of big ol' fleshy Fred with his Humpty Dumpty pants all groping Lucy.  What would make my subconscious come up with something like that?    Gives me the shivers.

      That just sounds bad.  Anyway, Brandon would like to say something.  Brandon?  I'd like to clarify this particular episode of Raunchy Talk. I don't want anyone to think i'm a freak.  Already Josh thinks i'm an insane pervert.  I don't want him to think ill of me. To re-clarify Brooke's statement, I was satirizing the appeal of this lisping Englander (Jamie Oliver) and his disgusting concoctions and the bevy of british ladies he has "over at his house" for "dinner" on every episode. He thinks he's so damn cool! Well, guess what Oliver! You're not! Your food looks rancid and I can't stand the way you talk! I love to cook but i'll never try one of your recipes! Here on this comment board I am announcing a new club for people against This pseudo-TV Chef. PAJOAHS (People Against Jamie Oliver And His Sluts) is blazing the trail against hip young lisping British chefs on TV and the women who love them. For more information on PAJOAHS, visit your local library or log onto "Raunchy Talk" for regular updates from me.   Signed, Brandon HR Director PAJOAH

      I don't know if you have to know Brandon to think this is funny.  He is fairly low-key and much tamer than I am, which is why he didn't really appreciate the new feature on Raunchy Talk  urlLink Ask Brooke's Fiancé A Question About AutoErotic Asphyxiation!!!    (Have you asked him one yet?  Do it, do it!)  I don't know what the hell was wrong with him last night.    We were watching the TV Food network as all great couples do.  First we watched Good Eats with Alton Brown and then we watched Jamie Oliver (AKA /The Naked Chef.  Patrick didn't know who the hell I was talking about when I called him by his real name.)  So we're watching Jamie Oliver and nothing extraordinary was happening and then Brandon started getting weird.  On the show he was making Japanese food, we were informed, for two girls that were coming over.  Brandon found this hysterical and starting pulling innuendo out of everything.  You need to read this with a British accent.  Brandon is good at the accent:  *Clarification from the Editor:  He was doing this impression AS the Naked Chef, not as himself, Brandon.  I think that was unclear prior.  Brandon would never bang Japanese girls on the TV Food network, but rather he was implying that the Naked Chef would.  That being said...  TV: "So you just need to pound these out..." Bran: "Yeah, just like I am going to pound those girls"  TV: "If you don't have a mallot just pound them against the table" Bran: "Yeah, just like I am going to pound those girls against the table.  I'll bang em and bang em."  Me:  "What the hell is wrong with you?"  Bran:  "I'll bang em and bang em up against the table and then I'll get more people over and bang them too!  Bang everybody!"  TV: "The seaweed is slippery so..." Bran: Yeah, just like I am gonna be when I start banging those girls!  Haw haw haw!"  It got worse and worse.  I had to give him a pig nose (too complicated to explain) to make him quit it.    I knew he was a Raunchster at heart.  He said he is going to start a new blog, "Dirty Talkin' with Jamie Oliver".

      Speaking of the porn shop that Lynn and I solicited this afternoon.....I love Adult Novelty stores.  I'm like a kid in a candy store whenever i freakin enter one.  I always dream of a Willy Wonka type deal.  "The Horny man can cause he mixes it with cum and makes the world taste good. " If that was the case, I'd be freakin Augustus Gloop...chomping on all the butt plugs and dildos. Then I fall head first into a vat of semen getting sucked up into a giant Phallic Tube.  Ah the dreams I have.

      Fuck her!!  Everyone has every right to be upset if they did not have a wonderful Valentine's Day.  Thats the point of V-day in the first place.  Either you love it because you have someone or you hate it because you don't.  To all my brethren who wanted to shoot everyone on the street for having a "wonderful" V-day, I salute you!!  Even though i had a Wonderful V-day with my fiance, I do agree that V-day is such a crap day that we are forced to celebrate if we are "attached".  It is a sure fire sex fest though so i cannot complain. :)

      I won one, after consuming only about eighty bottles of Pepsi.   I hope everyone had a splendiferous Valentine's Day. If you didn't have a Valentine, please don't be sad.  Just remember that some of the greatest members of this glorious nation that we call, simply: "The United States of America" were at one time, wee little babies, and everyone knows that babies, having fairly low awareness, don't ever have Valentines (unless it is a baby with the kind of parents that send it's picture into the paper with a heart around it that says, "Happy Valentine's Day to our lil' Pooh Bear!").  On a general level however, babies are non-romantic.  Yet these babies, who are now, as aforementioned, great members of our glorious nation, managed to succeed regardless of being romantically unloved at a young age.  Chin up buckaroo!

      So we have a brand new look.  I really think that it just POPS and screams, "Look at us!  We have no time to get a really cool background so we use this one!"  I was bored of the pea green though, it reminded me of the crust that is always stuck around Patrick's nose.  Anyhoo.  My florist's father died, which has put me into a pensive mood.  I called to find out why I never got my wedding contract and I was told that they were out of town for the funeral.  This got me wondering, is it really convenient to be a florist when death hits you?  I mean, you know the family had to have called her up and mentioned that since she is coming to the service anyway they should save the family a few bucks and bring along the greenery.  That's gotta suck, but I can also see them not saying anything, in tact, and then being pissed when she shows up empty-handed.  "So you didn't bring any flowers, huh?  We thought, you know, since you are a  florist    and all, you might have thought...oh well.  I guess we'll just go pay for the flowers that you could have brought for free."  Anyone out there a florist?  Is that how these things work?

Does he know how many gay people there are out there?  How many friends of gay people?  C'mon man!  Get with the stats!  See Pat?  I agree with you.  Possibly for the first time ever.

      And so does Jamie Oliver!  Last night, in an attempt to further prove the mission statement for Brandon's new club, PAJOAHS (People Against Jamie Oliver and His Sluts) we watched the show again and it was all about cheese (or 'cheesth').  The main featured dish, was a lump of dairy called something along the lines of Dutch Stinky, wrapped in proscutto and baked in the oven.  I very nearly lost control of my bladder when he removed this lovely from the oven, brought it to the table where his sluts were sitting and squeezed it in what I can only refer to as a 'pulsating motion'.  The bacon split on the side and white 'questionable' fluid began to not just ooze but shoot out, much the same way the male organ ejaculates upon reaching orgasm.  Raunchy Talk has reached a new and scientific height.  You can't watch that show and not admit that Jamie Oliver is running some kind of underground culinary whorehouse.  Brandon knows it's true.  Want to join PAJOAHS?  Call 1-800-NO-SLUTS and ask for Horace.

      Wouldn't it be fun if President Bush got anal warts? If Marriage is so freakin sacred then why do we have the highest divorce rate in the world? And what if a straight man beats on his wife? is that a sacred bond?  I am getting so tired of these two-bit low life politicians dictating who I can or cannot marry.  You are forgetting about the 13-15 million gay men and women in the world who most likely care more about being with the one they love than any other straight couple.  Straight people of the world, please don't take your wife or husband for granted because at least you have the law on your side.

      I need  urlLink this   product.  Look at the dramatic demonstration and tell me that you don't need it too.  Patrick is being a nasty little shit today.  He is mad at me because I kicked him in the nuts when he came into work today.  I had to do it though, he walked in, all nonchalant and let me tell you, his face was just  begging  for it.  You can imagine my surprise when he suddenly doubled over in agony and cursed the seed that created me.  I don't know what to think anymore.  Maybe he should go back on that mood stabilizer, I just can't deal with him lately.  He went horseback riding this weekend and ever since then he is going on and on about how he was getting all woody during his ride.  Did you ever think, Patrick, that the next person who rides that horse might not want to have your pineapples all over them?  Do you ever think?

      I don't know what that is supposed to mean.  Man, I just ate a salad that had more cheese on it than God ever intended one person to consume in a sitting.  I am probably going to have severe gastric reciprocation later on in the day.  I will let you know how it all 'comes out'. Har har.  Patrick went home because he has a fever and a feeling of general pukeyness.  God, why am I writing this stupid post?  I ought to be calling apartments and begging them for housing.  That's on tomorrow's agenda.  That's right my lovelies, I will not be around tomorrow, so let's see a brave face and no more tears ok?  Josh!  Send me your address so you can get a dollar for WINNING MY FRAGGLE CONTEST!!!  WHOO HOO!!!    I tried the Atkins ice cream last night.  It was Creamer-ific!  I need to go home.

      Patrick, Lynn and I were reminiscing.  Don't you just love Fraggle Rock?  Once I was in a store with my friend Lauren who is two years older than me and there was a Fraggle shirt and I freaked out, "Look!  Fraggle Rock!"  and she had  never heard of it!   I can't imagine what kind of childhood that must have been with no Fraggle Rock.  My sister is only 20 and she remembers it.  Here are two fun quiz questions!  Answer them right and I will send you a dollar:  1. What was the Trash Heap's name?  2.  What did the Doozers make their construction materials out of?  There's a dollar on the line!  Get your answers in quick!!!

      Today is a proud and momentous day.  Patrick and I, but for a brilliant idea conceived only in love, mind you, nailed Lynn's ass to the floor.  Lynn is the ultimate prankster so for us to have gotten her was no mean feat.  Her favorite thing to do is to send horrible e-mails from either me or Patrick to each other and then watch us go at it.  The scheme we devised yesterday for her was so simply inspired I was almost moved to tears.  The set-up:  We sent her an e-mail while she was out yesterday letting her know that a new client was going to be sending her some text for an ad that needed to be proofed.  The device:  We printed up a phony fax cover sheet that Patrick created and I only wish you could see, it was so perfect.  The phony law firm name we dreamed up?  "Wisniewski & Allen, P.C."  The text:  I wrote out the ad and it went like this:  Associate  Growing Woodbridge Law Firm is seeking an associate to join our expanding practice.  The right candidate will have 3-5 years experience in Matrimonial and Real Estate law with admission to the NJ and NY Bar required and ERISA experience a plus.  Must be adept at court appearances and other public and private functions. Experience with defense in necrophilia and other sado-masochistic clientele is also required. Must demonstrate the ability to deal with and sympathize to a number of fetishes including canine and amphibian excrement ingestion. Must possess excellent writing and communication skills. Please submit resume, writing sample and tongue length (in inches) to:  The clincher:  We had Brandon's mom fax it to us from her job while Patrick and I were both in the office with Lynn so as not to be suspect.  The best part was she typed  the whole ad  into our system before really finding any of it weird.  When she started to say "Listen to this sentence I just had to type for this ad!"  we just lost it.  Such a good gag, I dedicate this day to us, Brooke and Patrick, as the day we stole Lynn's crown.

      Lucky bitch. whilst Brooke and I are slaving over New Jersey Lawyers asses Lynn is at home enjoying her day off....look what she told us she was doing...  Dear kids,  Your boss has probably lost 25 million pounds, 2 small countries, and 50,000 immigrants – with all the pooping and puking I have done for the past 12 hours! Aren’t you glad I told you all that!  ~ Lynn  Now, you can't tell me that that's not fun fun fun till Daddy takes your T-bird away.

      I have said it before, but let me reiterate:  I get drunk about once a year. Always at events in my own house or at Brandon's.  I got drunk at a bar exactly one time and that was three years ago.  The reason I do not drink is because I am very very bad at it.  One, two, three drinks, BOOM!  Asleep.  I hate to waste the money.  With that being said, I present to you my True Tale of Horror on Friday evening.  Brandon had an art show, and in attendance were our friends Jim and Jess and myself.  After it was over we went out to eat and I picked up a bottle of Merlot, because whenever we hang out with Jim and Jess we always have red wine and play cards, as we are already pathetic old people at the ages of 25 to 27.  My red wine ratio is usually one glass to about 6 glasses of diet soda.  I like to keep a sophisticated palate so I always have the one glass to keep the aquired taste.  Friday night I upped the stats and I had four.    I was trashed.  On four glasses of red wine.  At 10:30 p.m.  Jim and Jess went home after awhile and Brandon was left to deal with drunken me.  I wasn't falling down or pissing myself, mind you, I was just getting a little swimmy headed and needed to lie down.  I lay down.  Brandon got me a little something to eat and a whole lot of water.  We watched  Monk .  I solved the crime.  I fell asleep for a few minutes.  When I woke up I felt very refreshed and sober.  It was 1:00 a.m. Brandon had also fallen asleep.  I hated to wake him so I went home, which is about 5 blocks away.  When I got to my house I was hit with a blast of cold air that sent my guts straight down to my knees.  Very very sick to the old stomach was I.    "Ohhh!", I said.  I went into the house and stripped down to my tank top and underwear and got into bed.  Now, I have always, since childhood, slept flat on my back.  I am not comfortable on my stomach, I like to be flat on my back with no one touching me.  Brandon knows that I am not a cuddly sleeper, I need to be my own island.  So I was all stretched out on my back, feeling groovy enough.  I put my TV on and conked out.    I am so lucky I didn't become a statistic.  Exactly 30 minutes later, my TV snapped off because I set the timer, I sat straight up and proceeded to vomit into my trash can six times.  I threw up so much that if I had stayed laying down like I was I would not only have choked to death but it would have blanketed my whole body.  Up and up and up I threw.  When I was spent, I lay panting on the edge of my bed.    Eventually I picked up the garbage bag and stumbled down the stairs.  My mom was there.  I became 5 years old.  "Mommy!  I threw up!"     "What's wrong?  Are you sick?"  "No, I am really drunk!"    The next day I tried to get up several thousand times, but I only managed to lift my head and gag slightly.  I was never so hungover in my life.  It lasted all day into Sunday.  I am a bad bad drunk.  Thank goodness I have reached my quota for the year and I won't have to go through that again til 2005.

      ANTICLIMACTIC!!! Yes, I do think that some of the winners deserved the award but come on, you think we didn't know who was going to win everything after the first hour of the show? It was so boring that my fiance fell asleep during it and for all of you who know my baby, he does not fall asleep when he is engrossed in a show or movie. Nothing ever bores him but for god's sake Hollywood, stop the insanity!!!!!!!!  Speaking of stopping the insanity, I miss Susan Powter. She was so lesbo-riffic with her shiney flaxon locks of 1/4 inch hair, sitting Indian-Style on her arm-chair because she could. She was a genius much like Richard Simmons back in the 80's.  Yes I do believe they are genius'. How else could a diet guru make so much money?  Come on, you don't think Ron Popeil isn't a genius.  He was king of Infomercials in his day. He's probably reitred on his yacht as we speak sipping Clamato Bloody Mary's. What I would not give to be an infomercial solicitor.

      I am really bored.  Patrick and Lynn went off for manicures (that is totally true.  Should you ever meet Patrick you can point and call him a sissy-boy.  You can call Lynn 'Funky-Fresh which is her rappin' name).  I was just in the bathroom and I observed that my skin is so white that the veins in my wrist are almost purple.    Ok, now for the big deal of my day.  I am saying a little prayer that my brownies come today.  I ordered some  urlLink Fat Witch   brownies as prototypes for possible wedding favors and they should be here today.  Brownies!  Huzzah!  Oh the Nasty NumbNuts are back.    Ooh!  Funny story!  I am fierce with a rubber band and Lynn was mean to me earlier, so when she wasn't looking, I shot her.  She was drinking out of a can and I whizzed it right between the can and her eyes, but  didn't hit either one!   Scared the shit out of her!!!!  Heeeeehehehehe!

      Hey Guys,       I think you need to know what's been going on with your significant others while they are here at "work".  There have been not one, but many occasions where I have seen some things that I didn't want to see and a few where I was forced to see things that I really didn't want to see. I need to end my silence.  I can't sit by and idly watch the stream of male hookers that are filtered through the "office" every day.  Lynn and Patrick...they are insatiable.  There is no telling day by day what freaky thing they will be craving.      Lynn has her favorites.  There is Horace, the 350 pound bus driver.  She likes to wait until he has finished his 3:15 final dropoffs and then he comes over here so she can suck on his armpit hair.  There are also Tito and Voltan, the Russian machinists who always drop in on Wednesday mornings.  I don't know the specifics of that ritual, but they always arrive with a tub of mayonnaise, fishing hooks and specimen jars.  Every Thursday is Pitsy day.  Pitsy has full body boils that can only be lanced by the Majick Teeth of Lynn.          Patrick is bad in his own way.  We order lunch here every day.  Why?  So Patrick can jump the delivery boys of course.  They try to put up a fight, but when he has the stun gun, there isn't that much they can do.  This afternoon I was waiting for the elevator and almost run down by the Chinese food delivery man.  He tried to outrun him, but Patrick...man is he quick.  He was on him in seconds flat and when Patrick puts noodles in his ass, well they all know it's up to them to make sure they come out, so as not to make him angry.  Angry means doing the pumpkin dance.  God!  I can't think about the pumpkin dance!      Please, for your own sake, help me to help them.  Together, we can put an end to this madness and make the world a safer place, devoid of these sexual miscreants.  I can bear the sin of knowledge no longer!  Yours, Brooke

      Patrick and Lynn have been SO MEAN to me today, for no reason at all.  I mean, I know they are jealous of my charm and wit, but, c'mon, there is no reason for them to dish out the kind of abuse I am putting up with today.  I have a little message for them:  Patrick: I don't care where you think you are getting a bald spot, I am not touching you there!  Lynn:  You can't see my menus.  You can't see them now or ever again.  They are my goddamn menus and that's why I hide them.  From the likes of you!  Furthermore, the next time you receive a note from me with a drawing of a hand giving you the finger you better take it for what it is.   A threat.  I know where you live and I have access to live pythons.  That's all.  I hope you are both happy for making me get flustered and lose control on the blog for all the world to see.

      You know, to the unbiased observer I must look like I sit around and watch MTV all day.  I don't, you know....I am a very intelligent girl.  I graduated from college and everything.

      I am really upset, because for the first time in...ever...I was unable to finish lunch.  I am not the type to leave food uneaten and I am shamed and saddened by my failure.    We got a  urlLink raunchy tip   from a new Raunchster.  Thanks  urlLink Hotbeef   for the link.  La la la...I have so much snot in my head it's coming out of my ears.  La la la.  Maybe I will take up a hideous drug sniffing habit and un-deviate my own septum.  I don't want to have a nose job, especially after what I saw on "I Want a Famous Face" the other night.  You know, those guys...they didn't look like Brad Pitt at all, but you know, they   really thought  they did.  It made me sad.

      I came into work today and immediately had to take a mean shit after drinking only sip of the disgusting office coffee that we are forced to drink if we do not want to cave in a purchase some dunkin donuts delectables. Well, to make a long story short, I felt like I was smelling my dinner last night because it was this pungent aroma of beautiful onion rings from King of Burgers. After this morning I don't believe I'll be getting Burger King onion rings ever again. maybe not that extreme but you get my drift. By the way, whats up with the stupid high school reunion shows?  do people really get off on ruining lives?  It's so sad.  I would not be caught dead dating my high school sweetheart ever again.  Well, she was a girl....LOL

      I know.  It's been ages.  I am sorry to report Raunchsters, that I have been very ill.  I am still very ill, I am just ignoring it now.  I have bronchitis and the mother-of-all-sinus infections for which I have my third doctor's appointment tomorrow.  Know why?  Because they think I have a deviated septum.  Know how they want to fix it?  They want to break my nose and then re-shape it in a new fun way.  I am opposed to this because my wedding is in less than three months and I would like to keep my nose on my face for that one day of my life.  I told them they can go ahead and operate on my nose as soon as I get home from London, with no bitching from me.  Until then...I suffer.  On the plus side, I lost eight pounds last week without even trying.

      I am not religious, but I am highly superstitious.  If you would, please go  urlLink here   and say a little prayer to St. Joseph, the patron saint of househunters, that I get the apartment I applied to.  See how desperate and unsure of my own credit I am?  Isn't that endearing?  See Joseph?  Free plug for you and your aspirin.  Help me out on this!

      Oh yes, I will have a  urlLink new entry   on Malarkey hopefully today or tomorrow.  Read it gosh darn it.  As a matter of fact, get on Malarkey and read everything I have ever written!  You want to see a picture of me?  Go to "Brooke and Neal's Top Tips for Successful Mattress Moving"  There are two pics of me on there and I look like crappety crap in both of them.  Also featured is my mammoth chest.  And my best pal Neal!  And a close-up of his ass!  Look at us!  LOOK!  I'm sorry, my lunch salad was orgasmically good and it made me a little hyper.  If you are unfamiliar with Malarkey, it is the site that I freelance for based at Rutgers University, the college that Patrick and I graduated from.  My site, Malarkey is featured on the left sidebar and you can check out all my archives for fun and no profit.

      I need to blog up some space here because adding Lynn's pictures to the site have pushed our archives way the hell down to the bottom of the page.    Them's the breaks.   When I asked Patrick to help me out by making his own posts so that we can push the pictures down and our archives back up, he answered with a typical snotty remark, EVEN THOUGH, last time I checked, he was a contributor on Raunchy Talk.  I would think that a true contributer, who cares about the site and the people who read it would be happy to help by punching out a few sentences for the purpose of altering the aesthetics of the site.  Not Patrick though.  He is more interested in chowing down on a fucking chicken basket to care where the hell our archives end up.  Maybe there are people who visit the site and did not scroll down far enough to notice that we even have archives.  There's funny stuff in there man!  Seriously, you are so selfish it makes me want to throw up on you.

      Lynn wrote to my mom with horrible and UNTRUE tales of my behavior:   Dear Mrs. Brooke's Mom,   I am writing to you because I thought I should inform you of your daughters bahavior in the work place.  Brooke is constantly burping and farting at me and Patrick!  She also pranks her clients and pretends to be YOU!  She says, hi this is Debbie from the animal place and I'VE GOT YOUR DOG. Then she hangs up.   I think a good talking to or scolding is in need.   This is not good Bride-to-be ettiquette!   Thank You   P.S.  She said that at her wedding she is going to wear RED SHOES!  Then my mom wrote her back...  Dear Supervisor Lynn:     Unfortunately, Brooke has always been a "problem child".  We did our best but there is one in every family.  I know that Patrick does his utmost to keep her under control, but it is a thankless job.   We did try drugs and shock therapy but to no avail.  Please bear with us, she does have her good days, poor thing.   If you feel strong disciplinary measures need to be taken, you have my permission.                                                                       D.   God, just heap on the abuse people!  This is my boss and my mom!  I really am going to start acting like that and then see how they like it.

      You know a lot of my friends tell me that they never get around to really reading my blog...I wonder how safe I would be if I decided to post embarrassing and crass things about them without their knowledge.  Would they read it then?  Hmmm....  My sister has told me that she is against PAJOAHS (People Against Jamie Oliver And His Sluts).  She said, and I quote, "he is incredible".  Jamie Oliver, if you are reading this, I interpret her comment as meaning that she wants some sweet lovin' from your oven.

      I am not going to blog about the first thing that popped into my head today which was a recipe that I invented entitled "Patrick's Pubic Hair Pancakes" because someone might read it while eating lunch.  Patrick doesn't love you all as much as I do.  He is too busy to post but for  his new  urlLink obsession   that is taking up all his time, energy and wrist stamina.  Here is a true story that will assure you all that Patrick and I are raunchy 24/7.  Yesterday afternoon we had a 15 minute conversation about ass-smelling (Patrick claims to have smelled a few while I have never had the pleasure).  He reported that everyone's ass has a similar scent.  Let's all give him a big round of applause for selflessly doing this important research and easing minds across the country.    If Patrick has sniffed your ass without your expressed consent please contact 1-800-PAT-NOSE to report him.

      This is the story of how I came to own the largest bra that I have ever had the pleasure of wearing during my entire bra wearing career.  I needed a support garment for under my wedding dress.  I was looking for a corset type of thing but when I got to Victoria's Secret and looked at the selection, I grew frightened.  It was suggested to me by my bevy of bridesmaids that I get someone to measure me.  I found a tape measure girl and she took me into the back and wrapped the tape around me.  Before she told me my size she gave me the ol' crusty eyeball and said, "What size do you usually wear?"  This is not a fair question.  Bras are schizophrenic, at least mine are.  I don't know that I have ever correctly nailed my own bra size.  That's why they have an assortment of hooks in the back, and if your boobs are coming out the bottom, oh well, just shift and jiggle.  I was vague.  "C or D..."  No mention of 30-something band length, that would just be suicide.  She looked at me in grave suspicion that she knew I had no idea of my real and actual bra size and said.  "Big C at the very least.  Go with D's."  Thus comforted she tossed me into a room and flung a handful of bras at me.  I was pleased when she told me that I would not need a corset because I did not need any 'cinching' and that would only make me uncomfortable.  Apparently I only needed major support for my monstrous mammaries.  I tried on a bunch and with each one the bra lady would come in and feel me up and ask if I thought it felt too big or too small.  I was wrong every time. Finally, after much poking and prodding we found the magic bra that would get me through My Big Day.  It was, without question, the largest bra I have ever seen in my entire life.  It was big enough to wear as a hat.  I came out when I was all finished, bra in hand and all bridesmaids stared in wonderment.  It was the most impressive bra that anyone present had ever had occasion to view.  We talked about the big bra all the way home.  It cost me $40.00 for proper wedding day support.    I swear, I will figure out how, and post a picture of it on the site as soon as I can.  You cannot live without having seen the big bra.  It should be the eighth wonder of the world.

      I sent my sister an e-mail and told her that since she is the Maid of Honor and her first fitting is in a few days that she needs to go and get a damn bra to wear with her dress.  The dresses are strapless and I was told specifically by the seamstress that no one get into one without a bra.  I wrote my sister a nice note explaining that and this is what I get back:  To the Bride:     I, your Maid of Honor refuse to wear such a restricting garment, know as a "bra". As a women of the "00's" (That's an awkward saying..) I am making a stand against this injustice against my body. I refuse to let my breasts not be seen.. and on some occasions heard. My boobs have spoken and they ask for freedom! I hope you take this letter as a very serious matter. Thank you for your time.                                                                 - Amanda (Maid of Honor)                                                                   CC: Her Breasts.

      Today at lunch, Lynn and I went to Harmons and bought Patrick a big box of condoms in a shape that I have never before encountered.  They look like the top of a soft-serve ice cream cone.  He gave me one and once we try them out we will give you results based on the following elements:  1. Comfort 2. Pleasure 3. Ease of application and removal 4. Level of humor achieved when blown up 5. Flexibility  The best part of this study is that we will be able to provide you with both the male and female viewpoint on the pros and cons of these condoms.  We here at Raunchy Talk would like our readers to avoid taking costly and potentially embarrassing condom risks, so for you, we will be the judge.

      It is really hard to watch an English movie with German sub-titles.  Even though you know that you can ignore them because the characters are speaking English, you can’t help but look at them anyway and when you do the characters don’t sound like they are speaking English anymore, but some bizarre hybrid language.  This observation has been brought to you by  urlLink Malarkey  .  Go there.  Read my columns!  This is what I have to offer!!!                                 ARCHIVES  1.

      Lynn made a fake newspaper article with my picture on it that says, "Brooke Threatens To Strike NJL" and there is a tiny picture of me embedded in a scene of a group of Palestinian protesters.  Patrick cracked up at this for 5 solid minutes.    It's even funnier than the picture of Patrick and the horse, but not quite as good as the one of him riding the cat.

      Um...I know that I've been out of the spotlight for a while now but once you understand why I had to get away. A couple weeks back, I had the chance to go shopping with Brooke for her new Wedding Bra. Well, you already know the story since I see she posted something regarding but she left out some keys elements to the story that need to be address.  I was with her when the bra fiasco occurred but just like a ominous haunted house, I entered the dressing room but never left. Well, not technically but emotionally I will always be in that god awful fitting room. Ok, so we were in the fitting room making sure her bra was fitting correctly when all of the sudden Brooke puts both hands on my waist, picks me up and places my whole body underneath her massive rack all the while muttering, "i need to have a larger rack for my wedding so you're going to help me out".  She then puts on the bra and then exits the facility with no regard to my breathing or well being or anything.  Everyone with us uttered...."where's did patrick go?" Brooke replies, oh Richie called, he needed Patrick to pick up some 'milk' so he had to go." Nothing more was spoken.  After being stuck under those gargatuan melons, I finally escaped in the early morning hours only to find that her window had been sealed shut with super adhesive. I took one of her dildos and smashed the window and leapt out onto the cold hard concrete. Now I am sitting here at work with a broken leg and a breathing disorder i can only attribute to Brooke.  I will never look at her the same again.   So now you know why i've been so elusive all these days.  Never trust any woman who wishes to have a bigger set of jugs. They will do anything and I mean anything to have their way.

      Because she is a mean mean girl, Lynn had to go and trump my brand new apartment news by bringing in her good news of this week:  She is the newest member...of the Dave Mirra Fan Club.  Congratulations Lynn and may your dues bring you a bountiful harvest.

      More on my capitivating real-life apartment hunt.  I now have...  *@*@*@*@*@*@TENTATIVE NEWS!!!*@*@*@*@*@*@  I called today.  I didn't want to, but I called and the lady, Gracie, said that she was still waiting to hear from the owner but she THINKS...that it will be fine.  GOODNIGHT GRACIE!!!!  Ok then, this blog entry is dedicated to Lynn, who just love love loves reading them and making comments.  For her, I want to write about...Well, let's ask her for a topic shall we?  B-Lynn!   L-What? B-What do you want me to blog about? L-I want you to blog about the Inferno/Dave Mirra.  I love him. B-That's what I thought you would say.  Ok, so yes!  Very very excellent Inferno last night!  Gripping!  Titilating!  Vomit!  For those who missed it, here is my recap.  We open as always with Scenes from Last Week, indicating that our Inferno nominees from the last mission are in fact Girly Boy Shane and Bi-Eyes David.  As last week David stirred up the rage inside of me, I am rooting for him to be shucked off on the tugboat to Purgatory.  Opening credits.  Dave Mirra check.  He looms over the camera...bald.  This week we have a daredevil mission...with a twist!  All competitors are to complete a 180 foot bungee jump while at the same time, playing Houdini and getting out of cheesy makeshift handcuffs and dropping a scarf from their pants.  Sound tough?  You have no idea!  Makeshift handcuff makers, hang your heads in shame.  These kids were ripping out of these things in seconds flat!  50 seconds!  32!  25! 19!  17!  WoW!  This mission seems to be in the bag for the Real World team who are bouncing their way to a victorious comeback.  Dave Mirra check:  He watches...bald.  Now we come to that most cherished part of any pseudo dangerous challenge... It's the Someone Gets Scared and Taken To the Hospital portion of our show.  This week it's Leah, who even before being strapped to her bungee is in convulsions on the floor, at the same time we have Katie, shivering on the platform for 12-odd minutes while on the ground Veronica screamed out at her my favorite line of the night, "I fucking hate you!"  Sadly, due to Leah's freak out, she gets DQ'd and beats Katie for the worst possible time for anyone to have, ever.  Dave Mirra SPOTLIGHT!  He delivers the grave news that Leah has tragically chickened out and cost her already pathetic team a sure victory.   This is grim news as is indicated by the Road-Rulers failure to cheer and go, 1-2-3 ROAD RULES!  In the Inferno...  It's time.  We enter the Pit of Hell itself and are horrified to discover...the table...laden with...MILK AND COOKIES OHNO!!!!!!!!!  What?  Are they serious?  I think they are.  Dave Mirra check:  He smirks...bald.  Object of the game!  Eat cookies!  Drink milk!  Spin round and round!  DON'T THROW UP.    Shane, get in there buckaroo.  Dave, get...but wait a minute!!!  CT, friend to all creatures with two different color eyes, has   sacrificed himself!   He saved his friend.  Everybody in unison now:  Awwwwww!!!  Ten minutes boys, eat your cookies, drink your milk.  Ok, ready?  Get on the spinny spinner and spin around.  Shane whoops it up and throws his arms up in glee.  CT wears shades and spins in calculated silence.  Round 2:  Eat em up eat em up, TWO cookies this time men, with TWO glasses of milk!  Did we mention that is whole milk?  You betcha!  Whole 100% milkfat milk!  Thick and gooey!  Yum yum.  Uh-oh!  Dave Mirra check:  He jumps back...bald.  SPLASH!  Old Shane has chucked his cookie, tsk tsk.  What will we do with you?  The Road Rulers hug him, much closer that I would want to hug someone with fresh retch still clinging to his oral cavities.  But they are a team!  Bring round the boat Mysterious Driver That We Never See.  Get on there Shane old boy.    As he rides away, in the distance, Dave Mirra sighs.  Bald.

      My nerves are getting to me....Let's have real life dialogue with Brooke and Patrick and I will write it as it is spoken.  Fun?  You betcha.  B-Patrick, my nerves are getting to me.  P-Okay  B-You want to say something to make me feel better?  P-Yes, what?  Oh!  Don't worry about it.  You should just call them.  B-I don't want to.  P-Sorry babe, gotta be patient or call them.  That's it.  There's Patrick of the poor advice.  I don't want to call them and seem like a pain in the ass.  They said that they would call me today and it's only...1:13 so I should wait a little more.  Right?  Ah shit.  I hate this.......................  CALLMECALLMECALLME(withgoodnews)CALLMECALLME....  "Call ME!  My laaaa...call me call me any any time. Call ME!  Da daaa when you something something share the wine call me.  Ooh ooh ooh."  I don't think those are the right words, but it sounds like that, you know?  Ah the heck with it.  Patrick just dropped in with a tip on my post.  He read my lyrics and then...  P-You shouldn't say that you don't think those are the right lyrics, say that you know that they are wrong, but you can't remember the real ones.  B-Why?    P-People will be like "Durf! She's stupid!"  B-That's why it's funny!  They know that I know that those aren't the right lyrics.  I obviously know that Blondie wasn't singing "something something"  P-Okay then...(with a disparaging look)  I think that bit got blown all out of proportion.  Moving on.  I had something funny that I was going to write and now I've forgotten.  A moment while I go and fetch a diet Pepsi and try to remember...  I can't remember.  This sucks big monkey balls.    How about a Horrible Story From My Childhood?  This is really bad and I think my mom should have been put on parental probation for a.) telling me this evil lie and b.) denying that she told me this evil lie, which I bet she will as soon as she reads this.  We have these trees around our house that grow and drop these little brown balls every spring.  I don't know what kind of trees they are, but the balls are about the size of a walnut and covered with little spikes.  If you step on the little balls, all this yellowish fuzzy stuff would come out.  One day I asked my mom what the little balls were and she said they were called monkey balls.  Then she said that I better not step on them anymore because every time I made the yellow fuzz come out I was KILLING THE BABY MONKEY INSIDE!  Isn't that horrible?  And it wasn't like I was ten or eleven when I asked her this, I was maybe five years old.  I swear, this disturbed me so badly that to this day I will not crunch one of those little spiky balls no matter how tempting they may be.    That's all I got people.   This random tyrade has been brought to you by Brooke's mangled nerves.  *Note from the Editor:  Not only did my mom not deny this story when she read it, but she still thinks it's funny!

      My  urlLink new entry   is definitely up and running, thank you Darrell!    Still no word on my apartment yet...grrr...I feel like I am waiting to find out if I passed pre-calculus all over again. (Please forgive my ramblings on past events that do not make sense without clarification.  I can't do clarification today, I am too jumpy)  Further bulletins as events warrant.

      We have a topic suggestion from Lynn:  Dear Brooke  I would like you to write a blog about the word slacks.  I just asked tony if he had a shirt to wear with his slacks and it cracked me up. I am laughing on the inside cause that word is hysterical.   Thank you, Lynn  Well, when I think of the word slacks my thoughts immediately go to two places: polyester and old ladies.  Old ladies wear slacks.  I think that they are the only people who, by law, are permitted to own these garments.  They may either be purchased, or sewn on a Singer with one of those patterns that come in a paper envelope with a drawing of a blonde girl on front.  They must be either pink or mint green.  Once initially worn, they must always emit a slightly rotten cheese aroma that can only be achieved by the meeting of polyester and old lady ass.  Those are the rules of slacks.

      I got a very exciting offer in the mail recently.  It seems that Time magazine would like to give me $192.20 off of their cover price for a full year subscription.  That's a savings of 86%.  Only thing that has me confused is that the letter is addressed to me and blazoned across the top are the words, "SENIOR CITIZEN RATE OFFER".    Should I take it?  I am only 25, unless my parents have been lying to me.

      Ok, to fully appreciate this story (translation:  I am just going to tell it, with no background information offered), you should really check out "Please Don't Be My Neighbor on  urlLink Malarkey  .  That being said, I got a call this morning from my sister Amanda who was in a full-blown blind rant.  She had a tale to tell.  Some important facts:  *We share a common fence with our evil neighbors Rhonda and Smitty. *They have three big junkyard dogs. Buka and the other two. *We are having new sidewalks poured in front of our house this week.   Apparently my sister was drawn outside in her pajamas this morning because there arose quite a ruckus.  She saw that the Rhonda and Smitty dogs had escaped from the yard and were running loose around the street.  Wishing to avoid potential hit and run fatalities, she ran out and attempted to herd them back into the yard.  The construction workers who were watching her do this apparently sussed it out that the dogs had come from our yard instead of the neighbors'.    Later...  Amanda was all set to leave for work when she heard the construction workers screaming bloody murder in the front yard.  She looked and yes, the Rhonda and Smitty dogs had broken free from their yard and were now running in the freshly poured cement.  Cement was everywhere and the construction workers were screaming at Amanda because they were still under the assumption that these were our dogs.  Out she went again, this time in work attire to try and round them up.  She managed to get two back in the yard but the third, a dalmatian, was giving her trouble.  He parked himself on the front lawn and lay there, lifeless, no matter how she tried to bully him in.  Eventually, she grabbed him by the butt and gave him a hard shove.  That's when he bit her.  Fueled by rage, she picked up the dog and tossed him into the yard, securing the gate with several large garbage cans strategically placed.  Then she called me to make sure I was home tonight when she plans to go over there where I am thinking it might come to fisticuffs.  Excitement?  Aplenty!

Yay Brandon!!!!   *Note from the Editor:  For those who wanted to know, Brandon was made Director of Enrichment through the YMCA, which means that he is in charge of all Child and Youth activities.  He can create and design any new programs, he has his own staff and he can hire or fire as he sees fit.  He has a degree in Art History and is an artist himself which gave him the edge.

       . Michael "boom boom" Aurora and Helena "Cannons" Poplar  Anyone with any information regarding the above mentioned please contact the authorities immediately.  They are armed and extremely dangerous!  These two were last seen running from The Tuscany Cafe (Edison, NJ).  Cannons was seen kicking one unidentified man (with nice eyes) in the head screaming "I want more Pesto mayonnaise" while Boom Boom held the invader 643 super soaker extreme action water gun and sang "I'm a private dancer".  There is a history of the two being involved in underground she-male pornographic films.

      Brandon and I brought our friends Jim and Jess over to our new place this weekend for some fun and frolic.  While they got the grand tour we experienced the following mis-adventures:  1.  Jim felt that it was important that he have the First Pee in our new potty and so we let him, only to discover, after the fact, that the toilet had been shut off, I guess to keep it from running while no one was living there.    2.  We noticed that we have a doorbell and so we sent Jim downstairs to ring it and he inadvertantly rang our neighbors bell instead, not just once, more like:  BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ  BZZ BZZ BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!  So now they probably hate us.    Presently in our apartment:  1 Toaster  1 Floor Lamp with extra lightbulbs  1 Can of paint for the kitchen and a stick to mix it with.  In the near future we hope to aquire additional items such as furniture.

      So...yea...I must admit that I sat down this Sunday Morning/Afternoon and watched a full hour of MTV's Inferno and I also must admit that I think I'm also smitten with the beauty that is Dave Mirra.  Now, I'm not one of those friends who thrives on stealing other friend's boy toys but if Dave Mirra ever approached me and asked me if I wanted to ride his "BMX" yea I think I would.  Sorry Lynn sometimes fate steps in the offers you the chance of a lifetime.  I'm perfectly willing to fight you on this?  You want to email him and ask him what he likes?  Beef or Fish?

      I got to thinking about what makes a TV show great and I think I have hit on the quintessential sitcom formula.  I call it, "Bosom Buddies meets the Golden Girls with a dash of Friends and a 'very special' Facts of Life".  What the hell? We'll make em' sing their own theme song!  Here it is: A young, mid-twenties kind of couple, has to pretend to be an elderly, mid-seventies kind of couple, so that they can live in a great apartment with cheap rent in a retirement community!  Think of the hijinks!  Don't look at me like that.

      Patrick was showing me some pictures today (at 9 a.m.) from a party at his house and to my sleepy eyes surprise there was one explicit shot of two naked pee-pees, one of whom, I personally know, but have no desire to see in the buff.  Is this something boys do?  I know that my female friends and I would never deliberately get naked from the waist down and have a photo shoot.  Why do boys need to get naked to be weird?  Because, it's not always pretty and if I'm being honest, it's downright ugly at 9 a.m.  If you are a boy, or have insight on how boys behave, please advise.

      It's now time for another edition of "Brooke Solves Your Freaky Problems".  Today's question comes from Neal:  Brooke,  i bought a bottle of coke, and each time i drink from it it smells  like  fart!  it doesn't taste like fart, and the bottle itself doesn't smell like  fart. but there's something somewhere near the opening that stinks!  but i  want the coke!  i don't know what to do!!!  egads!  -neal   Dear Neal,  In order to alleviate this problem please follow this patented procedure:  Using an X-acto knife and taking care not to slice off any major appendages, cut away the entire top of the bottle and remove, thus ridding the bottle of the offending farty area while not sacrificing any Coca-Cola liquid.  At this point, either pour remaining beverage into a cup or drink directly out of modified container and enjoy.  As a last step and final precaution, do not purchase Coca-Cola from that particular vendor again.  Thank you for being with us for this edition of "Brooke Solves Your Freaky Problems".  Join us next time when we look at a way to successfully dislodge a stubborn popcorn hull from an incisor.

      I was going to title this "Yawn", but I typoed the M and W and I dunno...I kind of liked it.  My new word.  Yamn.  Like damn, only fancier.  So I am tired today because yesterday I had to drive to AC at 5:30 in the morning.  (That's Atlantic City for people outside of the tri-state area.)    I wonder...do other states do the tri-state area thing or is it only NY/NJ/CT?  I mean most states touch at least two others, but you never hear about the Florida, Georgia, Mississippi tri-state area.  What about Pennsylvania?  Does it feel left out?  Can't it tri with Ohio and West Virginia?  So anyway, I was driving to AC for a conference and I left in the middle of the night and it took me hours but I made it for 8:00 a.m. which was my plan.   Once I got there I stood around as people tend to do at conferences and then there was a voice on the loudspeaker asking people to please continue standing for the National Anthem.  The anthem was being sung at this event by the Four Really Old Ladies In *Slacks Choir.  They were so bad that I thought the show was making a really off-color joke at the expense of our fine nation.  I did not make it through with a straight face so I just stared at my shoes with my chin pressed so close to my chest that my oxygen was cut off and I hadn't the air needed to emit laughter and shame myself.  So today, I continue to be tired even after a coma-like sleep when I returned from the conference (which was a fine event that featured a lot of standing around in uncomfortable shoes and a $7.00 cheeseburger).  Tomorrow, a new task is at hand.  I have been assigned to be a diversion for someone who I will not name while someone else prepares for something that is, as of now, an unplanned event for the person that I am supposed to be diverting and who I don't think reads this website, but you know, just in case he/she does in fact choose this day to read it I wanted to make sure this was plenty confusing.  Then again, if they do read it they will know that they are the person who is going somewhere with me and subsequently realize that the person who I will not name, has a name, and it is theirs.  As a precaution against this, let it be known that tomorrow, at some point, the whole day through, I have made plans with everyone that I have ever known, in my entire life.  Even if I haven't met you yet!  You and me.  We're hanging out.  * See below.

      As you all know, because I babble on incessently about it, I am on the verge of moving.  Which means we have been painting.  A lot.  Our entire apartment is swathed with dropcloths and cans of paint in various hues and it's a bitch because we keep running out of supplies and as a result I have become intimately involved with the floor help at Lowes.    So when my mother asked me to go to the huge Discount-O-Rama with her this weekend I agreed, in hopes that I would be able to purchase more painting supplies for cheap.  Good n' cheap.  I am going to open my own Discount-O-Rama called Good N' Cheap (with the 'N' turned backwards).    Anyway.  We set off on Sunday morning, my mother, sister, Brandon and I.  When we arrived we split up because my mom needed to buy some things for my brother, who has also recently moved into his new apartment.  Rest assured that there is no painting going on in his place.  The last time I visited him, his entire decor consisted of a couch, stocks and a tall X-shaped device that looks like a medival strecher with cuffs for hands and feet.  It is a veritable bondage room.  My brother is very strange and there we were buying him a coffeepot and toaster.  Brandon and I bought many supplies that would carry us through our time of painting.  We got rollers and edgers and brushes and pans, not to mention a whole mess of paper cups that say "Parrot Coffee" on them.  All for $25.00.  Pleased with our purchases, we wandered around a bit and eventually wound up in the party supplies aisle.  There we noticed that they had an array of wedding cake toppers, the most intriguing of which featured a gaunt looking groom with purple lips clutching the arm of the bride whose head was missing.  It was not pre-manufactured with a missing head, it appeared to have been broken off.  Still I thought it a strange choice for the store to put on display.  I wanted it.  Me:  Brandon, look at this!  Brandon: Perfect!  We'll get it for the wedding cake!  M:  I'm not kidding, I want it.  B:  What for?  M:  It's funny!  Don't you think it's funny?  B:  Sure.  Buy it then, it's .99 cents  M:  Why should I buy it, it's broken?  I am going to take it.  Now Brandon is familiar with my habit of taking odd things so he didn't argue.  I stuffed it into my purse which is huge, because I carry my life around with me.  You could drop me on a desert island with just my purse for survival and I would live for years.  We walked around a bit more and then I wanted to show my sister the party aisle because it was rich with humor and while we were there I opened up another cake topper box so I could show my sister what I had in my bag.  Much to my surprise and delight, this topper had a full bride, but the groom was missing his head!  PRICELESS!  I had to take that one too.  Carrying my huge purse full of stolen cake toppers and pushing the cart, we all went to checkout.  Next to our lane, of course, was a uniformed policeman on the lookout for degenerate people like me.  I had my wallet in my hand so I wouldn't have to open my bag in line and I waited nonchalantly for my turn.  I started to bag my stuff and so I handed my wallet to Brandon who..STARTED TO PUT IT BACK IN MY PURSE, OH NO!  M: BRANDON!  I need that!  B: What's the matter with you!   M:  My credit card is in there, don't put it away!  B:  We can use mine!  M:  NO!!!  GIVE IT TO ME!!!  So he handed it over and once we were safely outside, I gave him hell for being such a bad accomplice.    So now, I have two headless wedding cake toppers that I will never use that I stole from the Discount Warehouse.  That, my friends, is a memory that money just can't buy.

      So last weekend I was in charge of keeping Dickie, Patrick's fiance, busy for the afternoon so that his surprise party could be set up.  This was to be a four hour event, so as part of the afternoon's entertainment I decided that we would return my *Big Huge Bra back to the Lair of Nylon that bore it.  I picked him up in my car so that he would have no means to escape and we headed for the mall.  I was trying very hard to keep the conversation away from topics that may cause me to accidentally divulge the surprise party, so I went with something neutral.  B-You want to see something funny?  Look in the bag in the backseat. Have you ever seen such a huge bra?  He takes out the bra and examines it briefly.  D-That is big.  Is that a D?  B-Yup  D-Let me feel your boob.  B-No.  But thank you for asking first.  Now, mind you, I was driving when this happened.  He reaches over and grabs my right boob and begins to maul me.  B-Excuse me?    D- (Finishing whatever he hoped to gain from that) No.  You wouldn't fit in that bra.  B-How would you know that?!?!?  You are a GAY MAN!    D-You should have brought me with you to buy it, I would have told you.  Now wait, that's not even the best part!  The very BEST PART of all this was when we got to Victoria's Secret and I got my $40.00 credit.  I decided to buy my wedding day underwear with it, so I wandered around and had the audacity to ask him what he thought of this one pair.  He gave me the old crusty eyeball and then said, "You know, I really don't feel comfortable helping you pick out underwear."  Don't you just love that?  This from someone who I have known since I was 14 and who had just felt me up in the car.   *See below

      I have an extreme intense hatred for one actress and after hearing she was going to have a recurring role on my all time favorite tv show I almost flew to Cali and ordered Alan Ball to fire her.  Why does Mena Suvari have to be in the public eye?  She is skanky, horse faced, mother fucking piece of shit who should be shot in the legs everytime she steps onto any sound stage.  How anyone can work with that beast of a girl is beyond all comprehension. Look at her!!!!!!!  She makes babies cry. She makes dogs hide with their tail between their legs. She makes cats miss the litterbox every single time they take a dump. She makes Brooke bleed from every orifice.  Good God man someone stop her!!!!

      I had my bridal shower yesterday featuring a very exciting EMERGENCY!!!  First, I must explain about Brandon and his fear of fire.  Brandon is afraid of fire.  That clear?  Ok.  So we were rounding up the loot at the end of the shower and I noticed that the garbage bag o' gift wrap and tablecloths was smoking, due most likely to a castoff cigarette.  So I said, in a very calm and controlled kind of way, "Garbage is on fire." grabbed one end and started to drag it outside.  Brandon then rushed up to me with a full pitcher of...milk...and doused the entire bag, thus extinguishing flames that were not even born yet.  With milk.  Then, taking the bag outside, we created a huge milk snail trail thus contaminating the only exit path.  I think that this should be a new wedding tradition at showers all over the country.  After the gifts have been opened you have the ceremonial Garbage Torch and everyone throws milk on it.  For fertility.  Or something.

      I have something now that I have never had before.    A downstairs neighbor.  Living right under us.  His name is Bert.  I have never seen, heard or have otherwise had Bert's existance verified to me, but for the fact that his mail appears and disappears at regular intervals.  We know his name because we checked his mail out one day but Bert leads a quiet life.  His apartment is always dark, his door is always closed.  Because he is so completely absent he has grown to achieve extremely high status in our minds.  "Take your shoes off!  Bert might hear!"  "Turn the TV down!  Remember?  Bert!"  "Be careful!  You are always dropping things!  Bert is going to hate us!"  And last night...  "Do you think we ought to move the bed so that it's not pressed against the heating vent?"  "Weelll....ok, but quietly.  We don't want to wake Bert."  Bert is taking over our lives and we have never even seen him.  We don't speak too loudly, walk too heavily or otherwise perform any activity that may disturb our phantom neighbor.  You are getting that this is the first time we have lived in an apartment huh?  I have cleverly deduced, by the presence of     Maxim  in Bert's mail, that he might possibly be a young guy.  I hope so.  I have spotted several people in the complex that I hope are not Bert, and doubt are.    Bert...you intrigue me.  Please show yourself.  I can't hear, "Was that Bert banging on the ceiling?  Are we being too loud?" one more time.

      Hey Patrick remember when you found that big hair in your lunch?  That big long hair that you thought was a small hair till you pulled it and it turned out to be a long black hair in your food?  Remember that?  Makes you gag doesn't it?

      We think that Bert is dead in his apartment.  Last night Brandon noticed what he referred to as a 'sour' smell.  I didn't smell it then but this morning when I stepped into the hall I was smacked in the face by a stench so foul it can only mean that Bert has perished and is now rotting away into a hideous shrunken corpse.  I am reluctant to call anyone in on this because it might just be that Bert has poor garbage removal habits and maybe he made fish last week.  I think it would be a bad way to introduce myself if our first contact occurs because I sent the super over to make sure he isn't dead.  If he is in fact dead, I just hope that someone finds out before tomorrow, because Brandon is going away and I am going to be all alone this weekend.

      I hate that I have been such a bad blogger, but I have so much to do.  In the next five weeks I will finish planning my wedding, finish moving, have pre-wedding parties and rehearsals, get fitted, get groomed, pay out the ass for all the expenses, get my damn car fixed because that stupid bitch just  had  to smash into me at the worst possible time ever, make favors, buy presents, have bachelor(ette) parties, get licenced to be married, pick out the food, book the cars, book the bus, keep the bridesmaids from killing each other, get married and the next day leave for London.                   AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!   Did I mention that I read an article today that said not to plan a June wedding outside because cicadas are invading the East coast?  A flood of LOCUSTS will be mating all during the ceremony!  Which is OUTSIDE!  The reception?  In a huge tent!  OUTSIDE!  Fuck that shit, why didn't they tell me this LAST June when I booked the damn thing?  CICADAS????  Give me a break!

      Why do people think that it is okay to sit in a public bathroom stall and have a chat on the phone when there are other people in there trying to have a private bathroom experience?  I go into the bathroom this afternoon and there I am, trying to pee, but all I can concentrate on is the woman in the stall next to me yukking it up in Spanish!  Who thinks that this is acceptable behavior?  Does anyone want to be chatted to by someone on the shitter?  I hate people.

      Bert continues to mystify and fascinate all of us and upon Brandon's declaration that he 'thinks' that he might have seen him, I have to admit that I grew melancholy thinking that the era may be over.  I see now that my grief was a tad too hasty.    So Patrick asks Bert's last name.  I have seen it on his mail, I know that it contains a J and begins with an F so I gave it my best shot.  Little did I realize that I had stumbled onto the funniest word in the history of all humankind, likely the word that was the joke in the Monty Python sketch that made people keel over and die.  Me, I merely grew slightly ill from the word causing me to vomit into the trash.  Mostly water vomit, but there was a bit of bile in there too.    A dangerous word this is.  I shall keep it in my memory should I ever have occasion to unlease it and kill one of my enemies.

      So, Brandon calls up Brooke this morning exclaiming..."I THINK I JUST SAW BERT!!"  Brooke then in turn screams to us at the office, "BRANDON THINKS HE SAW BERT!"  Still, I have no idea what the big deal is with this ellusive creature named Bert.  I feel like I'm on a Sesame Street sketch show for adults.  Anyway, the day goes on and we continuosly laugh and cry about the Bert phenomenon.  I then think to myself, "What if I Google his name and see if we can find anything else about this freak of nature who does not believe in light or anything else for that matter...just his monthly copy of Maxim."  I ask Brooke, "What is Bert's last name?" Brooke then replies..."Um...it starts with an F and sounds Chinese....something Bert Fenshwauisre." After her beautiful interpretation of what a Chinese surname that starts with an F sounds like we both just busted out in enormous laughter making her bend over her trash can and spit out the water she had just taken into her mouth or at least I thought that's what she was doing.  No joke, she comes back up still laughing saying "I just yacked in my trashcan!!"  I then continued my uproarious laughter until I eventually had to leave the room in order to compose myself.  I guess you had to be there because that was hardest I've laughed in an extremely long time.  God bless Bert Fenshwauisre for supplying us with an endless supply of laughter. I so hope he never surfaces as a real person because if that ever happened all the fun would end in a heartbeat.

      Oh my God!  No wonder Lynn is always asking if she can come over and meet my dogs!  I have FOUR, imagine the damage she could inflict upon them!  Just last week we went to the Pathmark down the street and she bought a family sized jar of Peter Pan and then casually mentioned maybe coming over to my house so she could 'play' with my dogs.  She was getting a little flushed, but I thought, "Hey, it's a hot day."  If I had only known about the burning desire coursing through her loins!  Lynn, please.  It's us, you know that we understand your weird urges, but these are OUR dogs.  Do you think Buddy is ever going to lick Patrick again?  No, because he had to take him to have his tongue removed.  It's a harsh sentence but one that you inflict upon yourself when you stray into the wild and wicked world of beastiality.

      So, yesterday Lynn decides to come with me to go walk my dog. Very excited because my puppy loves the attention I give him and loves it even more when he gets the chance to meet new people.  With that said, something happened that really disturbed me and made me never want to have Lynn Marie over anymore.  Well, we get to my apartment where Buddy is waiting very impatiently for me to let him out of his training crate.  I let him out and he instantly goes right for me, trying to kiss me etc. Typical Doggie stuff.  Then he sees Lynn and goes buck wild.  After a few minutes walking him outside, I bring him inside, with Lynn following, to give him a lunch time treat for being so good outside and what not. I then have to go to the bathroom before we head back to work. I ask Lynn to watch him until i get out and she kindly obliges.  Of course she obliges because I come out of the bathroom and maybe she didn't hear me open the door because she didn't even move from her position. What i saw just makes want to throw just thinking about it.  Lynn is on the floor of my living room moaning away with my Buddy in between her legs. What is lying next to her is a half eaten jar of Peanut Butter.  I ran back inside until she finished and nothing was spoken of the rest of the day. She acted like nothing ever happened. Did she not know that she was caught?  Does she do this to all her friends' dogs and cats?

      You are doing a good job.  Ok, I am only going to tell you this once.    W-e-d-d-i-n-g not weedding.  Weed is something that you smoke, obviously too much of.  "In the same  vein ."  Not vain.  You see, 'vein' is defined as a manner or frame of mind while 'vain' is either a fruitless effort or a state of narcissism.  Please,  please  try harder.  Makes us look bad, you know?

      Apparently the poking out of the optical organ was not enough.  Well, right after I get back from the hospital. Brooke decides to go off on yet another weedding induced rampage and stabbed me in the ear with a steak knife that was actually dirty with cow lard and A-1 sauce.  Sure my ear was tasty as all hell but come on, now I can't hear out of my right ear. After another arduous three hours in surgery they attached a new ear on my right side. Just like the Virgin Mary pupil, my ear is also in the same vain but instead of hearing regular voices every day, in my right ear all I hear is the Hallellujah Chorus by Handel.  I feel so spiritual.  Brooke can keep on kicking me down but Jesus loves me and will not see me go down.

      I'm sorry, I had to do it.  You see, here I sit, trying very very hard to work on something that required the utmost concentration and all I hear is:  "Turning JA-PAN-NESE I think I'm turning JA-PAN-NESE I re-ally THINK SO!  BOOMBOOM BOOM!!!"  "YOOOOOUUU!  SMELL LIKE POOPY!!!!!!!!!!"  "WHERE'S MY POST???  IT DISAPPEARED!  BRO-OKE!  IT WAS SO GOOD!  WHERE IS IT???  DID YOU TAKE AWAY MY POSTING OPTION???  WAAAHHHH!"  "Feel my hair!  It's SOFT!"  So yeah, I stabbed him. Can you blame me????   FYI----Violent not violant.  Do not insult me with poor spelling skills.

      Am I really that annoying?  Apparently, to Brooke, I am because randomly she side-swiped me with a letter opener blinding me in my left eye.  After three hours in surgery, the ER doctor finally had to just give me a fake eye to replace the one that Brooke so cruely tore out with her office implement.  The new one is actually really pretty.  Instead of a pupil, they gave a wonderful stained glass eye with a picture of the Virgin Mary where the pupil should sit.  Now God shines in on me whenever I open my eyes.  My insides roar with God's love. Thank you Brooke for giving me this gift even though it was out of rage. God forgives you.

      Well, it was hard work but I managed to give myself a big honking disfigurement just in time for the wedding.  How did I do it?  Well, crossing the street of course.  God saw me down there and decided that I haven't suffered enough so he dropped a nice pothole right under my foot.  I fell full out on the asphalt and gouged two holes in my ankle and took about a foot of skin off of my shin.  Good times.

      Brandon and I have come up with a new idea for a television show based on the antics of our dead neighbor Bert.  It will be called GhostBert starring Brooke, Brandon and Bert's door.  GhostBert GhostBert!  GhostBERT!  GhostBert is never seen nor heard.  GhostBert is allergic to all artificial light so you will never see any lamps turned on in his apartment.  GhostBert is sensitive to the sun so his shades are always drawn.  GhostBert does not eat, bathe or go to the bathroom so you will never smell food, hear the drum of the shower or the whoosh of a toilet.  GhostBert will respond to mail, so leave some outside his door and he will take it in...when you are not looking.  GhostBert GhostBert!  GhostBERT!  The entire premise of the show will be centered around Bert's closed door and me and Brandon wandering around upstairs talking about him.  Occasionally we will hear his door open and then watch as we run like the wind to stick our heads outside and strain to see him.  Fear not!  We will never succeed.  The show will go on forever or at least as long as our lease is active.  GhostBert GhostBert!  GhostBERT!

      Your wish is my command.  Here ya go.  Something funny about Amanda:  Amanda has a birthmark on the back of her thigh that looks like a chocolate chip cookie.  Apropos of that, I always refer to it as her cookie.  One day Brandon and I were in my living room and Amanda was wearing really short shorts and running up the stairs.  I yelled, " I can see your cookie!"  and Brandon thought that I was talking about something far more vulgar and screamed in horror.  Something funny about Jin Hee:  Jin Hee is the brownie girl at my wedding and is in charge of handing out the favors which also include fortune cookies.  She is Korean and so in keeping with political correctness she has decided to dress up in full Chinese garb and speak with a false Chinese accent for the night.  Please stay tuned for more fun facts about Amanda and Jin Hee!!!!

      Brandon and I have been living in sin now for the past month or so and I think we are doing pretty good.  We are, however, touching on conversational topics that we have never before encountered in our relationship.  An example:  (Yesterday...I am sitting on the edge of the bathtub, scrubbing it with Ajax brand cleansing powder)  Pause...  Me:  It smells like armpits in here.  Bran: (From the hall)  What?  M: Armpits.  It smells like armpits in this room.  B:  Well, it's not  my  armpits!  M:  I didn't say it was!  I said, something in this room, smells like armpits.  B:  Maybe it's  your  armpits!  M:  It is not!  It's  no one's  armpits!  I just said that something that is presently in this room smells like armpits.  B:  Well you are the only thing in that room that has armpits!  M:  If it was me I would smell it in every room, not just this one!  It is not me!  Smell me!  B:  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  This is why Bert doesn't want to hang with us.  These are the conversations that he hears.  Daily.

      Yes, here I am, in London, waiting to go to lunch BUT taking time out to blog and say that London is incredible and we love it and we might have to stay because the flight over was so turbulent that Brandon said he is not flying back.

      Last night Richie and I decided to take a stroll around my old neighborhood to see old friends with whom I have not had the pleasure of hanging out with in an extremely long time.  As most of you know Newark, New Jersey is not the kind of place for a couple of faggots but it's my home town and I needed to see my peeps one last time, plus I needed a little R&R from the hustle and bustle of Highland Park.  bad mistake to take this respite on a thursday night, fully aware that I had to work the next day, because I knew that once I entered the Newark city limits I would instantly feel the need to smoke the crack just like old times.  Richie never knew me when i was high on everything I could get my hands on.  He never knew the pain I had to go through turning my tricks because I knew Jose got in a primo stash of chronic the night before.  Anyway, no sooner did we enter Jesus' apartment did I find myself passed out on the corner next to a dead rat.  My ass bleeding from god knows how many guys gangbanging me the night before. I was late for work and my ass was bloody.  Next time I have the urge to purge on Newark city crack, I will remember that you can only ask to go home and change your pants so many times before it starts to look funny.

      I understand your greivance Helen and I am sorry you feel that I should be replaced.  In my defense, the reason why I do not write any blogs whilst Brooke is away is basically I cannot feel creative without my female counterpart here by my side.  Brooke is my fuel and has been since the day we met.  You want me to be creative Helen?  For you and the ten others who read this I will try my hardest to contribute my thoughts and random musings more often.  In the meantime, I will leave my readers with one simple question, and please answer honestly...Do you think Old Ladies masturbate?   I don't mean Golden Girls old, I mean Driving Miss Daisy old.  You think they pet the kitty once in a while?  Please send your responses to mandee9983@aol.com

      We have a new fan!  We love new fans!  Here is a letter that appeared in my e-mail this morning:  Letter to the Editor,   I am a fervent fan and reader of Raunchy Talk.  I look forward to all of your new posts and I always go back and reread the older ones.  I do have a grievence.  How come Patrick can never be creative and start his own Blog?  How come he doesn't write any when you are not around.  When you were on your honeymoon no blogs were written, just the one you wrote from London.   I think you should rename your blog - Raunchy Talk with Brooke and sometimes with Patrick.  if you need a replacement I will be happy to fill in.   Thank you.   Signed,   Helen Marks  What do we think people?  Raunchy Talk with Brooke and Helen?  Raunchy Talk with Brooke, Helen and Sometimes Patrick?  Raunchy Talk with Brooke and Her Disciples?  I am open for suggestions here!  I am in the works for a feature length Burt story created for Malarkey, so I will tell you when that goes up.

      This is the sad truth, poor lil Buddy has succumbed to a horrible case of the clap and it is all Patrick's fault.  Taking that defenseless animal to the dog park and parading him around in front of the bassets and of course the pugs who are by far the worst of that lot!  Now poor buddy has a swollen and inflamed little pecker and pees streams of blood tinged urine, crying all the time.  Patrick you are a cruel pet owner and you should be castrated by garrotting with a flaming choke chain!  Just because you have the clap doesn't mean you had to go and give it to your dog!  You sicken me and everyone around you.

      Nothing pleases me more than the thought of laying my gentle hands on Lynn's delicate kitty.  The soft cooes that emit from her tender lips. The delicate hairs that stand on end in excitement and anticipation.  Her tail glides up in a straight line forcing her bottom to raise in agreement with my hands wanting more.  Where's Brooke to enjoy this display?

      I hope everyone thinks to scroll.  So yes, that is a picture from my wedding of me and my husband Brandon.  We had the most gorgeous weather that anyone has ever had for a wedding, it was about 73 degrees, PERFECT, no humidity, no clouds just beautiful.  I have to tell you, probably my favorite event of the evening was the garter toss which featured Patrick, jumping up and down like a man possessed, yelling his head off and then diving horizontally, knocking over Neal, the best man, before catching the garter.  After they did the whole garter fanfare he came over and whimpered, "Guys, I think I broke my ankle."  He was out of commission for the rest of the night.

      I swore I was going to blog about this.  Went to the movies last weekend with Brandon and our sisters.  We were going to see  Saved  which was not playing anywhere near us so we had to drive out to East Bumble to a dilapidated theatre we never go to.  On the way in we passed a poster for  The Terminal .  Amanda:  That looks sad.  Me:  Sad?  What do you mean?  It's not a sad movie.  A:  Yes it is!  It looks so depressing.  M:  Why?  A:  Because he's  retarded!   M:  What???  He's not retarded, he's foreign!  A:  No he's not, he's a retarded guy!  Why else is he living at the airport?  B:  He's not retarded!  I swear, he's just got an accent.  A:  Are you sure?  Are you sure he's not retarded?  This went on all night.  Amanda insisted that the movie was about a retarded guy who lived in the airport because he didn't know any better.  This declaration possessed a high level of hilarity that everyone enjoyed very much.  Driving home...hours later...  Are you  sure  he's just foreign?  Two days later...  I think you are wrong Brooke...he's definitely retarded.  I told her that it is against the law for the same actor to play a retarded character in two different, unrelated films and she grudgingly agreed to drop it.  But she still thinks he's retarded.

      If you do she might turn around and decapitate your head with her thumb nail.  That's right, it's that time of year again.  Time for the annual Sunburn contest where everyone competes for the most earth shatteringly painful sunburn of the summer.  Unlike the people south of the 30 degree latitude line, we Northeasterners, if caucasian, are pretty much fair skinned creatures.  Our alabaster asses don't get to see the sun for a good chunk of the year so the summer months are filled with this complete false hope that we will somehow tan this year and just plain stupidity.  I won the prize two years in a row and I will probably pay for it in a couple of years when I finally decide to take a trip to the dermatologist. This year I may have some competition from Mrs. Brooke Powell herself.  Yes, she came into work this morning looking like a mixture of some happiness because she got some needed color, and some major anxiety because we all know what a really really bad sunburn can feel like.  Why do we go through this agony every summer? Why do we keep subjecting ourselves to the suns deadly rays of illumination. The best though is the half happy half painful smile we always seem to put on our burnt faces everytime we exchange dialogue with one of our peers.  Everyone looks at you as though you have this huge gash on your body that you received in some knife-fight in Tiajuana and you just stand and say..."oh, it's ok, the pain isn't so bad if I don't move. At least I got some color."

      I have not been very interesting lately which is why I haven't been writing.  Hopefully I will soon have honeymoon pics to post, including a very flattering shot of me posing with a dung beetle sculpture.  Here are some people I need to talk about:  Amanda: Happy 21st birthday to my sister!  Twat!  Helen Marks:  Lay off of Paddy-cake, he is getting riled and ready for your next comment.  I know him and he might be a tiny little man but anger gives him the strength of a dozen toothless cougars.  The least you could do is titilate us with some Gardening Tips before our rows grow brown and our leaves mottled.  Bert:  Bert has done nothing but haunt my dreams for the past few weeks.  Who are you???  Why do you taunt me?  Wherefore art thou?  The other day the fire alarm went off in Bert's apartment, scaring the bejeezus out of me because I was half napping at the time and I had visions of being forced out but for the flames and standing barefoot and shivering at the curb while my home was very nearly but not quite engulfed only to find later the Bert had snuck behind me, unseen, and covered my near frozen body with an old army blanket, saving me from certain death.  No?  Ok...  Come on, doesn't anyone remember high school English?

      helen m said...  I appreciate your efforts but I think they will be short lived. I have decided to start a blog of my own (nothing like yours, I have different interests) and I will comment with a link as soon as I have begun.  12:48 PM    If you readers may know, Helen M. is the person who bascially said, not in so many words, that I sucked. Her exact words in a polite manner..."How come Patrick can never be creative and start his own Blog? How come he doesn't write any when you are not around."   You've started a blog of your own huh?  Well, how come you haven't been creative enough to write a single post?  Please don't criticize when you are suffering from the same supposed uncreativity. Check Yo-self Befo You Wreck Yo-self.    Sincerely, P Fly.

      Lynn loves surveys.  We get a new one from her on a pretty regular weekly basis.  They are generally all questions of the same vein, maybe with a few different zingers thrown in.  She sends her answers to Patrick and I and we, in turn, reply with our own.  This week we had a question asking,   "Who is your funniest friend?"  To which Patrick answered, "Brandon"  Now, how can he honestly make that kind of statement.  I mean, yeah, Brandon is funny in a very dry and sarcastic kind of way, which I like.  I married him after all.  But in totality I have to claim myself as being funnier.  Allow me to present the following example:  Last night, Brandon was trying to go to sleep, but I was very very punchy and I guess I was being obnoxious, in that I kept yelling, "I'm gonna kick you in the  nuts !!! and raising my foot over his general groin area, pantomiming violent kicking gestures.  So this went on and he called me a baby and so I, in turn, called him a cockknocker, which caused him to get very upset with me.  In his words, "You are a nice girl, don't say things like that!!!"  So I started to sing, a little ditty of my own creation, made up at that moment.  You have to sing it to the tune of that song, "I'm a girl watcher" or, if it helps, the Wheel of Fortune commercial, "I'm a Wheel watcher".  Got it?  Ok.     I'm a cockknocker!  I'm a cockknocker!  Knocking cock and thigh!  My my my!!!   Repeat one million times.  I was raunchy AND funny.  That's talent right there, man.

      I found out the weirdest thing yesterday, my sister called me up with breaking news about the salon that we go to.  It is run by a pair of sisters and another chick who does the hair washing and the sweeping up and color mixing, what have you.  Always thought that she was a little off, she never spoke, I presumed this was because the salon is Portugese and she didn't speak English.  She dressed in very tight, tiny clothes and was very thin.  When she washed my hair there she had this freaky technique of putting her fingers into my ears (through the towel) and rubbing vigorously, which I was a bit unnerved by the first time.  So we have all that and then yesterday my sister called me with the news that our hair washer...  Is a man.  Huh.  What do you do with news like that?  I honestly don't know.

      Blogger  hated me yesterday and wouldn't let me post, so this news is a day old.    I came home on Tuesday evening and as I always do, I passed by Bert's door to check out his mail.  I never touch it or anything, just a general sweeping glance to see what old Bert is interested in this week.  What I saw surprised me.   Highlights  magazine.  I don't think I have ever seen a copy of  Highlights  outside of a doctor's office, so to see it on the front step of my mysterious reclusive neighbor was surprising to say the least.  I told Brandon about it that evening and we thought of potential theories that might explain such a sighting.  While contemplating Bert's magazine selection we heard a very loud noise that most definitely came from his apartment.  It was a chainsaw.    I jumped three feet in the air and Brandon turned white.  "Get up!  Into the kitchen!"  We stood and scurried into the kitchen and in a minute the noise stopped.    Bert knows that he fascinates me...and he is toying with us now.

      Patrick is singing...let's listen:   Who's that guy???  Where did he come from?  Who's that guy???  Where can I get one?  WHOA-OA-OA, who's that guy???"   I like it when Patrick gets into what I like to call Passionate Singing Mode.  This can manifest itself in a variety of different ways, including:  Real songs Real songs featuring the word 'you' substituted with the word 'Jew' Made up songs about mundane activities Made up songs about mundane activities featuring the word 'poop'  The best part about these moments is the intense and heartfelt concentration that you get by merely hearing Patrick belt out a tune in his cubicle.  Just to hear the melodic sounds of  Yooouuu smell like poooopy"  is enough to drive me to tears.

      God, alliteration is the greatest gift any literary genius could come up with.&nbsp; Anyway, thats not the point of this little rant but I just felt obliged to gush over my subject regarding a certain someone's boobies.&nbsp; We have this coworker who needs major help in the fashion department.&nbsp; She's a sweet girl but god help her please.&nbsp; At first glance she radiates this professional glow who sits at the front desk forwarding calls away to different departments, holding down the proverbial "fort" of our well oiled machine we call a weekly newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the facade falls and she actually take a serious look at her, she just screams fashion victim from early 1978.&nbsp; I know that the 70's and 80's have come back in a fierce way but it just seems like she actually saved her mother's clothing from that era not realizing that the style has come back but not the "hand-me-down" look.&nbsp; The first day she had on this uncomfortable powder blue (powder blue should only be saved for old grandmas named Estelle or babies named Stevie) muslin type pant suit.&nbsp; The look was fine but jesus christ it looked like it was about to chafe me just looking at it.&nbsp; The very next day I came into work hoping that she would come in with a little more fashion sense than the last day but sure enough I was wrong.&nbsp; I am not quite sure what exactly she had on but it screamed "BEIGE"!!!!&nbsp; The one thing I did notice though was that her breasts we extremely oddly shaped.&nbsp; They kind of looked like they were two number 2 pencils hanging out loosely from her chest.&nbsp; It didn't look like she was wearing a bra either which also kind of freaked me out me being gay and all.&nbsp; If we have to wear underwear to conceal our rockets then women must always wear, when neccessary of course, a bra that keeps everything from moving around in an obscene manner.&nbsp; That day wasn't the worst of it.&nbsp; Today I went to lunch at about12:00 Noon and came back after seeing my wonderful puppy for his afternoon walk and almost busted out laughing upon entering.&nbsp; I walk in the office and she is hunched over the desk writing something inconsequential down on some random post-it that our super company supplied her with and she is wearing an outfit similar to that one seen on Friday but instead of coy belt holding her pants at her waist she has this monstrosity of an accessory I can only think is a belt or at least I think it should serve as a belt.&nbsp; I walk in to my department and immediately bust out laughing to my co-workers who are also pondering the same question as I.&nbsp; Why the hell did she leave the house looking like that?&nbsp; Belts are one thing but do you really need to look like your leading a desert excursion with the color choice?&nbsp; She looks like she's a reject from Ishtar! Alright thats it. I'm done ranting plus Brooke is exclaiming across the cubicle, "Are you writing a book?"&nbsp; Fuck off diva.

      I know I have spoken at great length about Bert and his antics, but I haven't brought up the other weird thing about our apartment.    A few months back, I was drying off from the shower and something shiny in the toilet caught my eye.  It was a small piece of an earring shaped like a rounded pyramid with a small diamond in the center.  As I felt it was no time to be squeamish, I reached into the chilly depths and pulled it out.  Brandon and I could not determine if it was a real diamond and frankly I feel funny about asking an jeweler to check out something I got out of the toilet.  So as of right now it is sitting on our bathroom shelf for a rainy day.  Then there were the little metal rings.  On a day to day basis we were noticing small silver and bronze rings in the bottom of the toilet.  They looked about the size of a capital O.  Ex.  O  In either silver or bronze.  We have opted to leave them in the toilet, they appear to be happy and pose no danger.  Last night I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth and there, laying in the bottom of the bowl, was a slightly tarnished penny.  This being the first currency that has been bestowed upon us, we were justifiably very excited although we decided that we didn't need to pull it out.  We live on the second floor.  Is this a cosmic message from beyond?  Is Bert communicating the only way he knows how?  I suppose we will never know, unless a wayward turd wanders up and we send out for DNA testing.
