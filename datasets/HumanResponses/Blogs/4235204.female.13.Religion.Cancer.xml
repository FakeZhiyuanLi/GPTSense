       The first day of school is only three(almost 2) days away, and I am so nervous. (I told you I'd mention it again,) but the thing is... I have the 2 perfect solutions. My first solution is a dead giveaway. Can you guess who is going to help me through this school year? God. And even though I can't see him while I'm in the bathroom stall, crying, he's right there beside me, holding me tight. God will always be there for me this year, and ever year to come. Because I keep my relationship with him "up to date", God will always know what's happening. He may not "actually" speak to me, but when your relationship with God reaches a certain point, you find yourself finding signs from God. Enough on that. I also have a human helper. My stupendous acountability partner, Renee. She and I knew eachother for aobut 3 years now, but it's funny how we just found out how much we needed eachother like a month ago. Last year we struggled, and stumbled in our walk with Christ, but when we found eachother this year, we knew we had someone to actually "lean" on. We've come up with a plan to have a bible study at least once  a week before school, and if either one of us needs eachother, we're only a few lockers away. If your struggling, and can't seem to find out what to do... maybe you need to enrich your relationship with God. And once that is covered, I mean... you really have to know God, like a brother, then you can move on and find yourself an acountability partner. There pretty hard to find, if your serious. Your looking for someone that you love, get along with, and someone that you can easily talk to. I hope this little bit helped, thank you's to my best friend God, and my awesome acountability partner, Renee.

       When "everyone else" is in a relationship, it's easy to feel left out. That's normal. God created us as relational things. We want to belong. We want to give. We need to be needed. But before God candevelop these areas in us-helping us to connect with another person-He first wants to make sure our connection with Him is able to survive without other relationships. Yeah, it's easy to read about giving God control of our dating life, our future relationships, and even someday-to-be-met mate. It's another thing to actually DO it. Hey, if you haven't truly placed God in control of your past, present, and future relationships, RIGHT NOW is the perfect time to do it. Go ahead. No one's watching. Just say a quiet little prayer  right now and tell Him He's in charge.

       "The greatest single cause of atheism in the world todayIs Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."

       I'll say it now, and I'm sure I'll mention it again, I am a nervous wreck. I always worry about something/someone. Today is the day to worry about school, I've been worrying about it a lot lately, mostly because I want this year to be different. I know, a lot of us say that every year, and every year is the same. But this year I am making a huge effort to make things different. I go to this christian camp, and every year I learn something new. This year I learned that even if your left with no friends, God's path is the right one to be on. Last year I struggled during my walk with Christ because I wasn't hanging out with the right group of people. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a good, strong, commited, christian nowadays. But I put my faith in Christ and left the only people that accepted me, the popular, smokeing, drinking crowd. I'm not saying that I didn't want to leave them, I'm just saying that I didn't want to not have friends. I know that this is taking forever to explain, but bear with me here. I lived through the last half of the year with almost no friends, and trust me, that's not fun. If God puts me through another hard time this year, I will make it. Take your time in finding good, strong, christian, friend. Because hanging out with people that aren't "the right choices" is not worth it. If you find yourself friendless and all alone in your walk with christ, remember this... "Don't worry about anything, instead pray about everyting. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all that he has done". Phillipeans 4:6
