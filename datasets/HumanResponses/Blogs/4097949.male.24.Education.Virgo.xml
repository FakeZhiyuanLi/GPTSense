      It seems the important things in life become the most trivial when you put on a cynic's cap. Yet, sometimes all it takes is a song to remind you why we love certain dreams of our own. Its a change of clothes to alter the mood entirely. You put them on to feel new again despite the number of times you have heard the song before....  Rob Fleming vs. Rob Gordon is just how i feel right about now. My eyes look lackadaisical and drained. I wonder if this is how John Lennon felt during the infamous Lost Weekend. This is my unproductive era even though the money is good. Jobs in Japan clash with Seattle sounds. Though i shouldn't complain. I am better off than most teachers i know in Korea, yet i feel a bit knackered in a rather obtuse way. This fatigue extends to making plans within a year's time for God knows what.  i try not to think about it too much right now. it will be awhile until i start i singing, "i have to admit its getting better...." Seems as i have been chasing that dragon of a moment ever since high school.  Good Morning, Good Morning.  i stayed up all night listening to Neil Young and The Beatles remembering how it feels to smile without looking in a mirror. I haven't done that in a while. Listening to particular music right there and then simply.... because i felt like it. This custom of mine is always spontaneous as well, just how it should be. i took advantage of that rare time because these ears have not seen many moments like these to celebrate. It would've been better if i've had some wine in the house to drink in tandem to the music. Red merlot would have been right on the mark. Something right out of a Nick Hornby novel.  A Day in the Life.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo. I found something in these songs i had forgotten long ago. If all you need is love why isn't it so hard to remember? Love doesn't pay the bills the cynics whine. Well, that's not the kind of love they were singing about, it alludes to something else altogether.  If you had to emulate something about kindness and cruelty which one would you rather prefer? Of course being an asshole is an universal concept regardless of race, breeding, and nationality. Then again, I don't want to be like everyone else. All i need is love though it might be different from yours. The Beatles mean different things to the same people. Fatherhood, for example. John Lennon was supposed to be a real asshole to his son Julian, yet the man wrote some of the most touching songs ever.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  If i ever became a father i would prefer a daughter. I always read about how historically male heirs were so important to so-and-so's bloodline and family name in chronicled texts. Machismo makes me sick to my stomach, so if i had to make my own history i would let it be remembered for something else than a mere name.  Lovely Rita Meter Maid.  I am not certain about fatherhood someday but i feel i wouldn't do such a bad job before they hit puberty. My own parents were just not key in this stage of life. Even more so in my sister's case. Of course, I would make mistakes as any caring parent will most certainly do. Love is all you need. All you need is love. Enough love to go around to compensate for the lack of funds and finances. Love of wanting to spend time with your kids no matter how difficult their personalities or how impossible your personal life is. Love of liberal ideas and values letting your children learn about life without suffocating them with draconian measures, child abuse need not apply.  Love of music.  I would imbue a sense of good taste in music to my offspring. For obvious reasons, this is vastly important to me. It would give the kids and i something to bond over and share no matter the years that separate us. By then, i will hope to have accquired a larger record collection than my present one at the moment and i would leave all my vinyl to them. Taking my kids to see live music would become a necessary staple of family life. It would be musicians of merit with some actual integrity.  With a Little Help from My Friends.  i wonder if these possible future extensions of me will be some of the loveliest people you could ever meet. A little love and affection goes a long way in this world of cynics and racists. After that, you would have to cross that line of being a parent to being on equal terms with your adult children. Sort of like friends if they can tolerate you by that point. Swigging pints of beer and laughing about something or another. Growing older, i would call these future periods my Wonder Years with Ringo singing in the background. Not Joe Cocker.  When I'm Sixty-Four.  I am turning older next month. 25 years old, my silver anniversary. Is it so strange to dream of a future fatherhood? Preferably with some wonderful woman somewhere down the road of time. Exactly what do other men my age dream about? When i was younger i wanted different things, at least i knew that. Time changes minds as often as we quote ourselves quoting others. John Lennon once said life is what happens to you when you are busy making plans. Lots of people don't know what they want in life. I should be so fortunate i know at least one thing i want to do.  Getting Better.  i would like to father a daughter someday. Maybe even buy her a guitar should she ever consent to learning how to play. My family was never a musical one. I never quite understood why my brother Lali hated The Beatles. He just never gave me a convincing argument to specify why. I just simply assumed he would appreciate this particular group. I have no idea what he is going to let his kids listen to. He is on his 3rd son at the present moment yet to beget a daughter. I think the extended family could benefit from having a niece in their midst. They will, no doubt, need some sort of music refinement. I guess i will have to be a clever uncle in the absence of a cooler older brother or sister in the vein of "Almost Famous". I'd sneak those nephews essential pop records such as The Who's "Tommy", The Beach Boys "Pet Sounds", Pearl Jam "No Code" and The Shins "Chutes too Narrow".  Maybe Lali would come around years later to the idea of loving The Beatles if i made him a proper mixtape. He needs to think about music other than what he listens to on his car stereo. Otherwise i'll be the guy taking his kids to concerts, if i never have any of my own, singing along with the band.     "....and i'll try not to sing out of key." - JL

      Questions and answers.  David Lynch films and Daniel Quinn books.  Call me Ishmael and what we have been wondering all along comes outloud in words and thoughts, not dreams. I dream to forget 1993-1998. That era should be stricken from the record. My family life was brutal and dishonest. I was so painfully uncool and listened to tasteless music. Unforgettable. Nat King Cole i was not.  Enough about regret.  There is still time to make new memories however unpleasant the present climate. I dream of music and indie record labels and writing. It never seemed so far away. I even wanted to be a cinematographer at one point. Yet, i seem to have a phobia about photography. The same goes for painting. I secretly despise those who waste their talent on self-absorption.  If i could have my own creation myth it would be that i could do something of substance. Does that constitute being a teacher? With a slightly used history degree? i remain faithfull i will find out just exactly what am i good at even though I am almost 25. Although, the worst is when other people pull you down. Whether former supposed comrades question your character and you decide the best answer is no answer....then perhaps you have entered a new realm of maturity. John Cusack would be proud.  Fuck their altering opinions.  i am an altered beast beyond their perceptions of a brown-skinned 18-34 male. They do not represent me nor did i vote for them to be my peers. Where do these naysayers come from? They tend to have the annoying success and irony of meaningful jobs or being in love before you.  Love your enemies.  Why is it when loved ones get married you are actually happy for them.....but what happens when other individuals that come and go in your life exchange their vows?  Your indifference threatens to gets the better of you. You resort to petty grievances and bitterness creeps in questioning why should they have a succesful relationship? Cynicism reminds me of the divorce rate, much more is the soothing prospect of not having to attending a boring wedding.  The latter statement makes me break out in smile.  Now Jamie's wedding was a lot of fun. That's what i call a wedding. I would have him DJ it anytime.  Still.  Love seems ever elusive to me. Catch me if you can little brown-skinned gingerbread man. I sing my songs at the volume of High Fidelity because i am the last of the hopeless romantics.  Speaking of which, i was quite unhappy to miss Kristen's wedding. I thought it would be honorable to support a good friend on an important day. Alas, I could not make it and regret not being there. The way Rachel described it in an email provoked sincere emotion from even me. Being stuck in South Korea starts to suck when you miss crucial weddings not to mention a brand-new shiny Pearl Jam tour for a good cause.  Bush must not win. Repeat, recycle, rinse out the truth. Question this man's authority not the one on a bumper sticker.  Time is running out on the 25th hour. If i want to start a record label or become a writer of merit, i'd better hurry up and pull a Rob Gordon. Can't say the same the for love. It has a time of its own. Still looking for a girl who knows how to lace her Doc Martens and has a decent vinyl collection.     Better put it on a wishlist as a man of supposed faith.

      it was the year our heavens burned.  Modern myths in my daydreams about how i would like life to be. Need versus desire for how to spend my finances in fear or live beyond my means.  i am approaching my 2nd month in South Korea and too many things have coincided with my decision to move here.  things such as empathy.  Laura feels alone and frustrated just i like i did when i was her age. Except she is in Bogota and i was not. Different mothers same fathers the difference is that we are the same in so many ways unlike my other siblings. To be a young woman her age feeling like she has grown older before her years saddens me. Was it mere money or soemthing else that kept me apart from her all this time?  i shed hidden tears and hidden truths for my sister....  ********************************************  The constant fatigue of keeping in contact with other people devours me whole. Sending an email or composing a letter shouldn't be manual labor, yet it feels like it sometimes. Why is that? Somehow i am left feeling drained with a residue of futility. It is a doubting spirit, one that threatens my ability to keep close friends much less loved ones.  The anxiety of wanderlust coupled with co-worker relations allows me to make new companions.   ....but just who are these people?  We are thrown together as some sort of motley crew etching a living while finishing our teaching contracts. Why are some of us even here in Asia? Motives aside there are some really lovely human beings here. We share drinks and anecdotes but i rarely connect with some of them as i am living in some sort of spiritual vacuum.  People come and go in this job as the seasons change and the leaves turn, yet i do not feel my part of the pattern.  Heather and Paul left for Japan yesterday, I helped them with their luggage to get it in those bastard taxis. Aaron is also leaving Tuesday, but to wander in Southeast Asia. I am envious yet, glad to be grounded for a while to save money.  Sometimes i wonder if i will ever see them again.....

      I do believe i have found the coolest little bar in Incheon.    Its called "Muse" and the owner has a literal wall of vinyl records.   Looking at it is just breathtaking.  Finally another collector in this Godforsaken town! I went there tonight and got some whiskey.  Talked to the owner baout Leonard Cohen then drummed my fingers to some Hendrix.  I asked for some coconut rum and Coca-Cola.  The peopl ewho run th eplac eare some rather nice folks.  I am amazed that a bar in Korea has chairs with the words "B.B. King" and "Neil Young" stenciled on them near the bartender.  So i finally wired money for the deposit on my trip for a holiday in Beijing.  It feels good to be go somewhere other Seoul.  i really miss China.   i long to go star-gazing again....  where's my whiskey?

      Wow.  Lowlight told me online today that Pearl Jam is playing the swing states this October to influence voters not to vote for Bush.  I am stuck in South Korea so unless I can get some time off work the rest is history!  Oh man, to be on tour again seeing the boys would kill the doldrums something terrible.  Its really heart-warming to learn that Eddie is going to be a father finally.  Olivia Vedder. What a pretty name.  Sounds better than Arcadia.  ugghh. I really wish i was at that Finn Brothers show two weeks ago when Eddie came out and dedicated "Four Seasons In One Day" to his daughter.  SO i think these new Pearl Jam shows will be something special.  Thank God this is not a full-blown tour I would not be able to afford it.  A flight from Incheon to Tokyo to America.  That is going to cost  abit.  I think a flight to the states will run at least 1.9 million KRW.  Makes me feel better about not going anywhere for the school holiday coming up.  Though i am still thinking about going to Beijing for the Chu-Sok holiday.  argghghghg.  to top it off i still don't know if i want to vote for Kerry.  sigh.  In lieu of all this Pearl Jam tour frenzy comes devasting news.  the Boston Red Sox traded Nomar!     NOMAHHH!  He was a Boston institution for crying out loud.  No one had more heart than Nomah. The damn Sox break my heart every year.  Oooohh those freakin' Yankees....  **********  Carlos told me Lali's wife Michelle is pregnant again and due in November.  I am a bit miffed about it since no one told me.  I was hoping for a niece this time but its a boy instead.  Go figure.  Still not sure if i should go to Beijing.  I really love hanging with my UK crew and Hannah to boot.  Tracy is like big sister too. Yet, the price is high. hmmm.  there is no guarantee i can make it to the states for a mini-tour.  We'll just have to see how it goes.  At least i won't get slammed for the under-25 extra car rental fee garbage again like i did for the Coachella Fest.  I have been listening to so much of The Cure today i can almost remember the desert heat in Indio.  Ughhhh.  Its a shame that i am missing out on Kristen's wedding.  I'll have to visit them in Portland by way of Seattle if i make it out there again.  i REALLY miss Jason, Jamie and Rachel.  I guess Joni Mitchell never lies. "...you don't know what you got 'till its gone...."  If South Korea continues their internet censorship I will rescind it to being a second-rate Japan.  Freedom of expression is SO taken for granted in America its sad.  I really prefer my old journal to  urlLink www.blogger.com .  Laurita and i have been emailing back and forth for the last two weeks.  Its difficult for me a times since my Spanish grammar skills have eroded.  I can still inject meaning into my words by using familiar South American colloquialisms and idioms. My love for her grows more every day. I told her i was open to the idea of taking a holiday in Bogota after my teaching contract expires to go see her.  The last time i saw her face was about  two years ago maybe when i took her to see Faneiul Hall in Boston.  That was a long time ago....  So it makes me feel bad when Lorna told me South Korean Immigration caught Jason and are deporting him back to Peru since he has been here illegaly for 3 years.  He is currently in jail and his girlfriend Ana is heart-broken. He will pay a heavy fine and they will probably seize all his profits.  I just him two weeks ago at the 66.  He was such a friendly guy and really funny too. Its just so sad.  He came here after the World Cup 2002 and just stayed after his visa expired.  I wonder if Ana will go see him or will she just go back to New Zealand?  It was quite relieving to find a native Spanish-speaker, let alone a Peruvian,  in this part of Asia. I can express myself so different in my native language. Yet, with Jason gone i guess Kevin and i will have to banter in Spanish.  Kristen gave me an idea of spending X-mas in Kyoto since Paul and Heather will be living there for a while.  So much traveling so little money.   can it be done?   I just need to make my monthly quota for my Sallie Mae loans and erase my Discover card debt.  I will be alright i guess.  Still don't know if i want to go back to America next year, yet i am wicked anxious to go back to school. Parts of me feel aimless. just without direction. I'll just have to deal with it and figure it out.   As of late, i have been entertaining wild fantasies of become a writer.  i know its laughable.  I just finished a Tom Robbins novel, "Villa Incognito" and i was left wanting.  Wanting for clever metaphors and better character names.  Dickie Goldwire? What stupid name for a literary character!  Raskolnikov.  NOW thats a name.  I look at the text of that Robbins novel and of "Dance, Dance, Dance" by Murakami? and i say to myself even i can write better than this drivel!  I think i just wasted 4 years of school on wanting acceptance while my muse packed up and left me.  then again i left her first.....
