						   So I thought I'd give this a try. A buddy introduced me to this site and the natural writer in me was interested. I haven't kept a journal in years but I have a lot to say and I'm sure my friends are sick of hearing it. First let me say that yesterday my distrust of men as a species was reaffirmed by a weaselly (sp?) prick who failed to mention he had a girlfriend after a very good first date and promises of another. I of course shouldn't have been so naive at 26 and over a decade of heartbreak. But&nbsp; alas I was starting to listen to my male friends and most of my female friends that not  all  guys are complete two faced jerks. Silly me. I have decided to go back to my decidely male mindset and use them for just one thing. Who needs romance when there's oral sex. Don't get me wrong- I do NOT hate men. I just don't trust them like I do women. I bet most women feel like that but will never admit that to men. I don't really care anymore.&nbsp;Jaded beats heartbroken anyday in my book.  Well this is my opinion today. Who knows- maybe it will change tommorow. I have felt like this though for the majority of the&nbsp;last&nbsp;10 years. I am in group therapy now though with women and men so maybe I can get some perspective from their world (and it really is a whole other world).&nbsp; So keep checking back- you never know what might happen with me or what outrageous stuff I may write.

						   ok maybe not  all  guys suck. I am trying to be more openminded to the oppposite sex and I am starting to notice a few guys that are genuinely helpful, (mostly) honest, and even considerate of others' feelings. Maybe they were boy scouts. So thanks Dippy, film student guy, and a few others at my weekend job. And of course bodhifive who has showed me that, yes, a guy can have true feelings for a girl beyond just lust. (and no, unfortunately said girl is not me). Maybe even asshole J. had true intentions when he lied. (Kinda defeats the "true" part though don't ya think?)I'm also starting to notice that women (for instance some of my best friends...and yes even me) can sometimes be just as wrapped up in physical satisfaction as men and we too occasionaly make decisions less with our heart and more with our hormones. So maybe there's hope for me yet. I've finally figured out how to love myself after 26 years (and not just in the physical gratification way which I figured out when I was 10). Now if I could just figure out how to love men...or maybe someday one man. Or I'll just have to stick to women...but we're too high maintenance. As much as guys confuse me, we women are complete enigmas. As I told J. recently: "I don't understand half the shit  I   do" so how could I understand any other woman?

						   That asshole that reaaffirmed my complete distrust of men the other day had the balls to apologize today saying he was partly evil but still felt remorse. Like that should be somehow comforting! His explanation of men's behavior is, and I quote, "since the dawn of time men have been idiots- driven by urges and impulses they can only barely comprehend, let alone control." So that is a free pass for all men's misbehaviors then. That's the equivalent of a woman saying we can't be held accountable for any of our actions a few days every month because our basic human hormones control our free will. Even I as a sexist find that hard to believe. Well the old me would've accepted his apology and probably gone out of my way to start a friendship but I have learned much in my years and know that I have to look out for myself because in this world I can't expect anyone else to- especially men. I am lucky enough to have friends and family to look out for me but they can't always be there. So it is comforting to know that I can finally reassert myself and as one of my dear friends says, "put up my wall again, just for a little bit". I just need to not make the wall completely impenetrable but keep a lookout on the top so I can at least see the horizon. If I don't I just may miss the beautiful sunsets.
