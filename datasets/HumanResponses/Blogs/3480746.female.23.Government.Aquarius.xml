      I went to my cousins graduation last night. At first I was thinking of how much I like graduations, but how they're also kinda sad too. Then time passed as we stood for all 364 students to walk in and be seated. People were, of course, cheering for their sons and daughters, or in my case cousin, as they walked out. Thats all lovely, but then we have the people who bring noise makers, and some kind of stick things that look like the balloons (and as big, if not bigger) a clown would use to make balloon animals, and when you hit them together they make a dumb BAM! BAM! BAM! noise. And then there was the guy behind us who would scream WOOOOO! at the top of his lungs, he must have been related to the girl who would scream time to time for no reason. While all of this was going on, I realized I hated graduations. You have to arrive 2+ hours early to get a good seat/parking, they bring out the idiot in people, I don't know 363 of the people graduating, and while yes, the choir is lovely, I don't really want to hear them sing right now. Hopefully my feelings will change when I actually have a child and they are graduating.  So, a while after my cousin got his diploma, we left. We had to sit 5 miles above the actual stage, so I doubt we would have found him or my Uncle and Aunt anyway. Besides, i was with my grandparents, and we all know that grandparents+stairs+ 50,000 people trying to leave all at once= not a good plan, so we headed out while we could.  All in all it was a nice ceremony, and my grandparents kept telling me how "pretty" my "tape deck" was. Good Times!   Well, I'm at work right now, and seeing how I started this entry at 8:25am an it's now 10:51am, and I've chatted/gone to the bank/walked around the office -  aka not really doing much work - and my lunch hour is in about 10 minutes, I should be going.  Until then....comment!

      I've figured out that I can develop "crushes" pretty easily. Take the new UPS delivery guy. When he first came in, I thought his eyes were so...beautiful. I'm not really a blue-eyed type of gal, but even I couldnt deny the prettyness that are his eyes. (Is prettyness even a word? Or would should it be prettiness?) So anyways, last week I declared by crush for him to my boss/co-worker. They both said he looked like he was 12. 21-22, maybe even 18, but not 12. Well, he came in today wearing some very very V E R Y unacceptable black sunglasses/goggles on and he wasnt wearing his ups hat. Sadly, not only does he rock hideous sun glasses, he has what looks to be a bowl haircut and instead of having it lay flat, it's all standing strait-up (think Kid of Kid -n- Play) (P.S. His hair is about an inch long). So, it's safe to say that my crush is over. And before anyone starts to say (I said that like people are actually reading this) that I'm shallow or whatever, I believe he's married, because I did spot a ring.   I've also had a string of recent crushes, that I'd like to share with you all. Lets see....  There was the hairless guy (yes, hairless) from my church who is about 9 or 10 years older than I am. I spotted him at the movies drinking a slurpee with two straws. That just killed it for me,  no one over the age 12 should NOT be drinking anything with two huge slurpee straws.   Then there was the guy from work, who is affectionatly known as "The Wax Troll" around these parts. This one lasted for a month. We went out twice and things just sorta dwindled down. Him coming in one day with booty tight overalls on didnt help matters. And then he got fired and that was officially it.   These are nothing compared to the my long standing crush my beautiful man. This has been going on for 4+ years. Just about everytime I see him, "Me & Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine" starts to play in my head. Have you ever seen The Best Man? Well, you know that scene where Morris Chestnut walks into the bar or whereever they were at, and it's all in slow motion and he just looks so incredibly put together? Well that is how my Beautiful Man is. He could be wearing an old t-shirt and jeans and still make it look great. I could even see him drinking a slurpee out of two straws and say it was a-ok. Words cannot describe how wonderful he is. But of course I cannot find the nerve to speak to him, so I'll continue to lust him from afar.  I need gmail. I love Google. I use it everyday. In fact, I used 5 or 6 times while I was writing this. I tried to bid on an invite, but some rudy outbid me at the last minute. How are people getting these invites? someone needs to get me in the know.   In fact, I need to go investigate on getting myself a 1Gb account....
