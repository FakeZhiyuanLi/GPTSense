      I feel like just running away, away to a place where i could start over. Cuz this stuff with Dana is gettin worse every day. My mom forced us to buy him something for Father's Day, there are three things wrong with this picture, 1. hes not my fuckin dad, they arent married 2. I had to spend MY money on his two $56 shirts and 3. he didnt even say thank you for them. that is some rele fucked up shit. when we only got my REAL DAD one shirt. when MY DAD found that out, he felt like shit, and i was like, good job mom. and we are goin to oregon for a week at the end of july, its gonna be : Me, Adam, my gammy, mom, aunt carol, and aunt leslie. my grandma doesnt want dana to go, cuz she wants it to be like the old times. but my mom is throwin a fit sayin that she doesnt think its fair that he doesnt get to go. commin from the same person who went on two trips with jus dana, and is goin on a 9-day cruise w/out us, i rele think that she is being extremely selfish rite now. i just need to continue to get the smaller things off of my chest so that i can focus on this whole shitload of dana. and some ppl are helping, i would like to thank Kevin for helpin me get a lot off of my chest, and Kelsey, for being there for me, and allowing me to spill how i feel w/out worrying about you tellin anybody. THANK YOU to the both of you for helping me. i COULD NOT do this w/out you. talk to yall later.

      Last nite i got an email from my best friend kevin, and it was the worst thing i could have ever imagined, my other "best friend", is tellin him all this stuff that she swore she wouldnt tell neone. so i am rele questioning whether i can tell her nething nemore, but its not that big, its not like its the first time. And since kevin such a great friend, he realized that that convo was older than she said, so he threw it away, and then kevin helped me do something that felt awesome. since NONE of you could ever imagine what i am goin through, it felt awesome to let somethin off of my chest. but there is still so much more. i just need the ones who have been close to me to remain that way and i will be fine. Kevin, Eric, Jacky, Alex, with you guys here for me i can make it through the summer and start high school a lil less disturbed(couldnt think of another way to put it). peace and love to all.

      is it me, or is my life wasting away to nothing, i just cant belive that my life is coming to this. i have been trying to cope with it, and trying to accept it, but it is starting to eat me from the inside out, here is a song that describes me perfectly again,  Linkin Park- Nobody's Listening  Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it The number one question is how could you ignore it  we drop right back in the cut over basement tracks with raps that got you backin us up like Rewind that we just rolling with the rhythm Rise from the ashes of stylistic division With these non-stop lyrics of life living Not to be forgotten but still unforgiving But in the meantime there are those who wanna talk this and that So I suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt it goes  [Chorus] (Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening) (Called to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening)  I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress Hand full of anger, held in my chest And everything left’s a waste of time I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else’s more I’m riding on the back of this pressure Guessing that it’s better I can’t keep myself together Because all of this stress gave me something to write on The pain gave me something I could set my sights on you never forget the blood sweat and tears The uphill struggle over years the fear and Trash talking and the people it was to And the people that started it just like you  [Chorus] (Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening) (Called to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening)  I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress Handful of anger, held in my chest Uphill struggle Blood sweat n tears Nothing to gain Everything to fear  Heart full of pain, head full of stress Hand full of anger, held in my chest Uphill struggle Blood sweat n tears Nothing to gain Everything to fear  Heart full of pain  [Chorus] (Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening) (Called to you so clearly but you don’t want to hear me) Told you everything loud and clear (But nobody’s listening)  I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress (Nobody’s listening) Hand full of anger, held in my chest (Nobody’s listening) Uphill struggle Blood sweat n tears (Nobody’s listening) Nothing to gain Everything to fear (Nobody’s listening)  (scratching conclusion) C-c-come-come-coming at you from every side

      my birthday is coming rele soon, and my brother comes back from camp tomorrow. i dont know what to do anymore, maybe its best to quit, and let the self-hate take over, cuz its psyically and mentally draining, i am exauhsted, and its hurting me more to fight it, than if i just gave up, here is another song that rele touched me and describes exactly how i feel.    Linkin Park- Crawling  [chorus:] Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real  There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self-control I fear is never ending controlling, I can't seem  [bridge:] To find myself again My walls are closing in (without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure  [chorus]  Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting, reacting Against my will I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting how I can't seem...  [bridge]  [chorus x2]   and another song,  Linkin Park- In The End (It starts with one)  One thing, I don’t know why It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time  (All I know)  Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away  (It’s so unreal)  Didn’t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, but didn’t even know I wasted it all just to watch you go  (Watch you go)  I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time when I tried so hard  [chrous]:  I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter  One thing, I don’t know why It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard  (I tried so hard)  In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I’m surprised it got so   (far)  Things aren’t the way they were before You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me  (In the end)  You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time when...  [chrous]  I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know  [chrous]   thats it for now, talk to you later.

      forget what i said about me loving someone, after a serious amount of thought, i came to a conclusion, and that is, that i cannot love anybody and not tell them, and i cant tell them bcuz i ono y, but i just cant. so i dont love anyone, i dont care what anybody thinks, but it is true. my life is turning around, upside down, around and around. and i just realized, that i have lost my one and only confidant, the one person who makes me feel normal, i lost them, and i doubt i will ever get them back. look at this:                  Linkin Park- Breaking the Habit Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  I don't want to be the one The battles always choose Cuz inside I realize That I'm the one confused  [Chorus] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I had no options left again  I dont want to be the one The battles always choose Cuz inside I realize That I'm the one confused  [Chorus] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  I'll paint it on the walls Cuz I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  [Chorus] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit  I’m breaking the habit tonight                      These lyrics really touched me, i apply these everyday, i can feel a connection with these words, all of them.

      I need to think about a lot of stuff, im tryin to help my two best friends stay together, and every time i do i feel worse and worse and worse, my best friend eric is rele unstable rite now, and i just dont know what the fuck im sposed to do about all of it, its like the world is tryin to insult, everythin i do, everythin i hear or see, its about love, and two ppl being soo happy that they are in extasy (misspelled). and im just tired of being alone, and im tired of everything. i cant do anythin rite. as long as my friends are happy, i could care less how i feel. im just tired of not being recognized, but the ppl who dont see this are the ones i want to. I want freddie and i to bond and be like brothers again, cuz we havent been rele the best of friends since it seems like forever, or March, same thing. I just hope that he somehow finds this site and reads this, and realizes that i dont want to be like this, and that i want it to be like the old times, DC for example, stayin up talkin for two hours each nite, that was the best, i could, and wish i still can tell you nething, and you would help me deal with it, or give me a perfect solution to it. I hope we get a chance to talk about all of this, and that we can grow even closer, becuz now i feel so left out of your life, you never tell me anything, and i dont like it.
