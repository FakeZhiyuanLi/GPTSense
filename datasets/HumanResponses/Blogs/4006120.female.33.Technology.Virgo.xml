      ...was  urlLink Radiohead ...in my bloghead at least. I love this band, they're one of my most favorite among the many.  I first saw this blog thing when I joined the  urlLink Sun Star News Forum  some time back in June. I came across the blog of one of the members and I thought this was a pretty cool concept. I'm starting my blog, and this radiohead tune "YOU" is still stuck in my head and has been for days…" you are the sun, the moon, the stars, aahh you...and I could never run away from you "…it's bugging me already.  Ok, since I'm still trapped in the Radiohead mood, I decided to pick "Subterranean Homesick Alien" as my blog name/theme.  I am not a creative person. My ideas are never clever nor original. I am not a writer. English is not my native language.  This blog is an online journal to update my family and friends in the Philippines of my recent activities, thoughts, moods, blurbs, rants, ramblings, etc. My entries will not be intellectual nor amusing. If you want to find some good blog reading, you're in the wrong blogspot.  I'm not subterranean - not hiding underground, I do feel homesick sometimes, and I'm a legal alien of the U.S. And yes, this is one of my favorite Radiohead songs. Until I can think of a better blog name, I will stick with this one. There is no other special or meaningful reasons why so don't ask and that is that.    The breath of the morning I keep forgetting. The smell of the warm summer air.    I live in a town where you can't smell a thing, you watch your feet for cracks in the pavement.     Up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home,    of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits, drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets.       They're all uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight.    I wish that they'd sweep down in a country lane, late at night when I'm driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship, show me the world as I'd love to see it.    I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me, They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely. I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life. They'd shut me away. But I'd be alright, alright, I'd be alright, I'm alright.    I'm just uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight.    SONG INFORMATION Released: June 1997 Found on: OK Computer  Originally called "Uptight," which is how Jonny referred to it in its early staged, the song pays homage to Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues." It deals with alien abduction and stems from two incidents in Thom's life. The first occured at Abingdon School, when he was assigned an essay question that went something like this: "If you were an alien from another planet arriving on Earth, how would you describe what you saw?" The second incident occurred when Thom was driving down a country road and hit a bird (which he believes was a pheasant). He stepped out of the car and at that moment began thinking about alien abduction.  (song info taken from pitchfork media)

      i'm here. i finally did it. first time i saw this blog thing was over a month ago and have been thinking of starting a little journal for myself. a lot of stuff have been swirling around my head these past few months.  i'll be on the lookout for this evil  "ningas kugon"  though. i have a tendency to put the fire out just when i get it started. we'll see how long i can keep this burnin'.   (ningas kugon is a filipino idiom translated as something that is not permanent, usually connotes a behavior or action not meant to last)

       ...and more productive, a pig in a cage on antibiotics.  Last weekend was great. Started with another hike to keep this old body fitter, healthier, happier. On Saturday morning 9am, we headed on out to  urlLink Petaluma  to meet up with friends from work. One friend actually flaked because she needed to sleep in after a hot date Friday night. Aaah, i'm sure that was more exciting than the hike. The plan was to drive down to  urlLink Point Reyes National Seashore  in convoy this time - lesson learned after the last hike. The group lost 2 people the last time - it was moiself and the friend who flaked (haha, it figures). There were 4 cars, 11 people. It took us 30 minutes or so to get to the park. We decided to take the Bear Valley Trail which was pretty easy. This trail took us to the coast about 5 miles (8 km) to Arch Rock. After the first 3 miles, I was almost sure I could walk forever in this pace and weather but coming back of course I felt my back legs starting to get sore.   urlLink    The Hikers  I was extra excited this hike because my boyfriend Budz finally get to go (after months of prodding). He almost always have this lame excuse not to go because of work or have to go see his mum and sis as our friend Jay would say. I can't blame him though, he has a wonderful family (almost just like mine, tee hee). But hey, how many people do you know actually loves to hang-out with the fam every week? I bet ya can still count 'em with your fingers if you're lucky and with your toes too maybe. Most people I know always seem to stay away from their fam. I did, but that's a different story morning glory.   urlLink      The weather was perfect. It was overcast and cool. The trail was easy and mostly flat. I like trails that work you up to sweating like a pig sometimes. I don't mind little hills and steep upgrade as long as you get a break once in a while. It keeps the hike a little bit exciting. It's also nice to see plants and trees I've never seen back home. Ferns however are pretty common. I like it when they just cover the ground - probably what a fern farm would look like I thought. Growing up in the tropics, one will find the usual banana trees, coconut trees or bamboos. And the "no or low humidity" aspect always makes a world of difference.   urlLink    Budz in Bear Valley Trail  We saw an occasional deer family grazing around the bushes. There was also a little bobcat running around. I finally saw a gofer. This one was quite brave, popping his head out for minutes at a time...interesting. I've always seen the holes on the ground but never the creature underneath.   urlLink     The trail ended on Arch Rock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It was a beautiful scenery and a perfect spot for our picnic lunch. After working out an appetite and now the belly is full...and you can hear the sound of the ocean on the background and the waves crashing below...I should have brought a hammock, Budz sighed. The thought of hiking back another hour and a half seemed the least exciting.   urlLink    here's looking down the cliff   urlLink    Arch Rock  It was really not that bad. The hike back offered a sort of different view and scenery almost. I have to walk extra fast this time for a pee break. It's one of the bummers with outdoor activities especially if you're a girl. The perfect bush to hide seems always hard to find. By the time we were done Budz was aching for some hot bath and massage. Well, guess who's giving that tonight. I'm sure I ain't getting any this time but I'm keeping a raincheck.   urlLink     We finally got back home around 3pm. It was hot in  urlLink Santa Rosa , we hit the 90's (32 C) this weekend. We decided to kick back a little bit and planned to see a movie later. The place we're renting right now does not have an A/C so the movie theatre is the next best place to hang-out on hot summer days.  Then Barbi, Budz daughter, came home. Boy, did she have some exciting stories to tell! He was quite a young dad when he had Barbi, he was 21. Barbi just turned 20 a couple of months ago. She is such an adorable, cutest, littlest petite, lovable bubbly blonde I have ever met. Anyway, she and her friends went out to see an apparently "outlandish modern punk rock burlesk show" by the  urlLink suicide girls  Friday night. We thought half-naked sexy tatooed girls sounds interestingly exciting naughty fun. I have never seen a show like that ever. We're thinking of checking it out next time they're in town.  We decided to to see  urlLink Bourne Supremacy  instead of the  urlLink Catwoman  (my  urlLink tomato-meter  says it's rotten, the movie was rated so low). We sneaked in some hotdogs, sodas and munchies. Yah, we're pretty cheap like that, haha! We refuse to give our hard-earned $$$ to the concession stand. The movie was great. I haven't read the book so it doesn't really matter if they totally changed the plot (so I heard). It had one of the most exciting car chase I have seen, what a ride!  We had a pretty good day and the weekend wasn't even over yet...

      I was listening to  urlLink RadioAlice 's morning show on my way to work today. Sarah and No Name were just talking about Cher and her lesbian daughter Chastity's, coming-out book or something. They were not against gay or anything like that however I realized that there are still a lot of people out there that thinks otherwise. I don't really know what's the big deal with being gay or lesbian, man. I don't understand why some people have a strong dislike or irrational hate towards them. I have no problems or issues with them at all. I actually think they are fun and interesting people to hang-out or make friends with.  Growing up in the Philippines, it was quite common to have a gay or lesbian friend or a member of the family. We don't see them as different, they are always part of the community. Filipinos accept them for who they are, or at least that's what I think. We don't go around and beat them or  urlLink drag them at the back of a truck and torture them . Strange one might say especially in a country where majority are Christians - Catholics precisely.  Well, this brings a lot of memories from gay/lesbo people I know back home.  I wonder what happened to Ojie and his gay friends. He was a hairdresser who rented this little unit in front of our house. It used to be our little sari-sari store turned it into a beauty salon. Imagine how convenient it was for us five teen-age girls and then a few more girl cousins here and there. We sure kept them in business. I remembered Ojie and his gay friends were hilarious when they got together.   urlLink     found some baby pics. Here's the old sari-sari store - Kid A @ 2 with mum and Kid B.   I also have a cousin 3x removed who was gay. His name was Junior. I can assure you Senior wasn't too excited about him. He was gay alright but was not in any way like Ojie. He did not wear women's clothes nor make-up. He was nowhere close to being a drag queen. I could not forget about him because he taught me how to smoke when I was 19. Back then we thought it was cool. Now it think it's dumb!  Now, Junior has a lesbian sis, Abi. She was a total butch. The last time I heard, she wanted to be straight and realized she actually needs a man and wants to start a family. Hmmm, rumors always sound interestingly juicy.  I have another gay cousin 3x removed or whatever. His name  was  Jojo.  Was  because I think now he goes by the name Michelle or some chick name like that. He totally transformed into a pretty girl. And very feminine, more feminine than the females I know. He was beautiful, just like one of those Miss Gay candidates you see on tv (well probably not in US tv). Gay beauty pageants are big in the Philippines. If you get a chance to see these shows do check 'em out - it's quite entertaining.  I also have a lesbian (or so we thought) or should I say bi-sexual first cuz. Buloy as we all call her grew up to be a tomboy. Her friends from college would always think she was a lesbo. We all did. Then she came to the States and things changed. She started dating and fell in love with a guy. She has two adorable kids. She later got divorced. I always thought or noticed she's happier with a girl but she tells me otherwise. Whatever makes her happy makes me happy. She knows I love her dearly.  Whoa, I din't realize there's so many queer in the fam. The list could go on and on and on but I know one thing for sure they're just people like you and me, they can't help not to be gay or lesbian. Understanding, acceptance and tolerance is all we need.  Well thanks to discovery channel it kept me up on the new findings on transexuality and gender issues.  Recent research/studies suggest rather strongly that human sexual orientation is to some degree biologically determined and/or there is a physiological difference between the brains of heterosexual and homosexual men.  Sexual orientation is not a thing you can choose and homosexuality is not just about sex. I understand we - straight people - would say eow or ulk when we see 2 gay men kissing for example, simply because that is not our sexual preference. It doesn't necessarily mean they are bad or "dirty, sick" people. I don't think homos choose to be different, to be laughed at, picked on and be emotionally troubled because they find it fun to be condemned and judged.  If a woman and a man love each other what is it based on? Looks, Sex, Money or Love? Most likely Love, right? So if two people of the same sex love each other, what's so different? Love is love and that’s what it's all about.  No rainbow disconnection here. I support the  urlLink Rainbow pride  .

      Budz and I have decided we want to adopt  urlLink Eric Cartman . We realized it is impossible to resist his charm. Yes, we can live with this lovable opinionated little bastard running around the house.   urlLink     I can only imagine…  Cartman:  I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried something, I'd be like, HEY! You get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie!   Cartman:  Respect My Authoritah!   Cartman:  Why is it that everything today has to do with things either going in or coming out of my ass?   Butters:  We're not Christian, we just pretended to be.  Cartman:  Remind me to cut your balls off when we get back.   Cartman:  Hippies.They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad.   Cartman:  That movie has warped my fragile little mind.   Cartman:  I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.  Stan:  No, Jay Leno's chin is big-boned. You are a big, fat ass.   Cartman:  Well, Kyle, appreciate you being so open with me about this, but as we know, you have a warped perception of reality because you're jewish.   Cartman:  Well, I've been lickin' this carpet for 3 whole hours and I don't feel like a lesbian.   Cartman:  The poor kid passes it to the Jew, the Jew shoots. He misses! Proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!  Kyle:  Shut up Cartman! Your body is bigger than the goal!  Cartman:  No, I just have a sweet hockey body.   Mr. Garrison:  How would you like to go see the school counselor?  Cartman:  How would you like to suck my balls?  Mr. Garrison:  What did you just say?!  Cartman:  Oh, I'm sorry (Clears throat and pulls out megaphone), actually what I said was, "How would you like to suck my balls, Mr. Garrison?"   Cartman:  If some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, 'Hey. Why don't you stop ... dressing me like a mailman ... uh, and making me dance for you ... while you go and ... smoke crack in your bedroom ... and have sex with ... some guy ... I don't even know. On my dad's bed.  Stan:  Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?  Cartman:  I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.   Kyle:  Wow! That's a lot of seamen, Cartman.  Cartman:  Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.  Stan:  That's cool.  Cartman:  Yeah, and the sweet thing is, the stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck on a hose.   Cartman:  Now stop wasting Mel Gibson's time, you little pussy prick.  Stan:  Don't take that tone with me, kid. I'll kick your ass.  Cartman:  Yah. Well, I'd like to see you try. I'm, like, 6 feet tall.  Stan: Yah.  Well, you sound like a little bitch to me.  Cartman:  Bitch! Don't call me bitch, bitch!  Stan:  Bring it on then, bitch!  Cartman:  I already brung it, bitch. I brung it, opened it, and set it on the table, bitch.   Cartman (singing):  I want to get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus. I want to feel his salvation all over my face.    If you don't know  urlLink South Park  you wouldn't understand. Only Cartman can get away with this.

      I'm still debating who to tell about my blog thingy. This morning I emailed my two sisters about it. I have two other friends online from the  urlLink cebu newspaper forum  that already knows. And of course, my Budz. But when he read the  urlLink rainbow disconnection  entry, he thought that might upset my lesbo cuz. Nah...

      ...and so I did. At lunch break, Mirna and I did a 3- mile (5km) run. I went home for a quick shower and a bite to eat afterwards. I got a lot of things done at  urlLink work  today. I pretty much completed all my tasks and cleared up a few follow-up flags on my Outlook. It feels gooood to get things accomplished.  We saw  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate  earlier tonight. I enjoyed the movie. It was a good thriller, entertaining but can't really say I was wowed. I think Washington Post's review summed it up pretty much "A stylish hoot: entertainingly edgy and ludicrous all at once."  Anyway, here are the pics I got in my mailbox today.   urlLink    The "birthday girl"... my niece, Liv, who just turned 5.   urlLink    Liv, her kuya Grant and their cousins.   urlLink    Since there are 5 more siblings after me, i think having a dozen nieces and nephews sounds just about right. i miss them all sooo much. at least i get to see three of em in my email today. Sansan, Grant and Liv. Big smile for me!   urlLink    Here's a pic of moi and Liv 2 yrs ago. see the diff? she's grown a lot, huh.   urlLink    With mum (left - sitting, moi in the middle), cousin Lalaine (second from right, standing) and friends. [forwarded email pic, thanks Jan!]

      I like Fridays.  It's hazy this morning.  Low clouds, cool and misty...nice! A good day to run.  I got more photos in my mailbox from my sis Miyot today. And more pics of Baby Bro's bday party earlier this month from my friend Janis in LA. Will post 'em later...  I remembered dozing off to sleep with John Kerry's speech last night.  No, it wasn't boring. It was good. I was just tired. ( "I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side."  )  That was a good line.   The painters are here. They are going to re-paint our pink kitchen today. Gotta run...

      Soooo, I had Saturday night to myself. That doesn't happen very often ya know, once in a  urlLink blue moon  I should say. And indeed it was!  urlLink Did you get to check it out?   Budz and Barbi went to see Eric Clapton (lucky dawgs) in San Jose Saturday night. It was her "Father's Day belated present", very cool, huh? He wanted me to go and I would have loved to but I thought it would be great for them to spend some father-daughter time...it's been a while since they went to a concert together. And hey, we can always watch Eric Clapton next time around. They sure had a wondeful time!  It was actually kinda nice to get to hang-out with one of my good and oldest friend Tata again. We were co-workers and roommates back in the Philippines eleven years ago. She was also my old boss at work for a year or so until she quit about a year and a half ago. We and her hubby Juan used to hang-out a lot at my old place on weekends when I was living by myself. I remember the booze, munchies, 80's music, and a lot of old stories to tell and re-tell. It was fun, we always have a blast!   urlLink     Me and Tata. Bantayan Island, Cebu. 1993.   I scored some adobo cebu-style with the fish sauce dip and beef green currry for dinner and some cassava and torta cake for dessert last night (yums tums!). She's a very good cook. We always make sure we don't miss her parties. It's almost like a cardinal sin to decline or refuse her invitation.   urlLink     And another.   So anyway, we thought we'd take advantage of my little night out. We had a couple shots of vodka cranberry and some munchies while "story-telling-a-lie" as my mum would say while gazing at the beautiful blue moon until midnight.  I was home 6 seconds after Budz and Barb pulled into the garage. Perfect timing!  Today was easy like a Sunday morning. The whole day was actually -- very relaxing. We drove around and see if we hit some cool garage sales in the neighbourhood earlier today, but no luck. We did some chores around the house, watched tv and just kicked back until 5pm then headed on out for Budz's family dinner party.  We get to play and smooch the niece and nephews tonight and scored a delicious meal again! Sweeeet!   urlLink    Andy and Lilly

      My phone rang and Carla our receptionist/activities coordinator/customer service was on the other end:  Carla:  Hey, did you know that you're the only birthday celebrant in August?  Me:  Whoa...what happened to the other people?  Carla:  Um, they're gone...they've been laid off...  Me:  Serious?  Carla:  Uh-huh. Only one, your name is posted on the board in the employee lounge.  Me:  Really, oh dear...should I be worried? (sigh) I think I see a trend here. Am I next in line?  Carla:  (giggles) Anyway, what cake do you like?  Me:  Hmmm. I dunno, anything goes…  Carla:  Do you want a pie? Ice cream?  Me:  Hmmm. They all sound good to me. What would people prefer?  Carla:  Well you get to pick coz it's your birthday…  Me:  Whatever you pick. I'm not really a big cake or dessert person. I'm sure it'll be good.  Carla:  Alrighty then. Bye... (giggles)   10 seconds later, Birthday cake "meeting" was sent to all employees via email for August 26 at 2pm. Laid off, no job, birthday, scary thought. I don't want to be the only celebrant, I don't really like be put on the spot...waaaah!   My birtday is actually on the 23rd. Last night, Budz asked me what I want for my birthday. I dunno. Haven't really thought of anything...  1) I want new hiking boots. 2) I want a new pair of comfy walking sandals - black. 3) I want to try a bikini wax - a brazilian bikini wax. 4) I need a new haircut and re-touch on my higlights. 5) I want to fix my crooked nose. 6) I want to fix my crooked teeth. 7) Can I get new boobies? 8) All of the above.  Budz? tee hee...

      I had an eye doctor appointment at Kaiser at 2:20p today. So I got there just in time, paid the co-pay of $20, sat down, grabbed a copy of  urlLink "O"  in the waiting lounge, flipped through the first 3 pages of the magazine and then the doctor called me in. I don't like my eyes dilated.  So anyway, the doctor went through my records real quick, a little chit chat just to keep a little conversation going. Then he told me I'm not supposed to be there until December. Geez Lewis! I had to get up early this morning so I could come in to work at 7:30am to make up for leaving early today and for nothing? And of course, I have to go through the receptionist again and get all the transaction voided, etc. etc. Crap! Oh well, I'm not going back to work.  A little over a year ago, while I had my routine eye exam at Lenscrafters for my contacts and prescription glasses, my optometrist told me he saw something not quite right, he thought I might have a  urlLink retinal detachment . Whoa!  retinal what?   Budz and I had a conversation once that if I have to choose among the 5 senses which one should I give up last...Sight, Touch, Hearing, Smell and Taste. I didn't have to think hard on that one - the most important sense for me of course is Sight.  I was at Lenscrafters around 5ish then. Somehow, they got it all coordinated so quickly that they were able to set me up for another opthalmology appointment at Kaiser right away - that evening. Normally it would take weeks to schedule in an appointment but this time they were able to get me in so quickly? Now, all this rushing was scaring the hell out of me. My thoughts were already running wild at this time...Am I losing my sight? I'm getting blind! Am I getting an eye surgery? I'm getting blind! Will I be okay? I'm getting blind! waaaa!  I'm tellin ya, getting a  urlLink dilated eye exam  is no fun. Getting your eyes poked and eyelids stretched and eyes poked, two opthalmologist were taking turns doing this, was soooo not fun, it's discomforting! The diagnosis was the same, retinal detachment, it looks like...maybe. So they told me I have to see a retinal specialist. By 7:30pm, I was seeing a Dr. Meffert retino somethin' specialist. I was relieved to say the least. He told me it is not retinal detachment after all and even if it was I have to go in surgery right away. It was considered a medical emergency. The good news was it wasn't. I have urlLink  retinoschisis .  A retina what again? I thought.  It sounded too medical and foreign to me. He was only the 4th eye doctor I saw in the last 2 hours and a half, I should be feeling okay, right?  As it turned out, I  am  going to be okay. I will still see floaters every now and then. I always thought floaters and cobwebs in my sight was normal. Or sometimes I would think they were semi-hallucinations. When I was young around 9 or 10 years old I also thought maybe I had special powers. I can see dead people! Double crap, I was just defective. Now my doctor just need to keep an EYE on my EYES every 3-6 months and make sure it's not getting worse.  My doctor told me this is really not common for women in their 30s.  Well thanks, just what I wanted to hear to make me feel better, very reassuring indeed.  Hmmm, I'll just have to start thinking I'm special this way.  crap!

      We went to the  urlLink Sonoma County Fair  tonight. The place was packed. We wanted to check out the garden show which we always do every year. The theme this time around is "The Gardens of Camelot". I wasn't as impressed as the last time but they still put up a good show I thought.   urlLink    I took a few shots of some english garden landscape but some didn't turn out very well. Just love the blue hydrangeas on this one!   urlLink    Budz scopin'...   urlLink    ...there were some cool rock gardens...    urlLink    ...and some interesting looking plants.

      We saw  urlLink "The Village"  not by choice but simply because we messed up the times and theatre info for  urlLink "Collateral"  before headin' out to the movies tonight. Yeah, that's what happens when you get a buzz-on. The movie was lame, not worth-seeing in the big screen, wait for it in cable or something, you don't really miss anything. I say not even the good actors like Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody & Joaquin Phoenix could make me appreciate it. Lame!  However, the movie made me think of something else though. Every single time I see  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix , I can't help but think of the coincidences or similarities I have with him and his late brother River. First off, his brother River Phoenix and I share the same birthday, Aug. 23, 1970. No big whoa but I don't really know any other celebrities  (dead or alive)  who's born the same day as me, so...  Secondly, I always wondered if Joaquin's scar on the upper lip was congenital, an inborn scar like mine or if it's from a cleft lip repair surgery. Like a good celebrity stalker, I tried to find more information on his possible congenital deformation online, but no dice. I did not have a cleft lip nor a cleft lip surgery but I do have an inborn upper lip scar and a crooked nose - a nasal deformity associated with incomplete unilateral cleft lip maybe or something like that I think.  Oh well, lame movie alright but at least it still made me think in some other weird ways.

YES, we are off to  urlLink Kauai Island  in 7 weeks! for 8 days and 7 nights in  urlLink Plantation Hale ... I'm sooo excited and I just can't hide it...   Friday is always a good day!

      We went to the  urlLink city  tonight. We thought a quick drive down to the  urlLink Fisherman's Wharf  would be a good day trip especially since we still had that free dinner certificate from our last "city-weekend-play-tourist getaway" back in May.   urlLink    It's quite amazing how the weather changes so quickly in the North Bay Area. It was 93F (34C) in Marin then 20 miles (32km) down the road, just before you hit the  urlLink Golden Gate Bridge , it was 63F (17C). You can actually see the fog coming in.   urlLink    It is usually foggy in the summer time. So if you're visiting and want to see a good view of the bridge, plan the trip in spring (April-May) or fall (Sept-Oct) .  We were glad it turned out really nice when we got to  urlLink Pier 39 . We decided to chow down at  urlLink Neptune's . Great seafood din!

      I got a new batch of baby pics from my youngest sister Dikia the "Kid F", in my mailbox tonight. It's always as exciting as opening a present every time.  Here's my latest youngest newest nephew...ZEUS!   urlLink    Yeah Zeus, that greek myth god  urlLink Zeus . We also call him Zee. Look at that face, Oh sooo cute!  I don't have kids but I don't mind hangin' around with these little adorable creatures every now and then. I have two places now I call "home" - Santa Rosa, California and Cebu, Philippines. We seem to never run out of babies somehow. Yeah fun, huh? Really.  Here's another one with him running around...   urlLink    He is such a boy! He just turned 13 months old two days ago.  Yes, babies everywhere I go. Here I either get to play or babysit Budz's niece and nephews. And whenever I visit my cousin Lalaine down in Long Beach, two more kids there, too. And in Cebu, 12 nieces and nephews! They're not all babies anymore of course but half of them still are - I wish they don't grow up so freakin' fast. I miss them tons!   urlLink    He looks so adorable in his baseball cap. Can't wait to see him soon.   urlLink    I can see he's got that "chickboy" look already on his face. Oh Zee, you are soooo going to take a lot of smooch down from me when I see you!  It's always a nice thought to know that I can always "borrow" one if this "play-a-baby craving" hits me once in a while. And the best part of it all is I can always return them when they start getting fussy. tee hee.  ....And we also get to see Budz's sis Carol and his little niece Lily this afternoon...   urlLink     ...I spy with my little eye...something beginning with a letter L...Lillian! I love the baby goob!

      Sometimes I wonder if war or terrorism really is mankind's gravest threat…the thought of  urlLink "Gee Gee's"  are more seriously scary…not in our lifetime maybe…but it will happen eventually.  urlLink

      I just got off the phone with my friend  urlLink Tata . She already called twice this morning. First, to tell me she wants to throw a little bday dinner for me. Whoa! Sweeeet! I wasn't really planning to have one but hey…  …10 minutes later, she called again and asked me to send her a list of guests... already?…and I have to pick a day asap...  Ugh...the pressure!

      Okay, so I've been slacking lately but I'm glad  urlLink this  hasn't hit me yet, the interest to continue the journal is definitely still there. Let me see, what have I been up to for the last week...   Sunday . Not much going on, just drove around town hoping for good garage sales but no luck again. We have come to a conclusion that summer '04 is not a garage sale scorin' year. Anyway, we got to check out a couple of open houses along the way instead.   urlLink    This one had quite a view of the town. But not much to see on the house though.   urlLink    Beautiful view of Santa Rosa but for a million dollars? Crazy.  We killed time and just spent the rest of the day lazin' around...   urlLink    You see? Idle feet.  I had to get up early for an online meeting this morning anyways (charity organizatin on the works), so I didn't mind kicking back at all...watched  urlLink LXG  with Budz and took a quick nap.   urlLink     We smooched this anarchist baby all night!  Saturday.  Nice morning to run, overcast and cool. Did a quick 30-minute run in  urlLink Spring Lake . Played with the kids in the afternoon. Babysat Lilly for a little bit tonight - she spent the night with us.   urlLink     Here's Andy with his swing!    Friday . the 13th, easy day and always happy. posted a quick  urlLink entry .   Thursday.  Another employee wast terminated from work. This kind of news always makes everybody sad, worried, uncomforatable...for the rest of the day. sigh. Oh well.   Wednesday.  We tried to catch up on  urlLink Six Feet Under  and watched two episodes. We seriously need to do a marathon, we've been missing a lot. This is a really great show. We're sooo lucky we have  urlLink TiVo . You can almost play God with this thing, really.   Tuesday.  I could not find  urlLink this  cd. I don't like it when I can't find my stuff. It makes me feel old. I keep forgetting that I'm forgetting and forgetful. We also had bbq dinner with Barb's new friend Steve today. Good company, good food.   Monday.  We got a call from Carol 730ish tonight to let us know that Lily has been throwing a fit for the last hour or so because she wanted to see Goob and Kaiyen.  Goob aka Budz . Lilly has been sayin' "goob and kaiyen, that way" the minute after she picked her up from granny's after work. Went straight home and Lilly just won't stop cryin... "no papa…no paco…goob and kaiyen…that way…". Paco is the fam chihuahua... Yeah, Carol was right, she thought we'd appreciate that bit of information…it was sooo sad, poor baybee - she melted our hearts.   Saturday.  We saw  urlLink Collateral  . I enjoyed the movie a lot. I thought it was a good role for Tom Cruise. He's good at playing a villain - heartless and evil. I like how the movie was made, the shot, the angle and the use of music. It was violent but not graphic nor gory. It had substance. It was an intelligent and a very good adult thriller I think.   Friday .We grabbed a copy of  urlLink The Utimate Kauai Guidebook  at  urlLink B&N . Budz's nose has been stuck to this book for the last couple of days. We're trying to do this trip as cheap as possible but we have to spend a few bucks for must-do activities like the ATV waterfalls tour, the raft tour to Na Pali and the Luau. The rest is just going to be hiking, exploring the little towns, sightseeing, snorkelling and vegging out on the beach, stuff you can do with little or no cost at all. Aah, the best things in life aren't things after all. 5 more weeks and counting, oh the adventures!
