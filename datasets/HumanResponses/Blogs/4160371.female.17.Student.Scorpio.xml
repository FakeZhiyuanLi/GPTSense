       Yes, tomorrow is my last day at work at the local IGA. My last  DO YOU WANT PAPER OR PLASTIC . My last   I'm really very sorry ma'am  . My last  phone call over the speaker to the whole store  where I mess up and say ummuuhhhppaaaaahhhhuhhhhhhhhh p---paaaa---pPacker Please!!!! ---and slam the phone down not wanting the guy to come help me pack the groceries at all anymore, no matter how long the line and how grumpy the customers. My last goof-up where I say  $2,000.00 DOLLARS PLEASE --- oops I must have made a mistake somewhere ---and then the lady shrieks while I peer over the reciept and find where I typed in a price to one thing, didnt press enter or whatever and continued putting in prices making a long string of numbers.... not good.... I only worked at the IGA a little over a month. I never even memorized all the different pops! (whether they belong to the pepsi or coke price category). I'm still puzzled about Squirt. Hmm...  Last night I had a dream about this guy. This guy  I knew in high school . HA. That sentence comes so naturally yet I feel like an old person writing that. (Come on though---I just graduated!) In my dream he had an "I WISH I WAS IN ADVANCED CALC" personality and I had an outgoing, laid back personality---in real life its the total opposite. I like to think I'm laid back---and I am out of the school/work scene---but I  DID  WISH I WAS IN ADV CALC last year!!! ---->>>In the dream we also fell in love, blah-biddy-blah.  Today went pretty well at work (surprisingly). Although I did find out that there is a set time people are supposed to have lunch break when they work the 11-7 shift. MAN. Today was the first time the girl on the register next to me didn't say, you can go to lunch now----so I didn't go till 2:45. Geez!!! NO ONE TOLD ME!!! Man, was I hungry! Instead of telling me, I asked her and she made me feel stupid saying, you were supposed to go at 1:30...  My roomate hasn't emailed me in 3 weeks. And we move in together in one week. AHHHHH. I've sent her 2 emails since she last wrote me and I'm not going to write anyMORE till she writes me! Hopefully we get along along better in person.

       I cannot pick up my shadow   Or meet every person   But I hope to meet you.      You who I've never met before   Are in the dreams I forget   To keep the suprise.      The suprise of wonder   At the first time I see you   And my breathing stops.      It stops just for a moment.   Then I realize with awe,   I've found my destiny.

       Indeed it is---almost the start of my new life, or way of life. I soon start college. Very soon in fact. Too soon to comprehend---therefore I am writing about it...thinking about it....even if not exactly believing it. This is going to be my "college journal." I have gotten a warning from a close family member advising me not to bring a paper journal into my dorm room; I find that advice especially worth taking for the simple reason that I do not know who my roomate is. I know her name, that she is bringing a refrigorater, tv, and a dvd player with surround sound. That is the extent of how well I know her. College life is going to be interesting.  I get to quit my job in exactly one week. That is way too long, but comforting just the same. Then I will pack pack pack and do more packing and probably unpacking and repacking until I have everything I need and want to be with me in my new college life. I am sure that will take a week, but knowing me (I think I know myself....15% in all but about 100% in all regarding my packing habits) I will leave it till the day before I leave, wake up early, and pack all day until probably early in the next day and get to college exhaused and nauseated from nervousness. Not a very good combination.  At the moment I am wearing a stolen watch. My six year old sister found it while we were at the beach---2 minutes later I am alone and see a man with two young girls walking along the shoreline looking for something... I keep my mouth shut. Today my sister gave the watch to me as a present. How sweet.  At work today over the loudspeaker I said "Glen, pl--pla--plua--pl-plac-PACK please!" It was a very nauseating situation that I could not bear to think about but did probably for the entire half hour following it. I tried to make it funny when Glen came to pack the groceries. I said smiling, "Glen, plack please" as a joke and he smiled but I think he could see through my words into the deep pit of embarassment I was drowning in. By the way, Glen is the handsome boss' son.  A guy at work has feelings for me I think. I don't know if they're friendly or romantic. No one else at work has either for me and the sudden holding of the door for me, looking deeply into my eyes, joking (flirting?) with me makes me feel like his feelings are leaning a little more towards romantic. In a week I will be leaving and whatever his feelings are, they will probably remain unsaid. That makes the blushing and the lovely feeling that occured in my stomach seem like blank, depressing nothingness. I wish I knew his name... it would make me feel less of the blank &amp; more of the less confusing: whatever that is.  I will write again when I arrive in my new life and all the mumbo jumbo of being seventeen years old and unable to ring up alcohol at work and no one saying hi to me at work and calling packers on the loudspeaker for everyone in the entire store (people sitting on the toilet, in the breakroom, meatroom, everywhere) can hear (a little too) loud and clear---will be over.
