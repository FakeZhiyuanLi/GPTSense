       A two-fer today - I'm atoning for my blog-slacking sins here.  I just finished up Alexander McCall Smith's  The Full Cupboard of Life , the latest in his series chronicling the adventures of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The Botswana-set series has caught fire around the country and deservedly so.  The books beautifully capture the beauty of their setting while quietly sneaking in a wonderful dry wit and subtle charm.  I've never had much desire to go to Africa, but McCall Smith manages to make me consider adding Botswana to my already lengthy list of places to visit before I die.    I'm really rather surprised at how much I enjoy McCall Smith's books.  I'd kicked around the idea of trying out the series but wasn't sure I'd like it.  My mom, who's my go-to authority on all things mystery, wasn't too sure about it either but bought the first one on the strength of the reviews.  It sat on her shelf collecting dust for several months until I borrowed it on one of my trips home.  I figure if I'm already heading back to Chicago with 20 books under my arm one more isn't going to kill me.  I eventually got around to reading it and discovered a rather nice little gem.  I don't typically go for 'cozy' mysteries, but these have a seductive appeal all their own.  He's obviously a great writer - I don't think I would have gotten past page 15 of the first book if he wasn't.  My advice?  If you've thought about reading the series but aren't sure, give it a try.  Borrow the first one ( The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency ) from a friend (if you have friends who read, one of them is bound to have a copy) and give it a whirl.  You just might be pleasantly surprised.  But I didn't review this particular book, you say?  Piffle.  If you've already read the rest of the series, you'll buy this book anyway because you'll know what I'm talking about.  If you haven't, you need to start at the beginning anyway.  Go over to Amazon.com and bother them instead.  My blog, my rules.  Now scram.  Your books miss you.

       I've gotten a little behind in updates, as you can probably tell.  There's a lot of turmoil at the office lately and I'm just now starting to get a handle on things.  Thank god I have the day off tomorrow - it's such a welcome relief I can't even say.  First up for my new reviews is Ross King's  Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling , the story of the two great men behind one of the world's great artistic masterpieces, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.  I must admit a penchant for books about artists and the creative process, despite the fact that my own talents in this area are strictly limiting to stick figures, smilie faces, and the occasional Mondrian-inspired canvas.  King's book is certainly a fine example of the genre and he does an excellent job of showing the true granduer of Michelangelo's achievement while still recognizing that the artist was often hampered by his suspicious nature.  Interesting tidbits about in the book - I didn't realize that the Sistine Chapel was the first fresco Michelangelo executed since his student days.  Even given his prodigious talent, Michelangelo was severely hampered by his lack of knowledge about how to work in this notoriously tricky medium.  Also rather surprising is the fact that unlike so many artists, Michelangelo actually managed to get paid what he was owed for his work.  Considering the numerous wars his patron Pope Julius II fought during the 4 years it took Michelangelo to complete the ceiling, getting what he was owed is a testament to both his tremendous creation and his forceful personality.  While King's previous entry into the genre,  Brunelleschi's Dome , has been widely praised, if I were to only recommend one book of his I'd choose this one.   Brunelleschi's Dome  is very heavy on physics, which while a necessary requirement to adequately explain the magnitude of the achievement, it's tough slugging for readers like myself who aren't really physics people.   Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling  has the advantage in being a far less technical subject that makes for an easier and more enjoyable read.  I'd give both books 4 stars based on the quality of the writing and the obviously thorough research that they're grounded in.  If you're curious, King has also made an excellent foray into Iain Pears territory with his literary mystery  Ex Libris .  Definitely worth spending some time on if you like richly detailed, intricately plotted, and slightly quirky literary mysteries.

       I finished Lindsey Davis'  The Jupiter Myth  last night.  Solid, well-written, and rather funny to boot.  I'll definitely be checking out more of the Marcus Didius Falco series in the future if this book is any indication of their quality.  My full review should pop up over at The Mystery Reader here in the next week or so.

       Just had my first review published - pop on over to The Mystery Reader (link in the sidebar) and check out my critique of Stephanie Barron's  Jane and the Ghosts of Netley .  Look for more reviews from me on the site going forward - I'll mostly be reviewing historical mysteries.

       Since the Sureshot fiance was off studying for his board exams today, I took the opportunity to squeeze another book into my schedule.  This one's Iain Pears'  Death and Restoration , one in his Jonathan Argyll/Flavia di Stefano series of art history mysteries.  While the series hasn't received the same level of praise as Pears'  An Instance of the Fingerpost  (which happens to be excellent, BTW), they're more lighthearted and a pleasant way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  Pears' "serious novels" certainly deserve the praise they get, but his work in this series is perhaps unfairly derided for not being of the same intellectual caliber.  Personally, I rather appreciate a good author that can write "down-market" while still keeping the neat plots and excellent characterizations.  I'd much rather read Pears' so-called lesser work than some of the fawned-over excuses for literature that too often dominate the best-seller lists.   Death and Restoration  again follows our recently engaged art-theft-fighting duo embroiled in yet another unusual case.  The Art Theft Squad has received a tip that the monastery of San Giovanni is due to be relieved of one of its art works.  The tip seems dubious - there's not much of value in this monastery committed to poverty excepted an enormous (and thus difficult to make off with) painting attributed to Caravaggio.  Add in the fact that said Carvaggio is currently under restoration and you've got the makings of a useless tip-off, but Flavia decides to check it out anyway.  No sooner than Flavia begins to look into the matter, one of the fathers at the monastery is attacked and a small icon of the Virgin goes missing.  The theft is confounding and the recent arrival of a known art thief (readers of the series will recognize an old friend here) in Rome sends Jonathan and Flavia deep into a new investigation.  The mystery follows a variety of twists and turns as numerous suspects (the thief! the art restorer! the dealer!) are investigated and eliminated.  As always, with Flavia's police work and Jonathan's research skills, the couple manages to unravel the mystery behind the icon and its disappearance.  Part of why I love this series is how Pears manages to craft his stories in such a way that even when the perpetrator is known, there's still more to the story.  Rather than making the who the focus of his plots, Pears gets you thinking about the why also.  Motive matters in a mystery, and Pears heads that axiom far better than most writers in the genre.  He also avoids the common trap of not devoting enough time to the denouement of his story.  The mystery doesn't slam to a halt when the villian is caught - we get to see how all the players in the story come together to set things right again, in so much as they're able.  The decided lack of loose ends always makes a Pears book satisfying.  Definitely worth the time to read if you're interested in art history or Rome generally.  I'd put this installment at 4 stars.

       Just finished Penelope Lively's  Spiderweb .  She's a British novelist who won a Booker prize for one of her earlier works.  She's not big into plots per se - she makes heavy use of barely delineated flashbacks in the life of her protagonist to tell the story (roughly) of Stella Brentwood, a retired social anthropologist recently removed to a small town in Somerset.  After years of living a solitary, itinerant life studying various cultures around the world from a scholarly distance, she's suddenly finding herself trying to figure out how to live  in  the world, rather than alongside it.  Aided by the widower of a college friend, Stella slowly anchors into this new world.  Parallel to this 'plot' is a contemporary thread following a deeply disturbed family whose property neighbors Stella's.  In spite of all her training and expertise in understanding kinship structures in foreign societies, Stella fails to recognize the slow implosion taking place just over her property line.    Lively's a tough author for me to love, but I do like her work.  Her way with words is well-honed and wonderfully descriptive, but it's often hard to grasp what it is that she's trying to say.  Her books are rather intensely British - much less action-driven and more towards the realm of loose character study.   Spiderweb  is a true 'library book' - best read in that quiet, contemplative environment.  I'll give it 3 stars out of 5 - pleasant enough, but not a sock-knocker in terms of quality.

       Or not.  But I don't care.  You're trapped in this meeting with me for the next hour.  You're going to listen to what I have to say and you're going to like it.  Got me?  Good.  The Sureshot fiance pointed me over to this site - he seems to think that others would find my musings interesting.  Awww.  Boys are so cute when they're silly.    Ostensibly this blog is supposed to be about sharing my rather esoteric taste in books with the world for the greater good of humanity (right) but I imagine that my ramblings will only sometimes be on topic.  Thankfully there's no velvet hammer of Miss Alli (check out her hysterical Apprentice/Survivor/Amazing Race recaps at www.televisionwithoutpity.com - you'll thank me later) to moderate me into oblivion when I wander.    A little background on me for your edification:  I'm 23, live in Chicago, work as a receptionist for what has to be the most drama-laden 10-person office in the history of the universe, and I'm gearing up for taking the leap into married life on 9/4/04.  I'm also an avid reader and I'm currently applying to a slew of graduate schools with the hopes of getting my master's in library science starting this fall.  I have the most adorable little dog in the whole world - a black and grey cockapoo named Bunsen.  He is a cute and cuddly furbaby that I love to pieces.  Owning a dog is what it must be like to be a rock star - it's hard to imagine that any other living thing could be that excited to hear you come home from work.    That's about it for now.  Your homework assignment - if you haven't already, read Jasper Fforde's  The Eyre Affair .  Best damn book I've read in five years, easy.  If your sense of humor runs to the absurd, it's definitely your cup of tea.  With a good British scone.  Not that you can get those in the US.  Damn it.

       My posting is more and more intermittent these days - with the wedding less than two months away and my job hunt in full force, I haven't had an overabundance of free time.    Anyway, my latest entry is Isabel Allende's  Portrait in Sepia .  I enjoyed it, but I have to admit that it didn't make much of an impression on me.  It's not one I'll be rushing out to recommend to all and sundry but it's pleasant enough company for a while.  Considering it was a bargain buy, I probably ended up getting my money's worth out of it.  The novel traces the story of Aurora Del Valle, the illegitimate daughter of a well-to-do second-generation Chilean in San Francisco and a half-Chinese beauty from the burgeoning middle class.  As so often happens in these types of stories, Aurora ends up being passed from hand to hand, first living with her Chinese grandfather and then her Chilean grandmother after his death.  She's been traumatized by some unknown event surpressed deep in her unconscious, but she finds an outlet in photography.  Aurora relates the story of her life intertwined with that of that wacky cast of characters otherwise known as family.  I wish I could come up with more of a critique for this one, but I'm struggling to come up with anything that stood out for any reason, good or bad.  It's beige.  It's the bland, inoffensive music that's piped into stores and doctor's offices around the country.  Not good, not bad, just kind of there.  A bland book is the hardest kind to review because you just can't think of anything to say about it.  At least with a crummy book I can have some fun snarking on it as I review.  No such luck here though.    At least I should have more to say about my latest book for The Mystery Reader - this one is  Will Thomas'  Some Danger Involved .  It's pretty clear this is a debut novel; the style lacks the polish of an established writer.  That said, the story is twisty, clever, and eminently believable.  Anyway, I won't spoil the fun of the full review.  It should go live this weekend.

       Just finished up Jacqueline Winspear's  Maisie Dobbs  - flat out wonderful.  I should send a thank-you note to my editor over at The Mystery Reader for sending this one to me.  My full review should pop up over there by the weekend, but in the meantime I can't stress enough how much you need to read this book.  This book is the kick-off for a new mystery series set in London between the two world wars, and I'm looking forward to eagerly devouring further entries as they're published.

       Sorry for the paucity of updates lately - it took me the better part of a week to finish Jonathan Franzen's  The Corrections .  I'd heard a lot of really great things about this book, so when I saw it in the bargain bin for $6.99 I thought I'd give it a whirl.  It doesn't really have a plot per se - it's more a series of vignettes following the five members of the Lambert family as they make their way towards 'one last Christmas' together at the family home in St. Jude, a typical Midwestern town.  Father Alfred is suffering from Parkinson's and is utterly dependent on his social-propriety-obsessed wife Enid to survive as his body betrays him.  Their children, Gary, Chip, and Denise, are all so wrapped up in their own lives and issues that they actively try to avoid their depressing/uncool/juvenile/irritating parents as much as humanly possible.  Gary struggles with his marriage as his children become the weapons he and his wife Caroline use to manipulate and control each other.  Chip, recently fired from his faculty position at an unnamed university for having an inappropriate relationship with a student, dabbles in writing a terrible screenplay and borrowing huge amounts of money from his sister to support his shiftless existence.  Denise appears to be a highly successful restaurant chef, but her immaculate cooking hides a women careening from one bad relationship to another, a trajectory leading towards a breakdown of everything she values.  As this highly dysfunctional group tries to survive that most familial of holidays, they eventually come to understand, at least modestly, what drives the people they've been running away from all this time.  In some ways this book is a typical Oprah choice (I'll save my rant about that for another post) - dysfunctional family, suffering, depression, pathos, etc.  Thankfully for the reader, Franzen infuses the book with a generous helping of humor that prevents it from sliding into full-on suicide-inducing Oprah territory.  Some parts of the book are genuinely touching, while others leave you with a palpable sense of disgust.  It's hard to come away from the end really appreciating any of the characters as people.  That said, in many ways it's a realistic view on how people relate to their families.  We may share DNA with these people, but it doesn't mean that we understand them, respect them, or even like them all that much.  Franzen's satirization of the Lambert children's self-obsessed worldview is the true delight of the book - he skewers the "me-me-me-me-me" ethos of 21st-century life with aplomb.    Overall, I'm not quite sure that  The Corrections  lives up to the massive swirl of hype surrounding it (Yann Martel's  The Life of Pi  does a much better job there), but it's a worthwhile read all the same.

       Forgot to post yesterday to give my review of Nicholas Basbanes'  A Splendor of Letters .  I'm a huge fan of all of his books, and it's particularly fitting that I was in the middle of it when I got accepted to library school.  He specializes in 'books about books,' that genre so near and dear to bibliophiles everywhere.  This latest follows in the same vein as his previous works in this three-part series,  A Gentle Madness , which focuses on book collecting, and  Patience & Fortitude , which focuses on the the meeting between collectors and libraries.  In  A Splendor of Letters , Basbanes talks about how some books have managed to survive to today, while others fell victim to changing tastes, political and religious struggle, and the inevitable assault of time.  It's a loose series of vignettes about various books and their history (he touches lightly on Michael Servetus, the subject of the previously reviewed  Out of the Flames ), and they're all quite compelling.    However, what I really love about Basbanes' work is how he acknowledges the changing world of books and publishing that has resulted from new technology but still makes a compelling argument for the continued endurance of the delightfully low-tech book.  I'm prone to scoffing at those who say that the book as we know it will cease to exist in ten years.  I don't see it happening for the simple reason that I have yet to see any reason why e-books or Internet publishing (for anything other than academic journals) is appreciably better than what I'm using now.  Books don't make my eyes hurt from staring at a screen for too long.  They don't depend on batteries that require frequent recharging; can you imagine the battery crapping out on your book just as you get to the good part?  They're cheap, readily available, easy to transport, they don't crash, and they won't be destroyed if you accidently drop them.  Until a tech company can convince me that their product is better suited for the task, I'll stick with my old standby.    Finally, I've got a new review forthcoming for The Mystery Reader here in the next few days.  This one's for Ann McMillan's  Chickahominy Fever , a Civil War mystery set in Confederate Richmond in 1862.  I'll own that this is not my favorite subject matter, but issues with the story trump those objections.  I'm officially giving it three stars, but I'd rather give it 2 1/2.  Keep an eye open for my full review soon.

       Just got an awesome piece of news and I am completely unable to keep it to myself.  I just found out that I've been accepted to FSU's masters' program for library science, which is huge.  I've been waiting on pins and needles to see if I'd get in and to know for sure that I'll be able to get my degree at a solid school is a huge weight off my shoulders.  I finally feel like my vision for my future is starting to take hold and become reality.    I'll see y'all again in a couple of days with my latest review - sorry for the slow-pokiness, but life is busy these days.

       It's all the Sureshot fiance's fault - he knew that if he sent me to a book fair unsupervised with a credit card it would all end in tragedy.  The only thing that limited me was my arm strength, which has gotten fairly prodigious lately thanks to yoga.  I ended up coming home with 8 books for myself, 2 for my mom, and 1 for my dad.  One of my dad's favorite authors, Henning Mankell, gave a talk and I got one of his ( The White Lioness ) signed for him for Father's Day.  I got my mom a signed first of Peter Robinson's  Blood at the Root  and a signed copy of Tomie de Paola's  Strega Nona  - both should be hits.    Reviews of the books I picked up for myself will emerge eventually - right now my to-be-read stack stands 35 strong so I've got a lot of work to do!  Much to my delight, I did manage to snag a signed first of Jasper Fforde's  The Well of Lost Plots  from Booked for Murder, a mystery bookshop in Madison, Wisconsin.  Since a friend of mine is moving up there here soon (her going away party is tonight, in fact), I'll have an excuse to go to their store.  I also had good luck at the stall for St. Louis' Big Sleep Books - they had a great selection of signed mystery firsts and the proprietors (a mother/daughter team) are very friendly and really know their stuff.  I've added links to both stores in my sidebar.    As the t-shirt of one of the vendors at the fair proclaimed, "Friends don't let friends shop at chain bookstores."  Support your local independents - they have great selection and true 'book people' for staff.  Yeah, they may not be as cheap as some of the big chains, but they often have stock you'll never see at Borders or Barnes & Noble.  Part of what's so enjoyable about reading is the wonderful community that readers build, and independents are a huge part of that.  But they can't survive without our support.  One of my all-time favorite independents, John Rollins Books in Kalamazoo, Michigan, recently went under because it couldn't compete with the B&N just down the road.  It's a shame, and the loss has prompted me to support independents whenever I can.  It's not always possible, but it's worth making the effort.  When you're traveling, make a point to pick up the phone book in your hotel room and see where the independents are in the area.  Swing by - you just might discover a hidden gem.    For those of us who can't travel as much as we'd like (such as myself), more and more independents are taking advantage of the Web to expand their reach.  As I discover more of these stores, I'll add links to them so you'll be able to check them out for yourself.  Well, it's time to sign off and see if Smarty Jones can pull off the Triple Crown today.  Belmont has proved to be too much for a lot of great horses.  Will Smarty break the trend?  We'll just have to wait and see.....

       Perhaps a bit too comedic a subject line considering the book, but I couldn't resist.  I finished up Lawrence & Nancy Goldstone's  Out of the Flames  tonight.  It's about Michael Servetus, a 16th-century Spanish doctor/philosopher/theologian who was burned at the stake in Calvin's Geneva for heresy.  Servetus is now regarded as one of the founding lights of Unitarianism, but at the time he was writing his ideas were about as heretical as you could find.  Classic case of a genius who was ahead of his time - not only was he an accomplished theologian before he hit 20, he was also the first person to explain in print the basics of pulmonary circulation.  He's pretty much forgotten these days, but the story is a fascinating one.  Only three copies of his seminal work survive in modern times - one each in Vienna, Paris, and Edinburgh.  The rest were burned along with him.  I think this marks the first book by the Goldstones that makes a significant venture out of the book business.  While the book has its roots in the book trade, it's not the focus here as it is in their other work.  They're accomplished writers with a clear grasp of their subject matter - the research they've done is more than evident.  I love their style as well; the little tidbits of humor they sneak in are quite amusing.  It's sad to say that I laughed more reading this book than I did with the first 190 pages of John Kennedy Toole's  A Confederacy of Dunces .      Man, I really loathed that book.  I literally could not finish it.  I've had so many people tell me that it's so great, but I thought it was terrible.  I never cracked a smile.  I guess I'm just not amused by grotesque people.   Anyway, topic.  I have a big fondness for books like  Out of the Flames .  It's a genre I like to call "the history of the obscure," where an author devotes a whole book to some small historical topic and shows how it had a much broader impact than it might appear on the surface.  Notable books in this category that I happened to like include Simon Garfield's  Mauve , Simon Winchester's  The Map That Changed the World , Mark Kurlansky's  Salt , and Dava Sobel's  Longitude .  For some reason this genre really appeals to me.  I guess I just dig the notion that even the seemingly small or inconsequential can have a huge impact.  And now for something completely different, I've also just submitted my latest review to The Mystery Reader.  This one's Lyn Hamilton's  The Magyar Venus .  Should be up for your perusal in a few days, depending on my editor's schedule.  Finally, the Printer's Row Book Fair is coming up this weekend, so I'll be off checking that out on Saturday.  One of my dad's favorite authors, Henning Mankell, will be there so I'm going to try and get him some signed copies for Father's Day.  If you're in Chicago this weekend you should definitely check it out - should be good fun.

       Last review for today - as promised, it's Dan Brown's  Angels and Demons .&nbsp; Brown has made a huge splash over the last year with his phenomenally successful  The Da Vinci Code , and while that one is still awaiting my attention, if it's up to the level of this one it's sure to be a good read.&nbsp; My mother reviewed  Angels and Demons  for The Mystery Reader when it was just going to press, and ever since she's been badgering me to read it.&nbsp; I would have gotten to it sooner but she kept lending it out to other people!&nbsp; She's not a big fan of this type of book but she loved it - knowing that I love this sort of thing, she's been pushing me to read it.  While the plot is much too dense to fully recount here, here's a brief synopsis:&nbsp; A scientist at CERN, a Swiss research facility, is murdered and one of his inventions is stolen.&nbsp; That invention?&nbsp; Antimatter, which has the destructive capability to level a large city.&nbsp; The head of CERN calls in Robert Langdon, an American symbology professor, to investigate the murder.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The inventor's body is branded with the ancient symbol for the Illuminati, an order dedicated to the destruction of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; Landgon joins forces with the murdered scientist's daughter and travels to Rome to retrieve the antimatter and save the Church from ruin.&nbsp; Oh, and did I mention that all the cardinals have convened for the conclave to elect the new Pope?  The book obviously requires a significant suspension of disbelief, but it's a testament to Brown's talent that he's able to keep you engaged even at the plot grows more and more outlandish.&nbsp; It's true escapist fodder - the literary equivalent of a smartly done summer movie.&nbsp; I don't care that it can't happen; I just care that I'm entertained.&nbsp; I devoured the book in about a day&nbsp;and&nbsp;found it to be the perfect summer brain candy.&nbsp; Not every book needs to be highbrow fare - who among us hasn't struggled through a "modern classic" for a college course and wondered how anyone ever managed to finish it, much less decide that it's deeply worthwhile?&nbsp; Give me a swashbuckling, wild-and-crazy thriller any day - at least I'm having fun.

       Second up today is another recommendation from my friend Barbara - this time it's Mary Kay Andrew's  Savannah Blues .&nbsp; I'm not ordinary a fan of fluffy chick lit, but this one was worth the time I spent on it for the info on antiques that suffuses its pages.&nbsp; Mary Kay Andrews is a pseudonym for Kathy Trochek, a noted mystery who's one of my mom's favorites.&nbsp; I can see why my mom enjoys her work - she writes with a clever, breezy style that's instantly appealing.   Savannah Blues  follows Eloise "Weezy" Foley in the aftermath of her divorce from upper-crust Savannahan Talmadge Evans III.&nbsp; As a result of their breakup, Weezy is exiled from the townhome she loving restored to the carriage house in the backyard while Tal lives it up in the main house with his new fiancee, Caroline Santos.&nbsp; Needless to say there's ill will between Weezy and Caroline, but Weezy is slowly adapting to single life.&nbsp; She's immersed herself in her antiques-picking business and she adopts a lovable dog with a delightful habit of piddling on Tal and Caroline's flowers.&nbsp;   Unfortunately, things go south for Weezy at an important estate sale just outside Savannah.&nbsp; When she sneaks into the estate the night before for a bathroom break and a "sneak preview" of the goods, she makes a gruesome discovery - Caroline's dead body stuffed in a closet.&nbsp; Soon Weezy's the prime suspect in her murder, and she enlists the help of her uncle, the closeted ex-Catholic priest/lawyer and&nbsp;her best friend, restauranteur Be-be.&nbsp; To further complicate things, an old flame is back in town and wants to give it another try with Weezy.  Overall, it's an enjoyable read and perfect for summer - enough tidbits of info to be interested but still appropriate for the beach.&nbsp; Good light-hearted fun.

       I'm so far behind on my posts lately it's not even funny.&nbsp; Hey, you try juggling wedding planning, two jobs, your masters, and review writing and see how well you do!&nbsp; Sorry - I'm a little edgy these days.&nbsp; Stress is at an all-time high right now, but thankfully the world of fiction provides a much needed escape.&nbsp; The new season of  The Amazing Race  also helps, but that's only on once a week.   First up today is a book a good friend loaned me,&nbsp;Harrison Gradwell Slater's  Night Music , which introduces Mozart musicologist Matthew Pierce.&nbsp; After purchasing a bundle of documents at an auction in Venice that he believes to be the work of a young Mozart, Pierce is mysteriously summoned to La Favorite, an enclave owned by Vicomte Ren that is devoted to the study of all things Mozart.&nbsp; However, our hero soon finds himself embroiled in a deeper mystery as other members of the enclave are attacked and murdered.&nbsp; Fearing that his possession of the Mozart diaries makes him a target, Pierce throws himself headlong into solving the crimes and authenticating his documents.&nbsp; With an enormous cast of characters that could be suspects, Pierce has a long and difficult road ahead of him.    Night Music  is clearly in the vein of Dan Brown's hugely popular  The Da Vinci Code  (which I have not read, but look for my review of his preceding book,  Angels and Demons , later today), as it spans multiple countries in a frantic race to unravel a historical mystery with ties to modern murders.&nbsp; While the premise is intriguing and the historical details well-researched, it lacks the polish and sophistication of the better books in the genre.&nbsp; I certainly enjoyed the book, but it probably could have benefited from being edited more aggressively.&nbsp; While Slater tries very hard to make his protagonist likeable, it's hard to do when you're reading his lascivious thoughts about every single woman in the book, with the exception of the wizened grandmother with narcolepsy.&nbsp;   Slater also has a tendency to let his story run away from him, allowing sections of the book to dead-end without satisfactory resolution of the plot thread.&nbsp; It's not a huge flaw, but a judicious edit here or there would have made for a much tighter, more cohesive story.&nbsp; In the same vein, Slater would be well-served to exercise more restraint with the number of characters as well - it quickly becomes tiresome to try and keep the endless parade of attractive young women straight.&nbsp;   Overall, a decent first effort, but Slater definitely needs some tough love from his editor before his next book makes it to print.

       In my odyssey to get to the courthouse yesterday, I happened to go by an independent bookstore that I didn't even&nbsp;know existed - Centuries &amp; Sleuths Bookstore in Forest Park, IL. While I didn't have a chance to go inside, their website is now linked in the sidebar.

       While having to schlep my ass out to the 'burbs to do my jury duty was not how I'd hoped I'd be spending my day, it at least gave me a chance to finish my latest book, Margaret George's  Mary, Called Magdalene .  At least I didn't need to be there the whole day (since they dismissed everyone at 11:30am, yay!), so I have some time to post my review before the fiance gets home from another long day assisting gyne surgeries.  I'm a big fan of Margaret George's books - she's carved out a niche for herself as the grand mistress of hefty fictional biographies of historic figures.  Past subjects have included Cleopatra, Henry VIII, and Mary, Queen of Scots, weighty figures all.  In her latest she turns her attention to a famous figure whose life is virtually unknown - Mary Magdalene, one of the first followers of Jesus.  She's only mentioned a handful of times in the Bible, although there is a gospel attributed to her in the Apocrypha, a group of writings that for various reasons were not included in the Bible proper.  Despite being over 600 pages long, the book reads quite fast and the story is engaging.  It follows Mary's life from her early years through to her death in Ephesus at the age of 90, covering a wide range of events in that span.  Most formation among them includes Mary's possession by demons, an affliction which is only lifted when Mary meets Jesus in the desert and he drives them out.  From that point forward, Mary becomes his loyal disciple, following on his inevitable course to crucifixion, a decision that forces her to give up everything she's ever known and loved, including her young daughter Elisheba.  I certainly won't claim to be a biblical scholar, but I definitely find reading about the genesis of a religion fascinating.  I think that a large part of how religions can be misinterpreted is found in the lack of consideration for the historical context the religion was born into.  As much as a great many people believe that the Bible is the word of God, it's worth remembering that the Bible as we know it is at best a distillation of the word of God through human hands, and those human hands are guided by the prevailing opinions and attitudes of their owners.  When the first Christians put the teachings of their most holy man into writing, they did so with a particular intent to accomplish a particular end - the dissemination of Jesus' words.  That intent introduces a slant into the text that could be positive or negative depending upon your perspective.  It's not unreasonable to assume that the authors did some editing and made changes, even if the changes were merely aesthetic.  Translations of the text also have a huge effect - the King James version of the Bible was a translation commissioned with the express purpose of producing a Bible that supported monarchy, in direct opposition to the more "democratic" versions then emerging from Switzerland and Germany.  (For more on that subject, I definitely recommend Alistair McGrath's  In The Beginning ).    Anyway, back to the book.  A huge part of why the story seems so resonant and believable is George's depiction of the society in which Jesus and Mary lived.  Having that perspective goes a long way towards enriching our understanding of the religious teachings that emerged from that time.  George also does an amazing job of giving life, feeling, and attitudes to those that are only known to us through religion.  Like any believer today, Jesus' followers were not abstract, idyllically holy beings, but rather humans tied to the human world by human emotions and human trappings, like material goods and family.  Religion is a human product, and books like George's serve as a reverent but pointed reminder of that fact.

       Pretty much my latest review book in a nutshell.  I guess it was inevitable that I'd run across my first stinker for The Mystery Reader, and P.B. Ryan's  Murder in a Mill Town  is it.  It reads like a bad Lifetime movie starring Valerie Bertinelli, but now with 100% more hoop skirts!  Yuck.  Complete and utter drivel - I feel like I need to go read something terribly educational to clean my brain.    Yeah, so look for my eviseration (or review, depending on your take) over there soon.

       What?  I can't resist the snarky titles.  My final review of the day is for Carol Goodman's  The Seduction of Water .  I'm a big fan of her previous book,  The Lake of Dead Languages , so it's only fitting that I see how she does in her sophomore outing.    The novel centers around Iris Greenfeder, the daughter of a Catskills hotel manager father and a writer mother who never published the final book in a planned trilogy of fantasy novels.  Iris's mother Kay died when Iris was just a small child, killed in a fire at the Dreamland Hotel in Coney Island.  However, the circumstances of her death were mysterious: Kay checked in to the hotel as another man's wife, and the body of that man was never recovered from the remains of the blaze.  As is to be expected, Iris still suffers from the strain of not knowing what her mother was doing in that hotel, and why she never completed the book that would have cemented her reputation.  Many years later, Iris is living a mediocre existence, working a variety of odd teaching jobs to support herself, including teaching writing in English to recent immigrants and working with convicts at a nearby prison.  Her love life isn't much better, as she coasts along with a rigid schedule of Wednesday/Friday/Sunday dates with her artist boyfriend.  But all of that changes when Iris assigns a project about fairy tales to her classes, and she's inspired to find out the truth about what happened to her mother and reshape her own destiny.  While not quite up to the level of her previous work,  The Seduction of Water  is still a well-written and evocative book.  The ending has a heavy-handed, swelling-violin-music feeling to it, but otherwise it's a solid effort.  I got sucked into the story almost immediately and it moves along at a swift clip.  It's good reading for summer - deep enough to be interesting, but not so intense that you can't overcome sunshine-induced ADD long enough to get into it.  4 stars from me.

       My senior English teacher in high school wanted to paint this phrase over the door of her classroom, but she could never decide if it should be on the inside or the outside.  In her shoes, I doubt if I could either.  As Joss Whedon so elegantly proved in  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , high school really is hell.  Anyway, this well-known quote comes from Dante's  Inferno , the tale of the author's journey through the afterlife with the poet Virgil as his guide.  Dante wrote one of the most brutal depictions of Hell and its miseries to ever see publication, and he made no bones about describing the suffering of his enemies in great detail.    The  Inferno  is the jumping-off point for Matthew Pearl's  The Dante Club , a mystery about the real-life Dante Club, a group of writers and poets who undertook the first American translation of Dante in the late 1860s.  The group included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Lowell, among others.  The mystery begins when a prominent judge is found murdered and covered with maggots and flies.  Soon after a priest is discovered buried upside-down in a vertical grave with his feet charred to a crisp.  The Dante Club quickly realizes that the murders are horrific reenactments of the punishments doled out by Dante and they spring into action to try and bring an end to a vicious murder's killing spree.  I've had my eye on this book for a while, and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint.  Pearl's style is tough to get into at first because of his historian's devotion to preserving the tone of the era he writes about, but after 50 pages or so you don't even notice.  Red herrings abound to keep the action interesting - I for one didn't figure out the whodunit but believed it when it was revealed.  The historical depth and accuracy are truly astounding and are definitely a model worth emulating for historical writers everywhere.  I'm very picky when it comes to anachronisms, but my critical nature found nothing of note in that regard, which is always a good thing in my opinion.   The Dante Club  is a fine entry into the burgeoning genre of literary mysteries and Pearl definitely deserves to take his place amongst Umberto Eco, Arturo Perez-Reverte, and Iain Pears as a leading light in the category.

       I'm really really behind in my reviews, so you're getting a three-fer today.  I was away at my fiance's family reunion over the weekend and got a bunch of reading done in the car on the way.  Thankfully we didn't get grilled with a ton of questions about why our wedding is so small, when are we having kids, why are you having the wedding in Chicago, etc.  But in the spirit of familial improvement we gave my future brother-in-law a Queer Eye-style makeover that he desperately needed.  He's looking so much better it's sick.  He still needs to fix that unibrow though - I'm afraid that the only one who can get away with that is Bert from Sesame Street.  Anyway, it leads me to a nice segue for my first review today - Napoleon Hill's  Think and Grow Rich , which is the selection for my alumni book club this month.  It's one of the first self-help books ever published, with the first edition appearing in the late 1930s.  As an elder statesman in the genre, it's become something of a classic and is often imitated.  I'm not the type of person who reads self-help/advice books, generally speaking.  The only book on my shelves at the moment that would even remotely qualify for the category is Jeanne Martinet's  Artful Dodging  (which happens to be a personal favorite of mine).  Books in this genre strike me as so fuzzy and nebulous that trying to live your life in line with these books is a lot like letting your life be dictated by your horoscope.    This book, however, really does have some genuinely useful tips for making a success of your life.  It comes at an opportune time for me, considering that I'm job-hunting and I've gotten the big goose-egg in results so far.  The core of the book is centered around the idea that if you don't believe you can succeed, you probably won't.  Being a person who discourages easily, the constant admonitions of confidence, persistance, and faith are the type of thing I need to hear these days.  Some of Hill's theories are a little loopy (the most sucessful people have strong sublimated sex drives?), but overall his arguments are solid.  I don't think it's the type of book that would change your life overnight, but it would definitely serve as a good swift kick in the ass as needed.

       Once again I'm chiding myself for not getting my reviews up in a timely manner.  Then I remind myself that it's not as if anyone is actually reading these anyway, and then I feel better.  My latest review, Lionel Shriver's  We Need to Talk About Kevin , is a recommendation from my mom, who read it for her book club.  She enjoyed the book a lot, but allowed as how it's not the best choice for a book club where not all the participants finish the book before the meeting.  She's right in her assessment that your opinion of the various characters shifts rather dramatically through the course of the book, right up until the very end.  The novel is framed as a series of letters from Eva Khatchadourian to her estranged husband, Franklin.  Two years before the novel opens, Eva and Franklin's son Kevin killed nine people at his high school and is currently serving time in a juvenile detention facility.  Eva struggles to cope with the aftermath of "Thursday," as she refers to it, and uses her letters as a way to put all her socially uncensored feelings to paper.  Not surprisingly, Eva feels responsible for Kevin's actions and guilty about her own role in Kevin's disaffection.  Getting no answers from her bitter, cynical son, Eva retraces her life in an effort to understand how it all went so wrong.   We Need to Talk About Kevin  is a tough book to read because it strips away all the happy societal whitewash we paint over motherhood and family.  In some ways it's really rather depressing to think that it's possible that our love for those near and dear to us may be an affection on some level - a fiction we create because we know society expects us to love them.   That said, there's something meaningful in that level of candor, that ability to embrace the less socially acceptable feelings we all have.  In another writer's hands Shriver's subject could easily become a Hollywood schlock-fest, but in hers it's a deeply insightful portrait of what we all try to ignore in ourselves.  Definitely a worthwhile read and a great choice to discuss in a book club (but only if everyone promises on their mothers to finish it before the meeting).
