      as astute followers of the  urlLink Assistant webpage   will know, we're now preparing for our  urlLink first ever gig . This means working out a setlist and running through songs consecutively. It's tiring, We met up at  urlLink Strummers  last night and quickly turned our attention to which songs we'll play. There weren't any disagreements, but it was still a job whittling them down. In the end we adopted a more is better policy and crammed ten songs in. Pending changes, our set on the 11th should consist of  1. It's Alright 2. Losin' My Mind 3. Get Away 4. Bomba 5. Broken 6. Tonight 7. John Wyndham 8. Bad Vibrations 9. No-one need ever know 10. Reasoned  Running through them, it was only at the last hurdle that we fell down, the still quite new and unfamiliar  Reasoned  defeating us. No matter, the set sounded good although it's funny how individual errrors continue to slip in even where you dont expect them. Is there any song I've played more and know better than  John Wyndham?  I don't think so. But first I got the opening chords wrong and then forgot the first line. It's easy to go into auto-pilot sometimes and drift away. During one song I closed my eyes for a verse and chorus and felt quite strange when i opened them again, as if I had been somewhere else for a few minutes but the sound had carried on.   Of the songs,  Broken    continues to benefit from it's new chorus, Andy adapted his bassline effortlessly,  Get Away  seeemed almost instinctive for a change, with the guitar sound moderated and strict adherence to the rules the method at all times.  No-one need ever know  was bleedingly loud and taut, the keyboards crashing through the guitar, and  Reasoned  a tuneful and uplifting set closer, once we had it mastered.  Does the set sound coherent? Something I've been wondering ever since we started. I think it does, although where it fits in I don't quite know. I submitted our site to a couple of search engines this week and once again had trouble describing us. In the end I think I went for 'offbeat and angular indie rock', reasoning that in the abscense of an apt phrase springing naturally to mind, something which sounded journalistically desirable would do the trick. It seemed a shame to lable us 'indie' but it provides people with a better idea than my preferred 'pop group'. So there you go. I don't think the description was too lax, all things considered, and as I hinted when I began this rambling paragraph, I think an Assistant 'sound' is coming together. We don't sound  particularly  like anyone else, at least.  In the bookshop at lunch today I read an interview with  urlLink Thurston Moore  in some book or other, where he said that Sonic Youth lyrics matter as much as the music. Made me wonder why I have made such minimal effort with pulling lyrics together. Perhaps I should. Certainly you won't be finding any of my lyrics on the website for a bit :-)  Unless someone else puts them up :-(

       Day one.  But we didn't rehearse today, so I'll start with the last time we did.  Monday 10th November   All down to  urlLink Strummers  at usual 'cept Andy who has a cold, but all is well as we're in the mood for being noisy and swapping instruments. But first Pete has a new song, or a new idea for a song. Only thing is I can't get my fingers around my guitar part. In the end we swap over and I play the chords and he plays the lead line. It sounds good. I vow to learn the guitar bit properly, and to somehow make my fingers more stretchy.   Next, having bashed out a few of the standards, I put forward an idea for a new chorus for  broken , This means someone learning the backing vocals. But I'm rubbish at explaining it and, having tried to sing the lead and backing vocal simultaneously a couple of times, Anne-Sophie casually invents a much better melody and we give it a go. It sounds great; her phrasing gives its a gallic lilt which sounds amazing. Meantime Pete twists his guitar line around the new chords. Great. We're happy with that. It needs a bassine, but so does everything tonight.   Ali teaches me a cool trick involving the E string, a drumstick and a lot of reverb. Thank you Ali. This achieved, it was necessary to prove that Anne-So is a worse drummer than me. Alas, she isn't, but we 'jammed' merrily anyway with me creating absurd  noises on the keyboard. Ha ha ha. Andy we need you back - you hold us together! wheeeee...

      On Monday we did a song I've been working on for the last couple of weeks.  It often works that way. At one point or other in the evening there's usually a  stage when one or two people aren't ready to play; when Ali is sorting out his drums up or P is tuning his guitar. Tonight I started churning out the slightly sickly, grungy chords of my new song while we were setting up. Within minutes we  were all playing along, trying to get to grips with it's odd-ish timing. By the  time Andy has turned up (not long after; "Hi Andy, cold isn't it? The gig's off") we've added a chorus and it sounds great.   Having first started quietly and built the song up to a weighty squall, we  decide to turn the formua around and start at our loudest. This means the song starts suddenly and agressively, before the calm sets over and Pete's guitar notes begin to break through the noise. Given we only played it for 45 minutes, this could be one of our  best songs I think; I'll demo it and perhaps Anne-So, whose new, long, keyboard lead means she can join us in the centre of the room having previously been  confined to the edges, can sing it. For the sake of reference, I'll call the  song  urlLink  Sleepwalk  , though that'll probably change. Most likely,  having played it seething with the bitter frustration of losing the gig it'll  never sound so taut or malevolent again. Well.   Meeting once a week with friends who happen to play in a band tends to mean  the temptation is always there to put down your guitar and go and talk. While  Pete, Ali and Andy worked on an old song of Pete's (yet a new one to us) which,  frankly, was a little beyond my ken, me and Anne-So mucked around, settin up a second keyboard and musing on the possibilities of a six handed piano solo. Over our chatter Pete picked his way through a beautiful piece of melancholy guitar which we'll have to return to. From that we came to another of his songs, one which I think I heard him play at the  urlLink Sussex Arts Club  night the evening I met  him. Played on Monday - at first - I couldn't quite see how such a naked song  could be approached by the band, but once we got going with it and it picked up a fraction of pace it started sounding really promising - Anne So's keyboard throwing up some zig-zaggy notes which had me thinking of the clarinet lines on early  urlLink Mercury Rev  records. This could be a really good song for us, I think. It's when we stab at songs like this and run out of time that the passage of time between rehearsals seems to stretch on forever. I can't wait 'til Monday.   Looking back there's nothing to suggest that the rehearsal went badly; three new songs to work on, several bottles of  urlLink Grolsch  (sorry Anne-Sophie, I'd  forgotten the KKK) and nice to see everyone. But I think we all felt so disappointed about the news that everything seemed discoloured. Never mind; we'll make up for the lost gig and when we do maybe we'll play the new songs....

      ah, the words bitterly and disappointed have been (and will be) bandied about a great deal in the last 24 hours. Our gig is cancelled. We found out shortly before our rehearsal last night, and all feel pretty dismal and upset about it. It means we'll be hard pushed to play before Christmas (although we're looking into renting out The Sanctuary Cafe for the night to make up for it, though I don't think they'll have a night free in the near future). Sorry to anyone hoping the diary would spring belatedly to life with the arrival of live action. Ho Hum.  Far too dismayed to write a comprehensive report of last night's play, I'll do that later.

      A rare midweek entry given that, it being a rather grey and uninspiring Friday morning here at work, my thoughts are less on this afternoon’s transmittal meeting and more on the gig, to whit (a) why am I putting myself through this appalling ordeal, (b) will the A & R men of Europe converge upon us (somewhat unlikely, yes) and (c) would we benefit from some kind of hilarious / arch costume, to project us into the NME's 50 great bands who look exactly like The White Stripes list? And how shall I perfect my Detroit twang? Ah well, never mind. That said, I can't decide what to wear. Is this the ultimate evidence of the shallow nature of pop; that it somehow matters more that I consider my clothing than get round to buying that set of new strings I need? No, it has more to do (I think) with the fact that i find the idea of myself on stage, playing guitar and singing, utterly unlikely and I'm trying to make it more plausible. Positioning myself outside myself, thinking "what would he wear if he was on stage". Ah.

      One week to go now; last nights rehearsal was great - bashing out the set and picking holes in our selection; deciding to finish with a combination of Andy's newest song (a lilting, tom-rich drumbeat and a cheeky bassline) and our smoking song (which basically consists of forty seconds of discordance and shouting) and thinking that sounds great, thanks. The latter song is there because it's too much fun not to play; we fleshed it out a bit, me and Anne-Sophie taking it in turns to belt out the words, but the whole thing still comes in under a minute; better to end the set with a yelp than a whimper.  So that's just one more rehearsal to go until the gig. I can't tell how nervous I am / will be yet. What is nerves and what is excitement? But I am in that dazed and perpetual state of near-nausea and reckless bravado, imagining how it will be, a schoolboy hurtling towards something like his first kiss. Good stuff.

      A proper rehearsal today, though no Andy, who is off encountering the psychedelics of Love tonight (the pop group, not the emotion). When one person isn’t at a practice it always seems a little strange, you can hear the gaps where he or she would be. Funnily enough though, when you know, for example, a bassline quite well you can kind of hear it in your head even when it isn’t there. Nevertheless, it isn’t quite the same.   Tonight was good though; we played a few of the oldies, slowing cranking ourselves up in volume with each song, and Ali making idle adjustments to his drumkit and sabotaging himself in the process, via new, wrongly weighted drumsticks (sheesh, what a muso) and his adjusted bass pedal. Of all the oldies I was best pleased with  Get Away , which we tried to imbue with a little of yesterday’s carefulness, and managed to find new spaces in the noise. Turning to new songs, we had a great time with  Sleepwalk , which is shaping up as a great little song, churning away grungily for the first half before Pete’s guitar goes off like a sparkler at the close, leading us to a chiming countrified end. It sounds really nice.   I’d put together a couple of demos in the week and we spent a bit of time working on one of my new songs, which I think we called  Islands  though that might change. Victoria has accused me of ripping off XTC on this one, and she’s right. It was one of those songs which we played together quickly and satisfyingly, though it needs work. Another simple and maybe promising one. We ended, as is our wont, with an abrupt version of  I want a cigarette , within which I screamed myself hoarse. It hurt.

      The first in a happily active two days of Assistant activity, just when I was wondering when I'd next get the chance to play. Last week Victoria got a new job which was such good news it felt wrong to rehearse, so while the rest of the band went along as normal and played without me, me and Vic stayed in. Or rather, went out and had a celebratory drink.   So yesterday afternoon, when I went over to Pete's flat to play guitar for a couple of hours, it was, if you'll pardon the expression, fuckin' great. Really nice to do it, and strange that some of our songs seem to work so well acoustically, even Get Away, which tends to get pounded into submission when we play it as a band. Some observations though... I am knock-elbowed; shifting them outwards to accomodate a stretched-out chord is near impossible - I need someone standing nearb y to wrench my arm outwards at the crucial moment. Secondly, my fingers hurt. I sound like I'm moaning now, don't I? Thirdly, I love playing guitar with other people.   I couldn't be less like a bedroom-bound guitar-huggist. Playing alone usually leaves me irritated, unless I happen to chance upon something I like; I don't play just for the pleasure of playing. But I love intermingling the experience of playing with someone else; it's fascinating and fun. It also seems improbable, creating such an improbable sound; all the notes bouncing around off eachother.  Afterwards we went for a drink with Victoria and Andrew. The Belle Vue, the pub at the top of our road, has recently been bought out by the owners of The Freemasons. They've added some lights and hiked up the prices. Hmm. Thanks guys. But we went to The Freemasons for the first time and it's lovely. We aimed for one pint and ended up drinking three or four, as usual. My obsession growing, I talked about html. What has happened to me?

      Been spending some time working on the  urlLink website , and finding it quite enjoyable actually learning something about it - went through the site yesterday adding meta tags and all sorts of instructions to robots, and enjoyed doing so. I am a techie at long last. I clearly have my priorities wrong, eschewing the rock and roll life and immersing myself in javascript. Thankfully, that's not wholly true, although the rock and roll lifestyle hasn't quite kicked in (good). Actually, you wonder whether any of us are 'living the dream' - Andy can be found extolling the virtues of  urlLink Chichester Council's   Rights of Way department these days (as a sliver of evidence), and Anne-Sophie is decamping to Luxembourg, leaving us with a 5 month long no-keyboards-void! She will return though and is Assistant. Meanwhile we went to the pub last night rather than a gig at Casablancas. Ah well. Happily we're not totally devoid of musical inspiration - I spent twenty minutes editing a drum loop from  urlLink Can's  'Hallelujah' last night, inspired by Andrew's recent forays into  urlLink Reason , a computer music tool thingy. Which brings the circle back round to computers! And now I must abandon my diary to write cover copy for a book on (eerie, this)  urlLink javascript . (because i am at work, and m u s t    w o r k    m u s t    w o r k    m u s t   w o   r     k        ) ah.

      Went to the pub with Ali and Carrie last night and tried to make some plans for the coming months. Some of the things that we're going to try to do in the next month or two include.. - finishing off old songs; we've got about six or seven unfinished songs which need tidying up and being sent off into their world so that new ones can grow in their place - recording: we're thinking we might try to get a live studio recording of our set; not through an MD, a proper recording - gigs: we'll get some - possibly trying to play with the fantastic  urlLink The Feline Dream , whom we like. - demos; we're building up a list of local press / industry / gig contacts but if anyone out there knows of newspapers, venues, clubs or websites which may be of interest, or which may be interested in Assistant, do let us know by emailing us at assistantbrighton@yahoo.fr - we're always grateful to friends, and have long memories...

      (spots pattern emerging) No rehearsal last night as Ali's band,  urlLink Over Sea Under Stone , played at the Freebutt - me, Pete, Anne-So and Sam went to cheer them on; they were loud and a bit pissed off; few new songs and um it looked like they didn't want to be there. I'd still take them over a million Electric Soft Parades or Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disasters though. But Luke, really... stop wearing sunglasses. Please.

      Ah, I like Christmas carols, although I realised the other day that, the odd memorable bit aside, I don't actually know the words to anyway. Any sing along instigated in the Shipley household would mean a lot of 'hmm nnng la-la-la'ing. Luckily, no such chore was required; a few dirges buzzed away on the radio in the background, but  urlLink Christmas  back in London with my family was a reasurringly irrelegious affair - the nearest we got was a Bob Dylan compilation I bought my dad (Dylan was, apparently, God, but the he went 'electric' and became the Devil, something like that, I dunno, I'll ask Pete).   Well we didn't get another rehearsal in before Christmas, which is why the site hasn't been updated for a couple of weeks and the diary has no new (pretentious, I'm informed) musings. So today's diary entry is rather less band-related than usual. I haven't yet seen everyone from the band again so I dunno how their Christmasses went -well, I hope. Rehearsals and diary entries proper will resume again soon, I promise....

      On Wednesday 19th February 2003  urlLink Assistant  became a figment of reality. It was one of the strangest and longest days in memory, actually, seeming to last forever as the day shifted agonising towards our set, and then to rocket by in a flash as though time was being stretched out like an elastic band and then pinged back fast into normality.   At around 11am I had a phone call from Ben, the thoroughly nice bloke who runs the Bootleggers Ball, telling me that, amongst other things, we’d be headlining the night, which came as a bit of a shock as we assumed that we would in effect be the third band in the scheme of the things. As it turned out, only ourselves and  urlLink The Candidates  played. Nevertheless all of a sudden the wait until we were on was lengthened yet further. Headlining would mean we wouldn’t be on stage until midnight. Which left plenty of time, of course, for nerves.  But it didn’t actually quite happen that way – all along I thought that I would feel terrible before the gig and fantastic during it, but I didn’t feel too bad – if anything more nervous on stage that off. When we started playing I didn’t relax instantly the way I thought I might - it made me think of being in a car and being unable to apply the brakes; one has to just keep going and turning the corners. But we didn’t crash.   After a really long day we met at the venue at 7pm, and carried out our first soundcheck; I suppose it was at this point that we were at our most panicky; the dynamics of am empty club are strange, cold, and a bit intimidating. Conversely Ben and  urlLink The Candidates   urlLink  were welcoming and friendly. Once we were on stage and playing it felt amazing, actually, although again it’s a disorientating experience – the temptation, particularly, to put one’s head down and sing through the nose at minimal volume is great. But it doesn’t work that way – to  make yourself heard you have to really project. Actually, credit should go to Andy here, who ripped through  Bomba  with gusto. Soundchecking  Losin’ My Mind , with it’s glottal stops and half-spontaneous lyrics made me feel extremely silly, but the other band met it with it with warm, kind applause. Suddenly a cloud of nervousness was lifted, for which I have to thank them, and us, for it was at that point when I first thought ‘maybe we’re just like any other band, not something which will incite pity or embarrassment'. So I felt OK from there.  Yet the downside of soundchecking so early and playing so late meant that we now had three and a half hours to kill. Ali, once more showing a sensibility beyond his years decided to go home and relax. Anne-Sophie, Pete, Andy and myself, demonstrating a mentality symptomatic of our lifestyles, went to the pub, but not until we had met up with friends – Victoria, Sam, Andrew, Chris and one or two others. It was a comfort to know that there were people around who would treat us kindly, and good to see people like Chris travelling to Brighton to see us. Good work. Arriving at the venue we found further friends; Carrie, Jeanne, David from  urlLink The Feline Dream  and various other mates. Thanks for coming down to those people.  All the same the reality tends to kick in at this point and you find yourself thinking ‘my god, is this really happening?’. Several times throughout the night I found myself suddenly remembering that I would be onstage in a matter of hours where I had all but forgotten moments earlier.    urlLink The Candidates  went onstage at about 11.15. We were lucky to have such a nice band to be playing with us; the singer even going so far as to intimate they were there to ‘warm up’ the crowd for us.  urlLink The Candidates  themselves were, I thought, very good – tuneful, classic indie pop with warmth and feeling. The singer in particular was charismatic and funny, a good frontman. They were at least as good as any number of bands in the limelight at the moment. Hopefully we’ll get the chance to play with them again, and maybe we could warm up their fans next time.  Once they finished there was a lull as we suddenly realised that in the following moments we would have to get ourselves together and prepare to play. I seemed to spend the entire next twenty minutes on the stage looking nervously at my guitar and out into the crowd, who had gathered in reasonable numbers around the stage. I still didn’t feel that nervous, but instead like a bit of an imbecile, awkwardly out front when I wanted to be tucked into the crowd. We didn’t know when to start. We got pretty much ready and then me and Pete went and bought a beer each. We must have been nervous by then because as I write this my stomach is churning a little with tension, remembering how it felt. Now I can feel my hands tingling a bit. But we got on stage OK and the music stopped. I decided not to say anything until the first song was over. And then we played  It’s Alright.   Everyone warned me in advance that the easiest trap to fall into is playing too fast. And falling to me as it did to start the first song, I scrunched my eyes up and tried to play it slow. As the opening chords came out it sounded like I was playing them at half the usual pace. By the time the drums and bass had joined in I realised the pace was right. Which just goes to show how difficult it was keeping the songs under control. The song went well though – Ali curtailed the close as we had discussed, reasoning that although it’s tempting to be as difficult as possible, doing so in the first song when you’ve already dispensed with the idea of having a chorus may not be the most inclusive idea. So we cut it short, and did it right.  From there on in (for a while) it was pretty good.  Losin’ My Mind   we played a bit too fast but after that  Bomba  and  Broken  were much improved. Playing  Get Away  I thought to myself ‘This is probably as good as we’ve played’, and I think I was right – when we get this song right we sound fantastic. It's strange that this song seems to have just evolved into something without us directing it. I can't remember how it all came together, who suggested which chords, when the chorus acquired lyrics, how we managed to impose some kind of form onto it - but it works well. At the gig we gave this one everything we had. We sang and we smiled and we bashed at our guitars until they were thoroughly, hopelessly out of tune.   And had no tuning pedals to help us correct the problem. Obviously it’s common practice to have them but we didn’t really give it much thought and didn’t have time to get ourselves back in tune onstage. It was awkward. The remaining songs were done well enough but everything was accompanied by cautious glances between us as we tried to work out just how mis-aligned our de-tuned strings were. There was a definite loss of confidence. At the time, I felt we'd blown it. An over-reaction, judging by the kind and enthusiastic reports we got afterwards, but I felt a bit shaken and upset that the good start hadn't been maintained. It seemed so obvious too that it would happen, and that we didn't have the means to get it right felt so unfair. Of course, if we had brazened it out a bit more people might hardly have noticed, but...  It didn't matter, not really. Of the remaining songs  Freaks  in particular stood out as a song that'll just get better and better, and the rest probably sounded pretty good too, but for the fact that that feeling of confidence had gone a little; it does make a difference you see – it’s the difference between singing at full pelt and falling away, between really playing with conviction and abandon and going – to an extent – through the motions. But when we finished the crowd cheered, and it wasn’t long after that that we had time to think and realised 'fuck it, we  enjoyed  that'. And we can be much better next time. We will be.  And how does it feel being on stage playing? It  is  scary, but it   is exhilarating. It  is  exciting, buoying, brilliant, but it needs confidence and it needs you to be able to say 'fuck it'; it can be a strain to stay on top of the momentum and a strain to keep your head. But god, it's  fun .   Most of all, though, it's over much,  much  too soon.

      not having been that good at keeping up with my diary recenty, I feel like a guilty husband who has to return home to tell all. Okay, not that bad but I sympathise with him if he ever thought he had nothing more to say to his wife. Maybe that's what happens when you keep rehearsng without other diversions along the way. But I'm not saying that recent rehearsals have been boring or that any of my enthusiasm has dampened. Nevertheless, I was wondering what I would keep writing about the band and our slow march of practice sessions on this site, what I could say which wouldn't bore you (the hypothetical you) to tears, or worse, which would singularly fail to do justice to the giddy pleasure of being in our band. Despite the fact that we were just rehearsing and not playng live or recording, I haven't been bored. But finding the words to reflect this enthusiasm is very difficult. Maybe I find it easier playing guitar than I do writing? I don't think so, but all the same, where do you go when your diary becomes a weeping wife? Why do the boring keep these things? Why be reminded?  But (there's a but), there has been some news. So now I get to confess all, and finally write something interesting.  First (and best), Assistant will be playing our first ever gig at Casablancas in Brighton on Wednesday 19th February 2003. Details can be got from the Assistant website. The night is known as The Bootlegger's Ball, and is a new (and seemingly successful) Band Showcase night; three bands playing and running from 9.30 'til 2 in the morning. We don't yet know what time we are on but we've been promised a 30/40 minute set, which is really good, as it cuts down the problem of culling our set (of which more later) and means we have time to play a few songs. I don't know who else is playing yet either, but the increasingly in-the-public-eye Clearlake headlined last week, so I don't think we are dealing with quite the same level of amateurism as we did in our ultmately fruitless contact with The Toad last year. Pete went to watch the first night and noted all the (reassuring or panic-inducing?) signs - the sound is good, the evening was well attended. And we may be nervous but we are also ready, so I'm looking forward to it unashamedly, without reserve. About fucking time, too.  2. And bad news always follows good. Well, news which has sorrowful ramifications for the band anyway. Anne-Sophie, our dazzlingly continental keyboardist, has just got a job in Luxembourg. Of couse,this is jolly good news for her, but it means that she is leaving us, at least she is assuming that she does not come back to Brighton. In the hope that she will, we're calling it a sabattical. Who knows though - she'll be greatly missed, and not just coz she makes cool noises. This makes attendence at next week's gig doubly essential, I need scarcely hasten to add - if you want to see the five-piece in all it's angular glory, that is.  3. Not so much news, I suppose, but an update on rehearsals is probably due. Mostly we've been working on refining the set, although we've found time to do some more work on Freaks (now sounding really great) and Sleepwalk (complete with gorgeous intro and a bit less clutter). Trimming our songs down to a setlist has proved really difficult, of course, particularly when people have preferences. Pete and I were musing on how hard it must be to pull together an album. Nevertheless, we decided on a setlist consisting of...  1. It's Alright 2. Losing my Mind 3. Bomba 4. Broken 5. John Wyndham 6. Get Away 7. Tonight 8. No-one need ever know 9. Reasoned 10. Freaks 11. I want a cigarette.  Having said that, with one rehearsal to go... who knows. This time next week we may be playing a 40 minute bass odyssey.

      New songs then. We've worked on three in the last few weeks. The first week  after we finished the demo we decided to have another play of one of my older  songs - You should know - which has hung around on the edges all this time  without ever being worked out. We added a kind of instrumental section to the  verses which, back home when I was trying to work out words, became a a nice,  high pitched, dramatic chorus. Playing it together again Pete added some backing  vocals and we reversed the quiet verse / loud chorus approach of the demo to  make it a little odder and sweeter. It sounds good.  Next we worked on a great song of Andy's which, on first play, came across a  bit like an early Blur number. By the time we'd mucked about with it a bit it  had acquired a slightly darker hue but retained a big, rolling chorus which  would have not have been discarded by even the most discerning of late 80s  indie-dance acts. It doesn't have a name yet I don't think. But it's a really  good one.  Lastly, a rare day off from work earlier in the month gave me the opportunity  to turn a short bit of guitar I've been playing for a while into a whole song -  probably the song I've been most pleased with since I wrote Losin My Mind nearly  a year ago. I'm really enthusiastic about it; it's kinda Smithsy, Idlewildy -  potentially much more of a 'song' than my usual efforts. We only played it  together briefly last week. But it's next on the list. Being for once proud of  the lyrics, you can read them  urlLink here ...

      The longer you leave it the harder it becomes to write. That's one kind of fact. But another is that the longer you leave it the less is required. Details which might have seemed essential a few weeks ago don't seem to matter so much now. So I don't have to go through every middle eight.  So what have we done this last month or so? We did a demo, which meant I had to re-write some lyrics, having failed to revise the improvised ones I'd come up  with when the songs were written. So I did a little but they seem to have  acquired meaning without still very much meaning anything at all. Although they don't mean what I might once have thought they would later mean, instead they mean what I was thinking when we wrote the song. They recall that experience, and for me their meaningless doesn't seem to matter so much. It  becomes part of the point of the song. Hmm - maybe I try too hard to rationalise my laziness. But if I am attracted to the first take of a guitar line and reluctant to perfect it (which I am, and see no problem with) why do I feel nervous about the words? Because they are words, and I know what words mean, I  suppose, whereas notes and chords are alien things which I can strike if I wave my arms frantically in the air. I think. Ah well.  The demo came out really well; recorded fairly quickly, pretty much live and without too much fuss. You can hear the four songs  urlLink here . We're pleased with  them, so pleased that we plan to do some more soon.  This done, there's a strange kind of release. Hearing the recordings back was like readng a letter from a child that you'd released into the world; a letter that told you they were getting on fine. That was one less song to worry about. Or four less, rather.  here's a good link -  urlLink Agony Andy

      Once again I am fillin in details retrospectively, which is not really the way I wanted this diary to be updated but I've been busy lately, so.  Last night (I'm pretending this was really written on the 4th March) we did some more recording. Readers who don't remember any being done in the first place can be reassured by the fact that I never mentioned it. But last week Andy, Pete and Ali recorded two tracks using Ali's fabulous 8-track recorder, and we did two more today. We've been weighing up the idea of going and doing a proper studio demo for a while now but in the end worked out that with Ali's equipment (and considerable talents as a producer) we can get four tracks sorted out during our normal weekly rehearsals. Today certainly seemed to bear that out. I haven't heard the products of last week's session (Bomba and No-one Need Ever Know) yet so I'll just concentrate on what we did today.  Which was basically whizzy, no frills but great-sounding instrumental demos of Losin My Mind and Get Away. We did our thing. Ali bashed away at his drums (at a deafening volume), me and P hacked at our guitars and Andy played all sorts of scattered, brilliant basslines what you can only hear proper once you've recorded it, or you're not thrashing away at your guitar elsewhere in the room at the same time. We did a few basic overdubs, marvelled at the technical wizardry of Ali, and packed up.  And bands spend years in the studio! Next week - vocals and a bit more guitar... then we should be done.

      back into the studio last night! or rather, back into the rehearsal room with Ali's 8 track. He recorded the drums to six songs a month or so ago and we've been sitting on them ever since waiting for an opportunity to add to them. Last night we put guitars and bass on four of them -  sleepwalk, tonight, john wyndham  and  it's alright . recording stuff is about striking a balance that you can only master once you've had a bit of experience - the novice is drawn to one of two camps; being wilfully neglectful and not clearing up mistakes, or being really anal and wanting to do everything 50 times. I guess I come down towards the neglectful side, only because I err towards thinking everything we do sounds great, and because I love so many records that are in some way flawed (there's a great song on Pavement's 'Watery Domestic' EP with a few dropped drum beats which I wouldn't have smartened up for all the tea in Sussex). Plus I read that XTC biography (Chalkhills and Children) and saw how Andy Partridge's perfectionism and pedantry made every single album a trauma and seem a compromise. Not that I compare last night with a month in a garden shed being terrorised by Todd Rundgren. Anyway, so we recorded quickly again, fixing the odd mistake but not worrying unduly. It gives you quite a sense of satisfaction, making these loud noises and then just letting them be; far better (I reckon) then getting obsessional. We'll do two more next week, and vocals.

      Two bits of news to be going on with... 1. The Assistant website can now be found at the flash sounding http://www.assistant.org.uk, or  urlLink here , if you wanna go there right now. There's a new message board, too 2. We're (probably) playing the Pav Tav again on June 12th. Keep an eye on our  urlLink news page  for details.

      Last night's gig at the Pavilion Tavern was a success in just about every way I think. Having played the first gig without really relaxing I kind of wondered if you ever did, when you were on stage in front of people. But at this one we were confident and relaxed, really enjoying the experience. The Pav Tav, despite what you might think, is a really good place for a gig (at least the wooden decor complete with crests upon the windows and earthenware pots on shelves behind the stage tickled my imagination) and the set we played was a definite improvement.  urlLink Her Own Escape , who we supported, were very good, sweeping, overwrought and dramatic and featuring some fine guitar playing (apart from the solos, which were probably good but I think solos are generally pretty horrible unless it's me or Pete playing them). They were young and dedicated and impressive. Vic said that when we played we were very different; grinning and laughing and drinking - but I don't think that matters. I'm neither studious nor detached, and, furthermore, I rather think I am a fool. I looked up lots more during this gig and, I have to say, I liked the attention. Couldn't stop grinning like an idiot though. It was a good show.

      Tired and hungover today; out with James and Becky last night which was nice - James's job is going well and he gets to bring home stuffed animals, and Becky has a cool new haircut. We went to Triple Trax at the Belle Vue which seemed to consist of lots of different DJs playing the same record (a notable exception for the chap with a very small head - not much bigger than an acorn - who played  Bad  by Michael Jackson).  Spending much of this weekend packing, I think, though hopefully I'll find some time for a bit of recording. Have written a few new songs in the last month or two and am slowly piecing them together using Reason. They're generally pretty good, kind of frail, spidery songs with tuff bass lines and metronomic drum-beats. They're nice, half-songs with half-tunes and half-lyrics. But using Reason is a long process; drawing in the notes slowly, my computer crashing, not having enough time. I can't remember the last time I strummed my guitar.  Here the weather has been abysmal but it's just brightening up. Please give me a weekend.

      Ah, a really busy day at work today. Last night we went over to see Andrew and wish him a happy birthday; ended up drinking champagne and playing with his  urlLink new midi keyboard , sparking off a happy, fresh new obsession. Well, considering the parlous state of my finances, not  too  happy.   A splendid  urlLink article on Idi Amin  in the Guardian today by Giles Foden. The cover of his book, The Last King of Scotland, has transfixed me periodically in bookshops over the years. Perhaps I shall read it now.   Meanwhile, Assistant re-convene on the 5th August. It's official.

      Seeing as  urlLink Assistant  are on something of a summer holiday, I thought I'd use this as something more of a personal blog for a few weeks; it's a nice summer but pretty much all I'm doing is flat hunting and preparing to move. Well, actually, am pretty much there now, but it's a busy few months. No Assistant activity for a while, but I have a few new songs and we're getting ready to go again.  There was a good article in the Guardian today; an interview with the wonderful  urlLink terry hall  - his new album sounds interesting; with Mushtaq from Fundamental he's produced a pop album which blends (apparently) hebrew with arabic vocals. Somehow Hall manages to be both earnest and near-mute without sacrificing his amazing charisma. Anything he does, I will always be interested.  Meanwhile, the new album from recent Warp signings  urlLink !!!  (pronounced chk chk chk) is amazing, and  urlLink XTC  are still, emphatically still, the greatest band there has ever been.

      All sorts of shifts and changes in the Assistant world lately - me and Vic have been away and moved house, Pete has (currently) about 10 minutes left of his job before he moves to pastures new (well, just down the road), Anne-Sophie came back from Luxembourg, then darted off to Egypt for a holiday, and is coming back this weekend before (gasp) moving house next week. Andy and Ali remain, thankfully, as solid as a rock and the model for any rhythm section. Somewhere in the midst of all this Assistant have tentatively begun to reconvene. But, true to form, even we've been shifting - so, awkward and hopeful as ever, expect our new stuff to sound newly twitchy and awkward with the return of the keyboards and a new Roland 303, and a bit of Gallic phrasing on the vocals. Still, it's many months since we all played together - hopefully in 8 days we will have. So there's something to look forward to.

      Brighton is, I'm told, buzzing with excitement with  urlLink Radio 1  down to stay for the week. Apart from a noticeable increase in young men with feathered hair in the Station on Monday night, I've not seen much evidence. Last night's  urlLink Careless Talk Costs Lives  gig at the Albert was nominally a radio 1 event, but there was little to denote the fact except a banner behind the stage. It was the Everett True show, really - he compered, DJed and - as his alter ego  urlLink The Legend!  - played the second set of the night.   I've wanted to see  urlLink La Momo  for ages, having admired their website and influences previously, and they were no dissapointment, better than the first band on stage has right to be. Doing that hyperactive space-rock thing with a clattery drum machine and a bit of gusto, they were occasionally brilliant - when the singer added a tom drum to the mix they invariably sounded twice as good, just as they did when their odd and stretching backing vocals added peculiar harmonies. I really enjoyed their set - they made me think of The Residents 'Hello Skinny', which was fine.  The Legend! did a good job, it must be recorded, of emptying the room. One wonders whether their set (beer and poetry over taped piano and a squalling guitar) would be tolerated if it was anyone other than Everett True centre stage. Probably not. Nevertheless, I'm not being deliberately provocative when I say that I enjoyed the set through my furrowed brow, and - alone it seems - never once willed it to end until the final few minutes when it was, perhaps, going on a bit. All the same, it was a kind of hotch-potch of Simon Munnery, avant-mode Sonic Youth and - best of all - Gavin Bryers' unequalled 'Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet'. It was laugh-loud funny in places and I could have danced to it if I wasn't so inhibited. Nevertheless, should anyone tell me it was self-indulgent, over-long and embarrassing, I wouldn't be able to argue. Still, see them once, do.   urlLink Miss Pain  know how to dance. Or at least, their singer (confusingly also named Miss Pain) does. Miss Pain (collective) are an elegantly conceptualised synth pop act with dashings of punk guitar - Goldfrapp and Huggy Bear in air-hostess uniform. I envied them their lovely keyboards and their bravery. They dispensed Mills and Boon novels, circulated a mirror to be kissed, sang through a megaphone and fell over lots. Their songs were called things like  urlLink 'Campari and Sex' , but I saw them having crafty swigs of Grolsch between songs. It kind of gave them away. They were great.

      I always tended to write  urlLink Billy Bragg  off on account of his stullifying earnestness, and I certainly don't recommend too much listening to his music. In isolation, however, some of his songs are stunning, and - all round - it's pretty hard to resist the general feeling of geniality towards him.   Went to Waterstones at lunch and read some of Michael Moore's new book, the brilliantly named 'Dude, Where's My Country' and noticed ruefully that the book is priced at £17.99. Whose side are you on Mike?! I can't remember Billy Bragg, an equally direct if rarely as funny kind of activist, ever pricing himself so out of the market. Indeed, his new triple CD (though a retrospective) is only eleven pounds. I know this because, after going to Waterstones (or the pub), going to MVC to see what dross is on their listening post is my wasting-my-lunch hour-method of choice. The choice is usually pretty crap, and the only good record on there recently (the new album from the intriguingly un-starry  urlLink Siobhan Donaghy ) I've already heard. But the Billy Bragg record was on there today and I thought I'd listen back to some of those early songs which, despite their earnestness, bear repeated listening (I suggest three years apart, or every time Tony Blair does something right, whichever comes soonest).   urlLink Between The Wars  still raises hairs, crackling on the nape of my neck. But how naive it sounds now - and how far away his sentiments seem. It's the kind of song that makes you want to belong. But how? Can I really claim that my England is 'the green field and the factory floor'? Or hanker after England 'Between the Wars' And what do you when that history hasn't been passed down to you, or is as unfamiliar as an overheard conversation? You stand in MVC until your lunch hour ends and walk back to work wondering whether you can pay £17.99, or £11.99, for someone else's heritage - Flint, Michigan or Barking.

      Lots of reading recently; the Guardian is going through a purple patch at the moment, with great recent articles by  urlLink Jon Ronson  and Michael Moore, an interview with  urlLink Rod Liddle  and more besides. The new Martin Amis novel - Yellow Dog -  is deliciously Amisian, as was the following exchange, reported in the Guardian   On Friday's Night Waves (Radio 3), Martin Amis talked movingly about getting older, writing, and smoking. He was brittle and brilliant on the subject of hostile reviews from younger writers. "The Matts, the Nats, and Theos and Jeds... I only have to see these Christian names to know I'm going to get a  urlLink stinking review . If they're called Brett or Toby, I've had it. They're Christian names and I'm a surname in the most horribly resonant way."    And still enjoying, though still perplexed by the musical references,  urlLink Blissblog .   I sometimes think I would rather read about music than listen to it - there are many bands who I have read about and felt transfixed by the idea of, who in reality have in some way failed to meet the expectation I had; have not matched up to the hyperbole of their reviews. I don't mean rubbish like The Libertines or The White Stripes who are talked up and never deliver, but the kind of bands whose description summons up oblique and unfamiliar concepts which are out of the realm my experience.   So when I read about the icy robotic future-funk of Kraftwerk I imagined something very different to what I heard (and liked) later on. Later still I heard a little known group called Clatterbox who sounded exactly as I expected Kraftwerk to sound. That doesn't happen very often. You can't get their record now but I'll copy it for you if you  urlLink ask . Still - imagined music can be more real that the real thing, and the real thing a disappointment - witness The Residents, Van der Graaf Generator, Lee Scratch Perry, Pole, 'Sandanista' by the Clash, early Detroit Techno, OutKast, Syd Barrett, Aaliyah.   That's not to say that those artists aren't (sometimes) brilliant, but they sounded better when I was just imagining their 'electronic dub / pyschadelia / pre-punk prog / progressive hip hop etc. Anyway. Looking again at Blissblog I notice that Simon Reynolds says of a piece of writing...   Course I'd much rather prefer to read this description than actually listen to a Dillinja record these days   So it's not just me. Anyway, spent much of last night listening to Dizzee Rascal and the convoluted point to all this is.... that his record is every bit as magnificent as the writing of Reynolds and  urlLink Alexis Petridis  led me to expect.

      We had a fun rehearsal on Saturday; Pete was in Oxford and, though it's never as good when one of us can't make it, it usually gives us an opportunity to spin off in a different direction. We rehearsed a few new songs -  urlLink Easy to Leave , which is coming together around it's 303 spine, and  urlLink Vine to Vine , which Anne-Sophie sang, and which sounded much better for it. The rhythm of the song is misleading and I always struggled to play the (easy) guitar line and sing the chorus simultaneously, so this way I could play the guitar with a bit more vim, and Anne-So's got a better voice than me anyway.   Then we worked on a new song of mine, 'Engines and Anvils' and completely deconstructed it. After a bit of tinkering, it begins with a loping piano riff, adding drums, a weird guitar riff (which we eventually disposed of - Pete can resurrect it perhaps) and an evil sounding synth line on the 303 which threatens to drown all the prettiness of the piano with glitches and bursts of distortion. It builds up and then suddenly breaks back down to another, two chord piano riff and a first appearance of my much-maligned melodica before building up again in a long instrumental passage. I thought it sounded great, probably my second favourite thing we've done in the last few months (after Easy To Leave) and I can't wait to get back to it. So that was good.  Later that day I finally dispensed with my much-and-totally-fairly-maligned computer, thank god.  urlLink Andrew  has just bought a new G5 so he donated his previous Mac to me; am more excited than I should be. iTunes, in particular, is an incentive to sit listening to music all day and night. Hmm - perhaps an incentive I can do without. Nevertheless, it's fab.   Went to The Juggler on Western Rd on Sunday and noticed that everyone had a fashionable t-shirt on except me. Then I remembered I had one on myself (under my jumper), and felt much better subsequently.

      sporadic pos(t)er though I am, a couple of blogs have caught my eye recently.  urlLink Blissblog  is maintained by Simon Reynolds, who used to write for the Melody Maker when - for a few years in the early 90s - it combined great music with great writing in a way that's increasingly rare. Reading Blissblog is quite similar to reading MM actually - there's that same feeling that you've stumbled across something rare and exclusive which, if you work at, you might be permitted to share in. It's the opposite philosophy of the modern NME, which editor Conor McNicholas speaks of now as a  urlLink "club [which is] a hell of a lot easier to join" . That's as maybe, but the quality of the journalism is shocking. Blissblog covers 8step and  urlLink Dizzee Rascal  in depth, but the last few week's postings find plenty of opportunities to mention the residents,  urlLink bleep'n'bass , the byrds, jungle and an intriguing debate about London as the UK's centre of musical innovation.   One blogger who hasn't said anything in the last couple of weeks when half the web has been alight with gossip about the seven players rumoured to be at the centre of the rather horrific rape case in the news, is the author of  urlLink footblog . Hardly surprising. He is, apparently, a player in a top English team intent, like the wonderful  urlLink Aki Riihilahti , on demystifying the world of English football. I've got no idea if this is for real, but it's compelling reading regardless. Whether he will address the behaviour of his fellow (cough, cough) professionals, I don't know.   And although everyone seems to know the names of those (apparently) involved, it's hard to see anything but harm coming out of their (surely inevitable) unmasking - another prejudiced trial, though with DNA tests involved this should be a bit less cut and dry. The players involved should be sacked from their clubs if it's proven and their registration's held so they can't pick up their career elsewhere. It'll be interesting to see how ITV deals with the matches involving their teams on Saturday - there's bound to be uproar from the crowd if the players are picked, and if there are chants or banners then ITV risk a libel case themselves. I suppose they will have to edit the sound. Anyway.

      Went to see  urlLink British Sea Power  and  urlLink the Tenderfoot  last night with Vic, Pete, Anne-So and Sam. The Old Market in Hove is a nice venue; somehow reminiscent of a school hall, but with a nice sound and a good atmosphere. The Tenderfoot sounded lovely; they're a very delicate band, very deliberate and precise with faint, pretty tunes and a good line in between-song banter. All the same, they lacked muscle; they reminded me of  urlLink Tindersticks , a group that never really took their sound anywhere, just down a blind alley - but all the same, you won't hear a better song this year than 'Still Holding My Stomach In'.   BSP, on the other hand, are all taut aggression and drama. Opening with footage from David Lean's 'Great Expectations' and playing an album-heavy set to a lively reception, they were good but short of convincing; the odd song - Lately, and Carrion, particularly - sounded superb, and welded the two extremes of their style (early 80s gloom-rock and sub-N.O.U chaos) well; at other times they were self-indulgent and dull. When I last saw them I didn't know any of the songs and they seemed bright and chaotic - seeing them playing the songs I now know I felt disappointed that they weren't as eccentric as I first thought.   Towards the end of Lately, however, when they dispensed with caution and launched themselves up a gear, they mimicked  urlLink Pavement's  glorious 'Filmore Jive' so accurately that they were briefly transformed. And - conversely - at one point during the flabby encore the singer's 'It's time to get some sleep' refrain echoed the same song's gorgeous 'I need to sleep - why won't you let me?'. But by that point they'd been playing the same two songs relentlessly for the best part of an hour, and it was a question I felt like asking too.  But there's something about them that is endearing; maybe just the fact that they are doing something different, and as a visual spectacle they're still brilliant. It was a good evening - Vic even bought me a t-shirt, which is really nice. It says 'Bravery Already Exists'. Hmm. I suppose it's fairly brave to play a 15 minute instrumental coda at the end of your encore...

      Thursday's gig at the Pavilion Tavern went well. We were beset by technical problems, unfortunately - we couldn't get the 303 working so we had to drop 'Engines and Anvils', and the first couple of songs were affected by Pete's guitar amp cutting out, which was a bit of a shock at the time, but we kind of got on with it without too many problems. The set seemed to lag a bit in the middle so we skipped 'A Century too'. I don't know, for some reason I felt I was missing confidence this time; but all the same - I think we were good, and people were very nice afterwards. The set was  1. Get Away 2. You Should Know 3. Easy to Leave 4. John Wyndham 5. Vine to Vine 6. It's Alright 7. Freaks  And, on a couple of occasions (Easy to Leave, Vine to Vine and Freaks) I thought we sounded really great; but we need to do more gigs, I think - the other bands, Everything Crash and Feline Dream had much more in the way of self-assurance than us. Nevertheless, some things we did on Thursday we did better than ever before. It was great having the keyboards, great playing Easy to Leave, and I thought I perhaps came across better; I tried to actually talk to the audience every now and again, and that helped. We gave away quite a few CDs too, and spoke to some lovely people afterwards. And got quite drunk :-)  Had a nice weekend afterwards; I had Friday off so I spent most of it playing bits of music, listening to Momus, Bedsit Bomber, Aesop Rock and Van Der Graaf Generator and looking forward to Vic coming home. We went to the pub on Saturday with Anne-So, Sam, Pete, Mark and one of Pete's old friends, and Sam (who had started earlier than the rest of us) fell asleep, meaning that we could poke him, insult him, pour beer down his nose etc without him minding, which was nice. Went back to theirs afterwards and drank revolting schnapps and watched 'The Daytrippers' and dozed. When we left, about twoish, Vic just hared away from the front door and ran down the street. I tried to follow, running up on the high grass verge, and tripped, doing a tremendous drunken semi-somersault. Pete says the last he saw I was lying on my back on the wet grass laughing. Left my glasses where I lay, too, but rescued them the next morning. Phew.  Hangover on Sunday, which meant painful visit to Waitrose with a sore head and later, Love Actually at the Odeon. I may be tempted to go into this in some detail later, but for now suffice it to say that, even to a seasoned champion of Notting Hill and About a Boy, it was the most transparently manipulative, cynical, misogynistic and offensive film I ever seen. Utterly stunningly bad. Ah well. Charles II, a bit later on the BBC, was fine, but I couldn't help thinking it was Freddie Mercury.  j

       urlLink "I gasp at the saddening and maddening facts about our wasteful and contradictory lives - that globally, $33bn (£18.45bn) is spent on makeup and perfume annually, whereas just $29bn a year would be required to eliminate hunger and provide clean water to all".

      Greg Dyke has just resigned, and the longer the day goes on the more the  urlLink Hutton Report  leaves a bad taste in my mouth - the  urlLink Independent  lead with 'Whitewash' today (see below) - and it seems unbelievable that the blame has been put so squarely at the foot of the BBC (incidentally, the ITV news last night was positively  gleeful ) and none at the government, who only 'subconsciously' influenced the dodgy dossier (this despite explicit emails from Campbell ordering that the wording be 'strengthened').  urlLink Jonathan Freedland  in the Guardian points out that the whole thing is reminiscent of Lord Denning's enquiry into the Profumo affair, which concluded at the time that "people of much eminence" were not capable of acting improperly. Now, of course, we know very different.

      In that awful  urlLink 'The Big Read'  thing that the BBC did recently The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy finished really high up. I found those books a bit annoying; like eating a big bag of sweets that you enjoy at first but soon notice they all taste the same. Still, it was funny in places, and it just made me laugh again when I read that they're making a  urlLink big budget film version  starring.... Martin Freeman (Tim from  urlLink the Office ) as Arthur Dent and.... Mos Def as Ford Prefect!  urlLink Mos Def!!!!  Well, if you're  sure  :-)   But make another album first, hey?  Just been reading the Guardian's Rumour Mill, and couldn't help liking the following:   "Kevin Pressman has rejected a move across the Steel City to Sheffield United, not because joining the city's other club is an obvious no-no, but because he can't be guaranteed first-team football at Bramall Lane. Neil Warnock should just dangle a pie on a fishing line over the stout stopper's house, then watch the fat man bite."

      Chris is off to urlLink  Australia  in a week!!! He came to spend the weekend with us and we had a nice time; lots of drinks and dinosaurs ( urlLink of the model variety ) and a chance to say bye. He'll be there a year, but he talked about staying; it's strange - both exciting and intimidating. We looked through some online photo albums put together by Vic's friend Vicky, which made Oz look wonderful. Here, meanwhile, we woke to a little snow this morning - that was nice. It's gone now, but the weather promises future freezing.  urlLink Don't trust Andrew's weather report, though .   Our rehearsal was more of a recording session on Sunday - no Andy or Pete so we concentrated on recording drum tracks for Engines and Anvils, Vine to Vine and It's Alright. I've been toying with shortening the latter track, but Ali attempted to dissuade me, and as he was holding a pair of drumsticks at the time, I relented. But the last version we recorded of that was a little sickly, timing-wise, so this one should be lots better. And when you stand in a room hearing nothing but drums you realise how much is going on there. I like bands who use drum machines, but I'm not sure if it isn't limiting. Talking of bands who use drum machines (and who are fab), we bumped into Sadie from  urlLink La Momo  at Monster afterwards - they just played at the Garage in London. Envious.  Saw James and Becky at the weekend - Becky has got a short term job in the audio library at the BBC! James is still at Drusillas, and can be seen looking  urlLink flame haired and responsible here . He's thinking of buying a stuffed bear from the Friday-Ad. Well, why not?

      Back to the gig, briefly... On after us, the Strings didn't do much for me; it was very professional, piano-led rock somewhere between Steely Dan and Starsailor, without the former's wit or the latter's yawning earnestness. Their songs were OK and they went down quite well.  urlLink Girlinky  were much more my kind of thing, and played a snappy, seething set which easily topped their performance at the Pressure Point last year. By this time we'd most of us repaired to the bar and were feeling pleased with ourselves and a bit triumphant. Playing in London feels very different to Brighton, but perhaps that is just playing-outside-yr-home-town syndrome. Either way, we were surprised and pleased with the way it went, delighted to see everyone and keen to play again soon. We're going to try to get some demos recorded next, time permitting, and then hopefully work on some new songs; I've got a couple I'm keen to try and we can start to use the keyboards a bit more creatively now that we're using Reason.   In the meantime, I've been talking to Andrew a lot about how his project,  urlLink The Bedsit Bomber , is going to progress into doing some live performances. Thus far he's been hamstrung by using just his computer and the ubiquitous Reason, neither of which really lend themselves to spontaneous performance. But he's just bought himself a  urlLink Yamaha AN200 , which is a very cool desktop analog-modelling synth; and should mean that playing 'live' is now possible. All the same, the many complications of MIDI and the logistics of setting up a stage show is befuddling both of us. Either way, his recent songs are excellent, so when he does play live it'll be a treat. We spent a bit of time before Xmas putting together a collaborative set of tracks which we never finalised, provisionally entitled  urlLink 'Hedgehog Ash / That Got Twisted Out of Reach' , so now that he's working on his live set I might try to get my side of that EP completed, and we'll make it available when we're done. Not holding my breath for an immediate turnaround though - busy.  Went to see the urbane and prickly  urlLink Will Self  read from his new novella ( urlLink Dr Mukti ) last night, and really enjoyed it. Not so much the reading itself (though it was good) as the question and answer session afterwards. Asking him questions was a bit like offering to go in goal while Alan Shearer takes penalties, or firing gentle lobs up for Andre Agassi to smash past you. Some of the questions were bad ("why don't you like piercings?"), some were good (the man who talked about his sense of sadness about his children not reading), some predictable ("Which writers inspired you?") and some were bizarre (the German woman who asked about any of his 'indiscretions' with philosophy'). All were treated in much the same manner, as cues for him to spin a soliloquy out of, whether it concerned psychiatry, the boundaries between Brighton and Hove (which intersected his aunt and uncle's home when he was younger, and which prompted the jokes "shall we take the next course in Hove?", or "I think we shall have dessert in Brighton"), his love of words or strange, absurd riffs (one of which concerned his becoming upset by critics - which he says he isn't - and crying and crying onto his bed until the water filled the room, and then he would go for a swim, round and round, until he met a mouse, and then they would climb out to the bed, where they would hold a caucus... you get the picture). Like his books, his talks are triumphs of style; yet there is content there too; it's not just the way he says it, but what he says, too.

      I'll get on to describing the rest of the night in a bit, but in the meantime there's a fair and balanced (copyright Fox News) report of the evening's events on Andrew's excellent  urlLink Bedsit Bomber blog . I also noticed that he links to a report of the Southampton - Leeds game on Saturday. Reading through it the following sentence jumped out at me:  "Phillips then wasted a chance to make it 3-1, shooting himself as Ormerod was left waiting for a pass that never came."  Seems like the seven caps, no goals, has-he-got-a-moustache,-hasn't-he striker is being a bit hard on himself there :-)

      Saturday night's gig was our best so far, by a long way. We all met up at Brighton station at about 4 o'clock, lugging our instruments behind us (with not too much difficulty, actually - me and Pete bought light gig-bags last week, and AS's laptop and controller keyboard combo are incomparably easier to transport than her old synth) and feeling slightly apprehensive about playing outside Brighton. The venue itself was surprisingly central; bang next to the Palace Theatre and its endless cycle of Les Mis in Cambridge Circus; kind of the epicentre of the West End. And when we arrived, the downstairs bar, where the gig would take place, was full of late afternoon and early-evening drinkers, and not ready for us to soundcheck.   We went upstairs and had a pint, and were joined by others (aside from the band, Vic and Sam travelled with us, closely followed by Andrew, Mark and Emma from Brighton and lots of people from London - my cousin Jess and her friend Tristan, Martin and Ali, lots of Anne-So's work colleagues, Chris, Stuart and Shanida - neither of whom I'd seen for years - an unexpected and lovely Matt, and even Rob, I think someone said, whom I haven't seen for years and still didn't, as he left early, if indeed he was there).  People noted before the soundcheck that I looked nervous, but I wasn't at all - just impatient to do the soundcheck; in the past I've always felt completely calm after that; but beforehand full of kind of unfocused energy. I want to get going. By the time we did soundcheck, the venue was filling up and - frankly - I was in a bit of a flap. Soundchecking in front of people is odd, not least because you can't get it out of your head that they'll be sitting there thinking 'this is the real thing', not realising that it's not deliberate the way the mics don't work, or the songs cut mysteriously mid-song. Connecting up the laptop was a bit difficult at first, but we got there OK, and it sounded lovely through the PA. By the time we'd half done a couple of songs and got the better of the set-up, we had about twenty minutes 'til we went on.  By this time the place was disconcertingly full, and people started saying things about punters being turned away. The main section in front of the stage was full of milling customers and the bar was busy too. The sheer number of people meant that first-band-on-trauma-no.-1 (audience standing so far back from the stage that they are mere glints in the distance) was necessarily avoided. We started with  It's Alright  and I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. Not then - now, I mean.  I think I got the opening chords right - the solo went alright - it all seemed to be going alright. We waited for it to fall apart; it didn't. In fact, it went really really well - and it just kept on going well.  You Should Know  was great; by this time I had settled in and started picking out people in the crowd, and noticing that people really seemed to be enjoying it. The sound on stage was excellent for once, although Andy later said he couldn't hear much bass (although I could, standing a bit further ahead of him), and - buoyed - I found myself moving about unselfconsciously (perhaps for the first time), although the suspicion hangs that I just bobbed up and down like one of those sad, mad polar bears in London Zoo.  Sorry, unpleasant imagery, not quite sure where that came from.  The song closed to cheers, clapping, people enjoying themselves. We went into  Easy to Leave  and started to hit our stride, although I felt my voice wobbling on the held notes; ah well. The song has a groovy buoyancy. I got to the ending and missed a few notes on the outro. Ha ha.  No-one Need Ever Know  came next, sounding kinda full and breezy - we sound like a band. Pete's guitar cuts out a bit and I play the verse right through the chorus.  Hurrah  - no one seems to notice! It doesn't matter.  Vine to Vine  is the best song yet - AS on lead vocals, me out on the side and singing along so loud I suspect I'm just about audible off-mic. By the time we get to the end we're getting a really good reception and I'm really hot, really full of energy, really enjoying myself. And excited at the fact that we've saved the best song to last.  Engines and Anvils  sounds incredible, Andy's 303 and Pete's guitar swirling around the room; it sounds vicious. Now I'm suffering from serious delusions of grandeur and milking the applause at the end. Oh dear - I'm  sure I look like a fool . A happy one, though.  I get drunk.

       urlLink Very surprised to see this . I'm not a fan of the Prodigy, at least, not since a few songs off the first album, but I'm intrigued by this; apparently Liam Howlett has written and recorded the new Prodigy album almost entirely using Reason - it's interesting to hear that it's use extends into the professional side of music production. I look forward to hearing his new stuff, in that case.

      A good rehearsal on Sunday. Having struggled with the weight of  urlLink Anne-Sophie's keyboard  (not to mention its cheerful prediliction for adding echo to everything) we went out on Saturday and weighed up options for replacing it. There are some beautiful synthesisers out there - the  urlLink Novation K Station , the  urlLink MicroKorg  - but they were all dear and short on octaves. Thinking about it, we wondered if it wasn't possible to just use a laptop,  urlLink Reason  (a remarkable software studio much loved by me and the  urlLink Bedsit Blogger  - sorry - Bomber) and a Midi keyboard. We repaired back to my place and loaded it up on AS's laptop and found - to our surprise - that it works very well, with no discernible latency issues at all. So - after an initial crisis of confidence - we used the new set up at the rehearsal and found that it was effective; the organ settings, in particular, are richer and more resonant than the ones we'd had to use previously. So AS went out yesterday and bought herself a keyboard - the Evolution MK-449c which, to my chagrin, includes knobs and sliders unlike mine (grrr) and looks, frankly, absolutely brilliant. And as of next Saturday... that's what we'll be using.     Set list for  urlLink Saturday : 1. It's Alright 2. You Should Know 3. Easy to Leave 4. No-one Need Ever Know 5. Vine to Vine 6. Engines and Anvils.

      A wee  urlLink piece on Wiley  , amongst others, in the  urlLink Guardian  today;   "Bow is England's equivalent of Harlem," announces producer and rapper Wylie ( agh - excruciating name error - j ) confidently. "Everything's coming out of there, Plaistow, all that area of east London. All the artists are there, we all feed off each other. We've networked and that's made it move."   He has a point. In the last year, some of Britain's most exciting music has emanated from the council estates of east London: a lurching, experimental sound pitched somewhere between garage, hip-hop and ragga. Dizzee Rascal is its most famous exponent, but the style is so new that no one has thought of a name for it. "No one really knows what it's called, but I call it eski beat - the eskimo sound," says Wiley, who appeared on Dizzee Rascal's Mercury prize-winning debut album, Boy in da Corner, and was part of the same garage collective, Roll Deep Crew. His records sound marginally less like the total breakdown of civilisation than those of Dizzee Rascal, but are equally innovative and thrilling, driven by spasmodic beats, orchestral flourishes and noisy bursts of electronics. "The garage people never liked it; they tried to push it to one side because they felt it was negative. Then the garage scene went a bit dead because they kicked us out of it, so we made our own scene."   Wiley's dissatisfaction with the waning garage scene is dealt with on What Do U Call It?, a track from his forthcoming debut album, which lists his grievances at some length, before testily concluding: "I don't give a monkey's." Today, however, he claims to have other things on his mind. His latest innovations include starting a clothing label and making tracks without any bass or beats, apparently influenced by the reggae his father played. "It works," he enthuses. "It fucked up the rave! The youth are open-minded; they're following what's being done. It's like a blueprint right now. A child who lives in Bow, on the same estate as Dizzee, they know that they can do it now, because they've seen him do it."

        Look here!  I've had 150 hits today from people looking up piranhas.  What's with you?  I mean, I like piranhas too, but...  What's happening!?  Is there a piranha epidemic that I've missed? I mean, don't get me wrong, you're very welcome, but I'm disturbed. If I knew how popular piranhas were I'd have written about them more. Well, before you shoot off there's another post at the top of my blog - with more piranha links - if you want to have a look:  urlLink click here  and then scroll down a wee bit. And feel free to say hi in the comments box below... Cheers. (Jonathan, 03/08/04)   ---original post---  Wow, this  urlLink article  points out that   "Experts say [the piranha's] reputation for attacking humans is exaggerated"   which is a pity, already. Yet they go on to say   "it is thought a shoal of the fish devoured up to 300 people when their boat capsized and sank near Obidos in Brazil in September 1981."   Now that's what I'm talking about! Fantastic stuff.  More on piranhas, my new favourite animal, here:   urlLink http://www.aquariumfish.net/catalog_pages/wild/piranhas.htm   urlLink http://www.extremescience.com/Piranha.htm     (And a later post on the subject is    urlLink  here  )  In case you didn't follow the first link, they  found a piranha in the Thames today . Hence my sudden and explicable excitement.  Moving house tomorrow, so have to get my broadband switched over. True to form, I found a couple of links which feature things I now want to download, pah.  urlLink El Mundo Perdido  is a great, Blissblog-esque weblog with plenty of good music stuff on it (Scissor Sisters, Liars and 8-bar all mentioned in the last couple of entries), and  urlLink Code Blue  posts her tracks of 2003 and makes me want to go back to Limewire all the more.

      An excellent article from Sunday's Observer Music Monthly. Helen Walsh on raving - kind of a literary companion to The Streets's 'Weak Become Heroes'....   urlLink The Observer | OMM | My first love   A woefully un-updated blog in the last few days, argh. We moved house on Saturday, trecking as ever from one end of Brighton to the other, with appreciated help from Pete, Mark and Andrew; the move itself was as swift and hassle-free as I've ever experienced, and Pete's van-packing was Tetris-like in its efficiency. The new flat is lovely, although it hadn't been cleaned, which was a bit disappointing - still, we had Monday and Tuesday off so we rolled up our sleeves and did a fairly major imposing-of-order, and it all looks great now; significantly smaller than our last place, which was positvely cavernous, but somehow better for it; snug and handsome. Living back in Kemptown means more incidental noise and more crazies; after the neighbours from hell experience in Seven Dials we're kinda edgy and cautious at the merest sign of intrusive volume. But so far it's all been isolated - the car alarm, the passing revellers, a bit of sound from the re-decorated and newly-awful Sidewinder. So no sign yet of persistant noisemakers, but we'll see. Actually, having said that, someone further down our road was playing Guns and Roses at 2.30 in the morning last night, which was outrageous, but I refuse to believe anyone could do that regularly and not get shot by his or her neighbours. Surely?

      Having got somewhere with searching for more information on  urlLink Pamela Hansford Johnson  a few days ago (having failed to turn up anything previously), I've been inspired by my participation in the work  urlLink Book Group  to seek out some more information on Robert Irwin, the other (mostly) out-of-print novelist whose writing fascinates me. Without much luck.  Here at work there's a group of about fifteen of us who meet up every month to discuss a book; yes, I know, rather a second-hand concept, and rather restricting reading books you wouldn't ordinarily read (but also quite surprising). But it's as good an excuse for a drink at lunchtime as I need. Anyway, I have to suggest a 'horror' novel tomorrow so I was casting about for something suitable ('...Confessions of a Justified Sinner?', erm... 'Jane Eyre'!?) and thought about suggesting Irwin's remarkable 'Satan Wants Me' - not really horror of course, but dark and satanic, as well as being hilarious and unconventional. Anyway, that got me thinking about what a wonderful writer he was, and that in turn reminded me of the occasion when I first heard of him.   I'm a complete hoarder - always keeping newspaper cuttings, leaflets, flyers, old cassettes, magazines etc - so it comes as no surprise that I once had in my possession a dog eared article about Robert Irwin which I lost long ago. I'd found it in a copy of something like The Times or The Telegraph on a tube train about six years ago, and it was basically a story about the journalist who, sometime in the mid 80s, had encountered a short novel by Irwin (at that point, even more than now, very much an un-celebrated writer) called 'The Mysteries of Algiers', which had amazed him. He, despite this, and like the rest of world, remained in a state of pretty much ignorance about the rest of Irwin's work, until he published the incredibly successful and absolutely wonderful 'Satan Wants Me'. So the book charted his re-discovery of the author. At the time, it inspired me to read Irwin so much that I sought out the new book (kind of Adrian Mole goes Satanic in the 1960s) and an earlier one, 'Exquisite Corpse', (which was set in the surrealist movement of the 30s) both of which I loved.   Since then, sightings of Robert Irwin have been few and far between, although, as one of the most celebrated scholars of Arabian art and Muslim thought he has come back into fashion post 9/11, in an academic sense, at least (he recently wrote a well received non-fiction study of the  urlLink Allhambra ). What I just  tried  to do was find that old article, or anything else I could - interviews, reviews, articles. Well, I found almost nothing. Still, Dedalus Books, his publisher, does at least have a  urlLink bibliography of his fiction  work on their  urlLink website , and looking at Amazon, they've some of his books second hand. So far I've resisted putting my hand in my pocket, but it may be just a matter of time.  Most bookshops stock  urlLink Satan Wants Me , however. There aren't many books I recommend more.

      Know your enemy. Actually, the author of  urlLink Conservative Commentary , a young, ahem, tory maintains one of the best political blogs I've come across, even if he makes me furious at every twist and turn. Still - his site is interesting and full of good links.   You'll notice I've been updating my links list, which is how I keep dredging up blogs at the moment. The ones on the left are all good; particularly  urlLink ...greyblog... , which is Chichester based, and which delves into blog radio a little,  urlLink no rock and roll fun , which is great for pop music news and links (it has a picture of The White Stripes in the top left corner, but don't let that put you off), and  urlLink linkmachinego , which is just lotsoflinkstointerestingstoriesalltightlyjumbledup.

      So, Danger Mouse (one half of DM and Jemini, whose 'Ghetto Pop Life' is, apparently, one of the better underground hip hop albums of recent years  urlLink -  I won't pretend I've heard it) has just had his new LP, 'The Grey Album' shelved because of legal threats from EMI. Why? Because the album marries the entire acapella version of Jay-Z's 'The Black Album' to DM's twisted, cut-up remix of The Beatles 'White Album'. Apparently every note is traceable back to the original LP, and I've just sought it out online and been listening to it. In short - it's absolute genius. It may be true that I'd sooner gnaw my own leg off than listen to the Beatles(s) version, but this is well worth the effort DM expended. There's some info on the LP  urlLink here , and if you hover your cursor around a bit you might just find a link to the album itself too.

"I honestly believe [God] wants people to celebrate their bodies, as long as you don't compromise your Christianity in the process," said the vigorous-thighed chanteuse. Absolutely, Ms Knowles. We're sure God herself is partial to the odd bit of spandex and groin-writhing from time to time.    Well, quite.

      Read Polly Toynbee on the  urlLink 60s: a time of liberation and enlightenment.  Excellent stuff.  In the meantime, it's heartening to see the Labour government putting forward a truly radical, revolutionary proposal - the concept of providing universal childcare is a staggering one, and the government intends to open schools from 8am to 6pm and charge a top-up fee for the service. Payments for the out of school hours provision would be means-tested, with affluent parents paying up to £80 a week while others would receive the service for free. A ministerial source apparently says   "This is one of our big ideas for the third term. Real legacy stuff. We are determined not to compromise on quality. Someone with a teaching qualification will be on hand all the time".   Teachers, perhaps understandably, are voicing concerns - yet if the government can make adequate provision we'd actually be witnessing that rarest of things -  urlLink a labour government acting like a labour government .  On the other hand....  urlLink Jack Straw didn't know either . Gosh, I really feel good about putting my trust in this people...

      Well,  urlLink this  looks rubbish, surely.  And yet I read on  urlLink MacMusic ....   Another suggestion, here in England there is a kit consisting of Logic Hit Kit (a baby version of Logic - but has 8 audio tracks, 8 virtual instrument tracks and as many MIDI as you want) a manual and a microphone (the mic is cheap...). It is published by a company called Dorling Kindersley (I don't know if it is availiable elsewhere) and sold from their site or from amazon.co.uk and costs 20 pounds sterling (about 30 USD). I have been using it, and for a light program, it is brilliant - but then I had Logic Platinum on OS9, but couldn't afford to upgrade it.   Hmm.

      Andrew has posted a new song,  urlLink 'Twinkle' , on his blog, and it's good enough to warrant a link, I think - for me it really gets going towards the end, with its almost MBV feedback style effects. Really good. I see that he's also downloaded Tracktion, which is exciting - looking forward to hearing how it goes. I won't post another tracktion link after this, because they're doubtless boring to everyone but me and A, but one  urlLink quote from the digitalprosound website  all but persuades me it's the way to go:   Tracktion features unlimited audio tracks, decent FX, and VST plugin capability. Tracktion also features huge icons pointing to input sources, output sources, FX, Volume, Panning, Metering, and a screaming loud helper/popup feature. (this can be disabled by clicking the Help button) Hovering the mouse over any aspect of the application immediately pops up not only a help file, but also tips and tricks related to that file.   Tracktion also is unique in that it supports MIDI files as well, ported to outputs whereever you'd like the audio to come from, be it a soft synth, sound card synth, or external device. While the MIDI functionality is basic, it's also Reason-ably complete. It's got ReWire® support for tools that can take advantage of it. For the price of the application this too is a huge yet welcome surprise.

      There's a persistant clanking noise outside and I can't concentrate. It sounds like a hammer being struck against a lampost. What is it??  Oh well. Another weekend over. Started packing for our house move this weekend, which - combined with associated chores - pretty much took up all our time. Still, there was always  urlLink 'Carry On Matron'  on the telly and the distinctly odd ' urlLink Adaptation ' on video, which starts off brilliantly, loses it's way with a boring sub-story and veers alarmingly into chaos as the script effects a clever joke towards the end. Nicholas Cage plays a script-writer struggling to adapt  urlLink an uneventful book  and writing himself (and a perhaps-fictitious brother who serves as a kind of successful doppelganger) into the story, eventually writing himself out of a hole by handing over the script to his conventional side, the side which satisfies with bombastic Hollywood cliches, not finely-wrought micro-dramas. So the film ends in the same way, complete chase scene and happy ending. It's a tremendously over-clever concept and one that doesn't work at all. I don't like a film that I have to sit and figure out afterwards (without Pete's pointing out, I would have missed the handing-over-the-reins element of the story entirely, to be honest), or at least, not this one. Ah well. At least  urlLink Carry On  avoided feints and twists, and was much the better for it :-)  I won't go into last night's telly consumption - this must be really boring, and I'm ashamed. Suffice it to say, you offer me clever-clever art films? I take  urlLink I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here . I can't explain.

      OK - an experiment that failed. I've just removed the comments boxes; ever since I added them I've had problems with a slow-loading page, which is really irritating, so I've removed them. Hopefully the site should be back to its zippy best now.  some bits and bobs; 1. Maybe I should try and lay off the politics for a bit. One last link though; Andrew picked up  urlLink the education baton  on his bedsit bomber blog. 2. Oh, and read this: the  urlLink introduction  to Vic and Andrew's dad's  urlLink new book . It looks excellent. 3. OK - that's it. Next up: a quick band update....  Recording the new demo is going along, albeit slowly - so far we've done all our drum tracks and a few guitar and bass parts, and had a fair bit of (familiar) trouble with the 303, which is crackling, hissing, delaying and generally behaving very immaturely. What we thought would be a simple recording of Engines turned out to be rather more complicated, and we had to call a temporary halt. For obvious reasons, we didn't get anywhere near the electronic version of Easy to Leave. So I've been programming it on Reason this week, again without much success. The limitation of a big software package like Reason is obvious when you try to get something specific going. It's hard to keep it simple. So my simple synth line is now crammed with compressors, flangers and distortion modules, all without it sounding the way I want it to. I need to spend a bit more time on it, or better, go back and start again!  In the meantime, trying to get new songs finalised for once we've got the demo done; you can download an early version of one of them  urlLink here .

      Before we all got so hot and bothered about Tony Blair being exonerated in the Hutton Enquiry, it was still the issue of tuition fees which was making us all angry.  urlLink Vic uncovered a good article in the Guardian , and I tried (and failed) to voice the argument for their introduction (although I remain far from convinced about it, and certainly oppose variable fees). Amongst all that, we had a conversation with Anne-So who pointed out the tiny fees which are paid in France, and which made us feel all the angrier about the situation here. This morning, however, I read in the Guardian that   urlLink  Le Monde's front page headline recently was "French Universities on Point of Collapse".  It reported that the Sorbonne now ranks 65th in world university tables. The reason is lack of money. European universities were once independent, arrogant, confident institutions with a wealth of income sources. Bit by bit, they became appendages of education ministries. As they ceased to be trainers of an elite the number of pupils entered increased but the salaries for professors and money for laboratories, books and kit got lower and lower. In both France and Germany, the percentage of GDP spent on universities is less than half that of the US. On Tuesday night, the Commons turned the key in the rusted-up lock of university finance. Britain is now in the van of EU nations in turning its university sector to the future.   In Time magazine, Michael Blumenthal writes   urlLink  The French system of higher education is broken to the core.  At the level of higher education at least, it seems to me high time for the old French revolutionary triumvirate of Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité to open its doors to a fourth sibling: Modernité.   Money may not buy us love, or even happiness, but it can go a long way toward buying things for which we have, as yet, no other currency. A culture that takes pride in its intellectual achievements also needs to create a university system it can be proud of. And — though it may sound unapologetically capitalistic to say so — there are times when even a certain crass Americanism has the ring of authority: you get what you pay for.   Where does that leaves us? We didn't vote for a Labour Party that would introduce tuition fees, and we probably won't forgive them for doing so. Yet are we prepared to contemplate commercial funding? Do we think we have the slightest chance of persuading the government to channel money from it's ridiculous and immoral war-mongering budget over to Higher Education? And why did we never have to pay before? Why now?  David Chaytor writes in the Guardian that we need to examine some of the slogans we use when we attempt to defend the notion of a free higher education system. First of all, we say that we don't want to encourage a two-tier education system. But, he points out,   urlLink  Since when did we have a single-tier university system?    From Oxford to Essex, from University to Polytechnic, there has always been a hierarchical structure in British higher education. And what of the claim that under the new system the working classes would not be able to afford to go to University?   The fact is, however, that when full-time undergraduate tuition was free, the proportion of working-class students in our universities was close to zero. The key factor in widening participation is not low cost, but appropriate entry qualifications. Ninety percent of students with at least two A-levels continue to university.   These points don't make the idea of a market-based University Education any more appealing. But they do point to some of the fictions which hover around the edges of the argument. Chaytor concludes, damningly, that    a university system financed wholly or largely out of general taxation can only ever be a system designed for an elite.   He goes on:   Those of us who were the first in a thousand generations have got to recognise that our privileges were paid for by those we left behind. If we want to see a university place for everyone able to benefit from it, the old ways must change. That's why the higher education bill is so important. Far from being a betrayal of everything that Neil Kinnock spoke about, the new policy is a necessary, logical and practical act of redistribution of educational opportunity that should be welcomed by all socialists.    Now, invoking the 's' word in order to get the labour party back on side is a tactic well practised by Tony Blair, so it comes as no surprise to find Chaytor doing the same. And I disagree; the new policy of the labour party promises nothing in the way of distributing education more fairly. Assuming we buy the notion that it is considered advantageous for us to be aiming for a higher education system which is accessible to all and which produces thousands more graduates every summer (and as socialists, if not graduates, we must), we then have to cope with the fall out. If my qualifications (2:1 in English Literature) were enough, in 1999, to get me a low-paid job in the Publishing industry (but not much more) then how far, in five years time, would those qualifications get a similar graduate who is now awash in a sea of other graduates. What will the starting salary be then? And if having a degree is no longer a safe route to a modestly paid (let alone well-paid) job, how does one justify putting these hundreds of thousands of adults into unmanageable debt. If I had taken student loans at University (and luckily I didn't have to because my parents supported me financially) I would only just be starting to pay them off now. And I'm 26. How old will the graduates of the future be before they hit that ceiling and begin a long climb out of debt (if they get out at all). The pitfalls are obvious. For all the talk of education being further distributed, at the end of the day the same people will feel able to go (those whose background can carry the financial burden) and the others will demur.  Yes, there are arguments that a shift towards  urlLink vocational degrees  would help many future graduates (and might have got me a better paid job by now), and in part I agree with this. But (the wonderfully named) Stephanie Merritt writes that   urlLink  perhaps the Government means that as many people as possible should have the opportunity to benefit from the experience of higher education regardless of the 'usefulness' of their degree , and all the qualities it encourages - self-motivation, independent thinking, the capacity for questioning and debate - which can only contribute positively to the wider society. If they really believed that further education had a value beyond enabling the individual concerned to make more money, they should have maintained the principle of free university education for those who show themselves to be motivated and able, because all the sophistries of their proposed bursary system will not override the fear of half a lifetime's debt in the minds of a great many young people.   All roads seem to point the same way - that there is no alternative, and that the solution is painful. Not so, of course. But until we learn in this country that we will never make progressive social change without changing the top rate of tax, we will grow to hate our governments, and rue our finances, all the more.

      Okay, so I'm going to collect together some of the links I've been visiting and try and do one post on Wiley Kat and Eski/Grime and leave it at that, as these links probably aren't of much interest to that many people. Nevertheless - counting down and we've only got 12 days 'til Wiley's  urlLink 'What do U Call it? ' is finally released. And the album,  urlLink 'Treddin' On Thin Ice'  follows it on the 25th April. There's an interesting interview with the man himself here.   urlLink Eski Beat: An interview with Wiley   Stayed up listening to  urlLink Femme Fatale  on  urlLink 1extra  last night, hoping she'd play some tracks from 'Treddin...', but she didn't get round to it (despite saying she would). Still, she did have Plasticman on, who was talking about the forthcoming 'Grime' compilation that him and Mark One are working on... on  urlLink Rephlex Records , which is just brilliant - the darker, dubstep side of 2step has definitely got as much in common with techno and the likes of photek as it does with UK garage.    .

Different people call it different things, depending on when they discovered it. In the 80's, maybe it was House, Techno and Electro. In the 90's it was UK-G, Drum and Bass, Breaks or whatever. Now there are so many terms for it that the journalists can?t pidgeon-hole it any more. This is a good thing - it's music. Moody music. Multifunctional, multifaceted music created by Humans with Brains, Hearts, Machines & Electricity. Music that?s great for dancing to in clubs, or submerging yourself within your headphones, your car, your home, wherever. It's instrumental dance music, but it's the perfect forum for the best MC's and vocalists. We at Rephlex call it Grime to publicise to the people at large, outside of the specialist world of it's producers. The purists might debate the name, but while they do that, crews around the globe are uniting in this strong & fresh dance movement. In this age of Information Technology, people are able to easily find real quality that they actually want, without being spoon-fed compromised product. Now, it is a time of change and the soundtrack is Grime"   There's an excellent blog-feature on the Grime/Rephlex interface here:   urlLink more on grime / rephlex   and an absolutely massive overview of grime in 2003 here:   urlLink skykicking grime review 2003   And finally, because I'm conscious that apart from Dizzee and Wiley not much of this stuff has hit the likes of radio 1, a quick guide to beginners, and I'm stopping right...   urlLink (what is grime?)   ...there.

      Can't tell you anything about this beyond what's already there, but Andrew passed on this link to the website of a Mr.  urlLink Matt Gunn , whose two MP3s are well worth a listen, if you like dark analogue electric stuff, like I do.  Elsewhere, should I buy the new David Byrne album?? Will have to try not to. Since we moved house my broadband has been disconnected, so, shocking though it may seem, all of a sudden I have to start thinking about  buying  music again. It's a funny old world. Been listening to lots of hip hop for the last few days, and really enjoying it. When I was about 19 I really chased after new releases and really kept up with US rap; now I doubt I could summon up the energy to get back into it. I'm certainly never putting myself through the pain of reading The Source again.  Jonathan's off-the-top-of-his-head hip hop top ten (not in order) 1. Big Punisher feat.

      An entertaining article about Squarepusher in the Guardian today, although one suspects you wouldn't want to be stuck in the pub with him.    urlLink "The number '0' will never be boring to me because in it I see the infinite, the string composed of the addition of all other numbers, stretching beyond sight in both directions"   Hmm. Still, I must get round to getting tickets to see him (performing with the London Sinfonietta as part of the ongoing warp-records/classical backslapping festivities. Still, music from Cage, Reich and - best of all - Varese, so I want to go. And SP himself, obviously.  Not much band activity at the moment, as Anne-Sophie and Sam are off snowboarding (yes, I know - the Nouveau Riche...) and Pete is acclimitising to life in his new flat up the road. Meanwhile, not much happening with me; my compulsive habit of reading the comment pages of the Guardian has been replaced by obsessive book reading over the last few weeks. Just read  1. The Honour's Board - by Pamela Hansford Johnson, which was excellent, although not her best: a story about a private school and the headmaster's impending retirement. 2. Tim Parks - Shear / Tim Parks - Goodness; both quietly brilliant, if not as grabbing as his recent stuff. They're both menacing and, in the latter case, riveting. 3. Maggie Gee - The White Family - my big discovery of late; not come across her before but excellent reviews of her new book, The Flood, persuaded me to read this 2002 novel. It's superb, a lively, involving tale of domestic trauma and racism. But fun. 4. P.G Wodehouse - Quick Service; only just started this one, but if you're feeling tired and not looking forward to work, then there's no-one better than Wodehouse to read on the train.   One book I've not read, and probably won't, is the (much promoted) story of Andrew Collins' (get this)  happy  childhood - " urlLink Where Did It All Go Right? Growing Up Normal In The 70s ". Nevertheless, it deserves a mention, if only because the tag-line in the advertising is  'They tucked him up, his mum and dad' . Genius :-)

      A good rehearsal on Sunday, if only because we finally got round to playing some new songs for a change, which was really nice. Pete was up in Oxford for the weekend and the stuff we still need to do for the demo can be done at home, so we thought we'd use the opportunity to play some new stuff - we dragged our melodic, indie-ish song without any lyrics from a few months ago back from the dead and played around it with it, and tried two of my new songs - Don't You and What it Means. Only the latter we did in any detail, but both sounded good.   For What it Means we started playing along to a pre-programmed tune on the laptop, but pretty much abandoned that once we had matched the sounds ourselves; it's got a fast, monotonous bassline which I thought may be better on keyboard, but it sounded pretty good with Andy playing it live, and everything else just seemed to form naturally around that. I played the little guitar riff and sang, alternately, while we get ourselves used to it, but think I'll probably use the Novation to play a synth line once we get Pete back. In the meantime, I wonder if I've invented a fairly rubbish vocal melody for this one? Hmm - I fear I have. Might have to work on it.  Don't You came out very different to how I imagined it. Ali had a good laugh at the crap drum beat I had programmed, and we tried to play along to the acoustic guitar line I'd programmed - Andy pointed out it sounded a bit 'folktronica', which was true, but I couldn't help feeling it lacked depth and pace. Only towards the end, when Andy and Ali played a bit more obtrusively, did it sound like it could go somewhere, but this soon gave way to their ritualistic and gleeful custom of rocking out to annoy me :-) Still, it could get somewhere, I think.   Lastly, we improvised a little tune around some synth stuff which Anne-Sophie had worked out; basically just a processed waveform with regular hiccups; we turned it into something quite dark and exciting, although I fear we only played it for five minutes and may have forgotten all by the next time we rehearse...

      Now that Easter has passed, we seem to be into Summer scheduling, which means tons of new programmes on the telly, and, unsurprisingly, half of them are reality shows; the children of   urlLink Wife Swap  ,   urlLink What Not to Wear  , and   urlLink Jamie's Kitchen.    Actually, the three I watched this week were exactly that. The worst,  Ten Years Younger , was a cruel antecedant of Trinny and Susannah's excellent appearance's programme. But where the emphasis in that programme is always on working with what we have, and proving that there are many many ways to make any body look good, despite what  Heat  magazine might tell us,  Ten Years Younger  began with the unpleasant idea: if you wanna look good, you're gonna have to work at it. And they don't mean go shopping with a list of 'fashion rules' in it. They mean botox, hair extensions, more make up than you see on a night out on West St (although not as much as the girl who runs the No. 5 stand in Boots by Churchill Square. Really. Go see). This week's participant (victim?) was a prison warder with a grade A nicotine habit.We had to guess how hold she was.   By weighting the survey with young kids who, frankly, wouldn't have a clue, they managed to get her average (perceived) age up to 51 (some youngsters had been squinting and saying '67?'). Both myself and Vic both said 45 immediately. She was 45. In order to get her looking 41 they gave her 60 botox injections. She would have smiled, but her face was set.  And where  Ten Years Younger  drew on  WNTW  for inspiration,  Jamie's Kitchen , the big reality hit of a couple of years ago, where Jamie Oliver had 12 weeks or something (these programs don't work without an arbitrary timescale, for some reason) to train 20 teenagers with no cooking experience to be chefs in a busy London kitchen, was clearly the main influence behind another, rather better show which just aired on C4.  Gordon Ramsay, who swears inventively and often, was up against the same challenge as Jamie, more or less, in this week's excellent   urlLink Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares  , except the know-nothing star had persuaded a misguided restauranter to call him 'head chef', and the restaurant itself, Bonapartes, was in Yorkshire. Cue much Northern stereotyping from Ramsay, who used to play in goal for Celtic and should know better, and lots of closeups of bald pensioners salivating over Gord's own Beef and Ale Pie.  Fun to watch though Ramsay was, the real star was the young 'head chef'. He was a genius. A comic genius, I mean. He began by indicating that he hoped to one day run three restaurants (London, Paris, New York, of course), then poisoned Ramsay with an off scallop, revealed he couldn't cook an omelette and finally that - despite it all - he couldn't cook a damn thing. Worse, nor he could he empty a fridge. The show seemed to segue seemlessly into another reality show,   urlLink How Clean Is Your Kitchen?  . His was not very clean at all. He was given every opportunity, and was, eventually, fired.   The reality show, when it is good, makes you really root for the participant, really hope he can pull it off.  Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares  was like an exquisitely plotted episode of  Poirot . Only at the end do you discover the murderer - and it was the chef all along! But we liked him!  Not any more. Twenty minutes in you're praying that he'll come up to scratch. After thirty you're grimly fascinated and neutral. With quarter of an hour left I was baying for his blood. What a cretin! Never one to pass up the opportunity to take something too seriously, he was protesting  urlLink that it was a stich up  by the time Thursday's Guardian went to press. Front page, too.   If the rest of the series is half as good as this week's episode, it will be perfect.  Almost as good again was last night's   urlLink Fairy Godfathers  . Ostensibly the child of  Wife Swap  and America's  Queer Eye For a Straight Eye , it was not only hilarious and touching but downright fascinating. Two (ahem) godfathers (for which read gay men) move in with two old-fashioned husbands and their wives move out. Before long the neandethal men are ironing, whisking their lovers away for romantic weekends, and look ten years younger (with no botox involved).   What made this week's debut episode so winning, however, was not so much the slow dawning in these men that they have turned their (ridiculously pretty, how did they manage that???) wives into doormats and slaves, but the genuine and tender relationship that developed between one of the 'godfathers' and his charge; a pleasingly hefty, affectionate but unreconstructed farmer. They fell in love, if only in a 'you're my new best friend' kind of way. Lovely.  Much lovelier than  Ten Years Younger , that's for sure.   There was another programme on earlier in the week and it was, in fact, better than all of the above. It was entitled  One Life , and in it an air hostess, Ros Pryer, met up with other people, children and adults, who were born with prominent birthmarks on their faces. Ros, who was in her mid 30s, had covered her face in camoflage make-up since her teens, and was terrified of being seen with her port wine colouring. Eventually she met a younger version of herself, a young mother, who persuaded her to go out without the warpaint. Had she seen  Ten Years Younger  the night before filming I bet she wouldn't have dared - it was a programme which insinuated that behind every smile was the utmost unkindness, and without extreme beauty - or a disguise - we were lost.

      Unfortunately, unlike  urlLink Gutterbreaks , I’ve not got an iPod, but I was much taken by his idea of putting his iPod on shuffle and seeing what it came up with. He talks of thinking increasingly of his record collection  ‘in a more modular way, rather than as a series of discreet blocks' , and, actually, since I started using iTunes I’ve started to think in a similar way. Because I’ve not got much space on my hard drive lots of the albums I originally ripped have had inferior songs snipped out over the last couple of months, as I prune the selection to free up space for new music. It’s actually a totally different approach to storing music, akin to collating the biggest compilation in the world, perhaps, as opposed to the most extensive collection, which was, I suppose, my former (and totally unrealistic) approach. Now, I dunno if I could apply this method to storing my music collection if I didn’t have the security of having all my Blur and XTC albums lined up on shelves next door, but it’s an interesting idea. Anyway, leaving my iTunes on shuffle this morning produced the following collection…   1. Tony Allen feat. Damon Albarn and Ty – Every Season 2. Tom Tom Club – Wordy Rappinghood 3. Braintax - Acapello 4. Wu Tang Clan – As High as Wu Tang Gets 5. Brian Eno – Golden Hours 6. Dave Clarke – Way of Life 7. Joy Division – These Days 8. Fischerspooner – Emerge (DFA remix) 9. Bedsit Bomber – Newbuild 2 10. Girlinky – Newspaper Round 11. T. Raumshmiere – The Game is Not Over 12. Scissor Sisters – Take Your Mama Out 13. British Sea Power - Apologies to Insect Life 14. Damon Albarn – American Welfare Poem 15. Einsturzende Neubauten - Sensucht 16. Wiley – Happens for A Reason 17. Luke Vibert - Slowfast 18. Andre 3000 – God (Interlude) 19. Lou Harrison - Piano Concerto (II. Stampede) 20. Andre 3000 – The Love Below (Intro) 21. John Cage - Quodlibet 22. The Fiery Furnaces - Winter 23. Pharrel feat. Jay-Z – Frontin’ 24. Over Sea Under Stone – My Prayer 25. The Raincoats – Adventures Close To Home 26. Meredith Monk - Panis et Ciceres 27. Miss Kittin – Berlin is Burning (vocal outro) 28. Kraftwerk – Electro Cardiogramm 29. Blur – Don’t Bomb When You’re the Bomb 30. SL2 – On a Ragga Tip

      Sometimes it’s difficult, when you live in one flat in a large building, to feel as if you live in anything other than your own three rooms, approached via a corridor and a couple of flights of stairs. We told ourselves that when we moved into our current flat we would make a point of introducing ourselves to our neighbours and not just live as anonymous flat-dwellers. But we fell into the usual trap and didn’t approach anyone – especially silly as, in fact, we used to live in the basement flat of the same building a few years ago and our old landlady, who we really like, still lives down there. Consequently when we eventually bump into her and explain we’re living too floors up, it will be an absurd moment.   The last few days, though, I seem to have come into lots of contact with our neighbours, or rather become conscious that there is more to the building than just us. In actual fact, apart from our experience in Seven Dials, where we were hounded by the loud music of our neighbours, this is probably the first time I’ve felt this.  Not that I’ve been doing lots of socialising with the other people in the building, mind – just that lots of little events have occurred which, joined up, add up to something, much as the 10 flats in our building must, naturally, add up to a house.  The other evening someone rang our doorbell / intercom thing. I answered it, and was met by a man demanding, rather aggressively, to speak to ‘Elisa’. I explained there was no-one there by that name, but he didn’t seem convinced, and I had to repeat myself. Then, the day before yesterday, as I was leaving for work in the morning I got to the top of the road and heard someone call “Hey” out to me. As I turned round I saw a man getting out of a nearby car and, in a familiar voice, ask me to hang on, as I was already walking on, it not being my practice to get into conversations in the street. When I did turn around, I imagined that I would be asked for directions somewhere, or at most for a cigarette or something. But the man again, asked, quite urgently, “Where is Elisa?”. He had obviously been waiting in the car for someone to leave the house. Obviously, I told him that I didn’t know of any Elisa. “But you live in that house”, he said. “Yes, but I don’t really know the neighbours, or if there is anyone of that name living there”. Thinking him a bit menacing, I continued, “As far as I know – there  isn’t ”. He looked pissed off and returned to his car.  Last night, bringing back memories of our last flat, we had quite a lot of loud music, overhead. I had rented out the film  Together  and we were trying and failing to watch it, becoming distracted by the sounds. The couple above us are not that noisy, although they always play music on Tuesday nights, and once had a fairly raucous dinner party on a Sunday night which kept us awake. However, we had observed them going up and down the stairs and their appearance seemed to explain why they had been so animated that night. It was the evening when the Greek election results were announced, and they had obviously stayed up late to watch the results coming in. We heard much stamping of feet and the kind of rumbling chatter which you know must be in a foreign language. Their appearance, besides betraying their Southern European background, also helped explain the fact that we would often hear them thumping about upstairs – we called them ‘The Elephants’.  After sitting through the music for ten minutes or so, we decided to go up and ask them to turn it down a bit - something which would of course, have been much easier if we had introduced ourselves to them when we first moved in. But doing that would, it turns out, have done more than just that - it would have disabused us of an assumption or two. Because when we got to the top of the stairs and knocked on the door, a young man in his mid-twenties (playing, I could hear now, Jimi Hendrix) answered, saying "Oui?".   Why had we reached the conclusions we had about the people overhead? Obviously the Greek couple lived somewhere else in the building. All the mental images I had of the flat above us collapsed. It was strange. The guy turned the music down immediately, of course, and we returned to the flat to wonder how we had so successfully rationalised so much of what we had - frankly -  guessed at  since we had moved in. The Greek elections? Now I think about it, the 'Greek' couple don't look  that  Greek - only slightly Mediterranean; their 'Greekness' only followed from the knowledge that the Greek elections were being held the day they had a party. How easy it is to make assumptions! Anyway - the chap who does live above us seemed nice.  When I left for work yesterday morning, I was relieved to see that the man in the car was nowhere to be seen. Nor, however, was my bus, and standing at the stop at the top of our road waiting for the 7 I noticed out of the corner of my eye, suddenly, someone I recognised. It was, of course, our former landlady, Teresa. If she saw me she reacted the same way I did; it was too late. I find meeting people unexpectedly quite alarming, usually (as does Vic, who looked away when a friend waved at her the other day. The next day she said, cheerfully, 'sorry for blanking you', which I thought was funny - I'd have made an excuse), and both myself and Teresa did that hesitate, look of confusion, look away thing. In actual fact, nine times out of ten you're level or beyond the person before you completely recognise them, I find. Well, it was a bit embarrassing. But perhaps she didn't see me at all, I don't know.  Even if we desire to live in isolation, it really isn't possible. But I can't think why we would. Living surrounded by other people means you're opened up to plenty of situations beyond your control (and the emotions I described above are hardly sanguine - embarrassment, concern, irritation, confusion) but it also means you're in some way connected, and in some sense that is calming, even if the stereo above is blaring. I feel better about living where I do after the last few days; like the house just became an organic thing. In the Geoff Dyer book I just read, he spends some time in Rome and visits the Colosseum - while on acid - and writes,   "The exhaust-smeared stones pulsed and rippled with life, warm and vital as a stroked animal. For a few minutes, anything seemed possible. I was within reach of the stillness at the centre of the stone."

      I was reading some of the  urlLink customer reviews  of 'Boy in the Corner' on Amazon.com earlier - interesting that for most US listeners they posit his sound squarely as hip hop - presumably because garage in the US means Todd Edwards and 4/4. I've always thought Diz's record is reminiscent of early Public Enemy, with all the sirens and the clatter, and there's obviously a big electro influence. And if you stripped the vocals off 'I Luv U' you'd have something which could comfortably sit on a more esoteric Warp release. And now, obviously, Rephlex are about to release  urlLink 'Grime' , which collects together stuff by Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob, and persues the dubstep/breaks side of the grimey scene. Now, K-Punk calls the  urlLink Forward>>  stuff 'Croydon Techno' (more on this,  urlLink here ), and now Gutterbreaks spends a bit of time looking at the  urlLink links between Eski beat and Techno . He writes:   "I've always been a fairweather Garage listener, merely dipping my toes in occasionally but never committing any allegiance. A lot of it leaves me cold, especially when it gets a bit too 'urban', but prior to the imminent release of Wiley's long-player I'd just like to say a few words on the subject of Eskibeat. I bought the new single "Wot Do U Call It", but other than that all I'd heard previously were various MP3's. I like the instrumentals best. Tracks like "Freeze","Blizzard" and especially "Icepole" are definitely on my wavelength. To me, Wiley should be viewed outside the confines of UKG/Grime, as the latest visionary in a long line of electronic innovators within dance music. I hear echoes of Richard H. Kirk's early-nineties electro experiments like "C.C.E.P." (as Sweet Exorcist, with Parrot) and "The Mood Set" (as Xon, with Robert Gordon). I would also put forward the idea that Wiley is Britain's answer to Juan Atkins. I always felt that Atkin's sound was colder than that of other Detroit artists; soulful but with a dagger of ice through it's heart. He developed a new sound, 'Techno', from the ruins of a previous genre, 'Electro', just as Wiley has created his Eski mutant from the ashes of Garage. And it took one of Juan's disciples, Derrick May, to 'break' his sound to a wider audience, much the same way that Wiley's protege Dizzie Rascal broke into the mainstream first. "Wot Do U Call It" is as potent a statement of intent as Model 500 classics like "Off To Battle" or "Techno Music".    Anyway, another list: ....liking:  1. Wiley - Treddin' On Thin Ice (better than I thought it would be!) 2. Michael Mayer - Fabric 13 (excellent and odd Germanic tech-house) 3. Graham Coxon - Bittersweet Bundle of Misery / Morrisey - Irish Blood, English Heart (new singles!) 4. James Lavelle - Romania (seems to have escaped the instro hip hop rut now) 5. Ellen Allien - Live at May Day 2003 (a barnstorming electro set - her album Berlinette is ace too)

We should also have our new demo completed by then, so if anyone wants a copy they only have to shout 'Jonathan! Give!', and I shall.

      Although old-fashioned, fisherman's pubs are one of the main reasons why  urlLink Aldeburgh  has such charm, one of the pubs we frequented a couple of years ago when we visited (admittedly, not the nicest pub there) had undergone a bit of a revamp. Now styled as a 'bar and grill', what used to be The Victoria is the largest pub in town and, on a Thursday night where only one of the town's several restaurants was not fully booked, the emptiest, too. As for the grill, they seemed to have given up.   Aldeburgh is, incidentally, being just around the corner from Southwold, very much part of  urlLink Adnams  country. Due to a strange combination of events, and our tiredness post dinner, we never quite got a chance to sample a pint. Had we decided to do so, any pub would have served it, except for the Bar and Grill, which served an unimpressive mix (perhaps why it was so quiet). When we went (late afternoon, attracted by the sun and seats outside where we could read our books and watch the high street) we plumped for a  urlLink Hoegaarden  for Vic and a, ahem,  urlLink Carling Cold , for me, which I had not seen before. Basically Carling that's been in a freezer as opposed to a fridge. Buying them, the pub's sole other occupant (Vic was outside), a middle aged man drinking Guiness, addressed me in a posh, matey voice.  "Is that a wheat beer?", he asked, pointing at the Hoegaarden. "Yes, it is". I think it is. What's the difference between a wheat and a white beer? "It's very nice", although actually I don't like it, too thick. "Ah", he said, becoming a bit excited. I smiled and made to leave, but he kind of edged into my way. "You know what they say about [he named a beer, I can't remember which], don't you? The slogan?" "No". "That it is a beer for professors! Other drinks may be alright in their way, but this is a drink for professors! Isn't that good?". "Excellent". "Excellent!". He obviously wanted me to continue our conversation, but I made my way outside.  Striking up conversations with friendly strangers is the kind of thing I wish I did more often, but it's hard to know what to say. What had my neighbour at the bar seen in me? I imagine he saw a scruffy, posh-ish young man who might sit and discuss unusual beers with him. I'm probably like his son. But I know nothing about beer and talking to a stranger in a deserted pub is not as much fun as sitting outside in the sun. When we got back out there we sat contentedly, getting sunburnt. I was reading  urlLink The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time , by Mark Haddon, which is really good, and getting partially distracted by the sun, by the fact that the fellow sitting on the next table along looked like the  urlLink Aphex Twin , and by the next man along still, who knew everyone that passed. He had a voicebox. "Still croaking away?", one passer-by asked. He nodded happily.   A few more people did turn inside the pub as the afternoon stretched on, but the man I'd talked to inside didn't come back out.

      Did some work on new songs at the rehearsal last night -  Don't Ask Me  started out life as a demo I did on my keyboard, and was a (possibly misguided) attempt to sound like  urlLink Soul II Soul . Early versions of it with the band saw it taking a much heavier, guitary sound, with tribal, krautrock drumming, but, like the early versions of  Get Away , lacking structure. Last night we had another go at it, trying to differentiate between verses and bring out the chorus (it's the kind of song which relies on repetition and slightly shifting sounds, so - if we're not careful - it can end up sounding like soup). Eventually we hit on the idea of suddenly switching the drums in the chorus to a surprising, clear  urlLink disco  type beat, which worked really well, and finally the song is taking a bit of shape.   Another old one, which I've referred to before but never by name (because it hasn't got one), has existed as a fully fledged song for quite a while but lacked lyrics, so it never got anywhere. It's a pretty, melodic, indie-pop type number and writing a vocal melody has always been beyond me. But on the train yesterday I put our old MD recording of it on loop on my discman and had a go, and worked out a set of words and a melody that I was really pleased with. Having done so, I fretted about forgetting the tune, so ended up humming it in my head all day. When it came to playing it last night, my mind went completely blank and I forgot it. This morning, luckily, the tune popped back into my head. Anyway, I'd better give it a title now I've got some words, so I'll go for either  Advice  or, for singalongability value, the chorus's  I'm Shit .  Of the three other tracks we worked on, we spent the least time on an instrumental song that arose out of the lead break for  You Should Know  a few months ago. Rehearsing without me a few weeks ago the others had the idea of blending the short section we already had with the really good, and no longer played, intro to one of our very first songs,  Broken . It worked well, but we only really had one go at it. Still, it sounded good, and it's nice to have a faster number to play, too. Another one which we've worked on a little before,  What it Means , is taking shape, although it's fast, monotonous bassline is taking its toll on Andy's fingers. Despite appalling slurs from Pete (he said it was  melodic ), it's one with lots of potential I think.  The final new one we had a go at was one I wrote in the week on my computer, and, though fairly simple, sounds endearing enough at the moment - a choppy, new wavey verse and a big sounding chorus which, horribly, reminded us slightly of Stairway to Heaven. We only gave it a couple of goes but it seemed to work, especially the bassline. Andy said it reminded him a bit of The Clash, so he's my  friend for life .

      Victoria and I spent three days last week in the lovely seaside fishing village of Aldeburgh.  (lovely  urlLink picture of the town here )  If Aldeburgh is, indeed, in the middle of nowhere (and of course, it isn't really - the nearby town of Southwold is a popular destination and Ipswich itself is not so far away - but it feels like it to a city boy whose journey from Brighton to London, even, is peppered constantly with large towns and only the thinnest slices of countryside), it is at least noticably civilised. A polite way of saying we only heard two regional accents all the time we were there (in the Co-Op and the newsagent, oddly, rather than the neo-Hampstead minimalist furniture store). The journey, which was hardly direct, was a bit more colourful.  Obviously, if you drive you simply get in at Brighton, admire the scenery and roll in at the Cross Keys Inn, Aldeburgh, a couple of hours later, but by train the journey is much more complicated. We had to go from Brighton to East Croydon, then to London Bridge, then to Bank, then to Liverpool Street, then up to Ipswich, and on to Saxmundham, a small town about eight miles away from Aldeburgh.  As the photo above should show, Aldeburgh is a very pretty, unspoilt little town. A fishing village for hundreds of years, it was home to the poet  urlLink George Crabbe  and the composer  urlLink Benjamin Britten , whose opera  urlLink Peter Grimes  was inspired by the former. Like lots of villages in the area, Aldeburgh has had much of its land reclaimed by the sea in the last five hundred years (Slaughden, where Crabbe was born, is now entirely under water), losing 5 or 6 streets to the North Sea. The Mote House, which stands on the village's long and beautiful beach, was once at the town centre. There have been more recent changes too, if not architecturally. The village has become popular with well-to-do Londoners in seach of a rural retreat, with the unfortunate consequence that during the winter much of the town is empty and the shops closed down. But it's a fascinating place.  Saxmundham, on the other hand, a small market town with not an awful lot going for it bar a Somerfield Supermarket and a train station, bears all the hallmarks of  The League of Gentlemen . Well, possibly, I'm being cruel. But walking through the town on our way to the bus-stop (the last section of the journey, thankfully) we were comprehensively stared at and examined by all the locals, as if the heavy bags on our shoulders did not adequately explain that we were merely tourists passing through. The only people there who did not seem to notice our presence were the gang of kids skateboarding around by the bus shelter.   Everywhere teenage boys relish this carnival of failure, the endless, endless attempts to successfully master that manouvre from pavement to bench, or tarmac to curve. I had not a hundredth of that patience when I was a teenager - my skateboarding fad lasted less than a week. In Brighton at the tail end of last summer I asked Vic why she thought boys put themselves through it so much. Before she answered we noticed the gaggle of exceptionally pretty teenage girls coyly watching, and then I understood, maybe. But the boys in Saxmundham were only being watched by us, so I didn't understand it after all.  Perhaps it was the shortage of anything else to do except board the train to Ipswich (or the bus to Aldeburgh). All the shop windows were amazing, like the inverse version of Stephen King's  Needful Things  - all useless. One shop window carried a sign which asked for participants in the forthcoming series of  urlLink  Wife Swap  , an advert I have never seen anywhere else. So that's how they recruit their country bumpkins! Pity the poor metropolitan who ends up here with one of Saxmundham's gurning husbands. Another was full of sponge mini-footballs adorned with the flags of Europe and an obviously fake botched attempt at the Euro 2004 logo. Why had the proprieter taken on these monstrosities? Where had he bought them? We did not wonder that the boys played instead with skateboards.  Better and stranger than this was the shop window in Leisten, which we passed through on the bus (and which was, amazingly, even weirder) - the usual clutter of end-of-line products and tat and, sitting proudly in the middle, a large black  gollywog . There  is  a gollywog in  The League of Gentlemen , isn't there? I'm not imagining it?

      Saw a couple of wonderful films over Easter -  Harold and Maude , which is a kind of precurser and surely an influence on the films of Wes Anderson ( Rushmore  and, particularly,  The Royal Tenenbaums ) and which has a gorgeous soundtrack by (ahem) Cat Stevens. The other film,  Tatie Danielle , concerns an elderly French woman who goes to live with her nephew and his family and wreaks havoc. Imagine Principal Skinner's mother in The Simpsons and multiply by ten; a hilarious portrait of horridness. And enough cruelty to dogs in an hour and a half to traumatise even the most half-hearted of animal-lovers.   urlLink Harold & Maude Soundtrack by Cat Stevens | the songs used in the film

      Well, we tried to go and see the brill  urlLink La Momo  at the Freebutt on Saturday night but timed it wrong and ended up missing their set, so we went upstairs to the Penthouse for Miss Pain's  L'Amour Electronique  instead, which was not as good as it had been previously. By then we'd most of us drunk too much (wine and Alsacian beer over at Anne-So's and Sam, first, where we had a barbecue on the balcony and burnt two great holes into the floor. Erk). And the club thing dashed by fairly fuzzily - it was the kind of club night where no-one could muster up much enthusiasm for the proceedings, so we pushed ourselves along by making paper aeroplanes, those fold-down pictures where everyone takes a body part (my robot torso I liked, incidentally) and draws it (with horrific results). I snapped a circuit board in half which was a bit dumb.  urlLink Miss Pain  tried to look cheerful but they looked all dressed up with nowhere to go.

      Ah, back in several senses of the word. Back home after three days away over Easter, back online at home after 6 weeks offline without any internet access, and (shortly) back at work. Well, tomorrow. Also, of course, back to my blog, which has been neglected and gathering dust over the Easter week as I've not had the chance to post to it. Well, here I am.  Just reading some of Bruce Dyer's (so far) excellent  Yoga For People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It , and very taken by the following:   We'd never seen anything so green as those rice paddies. It was not just the paddies themselves: the surrounding vegetation - foliage so dense the trees lost track of whose leaves were whose - was a rainbow coalition of one colour:green. There was an infinity of greens, rendered all the greener by splashes of red hibiscus and the herons floating past, so white and big it seemed as if sheets hung out to dry had suddenly taken wing. All other colours - even purple and black - were shades of green. Greeness, here, was less a colour than a colonising impulse. Everything was either already green - like a snake, bright as a blade of grass, sidling across the footpath - or in the process of becoming so. Statues of the Buddha were mossy, furred with green. Stone had become plant, the inanimate had become organic. 'Annihilating all that's made / To a green thought in a green shade'? No, even thought had been annihilated. This was an entirely sensual green, one that rendered thought not just impossible but inconceivable.

       "BLUR are heading back into the studio next week to record a new EP. The news will come as a blow to the sceptics who predicted 'Think Tank' would be the band's last record.  Damon Albarn has revealed that he is currently juggling three different projects: the Blur EP, an album he's set to record in Nigeria with the surviving members of Fela Kuti's band and a new Gorillaz record. He also said he would like Graham Coxon to rejoin the band. 'Blur's like a family with one brother no-one talks to,' he told 6 Music, adding: 'It is a realistic prospect - the only reason he's not in the band is because he didn't feel he was getting enough say. We're totally capable of making music together. I can forget about all the other things.'   A number of songs from 'Democrazy' - the album of half-finished tracks he recorded on the road in America - will find their way into these projects. 'The song actually called 'Democrazy' has evolved into a fantastic song with Tony [Allen] (producer). A couple of them have gone to nearly-polished Gorillaz pop gems now, and I'm doing an EP with Blur and a couple will go there,' he said. The Blur EP is likely to be the first of these to be completed. The band are due to go into the studio with 'Think Tank' producer Ben Hillier next week to record them.  As for Gorillaz, Albarn revealed that he is planning to use The Bees as the house band for the new set of songs, and he also has another high-profile collaboration lined up. He revealed: "I've been working with Dangermouse. It's gonna be great. Gorillaz is just pure unadulterated pop fun for me," he added. The Nigerian collaboration will see him fly out to Africa later this month to work in Fela Kuti's studio with Tony Allen and other members of the pioneering Afro-beat band. "They're all my songs and I'm singing, so there will be focus on me, but we'll have a name that isn't my name. I don't believe in the idea of a solo record. I'm looking for a country guitarist at the moment. There's gonna be a lot of slide guitar - sort of Afro-country," he said.  But Albarn's ambitions do not stop there. "After I've done these records I'm going to take a long time out, possibly to work in theatre for a few years," he divulged.   Thanks,  urlLink NME .  Having said that, is it just me or is the NME's journalism hurtling downhill at a rate of knots. I found that article really hard to read. I had to heavily edit the paragraphs to get a readable version, and even that only just does the trick.

      Something that's odd about the music downloading debate is that it's forced record labels into the odd burst of conciliatory language. Not in the sense that they consider file sharers to be anything other than criminals, but they have come out with the odd comment to the effect that they understand that essentially you 'can't compete with free' and have talked about a downloading climate which reflects better value for money - if not better than the file sharers can offer, then at least better than the rip-off prices and poor quality service they've been running for years. The more optimistic amongst us imagined a climate where artists began to be disinclined to fill albums with fillers, where the customer can pick and choose and discover, inexpensively, new artists. The lovely  urlLink Bleep  from the even lovelier  urlLink Warp  offers just this. On Bleep downloadable albums cost an average of 7 quid - significantly cheaper than the CD counterpart. But as for the good intentions of the rest of the music industry? Unsurprisingly, it's a sham.   Andrew mails to tell me that  "The Wall Street Journal carries a story today on the higher prices customers are starting to face from online music stores. Apple, for example, is charging $17 for N.E.R.D.'s new 12-track Fly or Die album, while Napster charges $14--both higher than the $13.50 Amazon is selling the physical CD for. All five major record labels are also reportedly discussing ways to raise the price of single downloads, from increasing the price anywhere from $1.25 to $2.50, to bundling hot singles with less desirable tracks or charging more for singles of tracks that have not yet been released in stores"   Ho hum.

      We came within a hair’s breadth of finishing the demo last night – in fact we finished it in a way, in that we completed the vocals and used up the last available tracks on the recording. But we decided that we want to free up another track so that we can add backing vocals, which means another couple of weeks before we get it finished (which, might, actually, give us time to resurrect  Engines and Anvils , too).  It’s actually been well over a year since  urlLink Assistant  rehearsed in the evening: our Saturday morning slot gave way to a Sunday morning one and it’s only now that we’ve returned to practising in the evenings. So I also saw Monster (where we rehearse) at night for the first time. It’s on a mini industrial estate (sorry, Enterprise Centre) by Hove Lagoon (behind the posh, beachfront row of houses where slebs such as Norman Cook, Zoe Ball and Nick Berry live), and approaching it at night is a totally different experience. Beside the row of units which contains Monster (and also 'The Cheese Man') there is parked (no, moored, for the estate sits beside the canal which runs past Portslade and opens out at the eastern arm of Shoreham Harbour) a huge ship,  The Sand Weaver , which looks somehow extremely sinister at night. Its regular appearances at the harbour coincide, Ali says, with periods of good and bad business at Monster, though whether the studio is busy when it is there and quiet when it is not, or the other way around, I'm afraid I can't remember. Anyway. One consequence of rehearsing at night once more (we're doing 9-11ish), is the welcome return of alcohol at rehearsals. Tempting though it was, a can of beer when you're playing at 11am always felt just a little too much. Other, hardier bands will doubtless scoff.  In order to record vocals properly, we have to sing through a kind of shield thing to stop the popping noises you get otherwise; in our case, through what looks like a home-made fishing net. On closer inspection, it's a microphone stand with a pair of tights stretched across a hoop. Andrew Loog Oldham doubtless prepared a cocktail of exotic drugs to inspire the Rolling Stones to successful performances in the recording studio. We find that the tights do the job pretty effectively. The only down side of course, is that you have your face pressed up against a pair of tights on a metal pole for the best part of two hours, and can't see anything much else. Still, perhaps it focuses the mind.  We recorded  Easy to Leave  first. It's probably the easiest song for me to sing, so a good one to start with. When I started singing I felt like I was in pretty good voice, considering the fact that my voice is probably only middling at best (although a friend of Sam's, Tory Tim, said that I sound like a 'young Peter Gabriel'!!!), but it's funny how the voice loosens up and I probably sounded better later. Nevertheless, there are some songs which are so much fun to sing because the song gives you the space to do so. Our recording of the song is really wonderful, I think - a long way from my original demo, which sounded gentle and slight - and we've managed to really give it a proper chorus; I did the vocals quickly, until we tried to overdub the last chorus, which went wrong and it took us twenty minutes to tidy it all up.   The next song,  A Century , is certainly the most testing song to sing, and the first take was a bit stretched, and the first line of every verse hard to get right. In the end Ali dropped the recording in pitch and all of a sudden it was much easier. Nonetheless, it took several overdubs to get a decent vocal line (my original attempts were floppy, I am told). The song itself sounds lovely, Pete's tremolo guitar giving it a really nice feel, and my guitar solo so trebly it sounded like a sitar of all things. Low in the mix, Ali!  Having done those two the next two were easy in comparison.  It's Alright  I've sung so many times that I felt like I got it in one take, but Ali asked me to go back over some lines and, actually, we got them much better the second or third time. This song is the only one which we've demoed before, but this new version is tauter and more aggressive, and - with the keyboards - a much better version than the old one. It misses the harmonies, though, and it was this as much as anything that inspired us to decide to hang on a couple of weeks and come back to the backing vocals.  If I thought I'd got  It's Alright  in one take, then I actually did for  You Should Know , or more or less. By now my voice was greatly limbered up, but also quite gravelly, which probably helped the song, as, towards the end, it all gets pretty unhinged. Listening back to this one I really felt that it's the best thing we've done - powerful, but varied, and surprisingly intricate. Best bits: the fantastic intro, the two note lead break half way through, and the lovely keyboards, which echo the vocal melody in the chorus and sound amazing.  Having done all that, I was surprised to find myself pretty knackered. Having recorded 3 times now, this is the first occasion where I've felt comfortable doing it, and confident that I was performing OK. It's not like singing at a rehearsal, much less like playing live: you have to work without adrenaline, which means it's hard to get going. I think Anne-Sophie felt that, to an extent, when she stepped up to record her first ever vocal - for the fairly brutal sounding  Vine to Vine . In fact, she ran through it faultlessly, and standing next to the speakers I could hear straight away that it sounded exactly right. But the thing that makes you feel awkward and lacking confidence, when you're recording, (apart from the bloody tights) is that you don't really hear what you're doing. AS seemed perplexed when we all told her it was a really good take - but when we listened back to it, agreed that it was. I'm afraid that, however much I enjoy singing, we always sound like an indie band when I sing. With AS's vocals, which are more like Nico's than anything, we sound much less ordinary. Not that we don't sound pretty damn good when I sing, of course ;-)  Finishing (surprisingly) ahead of time, we even had time to take another look at our problem child -  Engines and Anvils . Despite not being able to get a decent sound out of the 303 when we first recorded it, Anne-so managed to record her piano line a few weeks ago and, with me singing along (hoping I was doing so in the right place) Pete recorded a lovely, warm guitar part direct through the 8-track. It was the work of moments, and yet it sounded really good. So, if we can find a way to get round the 303 bass line (and Ali is going to give it a go, and, failing that, I can try with my Novation), we should be able to record my vocals and melodica when we do the rest of the  backing vocals. Which, frankly, would be amazing, as I didn't think we were going to get there with this song!  In two weeks, then, we should be finished. As soon as we get it mixed I'll have CDs to send to anyone who wants one, and we'll make sure the tracks are available for download and all that. I'm really excited about hearing it all. Hurrah.

      Courtesy of  urlLink Marina Hyde's Diary ...   "And so to a snapshot of the mood at the Daily Mail, kindly provided by a mischief maker who, having digested her latest riff on the government's immigration policy, decided to contact commentator Melanie Phillips. He had, he said, met a Bulgarian called Ivan Balhakov who'd obtained a visa to work as an NHS surgeon. "He is in fact," the email continued, "completely blind ... claiming disability benefits, and spends much of his days begging ... But he also has a lucrative sideline importing water snakes from Bulgaria to sell to aquariums throughout London ..." A wildly credible tale of a world gone mad then and no wonder Melanie replied swiftly to say she had passed the story to the newsdesk and that they were immediately in touch. "We are very interested in talking to Mr Balhakov about his visa and his blindness," began this email. At this point, our hoaxer came clean. "Who would have thought," he mused in his final communique to the paper, "that a top journalist would believe a story about a blind surgeon called Ball-Hack-Off (or possibly Bollock-Off)? Especially if she received the email on April 1?" It's too disrespectful."   And, seeing as I got all preoccupied with piranhas a few weeks back, the following...   "Berlin aquarium staff were startled to find that a carnivorous piranha fish was recently released in the facility's petting pool for children, Germany's most widely read newspaper, Bild, reported.  The piranha, whose teeth can grow up to two centimetres (three quarters of an inch) long, had already begun taking bites out of other fish when it was found and transferred to another aquarium, curator Rainer Kaiser told Bild.  He said the fish was so rapid that staff had to empty the pool, where children can stroke the fish swimming there, to catch it.  Kaiser was puzzled about how the fish came to be there, but said tortoises and other exotic marine life had been found in the past left "by people wanting to get rid of them but who didn't dare flush them down the toilet."  The razor-toothed piranha can grow to up to 60 centimetres (two feet) long and normally lives in the rivers and lakes of South America. It can be freely bought in specialist pet shops in Germany."

      I've always been fairly obsessional, meaning that once I get interested in something I get fairly single minded about it for a short time, until I put it away and move on to something else. That sounds callous, doesn't it? I don't mean it like that. But I sometimes think of my interests as a kind of revolving assembly line, which, as it rotates, reveals forgotten interests which I add a piece to, and then allow to begin to go round again. Sooner or later that interest will come back round again, and be at the forefront of my mind once more. Then it keeps rotating. When I think about music, the obvious example and the easiest to demonstrate, it's clear. I could even reel off the years and observe the cycle, I'm sure.  1990 Baggy, Indie pop 1991 Shoegazing 1992 Early Warp Records stuff, Hip Hop 1993 Pavement, US Indie 1994 Riot Grrl, UK Indie 1995 Blur, Mod stuff 1996 Synth Pop, R&B 1997 Hip Hop, Mo'Wax 1998 Synth Pop and house music 1999 Punky guitar rock 2000 Hip Hop 2001 XTC, pastoral pop 2002 US indie (Mercury Rev etc) 2003 Modern Classical, Krautrock 2004 IDM, Tech House, Garage  All containing plenty more minute shifts and swings, of course. It's the same for everything else, to a varying lesser or greater extent. Past obsessions: TV comedy, films, comics, football, cutting clippings out of newspapers to make scrapbooks, art galleries, dropping my h's, emphasising them.  What made me think of this, was that although I change my subjects, certain things remain the same. You wouldn't have to try to hard to link together the progressions above, and in a sense they're all united by exactly the same approach: a feverish desire to be discovering new (or old) things, and too much free time and (in the distant past) money. Occasionally something comes along which changes your approach (the obsession with Pavement and UK indie came with the discovery of John Peel and home taping, a marvellously cheap year. I discovered synth pop and the Style Council through car boot sales. Limewire has been instrumental in guiding my music tastes over the last 6 months) but for the most part I've stuck with the same principles, and the same feeling of what it is I'm doing. Looking for just-about-to-be-fashionable, clever music, that I can research and collect, look forward to having, be made cool by.  What made me think all this, eventually, is, well a number of things. Firstly, I reported with enthusiasm to Vic yesterday on a cheap bottle of red wine I'd found via  urlLink Superplonk , and she commented that, if only she'd been    "been 'systematic' enough to realise it, getting you to consult a grid, list or chart proves to be a motivating force for you to do some shopping!"   after which we mused that the research, the categorising, the list-making is most of the fun for me. I've always enjoyed planning my buys and buying the records more than I have enjoyed listening to them (it's  always  a disappointment).  Anyway, likewise books. I even went so far as to start compiling a list of the books I've read the other week. There was not as much variety as I might have expected, heavily dominated by the Amises, by Wodehouse, Julian Barnes etc. The same logic has always applied. I  love  buying books, absolutely adore it. I had a passionate fling with the idea of the author Maggie Gee a month or so ago, all before I had read one of her books, so excited at the idea of a writer who seemed to be interested in things that interested me. Since then I've read two of her books (one great, one not-so-great) and the great passion is quenched. On to the next, then? I always want something to want.  Anyway, I was thinking, then, about all the books that I excluded from the list, the books that I knew I had read, but chose not to add to the list. Invariably they were either bad books (like  The Da Vinci Code , which I recently read) or - more often - the product of brief obsessions.  My dad, incidentally, is the same, though perhaps a little less flighty. But his interests are similarly single-minded. For him, it is boats, or cars, or motorcycles, or bikes, and when one interest runs at the forefront of his mind the house is filled with appropriate magazines, catalogues, items and accessories. When it is time to move on, say from bikes to boats, the magazines change their titles from  Mountain Biker UK  to  Boating Monthly , the catalogues are for marinas, the accessories morph from bicycle wheels to lengths of rope and boat furniture. And for a summer our cupboard was filled with pots of home made jam, when his obsessions took him suddenly in that direction.  When I read, I find it easy to become gripped by the subject matter and it often effects my next choice of book. Lots of the books I've read land in this category; sometimes with comical results. I read Mick Jackson's  Five Boys  a couple of years ago and was somehow intrigued by the beekeeping described in the book. Shortly after, I was attracted to several books with similar themes. In the end I spotted my work book club were reading a book called  The Bee Season  - I joined up and got the book out of my library. As it happens, it was 6 months before I attended a book group session, and the book itself turned out to be about, ahem, spelling bees.   But these aspects of a novel are often what jumps out at me. The kind of book I read, like the kind of music I listen to, falls into a certain type. High-ish brow, wordy, left-of-centre, and led primarily by character rather than plot. I should say at this point that I'm aware I'm making unsatisfactory generalisations. And yet in all these books, where we are asked to examine characters, relationships, and ideas, it's often objects and facts that stay with me. I come away from  Five Boys  (a book about childhood during the war) thinking about beekeeping. It's often these inconsequential things that appeal to me, and I'm aware that my subconscious obsessiveness underpins this somehow. I think... "now I must find out everything about beekeeping". That's maybe not the greatest example. Or maybe it is, because it demonstrates the arbitrariness of the whole affair.  Last night me and Vic watched  urlLink University Challenge , and I was aware that, and it's not the first time I've thought this, there are a great many things that people know which I do not - particularly in the area of science, history and geography. I was wondering where people get this information. Vic pointed out, accurately I think, that one thing about this kind of knowledge is that it's very much the kind of thing one acquires in a private education, something which I didn't have. And I guess there's also a kind of person who thirsts for these things, and hangs on to them.  But it got me thinking again about the books I read and what I learn from them, and I realised that - though I have perhaps gained an insight into people and the way they (and I) think (as well as a tendency, currently much evident towards verbosity) - the books I have read have not really 'taught' me much (in the conventional sense of any better equipping me should my general knowledge be put to the test).   Those books I never listed? Among them were the kind of books (like  The Da Vinci Code ) which I read as time out from the 'proper stuff' - holiday reads, dumb thrillers, comedy, books about pop music; books which are lighter going, I guess. The reason these books have been on mind, I suppose, is that I've just read a couple of Michael Crichton novels -  Timeline (which was mostly awful, actually) and, currently,  Congo . Part of me - and this is silly - feels embarrassed about this, although I don't know why. Perhaps I really am too much of an elitist to admit that sometimes I enjoy something which does not speak from 'inside' the protagonist's (or the author's) head, but which, well,  entertains . And these books do that, and I enjoy them.  And when I think about what they've given me (apart from the excitement that a thriller gives, something which is in itself more exciting than the slow pace of the latest tome by Literary X), I realise that, as an obsessive, these books are actually tremendously attractive to me, because they give me plenty of set-pieces to enthuse about.  So, the books of Michael Crichton. They haven't given me much insight into my fellow man (unless he's a gun runner from Borneo), but  Jurassic Park , for all it's silliness, taught me things I never knew about DNA (and revitalised the sleeping knowledge I have of dinosaurs from when I was a kid),  Timeline  taught me not much about time travel but plenty about medieval villages and architecture (which I find interesting),  Prey  taught me about distributed computing and nanotechnology, and  Congo , which I'm just about to finish, and which I've thoroughly enjoyed, contains heaps of fascinating information about the rainforests, about Africa, and about the differences between Gorillas and Chimpanzees. This is stuff I want to know about, somehow.  Now I'm getting ready to go up to the library and get a book about exploration in the African jungle. You see what I mean? It's addictive.  There are two kinds of reading, and they're both valuable. There's the kind which goes for hidden truths, insights, and strives for moments of beauty and pain. Literary fiction, if you like.  And then there's the kind which just aims to entertain (or, should we strike out into the area of non-fiction, educate), which can be maddeningly bad (not that, say, Martin Amis can't be awful too) but which works with the truths that aren't hidden at all - the kind of truths which one discovers in science, history and geography.   I've always been fairly prejudiced towards the former, and I still am. But the obsessive side of me, which likes to grasp on to something I can research, become an expert in (whether it's Italian football, Beekeeping, Geology, post-war Japan or paganism) can see the appeal of the alternative. So I'll see if I can find the list of books I've read and I'll add  Congo  to the list.  But why am I writing this? Because I'm in the grips of another brief moment of obsession. Email me in a month. We'll see how I feel then.

       urlLink Chris's blog  is lively and grinning with updates, and it's good reading. I keep getting jolts of realisation that he's in Australia. The updates arrive on his blog easily and organically, in time with my browsing, or so it seems. But when I think about the gulf in time (and weather! grim day today) I get a moment of surprise every time. Either way, you don't need to know Chris to find his site interesting; in actual fact, it's very enjoyable reading - I hope he keeps going. That sounds like I'm urging him not to die, rather than to keep writing. Well, why not? Live, Chris!  Live!    urlLink Is downloading music really that bad, asks the Guardian . No, it's not.  After a  urlLink 6music  special and a four page spread in Word Magazine, Andy Partridge gets another page of press in (last friday's) The Guardian. He comes across as a very grumpy boy of course, as usual, but then he is a  bona fide pop genius  so that's well within his rights. I was listening to XTC's wonderful  Skylarking  the other day on the train home from Newcastle, and it's really the most perfect pastoral pop record, better only perhaps by the later  Apple Venus Vol. 1 . Anyway, read on for his Rebellious Jukebox thing, or whatever they call it these days.   urlLink Arts features | Above average Andy   Oh, and this looks like it's got to be interesting... The XTC tribute CD, with all songs by unknown bands, costs under a tenner and contains 138 songs. Some if it is, I read, awful. But that just makes me want to hear it more...    urlLink King for a Day - a tribute to XTC   There's a track to download for free  urlLink here , and it's rubbish :-) But it reminds me of the original, and that's good enough for me! Like I said, pop genius.  (And talking of pop genius, I just bought my copy of Wiley's  Wot Do U Call It?  Well, it's the best single I've heard in absolutely ages.  Years .)

      Andrew has been talking about  urlLink the grimmest albums in his record collection  on his excellent BB blog - irresistible stuff for me and my love of lists, and enough to have me mentally reeling off my depression top ten. And now, writing it down. I can't help noticing I've missed off anything by Lou Reed (and Leonard Cohen! Oh hell!), but that aside, this lot should inspire the bleakest of moods, should you be feeling uncharacteristically cheerful today, and keen to get back to normal...  (not in order)   1. Gravediggaz - 6 Feet Under   Claustrophobic and brimming with malevolence, the first gravediggaz album is suffocating, raw and immensely gloomy. not music for dark nights. "So you wanna die, commit suicide? Phone 1-800, cyanide line".   2. Tindersticks - Tindersticks   The first Tindersticks record (and indeed, every subsequent one) was bruised and melancholy, and chasteningly romantic. "You knew you were lost as soon as you saw her.You saw your life as a series of complicated dance steps, impossible to learn"   3. Blur - The Great Escape   People point to the torpid 13 as Damon's angst record, but the Great Escape fits the bill far better. On first listen full of over-produced and chirpy pop songs, repeated listening reveals an undercurrent of sadness which runs through from  Country House  and it's melancholy coda ("blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why"),  Best Days'  broken "Other people would break into a cold sweat, if they thought that these were the best days of our lives" and Damon's lovely  Yuko and Hiro  ("I drink in the evening. It helps with relaxing. I can't sleep without drinking"). And  The Universal  is, of course, a paean to Prozac.   4. Cure - Seventeen Seconds   People usually point to Faith as the Cure's most depressing record, but it doesn't have  A Forest  on it. This one does. "It's always the same, I'm running towards nothing, again and again and again". Brilliantly sparse and sombre, this is a fantastically depressing album.   5. Notorious BIG - Ready to Die   Granted, it's got  JUICY  on it, possibly the most uplifting hip hop track ever, but when Biggie got dark he was the darkest. In  Things Done Changed  he raps 'My mom's got cancer of the breast. Now you asking why I'm muthafucking stressed?', and from then on the album is brimming with desperate moments, culminating in  Suicidal Thoughts  -  "I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit" - and the album's final moment, a gunshot and a frantic voice calling down a phone line, "Yo, Big? Big?".   6. Alfred Schnittke - Concerto for Piano and Strings   Savage and frightening music.    7. Joy Division - Closer   Far too obvious, but it couldn't be left off the list. Despair in its purest form, with a kinetic quality which would resurface in the wonderful rhythms of New Order. Actually not a record I choose to listen to very often, but undeniably deserving of a place on the list.   8. Arvo Part - Fratres / Tabula Rasa   Not really depressing as such, but heartbreakingly austere. An ideal record for sinking in. Likewise Gavin Bryars'  Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet , which I've decided is, broadly speaking, uplifting. But with it's cold, brooding instrumentation, like Part, it's only a heartbeat away from being painful.   9. The Smiths - The Smiths   Possible to choose any Smiths record and find ample evidence of why it should be on the list. But in  Suffer Little Children  Morrissey wrote what was probably the most depressing lyric and melody in history, so it makes it in for that reason. As dark as music gets. The lyrics really need to be read in full to really appreciate them, but here's "Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads, Oh John, you'll never be a man, And you'll never see your home again. Oh Manchester, so much to answer for". In context, that's got to be the most upsetting lyric ever written.   10. 101 acoustic dirges   In the end, there's nothing more depressing, musically, than the dirge, especially is it's performed on an acoustic guitar, and especially if it's accompanied by weedy, nasal singing. So a last ditch mention for Graham Coxon (who sings "I wish I could bring Nick Drake back to life. He'd understand. Hold my hand") and Syd Barrett. Actually, my particular favourite in this vein is Neutral Milk Hotel's frankly disturbing  King of Carrot Flowers , which opens with a cry of "I loooooove you Jesus Christ!" and never gets much further on my stereo, as Vic will invariably snap the volume off immediately, asking if I've gone insane...

      Spent three days in Newcastle at a conference (for work). It was nice to be back in the North East, even if I only got to see - apart from an hour or so on Wednesday when I had a walk around Eldon Square - the inside of a conference centre and my hotel room. Still, I like Newcastle and like the journey; even not seeing much of it, it was nice to be there. I had a nice walk in the grounds (by Gosforth Park Races) and walked over a bridge which survived a disused railway line.   More typically, when it comes to grabbing my attention, I noticed that the Virgin Megastore in Newcastle now has listening posts on every rack of CDs, which one can use simply by scanning the barcode of any CD in the store, and listening immediately. This is a tremendous innovation! No more buying dodgy CDs on a whim and hating them when I get home. I listened to Pole, the new Tyrant compilation from Fabric, a Michael Mayer mix CD, one of the Andy Partridge demo CDs and the new Squarepusher album. And guess what? I wanted them all :-)  Haven't been down to the Churchill Square Virgin for a few weeks so will have to go down there to see what it's like. But I can't help remembering that, when I was a kid, Cadburys launched Twirl bars up North a year or so before they did down in London, and I had to get my Nan to send me them through the post 'til were launched in the 'sarf. So it's probably the same thing; might just have to spend a few further months spending money with the help of misguided, hopeful intuition...

      ... and surprising to see 4 good bands on the same bill... After the horrors of that band showcase we attended at the Zap a couple of months ago the  urlLink Totally Wired  / Brighton Rocks event at the Komedia on Friday night was a reassuring reminder than not  every  band in Brighton is consumed with teenage angst.  Further, we saw four bands with a bit of imagination.  The first,   urlLink Turncoat  , were reminiscent of Interpol and BSP, but not so much to make them a bore; their songs were a little odd and at times ambitious, sometimes introducing charming piano riffs and peculiar harmonies, though also resorting to a quiet-loud-quiet-loud formula which they would do well to dispense with. But that said I am famously intolerant of unnecessary loud bits and they would do just as well to ignore me. I don't think I'd buy their records, but they were promising.    urlLink Oom   I like very much, beautifully programmed clunks and whirrs, guitars and the kind of blissy, engaging vocals which the likes of Lamb have made almost over-familiar: no disrespect to  Oom , who did it very well.  One kind of wishes that the floodgates for trip-hoppy, glitchy pop music had not been opened so wide that so many inferior, coffee table acts got through - it dilutes the effect of the style when it is done properly. At their best (usually when the electronics took the lead),  Oom  were at least as good as any of the post Bjork, post Portishead contenders. Their set was about ten minutes too long, though.    urlLink La Momo   are the most exuberant and fun band to watch; they seem to  enjoy themselves . I always do too; their set is simple, insistent, peculiar and memorable. I keep thinking of the Residents' peculiar harmonies as their songs whizz along.  La Momo  are the first band I've ever wanted to join on backing vocals.  The Komedia (upstairs) is a really nice venue; perhaps the nicest of its size in Brighton (certainly an improvement on The Pressure Point and the Pavilion Theatre). The series of Brighton Rocks nights have been, I gather, quite a success, and I can see why. The final band of the night,  Waxed Apple , were really super-engaging; no more bad indie haircuts, no more harmonies, and lots of fun with violins, cellos, huge drums, lurching bass and edgy electronics. Sampling themselves as they went along, delivering dizzy dub workouts or - once - an electrifying piece of instrumental hip hop with chilling RZA-style piano chops, they opened with the best couple of tracks I've heard live in a long time.   As the set progressed they seemed to wind down a bit, or perhaps I just got used to their unpredictable set-up and wanted more surprises, but they have the essence of a unique sound. Veterans of the  urlLink Spirit of Gravity  nights (which I've never made it to), they seem to have more up their sleeve besides; a bit of hunting around on the web suggests that previous gigs have been quite different - the  urlLink Gravity newsletter  reports of a previous show...   "They went all experimental on us. No drums, no violin and a new member with a bad, bad hat. The set started with nearly ten minutes of multiple seconds long movie dialogue snippets, each referencing the current war in Iraq. Added to that were locked grooves on a turntable playing Asian harps, chanting and birdcall; and live vocal sampling. It seemed like a completely new set; harsher, more effects, less laid back".   Without being able to tell you exactly what to expect, then, I recommend them...

      A great article  urlLink here , which I turned up on some spurious web crawl; an utterly bizarre and peculiar examination of whether or not  The Smiths  were a  conservative rock band . This author, who is clearly a bit mad, thinks they're not. I could quote from it pretty much at random.   "They confound whoever wishes to analyze them but the one thing they do not appear to be is conservative. When Morrissey sang "I'd like to drop my trousers to the queen…the poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms" we do not think of laissez faire economics"   True enough. Granted our man gets a bit bogged down in discussing Moz's sexuality and gets a bit out of his depth, but he's never less than entertaining. At one point he cries   "This worthless era of hip-hop and rap is infinitely depressing"    Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ, Hang the...  oh, sorry, got distracted.   Infinitely depressing? Oh,  you Smiths fans!  I thought that's what you LIKED!

      1. Why is that, even though I know very well that the clock on the outside of Brighton Station is at least three minutes fast, every single morning for the last three months, when I have got off my bus outside the station I have looked up at the clock and panicked? It's fast. I know it's fast. And yet every morning I forget. What is wrong with me?  2. Anyone else just feel really depressed at the incineration of all those works of art? It's just horrible. People tend to focus on the fact that Tracey Emin's tent has been lost but there's so much more that has been destroyed; the Chapmans'  Hell  (which was just  magnificent ), early Chris Ofilis, stuff by Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Patrick Caulfield, Paula Rego, 50 paintings by Patrick Heron ( 50! ) - it's just  tragic . The Daily Mail's suggestion that the art was 'just rubbish' deserves only contempt :-(  3. Anyone hugely cheered, despite it all, by Chris Ofili's response?   "The super hero Captain Shit has in-built protection against the flames of Babylon. He will return ... the saga continues."   :-)   (postscript; five minutes later.   Just read another quote; this time by Dinos Chapman.  "It's only art - there are worse things happening around the world." )

      Bit of a traumatic rehearsal last night, as  Engines and Anvils  made its customary last minute bid to get dropped from the set. The problem this time was an out of tune keyboard. We might be down to six songs for the gig, then, unless we can solve the problem quickly.... Set sounds great, that apart, though.  Been mucking around with designing covers for the last day or two. Quite like this one - kind of Watery Domestic-era Pavement...     The background is the super-exposed town of Shishmaref in Western Alaka, where global warming and the thawing permafrost are collapsing towns in on themselves.  urlLink More info here .

      Tried out the first three tracks of the new Orb album in MVC at lunchtime; odd that it's actually been so long since I listened to them that I'd kind of forgotten what they sound like, although I remember now. Of the three tracks only one really jumped out at me. The first,  Orb is  made me think of Groove Armada, consisting as it does of a laidback hip hop beat (played on live drums), a naff trumpet sample and moody, swishy synths. The next,  Aftermath  was  much  better; a brittle, fairly ordinary hip hop beat (which in fairness later twists into a much more appealing techno clatter) and string sweeps and a just  lovely  vocal from Soom-T, a really odd, juddering rap with bursts of near-patois and an accent which swings from New York to her native Glasgow.  The Land of Green Ginger  isn't a new song and I've heard it before, and it's kind of old-school Orb - an arpeggiated synth-riff which sounds great when it twins up, towards the end, with the tinny electro beat, but the vocal samples and ambient noodles are just  so  irritating. I'll have a listen to some more in my lunch hour tomorrow; so far my impression is that it's more beat-y than previous efforts, but a bit aimless thus far - at times it had me thinking of pre-Endtroducing MoWax stuff; head-nodding and well produced but ultimately thin.

      Another odd thing about that Streets record - can anyone recall a record in the hip hop / garage / urban genre which resists all temptation to brag about the rapper's finesse with lyrics or beats? Better than that, the words "The Streets" don't even appear on  A Grand Don't Come For Free . In fact the only mention of music on the entire record is when Mike mentions his, erm, admiration for  urlLink Femme Fatale , and even then he's not talking about her mixing skills. The closest it comes to "Original Pirate Material - you're listening to The Streets" is that 'No-one gives a crap about Mike' chorus - that's the only way he refers to himself. And the only other mention of music on the entire LP is oblique; that awkward trance riff in 'Blinded By The Lights'. I'm not sure  why  I really like this fact, as I've no objection to name-dropping in music. I just like the way he's decided not to.

      Certain events draw us all together - universal things, things that touch everyone...   Yes, that's right, I resisted it so far but I think it's time I mentioned  urlLink Eurovision . Not because it was any better or worse than usual, of course, although the winning song was, I think, particularly tuneless, but because there's plenty to read on the subject and lots of it entertaining. Andrew from  urlLink Bedsit Bomber  started the ball rolling with his  urlLink minute by minute  dissection of the songs as they played, creating some lovely descriptions along the way. Simon at No Rock and Roll Fun  urlLink did the same , and - showing remarkable prescience - got behind Ruslana from the start. Between them there's a wealth of insight...   Bedsit Bomber: Holland. The singer's taken the whole "orange" motif a bit too literally, just remembering to leave a gap for the mouth.    No Rock And Roll Fun: Norway - Knut Anders Soren. A really, really cheap-looking silver suit here; they must have been collecting tinfoil all over the nation for this.    BB: F.Y.R. Macedonia. Wet-look hair, funny moustache; "string" beard; high-collared, fluted, Flash Gordon tunic; huge belt buckle; and enormous satin flares. Truly extraordinary look, but the song's pretty hard to digest. At best, 4/10.    NRARF: Croatia - Ivan Mikulic. Apparently this was a big hit in Croatia. He's got a tiny set of features placed on a very large face, like having a kid's meal on the All Day Breakfast plate. At times the song appears to want to turn into a James Bond theme - the AHa one, we think - but never quite works up the momentum.    Greece. "Shake, shake, shake ... give it some more". The girls get their costumes ripped off by the lupine guy in the white jacket and ripped jeans. Now they've ripped his jacket off! Where will it end?    Poland - Blue Cafe. Called 'Love song", which sounds like it was a working title and they forgot to change it. The singer is Betty Blue's more homely young sister, wearing a revealing dress which could have put a nymphomaniac in need of viagra; some guys in white suits with brass; a bloke with guitar - they all produce a bit of a mess. Betty Blue Junior sings Love Song "Laave Sung", like she's in fackin' eastenders.    United Kingdom. If Bernard Sumner had fallen off his yacht, been washed up on a Turkish beach after a week at sea, then dragged comatose to the Eurovision auditorium by the authorities and had an 80s suit put on him, you'd have the look of James Fox   Elsewhere, everyone got into a flap about the vote-rigging. But Jakester at The Uncertainty Principle is more relaxed.  urlLink Block voting happened. And it was hilarious.  He quotes  urlLink Pop Justice ...   "Let's not blame Fox's failure on block voting by neighbouring countries. After all, Ireland gave us our highest mark of the night, and we gave Ireland their only points, so it's obviously not favouritism that annoys the Wogans of this world, it's just the fact that not enough people actually like the UK for it to work in our favour."   Anyone with any sense at all ignored the ridiculous machinations of the voting systems, the vast majority of the music (and no sense of British superiority here -  urlLink Sam Wallaston  in the Guardian noted that James Fox's  "lamentable song, Hold On to Our Love, made me want to shoot myself, and thoroughly deserved the nul points most people gave it." ) and simply enjoyed the spectacle. If he can bear it, the normally infuriating Terry Wogan can have a job for life doing this. At one point Russia paid tribute to the Ukraine, and Tel noted, ironically, 'such a great history of friendship between the two nations'....  And Ruslana will be huge, there's no doubting it. Popbitch says   she's fabulous - drinks like a fish, loves Deep Purple and Bach, plans to write a Rock Opera, and vocally supports gay rights in Ukraine. When her Eurovision translator failed to translate her swearing properly Ruslana corrected him to make sure he said "shit" not "hell".   Most positive about it all was Joan Bakewell, who remarks  urlLink in her Guardian column  that it is a  "a time-warp record of how we are and how we might be, left over from a more innocent age. It has become part of television's own archaeology, the strata of different eras laid down, yielding to the knowing viewer its clues to shifting allegiances and loyalties" .  And what a demonstration of how Europe has changed and shifted.    "What a line-up the eastern countries made against the puny presence of old Europe: France, Britain and Ireland got hardly a look in. What came striding through with the vigour of a new world were the former Balkan and Soviet states"   I did read, cringing, a day or two later, an old interview with James Fox, our hapless entrant, from a few days before the contest. It appears he was pretty confident of winning. Oh dear. But Andrew sums the whole thing up best when he suggests that  "There's no place for bitterness and recrimination. If James Fox is picked up in the early hours of Sunday morning, staggering through the dim-lit streets of Istanbul, swearing at revellers, and smelling strongly of alcohol, we should have no sympathy for the embittered former singer - it's just a bit of fun."   Fun!? Are you joking? For us bloggers this is serious business....

      Victoria has eyes like a hawk. The Evening Standard website carries the disconcerting headline  urlLink 'Thousands may have CJD' , after some new research has raised the prospect that around 4,000 Britons may unknowingly have varient CJD. Slightly to the right of the said article another headline,  urlLink 'With Relish' , implores us to celebrate one hundred years of the burger!!!

      No-one ever let them tell you it's fun being a Christian...    Childless couple told to try sex    A German couple who went to a fertility clinic after eight years of marriage have found out why they are still childless - they weren't having sex.  The University Clinic of Lubek said they had never heard of a case like it after examining the couple who went to see them last month for fertility tests. Doctors subjected them to a series of examinations and found they were both apparently fertile, and should have had no trouble conceiving.  A clinic spokesman said: "When we asked them how often they had had sex, they looked blank, and said: "What do you mean?".  "We are not talking retarded people here, but a couple who were brought up in a religious environment who were simply unaware, after eight years of marriage, of the physical requirements necessary to procreate."   Meanwhile, according to the Times (who I won't link to as you can only read their articles for seven days before you have to register)...     The world's first cyber pulpit has been shut down after a large number of online worshippers logged in as  Satan  and shouted expletives. The internet Church of Fools, opened last week at  urlLink churchoffools.com , is sponsored by the Methodist Church, which takes a strong line against profanity. It allowed online visitors to kneel to pray, cross themselves and perform an arm-raising "hallelujah!".   Church wardens are on duty with "smite buttons" to consign blasphemers to virtual hell. But some of the worst offenders are from the US and Australia and visit in the middle of the night, when the wardens are asleep. Hackers have broken in disguised as wardens, sworn at the congregation or greeted newcomers by saying " Satan  loves you".   The organisers have now closed the pulpit and apse to visitors. They have also removed the "shout" button so that worshippers can whisper to those closest to them without the whole church hearing. The number of wardens is also to be increased.    Virtual parishioners reacted defiantly. One message on the site's internet chat room yesterday said: "It's just a load of sad individuals playing 'wind up the Christians'."   Since it was announced at the Christian Resources Exhibition last week, the site has attracted 20,000 visits a day. Stephen Goddard, a spokesman for the cyber chapel, said: "We obviously use the ‘smite’ button where we can. But we have very few resources to police it 24 hours a day."   He drew an analogy with John Wesley, the 18th-century founder of Methodism: "When Wesley went out in the early days, people swore at him, made  braying noises like a donkey  and spat on him. At least we know we are not preaching to the converted."   And finally, spotted this link on  urlLink Mark K-Punk's  blog -  urlLink CS Lewis: The Devil's Finest Tool . Brilliant. My favourite bit is  "The Chronicles of Narnia are one of the most powerful tools of  Satan  that Lewis ever produced. Worst of all, these books are geared toward children. Please go to the next page to read about this indoctrinating tool of witchcraft"...    Don't.    urlLink Go here, instead . I worked with Tim on the  urlLink Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians  a few years back, and just found his blog - The Rambler. It's  really  excellent.

      A nice article by Jackie Ashley on Michael Moore  urlLink in the Guardian today ; she sums him up pretty well. Over the last year or two I've kind of blown hot and cold on what he does - like Mark Thomas he does that self-satisfied thing a bit too much and I find it irritating - but Ashley points out that he's as self-aggrandising as he is because he wants to be  as much of a nuisance as he can possibly be . He wants to hog the limelight and shout about what he believes, and to do that you have to be populist, brash and confident. And god knows it's hard getting across a liberal perspective in the States.   "But now America has Michael Moore. He's huge. Huge personally - a great big hairy doughball of a man. He's huge commercially. He's huge on the web. And he's huge in the scale of his ambition - he is determined to bring down George Bush"   Having read some reviews, I  really  wanna see  urlLink Fahrenheit 911!

      A rather uninspiring Turner prize shortlist has been announced; on first glance it is pretty straightforward, uninspiring stuff - nothing as dazzling and wonderful as the Chapmans' exhibit last year (and plenty as unimpressive as Grayson Perry's). There's a  urlLink feature displaying several works  by the nominated artists on the Guardian, but it doesn't give much away - not a single work is aesthetically pleasing.   Of the nominated artists, I'd hope that the decision would rest between Jeremy Deller and  urlLink Langlands and Bell . The former, like all four of the artists, is avowedly political; a video artist whose films reference George Bush and Texas as well as the Miner's Strike, which he memorably  urlLink recreated using military re-enactment societies and former miners . Langlands and Bell look reasonably interesting, if not exactly exciting. Their recent work includes a project  urlLink 'The House of Osama Bin Laden'  which is, apparently,  "an interactive virtual reality model of an abandoned house in Afghanistan" . I'm not quite sure what that means...  The Guardian says that  "Yinka Shonibare is shortlisted for his sculptural installations in which he uses African fabric to subvert conventional readings of cultural identity" . That's as maybe, but the pictures I've seen of his stuff are just  vile , and I would like to stress that I do not mean that in the same way that Thatcher meant her covering up of the African print on the British Airways model all those years ago:       I feel we have a Grayson Perry situation developing here, mind... Shonibare does at least make art which one feels like one could reach out and touch - often important. I suspect the public may make more of his exhibition than his contemporaries.  Kutlug Ataman apparently makes eight hour films about life in Turkey. I mean, very well, but whatever happened to art as immediate, sudden, even (and I use this word advisedly given the path it has led much modern art down in recent years)  shocking ? Well, I won't pass judgement on Ataman 'til I've seen a bit of his films, but it all rather makes one yearn for Jake and Dinos, no?

      Some more thoughts on travel, having read Geoff Dyer's super  Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do it  and written a little about it, about the author's conception of a  zone  - not a physical space which can be travelled to (with the exception of Black Rock City), but the moment of absolute, peaceful pre-occupation which occurs sometimes, which is sudden and temporal. Dyer, we sense, is a good traveller; a traveller who does not go looking for something, but who goes hoping it will find him somehow.  I'm re-reading Malcolm Bradbury's hilarious  Rates of Exchange  at the moment. His protagonist, the hapless Petworth, waits for his plane to board in a Heathrow departure lounge, about to head to an unknown European city somewhere 'east of the Rhine'.    On the digital clock, flight time comes and goes; Petworth orders another Scotch and finds himself caught by and old and nameless fear - the fear of being trapped here, for all eternity, in the unassigned, stateless space between all the countries, condemned to live forever in a cosmopolitan nowhere, on clingfilm-wrapped sandwiches, duty free whisky, tiptree's jam.   Not the stateless space that Dyer writes about, this...   It is a fate he knows he deserves; he is a man who has spent his life circling around and away from domestic interiors, hovering between home, where he sits and thinks, and abroad, where he talks and drinks.  Travel is a manic cycle, with abroad the manic phase, at home the depressive; there is some strange adrenelin that draws him into the fascination and the void of foreignness, with the plurality of sensation, its sudden spaces and emptiness. He travels, he thinks, for strangeness, disorientation, multiplication and variation of the self; yet he is not a good traveller...    I've been discussing with my parents the many holidays we went on when I was a child, trying to sift between them and work out which happened when, and in what order. It's very difficult to make each its own and put it into context. All our holidays, many of which were in repeated destinations, blend together like an unsorted collection of photographs. The only bits I remember, if you like, was when I was 'in the zone'. I have a particurly strong memory of a weekend in Evesham with my grandparents when I ran my hand along the side of a cobbled house, for instance  Other memories are significant because they represent moments when I struck out for myself; my first drink of beer (actually a french shandy called 'Force Four'); the first time my parents let me out on the town in the evening without them, the time me and Zoe escaped altogether and made for the motorway... Mostly these memories are fragmented and the circumstances which surrounded them are hazy. This seems oddly fitting, though, because they were strange, dislocated moments which together form the plurality of sensation which made up my childhood. I'm torn between working out more - fitting dates together - and leaving them where they are; like torn pages from an old scrapbook I fleetingly kept.

      The Guardian writes today that a  urlLink previously unseen Kingsley Amis poem  has been discovered by his biographer, Zachary Leader. It's reproduced below.    Untitled   Things tell less and less: The news impersonal And from afar; no book Worth wrenching off the shelf. Liquor brings dizziness And food discomfort; all Music sounds thin and tired, And what picture could earn a look? The self drowses in the self Beyond hope of a visitor. Desire and those desired Fade, and no matter: Memories in decay Annihilate the day.  There once was an answer: Up at the stroke of seven, A turn round the garden (Breathing deep and slow), Then work, never mind what, How small, provided that It serves another's good  But once is long ago And, tell me, how could Such an answer be less than wrong, Be right all along?  Vain echoes, desist   The Guardian suggests, rightly, I think, that it is a suitable companion poem to Larkin's magnificent  Aubade , which  urlLink you can read here , if you are minded to do so.

      listening to  urlLink DJ Letitia  on 1xtra with a cup of tea. She plays some brilliant records; just heard  Controversy  by Hot Sounds ft Fonti - that tune woke me up and killed my hangover in one shot. She's currently playing a kind of mash up she's compiled with the help of her listeners, who have voted on various songs whose constituent parts have beens pliced together to create 'the heaviest song ever'. I heard elements of Biz Markie's  Beat Box  and  Just a Friend , a verse by Bounty Killer, Canibus's strangely dated LL diss and fragments of Diz and Wiley. It all sounded pretty ropey together, I sadly report, but it was a nice idea, and probably sounding great in its early stages.

Parallax View  seems to have been written exclusively for me, oddly, containing as it does interesting stuff about the Fiery Furnaces, Maggie Gee,  urlLink Helen Walsh  and The Stills, all of whom have been recommended to a greater or lesser extent in recent months by Assistant Blog - as well as lots more music, arts and cinema related stuff.  Silent Words Speak Loudest  covers similar territory with painful thoughts on Newcastle's season breaking from midfield. Both blogs are great reads.

      Just watched  urlLink Morrissey  on Jonathan Ross's programme; such an odd fellow, and by no means as likeable as one might hope. Nevertheless, it is truly unsettling to watch someone who is  honest  when he is asked questions. Or perhaps it is all part of the act, I'm not sure, although he told Ross, self importantly,   "This is all real. Only seals perform".  Either way, he was caustic and obstructive in the face of the heavily ironic questions he faced. "Will you be my friend?", Jonathan Ross asked. Morrissey squirmed. "I don't think so", he eventually replied. "Why not?", the host came back. "I have too many friends, and you don't have enough".   Silence from Morrissey. "How many friends do you have?", Ross continued. "Seven", his guest replied.   "I don't like people", he said, elsewhere.  The two songs he played were very different. I think that  Irish Blood, English Heart  is a fine pop single, largely by virtue of that lovely, tremulous "there is no one on earth I'm afraid of" line. Yet the closing  urlLink Every Day is Like Sunday , was just, ooh,  magnificent .   Trudging slowly over wet sand back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is the coastal town that they forgot to close down   His voice, occasionally, still soars. We were wondering, my dad and me (for I am visiting my parents this weekend), how old he was when the first Smiths record was released. Because how does so someone so young, so serious, create such a singular style, such a self-assured presence? If Morrissey is a berk now, which of course he is, how much better that he is supremely confident and arrogant having  done it all , having done  so much , rather than being, say, Paul Weller, whose achievements are so lauded, and yet who pales into insignificance in comparison.  And not just him. How did David Byrne and Elvis Costello do it? How did they create such overwhelming, stunningly original material at such tender years? All my songs, my poetry, my writing before I was 23 I now find immature and derivative (and will doubtless think the same of this in two years time). So Morrissey can at least claim he earned the right, I suppose. The right to be above change, to be Morrissey above all else, the right to be alone, as only Morrissey can be...  "So Morrissey", Jonathan Ross says, "You keep saying you want to be my friend..."

      OK - so as you can see, I've redesigned the blog, or rather - utilising Blogger's new templates - I've shifted my old blog into a new pair of clothes. I feel slightly guilty, as I actually did quite a lot of fiddling with the old template (to the point where I - vainly - considered it mine) - this new one looks nice, I think - but it's off-the-peg. Still, the new Blogger does offer several whizzy things, like the profile (right) and comments facility, which I trust will see a little use after my barren attempt at introducing them previously. Even if you've only wandered onto the site in search of information on Gordon Ramsay (hello!) or Kano's version of 'Fit But You Know It'...   You see, I've been reading my referrals. You know, if you drop me a line I can talk about reality TV for as long as you like :-)  Lots of good stuff in  urlLink the Guardian  today, as is usually the case on Thursdays.  An  urlLink article on political web-game playing  is not particularly interesting, bar one paragraph which describes a game called  urlLink September 12th :   A controversial "news game" created by Frasca and a team of Uruguayan programmers, it shows a crowded town, where Arab terrorists mingle with ordinary people. Your job is to get terrorists without killing civilians. But no matter how carefully you aim, you end up with some collateral damage. When that happens, lots more terrorists appear. Think of it as SimChomsky.   Frasca says the idea was to play around with gaming conventions. The sniper rifle is meant to suggest the idea of a surgical strike, but when you fire, in Frasca's words "you create a big mess". And, in contrast to most games, you can't shoot constantly - you are forced to wait and see the results of each missile fired. So players are denied their thumb candy and forced to think instead.    There's also a feature on camera mobiles in the what's new section. Now, first, let me set my stall out by saying that I do not have a camera phone, and - although I wouldn't say no if someone gave me one - my interest factor in them is practically zero. Give me a polaroid camera any day of the week. However, the following  does  sound really interesting, so  there's me eating my words ...    Snap happy  O2 is hoping to use the camera phone to resurrect the British tradition of sending holiday postcards. Subscribers to the network can now send hard copies of their photos accompanied by a short message simply by sending the image, text and address details via SMS to O2. The network then creates a postcard that is sent first class to be delivered the next day in the UK no matter where the picture was taken. Compatible with all O2 camera phones, the O2 PhotoCards can be sent in more than 50 countries. They cost... (snip)   Anyway, far more interesting than all of that is Jonathan Raban's  urlLink excellent article on the culture of dehumanisation  and orientalism which is so clearly evident in America's war with Iraq. When I was at university I started a book by Raban, Soft City, which I rate to this day as one of the most excitingly written serious books I've attempted. When I say 'attempted' you will realise that, love the first chapter as I did, I never finished it, somehow. Anyway, he is on form here,   The jail has become a grotesque nursery, with Private Lynndie England (her very name like the nom de guerre of a sex worker), cigarette jutting from her cheerful grin, playing the part of the au pair from hell. The pictures appear to be so single-minded in their intent, so artfully directed, so relentlessly orientalist in their conception, that one looks instinctively for a choreographer - a senior intelligence officer, perhaps, who keeps Edward Said on his bedside table, and ransacks the book each night for new ideas.

      "OK", Vic says, "But are there many banging tunes on the record?"  Um. Apart from Fit But You Know It, not really no. At least, nothing in the same league as 'Has It Come to This' or 'Weak Become Heroes'. But just in case you read what I wrote below and wondered if I was talking about a pop record at all... yes, I was. I've already got about five different choruses from the LP rotating around in my head.

       urlLink Tom Ewing's  Popular   Project looks awesome. He is reviewing the UK's 950+ Number One singles since 1952, in order. He's up to 1960 at the moment. It's a staggeringly ambitious project, so all power to him for doing it. His reviews, currently charting a period of music in which I have no interest at all, yet he still writes engagingly. A keeper.  Meantime, some initial thoughts on The Streets LP. It's dazzling. If Wiley's  Treddin'  was a surprise because the lyrical content was bouncier and more charming than the icy promise of the music and the 'cold in my heart' brags, then  A Grand Don't Come For Free  is absolutely fascinating for the fact that at times the narrative seems to swallow the music entirely. It's closest comparison (by my way of looking at it) is Posy Simmonds' incredible graphic novel, 'Gemma Bovary' which, although using a format readily identifiable (in her case, the comic - in Mike Skinner's, the concept album) twists out of it's genre by the force of its sheer narrative genius. Skinner's record is as much as a talking book as a pop record. I've heard snooty critics disparaging the simplicity of Mike's plot (boy loses money, boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy finds money) and suggesting that - if we are going to call it a (grimace) concept LP - then it is lacking in conceptual ambition.  Quite to the contrary, the album is brilliantly observant and hilariously frank, a considerable achievement whether your plot is as complex as an Umberto Eco novel or as stark as one of Magnus Mill's parables (you see, I can't compare it to, say, Dizzee or Eminem - although the abiding musical echo I hear in the record is Terry Hall, another wonderful storyteller).  I was writing back cover copy for a book the other day and included the quote - "Stories are quite insistent on one point: a tale is not over until it is finished in every detail".  A Grand Don't Come For Free  has a beginning, a middle and an ending. Actually, two endings.   It's a brilliant record.

       urlLink Sublime Frequencies  is a US record label which publishes field recordings by Alan Bishop (of jazz-rock noiseniks  urlLink The Sun City Girls ). Their current series of releases comprise of peculiar, beautifully edited recordings of radio, news broadcasts, conversations and found sounds from a variety of destinations. Three new records, 'Radio Palestine', 'Radio Morocco' and 'I Remember Syria' are particularly intriguing. This month's Wire writes that what seperates these CDs from other field recordings is that:   they are not merely recorded straight, out in a field, in real time - set up (you suspect), prearranged, documented and tagged. Instead we are presented with a re-edited mosaic of noices, voices, snatches of Saharan pop music, jazz and orchestras....  Palestine  is practically an electronic collage of tiny radiophonic motes, combined with a piece of musique concrete such as [stockhausen's] Hymnen, that makes the piece more like a transformed objet trouve than a documentary.   Going back to Buck 65, who I mentioned in an earlier post, this is more in the way of scavaging for sounds, foraging for sources. I find lots of 'found sound' music / 'found object' art less than thrilling, and often positively pretentious. But there is something about this project which is very appealing. Of the CDs, which I've been listening to a lot recently, Radio Morocco is the most accessible, but all three are fascinating.  Anyway - if you  really  want a pretentious take on it:   urlLink Pitchfork get poetical

       Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares  was brilliant again. The way he motivates (in stark contrast to the two men at the centre of today's installment, the head chef and proprieter, both of whom needed, in Gordon's words, to  grow some balls ) made me think of his background in football. The head chef, like the captain, must be constantly talking, guiding younger team-mates on, reassuring them, giving them a good ballocking when necessary (and of course, when not). Yet Gordon Ramsey is surprisingly loveable too; not a bully at all, at times almost tender, and always funny. And the name, the ancestry, the wit... the ginger hair... I've seen it before somewhere...

      Been doing a bit of catching up on the activities of  urlLink British Sea Power  by reading their always entertaining  urlLink newsletters . It seems if an opportunity was going to present itself for me to get a copy of their ltd edition single,  A Lovely Day Tomorrow , I may have missed the deadline, as it was available throughout April at their gigs, although it is not impossible I suppose that the lovely people at Brighton's  urlLink Rounder Records  will have a copy somewhere or other. Either way, the idea behind it sounds delightful.  British Sea Power being British Sea Power, of course, they've not got the time or inclination to get obsessed with, say, Woody Guthrie or the Nuggets box sets. No, they've become obsessed with Czechoslovakia - musically, politically, architecturally and even, it seems, alcoholically...   The British Sea Power concert in Prague also sees the band enter into association with the renowned Czech brewer, Budweiser Budvar of Ceske Budejovice. Of course, this happy alliance should not be confused with the typical and tawdry round of booze-rock sponsorship. The fact Budvar are giving the band a modest amount of cash money does not alter this in the slightest. Oh no. BSP are, of course, immune to the notion of money as an end in itself. Just as music and myth are machines for the suspension of time, money for BSP is a mechanism that allows us to do what we must. Frankly, the more of the money supply that BSP can control at any moment, the better for the world.   More usefully,  A Lovely Day Tomorrow  is recorded in conjunction with Czech group  urlLink The Ecstasy Of Saint Theresa , and features both English and Czechoslovakian versions. Now, I don't know about you, but I find this idea hilarious and hugely contagious.   In this month's  urlLink The Wire , Canada's excellent  urlLink Buck 65 , talking about MC Solaar (who, incidentally, is interviewed to interesting effect  urlLink here ) says "Who has the patience, say, to discover what's going on in the Greek music world?". Well, apart from the fact that Franz Ferdinand commisioned a piece on  urlLink Rebetiko  when they  urlLink guest-edited G2  a couple of weeks ago, it's a good question. Talking about one of his (and my) musical heroes, Harry Partch, Buck 65 discusses his near-gamelan style (more echoes of Wiley here, but I shall restrain myself) and his lack of affinity with the Western musical tradition - and I was thinking again how brave, exciting (and foolhardy!) to look outside the usual Anglo-American sounds we're inundated with.   Elsewhere Woebot displays a  urlLink stunning collection of front covers from African Ethnographic recordings , noting wryly that it's  "sort of shambolic ... not be able to talk about these recordings in the way one might the latest Garage "joint."" .  I note that the BSP single is, in fact, being widely touted for sale on ebay, so maybe I'll get it yet. In the meantime I've resolved to get 3 albums out of the library tomorrow, and make sure that none of them are from the UK or the US :-)

      A rather unsuccessful night out last night. Buoyed by the good weather (the last couple of days in Brighton have been just  gorgeous . By contrast it's pouring with rain right now, and I'm sitting here listening to the fire alarm going off and wondering who's burnt their lunch) we decided to go to the Hold Up alldayer, which was a 5pm-2am event at the Zap put on by the boys who do the DJ nights at the (ahem) Pavilion Tavern and Arc. It consisted of six or seven bands and a club thing.   Now, if we'd have thought about it in advance, we would probably have realised how bad it would be. The presence of  urlLink The Tenderfoot  on the bill notwithstanding, we hadn't heard of the other bands playing, and this is normally a recipe for Brighton-rocks style awfulness. Indeed, when we turned up we watched a band (whose name I shan't reveal) who were certainly amongst the worst bands I've seen in ten years of gig-going. Additionally, Hold-Up  the club  (at the Arc) is turgid; bad indie record after bad indie record. So putting the two together would never work.  To make matters worse, Vic is on antibiotics for her bad foot and I'm on the sympathy wagon, which meant neither of us were drinking. Reasoning that we could probably stick it out until  The Tenderfoot  came on and then escape immediately afterwards, we sat through the first band, some clueless DJing, and observed the rituals of a clientele all of whom seemed, bar us, to be explitly flouting the  over 18s only  rule.  Eventually, a band limbered up and began a laboured punk rock / john spencer / idiot-savant routine which was - frankly - the nail in the coffin. Actually, the nail in the coffin was when they announced "We're the last band on tonight" and we realised we'd missed The Tenderfoot. We made way, hoping to find solace in a bar on Ship Street which was having an electroclash night. We tried it, but despite the excellent music - 'Deceptacon' by Le Tigre - we moved on elsewhere; it was overdressed and showy, and crap. Eventually we went for a (non-alcoholic, sigh) drink in the bar at the Joogleberry playhouse, which was, as it happens, lovely, although the fact that we had missed the food by moments didn't lift our mood much.  Still - I'm happy to report that 'The World's Wildest Police Videos' on C5 when we got back was  fine.

      A really productive rehearsal yesterday, as - once more - the completion of the demo was put on hold as we gear ourselves up for next month's gig. We're doing a 35 minute set, which is about seven songs or so, and we're keen to include at least a couple of new tracks, but as we've got about eight new ones on the boil we need to settle down and try to finish two or three; which means finalising vocals and arrangements, for the most part.  Of the new songs, the likeliest contenders are  I'm Shit  and  What It Means . Having struggled with a vocal line last time we attempted the former song, I decided to scrap everything I had bar the two bits which worked the best, meaning that the songs sounds simpler and catchier. With a vocal line and Anne So's keyboards it sounds a bit less  urlLink Teenage Fanclub  style indie-pop, which is good, although it still has a kind of bounciness which made me think, fleetingly, of  urlLink Franz Ferdinand . The title is a bit silly, but I wanted to counterbalance the chirpy mood of the song with some slightly darker lyrics;   I'm so sick, of getting fixed with all this well meant medicine - advice -  I'm feeling sick I need to lie down   Keen to add some unusual middle eights and tricks to the songs to make them sound a bit more original, we worked out a nice instrumental break towards the end of the song which necessitates me grabbing hold of my melodica to play a little melody; quite hard to time it right, so we'll have to practice that. But the song is almost complete - we just need to play it through with Andy, who was absent yesterday - and it'll be ready for the gig.   What It Means  was over-complicated yesterday by confusion over the arrangement. Originally I intended the main chords of the song to be played on the piano, which is how we first rehearsed it. However, we then switched to Pete playing them on the guitar. Unable to work out, yesterday, which was better, we ended up with neither; Pete finding some more interesting, clipped guitar sounds and Anne-So inventing a really nice little piano melody, vaguely oriental, which sits under the bass and sounds excellent. Additionally, I dropped my guitar line out of the verses meaning that my vocals carried the song's main melody (rather like in  Easy to Leave ). As a result a song which, when I demoed it, sounded full of noise and a bit relentless, now has a complex, interesting arrangement with lots of holes, lots of space. After the second chorus almost everything drops out and I have to sing, stretching my voice, and rather terrifyingly...   Do you have any sympathy for me? Well, I don't suppose so. No, no, I don't suppose so, no no.   before the rest of the band join back in again. It sounds good, but this makes me feel nervous. Especially when I have to yelp 'ooooh my' in a moment of silence seconds earlier, sounding like Frankie Howard being strangled. Hmmm.  Adding those two leaves us with a prospective set list something like: 1. You Should Know 2. Easy To Leave 3. I'm Shit 4. 5. What it Means 6. Vine to Vine 7. Engines and Anvils  So just one more song to do. We've got a fast instrumental which sounds a bit like  urlLink British Sea Power , the very complicated  Don't Ask Me  or  Too Many Problems  to drop in. Probably the latter. We worked on it briefly yesterday. Like  I'm Shit  and  Easy to Leave  it's empty and sparse, although we added a big orchestral flourish to the chorus via Anne-So's laptop. It's crying out for a good vocal line - which means  my job for the week is to write one.

       Jim Cousins is the Labour member of Parliament (MP) for the Central Ward in Newcastle upon Tyne.   From the  urlLink Jim Cousins (or "Not the real Jim Cousins Blog").    "This blog is not run by Jim Cousins nor is it endorsed by him. In fact at the time of writing this he will never have even heard of it. All posts are by me and will publicise his parliamentary speeches, appearances in the press, useful links and other interesting tidbits. I'll try not to put any bias into anything I put up but I can't promise that. For the record I think Jim, from what I have read so far, has pretty similar political views to myself. I'm sure I'll find out for definite the more I update this site.   The blog's primary aim is to let his constituents see what he is up to, to find out if he is their ideal person to represent them and most importantly to make their views heard.   If the real Jim Cousins ever finds out about this blog he can have it, and the associated gmail address, as long as he keeps it up to date. How good an offer is that? Nice, easy to use way to get in touch with his constituents. For free. Come and get it Jim".   What a great idea.

      Arrived back from Leeds, where I've been attending a work-related conference since Sunday, late last night, after hours of patient, numbing travel. I refuse, however, to get upset about the state of the British railway system. I may as well get upset about the weather.   Travelling for work purposes is something I enjoy, generally, being a rare chance to escape my desk; it is also a golden chance to be taken seriously. There is something about arriving as a 'company representive' which apparently suggests gravity, whereas in truth as often as not you're simply there to stand behind, well, a stand.   I arrive back, meanwhile, to discover that Andrew, architect of the excellent Bedsit Bomber (both band and blog) has  urlLink remixed Assistant's new recording of 'A Century' , digging out and sculpting vocal snippets to create something completely new - a remix as a remix should be done, taking elements of the original and building up something original from it;  urlLink right click and download it here .

      A great, funny, difficult post over on Momus's Click Opera site.   urlLink Click opera - Shklovsky and me v. Heidegger and J-Lo    "My problem with the idea of authenticity as it manifests itself in contemporary pop culture -- I call this Rockism for short -- is that it's a conservative and convergent value. The basic tenets of Rockism are that it's good 'to stay in touch with your roots', 'to keep things real', 'to look in your heart and write', 'to thine own self be true', and so on. The emphasis is on the past, on convergence, on origins, and on necessity rather than on the future, divergence, destinations, and freedom"   And any article which links Heidegger to Jennifer Lopez is OK by me.

      At various stages in the last two or three months I've had posts planned on Reagan, Clinton and Bush and never finished any of them. All three are beguiling, frightening and amusing in their way; certainly it would have been possible for me to have posted two very different messages on each of them; the public rehabilitation of Reagan and (to a lesser extent) Clinton has been fascinating to say the least. Nightmarish thoughts abound as to how Thatcher will be remembered when she dies. Amongst the many stories I've read about Reagan recently (most of which have concurred with the new reading of him - that his methods and his diplomatic skill were gravely misjudged by his critics) the story I liked best was how he would alarm the Russians by earnestly explaining that, in the event of an alien attack, he saw them working together against the common enemy.   Most interesting about the nostalgic re-evaluation of his career is the implication that America (and the Western World) is suddenly hugely nostalgic for the days where American identity and security was - comparatively - a more straightforward matter. Communism was an enemy which may have galvanised America's collective aggression and fear but it elicited, especially under Reagan, a bold decisiveness, even if, in supporting the hotchpotch of dictators and bandits who resisted Russia ("my enemy's enemy is my friend"), the short and long term effects were catastrophic (although I concede, because it is in vogue, that the cold war was ultimately ended under Reagan). Under Reagan America seemed to have a common purpose (apart from get richer if you were rich or get poorer if you were poor). Bush may have gone after Saddam with the same eagerness to identify and destroy an 'enemy', but the people of America are gradually realising that the world is emphatically not a safer place for it. 270 injured in car bombs today.  Writing in yesterday's Guardian  urlLink David Aaronovitch  wrote, of Bill Clinton - who sought solace during the Monica Lewinsky scandal by reading the writings of Marcus Aurelius (a Roman emperor who shared Clinton's fondness for both affection and talking):  "There is no grandeur to be had now. These days Reagan is a great president, because these are not great days. They are messy and difficult and bloody, full of awful choices. It is no good blaming Bill because, as Marcus Aurelius himself said, real life is more like wrestling than dancing."

      Andrew links to the Observer  urlLink The 100 Greatest British Albums  list  urlLink in his BB blog today . I'm actually pretty unimpressed with the list, full of lazy, easy choices, but there's a lot there I own (more than Andrew, yay, I win), namely:  (I've colour coded them:  red if I think the record is genuinely one of the 100 best ever black if I think the record is good but wouldn't care if I never heard it again blue if I think the record is totally over-rated)   The Stone Roses , The Stone Roses;   London Calling , The Clash ;   Exile on Main St , The Rolling Stones ,   Blue Lines , Massive Attack ;   Metal Box , PiL ;  The Rise & Fall Of Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders From Mars , David Bowie;   The Clash , The Clash ;   Never Mind The Bollocks , The Sex Pistols ;   Club Classics vol 1 , Soul II Soul ;   The Specials , The Specials ;   Closer , Joy Division ;  Loveless , My Bloody Valentine;  The Smiths , The Smiths;   Piper At The Gates Of Dawn , Pink Floyd ;  Unknown Pleasures , Joy Division;   New Boots And Panties!! , Ian Dury And The Blockheads ,   Low , David Bowie ,  Lexicon of Love , ABC;   Bummed , Happy Mondays ;  Entertainment , Gang Of Four;   All Mod Cons , The Jam; ,  Village Green Preservation Society , The Kinks,   Cut , The Slits ;   Maxinquaye , Tricky ;   Power, Corruption and Lies , New Order ,   Screamadelica , Primal Scream ,   Quadrophenia , The Who ,   Original Pirate Material , The Streets ;   Parklife , Blur ,   Station To Station , David Bowie ;   Don't Stand Me Down , Dexy's Midnight Runners ;  This Nation's Saving Grace , The Fall;  Behaviour , Pet Shop Boys;   Boy in the Corner , Dizee Rascal ;  Dare , The Human League  Far more interesting than the list itself is the extracts from the voting, where pop luminaries explain their own personal top tens. Links to a few of these below:  Karl Hyde ( urlLink nominates Hawkwind! Has the world gone mad!?)  Terry Hall ( urlLink strangely conservative selection ) Tim Burgess ( urlLink nominates himself - good work Tim ) Stuart Maconie ( urlLink irritating use of capital letters, and incomprehsible choice at no. 1 )  Although, confusingly, there's another page with top tens on it where Terry Hall's rather dull version above is replaced by a much better and more original one:   1. Young Americans David Bowie 2. The Clash The Clash 3. Roxy Music Roxy Music 4. White Music XTC 5. Greatest Hits David Essex 6. Parklife Blur 7. Songs From the Bathtub Vol 1 Pete Boyle 8. Sheet Music 10cc 9. Modern Music Be Bop Deluxe 10. Pin Ups David Bowie   Of course, there's plenty missing from the main list (of which, more later) and, obviously  urlLink hardly any women  (honourable mentions for The Slits and Kate Bush aside). But, as ever,  urlLink Alex James has the last word , and, in nominating Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Adam and the Ants shows he has more sense than all the Stones/Beatles nominators put together. And, he points out, "making a list of best albums is itself a quaintly archaic notion", especially when the concept of 'album' is being stretched to its limit anyway.   "When vinyl went out of fashion it was already the beginning of the end. People can fiddle around with a CD and pick which tracks to listen to. And because the medium allowed it, albums became longer and longer. It's almost impossible to buy a new album now which you can enjoy in one sitting. The new album by the Streets is a brilliant exception. The last Blur album went on and on."   I guess it's inevitable that all this is leading up to me making my top ten. Hmm. I'll have to think about it.

      Like all England supporters, I'm really enjoying watching Wayne Rooney play at the moment, especially when - after an off-colour season - he's really playing the way we all hoped he would when he first broke through. But there's something I like about him even more - that boyish bashfulness. When he scores (plenty of recent occasions in which to observe this) his goal celebrations are wonderfully self-conscious - like Shearer in the way he just puts his head down, raises one arm and charges towards the corner flag (I'll exempt that worrying cart-wheel after his first goal against Switzerland - best leave that to slighter players), but he looks almost embarrassed when he does so, as though he can see the photographers looming. His face reddens, he breaks into a grin which seems to say 'I know - I can't quite believe this either'. It's funny to see this stocky, barrel chested man expose his youthfulness so candidly. I'm reminded of the teenage boy who suddenly becomes startlingly handsome (not something Rooney has had to deal with yet) and exhibits this knowledge with every fibre of his astonished being. Remember Prince William a year or three ago, all bashful grins, that trick of his mother's, looking up through his eyelashes. Now he looks like a horse so I guess he won't have to worry anymore.  Elsewhere,  urlLink more tales of barrel-chested genius  (gone astray).

      Sometimes you come across a blog which you know you can't compete with.  urlLink Random Acts Of Reality , by Reynolds, is such a blog. Superbly written, in turn horrific and moving, his daily account of life as an emergency paramedic in a London ambulance is really fascinating reading.   A brief quote, just to give you some idea...   I'm writing this on the move, once more towards occupational health, however for once it's not actually for me, but instead my crewmate. (He has a dodgy shoulder). The first job of the day was a classic early morning job, 87 year old male who had collapsed or fell last night (he didn't know which) and had spent the night laying on the bathroom floor. The first thing he said to me as I entered the room was "Hello, how are you?". Luckily he wasn't injured but we took him to hospital for a check-up anyway. His wife told us he was 87, "which is old for a man". What annoyed me was that these two lovely old folk were living in a group of flats that had a drug-dealer and prostitutes working out of. It doesn't seem like a nice retirement for a lifetime of work, and service in the army during World War II., but it's something we see time and time again.   There's plenty more, and much that is genuinely affecting. Read it.

       urlLink From the Guardian's New media diary... :    "Still on the subject of iTunes, which was launched at London's Billingsgate market in front of an admiring audience who lapped up every word of Steve Jobs's speech, most of those holes in the catalogue are down to the independent labels' refusal to play ball. Because the indies were offered worse terms than the majors, some of the hottest bands of the moment including Franz Ferdinand and the White Stripes are missing. Users of the service were quick to get the message across by subverting the iMix facility, which allows users to submit their own favourite mix CDs for approval by others. The top-rated selection shortly after launch last week was called 'iTunes needs indies!' and consisted of just one track - Money for Nothing by Dire Straits."

      A little out of date, but Michael Bull, a lecturer at the University of Sussex, is conducting some interesting research into iPod usage. Tempting though it is to get carried away by all this, does anyone else find it amazing quite how much significance people are affording the iPod? Not that it isn't a brilliant gadget, but weren't most people  already  starting to re-organise their record collections, burn their own CDs etc before the iPod's ubiquity was confirmed?   And is it really that very different, come to mention it, to the endless, endless hours of home taping that I used to do when I was a teenager? Being able to listen to the cream of my record collection in the order I choose is nothing new to me, I've been making myself (and friends) mix tapes for years.   urlLink Bulletin - University of Sussex Newsletter - iPod professor tunes into music on the move - 12th March 2004

      It's odd being vaguley directionless again, and it's perhaps a feeling we should fight against. Nevertheless, we've spent the last two months either working towards finishing our demo or preparing for the gig at the Freebutt. Now that we've done those two things and have nothing else imminent on the horizon we arrived at the rehearsal on Tuesday kicking our heels and wondering where to go.  But by the time we had set up our instruments Pete had worked out a rough, grungy riff and we started to play around with it, ending up with a loud, new-wavey stomp, sans vocals. Moving on,  Don't Ask Me  has been hanging around for ages and has had it's share of phases (Soul II Soul, Can, RRRRock, disco, reggae) - and we really need to get it organised. Fearing it all sounds too messy, Pete worked out a loud and brittle chorus; hopefully the variety should make the song easier to play. I promised to work on the lyrics this week, and I will. So far not much happens in that respect, the song hinging around the simplistic   "Don't ask me Where to go. I'm not ready to go".   which is hardly Leonard Cohen. It's hard to see quite how to fit it all together, but we had a nice progression going where it started with pounding, Can style drums and heavy guitars and melted into a hazy, Clash style stroll in the latter stages, so maybe we'll build on that. I sense a melodica riff beckoning...  The studio can get unbearably hot, and Brighton is baking at the moment. Suddenly it seemed irredeemingly stupid to be couped up in such a tight, warm space, so we went and sat outside by the harbour, dangling our feet over the wooden jetty and watching for jellyfish in the water. Andy reflused to volunteer any critisicm of the sting-happy species, and Ali was, I sensed, a bit put out. If ever there are organised jellyfish trials, or mass hangings of the "many-mouthed hunter" outside Hove Town Hall, I think Ali should be rounded up and questioned. I'm not saying he'd be behind it, I'm just saying he might know something. He is a man with a very low jellyfish threshold.  It reminded me of having a drink with Anne-Sophie, Sam  and Dan at the weekend. When all around were generally rubbishing spiders and running down their contribution to the vast web (ha) of life, Victoria refused to put the boot in. "But", Anne-Sophie said, as if trying to understand, "you  like  spiders?" as if one were either for or against them, as with marmite. For my part, I quite like spiders, too, as long as the size advantage remains in my favour.  Tramping back in, we decided to spend a bit of time glueing old songs together - the intro of  Broken  matched up with our bratty, BSP styled instrumental. Vaguely aware that we only had ten minutes or so left, we just bashed back and forth between the two parts until it was time to pack up. It sounded great. I wonder how many new songs we can cope with, given that we only tend to play six song sets, but doing new songs is exciting and fun, so...  I finally got my firewire cable through the post today, so I'm going to have a go at editing some of our video footage from the gig (and last night's rehearsal) tonight. May even be able to find somewhere to host a few clips...

      A really great site below; a lovely idea beatifully realised. Like a lot of people who grew up in London I don't feel the same starry affection for the place as a lot of people who were raised outside it, and for whom it was always exciting. I was pleased to move away to Brighton when I did. But the tube map I find impossibly fascinating, somehow, with its wonderful graphics, lop-sided geography and ability to  still  throw up unfamiliar station names after all this time. Similarly of all the yba art from a years back, Simon Patterson's   urlLink The Great Bear   was always one of my favourites, up there with Chris Offili and Sarah Lucas's best stuff. Anyway, take a look at the link below.   urlLink London Bloggers   I've actually got a real backlog of stuff I've recently read online which I want to link to; perhaps I'll put tomorrow aside as a links day. In addition to the site above, then, here are a couple of entertaining links to get started with.   - Two great responses to The Streets's still-sounding-fabulous 'A Grand Don't Come for Free' from Jakester and Tim - is it just me or has, for all the hyperbole lavished on Wiley and the Junior Boys, Mike Skinner's LP provoked by far the most intelligent, thoughtful and creative music writing online?   urlLink Jakester: The Uncertainty Principle    urlLink The Rambler: did I link to this post already? Maybe   - There have been some interesting interviews in the Guardian recently; the Kilroy-Silk one I mentioned earlier, and urlLink Zoe Williams' take on Robert Smith , which is interesting stuff even if you don't rate The Cure. Zoe Williams will write nine annoying articles out of ten without losing her breath, but occasionally she is spot on.   "It's not a control thing", Smith pleads. But Williams interjects -  "Oh, here we are again. It is! It doesn't mean it's a bad thing, but it bloody is a control thing. . Her involvement, her interest gives the article bite.  Elsewhere John Harris even makes  urlLink Paul McCartney  come over as an interesting subject and Hattie Collins pens an article which does the opposite for the usually dependable  urlLink Ice T.   Casting all the pop aside, there is a fascinating interview with  urlLink Clive Stafford Smith  in G2 today; Smith gave up a career in journalism for law and has defended hundreds of death row cases (remarkably, he has only lost on 6 occasions) and will shortly begin acting for 45 Guantánamo Bay detainees. He is a remarkable man.  urlLink    Lastly, and rather closer to home, I've been reading the blog of a fellow Brighton resident and Spurs fan over at the gratuitously named  urlLink 'The World is Full of Pisswits' . It is, and her blog is good reading - witty, intelligent and self-effacing. We're as one on Ledley King, and miles apart on Sarah Lucas...

      I haven't time to go into this in anything like the detail I would like to, but Sam draws my attention to the  urlLink 'Manifesto for a Sustainable Society' , which, given that I voted Green in the European elections, I really ought to have read already. It makes for interesting reading, although it does not contain too many surprises; idealistic statements on the environment which it is difficult to disagree with , fine words on transport, asylum and taxation, rubbish on Europe and the single currency, wonderful on the hereditory principle and the royal family - generally quite impressive, Europe aside. I need to read it in more detail, though.  For a quicker synopsis,  urlLink green is the new red , says Peter Tatchell. If the electoral success of UKip is anything to go by, the future of fringe parties could be directly allied to their success in finding a public figure who can express their principles succintly. The Guardian provided a revealing article on  urlLink the dreadful Kilroy-Silk , and more yesterday concerning  urlLink his role in the party's sudden success . As Michael Moore has long pointed out, if Oprah Winfrey stood for President of the United States she'd win with ease. Which makes me wonder quite how successful the Greens can be if the best they can do is  Peter Tatchell?

       "The arming of a man began at the feet and as far as possible each piece subsequently put on overlapped that beneath it. The arming of a man, therefore, was carried out in the following order; sollerets or sabatons, jambs, knee-cops, cuisses, skirt of mail, gorget, breast and back plates, brassards, pauldrons, gauntlets and, finally, the helmet."   Just finished reading William Boyd's  Armadillo , a very funny and very insightful book about the nature of identity, of disguise and of the conforming instinct, as well as much more besides. Characters lose and regain their names, are in turn fragile and secure, exposed and powerful. Milomre Blocj becomes Lorimer Black, who in turn shifts his appearance minutely from page to page. A collector of armour, he is at one point imprisoned in a £40,000 medieval helmet. At the hospital, it is sliced through as if it were stiff leather. At the book's close the text which surrounds this paragraph appears:   "Every living organism is seperated from its environment by a covering or integument, that delimits its body. It seems to me that the process of adding an extra integument is unique to our species and easily understandable - we all want extra protection for our soft and vulnerable bodies. But is it unique to our species? What other creature exhibits this same sense of precaution and seeks out this protective armour? Molluscs, barnacles, mussels, oysters, tortoises, hedgehogs, armadillos, porcupines, rhinos all grow their own. Only the hermit crab, as far as I can recall, searches for empty shells, of whelks or periwinkles, or indeed any other hollow object and crawls inside, to serve as shelter and protection of the body.  Homo sapiens  and  Euparagus bernhardus  - perhaps we are more closely related that we think. The hermit crab finds its suit of armour and keeps it on, but, as the crab grows, it periodically is obliged to leave its shell and travel the sandy undulations of the ocean floor, unprotected for a while, soft and vulnerable, until it finds a larger shell and crawls inside again."   There's lots of stuff on name-changing, which I find fascinating. I've gone through phases of hating my name (or rather, hating it's shortened versions) and have cycled through the alternatives; Jon, Jonny, Jonathan; for several years at secondary school I was Jo without an E, a name I no longer recognise if I hear it in the street (or rather, don't recognise it as my own). Having the luxury to make a decision in this sense is valuable, as valuable as putting on a piece of armour - an action which in turn can manifest itself in a posture, a pretence, a myth of our own making. Milomre Blocj, in Armadillo, adopts these poses because he wants his position in society, in life, to be  secure and without humiliation . But there are problems.   "The armoured man had proved that his suit of tempered steel could withstand the most powerful weapons in use, but in so doing he had discovered that the increase in the heaviness of the metal in which he clad his body produced a weight that became burdonsome in the extreme and, finally, insupportable."   So I'm plain Jonathan now, and even when I pick the armour up I recognise that before long I'll outgrow it and have to find something else - or take my chances without - like the hermit crab.    Armadillo.  1577 [-sp.  armadillo , dim of  armado  armed man, so lit. 'little armed man' :- L.  armatus , pa. pple. of  armare  ARM v.]

      Well, not entirely surprising that England lost, in the context of the two teams' overall ability. But still a thoroughly  galling  way to lose, so late in the day. Located some choice phrases of Gallic incredulity from the BBC 'French slang' page and texted them to an exultant Anne-Sophie. Think that confused her.  Faintly appalling, once again, to be at the end of a weekend, especially one which felt at times that it offered that precious thing;  enough time . Generally we went to bed late and rose early, meaning our days were long. Saturday felt like a Sunday. Yet now it is Sunday, late on a Sunday and all the time  I had  feels thrown away, because it's work again tomorrow and I'm still tired.   This is the way it is, though. Must sober up and go to bed.

      Andrew, over at his  urlLink Bedsit Bomber blog , is still digesting the results of the council elections, and musing on the Blair problem. Do we want rid of him now? After the election? At all? Michael Moore thinks he knows the answer, and has announced that his next film will concentrate on Blair's role in the Iraq war.    He likens Blair  "to an older sibling of Bush's"  and says that,  "as a parent, when two children get in trouble, the parent usually questions the older one as to how he or she could let such a problem occur".  Blair knows better, he says. Blair is not an idiot.  "So what is he doing hanging around with this guy?" . You can read more (well, essentially exactly what I've just re-hashed),  urlLink  here.    Andrew BB also maintains his excellent run of posts with another  urlLink dazzling piece of investigative journalism, here.    "Former Conservative leader, Sir Desmond Plummer," , Andrew writes, wholly falsely,  "was alleged to have ordered millions of oak saplings to be planted throughout working-class Bermondsey and Rotherhithe during the late 1960s. These would eventually have flourished, destroying the local housing and creating a forest teeming with fish, fowl, and game. Tory grandees would roam the open areas on horseback, hunting both cockney man and beast alike with hawks and spaniels.   European election results coming through tonight, of course, as well as the first England game of Euro 2004. Gonna stick my neck out for a 2-1 England victory, for no reason other than alien feelings of a rare rush of Englishness. Rooney and Owen to score. Yes, Anne-Sophie, you may use the comments boxes tomorrow to laugh at me if France thrash us. I reserve the right to edit your comments, however :-)  Someone left a football at our place last night after we had a few people back after a barbecue down on the seafront, so me and Vic strolled down to the beach for a kickabout earlier. I can report that she has fair-to-middling technique with an over-reliance on the toe-punt rather than the instep, yet her tactical astuteness and good looks secure her place in the Assistant starting eleven. And she's better at playing catch than me.  Right, off to the pub in a minute.

      There's an article in G2 today about Modigliani's nudes (his 'Reclining Nude' is below).

      Up early this morning to walk through the drizzle up to St. Marks church to vote. Funny to think that I only ever set foot in a church for two reasons; because I am on holiday (I always want to visit churches when I am away from home) or to vote. This morning the church hall was quiet (voter apathy or too early?) - the returning officer, looking bleary-eyed and shuddering out of semi-sleep, seeming rather surprised to see such early attendees. Voting still gives me, despite it all, the same peculiar mixture of pleasure and pride.  For those who have not yet exercised your democratic right, and - like me - found it very difficult to decide whom to vote for, the web throws up some useful links. Several sites, as Andrew has noted, make some effort to create interactive quizzes with the aim of attempting to pinpoint which party best represents the views of the voter. Sadly, I was unable to find anything which did so for the British electoral system, and it seems to me to be a resource which is badly needed. Elsewhere, one can encounter quizzes from  urlLink Holland  (the best and most detailed I encountered),  urlLink Canada  (of interest but less relevent) and the US (whose  urlLink The World's Smallest Political Quiz  is a model of economy, and the one that got the ball rolling).  The Guardian has attempted to confront the problem of voting Labour (or not wanting to vote Labour) in this election.  urlLink If you can't vote Labour, who can you vote for?  presents a variety of answers to the question with contributions from (amongst others)Michael Frayn, John Pilger and (talking rubbish) Tony Benn.   The Independent takes a more agressive stance than the Guardian, leading with "Mr Blair should suffer the electoral consequences of his calamitous war". Unfortunately (and ridiculously) I can't access this online without paying for it, so you'll have to read it in the newsagents during your lunch hour if you want that one :-)  Back in the Guardian, Polly Toynbee's article,  urlLink Would-be protest voters need to get a grip on reality  offers, as one would expect of a writer of her brilliance, a sensible and insightful argument for voting Labour today. For anyone undecided about which way to go it's essential reading - even if, in the end, I did not follow her advice .   Happy voting.   .

      Currently reading  urlLink 'High Tide: News From a Warming World'  by Mark Lynas, and really enjoying it - it's wonderfully clear and accessible on a subject I know very little about, and beautifully written; Lynas conjures some wonderful images.   He writes very movingly about the pacific island of Funafuti, part of Tuvula, which is one of the lowest-lying countries in the world, and which, due to rising oceans, is basically disappearing underwater. At the time of his writing the island had entered into an arrangement with New Zealand to start sending 75 people a year there - not exactly an urgent evacuation, but the long term prognosis is unequivocal. Within the next ten to fifteen years they will have to move.   Lynas meets Panapese Nelisone, who is touchy on the matter. Lynas writes   "As we finished the conversation, I made the mistake of using the word 'evacuation'. He broke in sharply: 'It's not an evacuation. We have not yet reached the stage where we must evacuate people. We know there is the threat of global warming, and the government doesn't want to sit back and do nothing. So this is a migration programme, a gradual kind of thing over time, not an evacuation as such, where we have to move people".   Lynas's descriptions are wonderful, and it is awful to think that in perhaps 30 years the Island will have dissapeared.    "Once the harsh sunlight began to soften a little, I wandered outside to explore. A hundred metres on my left was the lagoon, fringed by a narrow beach, the water mottled with purples and light blues where the sea floor alternated between sand and rock. A few women stood chatting in the water, only their heads showing above the rippled surface - looking as natural as old ladies passing the time of day at a London bus stop. Every now and then someone would heave themselves out of the sea fully-clothed, and set off, dripping, back to their house. I marvelled at their almost amphibious lifestyle - being wet or dry made little difference in this equatorial heat".      Aerial view of Funafuti Island, Tuvalu, May 2002 (Photo: Bob Girdo)    'My thinking',  says the former Prime Minister of Tavulu,  'is that now is the time for preparing a place so that when people move they can move with their traditions, their customs and their culture. Some people say no, no it won't happen - they don't believe in it. So I say, well, which one would you like - would you like to stay here and then every one of us will die and there will be no more Tuvaleans? Or that we prepare and move to another place where we can survive? ... But I want to stay on this Island, you know. I will go down with Tavalu. This is my thinking.'   Lynas tells a lovely story about Toaripi, met on the beach one day by some unsuspecting American squaddies who  "asked him to do their laundry, without realising that they were speaking to the country's Governer-General" . Of course, Lynas writes, he happily obliged.   Since Lynas's book was written the migration programme continues. Australia continues to refuse to help, or ratify the Kyoto agreement.  urlLink The most recent article I found on the subject is here    urlLink There is a rather more cheerful page on the Islands here,  from which the above photo was taken. Lynas's blog is at  urlLink http://www.marklynas.org

       Assistant  played our first gig in five months last night; long overdue but - from our point of view, at least - well worth the wait. It went really well. Debuting the new keyboard proved to be surprisingly straight-forward, and the Freebutt is, yes, a dark and dingy venue but also, conversely, a nice place to play. Making it most welcoming was a good turnout from the assistantees, including Victoria, Sam, Andrew, Sarah, Mark, Ruth, Dan, Natalia, Benedict, Poppy, Dave (who won the long-distance award) and several other people I either didn't recognise, recognised but didn't know, or recognised, knew, got on like a house on fire with and - today - have temporarily forgotten. Still, that's the kind of thing the comments boxes are here for, if there are more names due a thanks.  On first, we played six songs from about half eight onwards, although the set came in surprisingly close to a mere twenty minutes; once again when you play live it's hard rationing the tempo. Not a problem though.  You Should Know  opened the set, as is customary, and remains one of our best songs. Following that we had the triumverate of new songs, which we were finding a bit daunting in recent rehearsals. All three were near-perfect on the night however,  I'm Shit  sounding energetic and buoyant,  Drinking With You  rather harder and taut, and  What It Means , sandwiched between the two, probably the most ambitious song we've attempted live; lots of stops, twists and turns, but it's my  favourite  now. You can  urlLink download it on MP3 here  (as indicated in this morning's message). The final two tracks are older numbers, but usually elicit the best responses of our set -  Vine to Vine  and  Easy To Leave  - and both went really well last night. If I was feeling confident (which I am) I'd tell you that neither me nor Pete will ever mess our guitar lines up on those two songs again. But perhaps I shoudn't tempt fate.  Much of the next half hour was spent standing outside (where it was still light!) scrutinising the video which Andrew BB ( Bedsit Bomber , not Big Brother) had kindly filmed for us (and from which the MP3 derives), to the amusement of the guy on the door, who entertained us with stories of anti-Freebutt vendettas from the flats opposite, and who looked fairly non-plussed watching the footage.   Back inside I prepared myself to be unimpressed by  My Device , and conceded defeat as their set spiralled upward as they went on; they were really excellent, like Guy Piciotto's Fugazi rather than Ian McKaye's - and interesting rhythms and vocals to boot. Andy got quite excited at one song which - he told me twice - apparently just went "aiaiaiaiaiaiiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiai". Or something like that. There are some demos to download from  urlLink My Device's website , and they've got CDs to buy too. See them live, though - they're great. Highly recommended from someone who doesn't care if he never sees another 'rock' band again.   My Tour of Duty  have a  urlLink CD to promote too , and that's what the evening was about. I missed their first few tracks and wandered round ten minutes in, and was delighted by what I saw; like an even match between the off-beat pop of XTC and the pop-punk of the much maligned (but initially ace) Superchunk. Their songs are called things like 'Love is Torture' and they're fronted by a big, shaggy haired lovely great Andy Partridge; all hesitations, quiet smiles and funny ideas.

Went to see the spiky and fun  urlLink Ikara Colt  at Po Na Na in East Street last night; what a curious venue that is ( "Thanks for coming to see us play at Po Na Na Curry House" , the singer deadpanned,  "We hope you enjoyed your meal" ). I.C were on form, starting relatively muted but whipping themselves up as the set progressed; by the end they were sharp and invigorating, blending N.O.U / Huggy Bear type energy (they really recalled the latter when the guitarist chipped in on vocals) with the taut post-punk stylings of Joy Division and, particularly, The Fall.    "Smash the place up" , they suggested, when the lighting and the wooden fittings got on their nerves.  "I'll take the rap, I don't give a fuck" , their singer said. But he's not Mark E Smith (or even Kevin Shields, who once kicked off a mini-riot at a MBV gig when he suggested the same thing) and couldn't help smiling. Nor could we.

       B  L  U  R   have   started   work   on   the   follow-up   to   ’THINK TANK’ .  The group have been in the studio this month, and are planning on going back in again after the summer to work on more songs.  Drummer Dave Rowntree told XFM: "We’ve done a week or so recording, and we’ll do another couple of weeks, I think in September. There’s no deadlines we’ll just chip away, like we did with the last one. It’s sounding very good.  "The basis of the record is Damon’s ‘Democrazy’ album so anyone who listens to that will have a good headstart on what we’re doing. That’s the basis, so some of those tracks will end up being on the record. No working titles yet though, no it’s far to early for all that rubbish. This is the fun bit where you don’t have to worry about ridiculous working titles."

      Never got round to plugging one of the better books I've read on the subject of politics and Iraq;  Picking The Bones  by Geoffrey Regan. The brief review which I wrote for  urlLink the Amazon site  is reproduced below. For anyone who is interested in the historical precedents and parallels in Bush and Blair's 'crusade', it's essential reading.   "The political influence, democratic soundness and wisdom of waging war in Iraq by George Bush and Tony Blair has provoked a seemingly endless stream of comment, debate, and books. But 'Picking The Bones' takes a different approach to the likes of 'Dude, Where's My Country' and 'Weapons of Mass Deception' by examining the way in which political rhetoric has exploited a revisionist and highly selective kind of history in order to justify war.  America is, we are told, 'land of the free', 'where all man are created equal'. Yet America's history is awash with bloodshed, tainted by racism, and shamed by slavery. When Americans talk about freedom, what do they mean? Native and African Americans, the people of Hiroshima, Vietnam, the Philippines and Grenada (not to mention Iraq) have all been on the receiving end of America's military might and suffered from the savagery of war. Some, it seems, are more equal than others. Regan points to British atrocities too, skewers the myth that the French are 'cheese eating surrender monkeys' and demonstrates with remarkable clarity the historical precedents for America's 'War on Terror'.   If the book has a failing it is that it provides what feels like a surfeit of information; as the book progresses Regan demonstrates countless war crimes, lies, and double standards to the point where the reader reels from the facts. But when the author, at the book's close, nails American history as American myth-making, he makes his point astutely, having already given more than enough examples to back himself up.   This rhetorical power aside, he writes wittily and accessibly, with much evident enjoyment, articulating the threat which America, as much as any of Bush and Cheney's 'Axis of Evil', poses to world stability. His book is the historian's counterpart to Graham Greene's description of The Quiet American, who is "as incapable of imagining pain or danger to himself as he [is] incapable of conceiving the pain he might cause others".

      Apologies for ripping  urlLink Private Eye  off so shamelessly, but there was a wonderful moment on ITV's  The Vault  last night.  Melanie Sykes: "What is the term used to describe constant worrying over real or imagined symptoms?" Contestant 1: "Homophobia" (cue much audience laughter). Melanie Sykes: "Afraid not. Anyone else?" Contestant 2: "Munchausen's syndrome?"    urlLink K-Punk  links out to a  urlLink fascinating article by Abe  on the culture of mix-tapes in US Hip Hop; a really interesting feature and something I didn't know about. I've listened to some of Ghostface's new 'Pretty Toney' album and it's wonderful; the idea that there are tons of superior songs floating around is exciting. Accordingly, I downloaded his  My Guitar  last night and Abe is right: it's stunning.  Rather tremendously, I just found that when the Wu-Tang were in Brighton a couple of weeks ago they stayed in a rather hip Brighton hotel which is notable, amongst other things, for being next door to our flat. The idea that the entire Wu (or those of them who made it over to England) were no more than twenty metres away from me just the other day is, frankly, mind-boggling.

New Order -  Technique LP (this was never my favourite New Order LP. I can't think why. It is now).  3. Inifinite Livez - Bush Meat LP (really excellent UK Hip Hop)  4. Radio 4 - Party Crashers (nothing particularly striking about this, except that it does everything it's supposed to)  5. Shystie - One Wish (Really excellent; I've only heard this once or twice and it sounded brilliant. Need to hear it again)

      According to the NME and Peter Hook, Jude Law is being lined up to play Ian Curtis in a bio-pic of the Joy Division lead singer.       The film will be based on Deborah Curtis's book  urlLink Touching From a Distance.  I find it odd to think that such a film is being made; Curtis's enigmatic appeal is certainly not hard to appreciate yet&nbsp;the idea that Hollywood would deem Joy Division an attractive subject... it's strange.   What appeals most, however, is the concept that the other players in the late 1970s music scene are likely to feature too; how wonderful and surprising it is to think that  urlLink A Certain Ratio  will have been portrayed in two separate and (presumably) widely-seen movies!? Would  urlLink Vini Reilly  ever have imagined that one day a pasty-faced Hollywood actor would be clutching a guitar and pretending to be him? Great.    urlLink Hollywood star to play tragic Joy Division singer? - NME.COM

       urlLink no singing, no dancing northern white crap samples back   Magnificent! Well spotted  urlLink Tim , whose blog points me in the direction of  urlLink The Architectural Dance Society  and the author's marvellous approximation of The Fall - cobbled together entirely from cut up and pasted spam messages and samples from Fall-related songs. Excellent stuff.

      One of the downsides of allowing yourself to be interviewed by someone who  isn't  a music journalist, and is thus not cravenly beholden to the 'rock star' myth, is that you open yourself to be  urlLink stitched up and exposed as a fool , as Johnny Borrell no doubt discovered when he opened up Laura Barton's hilarious interview with him in the Guardian this morning. Not that it isn't his own fault.   For those who have somehow missed Mr. Borrell, lead singer of insipid indie hopefuls Razerlight, he has recently encountered some success with his band's debut album, and has  let it go to his head  somewhat, proclaiming himself a kind of Charles Dickens-Bob Dylan for the twenty-first century. Well, for those of us who still pick up a copy of the NME in the library every now and again and are inured to the silly, hyperbolic things that 'rock stars' say, this isn't too shocking - grand declarations of genius are all too common in the world of conservative indie rock, and the quotes are normally accompanied by the kind of journalism that is just impossible to take seriously - witness the recent fawning over Pete Doherty and this beloved (coughs violently) 'Albion'. For example, has anyone ever heard a Libertines record which is anywhere near as enjoyable as reading one of their ridiculous, self-aggrandising interviews?   Yet having somehow captured the attention of a large group of people (I wonder why no-one else noticed that their was a Richey Manic shaped hole in modern pop), Doherty does at least have some claim to influence. Borrell is stumbling in his wake. And he may be a nice looking chap, but that doesn't make the following statements any cleverer.    "Y'know, I could've been a poet," he swaggers, "but I've never seen anyone perform poetry and been anything other than bored out of my head. Cos it's a dead art form, you know? The whole point of Razorlight is to get something that means something and has some artistic merit coming out of your speakers in three minutes. That's why movies work. It's a shame theatre can't do that, but it can't."    Before I continue, I'll just take a moment to reproduce a little verse; I'll leave it up to you to work out whether this is from the pen of Johnny Borrell or Philip Larkin. See if you can work it out...    "Six in the morning and you rise and you fall, you got to  You got to grab what you can  Here comes your man, baby, he's a winner, yeah  He's a gunslinger"    Right.   An excellent writer (and rather a better poet than Borrell, I'd hazard a guess) like Laura Barton could rip this chap to shreds. Instead, she lets him do the talking while slyly poking a little fun at him along the way.  The newfound pin-up status rests awkwardly on his bony shoulders , she writes, moments before allowing him to observe that  "If I saw me I'd want to speak to me, too - I'd think, 'That guy looks like he's from Mars, he's somehow strangely compelling. I don't even look human".  Borrell, needless to say, looks exactly like the lead singer of every post-Strokes indie band in the Western world.   Like the Libertines, Razorlight trade heavily on faux-romantic london imagery.  He spies London's charm in some unlikely corners, however, waxing about "the dirt on the streets, King's Cross, the feeling of having no money, waiting for the night bus and not getting on the night bus, arguing with the driver and having to walk home."  Sigh. How is this different to Brett Anderson's vision of early 90s London? Clue - it isn't. And it's a lot less thrilling, too. If the likes of Razorlight and The Libertines' boring rhetoric has a like-minded antescedent it isn't Charles Dickens or The Clash (some hope) it's the pissy, cliche-ridden period of mid-Britpop mod revivalists, it's Thurman's  "Oh, wouldn't it be nice / To drink some English Tea?"  And musically, of course, Razorlight are just anaemic, sub-Strokes tosh.   Of course, that's not why I wrote this - I could single out any number of dreary, unimaginative indie boy-bands for abuse, but rarely do so;  whatever . But it takes an idiot like Burrell, proclaiming loudly that rock music is a 'valid art form' (uh, where have you been for the last forty years, we all agreed on that  decades  ago!), recycling all that tired crap about driving a motorbike "as fast as I can", tapping into "your mojo", and then having the ignorance to say of your songwriting process:  "It's like Borges ... when he wrote The Zahir and I."  Ahem.   So. That got my goat.   I feel better now.

       It is, perhaps, a sign that my heart is not really in it today that I have spent the last half hour pre-occupied with a spider that has decided to make my desk his home - he is a confident fellow; one minute merrily preparing a web from the side of my monitor to the desk divider, the next crawling over my screen, as if each letter I add to the back cover copy I'm writing is an insect he might trap. In fact, should any fly be unlucky enough to get caught in  my  spider's web, I fear he will not have too much too worry about. Bold he may be. Bigger than a crumb, he is not.  Looking away for a while I got a bit of shock to discover, when I looked up, that he had apparently decided to make my face the next stop on his ever expanding web, and was chugging along towards me, about two inches from the safety of my forehead. Needless to say, I resisted. I am a friend of spiders, yes, but I draw a line at being made their home - that's a step too far. That said, perhaps now is a good time to ask  how? . I'm sure people have explained to me in the past how spiders make their webs but  how had he got so near to my face?  Upon what had he attached himself? Me?   So, schoolboy stuff - I've not yet named my eight-legged chum, and will happily name him after the first person who can use the  urlLink comment box below  to explain how spiders get their web spun across from Point A (my monitor) to Point B (my head).  Meanwhile, any more exciting spider action and you'll be the first to know.   &nbsp;

      It was Andrew's birthday on Friday, so we went and had a celebratory dinner in Hove's  urlLink Corianders , which, despite sounding like an Indian takeaway, is in fact a flashish and hard-to-find restaurant serving Mediteranean and North African cuisine. Unfortunately situated beyond the main run of shops on Church&nbsp;Road (and, we marvelled, how nice it is down there and so many nice looking places to eat; we increasingly refuse to budge out of Kemptown), it took a bit of perseverance to get to, and when we eventually found it in a run down parade of shops down to the sea, it didn't look too promising.   But inside, the decor was appealing; slightly dishevelled, far from ornate, but containing several attractive artifacts and - oddly - a very western, very average line of paintings on the wall, as well as two lovely round tables, tiled with mosaics. We sat elsewhere, however, by the door, and ordered wine and an excellent starter to share; a salad comprising of avocado, tomato and smoked haloumi (a minty, white cheese from Cyprus, it says here) in a 'corn tortilla bowl', which was excellent.   Priced a little high (most main courses between 13 and&nbsp;18 pounds and, shamefully, rather more expensively than the online menu suggests) the restaurant obviously prides itself on its character. A little testily, the nevertheless personable waitor explained that we could not order our starter and main course seperately, it must be done together, and besides, "you'll have a long wait between courses anyway", he told us proudly. He was right, and the wait was a touch excessive, but when the main course arrived it looked impressive. Gossiping that the advantage of eating outside the normal, town-centre haunts (pizza express, thai, blind lemon alley) was the varied menus, we boasted that eating in Corianders meant you got food you wouldn't ordinarily eat.   That said, Andrew aside, we went for the more predictable meals; roast chicken with a side serving clump of corn stuff (my technical term) and black-bean stew for Vic and Pete, and a lamb, saffron and date tagine for myself, coming with cous-cous and a cucumber and mint yoghurt sauce. Only Andrew was more daring, going for Ostrich steak (I forget what it came with, roast potatoes I think) and giving it an enthusiastic thumbs up. He was right, I nicked a bit and it was good, kind of like chicken breast in texture and roast beef in taste. It looked super, too; we were all surprised, ignorant as we are, to see that it was a red meat.   Polishing off the last scraps and the dregs of the wine, we decided on our desserts - Vic and Andrew sharing a rich chocolate truffle cake and Pete plumping for a creme brulee; a creme brulee which, unfortunately, was neither burnt enough on top for my taste (I nicked a bit) nor, more damningly, very nice - it was excessively sweet, lacking that bitter aftertaste which good brulee's have. Never mind. My dessert, meanwhile, was magnificent - seduced by the promise of a chilli flavour I had gone for a selection of ice creams and sorbets; something mild and fruity, a capuccino ice cream which I liked (and I hate coffee) and the piece de resistance, the chilli ice cream itself. Now, surprisingly, this worked absolutely perfectly; nothing shocking or gimmicky, just a lovely, cool ice cream with a tingling, memorable aftertaste. Really wonderful. Kind of thing I could eat all day.   Oddly, despite the slightly over-priced menu (my lamb, while very pleasant, was nothing remarkable and pricy at £17.00 while Vic's chicken, despite looking magnificent, was not that full flavoured below skin level), the overall meal didn't come in that pricy; just over a hundred pounds for four of us (one starter, four main courses, two bottles of wine and three desserts - with lots of nice bread and olives thrown in for free); just over 25 pounds a head, which was better than I expected.   Unfortunately, I get the feeling that the location of this restaurant is probably its biggest drawback. Despite an adventurous menu and attractive decor, the place was never busy on a clear, bright summer's Friday night. Placed half a mile East, or situated on Church&nbsp;Road it would doubtless do a roaring trade. As it was, it was a really nice place to spend an evening. And as we left a group of diners, situated on one of those lovely tiled tables, were delivered their main course; and I saw I  should have had the lobster .... it looked great.   All in all a good meal in nice surroundings. Recommended.

      good lord, it's easy to please some people.    "Next year's third and final instalment of the "Star Wars" prequels will be called "Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith," the film's producers have said.   The name was unveiled on Saturday for 6,500 comic-book fans at the 35th annual Comic-Con International in San Diego. Many in the audience  jumped out of their seats, thunderously screaming in joy . Some even gave one another hugs."    Who can blame them?  Elsewhere in the (ahem) news, revelations that the captive Saddam Hussein has developed a penchant for horticulture and&nbsp;American foodstuffs lead to the headline 'Muffin-muncher Saddam loves gardening' on Yahoo! Is it just me or does that sound like it should be accompanied by a photo-shoot in  Heat , where Saddam is&nbsp;snapped leaning&nbsp;lazily on his spade, gorging himself on a cake. A boxed picture to the right shows the disgraced dictator in leaner shape during his capture;  Saddam,  we're supposed to think,  you've let yourself go.

      Robert Wyatt, creator of perhaps the best album on a fairly predictable Mercury shortlist (Franz Ferdinand, Belle and Sebastian, The Streets, the hideous Keane, Amy Winehouse, Wyatt, Basement Jaxx, the excellent Ty, Joss Stone, The Zutons, Snore Patrol and Jamelia) has declared that it would be a 'disgrace' if he won the award. He says...   "Others who have been shortlisted - Amy Winehouse, Basement Jaxx, Belle & Sebastian - are far more deserving. I'm in just to keep the contest broad."

Popular stars who incurred the wrath of the deranged former road-sweeper - including Gita, 'Lofty', and Clyde Tavernier - found themselves expelled from the soap and ostracised from their former friends[:] victims of Fowler's insane ego, sacrificed and eaten at the climax of stomach-churning ceremonies in which drug-crazed, pagan drummers (possibly including Ian Beale, alias real-life actor, Adam Woodyatt) aroused Walford residents in a crescendo of evil.   I think we all  suspected &nbsp; that something similar was going on...

       On after us,  urlLink The Carolgees  were an odd lot; opening with a dense, heavy blend of keyboards and bass and a light, vocodered vocal they seemed at first to have more interest in Daft Punk than guitar music, but their set evolved into a vaguely eclectic set of ambitious indie rock with dense guitars, samples and rich keyboards; more sound on stage than it seemed likely they could produce. Oddly introducing their most conventional and least ambitious song as their new single, they had much more to offer than its plaintive melody; occasionally some great bass playing brought New Order to mind and the vocal interplay towards the end of the set recalled the comparatively cheerful, winning pop side of mid-period The Cure, echoing synths and high, impassioned voices. During that last song, and a few places elsewhere, they were really good.    urlLink Girlinky  play better each time we see them. Visibly wilting in the heat but not letting it effect the songs, they played a cracking, breezy set of bright, snappy punk-pop. The third band of the night (counting Grande Cobra and ourselves) to take the stage with an excessively cheerful drummer and somehow getting him through it without melting, missing a beat or even a high note (he sings as well as plays), Girlinky blend whizzing synths with stroppy guitars and some great tunes. The new single,  Newspaper Round  has been a permanent feature on my iTunes playlist since I first heard it a year or so ago and live it is really excellent, Sarah and Rob's vocals bouncing off eachother while Chris, er, bounces round the stage, falling into the audience in a moment of delirium. Later, during the bonkers finale to  It's Not Cold In The Snowglobe , a new song which builds up from icy electronics to seething punk, his strap becomes detached from his guitar and, unable to fix it back on, he reasonably decides to carry on with his guitar dangling vertically from his wrist, before deciding just to bounce it up and down on the ground as Scott launches himself into the drumkit and brings the whole thing crashing down. Somewhere along the way my foot gets comprehensively trodden on and will hurt for a couple of hours, but it's a small price. Girlinky are great.

      Two things following on from my post about  urlLink Nanowrimo  last week; firstly, having jabbered on about it to a few people and noted their aghast expressions ("50,000 words in  one month!?" ), I feel compelled to direct the reader on to the following quote from an FAQ on the Nanowrimo site.  &nbsp;    "Did you know there is a group in Vancouver that writes novels in a weekend?  Yes, and they are fools. Everyone knows that any deep and lasting work of art takes an entire month to make"    Well, quite.   Elsewhere, and more seriously, I remembered reading an article in The Guardian a while back about  urlLink self-publishing and the new opportunities  offered by print on demand technology, and it seems relavent in relation to the above, despite the notion of 'vanity' publishers being a well-publicised black hole. Nevertheless,  urlLink Publish and Be Damned  offer a bespoke publishing service which is unique for being straight-forward and good value. In essence, the principle is this; you send them a ready-to-print manuscript (in other words, your freshly completed Nanowrimo novel) and they print you a copy which you, or indeed anyone, can purchase. The only condition on your part is that you buy ten copies at £6.99 each.   There doesn't seem to be any other catch, other than the fact that you'll have to send 6 copies to the British Library System (or 2 if you're reading this in the States) and that, if you want to sell it commercially, you need to purchase an ISBN. But it's a wonderful idea. So if you fancy writing a novel in November in time for publication for Christmas...   Pete had the great idea that each one of Assistant should write a Nanowrimo novel and when it comes to releasing an Assistant record it'll come accompanied by the latest novel by your favourite member. Now  that's  what I call a concept album.

       The gig was excellent, and the Spice of Life was outrageously hot. We arrived, via train and bus, at the venue at around 5.30 (actually in two groups, ten minutes apart, as when we tried to disembark from the back of the bus outside the venue half of us made it and half didn't - me, Vic and Pete getting whizzed on to Bloomsbury while the others, presumably, laughed) and met up with  urlLink Girlinky , who were soundchecking a brilliant sounding and ambitious new song (which later closed their set). Moving upstairs for a drink and a curiously nerve-free pre-gig chat, we met up with the loyal and - frankly - beleagured Assistant fanbase (cough), some of whom had followed us all the way up from Brighton (Andrew, James, Becky - thanks), others from North London and, in the case of Anthony, who I spent just about every day with from age 4-12, direct from my past. A pleasure to meet Brin, too.   Eventually soundchecking, we dashed through  What It Means  and an almost-abortive run through the always difficult  Engines and Anvils  while the venue filled up around us, struggling in the heat already (jacket on, jacket off). Billed as the first band of three we discovered to our delight that we were in fact the second of four! Hurrah; our inexorable rise up the bill continues. First on were  urlLink Grande Cobra  (thanks Sarah), who played five short, extremely sharp and enthusiastic songs of a brittle, garage rock nature which I may otherwise shun. They were good, though, combining great bass lines, impassioned yelps and skilful footwork (toes in, toes out).  By the time we got on stage it was hotter still (jacket off) and our first song, as yet untitled but described here previously as 'the instrumental, BSPish one' was over in an instant. Watching the video back (Andrew filmed it for us) Pete displays some canny guitar heroics by improvising his way around the fact that I played the second verse in completely the wrong key. Never mind.  You Should Know  is an angry blur, played fast and loud with me jigging up and down on the spot and feeling hot and crazy. I tried to move about more this time, conscious that we sometimes appear static, and made some wonderful guitar errors in the process, but it was worth it. For a start I felt more involved, quicker. It seems funny to say that you can sometimes feel uninvolved when you're on stage, but it's true; sometimes songs skip by unnoticed. Not this time, though.   The triumverate of new(ish) songs,  I'm Shit ,  What It Means , and  Drinking With You  went off without much in the way of hitches; during the former the abrupt stop after the middle eight brought a few cheers, which pleased me, and  What It Means  saw Ali recklessly tossing drumsticks around and not missing a beat; there's a great bit in the video when, moments later, he pauses, looks at Pete and gives a sheepish thumbs up. I'll have to see if I can grab a still of that. During  Drinking With You  I dashed over to Anne Sophie, intent on playing a duet with her and dumbly started playing the wrong (ie, turned off) keyboard. Ah well. Meanwhile, Pete wonders whether his guitar will melt in the torrent of so much sweat from the arm/hand area? It works out OK.   Vine to Vine  and  Easy To Leave  almost seem like old hat now, but I continue to love playing the former (I do so little I can afford to drink a little beer, re-arrange my hair) and the latter just sounds  ace  when I get the guitar part right (I did), off-beat and melodic. By this stage the heat had become almost too-much, yet also appropriate. I threw myself around a bit more. Looking into the crowd, Vic looked a bit embarrased. Sorry V.&nbsp;Afterwards, Pete asks me to&nbsp;point out that it is at this stage that he is beginning to&nbsp;rue not having his hair cut, as skull surface temperature reaches critical.   Engines and Anvils  remains our most exciting song. Having played it (or planned to play it) several different ways, the current method is for me, Anne-So and Pete to play over Ali and Andy's exacting template, pre-recorded and routed through the mixing desk on CD. It makes playing it faintly odd; I turn and see Ali packing away his cymbals, are we still playing? Oh, yes, of course we are. I try to concentrate, but I'm still giggling at the rhythm section high five at the end of  Easy to Leave . The songs builds up and builds up, Pete's guitar line chattering with feedback at the song's close. My melodica sounded lovely. I'm concerned, right now, that I am slipping into writing in footballer's tense ("he brings the ball up the flank and crosses and I just twatted it", etc). Never mind.   We leave the stage knackered, hot and happy, and people look like they enjoyed it. Ah.   I'll get round to blogging the other bands in a bit....

      Just preparing a few CDs for the gig tonight; it's really hard deciding which tracks to go with, especially when the songs I really want to include are our new ones and are, so far, unrecorded. Never mind - am burning You Should Know, Vine to Vine, Freaks and Easy to Leave. If anyone would like a CD tonight make sure you collar myself, Pete, Andy, Anne-So or Ali, and we'll get you one. Will bring along a book for anyone's details if they want anything else, from CDs of old songs or live videos to inclusion on our fabled mailing list.   Just in case you missed venue details: tonight we are playing The Spice of Life in Cambridge Circus, London; doors open at 8. We'll be there from about 5 onwards.

      An interesting article on the Guardian website today  urlLink about the paper's direction and reach  - and their intentions regarding format. I'm not a fan of the tabloid version of the Independent (much less the Times) and was rather hoping that the Guardian would resist this fashionable change, rather as  urlLink Roy Greenslade  has been intimating in his media columns. Well, they have, after a fashion, as the article below makes clear that they will not adopt the tabloid format. They will, however, move  "to the midi shape of some of the leading European papers, such as Le Monde and La Repubblica, which is considered a more modern and better-shaped receptacle for the Guardian ethos".    Hmmm.&nbsp;Elsewhere, today's Guardian carries  urlLink an interesting little piece about King Tubby .

The book explores the experience of a Jewish-American family as aviation hereo Charles A Lindbergh beats Roosevelt to the presidency in 1940 and promptly negotiates an "understanding" with Adolf Hitler  and   Sue Townsend: Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction   Michael Joseph, h/b, £16.99, October  The latest installment of Adrian's life, with Adrian now a 38-year-old single parent and war starting against Iraq.  Wow, can't wait for either.

      Been setting up some social bookmarking for the last couple of days, using del.icio.us, a superb tool for storing and tagging interesting web stuff. With the odd exception I won't use it to link to blogs or commercial web-sites, but instead to articles of interest and oddities I link to within my blog itself.  Click here to view my bookmarks:  urlLink     At the moment it's mostly populated with articles I've dredged out of my archives, so there's not that much new stuff. There's plenty to read there which is interesting, nonetheless. Will try to add some more current stuff as I uncover it.

       urlLink Nanowrimo  encourages people to do something that, without a bit of encouragement, they would never get round to doing. Namely, write a novel. Knowing that we all have an epic lurking unwritten somewhere beneath the service, the group (NaNoWriMo is an abbreviation of National Novel Writing Month) preaches a strict doctrine. In their words,    National Novel Writing Month is a fun, seat-of-your-pants approach to novel writing. Participants begin writing November 1. The goal is to write a 175-page (50,000-word) novel by midnight, November 30.  Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over talent and craft, NaNoWriMo is a novel-writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved.   Because of the limited writing window, the ONLY thing that matters in NaNoWriMo is output. It's all about quantity, not quality. The kamikaze approach forces you to lower your expectations, take risks, and write on the fly.   Make no mistake: You will be writing a lot of crap. And that's a good thing. By forcing yourself to write so intensely, you are giving yourself permission to make mistakes. To forgo the endless tweaking and editing and just create. To build without tearing down.   Speaking as someone who has tried on several occasions to write a novel but inevitably been sidetracked by beer, work, books and the kind of ambitiousness which leads you down blind alleys of endless tweaking and re-writing, I think this is a really refreshing idea. It gives you that bit more freedom to not worry about consistency or accuracy and instead concentrate on getting something written. One can always go back and edit later, after all.   When the challenge was first run in 1999 only six writers limped past the finishing line. Last year 3500 managed it, so it's clearly not impossible. Most appealingly, it imposes a kind of disclipline on the writer, something that most people I know, now in their mid twenties and five years having passed since they wrote their dissertations or revised for exams, have not experienced in a long time. And may not want to again, granted. But it's only a month, and it's a great idea. And maybe we need to be  made to do it , after all this prevarication.  The site boasts a suppportive forum with plenty of support and encouragement, and participants arrange local meet-ups to discuss their progress. There's even a section where you can take your ailing story to a 'plot-doctor' who'll get you back on the straight and narrow.  It has, too, I guess, enormous potential for bloggers,  urlLink if one is not already tired of the concept of a 'blog-novel' . Yes,  urlLink Plain Layne , I'm looking at you.   Well, perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it, as now it looks like I'm promising to do it. If I never mention it again (or worse, never mention it again after blogging enthusiastically for the first couple of days in November) just now that I tried, really I did, I tried.  Registration starts on October 1. Let's do it.

       "I wonder if you can help me,"  asked Aladair Maughan, a Guardian reader writing into the Guardian's regular football feature,  urlLink The Knowledge .  "I remember reading about a match being played in an African cup competition (I think) where both teams were trying to score own goals in order to try to make/try to prevent the game from going into extra time and being won on a golden goal. Does anyone know the exact details of this, or if it's just an urban myth?"   The Knowledge replies as follows. Apologies to those who care not for football. I hope this is amusing enough to warrant a long quote - I think so.   It might sound like an urban myth, Alasdair, but it's (almost) 100% true. The crazy events you describe took place in a Shell Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada in 1994.   Going into the last group game, Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals to qualify for the final stages. Anything less and Grenada went through. So far, so simple. Except that the organisers had decided that, in the case of extra time, a golden goal would count as two goals.   You don't have to be Einstein to work out what happened next. Barbados raced to a 2-0 lead before Grenada made it 2-1 with seven minutes remaining. The Bajans were heading out unless they scored a goal; any goal.   Fortunately for them, with three minutes left, they did just that - only not in the right net. Their deliberate own goal made it 2-2 and propelled the game towards extra time.   Now, farcically, Grenada needed to score a goal (at either end) to go through.  Cue frantic defending of both penalty areas by Barbados until the final whistle .   Maybe it's just me, but I  love  that idea. You can read more on the same game at the link above.

      An excellent  urlLink article in the Guardian today  by Julian Baggini, editor of the Philosopher's Magazine, entitled 'What Are Men Complaining About?'   "Ladies" , he begins,  "start peeling your onions for the modern man. This poor confused creature is no longer afraid of tears, especially if they are neither his own nor shed in public. And if you want to know why you should cry for him, just look around at what is happening as we speak."   Of course, the modern man, as Baggini shows, has not got it so very bad after all. Writing on the same morning (did they compare notes?),  urlLink Polly Toynbee  pours scorn on tory plans to capitalise on the growing movement for father's rights.   "They are right that mothers should be forced to comply with access orders. But Michael Howard, grasping at any passing hot cause, wants courts to grant automatic equal rights to fathers. However, children are not chattels: ask King Solomon. Courts must always put the child's interests first. Until some distant day when fathers do as much childcare as mothers, most children will choose the one who has nurtured them most.   As ever with women's rights, men get their backlash in first. They were slamming doors in women's faces to give them a taste of "women's lib" before women ever gained a shred more equality. Here we go again: you want men to do more childcare? Then give fathers rights before they've earned them."   Baginni lists the modern man's (legitimate) complaints, but, as he points out,   "There is something in all these complaints, but the fairest response a woman could give to them is: welcome to the real world. Yes, the modern male faces new and confusing pressures. But anyone who thinks western men are not still the most privileged group in human history doesn't know Kylie's arse from her elbow grease. On the whole, becoming a successful woman remains tougher than it does for a man, and the price of achievement is to earn the label of "hard bitch".  Clever women have been claiming stupid white men rule the world for years, but the first person to be widely lauded for saying so is Michael Moore, another stupid white man. A woman can make a point incessantly, but not until a man says it is it taken seriously".   Toynbee writes that  "The pay gap still yawns too wide for most women to be breadwinners for their families. Domestic violence and the failure of rape cases is only now getting political attention, due to Harriet Harman. Motherhood is only now starting to get the help it needs from the state, thanks to Margaret Hodge. Women make up the great majority of the poor, from motherhood through to old age. So in next week's expected reshuffle, the cabinet had better be filled with women determined to put this right."

      Went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 at last today, and thought it was absolutely magnificent; many many times better than Bowling For Columbine and really moving in places, although also really infuriating. I keep reading, mind, that people object to Moore's brand of 'propaganda' but I don't mean that is what infuriates; rather the cheerful, bloody and smug ignorance of the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Rice collective. If at times the fratboy Bush is almost likeable on the Golf course he is never anything but a disgrace elsewhere; his blase attitude just stunning. At one point, pressed on where Bin Laden is he remarks,   "And he's just, he's, he's a, he's a person who's now been marginalized, so, I, I don't know where he is, nor... and I just don't spend that much time on it, Ellie, to be honest with ya"   Um. Right.  Elsewhere, Moore notes,   "While Bush was busy taking care of his base and professing his love for our troops, he proposed cutting combat soldiers pay by 33% and assistance to their families by 60%. He opposed giving veterans a billion dollars more in health care benefits, and he supported closing veteran hospitals. He tried to double the prescription drug costs for veterans and opposed full benefits for part-time reservists. And when Staff Seargeant Brett Petriken from Flint was killed in Iraq on May 26th, the army sent his last paycheck to his family, but they docked him for the last five days of the month he didn't work, because he was dead."   Where this film succeeds is where Bowling for Columbine failed. This time round, Moore has put together a riverting and cogent narrative. Having started with the phoney election, Bush's Saudi links and the 'war' in Afghanistan (he notes that only 11,000 ground troops were sent in, and it was  two months  before they reached Bin Laden's base) it seems natural that the film will turn its attention to Iraq. Yet Moore pulls away and begins to talk about the culture of fear in America (something he didn't quite iron out in his last film), and - in the film's best sequence - about poverty in the States, about how the army represents the best option for the disenfranchised of, say, (and here Moore finally shambles into view) his beloved Flint, Michigan. The film begins to wander...  But does it? Moore's structure is genius; when he moves, finally, on to Iraq he has done something documentary makers the world over would kill to do - he provides a marvellous contextual backdrop to the film's thesis:  the young men and women of America who enlist into our armies (he says) are willing to fight and die for their country. They fight so we don't have to. They die so we don't have to. The only thing they ask of us is that we only send them into harm's way when it absolutely necessary.   The people he finds, listens to and interviews are ordinary Americans. Yes, he knows how to tug the heartstrings (his use of Arvo Part's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' as we see footage of 9/11 is wrenching, with that wonderful, chiming bell resonating through the cinema) but the film is not carried by the weight of his argument, or the bias of it. It is carried by the stories he tells. His surprisingly masterful direction is the icing on the cake.   A really super film, and it made me as angry as hell.

       urlLink Arthur's Seat Webcam (below)    "The ancient and extinct volcano in the east-end of the city dominates Edinburgh's skyline.   However, its imposing figure is something of an optical illusion as it stands only 250m tall and can be walked in around an hour through some fairly gentle slopes.   The walk is well worth the effort as the entire city of Edinburgh in all its glory stretches out around from around the base to the sea in the north and the Pentland Hills, part of the same volcanic range, to the south."     .

      My visit to Edinburgh has been soundtracked by two records;  Faith  by The Cure, and  Velvet Donkey  by Ivor Cutler. The first is wildly innapropriate. Edinburgh is like no place I have ever been to, with its dark, dark hills behind the city and stunning, jagged topography (the sea suddenly appearing this afternoon behind a neglected corner - where did that come from?) but it isn't, for all the hills' efforts, a dark city.   It stays light late here (a blue sky at nine last night, yet I end up in an uncharacteristically awful pub and a quiz starts immediately. The first two quesions are about Scottish football. The third is "which part of the body is also a punctuation mark?". I drink up.) It's rarely like this, though, and I find the city  invigorating .  I get the bus back from the city centre to the campus and try to concentrate on my CD, but couples on the street kiss, just where Robert Smith wails. Perhaps that sounds as it should be. It didn't work like that. Edinburgh renders The Cure cheerful. Smith should try it. I put on Ivor Cutler; that's more like it. I wonder whether to buy a strip of fridge magnets, they're Scottish words. Was Cutler from Edinburgh? I'll look it up when I get home (I'm in Edinburgh airport writing this, killing time). I decide to save the castle for when I come back, buying Vic a guide book so we have to.  And then I have to get the bus home, listening to Ivor and wishing I lived here.   "Oho, my eyes are sharp.  There's a man behind the hill, he's running out of sight. But when he rounds the corner I shall glimpse him.  Oho, my eyes are sharp. "How do you know he's there, if you say he's out of sight?" I hear an old man say.  Oho, my eyes are sharp. He's been out of sight for 60 years, running awful slow. I'm scared to go round to look in case he comes round the other side.  Oho, my eyes are sharp."

      Blogging this from the departure lounge at Gatwick as I prepare to fly up to Edinburgh for a few days. Anyone who can not appreciate the giddy pleasure of flying has surely lost their pleasure in life; it is tremendously exciting. At the check in desk behind me earlier a woman arrived, looking nervous, with her two daughters. One said "look mum, if you want to go to Prague or Inverness you had better get in that queue, the gate is about to close". Mishearing, their mother tore across to the other queue in a moment of panic, leaving her offspring clutching their heads in shame, hissing "mum, we're  not going  to Prague or Inverness". It was a good moment.  Flying is probably the most exciting thing we'll ever do. Attending academic conferences (which is what I'm about to do) is not. But it is a wonderful excuse.

      Not had an awful lot of time to blog, recently; having spent much of last week in Leeds I spent the weekend helping lovely Vic celebrate her birthday and yesterday out of the office meeting an academic from Sussex University. Today I've got a huge amount of work to do in preparation for another work trip tomorrow; up to Edinburgh for three days - a trip I'm really looking forward to, having never been to Scotland.   Logging on, there's lots happening; the Brighton Bloggers resource, which has lain dormant ever since I first discovered it, seems to be kicking back into life, with a  urlLink summer meet up  mooted and some new bloggers registering.  urlLink For a list of brighton blogs click here .

Drinking With You 6. Vine to Vine 7. Easy to Leave 8. Engines and Anvils  The mysteriously titled 'New Song' is, surprise surprise, no new it doesn't have a title yet, but it a couple of minutes of blistering punk-pop, and highly regarded by the band / woefully under-rehearsed (note to self; delete as applicable).

       urlLink {REDLINERANTS}   is a (affects expression of immense distaste) 'Blog for Bush', so has to work hard to get a link here. It manages it because it contains a complete transcript of  urlLink Michael Moore's  'Farenheit 911'. I'm not sure I want to read it, preferring to wait for the real thing, but I'm definitely glad I  can  read it. The link above points to part one of the transcript.  urlLink This is part 2 . I believe there's one more to follow - I'll update when it gets posted.    An extract: The narrator, naturally, is Moore.   SECRETARY POWELL: The United States is prepared to lead a Coalition of the Willing that will do it.  PRESIDENT BUSH: When I say we will lead a Coalition of the Willing to disarm him if he chooses not to disarm, I mean it.  REPORTER: Who is in that Coalition of the Willing?  PRESIDENT BUSH: You will find out who is in the Coalition of the Willing.  (words "Coalition of the Willing" appear over a globe)  VOICEOVER: The Coalition of the Willing roll call: the Republic of Palau. The Republic of Costa Rica. The Republic of Iceland.  NARRATOR: Of course none of these countries has an army or, for that matter, weapons. (showing video clips of people pounding rocks, riding horses and such) So it looked like we'd be doing most of the invading stuff ourselves. But then there was also...  VOICEOVER: Romania. The Kingdom of Morocco.   NARRATOR: Morocco wasn't officially a member of the Coalition, but according to one report, they did offer to send 2,000 monkeys to help detonate landmines.   PRESIDENT BUSH: These are men of vision.  VOICEOVER: The Netherlands.   PRESIDENT BUSH: And I'm incredibly proud to call 'em allies.  (video of baboons sitting at a conference table)  VOICEOVER: Afghanistan.   NARRATOR: Afghanistan? Hm. Oh yeah, they had an army. Our army! I guess that's one way to build a coalition: just keep invading countries. Yes, with our mighty coalition intact (more video of primitive folk wrestling, riding bikes, being very non-Western European... except for the bikes), we were ready.   SECRETARY RUMSFELD: One could almost say it's the mother of all coalitions.

      Is this not a magnificently frightening image; wonderful!   "Just as the last flying ants collapse, exhausted, after their spectacular aerial mating swarms, Britain's modest heatwave has brought a new insect plague to parts of the south and east coasts.  Millions of marmalade hoverflies have crossed from the continent on warm thermals, causing havoc on beaches and seafronts where children and families have mistaken their banded black-and-yellow colouring for wasps.  'It was just horrific,' said esplanade shopkeeper Jeanette King, a former mayor of Walton on the Naze in Essex where the 'marmalades' - harmless and the commonest of Britain's 270 species of hoverfly - came ashore at the weekend.    'Children were screaming, people were covering up prams and pushchairs. If you stopped still for a moment, you could get covered in them. I was told that it was the same all the way to Kirby le Soken, and that's quite a step [away].' Drifts of the hoverflies also piled up along the foreshore between Walton and Clacton, as insects which had failed to make the Channel crossing were washed up by the tide."    urlLink 'When is a wasp not a wasp?'

      Granted, it’s easy to quote verbatim from more talented and successful writers at the Guardian, and granted, it presents a rather narrow set of cultural references for my continually doing so, but in doing so I’m trying to forge links between the things I read and the things I think. The Guardian today inspires the usual mixture of emotions – from horror at the continuing debacle of Guantanemo to amusement at Simon Hattenstone and Fay Weldon’s articles in G2. And it’s easy to think that these things have nothing in common. But I love reading newspapers because threads begin to emerge.  So I read all this on the train and was left at the end thinking about the comfort and humour of British life and British culture. How everything I read somehow confirmed something about what I already knew about this country (stop me if I start talking about Albion).  Kit-Kats (and there’s nought more British than that) have,  urlLink Fay Weldon writes , recently changed their slogan from the evergreen ‘Have a break, have a Kit-Kat’ to the considerably less charming ‘Make the most of your Break’. As an ex advertising copwriter she’s critical. She writes….   “Also, … the imperative form of the verb is old-fashioned. "Haven't you realised," I'd call out after them down the corridor, "that the present participle is the in, reassuring thing? How about 'Taking a Breather, Sharing a KitKat' (I offer that to Nestlé Rowntree for free, for old times' sake)? With a picture of a couple down a cave or up a mountain, or coming up from a shag (if you must), or a smiling doctor and a nurse in casualty” …    “You're in the business of spin, these days, lads and ladettes in the creative core of the ad world, not just thinking up ways of selling space for the client. You need to sharpen up your ideas. Doesn't the Home Office - from which unsafe, unjust and intolerant legislation flows non-stop - describe itself as "building a safe, just and tolerant society"? Does not my local county council, while the prisons fill up with humiliated old folk unable to pay the council tax, describe itself as "caring, enjoying, living?" Just take a feel-good word and add "ing" and you're away, these days: the Orwellian semantics of the new world order flow seamlessly through our brains.”    Far more comforting is the world which Peter Duncan (stay with me) inhabits; the ex-Blue Peter presenter has been  urlLink recruited as Britain’s Chief Scout  and, as such, is forever in use of the present participle; constantly climbing, doing, playing, working. He is outrageously youthful and enthusiastic. He is photographed up a tree and has, the picture shows, very small and delicate feet. The article ends   Duncan is in the garden climbing trees for the photographer. I ask him if he thinks of himself as a man or a boy. "Ermmm ... transition. I may become a man this year ... Maybe when I get inaugurated in September, maybe that will be my inauguration into manhood." "Oh God, he's not in the tree is he?" Annie shouts from the kitchen. "Just be careful will you, Pete. Don't do anything silly."   From such fripperies to Guantanemo is an unlikely leap; but even in the Guardian’s exhaustive and upsetting coverage of the experiences of the  urlLink Tipton Three  there is a sudden moment of the absurd; we’re conditioned to think of Muslims as increasingly ‘other’ – when the three returned to England and exchanged their stories for payment they were roundly criticised and their stories pronounced as discredited, although no-one ever accuses the mother of Sarah Payne of compromising the truth simply because she is being financially rewarded for telling her awful story in print. The three, the intimation clearly runs, aren’t quite ‘one of us’ enough for us to care for their account. And it almost feels true. But the story runs that   “After months of questioning in coercive conditions, Mr Rasul admitted meeting Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta, one of the September 11 hijackers, in Afghanistan in 2000. In fact, he was working in a Currys store in the West Midlands.”   And all of a sudden he is the man in Currys who helped me choose my stereo. And the disparity between what we are told and what is true is more apparent than ever. The moral absolutes of a thousand political cliches bend and tear in the wind  ( and we  don't want that!)  Meanwhile, with the three  back home , we are back in the Britain we know, of Currys, of Kit-Kats and Kingsley Amis - and we can forget about politics, but only for a moment.  We’ve moved on a bit from Wodehouse, too, while we’re talking national stereotypes, but I think he would have approved of  urlLink Lucy Mangan’s  article on the British love of a good battleaxe. A british man may no longer be a brit if he is a muslim, but an aunt is still an aunt. And aunts, lest we forget, are never gentlemen.   “Why this proliferation on screen of battleaxe women? Perhaps because there's something undeniably exhilarating about watching people who deal only in absolutes, and are untouched by the doubts and questions that plague the rest of us. They steam implacably ahead while the rest of us flail about in a sea of moral relativism and get nothing but mental cramp for our trouble.  I grew up surrounded by them. Multitudinous aunts of northern extraction, zaftig dimensions (it wasn't until I hit puberty that I realised that brassieres didn't have to be made by Govan steelworkers) and indomitable will have swept, stately as galleons, through my life. They quelled infantile riots, dispensed orders, enforced discipline and clouted you into the middle of next week if you disagreed with them.”

      You can walk into practically any branch of Oxfam or almost any other charity shop in Britain and buy a copy of Kingsley Amis's 'The Old Devils'. And indeed also 'Lucky Jim', 'Stanley and the Women' or 'Russian Hide and Seek'. Indeed, with the exception of 'Stanley...', you should probably do so. But Kingsley Amis wrote over twenty novels and the vast majority of them have been out of print for many years. The TV adaptation of 'A Girl Like You' introduced one more book to the general public a year or two ago, but if you want anything more than that or 'Lucky Jim' you'll have to go second hand. And even then large amounts of his back catalogue are very hard to find.  Unfairly stereotyped as either an 'angry young man' or a sexist old pig, Amis is rightly lauded for being the funniest British writer since Wodehouse. But he was also a magnificent writer with an ear for language (and sound) to die for and a wonderful imagination, and a fine poet to boot. Happily, I ducked into Waterstones on my lunch break (best air conditioning in Chichester; it's  sweltering  here) and discovered, first, that 'Jake's Thing' has been republished in a rather racy looking 'Vintage Blue' series (along with 'The Rachel Papers', 'Portnoy's Complaint', 'The Cement Garden' etc).     Better still, a glance at the shelves reveals that Vintage have gone further, and are finally reissuing his back catalogue. But if the packaging of 'Jake's Thing' suggests that nothing has changed in the public perception of Amis senior, the reissue programme tells a different story.       Beautifully packaged and tellingly branded on the spine not as 'Kingsley Amis' but 'AMIS', the designs seem to reinforce and encourage the notion that we should be re-thinking Amis's contribution to post-war fiction. One can almost imagine saying "Oh, you thought I meant  Martin Amis ? No. I meant  Amis ". Of the newly published books, I can say little; I've found it as hard to track them down as the above indicates. Should have no such problems now, though. Thank you,  urlLink Vintage .

      A big percentage of people who come to my site appear to be on the lookout for any story as long as there is some piranha angle, judging by my stats. Well, I sympathise. I like a good piranha story as much as the next man, and can only assume the surge in interest in recent days is down to the story of a boy  urlLink who had his finger half-bitten off  by one of the vicious little bastards in a public fountain in Hong Kong. However, assuming you've seen that story, I just dredged up another couple of links.  In the Guardian, a urlLink  tale of fishy frolics  down the Amazon with David Atkinson.      Hook, line and skewer ... David Atkinson hopes the piranha won't make a meal of him first. Photo: Patricia Portocarrero (The Guardian)    And elsewhere, courtesy of a random google search... the comic character we've all been waiting for.   urlLink PIRANHA!   See how this description grabs you:  "The whole image of Piranha was the first thing to come...this crazy, mysterious, snarling and very dangerous looking woman with her huge metal coat and  a giant fish for a hat "

      Further to my Daily Mail post, I was reading a copy of The Times downstairs in the canteen just now and I noticed an odd-construction in one of their comment pieces; in the midst of an article defending the Pope from all those nasty feminists he so justly attacked last week (not literally - that's an interesting image), the characterisation runs something along the lines of "Islington based, Guardian reading, SUV-driving, career women and liberals".  SUV-driving?  Any readers of the Times out there? Do they normally add this to the normal anti-Guardian stereotype? Hmm.  Meanwhile, much Guardian reader-baiting over at Peter Cuthbertson's  urlLink Conservative Commentary  blog; where the term 'liberal' is used as a US style term of abuse.  When Andrew tried to claim it back he was met with the following reply from one of the young tories who inhabit the comments boxes, looking for people to oppress:  "If you are a small government, pluralistic, pro free market  liberal  (like me) you already have to qualify your liberalism by pointing that out, otherwise people assume you're just some morally limp, self righteous bedwetter who wants to let all the criminals out and give all our money to the chronically workshy. It's just easier to call yourself a conservative."   So now  they're  claiming the term 'liberal'! Where will it end...

       urlLink Pete Ashton's linklog  points me to the following site:  urlLink Mailwatch: Watching them, watching us , which is a fabulous idea which maybe needs a bit of development; at the moment it's mostly poking fun at the front page and the odd-spoof, whereas the possibilities of making serious satirical points aided by this obscene and vulgar paper are near limitless.   When I commuted in London I would often pick up Daily Mails on the tube and I almost miss the attacks of gibbering fury and burst-out-loud hilarity that reading it would induce. Hopefully the bloggers behind Mailwatch can mine this rich vein of material. And if you spot any appropriate stories for them,  urlLink drop them an email .  And, not meaning to brag, the banner line on the Mail on the 29th June ('Can You See an Elephant on the Underground?') refers to a website which I spotted and  urlLink mentioned  in February. Here's the link it referred to again...    urlLink http://www.animalsontheunderground.com/

      Am quoting verbatim from today's link, because 'RobotPerson', another brighton-based blogger, has not got post links on his blog so I can't link directly to this entry; still, it appears on 29 June if you do want to click through and scroll down to it. I'd recommend you take a look anyway.   : "Today on the train I had my first encounter with the strange phenomenon known as sleep paralysis. One moment I was comfortably dozing, the next I was awake but completely unable to move. From my closed eyelids to my leaden limbs I was conscious, but utterly frozen. It was very, very strange...  Sleep paralysis happens when a normal brain function goes slightly awry: During normal REM sleep the part of the brain that controls movement becomes paralysed - a necessity, as otherwise we'd physically act out our dreams. I remember once seeing a clip of a sleeping cat who had this paralysis effect somehow bypassed. The dreaming cat was jumping around and swatting the air, acting out his dreams of catching birds (cats dreams must be good fun).   The sleep paralysis effect occurs when the switch that releases the paralytic hold on the body for some reason doesn't flip. An alert mind in a totally locked body is the result, and if you're thinking that this sounds pretty scary, you're spot on.  This morning I'd been drifting in and out of sleep all the way in - I'm feeling drained right now after the exertions of the stag. I remember coming-to somewhere around City Thameslink thinking that I had a few more minutes to doze. Next thing I know, I can feel and hear the train pulling into a station but can't move at all. Particularly worrying was not being to open my eyes, although it felt much more like I just couldn't see than I had my eyes closed".   In fact, I'll stop there.  urlLink Click through to read the rest of the post . June 29th, remember.

       urlLink The Libertines - The Libertines LP   ME: It's just not very good, despite the hype. In fact, it's a shambolic, under-produced set of half-songs and demos which sounds unfocused and half-assed. And it's only got a couple of decent tunes.  me: That's true. You can see why Mick Jones, who produced the record, loves it though; it's a homage to the Clash, complete with faux-Strummer, half-illegible vocals and brittle Jones-ian guitars. It recalls that swaggering, almost effortless late-Clash period where 'Sandanista', 'London Calling' and 'Combat Rock' just oozed with new songs; half half-baked, half genius. Only without the genius.  ME: And that's not all. Anyone familiar with early, ramshackle Blur will hear plenty of echoes, too.  me: Yep. And 'Narcissist' is clearly an attempt to sound like The Kinks...  ME: 'Campaign of Hate', meanwhile, is just 'I am the Fly' all over again.  me: And 'Tomblands' is pure Clash. But it's pretty good, actually.  ME: You think? Blur's 'Think Tank' was a magnificent, inspired Clash-influenced album. This is just a photocopy.  me: Perhaps. But for all it's flaws I think it's a strangely likeable record - the stumbling, obscure singing, the loose guitar playing, the drums which sounds like they were recorded in a cardboard box, it all reminds me almost of...  ME: Don't compare it to 'Slanted and Enchanted'!!! Don't you  dare.   me: OK. It's not a patch on 'Slanted and Enchanted', that's true.  ME: It's not a patch on 'Terror Twilight' either.  me: When are you going to admit that Pavement weren't as consistently brilliant as you'd like to believe???  ME: (says nothing).  me: Either way, some of the songs on 'The Libertines'  are  pretty good. 'Can't Stand Me Now', 'Music When the Lights Go Out', 'Tomblands'...  ME: 'What Became of the Likely Lads'?  me: Yes! Ok, so it's derivative, under-played and only has emotional currency because of the poignancy of the lyrics (Carl sings "If you pipe all summer long / Then get forgiven in a song / Well that's a touch, my lad") - but it's kind of fun! It has an energy and drive you won't hear in, say, 'Franz Ferdinand'.  ME: I'm not that bothered about that record, either.  me: You only say that because you're not sure whether it's cool to like Franz Ferdinand or run them down.  ME: OK. So it's got a couple of good songs on it. What about the grimmer moments? What about those awful melodies on 'What Katie Did'? The 'la la la' chorus on 'The Man Who would be King'? How about the Doors-like dirge of 'Road to Ruin'?  me: That one's awful.  ME: It is. And the pisspoor far outweighs the good on this record. As for energy and drive, they sound like they can't be bothered on half of this LP! Getting Mick Jones in again just means it's a tired re-run of the band's previous sound (and the sound of their heroes), a re-hash. I want to hear the lyrics! I don't want a song to fall apart half way through. Nor do I want a load of rusty, lackadaisical playing. Except on 'Slanted and Enchanted'.  me: But here's the question - will you listen to this album again?  ME: That's not the question. The question is, why are the NME proclaiming this lot the greatest band of their generation!?  me: Will you, or won't you?  ME: I will. Soon, perhaps. It's quite an intriguing record.  me: Told you.  ME: Hmm. But it's  rubbish.   me: Right.

      On Thursday night I went to meet a selection of Brighton (and Hove's)  urlLink finest bloggers . The notion of a blogging community is a slightly odd one, not least when you have not yet  established  yourself within the community. I have been, then, a member of the Brighton Bloggers web ring for several months, but in that time my interaction with them has been slim; I've linked to a few, and had the odd link back, and read a few, and - perhaps - been read by a few in return. But a community obviously works along some sense of 'togetherness', the suggestion of some sympathy, some mutual purpose or - more simply - friendship. Not knowing anyone, my being part of a 'community' is little more than a nice idea.   But the people I met were really nice, and talented too. I know that it's perfectly possible to create a community online (indeed Live Journal does all that stuff perfectly well) and thus make the meeting up side of things redundant, but I think there's a definite correlation between meeting people and reading about them; unless you are willing to dredge the recesses of every part of your personal life, one's blog will always be the equivalent of somebody's holiday snaps; momentarily revealing yet in need of some kind of narrative to make it  mean something . Oh, I don't know, why, why should it  have to mean something , I guess. But still...  Reading people's blogs, though, makes more sense after you have shared a beer - for me, if no-one else. I find that I stop scanning for information, for a start, and begin to just enjoy the prose for a while. Perhaps I am far too curious to be a good blog-reader, forever looking for proof, for identity, an inveterate google-searcher, utterly frustrated when no clues can be found. Maybe all it is is that meeting someone and saying hallo means I can skip the 'archive' buttons when I arrive at the site; feel more qualified just to sit and read, which is the fun of blogs.   Whatever, it's always slightly intimidating, slightly exciting and slightly peculiar introducing yourself to a new set of people (although it was nice that  urlLink Andrew  was there, who of course I know), but reassuring to find it pleasant, although I suppose I'm pretty good at getting on with new people. Sharing geographical location as a reference point rather than, say, an interest in american indie rock from 1989 to 94 or the novels of Martin Amis, the blogs of Brighton are a mixed bag, but meeting is testament to the fact that you can write about XML, XTC or ecstacy and it doesn't mean you won't get along.   Instead I find myself looking forward to the next opportunity to meet.   A short introduction to the Brighton bloggers;  urlLink (and pictures here)    urlLink Yummy Wakame   urlLink Andy Budd   urlLink Scarlet   urlLink Jane and Richard's Yak and Natter   urlLink Adactio   urlLink iJosh   urlLink Bedsit Bomber Blog   urlLink Pete Barr-Watson   and here's a photo of me, too, with a pint. And Andrew.
