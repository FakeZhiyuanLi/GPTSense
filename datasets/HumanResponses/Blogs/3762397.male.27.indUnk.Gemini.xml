      For some reason I knew that MB's birthday was July 2.  Looooong day at work.  And in unrelated news, the BET Awards Show was today.  Kodak Theater, Hollywood, CA.  I didn't watch it, nor did I intend to watch it.  It would be too sad.  I can't believe it.  Right in my own backyard, and I can't do anything about it.  It's a slap in the face.  It's kicking a guy when he's down.  What's the use complaining?  Muses don't read blogs, anyway.  But if she does, just know that the North Star always points north.

      It's hard to be Rex without my car.  Not that it's a spectacular car or anything; it's just hard to be Rex without my car.  It's even harder to be Rex without all the junk that was packed into it and traveled across the country in 4 days.  First day of work, 2 patients, and I'm already bored with my career.   I rediscovered Cerritos All-Stars Radio.  If you're into good hiphop, check them out every Monday night at www.cerritosallstars.com   I'll get some pictures up here soon.

      It's hard to believe that the last time I really lived in Cerritos was 9 years ago.  When I moved to San Diego in 1995, I didn't realize that it really could have been the last time I lived in Cerritos.    In any case... freeways!  The Southland is tangled with freeways.  Artesia, San Gabriel River, San Bernardino, Santa Ana, Pomona, Santa Monica, etc...  A few days ago, Chauncy Chocha said that Los Angeles has everything you need. Today, I did a little bit of driving.  Freeways make it easy to get to where you need to go.  The Southland has a myriad of freeways, thus making many things accessible and attainable.  But, freeways are only useful if you know where you're going...  "and you're racing again like there's no limitation 'round the California bend." -Emm G.

      Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood Blvd., Highland Ave., Sunset Blvd....  I love LA. I mean, New York is cool and all, but nothing beats LA. LA has everything you want, and everything is accessable. And diversity!  Asian clubs. Wack. I'd rather live high on Highlands.  "Fool me once, shame on....... shame on you. ....... It fooled me.

       A few years ago I met a girl.&nbsp; She was divorced with 2 children.&nbsp; She said that it was an awful divorce (rumor has it that she caught the husband doing the deed..... and she was pregnant with their 2nd child at the time).&nbsp; I worked with this girl for 2 years, and, since we were friends, I formed a negative opinion about her ex-husband.     &nbsp;   Well, as chance would have it, I eventually ended up working with her ex-husband.&nbsp; And, being the open-minded person that I am, I learned that he actually is a pretty decent person.&nbsp; Yes, he is guilty of a bad act, and he admits his mistake, but overall he's a nice guy.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I don't work with him anymore, as I have moved on to bigger and better things (and another state).&nbsp; But there was one thing he always wanted me to know.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would oftentimes get into conversations where he would talk about his life, legal problems, wife, ex, etc... And each conversation would end the same way.&nbsp; He always said,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the utmost sincerity, &nbsp;that  honesty  is always the best policy.&nbsp;   Always  .     &nbsp;   And everytime he said that, I always thought to myself that he's come a long way...     &nbsp;   Honesty is the Truth.&nbsp; And the Truth can't be all that bad, right?    &nbsp;  Unless you're a fuckin loser, redneck-wannabe, Chinese-Vietnamese-whateverthehellyouwannabees, how-the-hell-you-became-an-optometrist, Louisiana hoe who sucks uncircumcised dick.....dumbass!

       I've always pondered this situation:     &nbsp;   I wake up from a good night's sleep only to find someone standing next to my bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;S/he is holding a gun to my head and asks me if I'm ready to die.&nbsp; What would I say?     &nbsp;   I always thought I would say yes, but today I realized I would say no.&nbsp; I don't take chances.&nbsp; I always seem to let things slip through the cracks.&nbsp; Opportunity only knocks once.&nbsp; Seize the day, yada yada yada...

      A funny thing happened on my way to work today.  I always thought "Everything" (MB) was about God.  I still think it is, but it could be about someone whom you care for, or who cares for you.  Like an angel.   Angel - 1.  An appellation given to a person supposed to be of angelic goodness or loveliness; 2.  Attendant  spirit.  Around here, angels land in LGB.  And when they do, I sure hope I'm lucky enough to see them.  Are you Polish American?  Are you an optometrist?  Then you need to check out www.paoa.org.  Good times!

      What a weekend!  A trip to San Diego every now and then is good for your health.  Driving through OC is becoming a bitch, though.  They need to build more freeways.  Although they do have toll roads, but those are not  free ways.  If you ever come across an Islands Restaurant, I suggest you check it out.  It takes the Earth about 23.25 hours to rotate about its axis, half of those hours are spent in the sunlight and the other half at night.  Those few fleeting moments at sunrise and sunset make for beautiful picture opportunites.  Cliffs overlooking the ocean also make beautiful pictures.  But it's the   person   in the picture that ultimately makes the picture   beautiful  .

      Well, I guess that's that.  Bad things tend to happen on Friday the 13th.  Things happen for reasons... I wish I saw it coming.  Coincidences occur, we just have to open our eyes and realize them.  I've always pondered this moment, but I never knew it would affect me this much.  2 weeks ago.  That's the story of my life.  For someone known for his punctuality, I'm always late when it comes to me.  Another regret I have to live with.  But this time it's forever.  The truth is that I'm just not important anymore.    A part of me left today.  That's just the way it is.

      Up the 405 to, like, the valley!  PDAs have sex?  At least somebody is.  Palm and Pocket PC hooking up is like beastiality.  Thanks to Dr. K for hooking up the PalmaSutra (among other things).  Thought of the day:  Stars are billions of light years away.  A light from a distant star takes many, many years to reach Earth.  Some stars that we see may not even exist anymore.  Therefore, looking into the sky is like looking into the past.  The closer something is to you, the more relevant it is to you.  So, surround yourself with people and things that you want to be relevant to you, because that's where your future is.  I forgot to say this last week... hello, Leo.
