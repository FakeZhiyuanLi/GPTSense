      On the underground in London, at rush hour, the trains are packed with people and only the lucky ones get a seat. Everyone else has to stand; packed in so tight you almost can't look down at the floor. The train is humming and the tracks are noisy - everything clatters and sways. We are almost the beginning of the Central Line, the busiest one, where there are long distances in between stops.  I'm standing right in front of one of the sliding doors, next to the compartment wall, looking at your face reflected in the glass of the door. You're standing behind me and I can feel your breath on my neck; you lower your head a little and rake your chin across the back of my neck, the stubble scraping tender skin. You know that makes me hot – always – and my spine sings knowing your body is inches away. Everyone around us is reading newspapers, trying to chat above the clatter of the train or just dozing.  Your right hand slips around in front of me, under my shirt and skims over my breast. You leave it there, unmoving, feeling my nipple harden under your fingers. I raise my right arm, placing my hand flat against the side of the door and smile.  You lean over my shoulder and whisper in my ear. " I'm going to fuck you, here ". And you pinch my nipple hard, so I gasp a little. I look to my left; a huge wall of a man in a massive overcoat has his shoulder against the doors, blocking my view of the carriage entirely. I can smell the wet wool of his coat.  I look in the glass, over my shoulder at your reflected face. “ No ” I mouth at you, barely whispering. “ Really…. No! ”  “ Oh, yes… ” you hiss in my ear. I’m scared because no matter how crowded and noisy, people simply aren’t deaf, dumb and blind. I’m scared because I know you well enough to know that you won’t listen; that you’re going to get your way, because you always do. And I’m scared because I can hardly let you touch me without moaning. But you are pressed up against my back, and I can feel that you’re hard and I know that this will please you.  " Unzip me, " you whisper. I reach my left hand around, between us, and unzip you and I can feel that you are hard, very hard and it's making me breathless - my heart is hammering against my chest. I slowly pull your cock free and I can feel it hot and throbbing in my hand and I want to turn around and put my mouth on yours and suck your lips and kiss you hard. But I don’t  You push my hand away and slide yours down between us and hitch up my skirt. I look down at the glass in front of me. You’ve pulled it up so high that even at the front, I can see the tops of my stockings reflected in the glass. What the hell must it look like at the sides. I say a tiny fervent prayer that the huge man beside up doesn’t decide to move, so that it's rucked up between our bodies and I can feel your hot cock against my bare ass and I arch my back a little to feel it better, and you whisper, next to me, " You  DO  want it, don't you... " And you KNOW I do, " Yes, Sir. Yes I do, " I whisper... you can't hear me. But you can see my lips move and you KNOW what I am saying.  And I stand a little on my tippy toes, with my legs spread wider so I can feel your cock slide between my legs. And you can feel that I am so wet, my panties are soaked and my thighs are sticky.  " Pull your panties aside, " you whisper, ” so I can fuck you. " But I hesitate, because as horny as I am, I’m still scared. I’m scared I won't be able to keep quiet. You lean your head over and say " DO IT... NOW " firmly in my ear.   I do... I reach down and between my legs and pull the crotch aside, and my fingers brush over the head of your cock as I do. I can feel you slowly guiding it just to the opening of my pussy, and slowly pushing the head of it in.  And I gasp, because I’m so tight, because I’m not relaxed at all, and I’m scared. And you reach your hands around to the front of me, onto my hips and whisper: " Not one sound... " and you push your cock into me; pulling me onto it by the hips.   You’re breathing in my ear - breathing harder but you are still so, so controlled. And my legs are quivering as you slowly, pump in and out of my pussy. I want to move – god, I want to move so badly - I want to ride it but I can’t trust myself to be as controlled as you. It’s a subtle yet effective form of bondage; immobilized by what people will think. By millimeters, I’m pushing my ass back against you to get more of what I need from you.  You are throbbing as you fuck me – I can feel it acutely because you’re moving so slowly - and every jolt the train makes feels like a thrust. I lean my face against the cold glass of the sliding doors, and grind myself on you. Every inch of my skin is flushed  now and my own breath is coming in short, sharp bursts. Pushing myself away from the glass, I watch my own face and yours. You’re looking too and you know this smile; this is how I smile when the only thing I want in the world is for you not to stop fucking me like this. Holding in my moans is almost killing me.  Because I’m going to come; I’m seconds away and every stroke is pushing me closer.  Oh god, I can feel the heat that always begins, it seems, in the bones of my hips first and then my muscles lock tight onto your cock; I watch your face in the glass as it happens. It erodes your own control just slightly – for a moment, your eyes slip closed – you raise your chin and inhale deeply. Then you’re back; eyes open again, you grin at me in the glass. I hear you whisper it again " Not  ONE  sound ," and I manage to nod as my body twitches, coming hard on you.  You’re cock feels twice as huge inside me now. Your slow thrusts become so regular, so deep and I know it’s your time. Your hands on my hips pull me onto your cock hard and you stop. You spurt and then pulse cum into me, the flood is hot as it fills me and, as you move your hips in tiny shudders, it trickles thickly down my inner thigh. Burying your head in the crook of my neck, you kiss the skin there, silently, once and whisper, " good girl " in my ear.  You pull out of me, and zip up your pants and I reach around and smooth my skirt down.   And the train pulls into the station.

      I just recently explored the world of MUDs and MUCKs and such. I always knew vaguely what they were but I had never indulged. Primarily because I didn't really have the patience to set up characters or the time (remember lag? They have it in spades).  So my friend, who does indulge  urlLink Maculate Deviant  ( very good blog - go read it - she's taking a blog break right now - but the archives are wonderful)  kind of made me decide to give it a go.  Well - it IS very complicated and there is a certain amount of time invested in creating your character and setting yourself up properly. For those of you used to IM chat convenience it is very frustrating. However, all the bitching aside, it is an incredibly immersive environment - especially is you love words. The problem is you can hang out in a text-based cafe all day talking to people who are often something other than human, and your life slips by while you're typing.   The bonus is that you meet some people who are some of the best "on the fly" writers in the world - and living in that environment has got to train you to it. So you are honing your descriptive and dialogue skills constantly and evaluating other peoples'.  It really isn't for everyone and it is really worth to talk to someone who has used them. I was lucky enough to have a guide.  Now... I'm just trying to decide what kind of furry animal I REALLY want to be. It so remind's me of the John Osborne play "Look Back in Anger"... because   Little squirrel, you have such a shiny bushy tail.....

      Ok... I admit it - I like it.   I really  DON'T  know why. Admittedly, I'm not actually crazy about the monster tentacle stuff - but I really like the bondage part of it. I also love the way the girls always look on the verge of bursting into tears - almost all the time - but especially when they are in compromised situations. And the drool! The drool is  GREAT .   And why is it that some of the raunchiest hentai has pubic hair? Having some myself - I feel downright edgy!  And the bondage - well it's over the top funny

      Why is it that, after having a perfectly mutually satisfying RP on chat, people feel they have to then go and tell you their life story. Or offer to let you see pictures of them or their  dogs .  The thing I love most about fooling about online is that it is so totally anonymous... I LIKE the fact that, in their mind, I am whatever particular brand of goddess or bedraggled guttersnipe they require. And in my mind, they are exactly the thing I crave. I adore the fact that we aren't ever going to meet and start playing happy families. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE.   And so when, a third of the way in to a particularly delicious scenario, someone types (can I have a picture of  you?) - well, if I could have an erection, it would wither. It's not that I'm offensive looking - I'm very normal - pleasant even. But why, oh why, do you want to risk me sending you something that reminds you of that girl in high school who was totally nasty to you behind the bleachers, or worse, a very much younger version of your mother (if you don't like that sort of thing, of course).  I understand that men are visual creatures. My advice is that you go find yourself the yummiest pic on the web of someone exactly the way you want them. Then send it to me, and I'll send it back to you and *blush* when you tell me how hot I am.  All that diligent typing, that creative weaving of an utterly engulfing erotic fantasy, all that work - blown away in the fraction of a second it takes to open whatever image programme you have and take a look.  Really, talk about shooting yourself in the virtual foot!

      Never actually had one... but I can tell they are exciting and filled with vitriol. I've tried very hard, from time to time, to post something really sarcastic on someone's blog comments. But just before I hit the "post" button, I always end up relenting and posting something more non-commital instead.   Could it be that I have a fear of "blog conflict"?  Posting stories one can simply masturbate to seems so much... friendlier.

      I found myself accumulating things that simply would not fit on either  urlLink Divestiture  or my vanilla blog. Wanting to say things that couldn't be uttered in respectable places and would jar the flow of a longer story.   Here.... I've found some closet space.  I really hope you enjoy what develops here and I do hope you will tell me so.  remittance girl

      Taken in Hand had a long and bitter controversy over this territory and I don't think I want to go over all that again.  But I would like to examine the differences between the two, to illustrate the distance between them. I know this is not going to put the debate to rest - but maybe it will go some way to explaining why I chose to write about it.  Rape fantasies are about letting go of control. rape is having it taken from you.  Rape fantasies are about letting someone you trust take you by force. rape does not entail trust at all - except in a betrayal of it.  Rape fantasies can engender arousal. Rape is not even about sex; it's about violence.  Anyone care to add some more?

      Ok - in my attempt to insert Haloscan code on this blog, I have ended up completely deleting most of them. I'm really sorry for this - it was not done on purpose - I LOVE YOUR COMMENTS!!!!!  If you would like to say something that doesn't actually fit in the pidly little comments space, please email me and I will give you an account to post here. I am very interested in some of the comments that Bliatz made - they are really worth discussing further - and I will - right after dinner!  Hugs all!

      You meet a lot of people on the internet - great people, strange people, and sometimes people who frankly push you way beyond your limits.   There is a person I correspond with via IM occassionally. He is an immensely talented writer. He recently posted a part of a larger piece called Pedofile. It is well written but very, very hard for me to read.   I  absolutely know  that this person condems child abuse, absolutely. I don't want that to even be in question. But writers who skate this close to the edge do so at their own peril because there are simply some issues I find in incredibly hard to be objective about.  I am sure that the initial non-consensual sex in Divestiture is going to have the same effect on some people. They will be outraged, they will say I promote it, romanticize it, etc. This  IS  the risk that writers take.  So why are my passages of non-consensual adult sex OK with me but his passages of a child prostitute's experience not OK?   All reading is essentially interactive. The reader always reads through the lenses of their own life-experiences. People who say they read objectively are either lying or deluding themselves.  I have been raped and I have spent 8 weeks watching a 12-year old Cambodian girl die of AIDS, courtesy of a male client who was under the misapprehension that fucking a virgin would cleanse him of the disease (a common myth held by Asian men). The second experience was a thousand times more painful for me than the first.  I don't think rape is a fate worse than death; I think it is just another act of banal violence. This doesn't mean that I underestimate it's effects on the victim, or in any way sanction it. But I do believe that sex-guilt and the concept that a woman can be "sullied" or "made unclean" often cause the victims of this crime even more damage than the initial assault.   My feelings on the subject of child sexual abuse, however, are a great more vehement. Living in Southeast Asia, the problem is in your face and chronic. So the lenses I wear to read a story about it.... go red with rage. Even when the story is written in a way that clearly illustrates the distress of the victim; when the author's sympathies are clear.  Everyone has their limits.

      Show me that you can feel this brittle hunger; here,  touch,  at the base of my spine and here,   touch,  the hollow of my throat. Does this wanton essence not seep through  the skin of your fingertips,  here,   staining the blood that sings in your veins?  Lascivious appetites of this magnitude   endure  unsatiated by a single languorous afternoon; it will take years  and tears  to extinguish my flaming desire. Tease me but once in mischievous playfulness and watch the dragon  skin  of my need emerge to engulf you within the fiendish cave of my secret urges.   Now,   are you sure you want to play?

      I was chatting with someone online about porn and why most of it isn't that effective for us. I really hate it when people say... well that's because women aren't VISUAL. Bullshit! I'm very visual.   I just have a terrible time suspending disbelief! I need context, landscape, motivation. AND PLEASE NO ROMANCE! Otherwise I just think  "oh, this is two people getting paid to have sex - what a fucking bore. It's like watching two prostitutes at work."   NOT that I have anything against prostitutes.  Au contraire!  I think they are much more valuable to society than politicians, lawyers, accountants or insurance adjusters; I'm just not all that interested in seeing a plumber do his job on video for an hour. Anyway, it also occured to me that women are really turned on by auditory stuff - so.... links for the girls:  Beautiful Agony: basically real people having real orgasms.

      I'm not quite sure why writing Divestiture gave me the right to speak authoritatively on this matter. I get a lot of questions about D/s now and it isn't as if I don't have opinions on the matter because I do.  Firstly, I would like to state clearly that Divestiture is only as autobiographical as any novel might be. It is quite obviously fiction created with and informed by some experience. So, just in case you were wondering, I have never been possessed by a demon. Yes, I have had some D/s experience but they were a very private experiences; never part of a club or an organization and so it follows that I am not an expert.  So, with that proviso in mind, this is my take on Doms/Dommes and subs in the context of Divestiture because it's where I feel most comfortable holding an opinion about it.  I wanted to write a story about domination and submission completely free from a "scene" context. I also wanted it to be about two people, neither of whom if asked, would identify themselves as dominant or submissive. To put it succinctly - I really hate labels. I know they are useful, but they are also ultimately constricting.  I also wanted to discuss, within a fictional context, the fact that submissives are not the only ones coming to the party with needs. That might be obvious to some of you, but I have met my share of Doms and Dommes who wished to be seen as martyrs to the desires and needs of their subs.  And I don't want to let subs off lightly here either. Because often-times they are not as sensitive as they should be to a Dom/Dommes limits. It is unbelievably hard to say: "I love you and I respect your needs but I cannot take you to that place you want to go."  It often surprises me, when I talk to submissives and ask them what their Dom/Domme is getting out of the relationship, that there is something of a silence. They know HOW to please their dominants (they follow instructions, they take orders, they behave as they are asked to) but they are not so sure as to the mechanism of that pleasure reflex.  What makes dominant/submissive relationships so intense - if not always long-lived - it that two people come together almost chemically coded for each other. Each person's craving is the other one's pleasure and that can make for a beautiful thing. Especially when both parties are open and honest that not only do they need - but there is intense satisfaction when these needs are met.   So when I created Matthew, I wanted to make him flawed (because no matter what the comic books say, no one really loves a perfect, always right person). I wanted to make his needs clear and the source of his pleasure apparent: he craves her submission, and aspect of their union, like her reaction to pain or her surrender to discipline, are sources of deep erotic arousal to him. Nor does he ever hide it from her.  There are people who indulge in D/s for a little holiday away from vanilla sex. There are others who see it as an intensely spiritual union between people who both seek something beyond the pale. For still others it becomes the secret religion that gives meaning to their existence.  In terms of the D/s inferred in Divestiture, my guess is that it probably won't appeal to people in the first category; the holiday makers. This is not a slight on their motives -- I simply wasn't writing it from that perspective.   rg

      Well... tonight I told someone REAL about  urlLink Divestiture  - someone outside my circle of friends on the web. I found myself being really nervous and wierd about it. It's not that my friends on the web aren't real. It's that, quite probably, they will never know me; never look into my face after having read what I've written and be forced to see me in another light.  This person is never going to see me the same way again. All the things they thought I was will be as nothing --  gone in the first few pages of reading. Will they  forgive  me? Will they  like  this me? Will it  embarrass  them to look into the face of the writer? Did they know I was like this already? Just how open-minded are they going to be about what I have possessed in my mind and made real with words?  I used to wear my whole soul on my sleeve, not just my heart. I used not to give a fuck what people thought. This is the toll of time; the real one. Crystalized into something quite solid and proportional in people's minds, you become frightened of even the sound of that object breaking, and terrified of what they will make of the fragments.  Oh well, fuck it, it's done now anyway.

      21. I am aroused by the smell of a soap called "Heno de Pravia" 22. I can hear dog whistles. 23. I make snap-judgments about people based on their hands.(requires further explanation: I find hands that don't look like they have worked unattractive and I make unfair judgments about people based on it.) 24. I have a 'black thumb'; I like plants, but if you let me near one, I'll kill it just by looking at it. 25. Food: My favorite food is chicken pasta salad 26. Alcohol: I only drink vodka and only Stolichnaya 27. I have a blood fetish - the sight of it makes me moist. 28. I get panic attacks under fluorescent lights. 29. I hate "knicknacks" of any kind. If someone gives me one, I thank them politely and, when they've gone, throw it out. 30. One of my favorite things in the whole world is clean sheets. 31. I once spent all the money I had in the world ($4,000 at the time) on a painting. 32. I believe very deeply in the dignity of labour. 33. In regard to RL friends.

I sleep with a pillow between my knees. 37. I believe that creativity can be learned and taught. 38. Talking about money causes me deep embarrassment. 39.

      I have had some private answers to the Dom questions, one of the participants gave me permission to post his answers   1. When did you know you were a dominant?   Can’t  remember exactly when, but I’ve always loved the films where the heroine is tied up, and Fay Wray is in the clutch of King Kong …”aaaaeeeyyyeee … !”  Seeing photo’s and cartoons of bondage and dominance has always aroused me – I always dreamed of being the one in the black top hat and twirly moustache. It must have been from an early age, as I can recall not knowing what those aching shaky feelings in my stomach meant… then I discovered that if you play with it, it feels good and it goes off in your hand … since then I’ve always been aroused by visual stimuli rather than emotional stimuli – one of my intense addictions in the past, along with tobacco, alcohol, sex, has been porn.    2. Describe your first experience where you felt you exhibited dominant tendencies.  Can’t remember.   3. Regarding spanking, flogging, or other forms of corporal punishment, describe in detail what it makes you feel. If you are aroused by it - then why?  They make me feel in control, of course, but also responsible. It’s as if I’m entrusted with a great gift. The gift of giving pleasure through pain and I feel, I dunno, on a higher emotional, physical and sensual plane. It also makes me feel worthwhile. I’m also very tender too – I love to serve my play partner.  I guess I feel as if I’ve found the other half of my self. Like I'm where I should be - at home.     4. Regarding physical restraints: Describe what you prefer and why?  Too inexperienced to really answer this.   5. If restraints arouse you, do you know why?  They do – again, it’s as if I’m being entrusted with something very valuable ( the other persons life in effect!) and fragile and I find that them handing over their life to my control is very erotic. Also the time spent binding - the slow controlled work - takes me to another place. Perhaps it's the feeling that there is no time, no clocks anymore ...    6. Regarding control: Do you control yourself, others or both?  At the moment, I don’t really know … I’ll think more about this.   7. What type of control do you find most effective?  Too inexperienced to really answer this at this stage.   8. What type of control do you find most arousing?  See above – I’m working on this.   9. Have you ever done anything for a submissive that you found completely unarousing for you?  No – not that I wouldn’t. I feel that I’m taken over by a flow of energy which is all enveloping … like being in a swimming pool. I would be hard pressed to think of anything “unarousing” if I was with someone who had willingly submitted themselves to me. See 5.   10. Have you ever been a submissive?   I tried once but it left me cold. I think the abuse has closed off those feelings so far, and made me stubbornly refuse to serve anyone. Strange, as I would do anything for some people, it just has to be on my terms. Perhaps I am but don't know it, yet!   As you can see, the answers are incomplete, but this is really due to the dominants willingness to be thoughtful and honest about his experiences.  He has a blog of his own at:  urlLink http://my_maelstrom.blogspot.com/

      This is really a post specifically for my lovely girlfriends here.  I really had a crisis of faith last night and that is why I was up till 6 am deleting the first-draft version of Divestiture off the blogger site. I noticed that I was jonesing for comments and, when I didn't get them for a couple of posts, it really depressed me. The BITCH started talking, you know?   It made it really hard for me to think clearly and write well. I didn't want to write another sex scene just for the comments, regardless of the fact that the plot didn't warrant it at the time. The moment I started feeling that way, I thought 'shit, I'm going to ruin something I'm really proud of just for someone's anonymous comment.... no - can't let that happen'.  There have to be calms between the storms in a novel or it just becomes an exhaustive read or a litany of sex acts. I never wanted to write a selection of pornography snippets; although the sex is very important and central to the theme of the story - I don't believe it can hold together as a novel if the plot isn't multi-dimensional.  Also, there were times when I just should have let the story sit and ferment a couple of days... so that the way forward would crystalize for me - but the pressure to post was really almost overwhelming.   I know both those issues are my problem. Not the fault of the readers at all; they owe me nothing.   But I wanted to explain it properly to you guys, because you were always the best of my readers - the ones who cared about the story and not just the "wank" scenes. That is why I asked you to come here and participate in this little fun thing. I just wanted to make sure you understood that it didn't have anything to do with you guys... it was me.  Huge hugs,  rg

      I have a sneaking suspicion that people don't actually want to know 100 things about me, and actually   I don't want to know   100 things about me. So I'm morphing the meme to 20.  1. I sing  Cante Hondo  (a type of flamenco) quite well and can hit a quarter-tone. 2. I hate spreading butter on toast that has gone cold. 3. I have a little strawberry birthmark on my left buttock. 4. I used to run a religious bookstore. 5. I used to work on a telephone sex line WHILE running the religious bookstore. 6. I have masturbated while reading certain parts of Leviticus. 7. Opium was the first drug I ever did. 8. I won't go into 5 star hotels if my toenail polish is chipped. 9. For 10 years, I hoped I was a lesbian. 10. One of my cats doesn't like me. 11. I smoke.  12. I go to the gymn and then I regret that I smoke. 13. My nipples are pierced. 14. My nose is pierced too. 15. My master's thesis is on how women represent themselves on the internet. 16. My father hates my guts and is scared of me. 17. I revel in 16. 18. I love fear - especially my own 19. I have only been in love twice in my life 20. I have tiny hands.

      I read your introductory post, and it got so many thoughts going that I've given up fitting it all in a comment. And please forgive me if my language seems somewhat rigid at times. I haven't been writing much else in English than dissertations and such... and, well, a little dirty stuff too ;-)   I didn't intend for it to sound quite so much like Morpheus/The Matrix, but there we go ...  The old childhood "programs" (can't think of a better metaphor right now) running deep in the neurons of our brains often fool us when it comes to our ability to predict the consequenses of our behaviour. We stop ourselves due to an inner, intangible, shadowy sense of limitation. We don't even give ourselves the time to seriously consider which concrete consequences we may actually suffer  if  we speak out, speak joyfully of our talents, laugh too loud in public or, as women, reveal the depth of our lust (God forbid!). The list is endless. I think that for each of us, the program is a mixture of personal history, cultural encoding and - sometimes - experience.  Yes, I know. In some cases, the consequences we suffer for our actions are very tangible, very real. But my point doesn't concern the restrictions imposed by Texan legislation or the horrible state violence that drives populations worldwide into muted paralysis. I'm referring only to our inner "governments", the invisible regime of guns we point at our own heads. Loaded with fear of consequences of which we usually have no actual experience.   To some people, their "program" defines the very borders of their perception. Most of these people feel safest within that well defined space (as I guess may have been case with your grandmother).   Others, like yourself, are painfully aware of their existence. And that very awareness is the first step, I believe, if you want to un-learn. It allows you to test those subtle limitations. To take little steps ...  Therefore, you  did   post here. You did not "lurk in the shadows of a comment", although it felt more comfortable there. I  did   say to my boss "Would you please never,  ever   speak to me in that patronizing tone again!". RG  did  try the big A.   I think this forum is populated with wonderful women who need to take such little steps ... and sometimes bigger ones. How "small" or "big" they are can't be measured by a common scale. We have different programs and different circumstances within which to un-learn. Most of the time, fortunately, we find out that the consequences of taking these steps are not what we expected. There were no bad consequences. Our world just got bigger.

      Well, I didn't mean to post twice in a row so soon, but in attempting to answer RG's questions about dominance I doscovered I'd have to make about 4 or 5 comments in order to answer the questions fully. So here is the original comment I intended to make:  I'll try to answer. I'm a switch and not horribly experience in any "scene" except what I've done with my own sexual partners in the privacy of the home.  1.   When did you know you were a dominant?  I think I've always expressed it in a way- being unafraid to tell sexual partners what I want, thoroughly enjoying being on top and directing my own pleasure. But it only came out in full force when I was playing online with a friend (I guess a more crude word is 'cybering' but I hate that word so much and all the emotionless connotations that come with) anyway- he brought out in me a desire to dominate him. And so I did.  2.   Describe your first experience where you felt you exhibited dominant tendencies.  Well there's what I said above, always being unafraid to tell my partner what to do and what I wanted. It was a much moe psychological domination rather than physical.  3.   Regarding spanking, flogging, or other forms of corporal punishment, describe in detail what it makes you feel. If you are aroused by it - then why?  The only thing I really do in terms of 'punishment' is spanking. To me it's emotional- I wouldn't spank someone I didn't care deeply for. It engenders a feeling of power, that this person I am with will surrender to me and let me do something to them they would never let anyone else do. This complete surrender to pain is a beautiful thing- a pure trust. I haven't branched out to whips/flogs yet, but I might try something soon.  4.   Regarding physical restraints: Describe what you prefer and why?  Mostly what I've done so far is just hands tied to the bed. I might try Shibari sometime but I would like to learn from someone personally rather than a book- and I haven't met anyone yet.  5.  If restraints arouse you, do you know why? Well, what I really prefer is no restraints- making my partner restrain themselves. Watching their struggle to not move and knowing what will happen to them if they do. Again it's much more psychological and I love that aspect of it. The reason restraint turns me on is because I know my partner is struggling to touch, but trusting me to know when it is time for them to touch. And watching them enjoy it so much more after they've been deprived of it.  6.   Regarding control: Do you control yourself, others or both?  Well, I have a sense of self-control, but I don't know as I'd say I 'control myself.' Again, being a switch I like to be dominated just as much as I like to dominate. So I like to control others, but I like others to control me, rather than control myself, I think.  7.  What type of control do you find most effective?  Threats and physical restraint. If they do something I dislike, they get punished and they know it. If they can't restrain themselves I will restrain them.   8.  What type of control do you find most arousing?  Psychological control. Using words rather than actions. It arouses me most to know that they're controlling themselves for me and me alone.   9.  Have you ever done anything for a submissive that you found completely unarousing for you?  Not really. The point when I'm a dominant is to dominate- not to let the submissive have the control over what he/she wants. And this works for me because when we switch and I'm the submissive, then it's my turn to be unable to say what I want.  10.   Have you ever been a submissive?  Yes. I am submissive 50% of the time and dominant the other 50%. I'm a true switch, as I keep saying. (I'm not repetitive, no way).  I guess this is what you get when my boss calls me and tells me I don't have to come in for 2 more hours. :-p

      For a long time now I've been meaning to make an introduction for myself. I'm always more comfortable lurking in the shadows of comments, eventually being found out and brought to the surface by others. When rg invited me to post here I thought, 'Wow, what an honor to post amongst these strong women able to come out and tell the world who they are.' It's not that I'm afraid really, just that I was grown up taught to exhibit a false sense of modesty--but in me it has turned into something real. I'm not afraid to comment on something someone has already said, but it's so anathema to my sense of self to go around telling the world of my good qualities.   It's funny really, my maternal grandmother exhibits this in a very negative way--she will only speak negatively of herself. Never mentioning how she raised 4 children (all girls) while maintaining a healthy marriage and a job as a nurse at a local practice. She will not say, 'I did all these things on a shoestring budget and I now have 4 successful daughters and 5 successful grandchildren.' But only, 'I am so fat,' 'I am so unsuccessful.'   My mother is the exact opposite. She is never afraid of telling the world what she is and what she has done, sometimes to the point of appearing boastful. So I am stuck in the middle. I have my modesty and my discomfort at speaking about myself, and yet not wanting to seem like I am being a Negative Nellie. And I don't have the words either, I don't know where to pull out the beautiful prose like the other women here. I'm not sure where it comes from, somewhere deep down maybe that I haven't discovered for myself.  That is my Big Hush.

      I've been interested for a long time in both the physical and psychological aspects of arousal responses in humans. And, if you look on the blog-lists, what you will find is a wealth of very well-written material on what submissives get out of D/s relations.  What you get very little of is what a dominant gets out of it. And what is there tends to be very badly written. Most of the dominants who blog tend to tell you what they did, and to whom, and what the result of it was. But almost NEVER do they tell you how they felt about it; what, internally, made it good for them and why.   Is it that dominants are simply not analytical? Illiterate? Have problems expressing themselves? I don't really believe that and I hope it's not true.   So, here's my challengeto all the Doms/Dommes among you...  Ten little questions (Hush Team - feel free to add more....)  1. When did you know you were a dominant? 2. Describe your first experience where you felt you exhibited dominant tendencies. 3. Regarding spanking, flogging, or other forms of corporal punishment, describe in detail what it makes you feel. If you are aroused by it - then why? 4. Regarding physical restraints: Describe what you prefer and why? 5. If restraints arouse you, do you know why? 6. Regarding control: Do you control yourself, others or both? 7. What type of control do you find most effective? 8. What type of control do you find most arousing? 9. Have you ever done anything for a submissive that you found completely unarousing for you? 10. Have you ever been a submissive?   Of course... please feel free to comment further. And, please note that "Because it gets me hard/wet..." is not an acceptable answer. Please think about WHY it does.

       round green eyes look out over Memorial Day picnics that could feed entire villiages in Mexico  flat green lawns, manicured by small brown men greet my feet  the large pink feet that are newly hewned soft by a brand new American who is smaller than my preteen son her hands already strong as a man.  crisp green money falls from grace from the height of my shoulders that support an oily empire of greed  old rich white men cluck like chickens behind my sinful back, unmarried, slut...I can tell their wives peck them into the corner of the barnyard.   They watch my pink throat and chest while i talk to them, ignoring my green eyes that show them how we are all the same much to my disgust.

      They raised me silent.  Where I come from, everyone is. While the laws have long since flaunted independence, the people shuffle randomly in the wake of a few centuries' cultural submission. They don't speak. When the questions come, silence. When desire calls, secrecy. When progress knocks, blank stares. Absolute stillness of thought. Most of the time I believe the silence will give way to my insanity.  Other times, like tonight, it just gets lonely. Do you know what it's like to be born wailing and kicking in a place where everyone is mute? It's like being a mistake.  It isn't a romantic lonely. It isn't a gripping, urgent need for  skin on skin  and  lust on lust -- it is sheer spiritual grief.   It's mourning for all the living and longing for the lost dead fires. Where did all the voices go? Where are the revolutionaries? Where are the suffragists, the activists, the thinkers? Have they all given in to an immigration of mind?   It is thinking: am I the only one here who screams? Am I the only one here who craves the noise?  It is knowing: Yes. I'm alone.  This big hush infects them all.

      I was on  urlLink Mistress Matisse's  site (yea, I know some people don't like her but I have respect for her, she's a professional and Yen accuses me of acting submissive when I comment on her blog - probably true) and found some quotations posted there. There were a lot of good ones about BDSM - lot's of things you'd nod your head at and say... yea, how true. But one stood out as perhaps one of the 20 deepest things I think I have ever read:  "A fetish is a story masquerading as an object." --Robert Stoller  I have encountered some interesting fetishists in my life. As first I have to admit they really freaked me out - especially when I was young and had fuck all compassion. But once I got to know them better, I realized... it wasn't the shoe or the corset or the panties or the whip... It was that, at some point in there lives, they had had an experience so deep, formational, that it sculpted it's way into their very psyches. And the result was a life-long fetish for something that served as an icon, a metaphor for that whole experience. The whole of their story.   urlLink Most of the other quotes are really worth reading too....

      The "craft" made me do it.  Ok - I admit it has intrigued me for a while. A long time actually - long before it became a "mainstream" sex topic. But I had hesitations, fears and a not very healthy dose of inhibitions about it. I admit that. For all the things that don't make me inhibited, it was kind of stupid that this one did.  Yes - I'm talking the big A.  There was the BIG fear of pain. I like skin pain - quite a lot, actually. But deep pain scares me silly.  Then there was the general ickiness about, well frankly, what else went on there.  Finally, there was the physical paranoia. I had a gay godfather who had tampax in his bathroom. It freaked me out when I asked my mother what they were for and she told me.  So for years I sort of avoided the issue. And I never really had a reason to revisit it because none of the men I was with actually showed any interest at all in that particular activity.  But I knew I had to put a scene in the story - and I knew I couldn't write it without having some idea what it was like.  So I called a favour.  I call it a favour because the person who I asked really doesn't have to put up with this sort of silliness from me. But he was really the only one I trusted to do it - and without saying too much more about him personally, he knows rather a lot about it.  And then... there was the hunt for the lubricant. Let me tell you, this is REALLY hard to find where I live. I don't know how to say it for a start... and I looked it up in the dictionary and people kept pointing me to motorcycle repair shops  I found what I firmly believe to be the only exsisting tube of KY in this city. I was too scared to look at the sell by date - because it was either this or what they used in the Last Tango in Paris.  Anyway, all shopping done, condoms and KY.... a lot of funny looks from the natives; I get home and start avoiding the issue completely. Suddenly, I got really dumb and coy about it again. And he wasn't going to push the issue at all. I suspect he's actually interested to see if I'm going go through with this or not.  Well... I'm pissing around till 2 am and I finally come up into his room. He's reading and looks at me, kind of quizzically.   Let's get it over with then, I said. And he burst out laughing. He said it wasn't like I was going to be shot at dawn... and if I didn't want to - that was fine. No... (I was being my analytical best about this - it couldn't have been easy for him.)  Well, get in, he said, pulling the sheet back. And so I did. Won't go into details - cause this is actually MY life. But... it worked. Quite well actually.   If you are really turned on, it actually doesn't hurt that much - with the liberal application of goop. Of course, you really HAVE to have someone who has a modicum of control (that is actually a gross understatement). You need someone with a LOT of control, who isn't going to get carried away by the feeling and start thrusting violently... because you really have to concentrate at relaxing those muscles and keeping them that way! Otherwise, it does get a little ouchy. Also, I would definitely stay away from anyone with a really big cock.  I'm not trying to be overly coy about this... but I can tell I am attempting to do that. It was good - it was very good in fact. Look, some people may have the right nerves down there and some people might not, and it does help a lot if the person you are doing that with has his fingers permanently burried in your pussy.  But I came in about 40 seconds. I'm not kidding.  Partly just the feeling - and partly because.... Damn, that feels really submissive! When you don't have someone who keeps asking you if it still feels ok......   Right, that's my report over with... agent 99 signing out!

      Now that the TEAM (*grin*) is assembled. I thought you all better know what the title means. "This Big Hush" is the title of an old Shriekback song off the "Oil and Gold" album. It was precisely because of the myriad interpretations one could give to this title that I chose it.      Is there a fire in the sky Is there a moon up there Is anything alive now This darkness is what I hear This is a breathless silence A moment out of time I see your face in the shadows The tell-tale signs are in your eyes  More than I can hold in my hand Running through the gaps like water Aching with a passion inside Deep as the river All desire The ashes and the fire Turning this night inside And the light from you   &nbsp;   Is there a flame in the dark is there a bright heart star These creatures look the same now We freeze wherever we are We wake alone in the blackness We sleep whenever we fall One dream all around us This big hush infects us all  Holding up an animal fear Soaking up the waves underwater Tuned to music no-one can hear Forever in this half-light All desire The ashes and the fire Turning this night inside And the light from you     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &copy; Dave Allen, Barry Andrews, Martyn Barker and Carl Marsh.

      There's a tornado watch on for this part of Texas tonight, one of the  twins is a weather phobe, he's asleep on the sofa in the tv room, waiting for the end of the world via tornado. I knew I shouldn't have let them have their own copy of "Wizard of Oz" at such a young age. Live and learn. Bad mama. This is the kid that's also terrified of bees and wasps, but I think that's his father's fault, that guy is a total pussy about bees and wasps.  I'm eating a bowl of mixed nuts, grousing about my hormonal condition... wishing He was here to soothe my ruffled feathers, that are ruffled for no particular reason (except that estrogen is NOT my friend)... wondering, why don't they put more pecans in these things, pecans are the best.   I was going to play house today, but all i did was wash the little car and clean up the breakfast room. And take a 3 hour nap.    And more cashews, cashews are wonderful.   Are we allowed to post nonsence like this in here?? because I'm like totally full of nonsence about 2 weeks out of a month.   I was thinking I should come in here and write a dissertation about feminism and d/s and make a really grand entrance, but you know what? fuck it.   There's a reason why pecans are the state nut of Texas. Any state that has declared a state nut but won't allow you to own more than 3 dildos or have consentual anal sex needs stuff like a really fab state nut.  I hope i don't get banned form the blog after one day! that'd be so embarrassing!

      First, a huge thanks to remittance girl for letting me post here. It is much easier to discuss issues this way than to use the limited space in a comment box.  I think most people who are into D/s or similar sex/mind games are painfully aware that their desires can be misinterpreted badly if they are exposed in a the wrong context. There will always be an abundance of people who just don't understand the differences between ie. rape fantasies and rape per se. Imagine how the whole thing would look if you had to defend your fantasies in court after being raped for real?  I believe this lack of understanding goes for D/s too. Being a submissive in bed doesn't mean that what you  really   want deep inside is to let men control you at the office as well. On the contrary. Acknowledging who you are between the sheets (or a wide variety of other locations ;-))doesn't mean that this is also what you are everywhere else. It is a narrow and rather sad view on the whole thing.   Regarding D/s sexuality as a backlash in the relationship between men and women, as an anti-feminist return to a subdued domestic life is also utterly wrong. Submission is not weakness. For me, the proces of acknowledging my desires is so personally empowering that it is hard to describe. If anything, the honesty I find in sexual submission strengthens me more than any expensive leadership course provided my workplace could ever do. I feel liberated, balanced and empowered by it.   Why am I still in the closet, you may ask, hiding behind display names and aliases? Well, I have no wish to justify myself to people who cannot see or sense the differences discussed here. So far, this will remain a big hush!

      This is what I got - seriously - without EVEN TRYING...    LUST  "passion, awareness, aliveness"  You exhibit an excitement and enthusiasm about life as well as multi-faceted creativity.  You have the gifts of perception, extended vision, insight, and intuition and display an eagerness to display your full creative expression.  You have the ability to fully express yourself, free of lies and masks and falsehoods.  You can overcome your fears using your creativity, as shown by the woman on the card.    urlLink   which major arcana of the thoth tarot deck are you?  short, with pictures and detailed results     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       urlLink Bliatz  wrote this:   The fact that I'm a natural born "top" out of bed may - if analyzed - on some deeply psychological level relate to the fact that I may also be a natural born "bottom" in bed.    I've actually never heard this stated better or more succinctly. And I think if you asked most "sexually submissive" women - at least 50% would ascribe to this statement.  It is precisely because I spend most of my life voluntarily taking on huge amounts of responsibilities, that I crave the luxury of having no control sexually. And I cannot tell you how many people have met me and thought, fantasized even about how much of a "tiger" I must be in the sack. I've had people say it to my face!

      The initial results of "cum on the face" poll have been very interesting indeed - and quite polarized. Rounding it off to the nearest whole number, they are as follows:  37% were very aroused by it 10% found it somewhat arousing 16% were ambivalent about it 5% only allowed it because their partner liked it 32% hated it  This is pretty good news for guys who get off on it, since a total of 63% either liked it or it didn't bother them.  On the other hand, 37% either hated it or only did it because their partner liked it. This isn't a small percentage!  So, unless you know for sure, before you go and do it, perhaps you better ask?  :-)  rg (any ideas on a new poll?)

      Whenever I have received compliments for my felatio technique I always give credit where credit is due - to my best friend who is a gay male and was kind enough to give me the inside story from the horse's (or cocksucker's) mouth.

      I think, because role-playing online is such a guilty pleasure for most people who indulge, not much has been written on the do's and dont's of it.  I actually think that online rping is a lovely way to weave a story, use your imagination and getting off all that the same time. However, this depends totally on both people being willing to participate in the story-building and being descriptive in their use of language.  So here is a good example of how not to do it (IM username withheld out of compassion)- keep in mind, this was not a person poping up in a chat room, this person IM'd me direct - out of the blue:   player  (10:27:38 AM): wanna play?  remittance_girl  (10:27:42 AM): sure  player  (10:28:09 AM): what roles?  remittance_girl  (10:28:22 AM): You choose!   player  (10:30:49 AM): what ya up for  remittance_girl  (10:31:47 AM): LOL - that is a clever but ineffective way around you choosing!  player  (10:31:59 AM): damn it  player  (10:32:01 AM): uh  player  (10:32:19 AM): your sizing me for a suite  player  (10:32:22 AM): ?  remittance_girl  (10:32:33 AM): a suite?  player  (10:32:48 AM): a tux  remittance_girl  (10:32:57 AM): Oh - a suit?  player  (10:33:20 AM): yeah  remittance_girl  (10:33:38 AM): ok  player  (10:33:51 AM): ok  remittance_girl  (10:34:03 AM): So - you come in because you have an appointment for a sizing... and I'm new  remittance_girl  (10:34:17 AM): Goodmorning, Sir!  player  (10:34:36 AM): hi  remittance_girl  (10:34:49 AM): Have you an appointment, Sir?  player  (10:35:07 AM): yes  remittance_girl  (10:35:29 AM): are you going to play?  player  (10:35:40 AM): yeah  remittance_girl  (10:35:41 AM): try a little dialogue - it helps!  remittance_girl  (10:35:59 AM): And what is your appointment for, SIr?  player  (10:36:11 AM): sizing  remittance_girl  (10:37:07 AM): A fitting for what. Sir? Shirt? Uniform? Suit?, Riding Clothes?  player  (10:37:21 AM): suit  remittance_girl  (10:37:46 AM): ok... a suit! Well, that would be me Sir.  remittance_girl  (10:38:02 AM): Please step right this way, through to the fitting room  player  (10:38:04 AM): ok  player  (10:38:18 AM): walks back  remittance_girl  (10:38:22 AM): Now, Sir.. what kind of a suit are we looking for today  remittance_girl  (10:38:25 AM): ?  player  (10:39:04 AM): one for a wedding black  remittance_girl  (10:39:18 AM): and are you a guest or the groom Sir?  player  (10:40:08 AM): groom  player  (10:40:56 AM): .......  remittance_girl  (10:41:27 AM): Ok... you know what? I'm into playing out a fantasy - because I get off on that. However, your one-word answers are not actually getting me anywhere and, since I''m not getting paid for this and I'm not an online hooker, I really don't have to play with you.  *sigh* If you are so horny that you can't bother typing even at the very begining - you are already too far gone to rp - just wank by yourself (you're most of the way there anyway).  rg

       actually not crowds at all, but I'm a sucker for Elias Canetti.   OK - has anyone here guessed that I don't suffer from confrontation aversion?  This piece should actually be entitled   Power and Control  .  I will posit this for your enjoyment: In a relationship between a submissive and a dominant, ultimately it is the submissive who wields the most power.  I am tempted to justify that statement but I will abstain and see what the storm washes up.  rg

      All this intellectual discussion, while being absolutely fascinating, has me totally overwhelmed, so I'll just talk about myself, its the simplest thing I can think of. I've been out of the academic arena for 15 years, so even tho we are discussing sex and S&M the heavy layers are hard for me to wade thru, appologies. The kids, the job, the world... you know?  So about me... I was married to a doctor for a long time, he was bottom. And he was so overbearing and demanding, he made me Top. The backass way. I think its called Topping from the bottom, and all agree, its a bad idea. We've been divorced a while now and he's with this really brassy dominate woman who's making him delightfully happy, and I'm so grateful. I'm professinally very outgoing, I have a "large presence", so my not being Top has always been an enigma. Doc couldn't accept it, he "knows I'm a strong woman." So he tried to make me be his Top.  Since that was forced Topping, and I didn't enjoy it, it was never discussed or planned, I'm not going to address it... I'm here to talk about Wolfgang.  Wolfgang was my one big hurrah as pro Domme. We met in NYC, I flew from Texas and he from Cologne, Germany and had spent months negotiating...I'd done alot of research. I was dealing with coming out (to myself even) as a very submissive woman. I ended up using the event with Wolfgang to determin whether or not I was really submissive. The whole thing, from selecting my clothes and "image" to the implements of his torture was enforcing for me that I'm not the Top, I'm the bottom, in so many ways.  I selected a mahogany hairbrush to spank him with. And while I was using it on him, I was constantly afraid I was hurting him. Of course, I wasn't, he was SO digging it, the cum leaking out of him was the best sign of that, but even that, knowing that I was totally turning him on wasn't making me feel good. I was happy to be making him feel good, but it wasn't putting me in a good place, personally, sexually. Also his reaction, was non reaction, he didn't squeal or jump or fight, I've always liked that part of the corporal punishment scene, it completes the stroke for me.  I tied Wg with silk scarves, ankle and wrist to the hotel bed frame and then hog style afterwards. I selected these because they'd be easier to travel with and for the  feel of them. Silk is very strong. But I was careful not to cut off his circulation or harm him permanently. I used my belt about his neck to tug him around and secure him and let him feel the leather.  Restraints have always aroused me. I love the symbolism of it, ownership, like a prize dog. Identity, pride. I kept Wolfgang in his quasi collar the whole time, carefully telling him the meaning of it to me. I led him around like a dog and talked to him the way I train one of my own labs. Firm but consistent, fair but stern. Demanding. Loving.  I've always been a huge fan of self control. I control myself rather famously, if I do say so myself. And I controlled Wg that time too. I am a big girl. Six feet in heels and strong. Surely he could have overpowered me, if he'd been inclined, but he wasn't, and I worked out constantly and he sat at a desk all day, so I was more of a match for him. We did tussle a bit, but he was easy enough to subdue. I kept him tied and whipped after that, so he was less inclined to fight.    The whole thing was a watermark in his life, no bragging here, he TOLD me this. He asked me to come to Germany and marry him, I declined, politely. Watermark for him, but it just left me tired. Seriously, instead of seeing friends in NYC the next day, I slept most of the day and missed the show I had tickets for. I was so worn out.  I did not orgasm from the event, not once. I did like him begging to lick and suck on my feet. I did not let him. But had his reaction been different to the beating, I think I might have enjoyed it more, if he'd screamed or struggled......in effect done what *I* do. I know that's not fair, but its honest.  I gave that boy a beating that would have made every man in Texas cry like a baby and he just lay there like a big old German sausage. I was totally disgusted. I decided there that a crop or cane would be necessary if i ever decided to Top again. Hard to carry on the airplane, but very very necessary.   At this point, I'd like to add that when I'm done being the pet (our code for what we do), I'm energized and I feel really great. Not tired or done.....I usually feel like I could do it some more, in fact. I never want to be the Top again. And once I admitted this to myself, finding the other half of my sky was as simple as walking into a party room and bumping into him. I think it was Zen surrender, of a fashion. I had to totally surrender what I thought I was supposed to be for alot of other people and just be me. But I am happy to have given Wolfgang a big memory. I spoke to him the other night and he said how he'd been thinking of me.....and that was nice, but the real me is somebody he's never known and probably wouldn't know what to do with anyway.  So that's my little Domme dissertation. Such as it is :)  btw, I LOVE for him to cum on my face, tummy, chest, everywhere, its not degrading for me at all, not with him. Its fabulous, a MAJOR turn on. I want it everywhere and for him to rub it in. And so he does.   The right person for Mr. Frog is Mrs. Frog.

      Because you asked -   RG and I had a very long conversation regarding the misogyny issue, and I think the conflict of opinions was due largely to the fact that we defined a lot of things differently. For that reason I'm including my own definitions.   Misogyny  -  hatred  of women (I actually looked this one up. It's HATRED, not prejudice, not disrespect, not dislike.)  Hatred  - intense dislike;  actively  wishing the object harm/displeasure * Four elements in the range of emotion: dislike, hate, like, and love * Indifference is indepedent of all four.   The scenario : A hates B. A cums on B's face in an effort to cause her displeasure. B gets off on it. A observes B's arousal. A cums on B's face again.   The question : Was the second act one of misogyny?  My answer : It depends on A's intentions before he came the second time.    The possibilities: (How did A react to B's getting aroused by the initial act of misogyny?)   1. A sees B's obvious pleasure and cums on her face for the purpose of giving her pleasure again. --  NOT  misogyny. I don't think this one needs to be explained. 2. A simply could not care less about whether or not B got aroused. It doesn't matter - it's his pleasure that does. --  NOT  misogyny. This is indifference, not hatred. 3. A doesn't like that B got aroused, but decides that as long as HE gets to do to this bitch what he wants, he can handle her experiencing some pleasure. --  NOT  misogyny. This is dislike/disrespect, not hatred. Still wrong, but it is less in degree. 4. A is infuriated and sickened by B's response, and resolves to step up the abuse until B feels displeasure. -  MISOGYNY . This is hatred.  To clarify: I  don't  believe that a crime is defined by the reaction of a victim to it. I believe it's the intention of the victimizer that matters.  However , in a case like this where the victimizer is made aware of the victim's pleasure before committing the act in question AND where the crime involves hate, I think it's important to take into consideration the effect of the victim's reaction on the victimizer's intention.  *Head spin* Three in fifteen in the morning and I'm still up turning this over in my head... Thanks, RG. You and your sperm. ;)

      Although certain people do not find the idea of being pissed on degrading, I would bet that the vast majority of people do. I am not judging people's preferences at all. I'm just asking them to be honest.  I am personally NOT interested in having someone's bodily waste on my body. That's why I didn't have children.  I'm not all that interested in having someone's sperm OR their blood all over me either. Specifically because both are tremendously good vehicles for the transmission of AIDS and Hepatitis. On a personal level, I find blood very arousing - but for health reasons, I abstain from playing with it.  Other than health reasons, I have no particular objection to sperm - I'm totally ambivalent about it - it neither interests me nor puts me off. I don't perceive of sperm as being symbolic of pleasure - orgasms and ejaculations do not always coincide - so I simply perceive it as a byproduct. However, I'm perfectly prepared to look absolutely thrilled about it - if it will make HIM feel better about it.  But to deny that any of these fluids carry very heavy symbolic meanings for most people, would be foolish. And so the intention with which either urine or sperm or blood is transferred must also, for many people, carry meaning.  In answer to Bliatz's question; "But is it an act of degradation, if the woman loves it and has no idea of the meanings he attaches to it?"  I would pose a question to answer yours: If a Black or Asian person is treated in a racist manner behind their back, and they don't know about it, is it still racism?  My answer to both questions is YES.  Degrading another human being is only ever acceptable if the person being degraded is fully aware and gives their permission.  rg

      Thanks for bringing up yet another interesting and mind boggling subject, RG!!  I'm a link whore! I usually write "Cum in my face" or something similar in my posts in order to get as many hits from Google as possible. No, I don't, really, but I think we've all seen in our stats how popular such phrases are. Sperm seems to be a very strong symbol, which can be invested with so many meanings. I don't believe there's a fixed answer here ... it all depends on people and context.   I think that, yes, to some men, shooting their sperm in the face of a woman  is  a misogynist act. It is an act of degradation by smearing something in her face which the man himself defines as dirty. But is it an act of degradation, if the woman loves it and has no idea of the meanings he attaches to it?   To other men, sperm seems to have a strong visual effect as a symbol of intense arousal and climax. And, if they like having a look at that, then shooting it into her - and losing sight of it for good - is kind of ... wasteful. A little childish, perhaps, kind of "Whhhooaaaa .. here I goooo!" That's the wholesome, healthy type shooters.  The meaning of sperm also varies when it comes to women. I think a lot of women would never allow for a man to place his load anywhere else than "in the proper place"!! Those women attach a lot of negative value to it, regardless of how the man feels about his product. Maybe that's why men find women who likes sperm particularly sexy? Because they don't regard their proud load as an abomination?  In many cases, the significance may depend on the way sperm is used and understood within the sexual act itself. It's meaning is created by the man and woman together. And there's no doubt that this meaning changes, when it is not shot into the woman, but somewhere on her instead. Here, I think the significance varies immensely, so in this, I can only draw from my own experiences. To me, getting cum in my face is - at times - a very submissive act. It is not so as a degrading act, but as a rewarding one, of sorts. Sometimes, it's a strong "Good girl"-symbol to me. I did well. At other times it's just, well, very, very arousing! The feeling, the smell, the taste of sperm is deeply erotic, and I enjoy feeling it spurted into me, or anywhere else. I can do this because he does  not  regard it as dirty in any way. On the contrary. And that way it leaves the arena of misogyny and becomes a "clean" symbol for us to play with. It is a good sex toy!  Maybe one can tell "the misogynist asshole" from "the pleasure shooter" by following this general rule of conduct: If he is disgusted with the idea of touching it himself, he sure ain't gonna shoot any at you either! If he doesn't even wanna lick your pussy if there's any trace of his own sperm there, then what exactly does it signify to him, when he wants you to lick it off your face??  And PS: Piss is different!!!!!

      Yes, I always bring up the wierd topics... and this one is on... you guessed it, SPERM.  I have noticed a subtle but definite attitude change to sperm (CUM - if you're a cs'er)over the last 5 years. It seems that sperm has become a fetish item. For example:  And then I'll cum all over you, spurting my cum all over your belly, over your breasts, all over your pretty little face.  Then I'll leave you there, tied up on the bed like that, naked, wet and trembling, my cum dripping down your body    (I'm not picking on you  urlLink Roger  - actually, I am because your ego is not nearly as fragile as a lot of men out there - and I know you won't take this the wrong way. You are a consumate lover of women - that is a given!)   And I notice that when I write stories, men REALLY like it when I mention that cum has strayed from which ever orifice it was supposedly aimed at and has ended up some place visible; her face, her hair, her breasts - seldom is anyone turned on by it ending up on her hands, I notice....  Now, if this is a sign of men freeing themselves from some misplaced feelings of shame about their sperm - a liberation, if you would ("Love Me, Love My Sperm..."); I'm perfectly ok with that. I think it's good; healthy even. It's not like women are the only gender with inhibition problems.  But, from time to time, I do get the feeling that there is more than a little misogyny lurking behind the references. That, in fact, there is still a feeling that sperm is somehow "dirty" and that spraying it all over a girl's face is just a baby-step up from pissing on her. That it is simply degradation in disguise.  The thing is, intention is all important here because I have no problem with a man feeling good about his sperm... but I'm not into watersports or degradation.  Ladies.... why not take the poll?  ( And for the record, I don't think Roger is in the least bit a misogynist! I love his blog and it turns me on immensely which is why he is one of the few men with a link here!!!...  phew... OK???)

      For me, it's all about control.  I've known for a while that I'm strangely preoccupied with the two most powerful experiences in the world. One is giving birth. The thought of my participation in the very act of creation holds incredibly appeal for me: the nine months of suffering and preparation, the need for mental focus, the hours of labor -- and finally, the cries of a life  I  introduced into the universe. It's a strictly female ability, and I love being a woman because of it. I believe women hold tremendous sway over the affairs of men by virtue of their capability to create, and I enjoy immensely having that power.  (To the men here: neener neener neener!)   The other experience, however, is one that belongs exclusively to men: sex. The overwhelming  control  they are granted by the simple fact that they were born with cocks. As  urlLink Roger  eloquently articulated in the comments to the previous post, the one with the cock gets to dictate almost everything: physical responses, pleasure, speed, urgency, intensity. Although a woman is involved, she is largely passive. I don't mean that all women lie limply in the grasp of the thrusting male-- I mean that her role is much more transitive. When it comes to actual intercourse, she is receptacle and receiver, and not much more. The control is his, all his, and I want it.  Hence my fascination with owning a cock.  For me, the physical aspect of experiencing penetration from the other side doesn't come into the picture at all. I think the roles of a man and a woman during sex determine,  to a certain degree , the gender roles outside of it (Yes, RG, I realize I turn everything into metaphors ;) ). I love being creator, but I wonder what it would be like to extend that control past creation.  I think a woman with a cock could rule the world.

      Firstly - a big thanks to Yen for editing the template and getting rid of the banner; we'll see what blogspot has to say about it, I suppose.  Yen and I have had a number of conversations about this and the topic has come up on  urlLink SubRosa 's blog as well.  I would willingly give up the use of a limb, to have a penis.   This doesn't mean I want to be a man - I don't. My fascination is with penetration; the act; it's attendant feelings both physically and emotionally.  I have often been a non-participant during intercourse simply because I was so busy trying to worm my consciousness into my partner's head and piggy-back on his sensations. And at times, I really do feel I have caught a glimpse of what it must be like. The sensation of pushing a very sensitized part of your body into something wet and warm and tight; not to mention the rather nice reaction your partner has to it.   I have often asked... at the moment, at the initiation of the act: "Tell me please, what does it feel like?" Responses have ranged from the non-verbal groan (no, I didn't keep him around long) to the more eloquent 'grin of insanity', to the incredibly forthcoming: "Oh... it feels.... fucking amazing." None of these really gave the the in-depth description I was looking for. Oh, well.  Yup - I want it - the feeling, the power, the ability to thrust! OK - who'll trade?  I'm offering a pair of very attractive, medium-sized breasts with nicely sensitive nipples for a penis - any takers?  rg

      What must it be like?  To have her emotional distance, her measured smile -- the one whose silence burns you into insecurity? Her ability to lace every innocuous word with innuendo, dripping slowly between your legs in amusement at your frustration? Her speed, matching that of your impatience, ebbing and flowing to infuriate you?  To claim her with a word? To know that you can make her throb with a well-placed stare? To bring her pride to its knees before you, begging shamelessly?  To admire the shine of her hair as she shakes at your feet, trembling under your control? To watch her face contort in all the frequencies of emotion? To witness the birth of her submission as its cries warm the air? To watch the peace ripple through her body in stages: her fine hairs standing on end, a shiver, a violent shudder, an enveloping calm?   To observe with awe the phases of her surrender, each barrier falling in a unique obeisance? To know, as she lies helpless and innocent under you, her eyes wide and trusting, that it was  YOUR  doing,  YOUR  control,  YOU  who took her to this place?  Do you wonder, as I do, what it must be like on the other side?  Do you crave sometimes, as I do, the power of that experience?

      Gen X shoutouts. She was escourted into her sexuality by Madonna and Prince. Her first orgasm was at 9 years old during the act of relieving herself outdoors because the wind blew just right. She pacified herself with her thumb until the age of fifteen. Father never loved her.....  Her first lover was chosen the very same night in her teenage years that she discovered the direct corrilation between beer and cigarettes. His words lingered like a noose around her neck as he coaxed her into relaxation deflowering her without ever climaxing because he was too high on cocaine.  She wishes she could sing. Like Diana Krull.  She enjoys pleasing men and the power it gives her.  She envies Monica Lewinsky.  She should have told him that even though she was physically giving him head under a full moon at the edge of a pier on the Atlantic she was mentally four paces back watching the two of them together beacuse she was a vouyer.  She enjoys clean areas. Clean your area. NOW. She collects music boxes and russian nesting dolls. She misses her distinctive Hungarian maiden name. That has reappeared due to error on her driver's license. To his dismay, she hasn't made the changes.

      it just kept coming and coming.  Something that started off as a short story, posted a while ago to this very blog, burrowed itself like a greedy tick and started sucking the life out of me... I just had to keep writing it.   Now it has a life of it's own, at   urlLink The Waiting Room .   That doesn't mean I've stopped writing Divestiture... but I was very blocked on how to proceed with that story, so I thought a little soujourn somewhere completely different might be the distance I required.

      I can really only understand this through the lens of my limited personal experience, which amounted to half a dozen sessions over the course of a couple of months.  It was absolutely not in the context of a 24/7 D/S relationship.  Like many others here, I don't think I could tolerate that.  (Something just occurred to me.  As a community for the "The Thinking Submissive" we may be selecting away from submissives who would enjoy this.  Not that they don't think, but that they aren't the sort that would choose the word "thinking" FIRST.  I'm a feeling and emoting submissive too, but I would describe myself as a thinking submissive before using those words.)  She called it "slave training", which means many different things to many different people.  It was something I asked for not really knowing what it was.  She had spoken about it before and it was clear that it was pretty close to the heart of her personal kink.  Her enthusiasm for it made me want to try it just to please her.  She was very skilled in pavlovian and operant conditioning.  She had already used these skills to train me, unasked, into a fetish for golden showers.  The training was tedious.  She picked a difficult task and watched over me like a hawk while I did it.  One day she had me re-arrange her dungeon.  And then arrange it all back.  If I made a mistake I got punished.  The mistake might be not following instructions properly.  But it might be for something she never specifically told me (walking too loudly).  There was never any variation in the punishment.  She scolded me and hit the soles of my feet with a cane.  I'm sure she picked it because she knew I genuinely hated it.  The reward was even simpler.  She just praised me nicely and used my name (which she never used otherwise once she started the training).  It was oddly satisfying to go home after a session in which I had done well, which was usually.  I think, but am not sure, that she made a point of ending the sessions on a note of accomplishment.  The weirdest thing is that I ended up jonesing (hey, it was New York so I can use that word) for the reward really badly between sessions.  Our sessions ended when she moved away.  I don't think I would have continued much longer anyway.  It was interesting, but I wasn't really enjoying it.  Also, it didn't feel at all like I was surrendering to her, which I need to feel.  Does anybody else have an experience with this?

      (or: Hell Just Seems Funner)  Even though I am a died in the wool atheist, I actually break some of the 10 commandments on purpose every now and then, just in case the Christians are right.  Because the idea of spending eternity sitting at the right hand of God and playing the fucking harp is probably one of the most terrifying prospects in the Universe.  I feel the same way about traditional 24/7 D/s set-ups. I know... there will be a chorus of people who will now turn around and accuse me of being a pseudo-sub. But the idea of spending any more than about 5 minutes on my knees, eyes down, pretending to be a non-person is enough to make me slit my throat and bleed all over your nice persian rug. (and if you don't think I actually would do it out of spite, you don't know me very well - death doesn't scare me - boredom does.)  The utter boredom is more than I can even contemplate. So is sitting peacefully at someone's side with a collar on at something resembling a convention; being an asset to my Master. The phrase intellectual suicide comes to mind.   Look, I know a lot of people get very deeply into it. And I am really, really happy for them.  But before I even contemplate anything that unsuitable for me, shoot me first. You'll be neater.  Whoa...where did all that hostility come from you may well ask... I've just spent the last 5 hours editing a story involving a woman who comes to realize that the natural and god-commanded place for a woman is kneeling by her husband's feet at the dinner table, being fed scraps when he feels generous or acting as a recepticle for his sperm irregardless of her own pleasure. She cums at the thought of merely being used by him or whomever he might decide to throw her to like a bone. (If the thought of this is turning you on, just don't tell me about it tonight, OK? By tomorrow I am sure to be more open-minded)  Of course... this does beg the question of what is god's plan for lesbians - sub or Dom and male submissives - (oh, right, they are the devil's spawn, I forgot!)

      What novels appeal to your submissive side?  I'm most interested in hearing about books in which the BDSM is overt rather than sublimated.  Do you re-read these books?  Do they take you someplace different than submitting in real life?    Don't be shy about listing your guilty pleasures.  If you like it  despite  the fact that it's awful, then some aspect of it must be  very  appealing.  Since it's my idea, I'll go first: I'm fond of Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel Novels.   urlLink Kushiel's Dart  is the first book in the trilogy.  I like the heroine.  She's submissive, narcissistic, a born masochist, and incredibly strong.  I'll mention a few more later if they don't show up on somebody else's list.

      And wouldn't you all be surprised?  Men and women REALLY disagree on this one, because I found an almost identical poll over at  urlLink Now Tease Me  (which by the pics, I would assume is very, very vanilla and aimed primarily at men)   Our Poll asking who does what  (I'm assuming that mostly women answered):  32%  Shave some public hair  27%  Trim  22%  Shave it all off  13%  Leave it the way nature gave it to them  4.5%  Wax Partially (I think that was just me - no it really doesn't hurt)  0%  Wax it all   His Poll Asking Preferences  (I'm assuming that mostly men answered)  56%  Want it shaved smooth  22%  Want it half shaved (and tif you go to the site, you'll see that it means leaving a little on top and the labia completely shaved)  20%  Like it hairy.  I have asked a lot of men why they prefer a woman to be shaved - the answer is always the same: they don't like pubic hair in their teeth when they eat pussy.  Now, let me say a few words about shaving your pubic hair off living in a very hot, humid country: rashes, ingrown hairs, fungal infections. And that is just as long as you don't knick yourself.  So if it's just going down on with pubic hair that you object to, I'll gladly forego the pleasure.  Because no one, no matter how perfect a dominant, no matter how attractive or sexy; GOD himself could not compel me to shave it off again. Seriously, I would happily stay celiabate the rest of my natural born days and just buy a lot of nice toys rather than take a razor to my twat again. I wax it neatly and then I trim it well. But that's all.

      I've mentioned before that I get really annoyed with online chat that includes the statement that "I love everything" or "You can do anything to me". I'm certain that everybody DOESN'T love everything  that I could come up with, in fact, part of me wants to deliberatly horrify those people who suggest that they'd blindly follow me along which ever perverted path I would choose.   But I've also realized in the past few days that i'm not sure where my limits would be with Jon, aka, The One. He's never pushed me that far.   I think, I'm not much of a kisser (its always kind of grossed me out, actually) and then i find myself sucking on his lips and tongue like i'm starving. I think, he's too big and too strong for me to want his weight on me, his hands around my throat, then i beg him to mount me and hold me tightly. And His hand closing around my throat makes me cum. His bites make me shudder with orgasm. His body pushing me into the mattress makes me feel loved and protected in a way i never felt before.  I've never been one for public display, but i gladly wear his collar when we get away from this little Baptist/Republican town, i revel in his attaching my ankle cuffs around the table leg at a swank sushi retaurant AND LEAVNG ME THERE WHILE HE WASHES HIS HANDS. When He unfastened me at meal's end and praised me as His "Good pet", i felt reborn. I want to hold His hand, but i want more for Him to grasp my wrist and lead me where He wants me. I want to be lead by Him.  So here i am with all this conflicted information, what i want, what i like, what i *thought* i wanted. What i REALLY want. I used to be pretty sure i knew what i would and wouldn't do, now i'm not so sure. And i'm not sure that's a bad thing.  When do you stop? personally, where do you all draw the line?  Because i'm thinking, its really blurred for me lately.

      I read an interesting post and then a nice little comment storm that followed over on  urlLink My 2 Doms , and it got me thinking about body image.  I was born small - REALLY small - and, at a last check, I was 5'2". I inherited my bodyshape from my parents - both ectomorphs (skinny like beanpoles). So for years I scampered around looking like a little boy - elvish would be a good description. No hips, no tits, no ass. Clothes look great on me - but I didn't feel "female" at all. This had a lot to do with were I grew up. In Spain, at the time, if a woman did not have big broad hips, voluptious breasts and a sizeable ass...well, they just weren't REAL women - and certainly not bedable.  Then, of course, I came to the "civilized world" and saw people who spent copious amounts of money and tears on trying to get skinny. I was even more confused when all the skinny girls had to rush out and buy tits - because having lost all the body fat, they didn't actually have any.  However, one woman actually kind of settled the whole issue for me. I had a female lawyer as a boss for a while. She was Scottish/Metis. She stood about 5'10", with raven black hair down to her ass (which she would wear up when working). She was big. Not just big boned, this girl was well over 230 lbs. But she never covered it. She always wore snugg, body hugging suits, very high heels and she moved like a stalking tigeress. I actually watched her walk into a boardroom full of men once and spotted 4 serious erections in the crowd and those were the men who's jackets were unbuttoned. Outside of fantasy or porn, it is really rare to see men react that instantly to a woman - just on sight. But you would have thought she walked into that room naked. Plus, they stared and when she would address one of them, shit - they actually got kind of little boyish with her. She was carrying around so much power.   It was very simple really: she adored her own body. She seriously thought she was the sexiest woman alive. She acted like it, she moved like it, she breathed her own sensuality. A mutual friend once described her to me as "walking vulva".  Some time after I stopped working for her, we met up for drinks and I actually asked her... How did she think she ended up with such a good body image. She ascribed it to her father. She said that all through growing up, he had been profuse in his praise of her body. She made it quite clear that there was nothing even approximating incest involved. But, perhaps because he wasn't uncomfortable admiring her body, she grew up feeling the same way.  Sadly, my father was just the opposite. The minute I even began to look the least bit...mature, he totally withdrew. In fact, he actively encouraged me, during adolescence to be ashamed of my body. In retrospect, I think maybe this was because he was ashamed of his reactions to it.  The one very good thing about being a submissive, is that you get this unique opportunity to go back in time and re-learn some of the self-esteem you didn't get the first time around.   But ultimately - if you think you're sexy - other people do too.

      I had an epiphany of sorts this weekend and pulled out my compact mirror from my purse so I could see his thick purple cock sliding in and out of my mouth (which is usually attributed as being my best facial feature, although The One might disagree).  I was so aroused by the look of my mouth, and his cock, the image has stayed with me. i think His cock is beautiful and He's told me that my mouth is beautiful. Together the reflection was such a huge visual, i may never be the same again.   Clearly, it has become worship for me, for us. Oral-genital contact was never this satisfying before. As trite as it sounds, i feel like a virgin with Him, each time. i've forgotten that i ever did it with another person.....nothing could have prepared me for this level of intensity and devotion.

      For as long as I can remember, images of girls tied up by villains and held for ransom or laid across the train tracks made we feel kind of strange but nice inside. And, being analytical from a very young age, at about 14 I thought that I probably had some “sicko” fetish for abduction.  As I got a bit older, I noticed that I was sexually attracted to people who had extremely strong personalities; who, in effect, dominated me mentally. I didn’t link this with the abduction thing at all. And having grown up in a VERY feminist environment, I just thought this was a comment on what a “bad” feminist I really was.  Luckily, as it turned out, the people I met who could “dominate” me mentally never seemed very attracted to me. I say “luckily” because, I was so unformed as a personality then, I don’t think I would have been able to identify my own consensuality at all.  So… for many years, I simply went along thinking that I was a sicko and a bad feminist.  This resulted in two very good things, believe it or not. First, it drove me to be very interested in fetish and obsessive behaviour; I read a lot, watched a lot, thought a lot about it. It made me a much more accepting person of other people’s kinks than I would have ever been otherwise. Second, my self-identification as a “bad” feminist spurred me into a study of feminism that made me a militant one.   So now I was enlightened: exploring the dimensions of the “fetish”, I realized that it wasn’t one – because it was far too unfocused and too broad to be a “fetish”. And I was a strident feminist – I still am - and a proud one. But still, I didn’t have a word for what I was…except that whatever it was, I was in the closet about it; I was a “closet” something and I was utterly disgusted with myself for it. So I completely stomped on every twinge of attraction I had for anyone who I felt was dominant at all. That wasn’t hard because, as I mentioned before, those kind of people never seemed to be attracted to me.  Then, at the age of about 22, I had a one night stand. I kind of knew this guy, he’d been on the fringes of the music scene I was in for a while; he was really nice and even a little shy. It wasn’t like I had any serious feelings for him, he was peripheral to the “scene” I was in. But it was 2 in the morning and the club was closing and we’d been chatting and he was pleasing to the eye and he asked it he could come back to my place and… yeah well.  Everything went normally until we were actually in bed and naked. All of a sudden the guy just switched. One minute he was the cute hesitant, fumbling kisser, totally sensitive-new-agey kind of foreplay guy… and the next, BANG, he flipped me onto my  stomach (not at all gently), put his knees between my legs and, well… stuff ensued. He wasn’t in the least bit violent, but all his actions were VERY definite, very controlled and very controlling. I think I remember putting up a fight for about 2 minutes before I just  blissed right out .  In that first two minutes, the two halves of my brain were having completely separate conversations. One half was saying, “OK, I know this isn’t rape – but it’s DEFINITELY false advertising! This isn’t the way a guy who has any respect for you relates to you physically.”   The other half was having far less concrete thoughts but they were running along the lines of: “Oh, god…this is good…please don’t stop.” Shortly after these fragmented thoughts…I lost my mind completely. What I realized, many years later, was that this guy, without pain or significant force and long before the sex began, took me into subspace so fast… well, there is a Bowie lyric, from the song ‘the Bewley Brothers’, that describes it perfectly: “…he could scream and still relax…unbelieveable.”  By the time the morning rolled around and he sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and asking rather hesitantly if I would give him my phone number and did I want to go out clubbing that night again, the “good feminist” fairy was firmly back in control. And she was saying: “nobody who fucks you that way can actually really LIKE you.”  I politely but firmly rejected him and any suggestion of further association, and spent the next year trying to avoid him socially. The worst thing about it was that, if I did happen to catch a glance of him out somewhere, I would get instantly wet.   Conflicted doesn’t begin to describe what I felt and, still, I didn’t have a name for it.  But I knew one thing for sure: it wasn’t the sex, it was the power.  I won’t go on to tell you when I found a name for it, or what my first identified experience was – that would really take a huge post.   But I will say that I have never stopped being conflicted about it. My feminist fairy and my submissive slut side still war all the time. I know this would be intolerable for some people. But for me, the fact that I constantly challenge my submissive inclinations means that it is ALWAYS consensual and that I ALWAYS take responsibility for the relinquishing of my power. And this is the person I can live with – the honest one who isn’t a victim and always has the choice.  The only problem is... it makes me a very complicated sub.

      MB (the woman who owns me) and I were chatting over some sushi when, out of nowhere, this question pops out of my mouth.  She knew exactly what I was talking about.  She wasn't sure exactly when, but it was much earlier for her than it was for me.  I remember vague fantasies when I was 19.  I remember always being sexually drawn to strong people.  I always thought being tied up was the best sex game.  For a long time, I thought it was merely something that turned me on.  There were plenty of other things that turned me on, so there was no need to pursue something I couldn't even name.  There were hints that I should have picked up on, including a spectacularly bad acid trip with a woman who would have gladly dominated me if I had known how to tell her what I craved.  Instead the inexpressibility of my desire took me to a very bad place.    I finally figured it out in my mid 20s.  I saw a professional domme and my entire life changed.  For weeks afterwards, I was a different person.  I was more focused at work.  I got along better with friends and family.  When the need came back, I knew what it was and how to deal with it.    When did you realize that your submission was more than a game?  How did you figure it out?

      Firstly, I'd like to clear something up. I know I was a little curt with Urban Stud in my reply to his comment in the last post. And I apologize for it. Also, I do thank him for his suggestions, as you can see... cos I took one to heart; the new poll on shaving is up!  However, this blog is subtitled " The thinking submissive " and not " How to please a Dominant ". There are a number of reasons for this:   1.  Although a majority of submissives are primarilyheterosexual, I would very much like to make gay and lesbian submissives feel included in these discussions.  2.  There are a lot of sites on the net that focus on how to please men - in fact, there's a whole mega industry set up for it - and they do a much better job of a subject like that than I could ever do. The focus of this blog in discussing sex acts is on raising comfort levels and challenging myths. It is not about encouraging people to do things they don't want to do.   3.  It's about discussing the pleasures but also the boundaries of submission and validating them. I want to make sure that no one reading this blog gets the feeling that they are a "bad" submissive because there are things they don't like or won't do.   4.  The focus is really on how being a submissive affects the women and men who are.   5.  Only submissives really truly have any inkling of kind of conflicting pressures acting upon them in society: defending their choices in the face of traditional feminist doctrine AND defending their boundaries in their relationships with Dominants.  This does not mean that I don't invite and appreciate the input and comments of Dominants both male and female. I think pretty well every one of the participants appreciate them. But I am more likely to cut you off if I think your comments are skewing the direction of the blog into areas that don't fit into one of the above areas.  Again, I love your participation and thank you for it!   rg

      A romantic relationship, while still complicated, comes complete with a universal vocabulary: love. In love. Infatuation. Boyfriend. Girlfriend. Couple. Exclusivity. There are certain behaviors that emerge as part of the package, and certain expectations understandably come into play. The demise of a romantic relationship isn't pretty, but dealing with it is much simpler.  D/s adds another dimension to a relationship. How do you call it 'love'? I loved her, but it wasn't a romantic love. It was devotion. It was a certain earned respect I gave her willingly in the knowledge that she would take care of me. And she did, for a while. I belonged to her without being owned completely, admired her without having to know all that she was. No pressure, no expectations. Just safety. She wasn't perfect, but she was pretty damn close. Closer still than anyone I've ever met.  Just like a mortal, she fell. She made a mistake I'm not sure I can see past. There are certain things a dominant shouldn't ever do. Though I expected it, it was a betrayal I wasn't ready for. Not from her.  And now, I am left very much lost. When you've belonged - when you've been defended and protected and cherished the way I was, it's hard to even briefly consider the thought of being anything but. It's next to impossible to understand the way I was before... painfully free. The loyalty that's been bred into me works against me these days: my body refuses to respond to anyone but her. It even dares to disobey me.  Yes, I know it won't last forever. I'm aware I'll get over this, and move on, and eventually reestablish as MINE those parts of me that belonged to her. Right now, though... right now I don't know how to handle the need. Right now, it hurts.  Do me a favor. Next time, remind me to save emotional submission only for gods.

      Today the Hush turns into matchmakers corner for a moment:   Wanted   Qualities : Intelligent, humourous, literate, playful, urbane. Must know who Aristotle was (not the shipping magnate).   Sex : Female  Age : 25 - 40  Sexual Orientation : Submissive streak (sexually only) preferred  Details : Race, religion, politics inconsequential  Location : Somewhere near Atlanta, Georgia. US   Recommentations:  Well, after many long discussions with Dean... I'm almost positive he's not a serial killer.   I actually think he's rather nice and sane. I also think he's a pretty genuine human being; a tad romantic for my tastes BUT most women would probably really like him.  Does he have baggage? Of course he does...he's a grown-up! But less than your average male of his age considering he's going through a divorce and he doesn't like his job! He doesn't have any nasty chips on his shoulder and he's not in the least bit bitter (which is good, because bitter looks lousy on a man!).  What does he look like? I have no idea (that kind of stuff just doesn't matter to me) but I think he has a profile online somewhere with a pic.  True he isn't a registered Dom in long standing (do they have a registry - damn, the should!) but he is very, very keen on learning and I get the feeling he takes the whole thing very seriously in terms of responsibility and respect.  Look, if I wasn't in Southeast Asia, I would probably eat him up myself (and since he is a little right of center politically, that really IS saying something!)... someone nice ought to get him!

      Ok, that was another very lateral title. But what I wanted to discuss, because it has come up as a topic for so many of us, is making someone into a dominant.  Is it possible? My experience says no. If someone is just not "wired" that way, you are just going to end up ruining the vanilla relationship you have if you try to force the issue.  On the other hand... I have met a number of people who were "hidden" dominants. What I mean by this is: you might know someone a long time and never know that lurking underneath was a Dom/Domme waiting to get out. Most reasonably intelligent, egalitarian men (I don't know about other sexes - please someone write something on this) have a very hard time admitting that they have dominant feelings. They are horrified of being accused of being sexist or misogynist because they DO like women and they DO believe in equality among the sexes. For that very reason, they are badly conflicted about their desires.  And you might have one of those on your hands....  So... how to approach the subject? How do you tempt them to come out of the closet? How do you make them feel safe about acting out their wiring? Safety isn't just an issue for submissives.   Any ideas? Comments? Additions?  Actually, Urbanstud wrote such an interesting post from an "emerging Dominant's" point of view - it's really worth a read:  urlLink Transitions  (and the post before it is not half-bad either :-) )

      To me, a Dom is The Keyholder. He can allow me access, he holds the map and knows my path. And he can deny me that very same access. That is his power. He can manipulate me till I whimpering admit to being a slut and a filthy whore, crying from gratitude that he brought me there, liberated from inhibition and social conditioning.   This is going to be tongue in cheek, but here we go:  I believe, basically, that religion is created by human beings. Catholicism, Paganism, Zen, Spiritism, Christianity in all its variations, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and other vast pantheons. I get completely awed by the capacity of the human mind to create such enormous, complex metaphors of the human experience. I do not have "faith" in any of these as a direct bearer of a Truth that is not - in its essence - created by the imaginative power of the human mind. I do, however, have faith in the fact that the human potential is virtually limitless. Maybe the fulfillment gained from religion comes from the usefullness of its metaphors. It's ability to create extraordinarily strong frames of mind, through which life can be granted its meaning.  When I read all these posts on religion, I came to think of our discussion on 24/7 D/s and non-sexual submission. I think this discussion, as well as the one on sex and religion, addresses our varied and subjective paths to ecstacy. Fetishism, religious experiences, sprituality, Domestic Discipline, pain ... all can be individual and quite complex paths to that special, ecstatic mind/body space we all crave so much. And I have learned a lot about my own path from these discussions!  My experience of submission differs from some described here by the specifics of my path and by the "nature" of my ecstacy. It is located in a slightly different mental space, I think. As I have said before (can't remember if it was here or on my own blog), I am not cut out for 24/7 DD relations. And I think the discussion of religion has made it clearer to me why I am not.   A Dom does not govern me and I do not serve him. He does something, which to me is even more precious. He has the power to overrule every obstacle I (with my social/cultural conditioning) find on my path to ecstatcy. In sexual submission, I am not absolved from sin, I am liberated and pushed into The Forbidden, the dripping, roaring darkness of sexual ecstacy. I am dommed into going there without guilt. Into those parts of me which I either do not allow myself to access, or which I am unable to access by myself. And I am coerced, manipulated and forced to accept and love that "elsewhere".   To me, a Dom is The Keyholder. He can allow me access, he holds the map and knows my path. And he can deny me that very same access. That is his power. He can manipulate me till I whimpering admit to being a slut and a filthy whore, crying from gratitude that he brought me there, liberated from inhibition and social conditioning.   I cannot live within a relationship, where sin consists of not obeying rules which sounds too much like the rules of religions or fathers. Religions and fathers are the creators of obstacles on my path to ecstacy. My only sin is stopping at such an obstacle. And for that I do not want forgiveness.  A Dom is not a Father. A Dom is a killer of all Fathers. He overrules any father installed in my head, any motherly advice ever given to me. In his hands I am not freed from sin, I am liberated from any notion of "sin" whatsoever. That is his power. I am not begging for forgiveness. I am begging for allowance and the removal of obstacles on my path. He removes my responsibility for going there.   It may be a matter of semiotics only? A matter of concepts not making sense to me, not resonating within me. "Sin" is not an obstacle to me. "Forgiveness" only means that I have granted a Dom the power to define what is to be forgiven. I don't think I can do that. I think I might as well join a sect if I were to give up that type of defining power. "Guilt" isn't truly an obstacle either. If it was, I would be able to overcome that by myself. My obstacles are deeply rooted psychological inhibitions towards complete surrender to lust and ecstacy. To my Darkness. I cannot beat those alone. I need pressure, manipulation, coercion and a Dom who gets more and more aroused for every obstacle he makes me conquer.  Oh, Damn! This is so complex. I hope it makes some kind of sense anyhow. If not, please forgive me...  ;-)

       urlLink   The discussion on religion is interesting... but frankly not relevant here UNLESS you connect it specifically to the D/s experience. I glimpsed a the blog and realized that anyone coming across it and seeing it out of context would think we were a bunch of religious fanatics. And that offends me, because personally, I'm a RABID ATHEIST.   So please, I have every respect for your right to show your religious devotion - but if your post is not addressing specific ways in which D/s and religious ritual or ideology cross over, please...leave it out.  Sorry to play the bully but that's what I am! Now, if anyone can direct me to a good image of an angel sucking off Christ, I'd be very grateful. :-)  Mistress RG

      First of all, let me say I'm flattered to be asked to post here. I'm M. If you want to know more about me, just ask. That said...   I'm blown away by the posts on sex and religion thus far. It's intriguing to me to see the various ways that faith inserts itself (no pun intended) into our sex lives. The way it can wrap itself around every facet of human existence continues to shock and amaze me.  When I was twelve, I was asked to leave the Apostolic church I had been going to since birth. Always the sensitive and caring child (and being a Libran), I easily picked up on inequality in any guise and felt the need all the way down to my bones to fight for the underdog. For those of you who know nothing about the apostolic faith, it's a small community unto itself that is based in pretty extreme Christianity. Very much like being Amish with electricity. I was bothered the most by the complete lack of gender equality. Women had to sit on opposite sides of the pews, cook and clean for the men, eat last, etc.  Finally, when I was twelve, I had enough. I approached the preacher and let him have it. And I never looked back.  My mother, thank goodness, allowed me to pick my own path. Her only disclaimer was that I believe in something. A life without belief, she always said, was a life not worth living. I landed in Paganism and have been a practicing Witch ever since.  Being Pagan has allowed me to circumvent the majority of religious/sexual hang-ups I may have had, should I have come to adulthood in that church. I have no qualms about expressing myself, both sexually and otherwise. Paganism is all about love, pleasure, the pursuit of happiness and individuality. I answer to no one but myself, I live for no one other than myself.  I've found that, however, a large percentage of the Pagan population is heavily into BDSM. I believe that, because we're allowed to be so free, we're also allowing ourselves the freedom to choose to be enslaved. In looking back, I've taken the parts of my religious upbringing that disturbed me the most and taken them into myself. I've changed them, made them my own and gained a larger control over a part of my life that was out of control.   On a related note, I've heard a few stories from submissives who were scared by their first foray into subspace. Since I've been practicing meditation and Yoga for the better part of 10 years now, I found that sinking into subspace was much like slipping into a warm bath (to steal a line from P.). It was comfortable, warm and delicious. I relished feeling out of control and, yet, knew at any moment I could bring myself out of the submissive trance I was in and back into "reality."   Hopefully that gives you some view of sex and religion from an alternative point of view. I'm already looked at as a member of a bastard child religion (although I consider it more of a spirituality), why not go even further out there and admit I like to be tied up and raped? ;)

      Religion has always been a more difficult subject for me to discuss than sex. That shouldn't be a shocker.  I was raised in a non-practicing Catholic household, and taught when I was younger that I had the unique choice of deciding whether it was for me or not.   My father once told me the story of how he had joined a Seminary, planning on becoming a man of religion.  But he failed the "Bible" course.  Yes, that's right, he failed the "Bible" course.  He said the instructor told him he questioned too much.  My mother's side of the family was very much like my own in that they were lenient and open about a person making his or her own choices.  My father's side of the family, however, was fairly staunch Catholics who attended every Sunday.  If you did not go to church and worship Him, then you were going to Hell.  I can remember in my early teens being forced to go to church with my Grandmother from my father's side.  I remember hating every moment.  They stood up, they sang.  They sat down, they sang.  They stood up, they prayed.  They sat down, they prayed.  It was like a scripted little mass-acting school, and I'd not even been given the first draft.  It was one of the only times I can actually remember being fully horrified and feeling terrible about my lack of knowledge in that area.  Still, I considered myself Catholic for quite a while, until I was in my very early twenties.  It was The Thing To Do.  One of the only reasons I stayed that way was for acceptance by my friends.  I saw a lot of hypocritical Christians; sinners in my eyes who did bad things all week and went to church on Sunday to be absolved of all of them.  It bothered me more than I ever let on, and I absolutely hated it.  When I was married, my mother-in-law introduced me to a book on Wicca.  She was dabbling and dipping into it herself.  The whole concept behind the religion intrigued me so much that I went to the local library and read nearly all the books they had on the subject.  When I was done with all of those books, I went out and bought some more for myself.  Of course, that made my -very- Baptist and controlling then-husband extremely angry with me.  Just before we separated, he nearly dragged me to church to get saved.  I left him before that could happen, though.  Wicca has been in my life since that time -- nearly four years.  I am still learning about it, trying to figure out my feelings.  I like the way it feels right in my gut, though, and I like the way it eases my mind at times.  I've always believed Nature has had a lot more to do with the flow of things than most people.  I've always thought that there is a little bit of magic in everyday things and inside of people.  I imagine if you're still with me, you're considering me some sort of flake.  That's okay.  ;)  Which brings me, finally (and probably thankfully), to the thought of religion directly relating to M/s.  I see Wicca as an extremely personal religion, and the connection between all living things as strong.  What better way to share such a connection than the trust and devotion required in giving your will to someone else?  Sex is more of a celebrated and magical thing to me than anything else.  The energies shared between two people during even the act is amazing.  When Sir was flogging me, the exchange then was doubly strong ... extremely powerful and it left me in total awe.  I didn't link the two as much then as I do now, but it was still something amazing and lovely.  My views on all religions are still shaky.  Especially after Sir died.  I can appreciate and admire those who have a solid ground of faith to stand on, though.  And I can see where someone's faith can take a deep root in the connection between Master and sub.  There.  I'm never writing another babbling, scary post on religion again.  And, as a side note, I hesitated in posting this at all.  But I decided to in the end.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing for the readers of this blog, or a bad thing.  :)

      " Lord, Jesus Christ, I approach your banquet table in fear and trembling... I am defiled by many sins in body and soul... I seek your protection, I look for your healing. I cannot bear your judgment, but I trust in your salvation. Lord, I show my wounds to you and uncover my shame before you... May [your body and blood] incite me to do the works pleasing to you and profitable to my health in body and soul."    God is the Cosmic Dom who lays down rules. We obey God because  we need him.  We are born naturally sorrowful, and it is only by his word and his grace that we find personal fulfillment. He is infallible. It is only in his perfection that we can trust. He knows what is good for us. We obey because  it is only right . God knows us intimately and loves us unconditionally; he protects us because we are his and he takes care of those that are his. The least we can do is serve him in return. However, we are never FORCED to obey him-- we obey because  we love him , and love is service. We have all the free will in the world to tell him to fuck off, but we don't because in our devotion, we believe he is worth this all. He who forces us the least has the most claim on us.   This has always sounded an awful lot like D/s to me. Both stories tell of a much-awaited escape from earthly pleasures and into a place of sheer bliss. They both involve a sinner/submissive and a forgiver/Dominant, who aside from having created us also guides us PERFECTLY so that we might find ourselves. This god works in mysterious ways, often causing us pain and sorrow precisely to be free of both. ( "You ask us to express our thanks by self-denial. We are to master our sinfulness and conquer our pride." "You give us strength to purify our hearts, to control our desires, and so to serve you in freedom.")  We are made comfortable by being drawn a box and being promised that as long as we fall within that box, we are completely and utterly free. We are taught to question (three ways by which we can know god: light of reason, light of faith, and divine revelation), but to also accept that reason is limited and faith takes over where it ends. In the end, we believe because it is who we are. We cannot fight against our nature.  Neither D/s nor Catholicism ever tries to hide the fact that it is a two-way relationship. The Dom/God gives: he grapples with much of real life and sin so that we do not have to, and provides safety and protection. He takes care of us and helps us to do what is good for us. In return, we, the submissives/believers, give him our whole hearts, minds, souls, and bodies to do with as he wishes. We give him loving service, total submission, and an unbelievably unshakable loyalty.

      I wanted to say that this relationship I have with The One (the One i serve, not the One Big Scary-Guy God that seems to pervade human existence) is very religious. And I feel quite fortunate to have had what i feel are many religious experiences in my life.   My mother is very spiritual and had been a student of Zen for years and years before i was even born, so i was always around that calm, secure persence of one who knows she's not alone. Even when she's physically very alone. I went to a very wonderful Catholic school, after a wonderful Montasorri experience, and then began a very amazing trip with psychedelics, guided by grounded individuals who were using mind drugs to expand their minds, not just to get high and weird. I spent years in the Episcopal (Anglican) church trying to be the "straight guy" for my husband and kids and had a confrontation with the Universe every time i let go of the notions that it was all a jive put on and let God--whatever-- into my head.  So that said, i've not been separated from God for long, and this isn't a substiution for IT in my life... but its definately part of IT. This other person who does EXACTLY what i NEED, right when i need it the most....instinctively, gladly, willingly, I hesitate to say its a "Gift from God" because that's separating it from IT and it can't be separated, its whole and perfect. I just know that we ALL have the same experiences, humanity is too bound up, we are too close for us to be separated and to expect that we'd all be different. I mean, I know we ARE different, different colors, different shapes and wants and experiences, but that core bit of us, that part that belongs to God, IT, the Universe, that part that goes back to IT when we die, and came from IT in the beginning, that part of us is all the same. I have grief, you have grief, I have elation and happiness, you have it, even stimulated by different things, we are all the same, and that's a head trip all by itself.  There's so much more, but it will have to wait, and that's very frustrating to me. xox

      Having touched briefly on the concept of ego deconstruction; whether it is violent or gentle, right or wrong, a sick urge or a perfectly natural thing.    And, after a quick conversation with Amazonia, who has studied Zen for a long time.   And after a particulary interesting piece of writing someone submitted on my writer's listserve.  I want to bring up the subject of religion - not specifically one, but the idea that religious devotion, regardless of religion, is very, very similar to submission.  Buddhism really deals with the idea of submission on a very exsitential level. You are nothing in the vast expanse of the universe, and the more you realize that, the closer you'll get to enlightenment. Furthermore, freeing yourself of selfish desires earns you good karma in this lifetime, and decreases the number of times you need to be reborn.  Judaism is very "Law" centered. Theologically, a practicing Jew voluntarily submits to being bound to the laws of the Torah (old testament) and the Talmud (A compendium of religious and secular laws of behavior extrapolated from the old testament). The laws cover every facet of life, from eating to menstruation. They are sometimes time-based and always involve some ritual. In fact, the laws regarding ritual purity - immersion - are very much like the making an act of contrition in the Catholic faith. The ritual cleanses you of spiritual impurity.  Catholisism not only touches on the idea of submitting yourself to the will of a greater power (all Christian sects do that), but specifically, the act of communion, penance, contrition and confession are all akin to very intense parts of a D/s relationship.  Furthermore, the belief that pain is somehow "cleansing" is particularily practiced by Southern Mediterranean Catholics. I refer here to the Easter processionals with their habits of dripping hot wax onto their skin, or flogging themselves publicly as a way to purge themselves of sin.  Certainly, a number of Protestant sects baptize at the age of maturity, suggesting that being "washed in the Blood of the Lamb" is a ritual for purging guilt; washing away sin.  Sadly, I know pitifully little about Islamic or Sharia law. If anyone who reads this and knows more is interested in posting, please email me and I will add you to the team members. I'm extremely interested to acquire Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, etc. members.  So...what has all this got to do with being a submissive? Well, I will offer you a theory - mine and mine alone. (I certainly am not suggesting that anyone else feels this way).  The act of submission in the context of D/s purges you of guilt, of denial, and, to a certain extent, of responsibility. For me at least, there is something accutely redemptive about submission.  Finally, if you are religious and offended by this post, remember that my views don't represent the views of everyone who participates on this blog, AND you are more than welcome to air your own views on the subject.  rg

      Hello.  I'm Maculate Deviant (or MD or Devi, depending on who you talk to).  And RG has been nice enough to let me post over here with all of the other subbies.  ;)  Sure, I have enough room on my own blog to put up plenty of posts.  So why over here?  Because I want to keep my submissive blathering away from my p0rn, and because this blog seems to get more discussion than anything I've ever posted over on my own blog.  So.  Here I am.  I've only been in one true M/s relationship.  But it was lovely, and it made me feel whole for the first time in my life.  I can't ever remember that feeling from any other relationship I've had.  Sir was the one who let me know I was sub, and showed me how it could help me in my own life.  And he did it with caring and intelligence ... and lots of nice blows with the flogger.  ;)  To make a very long story short, Sir committed suicide in May.  The whole experience has left me lonely, doubting, and guilty at times.  And quite empty.  I've been talking to a lot of Doms lately (and a few submissives), trying to find out if I really am a sub.  Most of them have no doubt that I'm sub.  I think I'll have doubts until I find another Dom and see if I like it.  But finding a Dom is proving to be daunting.  Everyone has a different opinion of what M/s should be, and finding someone with the same opinion is pretty hard.  I'm finding that a lot of 'Doms' seem to think a sub should automatically lick their feet at the first meeting.  How they've come to that conclusion is beyond me, but they have.  And I'm just not wired that way.  This post is all over the place.  Hope it made sense. 'Hi' to all of you other lovely folks out there!

      I wrote a line of dialogue in  urlLink The Waiting Room , and  urlLink Yen  commented on it. It got me thinking about how and why I wrote it. It was very, very hard for me to write but it was one of those lines that the character just  had  to say:   "I'm going to make you... into something new," He panted at her ear, "Oh, something... very beautiful."    Yen's comment was:   "Make you into something new"?? I'm surprised at you! That sounds like something that you'd get your feathers very ruffled about! I'd rather not be made into something new, thank you very much.   You see, Yen actually knows me pretty well because it DID bother me to write it, kicked and kicked and then I typed it.   I've had emails back and forth with  urlLink Rose  where we've talked very seriously about the deconstruction of the ego and really, when you ask someone to do that for you, aren't you asking them to make you into something new? And what kind of sick puppy wants their ego deconstructed anyway? Well, this sick little puppy does.  I don't think all submissives have dark souls that yearn for redemption; I don't think they are all broken and need to be "made into something new." But to pretend that I am a completely mentally healthy individual, or that my need for submission doesn't stem, in part, from the darker, more chaotic side of my nature, that for me, this pursuit is a totally natural and that I'm a born-submissive, that would be a big fucking lie.   Do I think that submission is some kind of a psychological cure for sick little puppies like me? No, not at all. It just gives me some temporary relief from the existential angst.  rg

      First of all ... sweet bajayzus!  I hope I'm doing this right, Yen.  :)  Second of all ... I have just been neatly Dommed online.   I never did quite catch the 'online Domming' thing.  Nor the 'Domming over the phone' thing.  Both seemed like a potentially dangerous thing to do with my submissiveness.  However, when you crave being submissive (to someone you trust) like a crack fiend craves the next hit, then you'll [read: I'll] take what you can get.  He's from Canada, and he's become my friend first.  He hasn't been pushy at all.  In fact, I sometimes think that he likes me more from my intelligence than for anything else.  That, and my wonderful sense of sarcasm.  But, I was tipsy tonight (damn Kahlua is the DEVIL), and feeling extraordinarily subby, and he just sort of swung into that mode.  It was very odd to see him do that.  But since I trust him quite a bit, and know he's being very careful with me (even in our completely vanilla conversations, I can tell he is), then it was shockingly easy for me to slip into sub mode and let him Dom me like that.   Very  shocking.  I would be lying if I said that it didn't satisfy that little craving I have.  It was more like a sort of an exchange between good friends, and I liked the vibe I got from the whole thing.  However, being Dommed online like that leaves much to be desired ... on both ends.  On my end, I don't get the touch and the pain administered by someone ELSE.  On his end, he really can't see how I'm reacting and probably has trouble judging how things work when he's doing them (which is why he's careful.)  Plus, there's no nuzzling and cuddly hugs after, and no touch to make things better.  It leaves me wanting and very puzzled sometimes.  I'm unsure if I want to do either the phone thing or the online thing again.  We'll see.  In other news, I've been asked to consider going to visit another Dom friend of mine who lives up north (not Canada :) .)  I've known him for about two months all told, and he's very sweet and seems to like me a lot, which is what I look for first.  He's also offered to pay for the ticket.  He's insisting I have a friend of mine run his name in through security, he's insisting I have someone to call at certain times while I'm up there to let them know I'm okay, and he's insisting that we have generally established rules and a safeword.  All of said insisting makes me feel better about the whole thing, but going to meet someone you've never met before is still a scary thing.  Scary, but I -still- think I want to do it.  He told me to take as much time as I wanted to think about it, which I'm going to do.  I really do think he's a pretty great guy, and maybe going up there will actually help me.  Who knows?  That's it for the randomness of this post.  What do you guys think?

      Sometimes, in stories, I use the word "whore". I recently received a comment that really shocked me but reminded me that words have unbelievable power - to be used creatively or derisively...     This was the comment:    Not so sure about "make you my whore."  In my experience, service providers are very much in control -- at some level, at lesat. Sophie might not know that, but Gunter surely must. Then perhaps he knows that Sophie does not know... And so on.    I was dumbstruck. It took me a while to figure out what he meant. I realized he was talking about sex workers... You see, I would never dream of referring to a sex worker as a 'whore'.  Words like "slut", "whore", etc.  All of them refer to women who enjoy sex in a society which has, for hundreds of years, branded those women as sinful, evil, immoral.  So, when I use them now... it is with the power to repossess those words. Like "queer", these are words that need to be taken back by women and worn as a badge of honour.  And when I take them back, and I confer the meaning I want them to have - they are erotic as hell.  Ironically, after reading the post, I went and looked up the dictionary definition of the word.  1.A prostitute.  2.A person considered sexually promiscuous.  3.A person considered as having compromised principles for personal gain.   But what I liked best was the linguisting origins:     Word History:  Derivatives of Indo-European roots have often acquired starkly contrasting meanings. A prime example is the case of the root *ka, “to like, desire.” From it was derived a stem *karo-, from which came the prehistoric Common Germanic word *horaz with the underlying meaning “one who desires” and the effective meaning “adulterer.” The feminine of this, *horon-, became hore in Old English, the ancestor of Modern English whore. In another branch of the Indo-European family, the same stem *karo- produced the Latin word carus, “dear.” This word has several derivatives borrowed into English, including caress, cherish, and charity, in Christian doctrine the highest form of love and the greatest of the theological virtues. ·Another derivative of the root *ka- in Indo-European was *kamo-, a descendant of which is the Sanskrit word for “love,” kma, appearing in the name of the most famous treatise on love and lovemaking, the Kamasutra.   Some words have layered and deeply erotic meanings for me; "whore" is definitely one of them.  Oh, and just to clarify:  Prostitution is a profession. Being a whore is a calling.  rg

      Prompted by a number of comments on TWR, I got to thinking about what makes a good Dominant. A lot of submissives like the fictional Doms I write but, ironically, many Doms don't. This got me thinking about what subs need vs. what Doms think they need...   Honestly, I can only speak for myself. So, in no particular order of preference, here's my list of the character traits that make a good Dom - real or fictional.  1. A sense of humour. 2. A sense of humanity. 3. An ability to control themselves - not always, but most of the time. 5. An ability to control me. 6. An analytical nature. 7. Excellent communication skills. 8. An ability to show emotion (and a reticence to act on it). 9. A fairly high sex drive. 10. A creative thinker. 11. A willingness to show sexual excitement. 12. An ability to distinguish between me as a sub and me as a person.  Ok. Now I get to have a little fun with this.  What some "Dom's" think are important:  1.  Their name  - i.e. Master Thunderdick. Firstly, most of them just make be giggle. Secondly, if you are a Dom, you're a Dom. You don't need a title unless you think it magically confers a little extra power on you. I am NEVER going to call a stranger Master or Sir or any other honorific unless I have a relationship with them and the relative roles have been agreed upon. I will not give people respect simply because they've decided to call themselves Master. I give everyone the same amount of respect until I feel they are owed more from me - and that is a very personal thing.  2.  The size of their dick.  Frankly - it it's small, there are always dildos. If it's more than 7 inches - get the fuck away from me! That is the one way I don't like to be hurt.  3.  An imposing, patronizing manner of speaking  I'm submissive, not subnormal!  4.  Using words like "lifestyle":  i.e.  I've been in the LIFESTYLE for  ( insert an improbable number here )  years . Fuck I hate that word - it means NOTHING. Everyone has a different definition of what it is anyway. To be honest, I'm just interested in a nice man with a Dominant personality - especially sexually. All that telling me you have been in the "lifestyle" for 20 years means to me is that you have an enormous tolerance for boredom.  So.... what are you looking for in a Dom?

      At the request of RG, who got the idea from Rose, I've fiddled with the template and learned enough XHTML from the Blogger help pages to figure out how to integrate that tiny little Read more! link at bottom into every post.   If you're reading this, it works! There's a problem, though... this method involves a change in the template of the blog AND (unless the Hush team is willing to learn how to use a simple tag) one in the posting template, even the older entries are affected. They all have a little link at the end, even though it's pretty useless-- this method requires a manual summary/excerpt of every post.  urlLink This one  is an alternative. It shows/hides the entire post, without the benefit of a summary, but it does it to all posts automatically. It uses plain old CSS (as opposed to this one's conditional CSS) and javascript. Let me know what you think. Oh, and also, let me know if you can't figure out how to work the new posting template.

      Devi's post made me really think... about definitions. I've had the very same experience she has had and I must admit - it didn't have the same effect. I didn't doubt my "submissiveness" for a moment - but I sure doubted their legitimacy. I know what turns me on and makes me tick. I've lived in this body and this mind for a while and I don't tolerate some stranger telling me what I am.  I think this is a real problem with online relationships. You don't get to look into that person's eyes and they don't get to look into yours. You don't get to see each other's humanity. You can't read them or their desires - and they can't read yours. They can't see your body respond to pain or a word, and you can't see their reaction to imposing it.   I'm not saying that an online relationship can't work. I'm simply saying that you have to be really lucky to find one that will.  And, if you ever have doubts about who you are, remember. A Dom/Domme has a lot of responsibilities. But identifying you as submissive is not one of them. That you have to do for yourself.   The other thing worth remembering is that a selfish, self-centered, egotistical bastard/bitch is not a Dominant - he/she is just a selfish, self-centered, egotistical bastard/bitch. Dominants are generosity incarnate. They give you what you need - not what they want. If that happens to be what they want too - then you've got a relationship on your hands!

      I've had a weird past few days. Or, weeks, rather.  By putting my profile up on one of those BDSM sites, I've been talking to a lot of Doms online.  And people who -think- they're Doms.   I've been told several times that I'm not a 'true sub' in the past few weeks.  I've already had doubts about that myself.  I must admit, though, that the people who've said this about me -- well, they wouldn't be the first sort of people that I'd invite to a picnic.  I've also met lots of lovely, wonderful people ... whom I've alienated or basically made feel like shit.  ;)  I throw up major walls if people start poking past them.  If they manage to get a little through them, then I call in reinforcements and sandbags.  This tends to either make people think I'm a bitch, or make people think that I'm not worth talking to.  Which, in some cases and on some days, I'm not.  But ... I -need- a Dom.  That's the only thing that seems to work for me.  That wonderful mindfuck, that wiggles through the cracks in my walls and and exposes me for my inner slut.  The deep, hard, wondrous pain that centers me and opens me up in so many ways.  Deep in subspace, willing and eager to please, wonderful place that it is.  And having someone there to prop me up after I come out of it, nicely reconstructed and formed.  I really need that.  I just reject it at every turn.  ;)  Maybe that's why I can associate so much with RG's stories.  It's almost like she's crawled inside of my head or something.  Scary.  Anyway, that's my thinking out loud today.  Well, not really out loud, except for the sound of my keyboard.

      "Paths to ecstasy" is an excellent topic concept.  I used to think that I'd get there by being the perfect wife and mother, living this culturally- approved life.   Now i'm not so sure i'll ever reach that place we've been told about because i'm pretty sure that myth is not applicable to my life. ( I hate all that PC jive where we then say, but it might happen for others. But it *might*.) I'm living ecstasy now. I'm not waiting for nirvana or enlightenment any more.  I don't know if there's a heaven per se. I'm curious tho. But I do know i reach heaven nearly every time He puts his big strong hands into my back and pushes into me. Maybe He's pushing me into heaven with each thrust.  I never thought i'd EVER EVER EVER be this happy. Ecstasy is the byproduct of what we are doing; what we are for each other.  I realized several years ago that this man and i had something that could NEVER be wrong, no matter how "sinful" it appeared, no matter how many people were offended by us. We both left a wake of people in our rush to each other. A husband, a boyfriend (long story, i'm a predator, sorry)  girlfriends, whole lives in separate towns. We were told the wreckage was so wrong, and we didn't mean to, but couldn't help it.   Nothing in my life prepared me for crashing into this other half of my sky. Nothing i ever did or read or hoped for could have prepared me.  so what is curious to me is... what makes you all so very happy, what is your ectasy trip? sexually is fine, but if sushi does it for you, or sewing Renaissance era costumes is your bag, that's what i want to know about too.

      Damn, that's one fast response, RG :-) I had a feeling I had forgotten something in my post, and you nailed it immediately. You're sharp as a razor, girl!  I guess my point is ... semiotic?  What I mean is that the traditional concepts of sin and forgiveness doesn't strike any conscious chords within me. They have no meaning to me.  Neither does the entire Christian structure of sin, redemption, forgiveness, absolution, etc., etc. It is a system which makes perfect sense if you have faith. That I have been brought up in a society in which morality and social restrictions to a large degree stems from a Christian tradition doesn't change that fact. That is - to me - merely historical residue. As a Dane, I also suffer from vague subconscious images of Viking strength - which doesn't mean that that I dive into a mythic Nordic mindframe every time I have to understand why I'm such an arrogant bitch.   The discourse within which I live effects me on so many levels. So, naturally, some of the inhibitions which I long to conquer stems from ideas developed through thousands of years, the majority of which were soaked in religious Mumbo Jumbo. The system in which these limits or inhibitions were generated and within which they made/make sense is not mine. And in society as a whole, that system has been transformed, it has morphed from religious beliefs based on faith and devotion into the basic moral fabric of Western life.   My inhibitions (or whatever they should be named) could, if seen through a purely religious perspective, be regarded as an awareness of sin. That perspective isn't mine, though. I feel these inhibitions as the result of a moral matrix imposed on me through life and nurture. I am oblivious and indifferent as to where they came from. Well, it is interesting from an academic perspective, but so far, there's no key to my sexual mind buried in religious texts. And I've read a few!  The Christian doctrine does not offer me relief. It holds no path to ecstacy. I do not regard my inhibitions as awareness (however subliminal) of sin, so forgiveness holds no attraction for me. My inhibitions aren't connected to a Master, a God, an "IT". They are my own, buried deep within me, and I'm sure Lord Jesus would prefer them in place. The path I'm trying to clear with the help of a Dom doesn't lead to a type of salvation accepted by any Christian doctrine that I know of.  If the obstacles in my path to ecstacy stems from Christianity (and God), what a Dom can do is not forgive me for my sins, but become an exhorcist freeing me from the historical residue of a religion I have never believed in.

      You have taken an extremely complex subject and the dichotomies associated with it and done a very good job of measuring its dimensions.    However, I wanted to challenge you on something you said after you rejected the concept of sin:  "My obstacles are deeply rooted psychological inhibitions towards complete surrender to lust and ecstacy."  The origins of sex guilt in Christian traditions date back to the council of Nicea. Traditionally there is a belief that animals are base and humans are not. Why? Because humans have souls. So anything base or earthy or animalistic is "ungodly" in its essence. The true path of every human should be to aspire to elevate themselves above the natural, sensual world and thus attain proximity to god. Certainly one of the reasons why St. Francis of Assisi was considered so contraversial in his time was that he challenged that view.   Of course, now, Christian doctrine has reversed itself on this in the last 100 years. Nature is part of god, sex is a beautiful gift from god, etc. But this is a VERY RECENT doctrinal change. But remember that less than 50 years ago, good christians were expected, even when married in the eyes of god, to participate in sexual intercourse ONLY for the purpose of procreation. Recreational sex was considered animalistic, sensual and a distraction from your journey towards elevation to the spiritual plane.  I would argue that, whether you are a believer or not, your deeply rooted inhibitions stem from the pervasive and parasitic underlying belief in the baseness of the natural world, originating from the Christian doctrine that has permeated Western culture for 2000 years.   So, whether you believe in the concept of "sin" or not, you are still reacting to it - legitimizing the concept in a way - by rejecting it. Oh, and by the way...I feel exactly the same way... :-) It's like vogue models - I KNOW they're ridiculous, but every so often, in a moment of weakness, I want to look like one.

      Writing this was extremely cathartic for me.  If you don't want to put this up, thats fine... I know its kinda gross... but I wanted to share it with you, because I am deeply grateful to you for inspiring me to sit down and sort through this.  Thank you.  angel  My parents were on the verge of divorce when my mother discovered she was pregnant with me. The pregnancy was considered high risk, and the decision was all but made to terminate it.  However, an ultrasound was ordered, and in the long gone days of 1976, technology was not what it is today.  The cord was mistaken for male genitals and a celebration ensued. Here was the little boy they had prayed for, sent to save their marriage.  And, then, my mother gave birth to me.  Shock. Horror.  Outrage.  I had tricked them into allowing my existence.  I was shuffled off to live with my father's parents while they decided what the hell to do about me.  I have no doubt this process may have gone on forever, with them only seeing me when my grandmother had to go to the hospital or some such, but when I was eight something happened which forced them to bring me home. You see, my grandfather was a sadistic pedophile who had already had both of my sisters, in addition to every other female member of my father's family.  My older sister, married, with a young daughter of her own, threw the legacy of silence to the winds and blew the whistle on him.  The end result is my sisters and I are family pariahs but I was brought home.   My mother came to see that she loved me.  That she had been horribly wrong in treating her child that way.   When she saw the scars on me, and heard the results of countless tests, she was heartbroken, and vowed to make it up to me.  We achieved a very close and loving relationship, which we enjoyed until her death.   My father did not see things that way.  Now, not only had I tricked him into allowing my existence; I had destroyed his family, and brought shame to his father.  In short, he hated me.  He has never missed a chance to let me know that he hates me; despite the fact I spent countless time and energy trying to make him love me.  From 8 to 14, I was obsessed with my father's illusive affection. I thought if I were the top student he would love me, if I were the hardest worker, the prettiest, the most popular.  I tried everything; he remains aloof to this day.  Now, that we have finally gotten through all this back-story I can make my point.  I have always felt I have something for which I need to atone. I feel that I must be in everyone's bad graces all the time, and that I must struggle to make them see that I am not so bad.  After all, my very existence was so horrible I was banished to abuse.  My grandfather was skilled atusing these ideas against me, until I truly believed that I had earned the horrible things he did to me, by being less than what my parents wanted.   Lots of therapy later, I know that I have every right to be myself without having to please.  The thing is, when myself was developing, I held these values, and somewherealong the line, the need to be a pleasure was deeply ingrained in my personality.  It is endlessly complicated.  i have a lot more to say, but this is turning into a book,so I am going to leave this here, and maybe pick it up on my own journal - I suppose the point I wanted to make is that, in my formative years, I struggled to gain the love and approval of two men, my father and my grandfather.  One was only appeased by pain, suffering and sorrow.  The other could not be appeased.  And, yes, I believe this has a lot to do with who I am today.

      Once you've been rejected by a parent, you never recover. I don't care what anybody else says, I know this in my heart. All the shrinks who want to talk&nbsp; you down and convince you otherwise, are probably from loving homes or experimenting on you.   My heart belonged to him until he threw it to the ground and walked away. He is the very worst kind of alcoholic and drug addict. Yes, there are scales of wretchedness and he's off the deep end. That he still lives shocks me almost daily. I've spoken to him 3 times in 16 years. He's never seen my children, they ask questions about him, which I try not to lie in addressing.   I first considered posting about his life and predelictions, but after ruminating on it for a full day, i think just my reaction to it all is what really matters. And all those hours of therapy made me sure that its all about me at this point, not him.   He rejected me. He played head games with me when he wasn't rejecting me. He refused to help support us financially.&nbsp; &nbsp;He scared me and confused me and told me CRAZY things. He took me and my brother into extreemly dangerous situations, he left us places for long periods of time while he did whatever he wanted to. He brought a series of women (and men) into our lives, people who meant nothing to him, but whom we grew close to, only to be punished for our falling in love with more nurtuting people.   So where did this leave me? My best girlfriend and I founded the "Bad Daddy Club" in college and its got many charter members. I steeled myself, did that promiscuious/ drug /punk band thing that RG mentioned, found a man I thought would keep me safe and be that daddy for me (at least he's a marginally good daddy to our kids), went into therapy (alot) and then got to where I could parent my own self. (at least when I'm strong and emotionally healthy.) Did I mention prozac? And several&nbsp; hospital stays? And suicide attempts? Not in that order.   I'm almost 40 god damn years old. I try to grow up every day. But I still want/need Jon to be the father to my little girl. This sounds so desperate and sad. And my childhood wasn't really, at least not on the surface, but its all that foetid caudron stuff that RG talks about that over shadows the beautiful childhood images.   I drank too much last&nbsp; night,&nbsp; but I never worry that I'm an alcoholic...i knew what i was doing and it was just what i needed, only now i need a glass of water and a pain pill. My head's splitting, but that may be what's become known as "the Bad Daddy Club" headache, one seems to develope it from all the wincing and squirrming one does when divulging&nbsp; one's membership the first time.

      I started to respond to a couple of comments on my latest chapter of The Waiting Room. I was going to justify why I wrote something; no one was asking me to and yet I felt compelled to do it...    For the majority of you who don't want to bother reading it, I'll make a precis of it: I set a particularity emotionless fuck-scene in the toilet of a Laotian train. (Think holes in the floor, hot, unbelievably unhygienic and overwhelming stench)   The thing is -- I had to write it -- because I had to talk about where you go when you realize that something that disgusts you intensely also turns you on. The example I use in the story is an incredibly mild one and, I'm not going to go through a list of them, because it's different for each person.   And maybe healthy people don't have this problem at all.   But I'm like a Russian Doll -- lots of layers. When I first had to admit the obvious to myself, that I was quite sexually submissive, I was intellectually disgusted. I've found my way past it now, I have found a way to live with and look at that part of me without flinching.   However, there are several MUCH darker areas that, quite frankly, I just can't bring myself to even type. Let's just say that they involve blood, some violence, and a significant amount of trespassing on trust. (Yeah, sorry...just can't say it). And for any of you who have seen the movie " urlLink Crash ", or read the book, that is the vanilla-vanilla version with the cars as extraneous members of the cast.   They are "nameless" fetishes to me. Fantasies that I probe with the tip of my mental index finger from time to time. It's intensely erotic for me when I do and it always makes me sick, sometimes for days, afterwards.   I'm torn between the desire to "  tell the truth and shame the devil  " and a Victorian belief that some things should probably be locked in the closet where they belong and remain unnamed, unspoken.   But two things puzzle me about them: Why is my response sexual? And, where the hell did they come from? Those two questions send me back to the closet for another peek, again and again. But once there, I'm so blinded by the eroticism, I can't concentrate on attempting to answer the questions that took me there in the first place. Does that make any sense at all?   Do you have them? If so, how big is your closet?

      Amazonia brought up the subject of fathers and the damage their absence or disdain can do to a daughter's self-image. Does this play a part in drawing us into a cyclical greek tragedy wherein each new sexual partner is required to punish and praise us like a benevolent patriarch?  And is each rejection the re-enactment of that first and most painful of rebuffs?    I have my disagreements with Dr. Freud but, where he addressed issues of how parental relationships help mould sexual development, the old boy said some interesting things. Also, blaming your parents for all your woes is fine when your 16, but it wears a little thin by the time you hit 30. So, threadbare though this post might be, I'm going to indulge, because I do think it partially addresses the wounds that some women who are submissive seek to heal, over and over.    A Portrait of My Father   My father was the product of his own horrific childhood. He was sent to "Canterbury School for Boys" at the age of 6 where he was beaten, raped and tortured by "prefects", as a "fag", in the time-honoured tradition of all good English public schools (yes, that is the origin of the word "fag" as it is used today). On school holidays, he had no respite. One summer, during the war, his family retreated from the bombing of London to an hotel in Torquay - a smug, quiet seaside resort in the South of England. It was there that his father hung him off the balcony by his ankles and threatened to drop him unless his wife coughed up enough money to enable him to buy his way into the Foreign Legion. (Incidentally, he got the money, joined up, and then had to be bought out, at a later date, suffering from hepatitis and ennui.)   On reaching the age of majority, my father found that a vast sum of money, left to him in trust by his grandfather, had been embezzled. By his own mother and his recently-acquired step father.   My father became a writer, a playwright, and a journalist and married a woman who resembled his own mother as little as possible. Sexually, my mother confided in me that he was inhibited and constantly guilt-ridden. She surmised that, given the opportunity, my father would have taken gladly to the cruel whip hand of some disdainful and severe mistress with the deep-seated relief of a duck slipping into a pond. To her knowledge, he never indulged. More's the pity; he probably would have been a far better father had he done so.   That is not to say that he wasn't, until I hit puberty, a good father; he was a fabulous dad until then.    My Relationship with Him     I suffered badly and chronically from the croup as a child. My father would often come into my room with five furry hand puppets and perform the whole of Dylan Thomas' "Under Milkwood" for me. He would hunker down with me, under a towel, and patiently coax deep breaths of the mentholated steam by making up hysterical limericks -- I'd belly laugh and pull the steam down into the bottom of my lungs. He once took me on a hike up a mountain near El Escorial, in Spain. When we got to the summit, he created a little stupa of stones, one laid neatly on top of the other. Then, he took out a couple of scraps of paper and a pen and we sat, composing messages of great importance and depth to leave sandwiched between the rocks for the next explorer who happened by. Land-locked messages in bottles, if you will. If I have any creativity in my soul, I owe the majority of it to my father.   Then, I became pubescent. A shadow the size of the Jupiter eclipsed my father's affection for me. I use the word 'eclipsed' because it was exactly like that; it happened by degrees, imperceptibly, over time. One day, it suddenly occurred to me that he just didn't love me any more.   He hadn't withdrawn or become aloof; he became, in fact, altogether too present. He was critical and cruel in those ways only extremely intelligent men can be. He didn't say I was ugly – he simply hinted at ways in which I might improve my looks. He didn't call me stupid but, following some comment I made at the dinner table, would don the sad and weary expression of someone very disappointed in the lack of intelligence so clearly and painfully obvious to him. He had this wan smile that could slice off my face and drop it onto the plate in front of me like a samurai sword – clean, surgical and complete.   From 13 to 16, I fought valiantly to win back his affection. I left carefully typed poems of deep existential angst on his bedside table. At first, he didn't mention them at all. Later, when I begged for a reaction, he'd say: "Well, dear, I'm sorry to have to say this but they're really bad…they're utter crap. You  do  want to hear the truth, don't you? You wouldn't want me to lie and say they were good, just to make you feel better."   One Sunday morning, at the age of 16, our small family gathered around the dinning room table, eating brunch and reading various parts of the Sunday papers - this was a fixed and time-honoured ritual. I suddenly announced that, having reached the age of permission, I was going to do the responsible and mature thing and go on the Pill.   My father glanced up from his  Times Literary Supplement  and said, "You fucking slut!"  My mother (until then a physically comforting if somewhat unbalanced influence on my life), stood up quietly, walked around the table, made a fist and hit him so hard that his chair tipped backwards, smashing his head against the wall. Without stopping to notice whether he was fully conscious or not, she stood over him and muttered: "If I ever hear you refer to our daughter that way again, I'll slit your fucking throat with a kitchen knife."   A little pause here is necessary to underscore that this was the  only  incidence of physical violence I ever witnessed in my family life. I would also like to explain that both my father and mother were routinely and shockingly foul-mouthed; the first coherent word to slip across my younger brother's infant lips was "shit!"   That incident convinced me that no amount of cleverness, prettiness or devotion on my part was likely to win back my father's affection. As a presence or an influence on my life, he simply ceased to exist. Within six months, having finished school rather early, I moved out and proceeded to do what all good teenagers do: I fucked a lot, did a ton of drugs, and joined a very loud, very offensive band.    Latency    Quite a few years later, I had, by necessity, a very short fling with a fellow musician. In the midst of a particularly energetic fuck, my partner looked down at me, smoothed my face with his hand and said, "Good girl…"   For those of you who haven't been terribly promiscuous yet, I should warn you: bursting into tears in the middle of what, for all intents, is a one-night-stand is in very, very poor taste. It's simply not done! Especially during an overwhelming orgasm that comes hard on the heels of hearing those words (yes, I noticed the pun – no it wasn't intentional).   Oh, what a sick little remittance girl I am!

      (quoted:  Pris , from  Bladerunner ) At the tail end of messing up, I found out something rather interesting about myself. I found out exactly why, psychologically, I am submissive...   I've always had a war with it, you know. I have such a spiky, sharp-edged sense of my own dignity. It either cuts people I have no wish to harm or, when taken forcefully from me, drags me down to that dark place kicking and screaming...just before I shatter, fragment and explode in orgasm.  Well, it's probably an afternoon's entertainment for someone, but really, what a production!  Did I mention before that I always thought that my submissiveness came from a particularity unhealthy place? Probably.  But today, I found out something rather interesting. I have a horror of imposing myself physically or romantically on others. That is actually something of an understatement. The moment I fear that I might have outstayed my welcome, either in someone's bed OR in someone's heart, I need to get out that door so fast that neither a herd of elephants nor an 8 inch brick wall could possibly stop me.  Because the idea that I might have imposed for longer feels a lot like I'm committing rape, or incest, or some incredibly heinous act of another sort. My terror at the thought of it is actually acutely physical; I have to vomit.  Why, you might ask, hasn't this become apparent to me before? Well, quite honestly, I just haven't been rejected very often. This is simply extremely good luck on my part. I can't lay claim to being either a great beauty or particularity good company. I simply ended up with very easy-going men, I think.  I realize that my tactic to avoid this is to be submissive. You see, if I'm never sexually aggressive, then... I cannot possibly be rejected. It's that simple. Oh god, how droll.  That is MY  urlLink  pavlovian ape  . Just as tortuous and trigger-happy as  urlLink  Conrad's  , it seems, or perhaps more so. So, in rejecting a part of his own personality, I saw it as a subtle yet definite rejection of me.   On a positive note, it makes me extremely easy and pleasant to break up with. :-)  As to it's origins? I have absolutely no idea.   rg

      Watersports. How does everyone feel about this? Have you ever done it? Would you ever do it. If so, under what circumstances? Inquiring minds want to know    My first encounter with anything involving watersports was when my ex-husband's brother who worked on a garbage barge brought home this magazine that had come off a Japanese freighter. The magazine was a little intimidating and smelled a little ripe too. Moreover, it was completely in Japanese.  It had cartoon pictures of clearly under-age girls urinating. And I thought... yup, well, been there, done that, but nobody made a drawing of it. I had a very hard time conceiving of it as erotic at all. It didn't offend me, it just didn't turn me on. Maybe that's because I grew up in a country where people routinely peed on the street as public lavatories were in rather short supply in Madrid in those days.  Since then, I've actually met several people who are great fans of watersports and have tried to explain what the attraction is. They invariably start out by telling me just how hygienic urine really is. This doesn't phase me one way or the other. Kissing people is not very hygienic either, but I do it.  At what must have been an impressionable age, I remember seeing a film involving a French woman who had had an affair with a Nazi officer during the German occupation of France. Once Liberation seemed imminent, the townsfolk (my, aren't they always such a nice pleasant bunch?) proceeded to shave her head, kick her down the main street and finished up by peeing all over her.  It kind of stuck.  I just can't see myself, in any frame of mind, letting someone pee on me. I can't seem to separate the act from degradation in my mind. And that is not something I'm all that turned on by.  On the other hand, I could probably be persuaded, albeit reluctantly, to pee on someone I cared a lot about if I though it was going to get them off. (Ok. I'm not a real sub... Yeah, I've heard that so don't bother. Might I persuade you to consider me generous?)  Any thoughts on this, guys and gals. I'd really like to hear some other points of view.

      I was considering deleting the post I made a couple of posts ago. It's sitting there staring at me like a HUGE " I told you so, you STUPID, STUPID WOMAN ". Very humiliating, really. But I'm going to try and be real about it. I did say it was for your entertainment... and so is this one   Bliatz said that I was very good at   guestimating   the time... one week to the day. Yes, I'm fucking brilliant at that sort of thing. I'm sitting here waiting for the frisson of smug pride that should be spidering its way down my back any minute now.  It was the sweetest, most complex and self-blaming  fuck off  letter I have ever had. Actually, it's the only one I've ever had. The knife was so exquisitely sharp, I hardly felt it cut at all.   Please read it.  urlLink Because it's actually very beautiful.   But for lazy readers or people with poor vocabularies or the peanut gallery who just want's me to hurry up and get to the end of the story, I'll paraphrase.   It says:   You'd be wise to stay away from me, because if you love me, I'm going to hurt myself.    And I say:   I absolutely understand, and I care for you too much to be the cause of that. So...I'll back away now before any damage gets done.   Exactly a week... and yes, I am crying.  rg

      We've kind of meandered around this discussion before: what's a REAL sub, who's a REAL dom, is 24/7 lifestyle the ONLY way to really be in a TRUE D/s relationship. And that's just peek over the edge into a pretty foetid cauldron of smugly held opinions... And please, nobody even MENTION anarchism.  I do it. I do it without thinking and without wanting to hurt or label someone. I didn't set out to pigeon-hole them when I called them a pain-slut, or a sadist or a doormat. Because it is quite possible that they are, in fact, that thing - along with a whole bunch of other things.  We all do it, because it's simply so much easier to find the tag and hang it on the victim than to look at the complexity of who they are. Shit, you might get embroiled in all sorts of messy shit! And some of it might stick!  And the net makes it easier. We start acting like bad search algorithms; classifying people in the most simplistic, easily recallable manner. We code them, label them and file 'em away.  I surf around the net and I see an awful lot of judgment. And little by little it is taking a toll on my patience. What's more, for all these staunchly held opinions, very few people are energetic enough and research what their talking about before they mouth off.  We were chatting, Conrad and I, and he said, "You aren't a submissive." I think I followed with "Am too!", or something equally infantile. Then he said, "No, it doesn't define you, it's not the whole of you. You aren't trapped in it." (you'll all forgive me, I'm paraphrasing here)  In any case, it occurred to me that, if we are guilty of judging others, we are even guiltier of judging ourselves.  rg

            I met the One online. I know its not classy, or traditional, or smart. But He's the One and i don't care how i had to meet him. I waited all my life for Him. We moved in circles around Texas, in time with each other, carefully missing each other. Who knows if we glanced up and saw the other, only to look away out of fear and unknowing?  The hours we spent online talking, not able to touch, not able to smell, not able to do anything "real" led us here.   Here: where we paint our bedroom, and pick up kids form camp and are as mundane as humanly possible. And have never been happier.  This is what i want for you all. No matter where you find it   . -->

      I know you are all going to giggle and roll your eyes ( I can hear the derisive comments in the gallery already). I'm going to talk to you boys and girls about a very special kind of submission...   It's the one you don't get tied up for. It's the one you do all by yourself, cursing yourself miserably all the way down onto your knees. The one you know is unwise and not in the least bit sensible. The one you suspect will end in tears (and not those kind of tears, you pain sluts!).  And you are going to go over and read Conrad's  urlLink blog , and then you are either going to understand, or not.  You are all very important to me. I care for you all very much. I know you're going to think that forming this kind of an emotional attachment to someone you met online is foolish. And all the good advice and cautionary tales you are going to give me will be apt and well-meaning. But right at this moment, he is the only thing that shines. I'm infatuated and smitten and, I AM going to say it, in love.  Yeah, it could all end tomorrow - that will be just fine. It is worth it.

      Now we get to the meat of the story. I know I've been rambling but I thought it was important to let you understand that, for all my pretensions at open-mindedness and an interest in the 'darker arts', I was still very young and not really prepared for what I was about to witness...   In a room the size of a small church hall, done out in greys, blacks and burgundies, I did as I was told and looked bored and arrogant. It wasn't very medieval at all. It actually looked like a cross between a very expensive pr lounge and a dentist's office.   When you're scared, bored and arrogant is a very good disguise. I have used it to cover stage-fright very effectively. So that evening, while watching Cookie, and then two other women, impose varying amounts of pain and humiliation on a number of undressed, middle-aged, not very attractive men, I looked bored and arrogant and spent a good portion of my time talking myself out of vomiting.  Nothing will ever prepare you for the first time you watch a man weep and jerk-off at the same time. Now, still looking bored and arrogant, I had conquered my need to puke and replaced it with an overwhelming desire to get on my knees and put my arms around him. None of which would do at all - that much was perfectly clear.  The other thing that was clear was that Cookie was very good at her job. She enjoyed it. Whether it was background or race or sexual wiring, I don't know; we never spoke that intimately. But Cookie loved to make a grown white man cry. Her eyes would start to shine, her voice would get high and strident, and her strokes would get harder. I'm pretty sure she got off on it.  The British public school system does leave you with one indelible scar. It gives you very good self-control. And thought I am not going to go into the details of what I did for the next two months, I will admit that it was the money that kept me there that long.  I have fisted people, paddled them, suspended them, placed cock-rings around their genitals and tied their balls up with elastic (for very short periods, btw). I have stepped, with my heel on the loose skin of the scrotum of a man who then wept and licked my feet for doing it. I have made men dress up like babies. I think I may have seen 200 men spill their seed onto the same dark carpet, whimpering as they were whipped, choked, prodded, tugged or buggered to orgasm.  Never once in two months did I ever feel the slightest twinge of arousal. I felt pity, disgust, boredom, and hatred. But I never once got turned on. I was simply too young to even begin to understand what this meant to the men I did this to.   I was, as Conrad put it, a male sub's worst nightmare.   Many years later, I have a much better understanding of what those men were looking for. I don't have pity for them anymore. I know they were getting what they wanted - it was a perfectly equitable transaction. But the idea of doing something even close to that now still fills me with horror. Not because I couldn't do it but because I now realize what you need to have inside you to do it well.   You really need to love these men. You need to see through their eyes and feel through their skin and take them through the door of ecstasy accepting of why they need to get there this way. It takes marking your heart with their trust and being awe-struck (privately) by the responsibility of that trust.  I'm just not that strong a person.

      It could be because some people don't read the whole post, just the title, or perhaps because I'm obviously a bossy bitch when I'm blogging... Or maybe it's something else. Whatever the cause, I've had something of a flood of emails that have started with the salutation: Dear Mistress... I'd like to put a stop to that, with a cautionary tale.   When I was younger and in a band, I spent 9 months in San Francisco tied to a record contract that kept me there but paid no money. At first, just having a record deal was very exciting and, to be fair, the company did put us up in an apartment in the Mission district. We survived, living a pretty hand-to-mouth existence, on gig proceeds and a lot of Kraft Dinner.  Being the only female in the band, I sought the comfort of a woman's company at the apartment down the hall. I met and became friends with an African American girl named "Cookie" - yeah, that was her actual, christened name - she was from Georgia.  Our friendship grew and I found myself, one day, sitting at her funky, pink, melamine dinnette set complaining about being broke, again. She flicked her wicked and elaborately beaded tresses back with a whistling swish. "Quit ya complainin', girl!" She said. "If ya'll need money, I can git ya a job. Part-time like." (Oh, I wish I could reproduce Cookie's accent for you, it was the stuff of canned peaches - syrupy with a little tang).  Quite honestly, I had always assumed that Cookie was "a lady of the night." I'd never actually asked outright... And she had never said outright. She seemed to have her days to herself and I'd seen Cookie walking out of the building of an evening wearing some extremely come hither clothes - leather or vinyl mostly. Plus, Cookie was always flush for money. She had, on more than one occassion, made me presents of outrageously expensive tubes of lipstick. So, I had assumed she belonged to that old and venerable profession.  Now, my hypocrisy came into play. I had been brought up to respect a person, no matter what their profession and, quite specifically, to have a good deal of respect for women who chose to make theirs prostitution. The reason for this is the basis of another story entirely (later). But the prospect of actually being paid to spread my legs for men I didn't know and wasn't attracted to, scared the living daylights out of me. I've always been pragmatic. If I were ever faced with actual starvation, I'm sure my squeamishness would have evaporated pretty fast. But I wasn't actually starving.  I desperately didn't want to offend Cookie or reject her generous offer out of hand, but I had to find a way to politely explain that I wasn't ready, quite yet, to join that trade. I needn't have worried. She took one look at the thinly veiled horror on my face and said: "Shit, girl! Not THAT way!" She was at the kitchen table, applying single false eyelashes while we talked. "Lord! You though I was a workin' girl, didn't'cha?"  She laughed (fit to burst, as she'd put it) and I blushed and stammered. But the long and short of it was that Cookie was not a prostitute. She was, as she put it, in the discipline business. She admitted that it was not a completely unrelated field of endeavor but that there was a very important distinction: nobody laid a hand on Cookie without her permission.  This is where all the book learning in the world doesn't help you. Having been a precocious teenager, I had read " urlLink Justine " by De Sade and " urlLink Venus in Furs " by Sacher-Masoch. This was all very exciting adolescent reading but didn't help me a bit when Cookie decided to patiently explain what she did for a living.  She worked at an establishment called the "Chateau" from 8 pm till 2 am, five nights a week and she said that she would ask her boss if I could come in for an interview. "Ya'll betta borrow some clothes, though...." she quipped, looking me up and down and finding me lacking. "And take out that nose ring girl! Or else someone's gonna try and lead ya 'round by it!"  To be entirely honest, Cookie's explanation didn't help much and, in retrospect, nothing she could have said would have prepared me for what I encountered. Some things you just have to experience for yourself...   I had become Cookie's "project". The next morning at ten, she rang my doorbell, dragged me down the hall and pulled me into her apartment. The sofa was buried under a mountain of clothes. "Problem is...y'aint got no tits, girl!"   "So...It's on then." I had played an alternative lesbian "night" in Haight Street the night before and the whole employment thing had slipped my mind in a wave of free vodkas and tentative questions as to my sexual orientation.   "Tamorah...night. If ya still wanna."   Oh, there was a date and a time. I was torn between a state of extreme fear and hypnotic curiosity. (I've always been terribly drawn to the darker side of human nature...if only as a daytripping observer.) "Are you absolutely positive I don't have to fuck anyone?" I asked Cookie as I picked up and looked at garments, whose implementation escaped me, off her couch.   Thus began a very long morning of explanation as to what, exactly, someone in "the discipline business" did. I giggled, I cringed and I make sour-faces but what worried me the most was just my physical size. "Cookie... this isn't going to work... I'm 5'2"! I couldn't present a physical threat to a piece of roadkill!"   "It ain't yo size, sugar (yes, she did call me "sugar"), it's yo voice. You GOT the voice. I heard you talking to those boys in your band.... you'll do jus fine."   [I realize this has become a short story and I'm nowhere near explaining why I should never be a dominant...apologies.]   Anyway, yes. The next evening saw Cookie pulling me into the back of a cab dressed in something UNBELIEVABLY uncomfortable, which made rude noises as I slid across the seat. Don't ever let anyone tell you that leather corsets are comfortable (I don't care whether they are made of kid or fetal goat - you sweat and the sweat goes nowhere. And they have whalebone down the sides, which digs in painfully if you sit down or bend over.). And don't let anyone tell you that 4-inch black vinyl stiletto boot are something you will get used to, because unless you have no nerve endings in your lower body, you won't. The best you can hope for is a tingly numbness.   The interview was unbelievably odd. It was conducted by a VERY effeminate, dapper gentleman in his late 50's with something approaching a blue rinse. He was polite; I was polite. He seemed pleased that I had been on stage and, after hearing that I had been schooled in the UK, asked if I could do a convincing English accent. I asked if he wanted "Horsey" or "Beeb". That seemed to put the issue to rest.  "Look, just watch until you're comfortable... alright? Look bored and arrogant. We'll give it a week and see how you do."  Just like that. I hope to God it isn't still done that way. No one should have let me do this.  N.B. Both   Venus in Furs   and   Justine   are available in downloadable text format on the net. If you haven't read them, you should.

      After my initial post calling for experiences with online Domming, I received two pieces of feedback. One is a short essay on it written by Fidelis who has found a way to make it work...    So how does an online relationship work? Like any D/s relationship, we have a set of rules, we have a contract, we have established procedures. I control her sexual activities, totally. I train her, I discipline her, if necessary I punish her. The only difference is, I'm not there to do it in person.  Obviously if I tell her to do something ('put the clamps on your nipples') I have no guarantee she is doing it. (Photographs might help, but we have not moved to that stage yet.) If I deny her orgasm (orgasm control is a major form of activity for us), I cannot be certain she is not masturbating furiously. But we figured out early on that there would be no point for her in just pretending to obey me. What could possibly be the satisfaction in that? Why would she even want to? She'd be fooling herself as well as me. And now, after nine months that we've been doing this, I think I would have a sense if she was playing me false.  I have to be especially responsive, try to judge from her written replies what is the effect of my orders. But fundamentally it's no different from real-time relationships. When the Dom goes out of the door, how can he be sure his sub is not pleasuring herself, or has just removed her butt plug, contrary to instructions? It's just with us the trust has to be stronger. Not much chance of catching her out, of coming home unexpectedly to find the sub in flagrante with her favourite vibrator.   It's not an ideal situation. I would like to spank her, whip her, cane her. She would like me to. I cannot. It wouldn't work if she were to do these things to herself. Maybe in their monkish cells, religious fanatics can whip themselves into a frenzy, but in our experience you need two-way interaction to get fun from that sort of physical discipline. So we have to be inventive and find other things to do which press the submissive button. Some involve the infliction of pain, some do not.  We email a dozen times a day. She gets teased a lot, led to the brink of coming but with orgasm postponed or denied. I tell her what to wear, and what not to wear. She has to do slutty things (she has a deeply slutty nature but until she met me she had kept it tightly repressed), like going out with no knickers on, and a few worse things than that. I write her stories in which she acts out her more daring fantasies. We plan to meet one day soon.  By:  urlLink FidelisBlue@aol.com ,07/22/04

      and because I couldn't think of anything else to write about and my "why I shouldn't be a Domme" post is still on the back-burner, I will continue on with a subject that seems to make some of you squirm in your seats. (Not in the nicest of ways...but friction results, nonetheless)... word origins    I've done some research on the word  cunt , Subbies, and found some interesting things:      Tom Aldridge  called it: " unarguably the most obscene [and] most forbidden word in English "    Andrew Goldman  called it: " the mother of all nasty words " and " the most controversial word of all "    John Doran  called it: " the worst word that anyone has ever been able to think of "   Methinks the gentlemen doth protest too much!!! And notice that it's all gentlemen? Where's  Germaine Greer's  take on this? Well, actually, she doesn't seem to have a problem with the word. She says: "  The cunt must come into its own  ."   Ok.... on to the etymology:    The clearest method of structuring the complex etymology of 'cunt' is to approach it letter by letter. Its prefix, 'cu', is an expression of "quintessential femineity" (Eric Partridge, 1961), confirming the status of 'cunt' as a truly feminine term. The synonymy between 'cu' and femininity was in place even before the development of written language: "in the unwritten prehistoric Indo-European [...] languages 'cu' or 'koo' was a word base expressing 'feminine', 'fecund' and associated notions" (Tony Thorne, 1990). The proto-Indo-European 'cu' is also cognate with other feminine/vaginal terms, such as the Hebrew 'cus', the Arabic 'cush' and 'kush', and the Nostratic 'kuni' ('woman').    Please note that I pasted this lock-stock-and barrel from a very good dissertation written by  Matthew Hunt  (who's name rhymes with cunt, and I do have to wonder if his obsession with the word didn't stem from early childhood verbal beatings in the school yard).   urlLink Cunt: A Cultural History   is an interesting read - but it  IS  a dissertation (and so one tends to skim it and go "yadda, yadda" rather a lot)  Here's the bottom line as I see it.  I WANT THAT WORD FOR ME . When my discrete flower of womanhood is sitting there doing nothing much, it's a pussy. But, like I said before, when it's hungry... it's a  cunt .  Nexy etymological journey (yeah, you guessed it):  pussy . And you'll be surprised. It doesn't come from where you thought it did...

      That made you look, didn't it?  Actually, the topic is on word usage and how it's used in D/s play. Or, as Bliatz would say: Dirt Talk...  this is, of course, extremely subjective. One person's love-patter is another person's insult.  CUNT: Actually being able to bring myself to type the word was very liberating for me the first time I did. Perhaps because in the UK is is so often used as an insult. I usually refer to my nether regions as my pussy. But this is very twee - just a couple of steps up from "my woo woo", really. But when I'm in sub mode, it's most definitely my cunt.  In fact language, as a whole, takes on a very different level of complexity in sub-mode. I absolutely crave to hear myself called things that, if someone ever called me at any other time, would elicit violence from me.   But, I'm very particular in sub-mode, even. I don't want to be just anyone's "slut". I want to be a slut for someone in particular. Ditto for whore, strumpet, fuck-toy, or anything else (It just occured to me that google is going to go crazy over this post). In essence, the sexual name needs to be tagged with an ownership - a possession (oh, you have no idea how hard it is to admit that!).  On any given day, in the big wide world, if I hear any woman being called a slut, I'm very likely to confront the person with a barrage of feminist diatribe. But get me alone in a room and purr it in my ear and I'm just so much putty in the hand.  Context is everything...What's yours?

      Well, this is something I really know nothing about and frankly I am suspicious about how you are supposed to feel that lovely sting on the skin of your backside...digitally. But I have been assured that it is possible.   So... ladies, gentlemen...please. Is it possible? Does it work? Was it silly?   No, I don't want ridiculous tales of some 17 year-old with Dom aspirations messaging you with "suck it bitch!"   I'm interested in hearing about genuine efforts at control, successful or failed.   If you are not a member of This Big Hush but would like to offer your story, please email it to  urlLink me . It get's you a link at the very least!    Editor's Note:      Due to a number of emails I have received, I'd like to make it clear what I mean by a " call for submissions ". I don't want you to " SUBMIT " to me.&nbsp; I am, for the most part, not inclined that way (no matter how "Dommy" you percieve me to be).&nbsp; Also, I am not really prepared to play 20 questions with you - because I don't really know where to even start.&nbsp; I'm not asking about the subject as a way to get vicarious thrills; I have thrills of my own, thank you.     &nbsp;  I'm asking about this because I think a good number of HUSH readers have considered the possibility of this sort of a relationship and would like to know if it's actually feasible. If you could be so kind as to write something of an essay on your experience, that would be of great value!    Thanks... rg

      After reading Magdala's comment and answering her via email, I thought this would be a good topic to bring to a more general forum on domination and controlling desire in submissives.   There are women - rare, I'll grant you - who are born and grow up never hiding their desire for a moment. I've met a few and, I notice, they are strong women. A friend of mine, Vanessa, is like this. It's not that her door is always open (metaphorically speaking) or open for everybody; it's that, when she chooses to open it for someone, it's ALL there. No inhibitions, no holding back, ravenous and almost terrifying in it's intensity. She has boundaries - careful ones that she has constructed, not out of fear but out of her own sense of pleasure. She could never be a submissive because, quite frankly, she doesn't need any of the mechanisms that are present and important in a D/s relationship.  Somehow, these types of women have managed to emerge undeformed by the ever-present, baseline mantra of our society that whispers:  good girls don't do this, lust is bad, your appetite is a thing to be feared and buried and kept secret...even from yourself.   And it's not just women. There are men for whom this is equally a problem or, for whom the desire isn't the problem, but the focus of the desire is.  Most of us, no matter how liberated we might think we are, have an incredibly hard time breaking through the veil of those insidious condemnations. Even when we know quite well how utterly ridiculous they are.  I think that one of the most interesting aspects of D/s is that, at it's core, it entails a mechanism by which the door gets opened and a permission for what's behind it is given - not just permission, but validation. And because this creature has been kept hidden, suppressed, despised and feared for so long, when the door does open on it... what comes out is almost overwhelming. It's very a very young, immature and extremely hungry drive. It has no restraint, no direction, yet. It's like a kid with ADD.  What unlocks the door is different for each person. It can be pain or language or bondage, or even force (consensual, of course). For some people, feeling that collar lock on is like feeling the universe open up before them. For others, it's more complicated... it takes a combination of some or all of them at differing degrees of intensity.  The danger is that once you've done this to someone (and frankly, if you have even a moderate knowlege of psychology, it isn't that hard to do), you know just how delicious the outpouring can be. And what idiot would   not   want to be standing at the gates just as all this stuff comes flooding through?  But, poor Pandora! Because all that desire can get a little much to take, a little hard to satisfy, and hey, you don't want that kind of a wild beast roaming around the countryside or the UPS office.  Here's what separates the Pandoras from the Dominants. Dominants (real ones) recognize that this force is in need of direction, focus, and training. They don't deny you orgasm because they are feeling threatened or in a bad mood that day. They do it to establish control; to construct the mechanism by which the flood is made non-self-destructive to the submissive. In essence, they have to teach you how to control it - so it doesn't eat you.  It takes a tremendous amount of restraint and discipline on the part of the dominant. And there are lots of lovers who like to stand in the flow, but few who want to, or can, take the responsibility for channelling it properly.  Opening the door isn't a one time thing. It takes a lot of visits to that place, over time. But slowly, surely, under the right supervision, the door begins to open easily and what's behind it gets easier to control. Until one day, it becomes a force you direct with ease and confidence.  That's when, of course, the D/s relationship changes. It doesn't die but it mutates into something more comfortable. And for some people, that means the end of it.

      I think I might be ... sort of ... on the verge of ... or something ... falling in love with someone I met online.   Yes, it's very ironic, given some of the posts here recently.   Thing is, I hate being in love. I hate liking someone enough to let down some of my walls.&nbsp; Because when I get disappointed, it's like a deep sucker punch in my gut.  I have no idea if it has anything to do with me being submissive or what, but if someone lets me down (even if it's not their fault) I feel like it was something personal, and I even -cry- about it.  Yes. Cry. Even if it's something small.  And I hate that. I think it makes me inherently weak. I hate the thought that I might be weak on the inside ... I hate letting people affect me like that. I would rather be painfully independant.  And since that's what's happened today (even though it was just a mistake), I think I'll be rebuilding some walls.  Okay, I'm rambling horribly. Hodgepodge post. Eek, right? I don't think I'll even bother to spellcheck this one.

      Remittance Girl's post about her father made me think of all that I have discovered about myself in relation to my parents over the years.  My father adopted me when he married my mother, I was two years old. (my birth father's name was forged on the documents... I didn't meet him until I was 23) All I remember of my father is him being mad constantly  and the rest of us tiptoeing around so as not to provoke him...and get yelled at, or hit... in the last few years I had refused to go see him, because he always found a way to insult me, and I would go home with no self-esteem left.   He died in May, and I never got the chance to "settle" things... I wish I would have, although he wouldn't have apologized, or changed his "tune", but I would have felt better about myself for letting him know how I felt. I think he has a lot to do with how I react to men... the promiscuity, the drugs that I went through in high school - all for wanting to be accepted and loved by a man. I still have to fight myself to not go out with anyone who asks me, and changing my personality to "fit" a man's just to get that feeling of acceptance.  RG was lucky that her mother defended her. My mother (still) has always told me I never do anything right... and "Why can't you be like your sister?"  I think my relationship with her is at least part of the reason that I have never had really close girlfriends, and don't trust other women easily...  I have always thought that I am an adult now, I can't blame my family for things in my life,  I know better... but my knowledge doesn't always go to my heart... or my self esteem... my emotions don't know better....  The older I get, the more "at home" in my own life I become. I still tend to be afraid to follow up on most of my "dreams". I really hate being so dependent on what others think, but I'm constantly working on it... and I'm getting there.

       urlLink Shimmer  suggested I go and read the blog of a woman called  urlLink Magdala . She said it was raw - very raw, but good. And it is. The first post I read there got me to thinking (always a dicey thing) about need and what happens when you let it out...    Tennesee Williams, like a number of Southern-born writers, has a way with painting desire that's palpable; you can almost taste the metallic tang of it on the tip of your tongue when you read his plays. Quite a number of the films made from them are excellent: "Sweet Bird of Youth", "The Tattoo Rose", "A Streetcar Named Desire"... but it's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" that haunted me a long time.  What has all this to do with Magdala's blog?  Desire. Need. Want.   I think there is a very deep fear of female desire. Not just in women, but in many societies. I could list cultural references to examples of this but I won't (I'm feeling a little lazy) and I hope you will at least suspend your disbelief for a moment, if you aren't fully in agreement.  My interest, though, is in the fear I think a lot of women have about their own desire. That unleashed it will devour them, their lives, their family, their world.  Magdala worries about what she might do the the UPS man now; now that her door is open literally and figuratively.  Lovers - Doms/Dommes - in particular, love unlocking that door. It gives them both power and pleasure. It creates a burning pyre in the middle of their living room and not a small amount of ego gratification... someone to crawl to them on hands and knees begging for it; yes, very nice.  The problem is that being responsible for the force of that desire is often more than most Dominants can handle. Either because it's strong enough to slip the reigns or because it ends up scaring them.  One of the principal reasons why I don't have a Dom, is exactly this. I have only ever met one person in my life who I really thought was not only responsible enough and actually capable of being in control of my desire.   Otherwise, I will rely on my own control...which is pretty good.

       urlLink   Following on from our post on online Dommes and several wounded hearts later, I would like to address the problem of personality constructs. Creating contructs of people you either despise or adore is not unique to the online world, but in an environment where your contact is text at worst and voice and fuzzy video at best, the danger that one might create a construct is much more likely.    What do I mean by a construct?    People have a tendency to extrapolate on the information in their possession. Overall, this is a good thing. It stops us having to reinvent the wheel every time we encounter someone or something new. For example, if I meet a 65-year old woman at a cocktail party, I'm going to make some quick assumptions about her: She probably doesn't listen to a lot of  Korn , she is likely to either be married now or have been married, there is a good chance she has experienced pregnancy. This is not to say that there aren't 65-year old females that DO listen to Korn, have never been married and are virgins. They exist. But statistically, they are a small percentage of all the 65-year old females out there.  This ability to extrapolate on previous experience and available information is normally pretty useful. But it can, as we all know, also lead to false assumptions that might really hurt the person you are extrapolating about.  When you build a construct, you go past extrapolation and into the realm of fantasy. You meet someone and, lacking sufficient information, create a persona in your mind to answer to their name. You are likely to make this persona to suit your own desires - to put them on a pedestal and see them as a shining example of everything you are looking for in a friend or a love or you do the opposite; you demonize them, creating a hideously irredeemable villain of them.  Sometimes, because the desire to encounter this "ideal" is so great, you even ignore obvious contradictions. So no matter how many clues you are getting that this person is in fact abusive, manipulative or condescending, you willfully ignore those signs and instead endow them with shining character traits of respectfulness, patience, or trustworthiness that correspond to your image of an ideal Dom.  When you are getting along with someone, they turn you on, or flatter you... it's extremely hard to keep your eye on the clues. And your ability to fool yourself is directly proportional to how much you want them (need them) to be what you dream of.  What is worse, once you start to realize that perhaps this is not the person you thought they were, you actually blame them for disappointing you - for falling short of the construct you have created of them. Because it hurts that they weren't what you thought they were.  But it doesn't just hurt you, it hurts the person you projected this onto. If they're smart, they now realize that you never REALLY liked them at all. You liked the construct. They begin to suspect that all the interactions they have had with you were built on a completely false premise. You have dehumanized them - you have refused to like or dislike them for what they really were.  Finally, recovering a friendship that was established on constructed personalities and has now been exposed for the sham it is, is almost impossible. The breach of trust on both sides means that they are probably not going to trust you to ever "see them for what they really are" and you are probably not going to trust that they won't "let you down again."  The net is not the only place this happens. About 8 years ago, I fell head over heels in love with this man who was a poet, intense and brooding, serious and deep, intellectual and passionate. Well, as it turns out, he wasn't any of those things...poor man. He was just an ordinary human being. But I WANTED that construct so badly, I projected all those qualities onto him. Then, when it turned out that he wasn't any of them, I thought he was a total bastard for destroying my dream. And this was IRL!!!! Okay, I'll admit I wasn't completely sane at the time. :-)  For the first time in my life, I've now been on the receiving end of this. It has been an extraordinary, if somewhat depressing, experience. My first reaction was dismay... because I try so hard online to be clear about who I am and what I am. I write nauseously long blog posts on how fucked up and flawed I am. I don't want someone to like me, only if they gloss over all my bad points. I want them to like me for the rather ordinary, if a little messed up, person that I really am.  When I realised that the construct this person had superimposed on me was something truly hideous to me. Something unreal and fantastical. I felt... well... pornographized. (I can't think of another way to put it.)  Have you made constructs, or been the subject of one?

      I've been having some very interesting chats with Rose and Conrad and it led me to a couple of questions. Is the HUSH so female-centric that we put off most male submissives from participating? Also, how different are male and female submissives? Are their desires the same? Are their means of achieving them the similar?   So...I went on a little survey to see what I could see. There are very few male submissive blogs out there! There are lot's of Mistress sites targeted at male subs... but the male subs don't seem to be talking much.   Anyone got some leads?  rg

      Rose's comment on Yen's last post percolated for a couple of hours. It struck me as important because it touched on something that I think is essentially at the heart of what many people seek in a D/s experience. And it went some way to linking the dichotomy between Tangerine's search for discipline and Yen's craving for chaos…      The quieting of the critical mind.   (I don't mean a criticizing mind – that is negative. I'm speaking of your ability to quantify and qualify, to measure things and experiences, to judge their appropriateness based on a lifetime's worth of experience.)    At the dawn of the 21st Century in the Western world, rationalism has become our master. And, in my opinion, it isn't a bad thing for the most part. We've stopped burning witches and we no longer treat schizophrenics with exorcism.   We analyze experiences by perceiving them, breaking them down into their parts, identify those parts and assess their relational aspects, judge it as either good or bad, and then slap a name on it. And for the most part, it's a good thing.   The problem is that it feels cold and unemotional and it's not creative. It is wholly unrelated to the "spirit". It allows us to make sense of things, on a rational level. But the very act of thinking critically or analytically exiles us from the emotional impact.   Skip the babble… what it denies us is the ability to say: "Fuck, this feels REAL."   I don't mean REAL as in – yes, I know this to be true. I mean the kind of REAL feeling where the truth of something sinks down past your skin and lodges itself in your gut or your heart. In short, an ecstatic experience.   So how does this provide unification between Tangerine's search for discipline and Yen's search for chaos.   Simple – different subs get release from their critical mind in different ways.   Discipline can draw your mind down into focus. The safety of the boundaries can relieve you of the need to think critically. From there, you are free to think only creatively - to feel without judgment or measurement.   Release can do the same. It can jettison you to places where your critical mind no longer serves as an appropriate navigational tool at all, forcing you to "feel" your way creatively.   There is no rationalism, no analytical thought, possible in sub-space. It is a languageless, mathless place where the visceral and the ecstatic join and become reality.   I think it is why we are so vulnerable, because the drive to get there is very strong and once there, we have, in fact, temporarily, relinquished our critical mind. And the only way that can be done safely is with a person you trust to have one for you.

      Does submissiveness really boil down to the intelligent mind's innocent need for discipline?    That surprised me. I'd never really thought of it that way. I'd never considered the possibility that maybe it's discipline that calls some to submit. It's an alien concept because I am submissive for exactly the opposite reason.    Intelligence is chaos. It's a supersonic nano-highway of thought collisions, and it doesn't take very long before we realize the need for some discipline. Having been raised Catholic, I'm expected to have had authoritarian parents-- the kind that kept their daughters in long-sleeved shirts and floor-length skirts and watched ominously from the door over their every interaction with the opposite sex. It wasn't like that at all. I've never had many rules or punishments (I've never even been grounded), and I've never had much guidance either. I was raised to discipline myself. It's personal responsibility, or self-governance, or self-control.    Discipline isn't something I seek. In fact, I take it as a personal insult when anyone tries to give it to me, especially if I've clearly communicated to them that this is what is off bounds. I punish myself far more harshly and hold myself up to much higher standards than anyone ever could. I am careful to reward myself when I decide (through much analysis) that I deserve it. Discipline is character-forming, and in my opinion it is too intimate a responsibility and privilege to hand to anyone else. It's my duty to myself.    What I seek, and where my submission comes from, is chaos. I've rigged so many intellectual alarms to sound off at the slightest vibration that I've forgotten what it's like to simply think, or feel, or love, or hate, or write, without suppressing myself with "should" and "should not". My submission is the child of my desire to go back to where I was, to remember what I was like before my mind learned to temper intelligence with caution.    My submissiveness isn't a need for discipline; it is the need for a deconstruction of it-- a systematized reintroduction to true chaos.

      I never really had considered what Tangerine has proposed; that submission might be a craving for discipline. I, like Yen, didn't have extremely disciplinarian parents. Certainly, they didn't actually have much self-discipline themselves and I don't have much either, except in one fanatic sense...   I don't have that many principles. It's not that I am immoral but I do have some capacity for seeing things from other people's point of view - even if I don't agree with them. Moreover, I absolutely believe they have the right to hold differing viewpoints.  Except on three issues: racism, sexism and a person's right to dominion over his/her own body.    I deeply believe that all people are born of equal worth; no matter what race, colour, sex, gender-orientation, etc. I believe this ABSOLUTELY.   I also believe that dominion - absolute dominion - over your own body is an absolute right. That includes both abortion and suicide. I abhor both; both are massive failures of the system. But I believe ultimately, what happens to your body is your business. That doesn't mean that doing things to your body can't hurt other people, it can. But you have the ultimate veto.  And it's not that I don't support people's right to hold other opinions on these issues; it's just that, if they do, I must withdraw my company.  I have, on a number of occassions, walked away from people I loved over these principles. I have lost friends, companionship, jobs, money, prestige... over these principles. This is a discipline I impose on myself. It is cruel and fanatical. I will allow myself no wiggle-room on the issue, no sort-ofs, no maybes, no under-certain-circumstances.  The best I have managed over the years is simply not to ask. If I don't know your stand on any of these issues, I don't have to walk away from you. And I have lost so many friends on this that, the older I get, the less I ask. But, from time to time I do, if the issue comes up... And it did today. And I lost an extraordinary friend. It hurts terribly, but it is the only discipline I impose on myself. And perhaps for that reason alone, it is the one I must maintain.  What, at it's core, does this have to do with submission?  The only way I can give dominion of my body over to someone else, is if I've had absolute dominion over it in the first place. Otherwise, it wouldn't be mine to give away.

      "Only those with higher intelligence require discipline."  ~ Quote from "Dark Angel" Series One.    I missed this series deeply, wanting my Jessica Alba fix on disc (both seasons)  for my own selfish reasons.    When I heard the above quote spoken it made me thing of RG and what she is trying to accomplish here. The Understanding of why we are what we are. Digging a lil deeper while looking around at the others ......   It makes me feel better knowing the lean toward submissiveness might be an intelligence requirement instead of a replacement for a non-loving father. I always thought it was a daddy thing.    As children, we receive (require) our discipline from our parents. Growing up it is handed to us out of love in the hopes of steering us in the right direction. It was nothing more than a parental obligation.    As adults, what happens to the need for discipline? Our parents find themselves fighting to step away instead of intervening in our lives. Allowing us the room to grow and discover. It deprives us of a basic need we seek find fulfillment elsewhere.    Writing from the hip, I find that as adults it makes perfect sense to seek out our need in sexual situations. The need to be told what to do and feeling good about meeting the requirements of our lovers.    In another sense, personal this time, we become self disciplined to the point of hurting ourselves both menatally and physically for breaking (personal) rules and requirements we set up for ourselves. At the same time, rewarding ourselves in simplistic ways for following through on our objectives.    Does submissiveness really boil down to the intelligent mind's innocent need for discipline?

      OK, I made an off the cuff remark on my earlier post that has gotten me into hot water and I feel the need to explain and to expand.   I never meant to suggest for a moment that   urlLink Mistress Matisse   would force anyone to do anything! Ever. I think she's a very responsible person who has high regards for people's limits. It's my limits I'm not so sure of. :-)   As people who read this blog often will know, I am something of a mild masochist and I do have a fetish regarding blood and cutting. This isn't about sensation for me. It's a deeply psychological thing. I have long suspected that it is not a very healthy part of my psyche. I suspect that it is rather badly self-destructive. I am not convinced that feeding that particular fetish is good for me. Perhaps when I figure out it's origins, I will decide differently, but until then, I tend to stay away from people who I suspect might "enable" it.  So,it was purely on the basis that I think MM is such an alluring and compelling person, and because I suspect my desire to please would "enable" fetishes that I am not terribly comfortable with indulging at the moment, that I said that I would not get within 100 miles of her. I have (psychological) limits on certain fetishes that I would go past eagerly with the least bit of encouragement and, until I sort out why I am dubious about them, I would rather not be confronted with anyone who might accept them or encourage them. (Does that make sense?)  Regarding Mistress Matisse:  I admire her, respect her, and would most certainly find her incredibly attractive. I believe her to be a deeply intuitive person and a genuinely caring one. I would most certainly trust her. I just don't trust myself.   So...are we clear?  And, as an act of good faith, you will notice that she now has a link on our blog!

      A recent stuggle to better understand myself has led to a lot of soul searching, which spawned this article. Can submission take you on a quest for self or better help you to understand your inner workings? Is submission a static force in life or is it constantly flucuating, like so many other things?   Every few years, when the seasons begin to change from warm and balmy to cooler and blustery, I become very internal and like to burn my entire world to the ground. Generally, I come back like a phoenix from the ashes, more self-aware and driven to pursue the goals that I can validate and explain. Sometimes this requires a massive change in my thinking (such as going from pro-life to pro-choice, just an example. I'm ardently pro-choice!), and sometimes it simply cements in my mind those activities and beliefs I'm attached to.  Whatever the reason, my quest for self this year has allowed me a unique perspective on submission. This is the first year of my life I've truly been able to embrace submission to the highest degree. I'm more involved now than I ever was, and I'm not afraid to admit to myself the reasons why.  Let's begin at the beginning. A quest for self is an ongoing, static element in day to day life, though one may not actually realize it to be happening. Everything a person does in life is a pin-point exact mechanism to further his or her own personal goal(s) - whether that be to fit in, forge a new path or choose to separate from their original belief system entirely.   Selfhood is in the largest lifestyle details and the smallest: religion, desire to have (or not have) a family and children, sexuality, hairstyle... If you can dream it, it relates to personal concept of self.  From first breath, certain details are decided for you. Sexuality is innate, religion is chosen at birth, certain physical characteristics you are born with (eye color, nose shape, height potential) and others aren't truly your own for many years to come (hairstyle, etc.).   The genetic mandate of quest for self hits hard around thirteen, when you're driven to "discover yourself" and rebel against the original plan set out for you by your caretakers. It's my personal belief that quest for self never truly ends, we're constantly reinventing ourselves in a better and more fitting image of what we believe is right, moral, correct, etc.  Now, how does this quest for self relate to submission? I believe that submission is both a choice and a necessity. I would absolutely agree that there are people who live this lifestyle (albeit for a short time generally) because it looks intriguing, is trendy, etc. They have no built in need to submit. Othes, and I dare say most, submissives submit because it's in their blood, their genetic makeup. His or her very DNA is screaming out this unwritten code, sometimes earlier than he or she can even hear or understand it. You either have this code, or you don't. It's not something you can fake or force (at least not for any extended period of time). The degrees vary, but the initial feelings and driving force is the same. Need to submit, need to surrender.  The question then becomes this: if life is a constant quest for self, how then can a person fully submit to someone else knowing things may change again tomorrow? The answer to this is simple. When done correctly, submission is key to calming your quest for self. Submission, at least for me, allows time out from the daily grind. It gives me time to switch into an alternate reality, to let down my guard and to take a peek at myself from the outside. Many of my problems have been solved in subspace, as it's a clear channel directly from your conscious to your subconscious mind.   Life is all about decisions, balancing the rational decisions that inhibit the negative, self-destructive innate qualities with positive, self-actualizing qualities. It's about taking that quest for self seriously, truly understanding yourself and your need for anything (religion, submission, choices you make on a day to day basis). Submission is a wonderful gift, an almost fool-proof way to search your soul (subspace reminds me a lot of the way I feel while meditating) and discover your core elements. I thank my lucky stars every day to be submissive. Who says we're weak?

      People often use the term "sadist" in a derogatory manner. But is when someone is perfectly frank about how much pleasure inflicting pain gives them... well, it doesn't really work as an insult. Mistress Matisse is a sadist.  And, personally, as a submissive, I wouldn't want to get within 100 miles of her. But, as a person, I think she's incredibly honest about herself. What is rarer still is that she is capable of telling you exactly what she gets out of the experience. It is an incredibly good read.   urlLink  The Pleasures of Topping    She also writes a blog which is sometimes hysterical and often quite insightful  urlLink Mistress Matisse

      I'm encountering a lot of assumptions about what "real" submissives will or won't do. One thing that has come up repeatedly is corporal punishment - read: pain. Don't all submissives like a good caning?   I think it's important to be up-front about where my preferences lie, so that you can read the rest of this with that in mind.   Personally, I like a bit of pain with my pleasure. I find that certain types of pain not only enhance the pleasure I'm feeling, but also translate into pleasure at certain times. This last qualifier is VERY important; slap me across the face in the livingroom, and I'll deck you. Basically, I don't LIKE pain. In fact, I hate pain. It's just that when I am aroused, I don't feel certain types of pain as pain anymore.  So, having gotten that bit of info out of the way...  Submission and pain are NOT synonymous. Many submissives don't get off on pain at all. It's not a part of their submissive make-up. Conversely, there are many people into strictly vanilla sex who DO get off on pain.  Yes, you can be submissive without being a masochist and you can be a masochist without being submissive. Perhaps it's just how your nerves are wired up.  Some submissives like "punishment" pain. But don't enjoy it if it intrudes on their "pleasure" phase. Personally, I hate and won't tolerate "punishment" pain at all. I only like it when it is accompanied by or very close to a pleasure experience.  For some submissives, the instrument of pain is important. It can symbolize the authority the Dom wields over you. They enjoy the act of submitting to the Dominant's authority (which might include a caning) far more than they like the actual sensation that might accompany it. Then, some people could care less what the context is...they just love how the pain makes them feel.  Here's what we know for sure:  When you feel pain, it releases endorphins into the bloodstream. This has, as it's basis the 'fight or flight' reaction. It also triggers a release of adrenaline. The adrenaline tends to sharpen your senses, cause shortness of breath, send your mind racing, and make you fight against bonds if you are tied. All these reactions can be overcome - but in a normal person - that's what they do. The adrenaline flood doesn't last that long. The endorphines that are released last quite a bit longer. They are natural opiates, causing you to feel euphoric and having a calming effect on the body. Sooner or later, they overtake the adrenaline... and you are left with a very pleasurable feeling.  But this, to some extent, depends on your body. The amount of adrenaline and endorphins you release on feeling pain, really varies a great deal from person to person. Also, some people have far more efficient pain receptors than others. And it may very greatly, depending on what part of the body is being "hurt".  How much pain you can take has got a lot less to do with your endurance and a lot more to do with your genetic make-up and your body's ability to produce the right amount of chemicals. So someone who doesn't get off at all on pain, might simply be more sensitive, or produce fewer endorphines.  It ain't a contest. If you aren't getting off on it - don't put up with it! I have actually heard a Dom, during a public scene say "Let's see how much this slut can take." It isn't a matter of what you can take! It's a matter of what you want! Fuck! The amount of pain a person can tollerate RARELY has anything to do with the amount that will get them off. Personally, I have a very high pain threshhold but the level of pain that makes me feel good is much, much lower.  There are other reasons why pain might be of some use during sexual activities. Certain people who have either been traumatized or who have very bad problems with sex-guilt have a tendency to "drift off" while they are having sex. Their bodies are there but their mind goes bye-bye. Pain (in moderation and with permission, of course) can be quite an effective way to "pin" a person's consciousness in their body so they stay "present" during the act. The endorphins calm them and make them feel comfortable about being "there". The adrenaline boosts their sensory perception.  There are people who become so addicted to the physiological responses their bodies produce on feeling pain, that they become, literally "pain sluts". They can be really disturbing to encounter because their enjoyment and tollerance seems unbelievable. They often will  beg  for physical damage. At this stage, someone responsible should probably step in and make them go "cold turkey" for a while. One or two months of no pain at all seems to effectively "reset" the mechanism - so much less pain will feel just as good.  Now, on the other side of the coin: some people get off on causing pain (yes, sadists) and this ranges from mild to simply psychotic. Sometimes, what get's people off is the power to cause the pain - sometimes, it's the actual physical evidence of the pain itself (i.e. people who get excited by seeing really red buttocks or welts). Then, there are people who are absolutely NOT sadists at all. They impose the pain because they get off on the recipient's enjoyment of it.  Finally, there are people who, no matter how much they can intellectually understand that pain feels good to you, simply  can't  accomodate you. Inflicting pain makes them physically ill or emotionally distraught even if you have convinced them that you want it, like it, crave it.   Attempting to bully someone into giving you pain is, in my books, just as disgusting as trying to bully someone into taking it. It is non-consensual and it oversteps the boundaries of what anyone should be able to ask another person to do for them.  Pain... Like it? Hate it? When and how?

      This post doesn't deal with anything D/s in particular. It's more about relationships in general. So, to be contraversial, I'm going to make a statement: I think that Harlequin Romances and any other type of bodice-buster romantic drivel should be BANNED, CENSORED, MADE ILLEGAL.   Well, actually, I don't believe in censorship at all. So I actually retract the previous statement. BUT. I do think that there is a certain type of film, novel, etc. that is very dangerous for people.  Why?  The concept of romantic love evolved in the middle-ages in response to the church's condemnation of physical love (other than for the purposes of procreating).  Romantic love - courtly love - was a way of swinging your adoration of god sideways and focusing it on some poor bucktoothed damsel. If you admired her, worshipped the ground she walked on, likened her in purity to the virgin mary and obsessed about her - this was fine. As long as you didn't dream of getting up her skirt.  Of course, like all bad ideas, it mutated and multiplied.  What we are left with today, in the Western world, is an ideal of love that is at once infantile and abstract. Real love - true love... is portrayed to us as being primarily non-physical. Your lover should be your best friend, your intellectual equal, your partner in domestic bliss, your companion in sickness and in health, your kindest critic, your most ardent supporter, the most caring parent to your children, and the most responsible of bankers. Oh, and the best fuck you have ever had in your life, year after year after year.  This ideal, this uber-lover, is the stuff of fiction. And not even good fiction. At the end of the story, after the misunderstandings, the missed tristes, the descent into and recovery from some predictable illness or another, the hero of the story emerges as this.  Now, add on a little "new-age-guy-ness/gal-ness" and we also have a man who will gleefully do the dishes or the female new-media executive who kicks boardroom ass!  No one can be this...NO ONE.   But the media have, for the most part, succeeded in making us believe that this is what we should have. And if we don't have it, we'd better drop the loser we do have, get on our bikes and go get it!  So, no matter how well-suited you are to your partner, no matter how much you try to battle the images being thrown at you by the media, every so often, we all emit a little shuddering sigh and dream of that uber-lover. Oh, the subterranean discontent!  Now... added on to the list of should-be's, submissives want more. They want a partner who will be ALL THAT, and shed at least half of it upon entering the bedroom to emerge as the DOMINATOR. Oh...it's amazing they don't go crazy.  When sitting down over a drink, patiently listening to a friend's complaints about the gaping holes in their current loves personality, I am often heard to mutter... well, you can always get that somewhere else.  GASP.   Am I condoning unfaithfulness? Well, in a sense, yes. I am. Not necessarily sexual infidelity, but more a general belief that you shouldn't look for everything you want in one person. It's hideously unfair to them, and dissatisfying for you.  Oh, and get rid of those fucking romantic novels - they'll only make you miserable.

      Gosh, I've missed you all. I've not even been able to read for pleasure for about 2 weeks now, much less write. Crazy busy is the notion that best describes it.   The One and I have been playing house at the end of summer with big hopes and plans and I'm looking at a substantial promotion at work. I just had a few moments to try to catch up this morning and wanted to let you know I hadn't dropped off the face of the earth... just down into a deep hole for a while. I hope you are all wall and getting what you need. I'll be a more regular participant after school starts again, at least that 's the plan. Hugs. ama

      First, I thought I would share one of my very favorite poems on an S&M theme:   "...Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt you? Men touch them, and change in a trice The lilies and languors of virtue For the raptures and roses of vice; Those lie where thy foot on the floor is, These crown and caress thee and chain, O splendid and sterile Dolores, Our Lady of Pain..."   An excerpt of   Dolores (Notre-Dame de Sept Douleurs)   AC Swinburne the full poem is   urlLink here   and very beautiful  And some other interesting links for your perusal...    Rose  has written a very excellent summary of "percussion" tools, their uses and their effects. She's the second person I've read that seems to love floggers and her reasons are extremely well written:  urlLink  Percussion Toys     Aspirant  has written an interesting essay on the topic of  urlLink  punishment     This is a rather strange article by  Gawain  on  urlLink  The Metaphysics of Spanking .  She/he discusses self-flagellation (a little confusing) and there are instructions on how to make your own tools!  For anyone who hasn't tried spanking or has a partner who is a little reticent to do it,  Saxon  has a very good article,  urlLink  a beginners Guide  .  Sexuality.org  has a more in-depth but drier  urlLink  How To Guide  . Finally there is a very good, but old article by  Jay Wiseman :  urlLink  A Good Spanking .   For those of you who like "legitimate" publications, I found a very good article on the Psychology Today site:  urlLink  THE PLEASURE OF THE PAIN: Why Some People Need S&M  . It's informative, well referenced, but they seem to have the same problem with confusing S&amp;M with D/s that a lot of "vanilla" people have.  Finally, I have found a really erudite article on the Wellcome Trust site in the UK:  urlLink  Pain and the Erotic ,  by Lesley Hall  I'm fresh out of things to blog about - so today, it's just links.  rg

       urlLink      Fay Wray was the actress who played the lead in the 1933 film classic King Kong.            When I first heard about Fay Wray's death this morning, I thought...well, she was 96 and she's had a long and interesting life. But the BBC story reporting her death included some interesting facts. Her career effectively came to a halt after the success of King Kong. Typecast for life, she was trapped forever in the clutches of the monster.   There is a metaphor here, for me. An important one. And I'm going to have to go back in time to explain it a little.  I think my very first identifiable "submissive" feeling came from watching King Kong. I was about 9, we were living in Spain, and it was a big deal that they were showing it on TV and a bigger deal that my parents let me stay up to watch it.  The image of her tied to the sacrificial posts, screaming her fucking head off, as the gargantuan (although quite kindly looking) beast took her into his rough, beastie-like hands... sent ripples of pleasure down my spine and buried them between my legs. I actually flushed bright red and retreated further from the TV viewing area, nested under the legs of my mother's grand piano, and continued to watch from a distance and in a modicum of privacy.  Oh, I wanted so badly to be that girl.  And all these years later, I still get little twinges, remembering the part where he has her nested comfortably in the staw in his cave; she watches him take a fluttering piece of her demure attire and holds it up to his nose, smelling her scent on it.  ::sigh::   (did they actually KNOW what they were doing when they made that film?)    Honestly, I don't know if watching King Kong at the age of nine  made  me a submsissive for life but it certainly contributed to it. Of that I'm sure.  No matter how much I try to bring my adult nature into the submissive equasion. No matter how much I kick against the trappings of the infantilism I see so prevalent amongst submissives in the D/s world,I still feel like, somehow, I am reverting to "little girlness" to be there. And perhaps that is why, in recent years, I have actually physically removed myself from an environment in which it is possible to have a D/s relationship.  Rose said something very interesting in a comment back to me on one of the previous posts. She said it wasn't about age; it was about vulnerability. But I'm having a hard time separating the two.  Does a "good girl" ever grow up to become a "good woman" or are we trapped forever as little girls in the clutches of the monster?

      Well, this is definitely an interesting topic! Before P and I went any deeper than surface level into our BDSM relationship, we talked a lot about everything associated with it.   In the beginning, pain scared the hell out of me. I was terrified of it, I feared it. I wanted to be submissive but, from what I knew before studying theory, I assumed that meant I had to be into pain and that I had to want to get beaten on a fairly regular basis. This not being true, I approached P and we've had MANY discussions related to this topic.  I'm not a pain slut. I'm growing to love spankings, but that's truly the extent of things. I've come to realize lately that I have a bit of a Daddy issue (even more than I thought), so being punished for "misbehaving" would have to be handled very delicately. Then again, perhaps part of the reason I'm behaving well in the first place is to please him (instead of fear of being reprimanded).   P and I have never really gone to a punishment level with my submission. It's been said time and again that if he asks me to do something and I neglect it, or challenge it, there will be punishments. Generally, though, it will be some sort of sexual punishment - withholding of orgasm and that sort of thing.  That said, he has spanked me before. The problem there is that I'm beginning to like it, which means it's not so much a "punishment" anymore. I'm a tough nut to crack though, so I'm not sure there could be an appropriate punishment for me. *shrug* Anyway, that's my take on it.   Punishment for punishment's sake, like Devi said, is an entirely different beast. A Dom who is overly sadistic, however, won't have a sub who isn't into pain for too long or will end up with a overly masochistic submissive. Either way, everything works out in the end.

      Okay, so here's my post.  :P  When I was with Sir, even before I went out to visit, he made it  very clear  that I wouldn't need to misbehave to get flogged.   As a matter of fact, he specifically told me, "I don't want you to misbehave.  I'll help you find subspace and it won't be punishment ... it'll be playing.  Punishment is different, and you won't like it."  After that, I mentioned something about chewing up his socks ... but I digress.  I liked that idea.  I liked the way of thinking he had.  Even  before  I had much to do with BDSM, the thought of being a 'bad puppy' was not a thrilling one to me.  My psyche is such that that's probably the worst sort of punishment that someone can inflict on me; when I'm subbed out, I thrive on making people happy.  The one time I challenged him was interesting, though.  He'd told me to do something, and I just sort of looked up at him and smirked.  He didn't realize for a few moments that it was a challenge, but when he  did  ... the physical punishment was swift, harsh, and intense.  It caught me off guard, and of course it felt horrible.  Nothing like "playing."  But, in a way, it also put me in my place and reminded me who was the Dom and who was the puppy.  I  thanked  him for it afterward.  Partially because he let me know that it didn't mean that I was horrible, and partially because he was paying enough attention to my actions to recognize that I was challenging him in the first place.  And, for the record, I challenged him  just to see if he was paying attention .  In talking to and interacting with a lot of Doms since then, I was extremely surprised at the amount of them that actually expect me to misbehave, just so they can have an excuse to flog me.  Really, they don't need that.  I  like  flogging/pain (to a certain degree), when it's done right.  I've tried to explain that to them, and I've also tried to explain that I don't like misbehaving, but they don't seem to grasp that little concept.  Recently, after a bit of play with a "Dom", I was accused of being  too submissive .  He didn't say it in so many words, but that's the general meaning I caught from what he told me.  WTF?  Is there such a thing?  And if there is, is it  bad ?  Needless to say, I didn't feel so kosher after being told that, and doubt I'll ever, EVER play with him again.  I have no idea if this makes any sense whatsoever, but there you have it.  Now I'm feeling all nostalgic.

      Aha...gotcha! Actually, it was a comment from the last post that got me thinking about this. Pretend punishments...   My very first Dom - shortlived - loved to spank. Problem was, he really needed an excuse to do it. It got a tad silly.   He'd look at me and say..."Have you been a good girl?" (Ok. That was my cue.)  "Oh, no Sir... I've been incredibly naughty!" I'd say, looking seriously ashamed of myself.  The spanking/stapping/whipping would inevitably ensue. He loved it, I loved it. But WHY, OH WHY did we always have to go through this crap first???? Why is it that he never could admit that he just liked doing it?  I get off on a pain (within reason). I get on even more on the fact that the person delivering is is enjoying it, or the effects, or the sounds, whatever.   My last Dom was much better. He's just give me that incredibly sexy look and say, "Mmmm, come here and let me tan that hide." I really appreciate that. He liked it, I liked it. Everyone was happy and no one felt they needed to make up excuses for what they wanted.  *sigh*  Or am I missing something....?  If you have an opinion on this one PLEASE WRITE A POST!!!

      Ah, chatting with Rose does me no end of good. It was during this chat that this particular subject came up. Corporal punishment for the purposes of behaviour correction.   Having had rather "untraditional" D/s relationships, the first time I heard of someone being caned for "corrective" purposes, I really had a bad reaction to it. The case in question was one where the submissive had been bad-tempered and rude. The solution was a caning. Both the submissive and the Dominant agreed.  I have to be honest and say that it was hard for be even to get my head around this intellectually. Because to me, it inferred an infantalization of the submissive that I found very hard to take. We have two consenting adults here, both are fully formed grown-ups. Submissives are not the only ones who have hissy fits. When a Dom has one, who corrects the Dom?   My inability to get my head around this is one of the major reasons for not indulging in a 24/7 relationship. Everyone throws a fit now and then and I believe everyone has the right to - plus, sometimes, they are warranted! No one can be perfectly even-tempered all the time...nor is it healthy to do it. The suppression of legitimate anger is neither psychologically nor physically healthy.   Certainly, there are better and worse ways to let off steam. Taking it out on the person you love most is not the best way to do it. But what I notice in a lot of "behaviour correction" situations, is that the sub is not getting any direction on how to channel that anger somewhere safe, less harmful to the relationship or useful. They're just getting punished for showing it at all. And this worries me - for the mental health of the people involved.   I have a bad temper. I get angry - sometimes for very good reasons. I have, over time, learned to channel it away from people I care about by removing myself from their presence or saying: "Look, I am in an awful mood right now, please give me about half-an-hour, and I will be fine." And thirty minutes later, I AM fine. I've dealt with it properly, and I'm ready to be socially acceptable again.  As I said earlier, I have never had a 24/7 D/s relationship. And this has allowed me to put myself in the right headspace, get rid of all my shit, and turn up for my Dom in a mindset that will be good for both of us.  I can SEE the attraction, the comfort, the totality of being in a 24/7 D/s relationship. And now I can even, if only theoretically, see the point of this type of behavioral correction. I just don't think I could do it without having my personality disappear.  So...what do  you think? Do you? Don't you?
