Some define good life as having lots of money and possessions. I am a firm believer of love; I believe that the purpose of life should be learning how to love. There are several stages of love in which love develops. I believe all human love is self-love. Now hold on, don’t stop reading because I said something that we all know but don’t want to admit simply because we don’t want to be called selfish. It’s not selfish, it’s the reality but we don’t see it because we are afraid of being labeled as selfish. I will explain you according to my knowledge and understanding and then you be the judge and decide if I have any grain of truth in it. This is the knowledge I have from my experiences, learning, reading, and listening to motivational speakers. This includes psychology, philosophy, and personal experiences.  We go through stages in which we refine our sense of selfhood; once we pass these stages we expand our sense of selfhood. Since Greeks have history of all those great philosophers who advocated love, and meaning of life thus I will use Greek letters to represent these stages. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. You might find some of these characteristics in your personality but please don’t label yourself without going through all this reading. Every one of us exhibits combination of characteristics in personality. Don’t get ahead yourself, please bare with me. These are the perspectives from which we view our lives.  I am going to refer women perspective as an example you are free to substitute your gender. First perspective is Alpha perspective. An alpha person loves herself. Her security needs dictate her sense of selfhood. She reduces her personhood to her search for security. She feels secure associating herself with other people, especially family of some type. Her claim of love for her family is strictly her need of security. She needs family to make her feel secure. Family fulfills her needs thus she claims that she loves them. Finally she does not question the belief system of the person or group she has attached herself.  I experienced Pakistani culture before American culture so my examples might show my personal opinions and experiences you don’t have to agree with me on them but I’m trying to explain what I said above. When we are born as an infant and as a child we feel helpless insecure. We realize that we are inexperienced, weak, and small person in the world of these huge and strong adults. We are vulnerable and to protect ourselves we attach ourselves to our families. Our families provide all our physical and emotional needs and protects us from harm. This is our security blanket and as a part of this security blanket there are religious and social beliefs that we accept mainly without questioning them. Since we do not know any better at this age and have no control over events so we follow our adults.  Pakistani girl usually get married as soon as she become the age, best case scenario she get to finish education and then get married to some one who either her parents chose or she likes. Now she is in her husband house, who is in many respects is another caretaker just like she had before (her father). Just like her father now her husband takes care of her protect her provide all her security needs. He gives her all his religious, political, and social beliefs in return of this security blanket. He even gives her name, his last name just like her parents gave her. She changed nuclear family units, but she remained an Alpha personality.  Pakistani men in some respect are Alpha persons too. I’m just giving example of those who demonstrate these traits. Guys too are motivated by a need for security. They too move directly from their parent’s house to the house with their wives. She now fulfill many of the functions his mother use to fulfill. She cooks, clean, arrange his social life, and purchase his clothes for him. He continues to follow the value system given by his parents. Some of the Alpha personalities attach themselves to an organization instead of a person or nuclear family. Religious organizations, political groups, social organizations such as fraternities and sororities are especially attractive to them. These organizations give their members a system with values, a sense of belonging, and an identity. The use of words like "Brother" and "Sister" by these organizations shows their attempt to replace the original family unit their members have left.  Alpha person tends to associate herself closely with other people, she claims that she loves them but her love is self-love. The motivation behind this love is the security need. Alpha personality can also be summarized by the phrase "I NEED." Many Alpha people refuse to admit the motivation behind their behavior. We can only see this clearly if we were to concentrate on our emotions. The human mind is capable of lying to itself but the emotions never lie. Loneliness, fear of rejection, identity crises, feelings of inferiority, and other security related emotions indicate that she is an Alpha personality and her needs for securities are not met. For an Alpha person to be happy, she has to only associate herself a person or group and assume the values of that person.   My first love is my mother, she happens to be an Alpha person. My father was an Alpha person too. My father fulfilled her security needs and she fulfilled his security needs. They both were fulfilled Alpha people. When my father died, she got real sick her entire world turned upside down, she felt insecure again. Nothing in the world could make her feel secure until she found a religious organization. The organization gave her sense of security all over again. This organization gave her extensive system of values, a sense of belonging, and an identity, which she felt she has lost after my father’s death.  I identified myself with Alpha personality while I was child. At the age of ten I knew that I’m not an Alpha person. I didn’t want to associate myself with any organization, team, or any social group. My mother enrolled me to an independent Boy Scout organization supported by the company my father worked in. She tried to force the system of values she had. I liked this organization since it gave me time away from my family and with variety of different kids. I accepted her value system but not entirely. I enjoyed the travel part of being in that organization. My motivation was purely to meet new people and go around the world. I worked hard to gain my leadership positions only for this reason, my motivations were never security; I didn’t associate myself to this organization for the reasons of security. As much as my parents were protective about me, I shouldn’t be the way I’m now. I struggled real hard to get this freedom. More I stayed away from home, more my self hood gained strength. I will relate myself to the personalities I feel associated with later in these journals.  The advantages of Alpha personality include the fact that happiness is rather easy to achieve. For an alpha person to be happy they only have to associate themselves with a person or group and assume the values of that person or group. Second advantage of being alpha person is the fact that majority of the world’s population are Alpha people, it’s easy to fit with most groups. Disadvantages would be the attitude to accept the belief system without questioning. Extreme emotional trauma when experiencing unfulfilled. We do not purely exist in any one of these stages, in fact we some time exist in several. There is always one predominant perspective from which we view reality. Why do we need to identify this predominant stage? Simply for the reason of our growth to higher stages.  We need to know where we came from and where we are at present in order to plan for our future growth. The essential need for this growth from one stage to another is humility. If we have the humility to admit that we exist at one of the lower stages of development, progress to the higher stage is possible. If we falsely make ourselves believe that we already exist at higher stage then two things could happen. One we might not want to grow to higher stage, second we might attempt to develop to the stage, which is beyond our reach since skipping a stage is nearly impossible.  I will add our religion to the context of this theory. We as Muslims humiliate ourselves in the presence of Allah in every prayer by kneeling down. We put our forehead, noses to ground showing our inferiority to the greatest power of universe. The growth begins from our sincerity in our prayers. The more humble we get in our prayer, more development we feel. The great Muslim Philosophers and saint were the most humble people on the earth. They never demonstrated any signs of arrogance or gained any self-benefits from their knowledge or fame.What motivates us to grow is a sense of discomfort with the current stage we are in. Each stage brings a certain type of pain with it, which drive us to a higher stage. Nature has its own timing and order for such things. If one never feel this discomfort and spend his/her entire lifetime, I believe there is nothing wrong with that. After all the purpose of life is to be happy and if one is happy in a certain stage then we are no one to tell them to be unhappy.     Part II -- Beta Perspective (I WANT)   At the age of 21, I began to wonder about my life. I realized that everything that I had, and every thing I was, was given to me by other people. My father provided me financial security till he died. My mother made sure that I have my clothes, shoes, and stuff ready when I needed it, she cooked food for me and I never had to pick up after me, finally she married me to girl of her choice. My wife gave me another identity husband. My kids gave me identity as father. My values were given by my parents. I came to believe that I achieved a little or nothing on my own. I became overwhelmed by a sense of shame concerning lack of personal achievements. This was the time when I entered in unfulfilled stage of Beta perspective. I felt the absence of something in my personality. I began to believe that a sense of personal achievement is an inherent human need. These feelings, combined with the feelings of moving on beyond my concerns with security entered me in to the Beta perspective.  In my early stage of Beta personality, I felt the need to rebel against the sources of the security I have experienced as Alpha person. I experienced great deal of anger, I left the security of marriage, did everything which was forbidden. I was involved in marathon sex after my divorce. Soon enough I realized no need to angrily rebel. The feelings of shame took over me and motivated by a sense of shame, I decided to finish my education on my own. I held two jobs and finished school with those jobs. I was finished with my bachelor and started working for a university system by year 2000. This is my second stage of Beta personality where I am trying to achieve things on my own with all the responsibilities involved. I have almost three jobs, taking care of my kids, going to school, and work full time. My desire for personal achievements keeps me going, I experience a sense of pride for my achievements. Pride is the dominant emotion of the fulfilled Beta personality.  Beta people are driven to excel, their achievements might rest in any field. The disadvantage of Beta perspective consists in the compulsive nature of the need to excel. Beta person cannot be happy unless he is constantly achieving something. The degree of his achievement is judged by other people. Therefore, what he is really seeking is recognition from others. This leaves him dependent on other people. He chooses his identity, although his appraisal of the success of this identity is dependent upon others approval.  Society and Beta Perspective: Society has traditionally reserved the Beta life style of worldly achievement for men only. Women have traditionally been conditioned into accepting the Alpha role of wife and homemaker. I believe that women are better candidates to accept the rigors of a Beta life style than are men. Medical evidence indicates that women are better equipped than men to endure stress. Thus they are more qualified to join in the competitive life of the Beta person. The central problem facing housewives is the problem of an identity crisis, a feeling that they are nothing but extensions of their husbands and children. A carrier gives them an independent identity. It gives their lives a sense of meaning and purpose.

       I associate myself with mercury simply because it's the only metal which is found in the liquid form. Its metal and metals are associated with solids. Why am I saying this? I'm a man and a popular belief is that we (men) are incapable of being soft, we can't be nurturing this quality is only associated with women. Men are mostly associated with solid metals such as steal, rock, mountains, etc and women are associated with softness, flowers, pure drop of water etc. I have to come out of closet and admit against the popular belief that being a man I'm loving and nurturing. I'm MERCURY!!! Do you understand now what I am talking about? Why I associate myself with mercury?  My emotions run wild just like mercury. It rises on a hot contact in a glass tube. If it gets hot I go high, if it gets cold I go low, down, shrink...  The hotter it gets, higher I go and there come a point I cant go any higher, I'm a prisoner in the tube and I feel like I’m gonna burst out of it. Once I’m out of the tube no one can hold me. I will spread like mercury in tiny pieces, every piece of mine will be complete in shape but it wouldn’t be the same.  You can put it together and bring the old shape back but there are so many pieces of mine to put together, it will take too long and it’s so hard to find my little pieces that are lost. Would anyone care to find those pieces and put me into shape I was? Every time I’m dropped I changed my shape, I collected myself together like mercury but some pieces of mine are lost, I can’t be the same. I’m dropped over and over and over. More I get dropped smaller I get, if I kept getting dropped I will lose my existence, may be some where my tiny pieces would exist but it wouldn’t be my shape, I’m gonna lose my shape.  Can some one stop this heat?Can some one cool it down?Can some one make sure I stay in tube? May be this time if I’m dropped I may or may not stay the same shape. I always come down on a little breeze of kindness, I always rise on a little warmth of emotions, I always take the shape of my container, I hug every corner of this container, I fill it completely every corner of it, every inch of it unlike rocks. I’m the mercury and I don’t discriminate shapes, but my container has to be my size or bigger. Not too big that I disappear and not too small that I spill over and lose some parts of me. Just big enough to hold me. It neither let me spill nore let me disappear.  I’m done for today, I have expressed myself, now I’m back to the battle of temperature...

       I have never felt such loneliness I cry and beat the bathroom floor There is no one here that understands me anymore I'm afraid of losing you  You can't look away I'm already there You can't look away You can't look away I am the one you put down I am the one right here You can't look away I'm already There...  There is no one here but loneliness I'm afraid to be alone Sometimes it feels like I'm clinging to an edge that knows I'm afraid to carry on Carry on Carry on  You can't look away I'm already there You can't look away You can't look away I am the one you put down I am the one right here You can't look away I'm already I'm already  You can't look away I'm already there You can't look away I'm not there  You can't look away I'm already there You can't look away You can't look away I am the one you put down I am the one right here You can't look away I'm already I'm already I'm already There...
