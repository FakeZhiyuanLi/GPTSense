      ...or whatever.  Life seems to pose the maximum amt of work just when u least want it... ...or perhaps we want the least whenever we get the maximum.. not quite sure of that,but whatever it may be,it's not very good.  I had finished matrices sort of yesterday but didnt do anything much after that!...and today when i am doing the miscellaneous problems,i realize that the properties of determinants are giving me some little problem...which ofcourse i will be sorting out just now.  I have just come back from the wall,after some exhausting(not literally,but whatever) tennis.I even cut my finger badly due to my metallic watch on my left hand while playing a double-hand backhand...But that's the fun about tennis...i love playing all the more when it's paining somewhere...it gives u some extra zeal.  Today,as usual was quite a sultry hot and humid day,in this great land of delhi belonging to this "great" nation INDIA.  I think there is also a indo-pak cricket match on today....not that i am interested,but i heard some score while coming back from the wall.(some noise was coming from KLS)  Also,my search for P-A hasn't led to any conclusions(simply because i have hardly searched!!!).  So i think i should go for a nice bath and then back to matrices!! AND BEST OF LUCK (to myself).  CHA_CHao. (bleh!)

      Ya....saw that movie today after coming back from school.And since i didnt blog yesterday,it should be mentioned that i saw "the terminal" yesterday. I dont know why i am wasting so much of my time...  Anyway,quite a lot of activity in the past 1/2 days.....or atleast i feel so.  Today in the PE period i escaped the fate of something evil by telling the REP when she had come from inspection...that i had come to take  a medicine.  HA!  Anyway,came back and DID NOT have lunch....but had bhel-puri in the evning.  Today,my right foot was bleeding but i still went on playing tennis for the time i was playing it.....there are somethjings in life that u wouldn't mind doing...even when u r in the most excruciating pains....  Anyway,i have hardly studied today...a fact which i hope to change in the nxt few hours....but befor e that i must get prachi's chem notebook photostated for the friday i had missed....and then should do some matrices and determinants.  bleh!

      Ha!..ya...tomorrow is english m.t....and i haven't even studied a single chapter!! Have been sitting in front of the book the whole day...doing anything and everything except the syllabus chapters!  Anyway,We had planned to go to PVR Saket,(me,saurabh and ilaksh)...and we were almost going when maasi had this WONDERFUL idea and called up at the last moment that its not safe coz of AUG 15(duh!!)...bleh  So i got really pissed off.... i didn't even watch yesterday's hungarian GP....  bleh!  And so it happenned that when i had decided to get a movie for rent,then Dad came up with the wonderful idea that we should go to the garden of 5 senses.Bleh!...i mean everything was happenning me against the movies.  Anyway,so we went to the garden of 5 sense,with myself being double pissed off.....fine place but nothing tooo great!  Anyway,so came back and had idli vadas which maasi had sent on the previous day..  And then i tried to study some english but went off to sleep.! So that was it... Bleh and chao!

      Hullo all!  ANOTHER passing day... slept quite late last night...got up and 10:30 in the morning. Today was the 35th convocation of IIT DELHI!!! /...bleh...(u think i am intersested???)  Anyway,did some matrices and determinants....and wasted a lot of time but not knowing how.....actually,i did NOT waste a lot of time...i just feel that i did.,...i don't know....there i go babbling again!  So....Saurabh had called over some friends (Sirat and i think some nirmalya(?) )  for lunch or some thing.... (bleh!)  so...actually nothing.  As a reader,you must be quite aquainted with my current state of mind by the usage of repetative unintersesting speech words and topics... BLEH!  Anyway,went to maasi's in the evening....And ya...before i forget.....played a li'l tennis outside the house itself....after a LOOONG LOOONG TIME!!... And again the cable-man came asking for the money and AGAIN i argued for a better reception and again he went away disappointed!  Ya...where was i?ya....went to maasi's in the evening.Kannu came back with us. AND had another torrid car journey!(i am not sure if that's the rigt word as i dont even know its exact meaning momentarily and dont even care coz of an exasperated state of a relatively entropic mind!!  Anyway, came back and trhen made a li'l of my physics practical file! BLEH! And another BLEH!!

      Actually not.  TOOK OFF from school today!!!  ...And studied matrices and determinants at home...(but only did 2 exercises the whole day!!:(  Anyway,watched dune fully for the 1st time...(not very bad a movie)  AND Guess what!!....the memory spree continues....today i remembered a LOT of old stuff....1 of them being a comment made by showmik dutta a few years back in the school bus..."You know,yesterday night i pointed a torch at a plane above the house,and the beam of the torch actually struck the plane's body visibly!!"....duhhh....or lol perhaps. not even very funny...i mean c'mon...what did he even think??i mean ,yes,planes are quite low above our houses...but not THAT low....i mean still a couple of thousand feets.!!  Its 1 AM of saturday already...so i must sleep for some time.!! today i have recorded some 3:40 hours of classical music from winamp's radio with total recorder..!!...lol!! anyway, CHAO!!

      Hullo All!  hmmm...don't know where to start!...has been a looong day today!  came back from school,only to find mom and bhai to nani's house.finshed magnetic effects of current and did not do much after that.(except the numericals which i am doing now!!).  Ordered 2 excellently deliscious pizzas from slice of italy.!:) But somehow the day seems to be very gloomy.There seems to be a strange pang...of anxiety(?)?  Somehow , now as the days go counting by,the pressure is slowly creeping over.CBSE,SAT(to give or not to give!!),DCE,IIT(yeah sure!!!). Dunno how it'll end...but i do know that i have to work....and work & work.  Got reminded of an old fello-student today....(u know whom)!!!  but am a little worried...haven't heard from ms for a lot of time.Wonder whats up...?  Guess i must return to "Numerical Problems In PHYSICS"....(quite unintriguing)!  I mean,i don't think we should be taught anything else except things which NEED to be pondered upon...like SPECIAL relativity.But this year's physics isn't bad....have to start magnetism by tomorrow.  And also there's talk of going over to maasi's on saturday to pick up Ilaksh.  ALSO have to watch a movie with saurabh this weekend(coz this weekend is possibly the only one i can....guessed why??...c'mon...english M.T.!!!)  Chalo,physics numericals now....  Chao/Sayonara/Gutten nacht...!

      i had recently read J.P. Gott's "time travel in einstein's universe"..(didn't read it completely but atleast a little part)....and there was this thing that 99.999967% of speed of light has been attained in fermilab.I am quite sure the barrier's going to be broken sooner or later. Have to go for dinner now..:Kamal-kakri-aloo with some Dal.:( c ya...

      Things are happenning just a li'l tooo quickly.(Not being sarcastic about Mr. Bhargava's teaching!!.)  Tooo much work man....Integration,for which i literally have to diffrentiate my brain w.r.t. x. Then physics...chapter after chapter getting over in class.  And to add to the hulaabaloo....First my decision to give SAT and then my decision to overcome the apprised decision.  Now seems like if at all i give,it would be the new SAT launching spring of nxt year.  AND OFCOURSE...how can i forget computers?I/O classes flying above the head at the speed of light relative to the frame of my moment's reference.  And here's the irony....even after all that,i still have the audacity to waste my time here,blogging away to glory.  Had a nice day today,atleast till now.Tushar got frustrated to the skin with my talk with prateek on Einstein's SPECIAL Relativity theory.  But i mUST return to the books... Have a nice day....(if u r lucky enough...which not many ppl. are after reading my blog!!)

      The God DOES Save people ,,...u know?  I saw the proof yesterday....Vinci has taken 2 WHOLE DAYS OFF!!!!  What can be better?Ofcourse , it would have been an icing on the cake if romi sharma also followed suit...  But anyway,one should be content with oneself,and that is my present state of the mind,atleast momentarily....  Don't know what else to write right now... so .....
