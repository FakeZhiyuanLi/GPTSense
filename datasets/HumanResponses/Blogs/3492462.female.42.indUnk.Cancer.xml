      Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.  I hope you'll drop in occasionally.

      They say when it rains it pours and boy are they right.  Things that have happend to me this month-- graduation, birthday, mother's day, breakdown of both vehicles at the worst possible time, frustrating treading of water re the fixing of the lawnmower, which means my grass is waist high now.  Then He Who Is Mine went and tore his bicep off the bone-- surgery to reattach it was just Thursday.  Now he's on a forced three month medical leave, crippled up and unable to do anything with his arm in a splint, *and* because his injury happened at home, he's not eligible for light duty at work, therefore he's out of luck on the paycheck department.  So.  I've put in my app in several places the last few days and told the boss to expect a phone call or three but please don't think I'm leaving (are you kidding? This job is manna from heaven).  I also spent the day (and half the night) futzing around with an old computer trying to get it ready so my MIL can use it at work. In the process, I have made it so that DH's compter... the one with EQ installed mind you... won't even boot.  I will have to spend a week futzing around with that one too to figure out why.  Plus I got a virus during all this nonsense.     I am bushed already, and I've got three months to go.  I just wish a magic genie would come clean my house and yard.
