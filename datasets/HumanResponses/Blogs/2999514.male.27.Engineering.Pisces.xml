           &nbsp;       [detail]         I was executing the line pattern for this one in AutoCAD, got a strange feeling, turned it upside-down and thought to myself, "I think this one is done", because it had turned out looking like a skull.  I ported it into Coreldraw and colored it appropriately.  Looking at the last date the file was modified, it is interesting to note that I finished this one about a month before September 11th.

                    [detail]           Branching pattern with closing ends; the resulting polygons are "onionized" and colored adjacently according to an arbitrary spectrum. It ends up looking very maritime indeed.    Pattern drawn in AutoCAD, printed and colored with felt-tip marker.

                       This one has the name it does because it was the first work of mine where I completely used my computer to draw the lines.  The lines were done in AutoCAD, then it was printed out and colored with felt-tip marker.

          One day I finally thought to put dates on my sketch pages, and this is one of the images on the page dated December 1st.  It's one of a large series of sketches in which the design is determined by a genetic code based on the letters of a word.  In this case, this pattern is based on the short version of my first name.  It was done with pencil on Engineering graph paper.

      I'm about to 'port over all my old works to this blog from the old version of this site, but I won't be able to vouch for the exact dates that any of them were made for the most part, just so you know.  The best I will be able to do is date them according to when they were scanned in.  Blogger's posting options don't go much farther back than that anyway.  So if you'd like to see the oldies but goodies, just visit the "attic", below and to your right.
