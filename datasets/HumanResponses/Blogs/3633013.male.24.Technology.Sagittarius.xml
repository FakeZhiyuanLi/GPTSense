       alas, poor yorick!   i am still not sure why i joined this monstrosity, the blogger. i wonder if the creator of this doomsday instrument ever could predict the vast number of addicts that this device has now... horrible, horrible creation. and yet, genial.   i knew him, horatio - a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.   the world will end. sooner or later. no, seriously, it will end and we will all realize the failure of our own experiment. i dont think it will be all-powerful fella (who some refer to as "God"), or asteroid or global warming that will destroy this planet. eventually, someone will create a big bomb enough to vaporize half of the earth, and some other fella will come in, not believe the power of the bomb, and activate it. as my favourite writer, Terry Pratchett says: " If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying ' End-of-the World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ,' the paint wouldn't even have time to dry .   he hath bore me on his back a thousand times, and how now abhorred in my imagination it is.   well, thats all folks for now.
