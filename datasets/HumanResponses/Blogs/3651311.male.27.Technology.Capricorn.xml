						   i made it to 5:15am on sunday morning after a "summer" party - alcohol cannot kill me, or at least short term it couldn't ... great fun thanks to the guys and Hege ;)  not much happening today, sitting in the country again working a smidgen more than one usually does, but working none the less.   watched denmark make total arses of themselves in football last night.  jeez how can a team play that lazily and only lose 3-0. thanks czech republic for not making it a total laugh...

						   England got kicked out of the European Championship last night, by the host nation Portugal. A brilliant game, but the outcome was somewhat disappointing. I am not a football-freak, or any kind of sport-freak, but I do get quite excited when there are big tournaments like this, and I do have my favorites amongst the teams. England is one of them... And since this was last night, I guess I can't quite call it a bad start of the weekend, but things aren't looking good today either. Copenhagen it showing itself from the worst side at the moment with rain, wind, grey skies, some more rain and a lousy 11 degrees. And according to the forecast it is not getting any better anytime soon... The plans for the weekend suits the weather: house cleaning! This is one of the things that get ignored over and over again where I live. Not that we are sloppy people, it is just one of those things you should do but is so easy to replace with other, more interesting things. Right now I am searching very hard for the positive me I know is living somewhere inside. So far this Friday has been quite crappy... I will blame it mostly on the weather, but also a little bit on David Beckham. Why did you miss that first penalty kick??  Weekends, those wonderful two days you can spend doing absolutely nothing, absolutely everything or something completely different. I think house cleaning might be ignored yet again this weekend...

						   on the train out of the city this morning, i was witness to the following...  ticket inspector: morning, can i see your ticket please danish woman: yes [holds out ticket] ti: you should have clipped this at the station dw: why, i never have before ti: this is that type of ticket dw: that's rediculous, why do i have to clip ti: it validates the ticket, as you can see on the back, that's how it works dw: well i didn't know ti: that's ok, just hop off at the next station and clip it dw: can't you clip it here on the train ti: no it has to be done in one of the machines at the station dw: but i have to get off the train, i will miss it ti: no i will make sure the train waits for you dw: no, this is stupid, then i want a new ticket ti: no problem, you can then get the original unclipped ticket refunded at the station dw: [holds out credit card] ti: oh, you will have to come with me to the cc machine in the other end of the train dw: well fine then ti: but you will have to wait until after the next station as i have to work the doors dw: this is stupid ti: oh, give me the ticket, i'll clip it for you at the station [train gets to station and the ticket gets clipped at the machine two meters from the carriage door] ti: here you go, remember to clip at the red machine when you return dw: this is stupid, i didn't ask for this type of ticket

						   once again, for me the 1432th time, it is friday. the weekend is only an early lunch and a swift afternoon away.  what, pray-tell, will i be doing this evening? harry potter. yes that little english chap who i have grown so fond of. i hate ron, despise the malfroids and will be missing the original dumbledore.  chapter three, the movie, is upon us and for those of us who spent their youth in front of a computer screen and didn't get into the book reading thing, this is how to enjoy harry potter, in all its full imperial-cinema-surround-sound-warner-brothers glory.  here's to hoping ron vanishes in this one, or at the very least turns mute!  oh yes, maybe it is 'cos i am a non-dane, but isn't it just so tiresome with all these drunk students driving around making one hell of a hoo-haa down on vesterbrogade. bugger off please i am trying to work, um, yes that's it, work!

						   wednesday, the only day of the week in which pesimists and optimists unite. far enuff away from the weekend, that it's close enuff to start looking forward to it with a real sense of hope, that you just might make it to friday afternoon in one piece.  and so it is today, wednesday the 16th of july 2004 anno domini, i will be starting a blogg. this may last a day or two, or i could get used to this and continue for three, who knows. then again sheep eat grass.

						   Yes, that is, very briefly told, what we have been up to for the last month.  London: We took off Friday afternoon, and descended on a  very  slow journey to London Heathrow, an even slower ride with the train to Watford, finally to arrive at our destination: Ten and Chick's apartment. The rest of the weekend was lovely though, and worth every hassle of Brazilian airlines and slow London trains.  Legoland: a full family trip with grandparents, children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law and so on... If you are searching for the child within, Legoland is the place to go. Here you have everything from miniature cities built out of Lego, rollercosters to make you scream your lungs out, carousels that will make you very dizzy, lots of food, coca cola and popcorn.  Norway: friends have a summer house up on the mountain in Norway overseeing the ocean. Who can say no to an invitation like that... The occasion was the baptising of friend's daughter. Nice weather, lots of relaxation, beer and braais so it was a close to perfect weekend.  Sick: The obligatory summer flu hit us hard as rain on a typical Danish summers day, and the only solution: stay in bed, sleep, drink lots of hot tea and try to get sympathy from as many of your friends and family as possible.

						   People I saw on the bus this morning on my way to work:   - A very pretty lady, with long blonde hair in a pony tail, a nice grey sequined jacket, skirt and silver shoes. Shame with those black circles under her eyes... - The guy sitting next to me by the window, trying to hide that he was picking his nose.  - A young man I see quite often, who always wears sunglasses. (Today it was actually sunny, so nothing strange about that, it is just a bit strange all the other days when it is not sunny).  - A chubby little man, sitting down next to another chubby man, and they are both shifting around uncomfortably, trying not to touch each other. - A woman with big, curly, just-out-of-bed hair, sitting exactly in the middle of the seats, with one bum cheek on each seat.  -A woman with big, thick winter boots. They were suede and looked expensive, so I guess she wants her moneys worth and wears the boots any day of the year it is not raining. - A normally build man with a big bum in nice pleated trousers. The trousers were a couple of sizes to small, making the pleats disappear where the trousers were clinging to his bum.  - A short, tubby Asian woman wearing a white skirt with Danish flags, pointy, high heeled, buckled boots, a black buckled leather jacket and a huge turquoise bag with metal nails.   The bus ride to work takes about ten minutes...

						   In the final days of World War II, the Nazis attempt to use black magic to aid their dying cause. The Allies raid the camp where the ceremony is taking place, but not before a demon - Hellboy - has already been conjured. Joining the Allied forces, Hellboy eventually grows to adulthood, serving the cause of good rather than evil.  Yes, that is the plan for tonight... Two hours in the company of a red monster from hell... To me, that is a very nice way to spend a Thursday evening. And if the movie is as good as the reviews say, well then we are definitely in for a treat.   Have you ever tried to book a trip somewhere for the weekend, on Wednesday morning? No? Try it! Spontaneity is a wonderful thing and adds tons of excitement to dull, grey, rainy everyday life. It doesn't have to be anything other than just a little visit with friends you don't see very often, just to get out of the city and away from normality.  Life can be pretty good if you give it a chance...
