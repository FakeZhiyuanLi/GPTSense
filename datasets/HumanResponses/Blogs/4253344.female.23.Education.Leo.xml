       Why are we Human are so stubborn? We have this habit of realising out mistakes yet we will repeat. Similarly, when we know something is wrong, yet we will do it. A guy friend of mine ever told me, he knows that sometimes it is wrong to do something, yet he will tend to make that mistakes, but what he can do is to avoid making mistakes. This is indeed human nature of making mistakes repeatedly, but it is a matter of out self control and our own self in preventing outselves from making the mistakes. I reckon the tendency to make a mistake can be controlled by out will. The intention or desire to do something is one thing, but whether you will do or not is another issue. In my previous article of "Feelings", it is out brains that control what we do, however, if we let the feelings control, there will just exist the greater likelihood of making mistakes. I have a friend telling that he had so many regrets and he said he is meant to be like that and never be a good person. However, I always believe 'there is will, there is a way'. This is a matter of whether or not you have this determination. There is so many things in life that we can accomplish, it is just a matter of whether we want to make it happen or not. We may not make it a perfect one, yet we try and that effort will be appreciated. Of course, Do not give yourself so much pressure in doing a good job, what is important is doing what is like and what is right. Just be yourself! Dear friends, you all are special in your own way! That is why I appreciate all of you, every single one of you is my good friend. Knowing you all is a matter of fate and this is something that we cannot ask for. Just have a look at the world population, there are so many people. Yet we can get along together, I really treasure this friendship.

       Family is like home and a place where we can seek comfort and emotional support. I believe wherever we go, when we have a clear mind, we will naturally think of our family. I love the feelings of being in a family. It is so close and sweet. It is also where we can free of mind of being careful towards one another, as we can tell each other happily of what we experience after a certain while. In this context, I am not refering to the family that we are in as in home with out parents, but when we all can still feel like a family with those whom we have no any relationships with. Currently I am studying overseas, I do feel very empty as well when there is no one dear to me around here. This is not a matter of having boyfriends or close friends around you but a matter of experincing that particular closeness where is there no competition. As the saying goes, there is no one who can be your friends or enemies forever. No matter how close you are with a particular group of friends, one day they will still leave you and may even be your worst enemy. No one can tell the future! Even among friends, you may experience certain jeolousy, competition or even gossips behind each other.

       Feelings is a very amazing part of human. I always say I am the type of person who do things based on my feelings. However, is it actually right to do things based on feelings? The feelings to do certain things could be a result of impulsiveness without thinking it through. For me, I can fight the intention to do certain things according to feelings, can you? Perhaps, it is because I do not like to think, that is why I let my feelings make the decision. However, how many of us really willing to think? When we are faced with a problem, most of the time, we just like to avoid and stop thinking and let the feeling work out the decisions. I think this is a very wrong way to settle a problem. Unfortunately, born in this world, there are just too much things to ponder and it is so stressed to think all these things through...

       Why do human have to undergo illnesses before they put an end to their lives? From the Christian point of view, Human Beings are originally born with a sin. Does this refer to the sufferings that we have to undergo through? or Is this the challenge that we have to overcom in life? Have you ever wondered why some people have to to struggle a while before they really rest in peace? I always believe that this is what God arrange, even at the very last moment - the way you die and even the few minutes of struggling you have to overcome.

       The meaning of education means learning and expanding the learning of oneself, regardless of your age, ethinicity, gender, cutlure or even the society or country you are from. In the past, people tend to view education as a waste of time or just a kind of 'hobby' for the rich to do in order to past their time. The poor, on the other hand, had to work in order to sustain a living, needless to say the opportunity to gain knowledge. Nowadays, everyone has the right to go to Universities, doing their degrees, or even masters. In view of this, we can see a lof of people graduatinfg every year. Going to Uiversity is no longer a nolvety but in turn it is considered as a trend everywhere.

        Human Beings are a very complicated animal. They are made of the same thing, but somehow they are all unique in their special way, including you and me. I always wonder how many secrets they have. When I was looking the lecturer talking, he really gave us a feeling that he was a knowledgeable person. But, does he have a lot of secrets? I always think if we manage to know a person's secret, we can get to know that person's world - what he is thinking and what he intends to do? Secrets do link us to their attitude and style. Some people may have the hidden intention of being someone stylish, but he or she doesnt dare to express it. Why is this so? Why do they have to hide? This kind of character, to me, is really making a person contradicting themselves. This is somehow like a sign of complication. Someone ever mentioned, 'One day, If I have millions and millions of secret and I lock in somewhere in my mind, it will be the most interesting and coolest thing that I think I have ever done'. From, here, human love to lock up their 'secrets' or tell someone else, which will be spread to others. To me, secrets are something that cannot be kept forever. So, why not you yourself be the one who express it in a different way? Express what you think in a different way, and through your attitude and the things you do. If I could get to know the secrets of people and read the mind of the people, I would make them into my little projects and create an 'image' for them. Personally, I am interested in 'image design', I think people grow and they are different at different stage of life. Their mind will change and their concepts may never be the same as previous thought. Flexibility is also another factor has to be brought into consideration. Studying human beings is a very interesting thing to do. There are too many people, of different attitude, culture, society and so on. Each of us does have something to say, but we cant listen to everyone of them - just too many of them. From my point of view, I am sorry to bring in the concept of judging a person by appearance, but I do believe the world of fashion plays an important role in expressing a person's thought, belief, or even reflects their culture. Franky speaking, I am the type of person who likes to be straightforward and dont beat around the bush. Personally, I cant really keep a secret of myself, I really have to express it in order to feel less stressed and better. This is due to the fact I know I cant keep my secret.... So, do u think you are one as well?

      "What a day to begin with?" Never in my life had I dont something like this, so I think it is something new and interesting to me LOL. I cant believe that this is the very first thing I do since I woke up an hour ago. I am a person who do things base on my feelings and this is unexpected. It was my heart telling me to create a blog today. Talking about it, I feel weird. We cant let feelings control us sometimes, though. Human beings still have to think before they act. I am currently a student and just turned 23. I cant imagine that I have lived 23 years of life yet i dont feel like 23 at all. Life is full of experiences and unexpected events. I reckon knowing a person doesnt need to know everything at one go. We need to study through their daily activities and pick bits and pieces out of it and put them together just like a jig saw puzzle. "Isnt it interesting?" haha.... I really cant wait to start to enter into world where I can get to work. People normally says, 'Dont be silly, once you are out of University, you will need to go into another type of university called 'Social University', where it is a world of reality and harshness. Well, I am not afriad of the challenges ahead, as I always reckon, we, Human beings, are born with a mission and we are here to do something. Everyone has to undergo this, so why not we just pluck up out courage and face these challenges in life. Nothing in life is a bed of roses. So, just be cool as whatever happens in life, it is going to reveal...
