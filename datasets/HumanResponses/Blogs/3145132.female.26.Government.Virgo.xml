      I just got back from a trip to the UK on Wednesday, so now it's full steam ahead in getting ready for this trip. I got an email from Professor Malkin detailing which hospital I'll be at, where I'm staying and whom I'm staying with. It's so exciting. Now if only I can get all the little stuff to come together.

      Yes, after 14 hours of travel, I made it. My trip started with a 7:15 flight out of Albany to Charlotte, NC. Next was the flight to Miami. The flight out of Miami was arranged by EWH, so all but one of the participants were on the flight. When I got there Mike, Mike, Zac, and David were there. We chatted a bit and overtime the Amber, Sarah, Bill, Lauren, Chris, Brian, Darcee & IÂ´m forgetting someone. The flight out of Miami to Houston was delayed more than 30 min due to some late flight attendants, but we made it to the connecting flight to San Jose with time to spare.  We arrived on time, and promptly had to wait for our luggage. Darcees hasn´t even arrived yet! Then through customs where we were seriously asked if we were carrying drugs. From what I hear they are much cheaper here, so I´m not sure why I´d be importing them, anyway I responded with an equally serious no. Then off to the vans to head into San Jose. Once there we met our host families and headed out. With my lack of Spanish skills so far I´ve figured out my host mother´s name is Nora.  We (Brian and I) got a quick tour of the house and then it was time to unpack and head to bed.

      Just a note - I'm not going to be able to get online everyday (too much homework!!!), so depending on the time I have available I'll either backfill the dates or do a quick summary.   Today we had to be at the school by 7:30 am. Breakfast was a delicious slice of fresh pineapple and some bread. Then it was off to catch the bus for school. The traffic wasn't too bad and the trip is about 30 minutes. We got to school early and started filling out the registration form. Then came the oral exam to see what level of Spanish we were at. Mine was the shortest. I walked in Barnard started talking to me, I had no idea what he was saying, test over. Then came a brief intro to Costa Rica and the EWH program. I had forgotten that we were taking real courses and that there would be homework. Doh! My roommate (Meg) arrived she was in Guatemala and couldn't get here any earlier. Classes also started today and Spanish was first. There are two students (including myself) that had no Spanish experience. However, they put us in with five other students that have some experience, but need to cover some of the basics again. Needless to say it's going to be a lot of work to catch up and stay with the class. I did ok today because we went over basic verb conjugation and the process is similar to that of German. My biggest disadvantage is lack of vocabulary. I'm going to make flash cards and get a Spanish English dictionary, hopefully they'll help. The lunch break was just enough time to change some cash to colones and grab a quick bite. We ate at a cafe - I had some rice with chicken and vegies. It kinda reminded me of fried rice. The instrumentation class was interesting. We talked about pulse oximeters. It's been so long since I've been in a classroom setting with tests, etc. I'm half terrified that I won't get into the swing of things and half excited to be back. After school, we headed to the local grocery store to get supplies for lunch the next day. It took us forever to decide what to get. In the end we ended up with deli turkey, mozzarella cheese, bread, a munchy, and bananas. By then it was after dark, and since we aren't supposed to ride the bus after dark we caught a cab. Cabs here are plentiful and cheap. A nice combination.  Dinner was good, a beef soup/stew of some sort. I wasn't able to clean my plate, I'm really hoping that isn't insulting to Nora. After dinner we headed to the internet cafe until after it closed at 9. Then homework. We had to write sentences and a paragraph on various things. Hard to do when you have no vocabulary to work with.

      Today started better, we didn't have to be to school until 8:15. We ran a bit couple minutes late. The bus didn't come in time, we had to cab it, then the cabbie didn't know where the school was.  Spanish is pretty overwhelming still. Barnard runs the class in Spanish and it is difficult when you catch every fifth word or so. He says it'll get better. This is going to be a lot of work. So far much more than my instrumentation class. During lunch we found our way to a park in the area and had a discussion on "What is the developing world anyway." It was an interesting discussion, but we ran out of time. Instrumentation class covered electrocardiographs and how they work.  We finished lab early, so Brian, Meg, and myself explored the area around the school a bit. We were meeting people at 5 to go to downtown, so we had over an hour to kill. At about 4:30 we had had enough of walking and headed back to the school to get a start on our homework. When 5 rolled around, we ended up opting out of the walk and instead finished up our homework before heading home for dinner. I know, real exciting. Dinner was beans and rice with some beef. Yummy as usual. Bernard told us about a street here near U Latina, which is a great place to go out. So, we decided to check it out. The first place was packed. We hung out for a bit and then headed to a smaller one across the way. There was rock music playing, songs that are very common in the US. If I'm ever missing the music from home, I'll probably end up here for a couple hours. Anyway, we talked for a while and suddenly it was late and we had class in the morning. A quick cab ride home and off to bed we went.

      Breakfast was papaya and bananas with bread today. It's good, but come 9:30 or 10 I'm pretty hungry.  We ended up taking a cab again today because again, the bus didn't come in time. We're going to have to work on that.  We went to Spanish class, Chaplins for lunch, and then onto Instrumentation where we covered Blood Pressure Machines. The highlight was Dr. Malkin forgetting to give us our Friday quiz. Of course I had studied and was completely prepared.  The low point was when I heard about someone stealing Barnard's laptop from the school. The school is locked and has a guard/watchman, but unfortunately the thief got in. The laptop was worth over $2,000. This was a reminder that even though most Costa Ricans are very helpful and friendly, there are still the few out there that aren't. Tonight everyone (well all but 2) went out to the street by U. Latina and just hung out. It was a lot of fun. I got to talk to Dr. Malkin. He was really encouraging and I'm looking forward to working with EWH after the summer ends. At one point we went to a pool club and as we walked in a Maroon 5 song started playing. It was pretty cool. The pool kinda peterd out, and the air hockey was broken so we started to move on. Then we realized how tired we were, and the 5:30 meeting time for tomorrow loomed so we all headed to our respective homes.

      Getting up was not fun today, 5:30 comes very early. Again we had trouble with the timing of the bus, so we took the cab. Our luck with cabs ran out and we ended up with a 8000 colones fare, 10x what it should have been. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry and Brian was unwilling to consider getting out and catching another one. However, we were didn't let that spoil our trip. Today the entire group went on a canopy tour. To get there we had a more than 4 hour bus ride. During which we stopped for breakfast. The eggs were soooo good. They were kind of scrambled. So, back to the drive - it was fantastic! We first headed South and West so we could see the Pacific coast, then turned North and drove into the Monte Verde area. Now a canopy tour involves flying along ziplines over the rainforest. Not for those faint of heart, or afraid of heights. The longest cable was more than 770 meters long! It was a blast, and ended all too soon. Even Bill and Dr. Malkin, who are afraid of heights had some fun. Next to the canopy tour was a humming bird garden. It was raining, but we still went over to see them. I've never seen so many at once. I hope my pictures come out. Darcee even got to see some howler monkeys.  The bus ride home was again very beautiful. Just outside San Jose, there was a car accident that closed the road for quite awhile. I was so tired by that point that I mostly slept through it. I never really woke up after that. I was pretty zoned on the ride back to the house and then passed out in bed around 8 or so.

      I got up early again this morning, this time it was in order to get to the Irazu bus, bus stop by 7:30. I actually ended up getting there at 7. By far the first one in the queue. Chris, Mike, and David said they were going to meet me at the stop last night, but none of them were 100% sure they were going. At first I wasn't sure if I was going if they didn't show up. Then I noticed the number of English speaking tourists lining up and realized it would be pretty easy to go on my own. Of course, just then Mike and David showed up and we boarded the bus. During the trip Mike and David (who are in the advanced Spanish class) decided they were going to do the trip entirely in Spanish. Needless to say, I had some trouble following the conversation. Again the view was spectacular during the trip. As we climbed up the mountain there were fields of what I think were onions lining the road.  Irazu was different. You can walk in the crater of what used to be the top of the mountain before it was blown off Mount Saint Helen's style some years ago (1960s?). There is a green lake at the bottom of one of the crevices. We discussed whether it was algae or acid that made it green. In the end we had no idea which was right. If you know which it is, please let me know. At about 12:30 we caught the bus back. Mike and I got off in Cartago and checked out the city. The most important church in Costa Rica is there, along with the ruins of its predecessor. Pictures can be found on the page linked at the bottom of this entry. After wandering for a bit we still had time to head to the gardens, or so we thought. After boarding the bus, Mike checked the tour book and realized the gardens were closing in less than an hour. So, we decided to stay on the bus and take it full circle back to Cartago. On the trip back, we read the sign and realized the book was wrong and the gardens closed at 4:30. Unfortunately, it was too late and we missed the stop. At that point it was too much work to go back, so we stayed on the bus and returned to Cartago. We then caught the next bus to San Jose and returned to our respective host families.  After dinner I headed out to the balcony and worked on my Spanish homework for tomorrow. I think I've done my best work out there. Something I'm going to have to remember for future assignments.    Pictures for the week can be found  urlLink here .

      Today we were a bit late for class again. We're really trying to stick to the bus, but the timing isn't always the best.  Spanish class was really great today. We went over new verb conjugations. Pretty easy stuff since German does the same thing.  Lunch was a quick trip to the bank to get more colones, and then off to Chaplins for more beans (frijoles) and rice.  Unfortunately, Dr. Malkin did remember the quiz today. Bill was kind enough to remind him on the bus Saturday.  Lecture was on ventilators. A very simple, yet complex piece of equipment that I don't plan on messing with very much.  In lab we made little portable flashlights with a couple batteries, a switch, and an LED. I worked with Lauren because we will be at the hospital in Managua together. We finished early and I hung out waiting for Brian and Meg to finish. Barnard was teaching a class at 5 on myths from all over the world, so I flipped through a book on fairies. The drawings were spectacular. He stopped by and was telling me about how many myths are repeated throughout the world in different cultures. His example was the variations of the Rip Van Winkle myth. He mentioned similar myths from Japan and Ireland. Hmm, interesting. Then Meg and Brian finished. Meg and I headed to the grocery store to get food for lunch tomorrow and then I headed home and went to the internet cafe for many hours trying to catch this blog up.  Dr. Malkin was at the cafe setting up the website hosting various pictures from the past week. I mentioned using Photoshop to do it, and now I think next week will be my job.  Anyway, my host brother works at the internet cafe and my host mom had to call and tell him to tell me dinner was ready, oops. After dinner I came back to the cafe and continued with my blog writing. I ended up being here until after 9 when they technically close, though they don't throw people out.  Then came Spanish homework which I fell asleep in the middle of doing.

      We were on time for class today!! Of course I got up extra early to finish my homework and we were all a bit nervous about breakfast. You see yesterday one of the questions in Spanish class is what do you eat for breakfast? Brian answered coffee and bread, so Barnard got the idea that Nora only served us bread and coffee for breakfast. It caused a bit of confusion and we were worried that the pancakes she served us for breakfast were because Barnard called her. Fortunately we were able to get things straightened out in class this morning.  Spanish was much harder for me today. I'm always worrying about being the slowest student and holding up the class. It is always a struggle to learn the new information without fully understanding the old. We had another discussion during lunch - this one on Ethics. Lecture today was on electrosurgery machines. They can be used instead of a scalpel in a lot of cases with better results. During class the clouds just emptied themselves in this huge downpour. I kept having the urge to zone out and watch the rain rather than the lecture. Lab today was awful. It involved words like laplace transform, differential equation, imaginary numbers, and some others I never want to hear again. I was completely overwhelmed, and frustrated because I could have done this 5 years ago and now I am so lost. Meg and I had to stop at the grocery store for some comfort food afterward. Hmm chocolate and milk.  We headed to Office Depot after that in order to get notecards to make flashcards for Spanish, and I needed to get a calculator. It did not occur to me that I would need my nice HP graphing calculator on this trip. So, I got an ok casio that I hope will help me get through imaginary numbers. Of course with all the shopping and traffic we were late for dinner. Nora was not happy. We were feeling very guilty. Fortunately we were able to talk and get things straightened out. After dinner we headed to the internet cafe and then homework and bed.

      Before I forget - Happy Birthday Josh! Hope you are having a great day!  Breakfast today was cheese, bread, and bananas. I have never eaten so much fruit day to day in my life! We caught the bus today with Dr. Malkin (he was running late).  The first thing we did when we got to school was fill out evaluations of our instructors and host families. Then came Spanish class. We learned about things I can't remember right now. Very interesting stuff. . . Oh, yeah I found out I have been rude to my host mom because I can't finish what is on my plate and I haven't told her that I am too stuffed to finish it. Instead of going to Chaplins again for lunch we checked out a Chinese place. Very good. A about twice the price of Chaplins, but well worth it. Lecture today was on aspirators. Kinda gross piece of equipment to work with. They are used to suck fluids out of various parts of the body.  The lab assignment was to build an AM radio. I of course soldered the most sensitive part and probably cooked it. So, Meg and my radio along with everyone else's didn't work. On the way home Meg checked out a B&B. She's looking for a place for her parents to stay while they visit next week. It was really nice and for about $75 you get a queen (or king I'm not sure) and a private garden.  We hopped a different bus home, stopped at the grocery store (Cindy) and then went to the internet cafe which of course was full. I headed home, worked on homework, and fell asleep.  Dinner tonight was a soup with chicken on the bone, and corn on the cob. The broth was good, but I didn't care for the corn or the chicken.  Then we were off to the cafe again, it was still full, but this time I waited. A couple fellow students, Zach and David stopped by as well.

      Today our luck ran out in terms of timing and the almost daily downpours that occur here. It rained almost every time we went outside. As I write this, it has just started pouring. Earlier today during our picnic lunch discussion it downpoured. Of course today was the day we went to the park 10 minutes away instead of the one around the corner. Fortunately with everyone soaked, the lecture was a record 30 minutes long and lab was postponed. :) I have some pictures of us wet, hopefully they'll be included in the weekly picture site. If not, when I get my cable next week, I'll find a way to get them online. Dance class wasn't until 5 so we headed back to the house, put on dry clothes and headed to the internet cafe. At about four thirty it started to rain again. My sneakers were soaked so, I had resorted to wearing some flip flops that are very slippery when wet. So the jog back to the house in an attempt to not get soaked twice in one day was quite a feat.  Meg and I caught what had to be the slowest bus back to school for dance tonight. It not only stopped at every stop, but waited there for several minutes even though there was no one getting on or off. Then it skipped our stop. We were just barely on time to class because of the backtracking we had to do.  Dance class was a lot of fun. We learned Salsa and Merengue (sp?). It was quite a workout.  When we got back, there were these 2 cm plus long bugs crawling on Meg's bed and a couple on the desk. I don't know what they were, but we think they were attracted to our we books we had set out to dry.

      Today we finished section 1 in Spanish! To celebrate we played a trivia game with a pictionary board, monopoly pieces, and questions on little trivia pursuit type cards covering all we have done so far. It was fun. I got to move 1 square. :) Lecture was on microscopes. After class most of us went to a bar downtown to celebrate the end of the week. I got a pinacalada, not too strong and yummy.  At one point we ended up in a political discussion that most of us could have done without. Anyway, shortly into it, I realized that CNN was playing on the TV over the other end of the table. It was showing the ceremony removing President Reagan's casket from the plane that just flew it from Washington. It was a very strange moment when I realized what I was watching. It is amazing how detached from news and current events I am. I don't even know what the weather report is in the morning before heading off to school. After awhile we headed home. Meg, Bryan and I got some dinner at the Musmanni and then headed to the internet cafe. They then went out and I headed back to the house to study and get some sleep.

      We met the bus at 6:30 or so and headed out. The first stop was breakfast. Yummy as usual, and it was a buffet so I could get more eggs. The view from the restaurant was spectacular. (Pictures coming soon) After breakfast it was off to the rapids. We were broken up into groups - my boat had Lauren, Bill, Mike, Zach, Darcee, and myself. The river we were on - the Pacuare, has class III and class IV rapids. To get an idea I believe class V is the highest and hardest level. Only Mike fell in. I almost fell in, but Juan our guide caught me. Three or four times during the trip, Juan let us jump out of the boat and swim for a bit. It was interesting trying to swim in sneakers, but fun. The pictures below are from a CD I bought from a photographer that travels down river with the group. We headed for lunch and got changed out of our wet clothes. At this point I noticed that my skin was quickly changing from pink to red in certain areas. So much for waterproof sunscreen.  We ended up getting back to the school at 5 or 5:30 and five of us packed into a cab back to our houses.  Dinner was at the church down the street. I had two fried queso things. I think they were enchiladas, but I'm not sure. Then it was time to get cleaned up and go out dancing. We headed to the Pueblo which is supposed to be the place to go. I had fun for awhile, but the music was so loud and there wasn't much room to dance so Dr. Moratore (sp?) and I caught a cab and headed home.   urlLink    Entering the Rapids of the Pacuare River    urlLink    Left to right Lauren, Mike, Bill, Darcee, me, Zach, and Juan our guide   urlLink    Mike almost falling out   urlLink    More rapids   urlLink    Getting a bit wet   urlLink    Relaxing in a calm section of the river

      Today was my trip to Volcan Poas. It started out a little shaky when Chris and I arrived at where I was told the bus stop would be and realized it was nowhere nearby. Fortunately, a nice Tico who lived in the Bronx for 20 years (and was a NYC cop) kindly took us to the correct location. Luckily the bus didn't leave until 8:30 instead of the 8 we expected. We got to Poas around 11:45. There were two things to see - the view of the crater, and the view of a lake inside another crater. It was possible to see the steam coming up from the first crater. I think I got a good picture of it. The walk to the lake inside another crater was quite strenuous. It was the altitude of course. :) Occasionally clouds would blow in and obscure the view, but the wind quickly cleared them out.  After seeing all there was to see, we still had about an hour until the bus left, so Chris and I headed to the gift shop and cafe. I tried the local version of apple pie in the cafe. It was very different from what I am used to. There was a whole lot of crust and not many apples. Still good, just different. When I got back to the house, Meg and Brian had not yet returned from their adventures at the beach, so it was just me for dinner. One of Nora's sisters got me dinner, and then explained that she had cut her thumb and was at the hospital getting it stiched up. She told me not to worry, the cut wasn't bad. After dinner it was study time, then to bed.

      Over the past weekend I made a bunch of flash cards of verbs to help me increase my vocabulary. Today in Spanish I realized they were working. I understood a lot more of what Barnard was saying. Not all of it by any means, but more.  Today was Barnard's birthday, but he asked that we not make a big deal. So, we wished him a Happy Birthday and left it at that. There is a place called Bagelman's right by the school. I'm told that it is a chain that is in the US, though I have never heard of it. Anyway, I had lunch there today with a couple other students and for desert I got the most delicious cinnamon bun. The frosting was soooo good. In class today Dr. Malkin informed us that our project assignments were going to be emailed out tonight. I stopped by the internet cafe and found out that mine is generators. I googled generators to get an idea of where to start with my research and got more than 10,600,000 hits. It is going to be quite the project to whittle that down to the information I need.

      I keep hearing how the coffee here is so good, so I tried a bit at breakfast. Eww, it was nasty. I guess it is only good if you are already used to the taste. MCAT scores came in last night. Bill from the group did very well, and he had this grin on all day. EWH class today was a tour at the local children's hospital. Meg and I went to the wrong hospital and ended up being about 5 minutes late. We asked for directions and everyone said the hospital was "Alli." The first stop on the tour was the NICU. I've never seen babies that small. The tour was pretty interesting, and some of the people talked some in English, which made understanding them much easier.  After the tour we walked back toward the school stopping in the pedestrian zone so Lauren could buy a basketball and I could get some children's books to practice my Spanish. The shopping took longer than I expected and I had to run back to the school for a class Barnard teaches about mythology. I didn't understand most of what he said but it was still fun.

      Meg's parents arrived today from Florida. At lunch we ran errands getting a cake and other things to drop off at the hotel. When we dropped it all off at the hotel, the receptionist told Meg her parents had called, they had flight issues and would be real late. Of course Nora had invited them to dinner and was making something special.  In lab today we practiced trouble shooting power sources. At first it was hard because I wasn't sure how the circuit would react given different problems, but once I sat down and looked at what would happen for each problem, it was very easy. I even determined one issue with a single question. :) Dinner today was sooo good, I had seconds.  At the internet cafe tonight, I finally got coordinated enough to bring a CD and sit at a computer with headphones. It felt good to listen to some familiar music. Any guesses which band's CD I was listening to?

      This morning before classes started Gladys and Barnard invited us to their house for dinner Friday night. Barnard was telling us about his house yesterday in class, so I can't wait to see it. Today in class we had a little fun with tongue twisters. For example: En un plato de trigo tres tristes tigres trigo comieron and Compadre, ¿compra coco? -No, compadre, porque como poco coco como poco coco compro  The lunch discussion today was on what a biomedical engineers role is in relation to the developing world. It was very interesting. After school today we had another dance lesson. This time there were only four couples. It was a lot of fun because the people there were there because they really want to learn how to dance. Then after the first class the instructor invited us to the second class she teaches on Thursday nights. Three of us went along with Gladys and Barnard. It was a lot of fun, and boy was I tired afterward. Silvia, the instructor, was very impressed with our ability to do the harder steps she taught in the second class. :)

      Today no one did their homework (Barnard told those of us at dance we didn't have to), so we did oral discussions instead. Then we had an hour lecture on the history of Costa Rica. The class ended with a walking tour of San Jose. San Jose is known for its ugly buildings, but on the tour we saw some of pretty ones. Unfortunately, the tour was in Spanish and after about an hour of not understanding most of what was said, I started watching the scenery more than listening to the talk.  Meg and I headed to Taco Bell for lunch. Kind of ironic that I travel thousands of miles for my first trip to Taco Bell. I got a quesadilla which was&nbsp;quite good.  The quiz in instrumentation class went really well.&nbsp;Dr. Malkin&nbsp;asked us about&nbsp;fetal dopplar and&nbsp;the books definition didn't cover fetal dopplar specifically, but I knew something about it from when Wendy was pregnant with Piper.&nbsp;Dr. Malkin said I was the only one in the class to get it right. :)  In lab today, Lauren and I tried to fix the radios we built last week. No luck. I then had to run to the grocery store to get a cake and candles for dinner tonight. It was a surprise for everyone whose birthday is this month and next. Of course it started to rain as I headed out to get the cake, fortunately it only dripped - no real downpour.  When I got back to school I had to hide the cake, so&nbsp;Barnard offered his&nbsp;classroom. I of course didn't tell him he was one of the people it was for.  Then it was back to lab to work on a power supply. Finally, it was 5 and time to head to the party. We all piled into cabs and headed to their house. Fortunately Gladys had taken the cake with her so I didn't have to come up with an awkward explanation for the big white box in my lap.  It was about a half hour trip to the party. I love Barnard and Gladys' house! It was very modern, with a patio in back and a yard. The party was fabulous.&nbsp;Gladys made this bean dip that was sooo good. Barnard manned the grill with some delicious results. The chicken was really great (even with the wait!). I think everyone had a good time. (Some more than others ;) ) The cake was a hit too. Most all the birthday people were surprised (Gladys, Meg's mom, Sarah, &amp; Amber). Meg knew about it and Lauren accidentally told Barnard. Still&nbsp;it was&nbsp;great success.  All too soon it was time to head home. Of course there was a little excitement on the trip home. Barnard called for a cab to take Meg's parents, Meg and myself home, but unbeknownst to him, a pirate cab was sent. There was a police roadblock on the way home at which time the driver informed us if we got stopped to not tell the police we were in a cab. Of course it wasn't obvious at all, a Tico in front with a group of gringos in the back, no officer we're not in a taxi. The cab was pulled over, and the driver did get a ticket, for what I don't know.&nbsp;Fortunately the police didn't talk to us and it was a quiet trip the rest of the way back.

      Yup, I am now living and working in Managua, Nicaragua. I don't have time to write much, but I wanted everyone to know that it was a long and uneventful trip.

      Well, things have begun to get into some kind of schedule so, hopefully I'll be able to get to this internet cafe and update you all more frequently. The hard part is that it isn't really safe to walk here from home after dark.  I really like work. It's so great to be finally using my skills and common sense toward something where I can see the results. Lauren and I have repaired a couple pieces of equipment, but our main focus at the moment is to finish the hospital inventory. We are going from room to room checking every pieces of medical equipment against an old list the hospital has. We then affix an EWH inventory tag and move on to the next piece. In four days we've gotten to the clinical lab, rehab, ICU, cardiac ward, and one operating room. Lenin Fonseca has about 280 beds, so we have a lot to go.  Today we delivered a bedside monitor (that we fixed!) to a neurology room that had only one working monitor for six beds. We walked in with it and within a minute or two it was hooked up to a patient. They were very happy to have it.  This past Friday, Brian, Lauren, Mike, and I went to San Juan del Sur in the south of Nicaragua. I was amazed at the number of 20 or 30 something US and European tourists. Our first night we met a group of four a Welshman, a guy from the US, a Belgian, and a Swiss. (I think) They had run into each other at various places around the country and begun to travel together. They showed us the town and we had a blast hanging out. On Saturday we took a water taxi to the most beautiful secluded beach. The hotel there was $6 a night. Hard to beat.

      Greetings from Granada!  Meg and Darcee took the bus down from Leon last night and this morning Meg and I headed to Jinotepe. There we met up with Dr. Muratore (sorry about the spelling), Zack, Dave, Sarah, Amber, and Chris to give out school supplies at this extremely poor village outside Jinotepe.  It was great fun to talk and play with the kids. I got some great pictures. Then a bunch of us caught&nbsp;a minibus to Granada. Sarah, Amber, Chris and Dr. Muratore had to head back to Jinotepe, but Meg and I have found this amazing hostel that has AC, free internet, free 15 minute call to the US, and a tiny little pool for $7.50 a night! Sometime today we're supposed to meet up with&nbsp;Lauren, Darcee, Mike, and Brian at the Bearded Monkey hostel, but so far no luck. Well, time for a swim, dinner, and then the fiesta that's going on tonght! &nbsp;

      Well, Granada was beautiful and we had to leave all too soon. We stayed at the Hostel Oasis and thanks to their unlimited free internet I was able to put a bunch of pictures up from the Costa Rica portion of my trip. The hostel was great oly $7.50 for a room with air conditioning, pool, tv with dvds, unlimited internet, and a 15 minute call to the US. If you're ever in Granada, it's a great place to stay. Anyway, Meg and I got a little shopping done and then caught the minibus back to Jinotepe for the festivities here. The minibus was packed and we ended up with 5 people in our three person row. There was something like 20 people in this little van. We got to Jintepe and with a little help from the locals found Luis' house. Sarah and Amber were there and we hung out until Zach, David, Dr. Muratore, Luis, and his wife got back from Caterina. We headed to the grocery store and loaded up on the local Flor de Cana rum, coke, and ice.  We started partying then headed out to the horse parade. The parade was not really what I expected. Riders were going back and forth and just standing at various places in the street. We watched for awhile, then headed back to the house to cool off.  Then it was time for dinner. We went to a place called Sabados muched on some carne asada and then went dancing. Later there was a concert, the group was introduced as the number one Nicraguan group, but I didn't catch the name. It was three guys all dressed the same, with a band behind them dressed the same, but different from the three singers. We had a good time, but all too soon our ride, and host was leaving.  We found Zach back at the house and hung out for awhile before heading to bed.

      Greetings from Miami! Yup, I'm back in the States. The trip back went well and I'm excited to be home. Hopefully, over the next couple weeks or so I'll be able to fill the mising days.
