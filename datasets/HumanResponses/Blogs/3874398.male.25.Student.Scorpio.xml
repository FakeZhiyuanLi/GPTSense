      3 Dingers from Albert in an amazing come from behind win against the Cubs.  unfortunately the story is very familiar--the Redbirds' offense bails out the starting pitching.&nbsp; I weary of my Doom and Gloom, fire and brimstone, Jonathan Edwards impression, but we need a dominate starter.&nbsp;   Could the old adage be wrong?&nbsp; "Good pitching beats good hitting."&nbsp; Can you have good enough hitting to overwhelm the best pitching available?&nbsp; If the Card's stay as is, we will see a whether it holds true.  -CJ

      8 IP 4ER...not too shabby.&nbsp; Still 4 ER.&nbsp; The Cardinals are still relying on scoring a ton.&nbsp; Please let me be wrong, but I still feel the Cardinals will come crashing back to Earth soon.&nbsp;  &nbsp; On another note, Zambrano, regarding his second pitch that hit Edmonds: "Meanwhile, Zambrano insisted he wasn't trying to hit Edmonds, that he was just trying to 'make my pitch and the ball went out of my hand.'"&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyone who saw that game would tell you it was no accident.&nbsp; This reminds me of when my mother asked my little brother, Joey, &nbsp;if he pooped his diaper.&nbsp; Looking her straight in the face he said, "Daddy did it."&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, Zambrano and his attitude just plain stink.&nbsp; Hopefully his "accidents" won't get someone seriously injured in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; -CJ

      1. Roger Cedeno ($5.4 Million)-Is this not the most expensive non-everydayer?&nbsp; What an unfortunate bust.&nbsp; I have no idea how we could unload this guy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  2. Matt Morris ($12.5 Million)-Matt ain't what he used to be (altough he pitched decently yesterday).&nbsp; He definitely isn't worth over 1/8 the team payroll.&nbsp; It pains me to say this, but I seriously doubt Matt will be with us next year.&nbsp; &nbsp;-CJ

      "The Cardinals need someone to be able to put up all zeroes on occasion -- Morris has been a disappointment there...The pitching staff is serviceable, but not spectacular. Upgrades will be needed if they really expect to hold off the Cubs' charge.  The stars are aligning (Wood, Prior and Sosa off the DL) for (the Cubs)...a serious second-half run at the vulnerable Cardinals, who might eventually show chinks in their rotation."  -Eric Mack SportsLine.com Staff Writer  I am the homely man, unshaven, and dirty holding a sign saying, "Repent the End is near--if we don't aquire more pitching."  My friend Peter White, http://www.all-baseball.com/marinermusings, made sure to tell me not to be too picky.  However, when your team has been playing way above itself you want to make sure your team stays there.  More's the pity for the hapless Mariners.  The Cardinals desperately (maybe not obviously) need a shut-down man in the rotation. -CJ

      Who has the best record per money spent? Where do our small Midwestern finches stand?   "You gotta spend money to make money."  In the case of MLB you have to spend money to make championships.  The following stats are Winning % divided by millions spent for 2004.  Teams want to have a higher WPPM, but as you will see, teams that are not willing to be bargain hunters will probably wind up playing in October.  Current Standings:  NL Central  WPPM    Cardinals    7.7 Cubs         5.9 Reds        12.4 Brewers     18.7  Astros       6.8 Pirates     11.3  NL East     WPPM Phillies     5.7 Braves       5.8 Marlins     12.2 Mets         5.3 Expos        8.3  NL West     WPPM Dodgers      6.2 Giants       6.7 Padres       8.3 Rockies      6.0 DBacks       5.0  AL Central  WPPM White Sox    8.1 Twins       10.0 Indians     13.8 Tigers       9.7 Royals       7.6  AL East     WPPM Yankees      3.5 Red Sox      4.7 DRays       16.7 Blue Jays    8.7 Orioles      9.2  AL West     WPPM Rangers      9.7 Athletics    9.1 Angels       5.3 Mariners     4.8        So where does a team draw the line?  The Yankees spend more than anyone, but they're winning.  Cardinals are doing great at 7.7 and have the 2nd best record in baseball.  The Twins are only 2 games out.  They're WPPM is much higher than their division rival ChiSox.  Are the Twins' owners willing to drop their WPPM so as to increase the one stat that does matter PCT?  Question for Walt Jockety:  Are you willing to decrease the WPPM just a little bit in order to help shore up a vulnerable rotation? -CJ

      I know that one bad outing by Carpenter doesn't automatically make me right.  But...  "Chris Carpenter has the best record at 9-3. Like I said I want to be wrong, but Carpenter will probably not keep up this pace." -July 10, 2004  The Cardinals witnessed first hand the old adage, "Good pitching beats good hitting."  Kerry Wood's dominance of the Cardinals through 5 innings (Baker being careful on Wood because he just came off the DL) is just a taste of the power a dominate pitcher brings to the table.  St. Louis has 1. Hitting 2. Bullpen (So far) 3. Speed 4. Fielding 5. Power, but not a dominate starter.  Matt Morris is extremely streaky, and unfortunately can no longer be counted among baseball's top tier of SP's.    Pipe dream of the week: acquire Randy Johnson.  He would look very "Ek" like in the Cardinal uni.   -CJ

      I want to be wrong.  Please let me be wrong.  But Cardinal pitching is overachieving and it seems to be only a matter of time before we all come crashing back to this planet we call "Earth."    The past few years the St. Louis Cardinals' mantra has been: "yeah....but we have no pitching."  Riding the coat-tails of one of the best offenses in baseball will only get you so far.  This year, especially this last month, has been quite the exception.  The Cardinals' staff has mowed down opponents liked thin dried grass.  Over the recent homestand Redbird pitching has held opponents to 3 runs or less.  All 5 starters have been winning games.  However, the lack of a dominant pitcher is noticable.  Chris Carpenter has the best record at 9-3.  Like I said I want to be wrong, but Carpenter will probably not keep up this pace.  Before the 31st arrives, the need still remains: Pitching.  Simply because we are pitching well in this half month does not mean we can ignore the sins of the past.  Jockety SHOULD pursue top quality pitching--especially with Matt Morris refusing his contract extention earlier this year.   -CJ

      Ok folks.  Sit back take a deep breath and tell me why you want to trade for a left fielder.  Many in the Cardinal nation are hoping that Walt will make a move to fill this position that many say is unmanned.  I would agree that having a top notch regular left fielder would be a help.  But is that our Redbird's biggest need?  I don't believe it is.  Essentially, LaRussa has been doing a LF by committee.  Mabry. Cedeno. Lankford.  With Pujols' move to first base to cover the departed Tino Martinez, the LF position was left vacant.  Setting aside fielding ability, lets compare what we had last year with what we have this year Martinez vs. Madenford (Mabry, Cedeno, Lankford):             R   H   2B   3B   HR   RBI   TB   SB   SO   BB   AVG Tino      66  130  25    2   15    69   204  1    71   53   .273  Madenford 49   92  17    2   12    41   149  4    82   42   .271  "HA!" you say.  "Tino's stats are so much better than this platoon manning LF.  Hold on a minute "lead-foot," these are just half a season's stats for our three-headed LF'er v. an entire year's worth of stats for Tino.  Now the only glaring stat against this year's LF'er is the SO's.  If we are going to trade for anything let it be for something that has been our weakness for the past few years.... -CJ

      Let's cut to the chase and break down where our Card's are at:  CENTRAL    W  L   PCT GB   HOME  ROAD  EAST  CENT WEST   L10  STK  St. Louis  52 32 .619 -    26-17 26-15 10-8  26-22 5-1   7-3  W6  Chicago    46 38 .548 6.0  25-16 21-22 5-1   24-24 9-9   5-5  L3  Milwaukee  44 38 .537 7.0  24-17 20-21 8-4   16-18 12-12 6-4  W3  Cincinnati 44 40 .524 8.0  25-15 19-25 14-10 18-18 7-5   3-7  L3  Houston    43 41 .512 9.0  22-20 21-21 6-6   26-25 4-5   5-5  W1  Pittsburgh 38 44 .463 13.0 18-22 20-22 7-2   23-26 6-6   9-1  W1   With the 3-game series against the Cubs almost upon us, this is a great time to put even more distance between the Redbirds and the rest of the Central.    Probables: 7/9 Marquis(8-4, 4.10) v. Maddux(7-6, 4.43) 7/10 Suppan(7-5, 3.35) v. Clement(7-7, 2.83) 7/11 Carpenter(9-3) v. Wood(3-3) *Wood is expected to start, but will not be a sure thing until he meets up with the team in St. Louis.  With the Reds and the Brewers beating up on each other this looks to be an exciting time for the Cards to continue to flourish in the strong Central division.   -CJ

      Please pray for all those who may be affected by the hurricane.  A. For those of you who have been trying to reach me at  urlLink shelton@netscape.com  and are coming up craps, please email me at my wife's email:  urlLink gracejones18@hotmail.com . I will let you know when Netscrap decides to get its act together.  2. Looks like this old forcaster did okay. (Plus a good tip from another Cardinal website, Stlcardinals.com). Simo-man as Mike Shannon likes to call him has been called up from Memphis and So Taguchi has been sent packing. Personally I think the Cardinals would be better off sending someone like Cedeno down to AAA. So has a better glove, better speed, but doesn't really hammer the ball. With the aqusition of Walker, we can afford to send the $5M man (Roger)--packing.  D. Apparently I spoke too soon about a "player to be named." John Gall will still be in the Redbird's organization and instead the Rockies will receive 24 year old Southpaw Louis Martinez. He was involved in a shooting in the offseason, but was cleared of all charges (in the Domnican Republic). Card's claimed him during spring training off waivers. The final look on this trade seems to be a good one. Here's to Walker's health.  IV. It has come to my attention that I do a lot of complaining (not just from you, Pete) covering a team with the best record in baseball. Let me tell you why: Because this is the most fun I've had in baseball since 1989. (Will Clark destroying the Cubs in the NCLS) But this is the most fun since 1987, when my beloved Card's had to play in the Metro-dodge-the-debris-that-the-evil-towel-waving-fans-are-throwing-on-the-field-Dome. I don't want the Cardinals to do so well and then blow it. I've seen it before and it isn't pretty. My father still loves to remind everyone at family occaisions how I cried whenever the Twins beat the Cards. Hey I was 9! But I digress, I haven't seen a team dominate like this since the Mariners were ripping it up what seems like just a few years ago. I can't say enough about how well the Cardinal's are doing in just about every aspect of the game. I guess that's why I concentrate on the negative-- I don't have to write as much.  -CJ

      Stymied by Marlins pitching Cardinal bats do just enough to squeeze out another dubya.  Marlin pitching is pretty impressive.  "At what point will I start to get on the Cardinal hitting and leave the pitching alone?" you ask.  That's still a long way off my friends. -CJ

      Carpenter, Marquis, Suppan, Morris, and Williams have only missed 1 start COMBINED this year.   Come Sunday, look to see that stat rise to 2.  Carpenter made an early exit yesterday due to back spasms.  Although he said he should be ready to go, I doubt Tony will start him.  Look for some roster moves.  Pujols has bone spurs, and his trainer says that he will be able to play though the pain.  This injury is one that does not go away easily and should have Cardinal fans alarmed.   If you told Beckett that the Fish would give up just two hits in the game yesterday, I guarantee you that he would have said, "Deal!"  What you didn't tell him was that two of those hits would be homeruns and the Marlins would muster 1 run themselves.  In one of the strangest games all year, Pujols and Jimmy did what they do best.     If Pujols, Edmonds, Rolen, and Walker all manage 30+ homeruns it will be the FIRST time that the Redbirds have just 3 guys with 30 or more let alone 4!!!  -CJ

      I. Marquis has an excellent outing--against Leiter no less.   He settles down after a 1-run first to win his 9th straight.  To paraphrase the  Little Rascals:   (Insert Buckwheat's voice)  Pretty Good Pitching.    II. Just realized that my new neighbor might be as big of a Cardinal fan as I am--NAH!  Is there a way to measure--fanship?  The level of a fan is equal to the square of the sums of his knowledge of the team and his/her attendence at the ballpark?  But what about transplanted fans?  Their mecca-like trips across country to Redbird Headquarters should factor in as well...right?  I am passing this one over to the math department at the liberal arts college in town.  I'll keep you updated on their progress.  III.  Renteria goes 5-5 to tie the best hitting game of his career.  (No homers) Which leads us to...  IV.  Walker, 2nd or 4th.  If Pujols, Edmonds, and Rolen don't clear the table with one of their many home runs, surely one of their doubles will leave them on base.  Wouldn't Walker be good here--as a greater homerun threat than Renteria?  With all due respect for Matheny and Sanders, why put Renteria in a place where he won't necessarily score runs.  What a great problem to have!!  I salivate every time I look at the lineup.  Womack    .293 Walker       .321 Pujols         .319 Rolen          .338 Edmonds   .300 Renteria     .294 Sanders      .252 (Reggie is in a funk, and with his weak glove it's the one place where I can complain). Matheny    .253 (Matheny is worth his weight in gold via his golden glove behind the plate).  V.  The two players that were "to be named later," have been named: Chris Narveson (AA) a 5-10 Southpaw who was a promising prospect (he has been strong as of late) and John Gall (AAA) outfielder, batting .297 with over 20 homers.  Neither have seen MLB action.  Seems like great tidings for the Cards, but many Fred-Bird faithful don't realize that with Walker comes a surplus in the OF.  Ray Lankford, who was scheduled to come off the 15-day DL last friday might ask to be released rather than be demoted.  You can't help but love Lankford.  Here's wishin' him the best--whatever decision he makes.   VI.  At some point I might have to demand that we do the impossible and find someone that wants to pay Cedeno his outrageous salary.  Trust me.  He'll clear waivers.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal. -CJ

      Interesting. Very interesting. Walker, for a minor leaguer and two players to be named later. AND Rockies agree to pay 7.5 M of Walker's 2005 contract. I like-a lot-so far. Who are these two? Walker received a standing ovation and was key in the 2-1 victory over the Mets earlier today. But are the Redbird faithful applauding a tad prematurely? I hope not. LaRussa is all smiles. I hope--as I have chanted so many times now-that we don't need to add better pitching instead. -CJ

      A. Can't ask for much better.   B. Seems like every division leader is starting to seperate itself.  Cardinals are still 9 1/2 better than the streaking Cubs.  C. When Rolen reaches 30 homeruns it will be the first time in Cardinal history that 3 players hit 30+ in a single season. (Edmonds, Pujols)  -CJ

      Deadline has come and gone.  I suppose the Card's big-wigs know more about this stuff than I do.  I kept hearing the same refrain from players and "importants" alike: "We don't want to upset the balance."  Marching to the beat of "If it ain't broke don't fix it," the Cardinals silently went through July 31--confidently.  We will see if this will be another year of the "sins of the past."   Most important transactions:(in order of importance)  A. Cardinals staying put  B.  Nomar-Cubs think they can make a run at the post-season by improving a glaring weakness.  Once they get there, they are relying on pitching getting healthier.  This trade should worry the most confident of Cardinal fans.  C.  Loaiza-Yankees gain a VERY quality starter to an already stellar rotation.  At what point will the Bombers stop spending $$?  Does Steinbrenner have a limit?  How much CAN he spend?  Shouldn't teams at some point wisen up and stop selling their "pennant-souls" to the AL NYers?  -CJ
