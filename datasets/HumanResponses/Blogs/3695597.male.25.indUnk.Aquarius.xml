      ever felt like 24 hours is never enough for you? believe me.. it sucks! in between school sleep and work.. i don't have enough time to myself anymore.. it's like im rushin off somewhere everytime.. tryin not to be late.. tryin to catch up on one more hour of sleep.. no wonder people my age are just as stressed.burnout just around the corner.i can't even concentrate on my writing. just check out the drivel of posts i have up in this blog... i am my worst critic, and believe me, i don't wanna be me right now.  speakin of school, im takin up THEOLOGY subjects, that's right. coz this lame ass rector of the school i go to, saw it fit to fail me in most of my theo subjects.. i mean THEOLOGY??? im a friggin communication arts student!!! theology has almost no place in that field!!! i finished everything!! thesis, on the job training, i aced it all, and i get stuck one more year, because of fuckin theology?!!  and you should see the priests or seminarians who teach said subjects, the most pompus asses this side of the earth. take this class i had last friday. he outlined things he deemed immoral, abortion, capital punishment, protected sex, prostitution, euthanasia and lots more.. he just lumped it all together and said, these are immoral. what? what about priests who rape and or impregnate women!! isn't that immoral? why din't they write that down too?  prostutution is immoral, wasn't it jesus christ who rescued a prostitute from bein stoned to death and said let he who has not sinned cast the first stone??!!! and isn't one of his most fervent follower, a prostitute as well? mary magdalene? throw that in your face you pompous hypocritical schmucks!!!  we easily label people and actions, without considering the circumstances. what is really immoral, some woman workin in the flesh trade just to put food on the table?using protection while having sex to avoid unwanted pregnancies? being merciful in ending someone's life so they don't suffer more than they have to in this world? i don't think that's immoral.. do you? isn't immoral priests in the pupit commanding the faithful not to give alms to the beggars but to give to church coffers instead? isn't immoral politicians and high ranking officials, stealing from taxpayers money?isn't immoral hypocritical assholes preachin somethin and practicin an altogether different thing?isn't immoral a country wagin war on teh pretext of policing the world from terrorists but endin up bein inhuman to captives?  i am not an anti christ. i believe in god, i believe in a higher being, no matter in what name people call him... i just find it so hard to sit and listen to men of the cloth actin like they know everything there is to know about god. there's a scroll somewhere with this inscription: split a piece of wood, and i am there, turn over a rock, and i am there..  we dont need churches of massive stone and polished wood.. god is in us.. isn't he? he resides in each and everyone.. moslems, christians, buddhists, all religions of the world.. i dont mean to preach.. damnit.. it's just so fucked up, that countries wage war based on your beliefs...that we can't all coexist. that theology shmuck said i have a HUMANISTIC approach to morality.. not philosophical, or religious.. tell me, after all is said and done.. aren't we all just that? aren't we all just human? lookin to exist underneath the same sun?  i

      written in 30 minutes, in between calls.bwahahaha   SELLIN' THE DRAMA  chasin rainbows, not knowin where they lead searchin as night falls, for a weary body to sleep. lost in the mist of a hidden country i heard the winds howl signalling my sanity's demise  i fought with all i had,  till i was bound and gagged my bruised psyche,hurting more than my foolish pride i ate my humble pie  with the advent of time  my wounds have healed the scars an eternal remembrance i carry as badges of the years  im glad it's over the nightmares have been buried  the ceremonial toasts to a life long gone have all been said. all the wine has been drank everyone is headin home.  the ghosts of my past no longer haunt my existence the drama is done no more tears shall be shed.

      no, i wont try to explain myself. nor to explain the world. you shall look at the world thru your own eyes, not thru mine.  no, i will not rant about the state of the worlds affairs, but i offer a dirge to the death of a great thespian in marlon brando, and a silent prayer for a filipino worker caught in the middle of a war on terror, about to be beheaded by iraquis. all because he wanted to work to provide for his family.  and no i will not try to define terrorism, because it is painfully clear who is the real terror in this made up war.  i have no idea how many people will have to wash the world's sins with their innocent blood so that peace will finally prevail.  or how long, we have to wait, as im sure it will not be in this lifetime, or the lifetime of our progenies, if the very same people remain on top of the heap. and if the same way of thinkin exists.  as days go by the i feel the earth weep, shuddering in pain. if on;y i had the power to cure it's ails.  everyday, people search for heroes, someone to look up to. role models, or someone who lives your fondest dream, just so you can live vicariously through them, instead of pushing hard to attain your own dreams.. because it's too troublesome to try...  too bad, that's the way the world turns nowadays huh? well fuck the world!!! i ain't lettin go of my ideals, or my hope...  to borrow a line...and rephrasin it a bit....  though the world may leave my head bloody...  i will always be unbowed.

      i was cleanin out my closet today.. hehehe yeah.. i actually do that once in a while. and came upon this picture of me and my friends on high school graduation day.  there we all were.. freshly scrubbed in the morning sunlight, with garlands on our necks, diplomas in hand and arms around each others shoulders. we made the first hurdle.. who's to say we weren't goin to breeze thru the next? there we all were, me the youngest at 15, bright eyed gazing out in excitement, mingled with fear,as we were to embark on a journey. we din't know what would happen, just that things would never be the same again.hhmm, does it sound too much like dawson's creek? bear with me, i can be sappy and not be too much of a bad ass aight? it's allowed too you know. besides, im sure this off tangent diatribe will eventually come to a good end, hhmmm.. so allow me my whimsy.  nearly ten years has passed since that day we looked out upon our proud parents and grandparents, people from the town, fans.. hahaha. we were the new hope. ten years ago we looked into that crowd eyes ablaze in idealistic fervor.. change the world!! carpe diem!!! hell yeah kick asses now, take names later. later that night, we made a vow, to make it back to the old town every summer... and get together again.   the first few years we pretty much did, then things began changing, some people just peaked in highschool, and never outgrew it. some went to the states,in search for greener pastures, one got a girl pregnant, they now have 4 kids.yeah, some turned out as engineers, some tryin to be lawyers, some turned their backs on their dreams. still some of us plodded on.... albeit in no real direction. just knowin somewhere out there, there's somethin, and that elusive somethin... is worth all the ploddin we were doin.   now i find myself here, after the long years, after all the heartaches, big defeats, small triumphs, the fight goes on.. that kid ten years ago, i can hardly recognize that smile.. i think it's gonna be a long while till i smile like that again, probably when i get married, or touch my first born for the first time...  i've been through a whole lot these past few years, i dunno if i've gotten stronger or just numb.  but this year... it's lookin up, the sun's shining and i dont feel it's so unbearably hot, i think it's warmth is actually comforting.. when it's raining i dont think of the flash floods, or that im gonna get wet and sick with cold.. i actually think it's good weather to spend indoors with someone you love or doin somethin.. like writin, or readin a book, catchin up with others you thought you lost a long time ago.  and when it's a windy day... i don't care if i get messed up hair, or if dust gets in my eyes.. it actually brings me back to the days when i was a kid runnin around a vast field with my friends, pretendin we were flying somewhere in the skies. i know .. you're thinkin i've gone soft.. when it's so cool to be jaded and hopeless nowadays..  you know what ??? fuck cool!!! hell do i care!! i dont live life so others will think im cool anyway.  so call me soft if you want.. i know i'm gonna reach my dreams someday, i know that for a fact.. for now, im lookin forward to marryin and havin kids of my own, so i can fill them with all the love and hope they'll need in a lifetime. so they won't have to go through the hell their mother rescued me from... if growin up means goin back to your childhood,im glad i did that before all was lost.. and found the love i needed, and found the love i thought i no longer knew how to give.. i know it's sappy, but that's how i feel right now... so you don't like it.. too bad for you i suppose!!! hahahaha peace out!!!!

      just some random ink.... feel free to slaughter it. hehehe   ANTHEM.  did you see them, walkin down the street? did you see men whose faces you'd never greet did you see broken hearts and shattered dreams did you hear them play it on their guitar strings did you catch me marchin by arm in arm, my fist raced to the sky.  many tried and many died many more knelt down and cried bitter tears at what they have lost for what they stood for is this the cost as others turned and walked away, and others bowed their heads to pray. will you then my friend.. do the same?    UNLIKE YOU.  im not any different from you for i also seek something i shall never find a happiness that can never be mine i'm not any different from you  like you i also have my own insecurities my deepest darkest desires amid my little white lies  and like you i also doubt  the existence of a higher being at times when im jaded by the way  the world turns  but unlike you  i strive to search for the meaning of my being unlike you  i do not believe life to be a spectator sport nor am i content to let life pass me by unlike you i realize my trials are small while others are fightin bigger battles.  i am my own person not dictated upon by a superficial society i refuse to let other's shape my thoughts and beliefs i am easily caught up in the rush of things, and i love it when i fall and pick myself back up again... unlike you..  i strive to be comfortable in life's empty moments when no ones around to tell me things will be ok someday i hope you'll also believe.... that when the sun sets, a new dawn will take it's place.

      i have walked that road before i gazed upon the neon lights at midnight and passed out with liquor on my breath with the dawn  my mistakes were stupid charged to youthful ignorant bliss i thought i had all the answers it turned out i had the wrong set of questions  there was a time i looked at the mirror and i didn't like the person starin back i tried to remember what i looked like as a child i couldn't no matter how i tried  now.. i live my life at peace with the past no more dirges,no more alchoholic binges it's all been said and done  no more pickup lines no more one night stands i finally found myself again the me that i can truly love  and do you know? my past may have ended.... i suffer no regrets... nor will i look to ever go through all that i won't miss it... you saved me  for the first time i stared at the waxing moon sober and looked at the dawn, a smile on my lips with eyes not bloodshot from a hangover.  and it was beautiful.. just like you.my northstar.

      my gurl and i watched the new jim carrey starrer, well i know its an old film but geez even spiderman 2 was screened ahead of it here in the philippines. well it got me thinkin bout things you know, how if given the chance.. would most of us trade our memories just to prevent the hurt that could happen?  i mean, you know how you sometimes get stuck in a bad mood or a bad memory that seems like a fuckin dark cloud that you cant shake off? that sucks right? like yer own personal raincloud.  when others ask what the problem is you go... i dont wanna talk about it, or i dont wanna think about it, leave me the fuck be  then we wish everyone would feel as crummy as we do. coz misery loves company, and it won't do to have people askin you how you feel, but you just want them to feel miserable too, just for the hell of it. i know we all know how this feels.  but you know what? you erase or try to blot out all the hurt and you come out less of the person you should be.coz yer past, yer memories helped you be the person you are today... each and every hurt,each and every fall... we think of all the bad memories associated with somethin, what about the good? what about those times you thought you could never stand up but found strength to get up again, because of someone special?? aren't those memories priceless? didn't it help make each and everyone of us here, who we are?  i finally figured somethin else some years back... people get scared when the sun sets... people give up hope when the sun sets....  but isn't the moon just as beautiful???
