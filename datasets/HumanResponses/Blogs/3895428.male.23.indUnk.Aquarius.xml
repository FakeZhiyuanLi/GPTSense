						   Many people in the world are experiencing and encountering very strong emotions surrounding the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election.  There is much energy expended in debate and evangelizing.  Primal feelings of defensiveness abound, as mud is slung from one camp to the other.  The liberals are called unpatriotic and unamerican; the conservatives are accused of being corrupt and heartless.  I get upset about this issue, but I also think that it's something that must be discussed, not avoided as a taboo subject like sex or religion.  As with religion, those who do speak most often end up wasting their breath because the slightest hint of dogmatism will close the ears of their audience.  I think Michael Moore failed with a very important project because he was too fiery and too sarcastic to reach anyone but the home team.  He ended up preaching to the choir.  Here, as an exercise in my own thinking, is another very humble attempt to explain why it is vital that we get G.W.B. out as soon as possible:  Having G.W.B. as our President endangers our country.  He is a problem for us because he has got a bad reputation.  We are seeing the unprecedented occurrence of people in foreign countries holding protests against our present administration.  The 2004 election seems to be of equal or greater interest to non-Americans than to the citizens of this country.  Throughout Europe and the Middle East, there are many ordinary, 'man on the street' kind of people who openly despise our President and his administration.  In the past, we might have been lucky if the common people had any opinion of our president or even knew who he was.  Now we are seeing not only that people know the name Bush but that the name is often associated with very negative feelings.  See this quotation from a Washington Post report on a recent poll conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Centre:      "The survey, the largest of its kind, found slipping support for the U.S. war on terrorism in Europe and negative views of the United States in all foreign countries polled except Britain. Big majorities said that the United States does not consider other countries' interests and that Europe should develop more diplomatic and military independence" ( Opinion of U.S. Abroad Is Falling, Survey Finds  by Dana Milbank, March 17, 2004).  Note the language here: "the United States does not consider other countries' interests."  What do people mean when they speak of the United States this way?  It seems a bit strange to blame something as abstract as a country for such negligence.  Who, then, are the people of the world to blame?  Of course, they blame the big decision makers, Bush and his administration.  The U.S. is perceived as a reckless bully.  What is really meant by this, however, is that the public policies of the American government are considered reckless and brutish.  The negative opinion of the United States bears the name of Bush as its seal.  (We might point out, as an aside, that Bush concludes most of his speeches, including the vital 'declaration of war' speech, with the phrase, "God bless America," not "God bless Freedom," "God bless our Ideals," or some other ambiguous prayer that might indicate that likeminded non-Americans are included too.  Is it surprising, considering the lack of evidence for WMD etc, that the non-American public should suspect the U.S. of acting only for its own gain and self-interest?)  The first problem is that Bush is known and hated by many people in the world.  The second problem is that some of these haters are terrorists.  At one time, I thought this fact was universally obvious: Terrorism is not something that can be stamped out with brute force.  The London-based independent journalist, Gwynne Dyer, compares the war on terror to the war on crime calling it "merely a militaristic metaphor for an operation that is really statistical" ( A 'Statistical' Victory Over Terrorism Cannot Be Achieved  The Salt Lake Tribune, May 19, 2003).  In times past, Americans could decieve themselves into thinking that they were isolated from and immune to the world's problems.  September 11 made manifest the fact that this is a fallacy.  These days, the U.S. President must not only solve domestic problems and disputes, but he must try to keep his neighbors happy as well.  Sometimes G.W.B. describes in his speeches a happy, free Iraq in which the people all act like Americans, enjoying the luxuries of living in a "prosperous" nation.  One comes away with the feeling that he has got a plan to systematically rid the world of anything unpleasant, to create a heaven on earth.  When we come back to our senses, however, we are reminded that achieving peace in the real world is not so simple.  Communism could not quell the peoples' allegiance to divergent, deep-seated religious, political, and moral beliefs.  We will not silence the terrorists and bring them over to our side by means of either the fear of the American military or the allure of American wealth .  And, what is more, everytime we attempt to infiltrate Arab culture with either of these primitive tools, the anti-American sentiment spreads and is enlivened.  This in not an anti-American view or a pessimistic one; it is a realistic one.  If Osama is caught, do we really think that we will be able to sit back and relax in confidence that the threat is over?  This is just naive.  The reality is that terrorism exists in the world and always will exist.  What is the best way to control terrorism, to keep its statistics down?  The only way is to try to reduce the number of people who feel angry and desperate enough to do something about it.  Although it may be frustrating and slow moving, diplomacy is the only effective weopon against terrorism.  The use of military force is the best way to  irritate  and  worsen  the problem; the installation of American businesses and other purveyors of Western culture is the second best.    To reelect G.W.B. would help to transform the remaining anti-Bush sentiment into anti-American sentiment.  It would send a message to the world that American citizens support the man who is despised, the one who is blamed for so many peoples' grievances.  It might just send the message to the world that it is not really so tragic when American citizens are blown up, because they support the man who gave terrorists the reason to act.

						   I am a 23-year-old Anglo-American boy.  I have 23 years, but the statement is strangely discomforting when phrased in the French way.  It seems to imply the question, What do I really have from having lived 23 years?  What privilege might I rightfully claim thanks to my 23 years of experience?  These questions are discomforting because I suspect that I might find myself rather embarrassed about how I have spent my time here below.  Why boy? I suppose I should really write "man."  Boy is perhaps out of bounds now that I order off the adult menu.  But the term "man" carries with it so much baggage in our tongue.  If we spoke Greek, I would describe myself as "anthropos" (man, person, human) as opposed to "aner" (manly man).  The latter seems to be closer to the common meaning of our "man."  At any rate, let's cut to the chase.  Why Anglo-American?  I was born in Mountain View, California.  I was raised in Painted Post, New York; Franklin Lakes, New Jersey; and finally Laguna Hills, California.  When I was young I used to consider the New York Mets, the New Jersey Nets, and the San Francisco 49ers all my home teams (I suppose I was a little confused about where home was).  I have lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico; San Francisco, California; Annapolis, Maryland; and Fort Collins, Colorado;  I have never lived outside of the United States of America.  So, why do I call myself Anglo?  I am, as they say, a first generation American.  Both of my parents were born and raised in London, England.  They came over to the States in the 70's for a job opportunity and they successively bore children on both coasts of the continent.  My older brother was born in Boston, Massachusetts.  He has always been the difficult one.  Perhaps it was the weather.  I was born four years later (my parents are meticulous planners: they made sure to avoid having to negotiate two college tuitions at the same time), as I have said, in the Golden State.  Ever since I was very young, making my way in a New Jersey suburb, I have considered myself a California boy.  My hair turns blonde in the summer, while my brother is a brunette.  To this day I have a deep, unspeakable love of the State.  My sister appeared right on time, four years later, in Corning, New York.  She was (and still is) a mystery to me, as younger siblings tend to be.  I knew a time when she didn't exist and now she does.  Who knows where she came from?  I call myself Anglo because I was raised in an English household.  My parents have certainly adopted many Americanisms over the years, but they could not help but raise their children British.  It was unintentional.  They did their best to assimilate: they adopted Heinz 57 in place of HP; they learned to pronounce burrito, salsa, and taco; and, as of late, they have even begun drinking coffee instead of tea.  But the English character (I would rather say neurosis) runs deeper than these superficial icons.  When one has an English mind living Stateside, there is no doubt that the English character exists.  I wouldn't be surprised if it were something genetic, giving truth to the old phrase "British blood" (I think Morrissey's new single has something to do with this).  Being the middle child is always an unusual experience.  It is particularly odd if the siblings on your flanks are, let us say, extreme.  My older brother was a real rebel.  My younger sister was a goody two-shoes.  Their polarity produced a tremendously electric environment inbetween.  Everyone watched me nervously, trying to determine which way I would lean.  I thought they expected me to be something, clear and definable.  Needless to say, in this position I often found myself feeling quite lost.  The feeling has not gone away.  In a month's time, I will leave the United States to move in with my Grandfather (whom I've never known very well) in Jolly old England.  The reasons why?  They are manifold.  A primary motivation, however, is the feeling of being quite fuzzy on the who am I question.  I don't really understand my British blood.  I have found that I don't fit in very well here.  Of course, I don't expect to entirely fit in over there, but perhaps I will get to know better which are the Anglo bits and which are the American ones.

						   It occurred to me a moment ago that blogging might be a jolly good way of keeping up the habit of writing.  Letters are so infrequent and otherwise I don't really find the motivation.  So here it is: my first blog.  Do I expect anyone to read my blog? No (at least I wouldn't admit to it).  I suppose it's rather silly really.  The idea that my thoughts are published in some unknown corner of the W.W.W. motivates me to write more frequently; yet I know all the while that no one will ever actually read this.  I suppose I might as well be writing these entries in my private journal.  When it comes down to it, I am only writing to myself.    One difference between the blog and my private journal, however, is that the former is technically public.  There is the possibility that someone (albeit a rather bored or peculiar person) will stumble across my blog and read these lines.  With this possibility in the back of my mind, my inner critic no doubt will stand more attentively at his post and perhaps I will manage to avoid a few more spelling and grammar mistakes than usual.
