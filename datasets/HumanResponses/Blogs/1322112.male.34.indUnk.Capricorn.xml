      Had the weirdest dreams last night.  I was serving as an acolyte in a cathedral when I thought it best to get a quick shower before the service.  So I’m finishing up and at the sink brushing my teeth when I get this really strange, kind of creepy – kind of serene feeling that something or someone is about to reveal themselves to me.  Before I can grasp a second thought about it, St. John Maximovitch hobbles passed me and into the sanctuary!  This blows me away but in my dream I remember cognitively asking myself…”Hasn’t St. John of San Francisco reposed?  Then I realize how ridiculous this question really is when I become conscious that I’m standing in a towel, staring into a steamy mirror in the middle of the vestry!    Trippy to say the least…I say  weird dream( s )...the other I can’t really narrate the details to as I have small children…  Dinner last night with the Harley’s was brilliant as usual and not merely because of the Super Mex fish burritos.  Mrs. Harley gave us the state of affairs update regarding their fertilization struggles.  This is when ‘Is offered, as we had discussed a week or two prior, that she would offer her womb as a room for baby Harley!  Yeah my wife is a little bit special.  It was a very special kind of a moment where it’s hard to say anything but crying seems appropriate.  There was none of that but they were definitely touched…although I must say not nearly as much as I thought they would…probably due to the fact that they had already thought of the option!  Imagine that.  Oh well…MLS tonight!  It’s been two Saturdays in a row where we’ve missed Great Vespers on account of futbol.   “Lord have mercy.”  (3x)

      The world is spinning and I'm in a windstorm.  We discussed on a Thursday, that as a result of inheriting our mother (if even in the near future) and the rapid rate at which our family seems to want to grow, that it might be a good idea to think about buying a bigger house.  That was Thursday.  On Friday the sign went up and now, seven days later, we've had seven bids, all of which have gone at least $5,000 over the asking price.  A couple of which are willing to go $35,000 over the initial listed price.  Needless to say, we've pulled the original listing and have resubmitted what seems to be a more "appropriate" cost.  Whew!  It's crazy to think we're leaving.  With the oldest daughters' name engraved in the driveway (Remember the frame of mind you were in while engraving her name!) it's a little sad to realize homes aren't forever.  Good thing families are.  That's probably why we write in cement.    'Is is thrilled which makes me stoked.  God really pulls back the curtain when revealing a woman's strength.  We talked about California Craftsmen homes, which got me on the new home hopeful tour bus as well.    Might try and go for a surf tomorrow morning.  I've been MIA at tower 25 as of late.  Brownie and Duey haven't given me too much grief but I can tell the R-boys have been itching to ride.    We get to go and watch futbol tomorrow night at the Home Depot Center thanks to the Afusias.  15 minutes from the house, man that's beautiful.  Should be a good match too.  I might try and finagle my way into talking 'Is into letting me purchase a Galaxy long-sleeve.   Junior is stretching.  Given her size, she should be driving me to the store.  Homegirl is thick too.  Strong thick.  She is painfully beautiful too.  Makes for a dangerous combination for men in the world like me.  Makes for years of sorrow for dads like me, too.  She has the sweetest disposition.  It's a real eerie feeling to look at the girl version of you.  Every time Ma picks up the baby she whispers "I already raised you once!"  Barnyard is showing no signs of slowing down either.  She's even more dangerously beautiful than her kid sister.  Jr.'s that classic, I don’t want to touch you cause I might smudge you, Grace Kelly type of pretty while her older sister is that "Wow, I wonder if I got a shot with a girl like that" type-o'-style.  The kind of girl that make fools do stupid stuff.  It's all good, though…God's doing his work on me.  I'll be all grown up by the time I have to deal with guys like me asking out girls like her.   I'm tired...talk to you tomorrow.

      Whew!  I'm still tired.  House things have changed tremendously.  We made a bid on a house, thought we had it, didn't, and made another on a house that we -communally - really want.  I even requested the holy prayers and intercessions of my priests on this one.  Call in the "Big Guns" when you aren't messing around.    The Nomads had their first match on Wednesday and we got trounced.  No worries though, as the group of guys we have playing this year seem to be really pleasant and that's more important than trouncing teams.    Speaking of church…Fr. has put out the call for the need of adult acolytes.  As one who strives to be part of the Diaconate some day, I see this as a blessed opening for that…this should also provide a fantastic opportunity for retribution for some of the kids in my class to teach their teacher a thing or two.

      Teaching church school is always interesting.  I'd much rather sit among the kids and wax intellectual over the topics that concern their lives in the Church, than squabble the issue of  God's Essence vs. His Energies  with the  big brains .  The kids conversations are more pure, more true.  Cyb made a comment during breakfast that hit it right on…"You needed to have more immediate, communal siblings growing up."  She's right.  Her perspective rang true when I recalled the night prior…staying out all hours, eating pizza, playing board games, card games and character role games.  Joking and laughing until Dad (and the Deacon of our church) sent everyone home.  Hi…I'm thirty-three, husband and father of two and the most entertaining situations in my life involve teenagers!   We got approved for our loan -  "Glory to God in all things."   Equally important is that we think we may have landed a house.  It's in California Heights and is beautiful.  It needs some cosmetic updates - as it appears to have been architecturally designed by Mike Brady - but the house itself is golden.  Right across the street from a Distinguished California Elementary School too.  We're stoked.    Futbol is right around the corner -  What's Up!

      Got the results of my History 10 test last night.  The instructor placed both the multiple-choice parts as well as the blue books across three different desks.  Judging from the numbers billboarded across the top of them, the majority of the class didn't do very well.  Myself included.  Out of 50 questions I only answered 31 of them correctly.  I saw that most were in the low twenty's and even some in the teens.  I figured I was toast, for the essay portion had to be six to eight pages long and some walked out after only completing the MC part.  I needed the entire remaining hour and a half to finish up this second section of test…   Her teaching style is kind of erratic and often becomes distracted.  Sweet enough woman, but a little scattered.  She posts a list of terms - sometimes up to over 80 - and lectures, sequentially, throughout the given era of discussion.  Inventive approach, permitted you can bring the material to life and stay on track.  This isn't always achieved.    I had low expectations on the essay question because I figured there was no way I'd be able to recall the names and dates of the events we'd studied three weeks prior.  Well apparently you can still BS your way through the higher education institutions here in California, because I received the full 50 points for the paper.  This brought my score to 81.  Not terrible for low hopes.

      Had a terrible fit of panic last night when I awoke to voices in the next room.  Turned out to be mom and Is, but for some strange reason I felt dread.  No good reason, other than what I thought I could hear of their whispered heart-to-heart which seemed to be serious and subdued.  A glance at the clock read 1:15 AM, which brought consolation, but I still couldn't get back to sleep.    I'm forcing myself to call on God in times of fear.  I never did that prior to becoming Orthodox primarily because the situations in life that brought about the fear were brought on by myself.  "That's what you get", was my thought.  Nothing has changed about the circumstances but the response is altogether changing.  Something revealed to me last night, something so basic and fundamental to faith and prayer gave me such an overwhelming sense of optimism…  Last night after Vespers we continued our meditation on the Jesus Prayer and the section we read prior to it was an excerpt from St. John Klimakos'  The Ladder of Divine Ascent .  In it, St. John speaks on how we should pray.  Something I have problems with is finding  the words  to address God.  He says that to worry about what words we choose is absolutely foolish and counterproductive.  God often sees the chatter of children as being prayers most pure form.  Shoot…I can do that.  The panic I experienced last night liberated me from that fear of being in the presence of God while praying.  I have Christ as my Savior, I should speak to Him as such!  God the Big, Bad, Wrathful Ruler of the OT now has a softer side…that of a lamb.  It's no easier to get through to Him - in my tameness - in light of Crucifixion but His passion on the Cross is my inspiration to approach Him not as someone I owe debt to, but as someone who has made it possible for me to approach.  I can't wallow in  sorry-for-myself  ness while thinking because of my sinfulness, I can't approach Jesus.    Still, it's hard for me to turn to Christ in prayer when faced with troubles that make me mad.  I even get as ugly to think while biting my lip…"O.K. Lord, this is exactly the situation where you call on us to pray to you and all I feel is the desire to blow myself up!"  Lord, have mercy!    But last night  was  a breakthrough.  God gives me these little hopes to continue in the fight.  Almost more helpful to me is the grace He bestows to allow me to remember and recall them…  I'm tired again.  Late.

       "Dude…we're gettin' the team back together!"   That's all I could think about coming out of the mouth of Lil' Mark as I emailed the Nomads of the impending 7 on 7 outdoor league in Los Alamitos.  Red and I even went shopping to pick up new boots, socks and shorts for him to play in this season.  I felt like his mistress …"Oh no Red, those socks don't go with those shorts - you never mix navy with royal."   He's stoked to be active and I'm sure he'll fit right in with the rest of the bros.  Of course this means I'll be missing Evening Vespers with the family.  With kick-off times ranging from 7 - 10, I won't be able to make the trek to church and be able to play too.  Oh well, I did leave a stipulation in my contract providing me to be absent on special feast days and Liturgies during the week.  Speaking of praying…So I'm about to do my morning thing at the home altar when I realize that my mom had stayed the night and was conked out on the sofa.  We exchange morning pleasantries and she gives me an update on house buying stategy.  We kiss goodbye and she tells me that she'll be out the door shortly.    Well I spark up the charcoal, light the lampada's and go for it.  Not hearing the door shut anytime soon I realize she's still on the couch.  Well, outside of my family and a few close friends - well…and at church - I'm unaccustomed to having folks lurk as I talk to God.  So I'm feeling pretty shy when I realize that it may be that she is touched at the sight of her son-in-law praying before Christ on behalf of his family, friends, clergy, parish, loved ones departed, the poor and miserable…etc.    A half-hour later, when I'm done she says to me…I think I left my keys and wallet in your car!  Lord, have mercy!

          "Since this is the case, following the royal path and the teaching divinely inspired by our holy Fathers and the Tradition of the catholic Church—for we know that it is inspired by the Holy Spirit who lives in it—we decide in all correctness and after a thorough examination that, just as the holy and vivifying Cross, similarly the holy and precious Icons painted with colors, made with little stones or with any other matter serving this purpose (epitedeios), should be placed in the holy churches of God, on vases and sacred vestments, on walls and boards, in houses and on roads, whether these are Icons of our Lord God and Savior, Jesus Christ, or of our spotless Sovereign Lady, the holy Mother of God, or of the holy angels and of holy and venerable men. For each time that we see their representation in an image, each time, while gazing upon them, we are made to remember the prototypes, we grow to love them more, and we are more induced to worship them by kissing them and by witnessing our veneration (proskenesin), not the true adoration (latreian) which, according to our faith, is proper only to the one divine nature, but in the same way as we venerate the image of the precious and vivifying cross, the holy Gospel and other sacred objects which we honor with incense and candles according to the pious custom of our forefathers. For the honor rendered to the image goes to its prototype, and the person who venerates an Icon venerates the person represented in it. Indeed, such is the teaching of our holy Fathers and the Tradition of the holy catholic Church which propagated the Gospel from one end of the earth to the other."   I have a copy of this icon hanging from my neck. I also have charms of Christ as Pantocrater, His Holy Mother and St. Patrick of Armagh all on the same necklace as my baptismal cross. They give me solace and provide a constant reminder as to whom I travel with.

      From time to time I'll reflect on the darker things of life. A few days ago the wife and I were having a discussion based around our kids and the reality that they could be taken from us even while we're still here to witness it. I look into the face of my 10-month old and often say to her…"You're perfect!" What I mean by this is…just that - she's perfect. Her sweet disposition and clever character is evident even in her infancy.   God has made it so that the wife and I have been able to envisage our children's life almost before it happens. I think this is the mechanics of love itself. I was telling 'Is that it makes me uncomfortable, even in the joy of it all, to see the potential of their spirit captured in their innocence and the responsibility to their wholehearted trust in us. I try not to think about it and offset the mood by diving back into the doldrums of daily events.  Yesterday at church, good friends of ours disclosed a terrible incident of a cousin of theirs having a heart attack. The cousin is four. This floored me. The parents of the four-year-old have a two-year-old and the mother is currently pregnant with their third. The baby had no heartbeat for 51 minutes and the family has decided to take her off of life support. Lord, Have Mercy…the baby's name is Rebecca.  Having a heart condition and a rapidly approaching four year-old I can relate, but not solely because of the aforementioned characteristics, but more so of the aforementioned uncertainties. God lets me experience these perfect and beautiful scenes with my daughters only to remind me of His love for me. It works too, but in my self-inflicted dejection I counteract the joy by thoughts of unworthiness. I am unworthy of both the love He has shown me as well as the love He has shown me through my daughters.  Joy is a Christian virtue I struggle with. Having spent my life apart from Christ and His truth I often get drowned in repentance. Repentance is a more comfortable place to react from given my comfortable association with its causes. Joy always seems unwarranted. Then I realize joy is reflective in the life of a believer based on the reality of Christ in their life. I also understand that when I'm feeling joy it also makes me feel that sorrow is coming up around the bend and it's then I realize it's constancy I seek.  This morning at 1:30 the baby was stirring about for her pacifier. Not locating it as quickly as she liked she let us know by screaming. I found it although it wasn't doing the job. That's when 'Is suggested that I go downstairs and prepare a bottle. I wrapped on a robe and trudged downstairs to the icy cold surface of our tiled kitchen. I wanted to be mad at the inconvenience when I thought about this family who has to deal with burying their four-year old. The beeping of the microwave snapped me out of my lamentation to the joy of being able to prepare a bottle for my baby girl.   Lord, Have Mercy…Let us all pray for baby Rebecca and her family.

      Turned 34 on Wednesday. Feels kinda weird. 34 is not 24…it's not even  urlLink 27 ! The focus of this year - albeit rather sanctimoniously - will be to maintain some form of steady fitness.  Just writing those words made me shriek . Having spent the majority of my life engaged in some variety of vigorous movement, I can't grasp the idea of having to set aside designated timeframes for exercise. Welcome to Fatherdom!  Prior to kids, I could count on surfing everyday. Whether or not I did was up to me and the option was always mine. I think the motivation for indoctrinating the girls (Mom included) into ocean culture is to ensure the stability of my waistline. I hate it when things I hear about "things to come" come true…like when my Ma told me when she bought my first shaving kit in 7th grade, that I would "regret" having to shave daily. She was right…although…thank God for Orthodoxy, where facial-hair complacency is widely accepted!

      The repose of  urlLink Fr. John Sergieff  was Saturday. It virtually went unnoticed in my house do to the current chaos sustaining it. I did manage to have a hearty reflection on his life and the impact his example has had on me. A straightforward Christian existence was his approach to living and he was rewarded noticeably by God's grace while still here among us.  The only other saint I sincerely considered as a patron outside of The Forerunner and Prophet to our Lord was St. John of Kronstadt. He is an example for us all… Father John, pray to God for us!

      Finals today. After the debacle of misconstruing the submittal date of the 30-page paper due, my instructors have extended me the grace to present it at the date in which I thought it was initially scheduled.  Lord, Have Mercy . No matter…I still intend to take some time off from school and focus on family and home life. Maybe some music too. With Uncle Bev driving out to live on this coast, and the abundance of "in house" talent, it seems like the logical thing to do.  Last night at church we read the Canon of the Conception of the Holy Theotokos. A moving and spiritually educational service, although I was preoccupied with watching Jr. walking around the nave. 10-months to the day…just like her uncle Cruz. I'm waiting for her to make a dash for the sanctuary and try and bolt through the royal doors -  like her older sister did. Twice !   Holy St. Theophan…pray to God for me that he may grant me the wisdom and strength to properly raise up my children in all godliness and dignity…instilling in them the heart and mind to properly distinguish Your will for their life… and the fact that only clergy can move freely through the royal doors !    Lord, Have Mercy  (3x)

      Long time no babble. A whole month. Which isn't to say that there wasn't anything to say…it just means there wasn't enough time to say it.   We bought a house -  Glory to God in all things ! It looks like it'd be an Orthodox mission parish in Alaska. Multi-tiered and really wide. No cupolas though. Not yet anyway. It's kinda weird…it's a lot more space than we are accustomed to live in. You can actually be in one part of the house and not know what's going on in another. This includes the super-sonic-instinctual-built-in-parent-tracking system. Jr. has already tried to tackle the stairs (and with some success), although we keep her corralled behind the many gated stations throughout the house. We are all very thankful.  I think God is allowing me the ability to see into my future. Part of it entails me cutting out all extraneous activity. The two hobbies I foresee as qualifying events are futebol and school. Futebol most likely qualifies on all lists, husband and wife alike, although looking at school as a hobby would leave most people offended. It doesn't offend me…I can go to school whenever I want. I haven't taken it serious and have been able to look good doing it. Until now. Now I must and part of doing that is knowing when to back off, regroup and give it the respect it deserves when I figure out how that's done.   I want to live as the wife lives…for God & family. Part of this - and which is radiated so elegantly in the Mrs. - is her sacrifice for our kids. She wants to spend the remaining two years with the oldest, independent of caring for any other children in daycare. I do too. I want to work, pay my bills, and come home.  This is what God is providing…I think I'll try and handle it with care.  I will not be the poster child for Advent. Hell…it's taken it's spiritual toll on me in showing that the  rigorous prayer rule  I keep is for naught if I can't stay focused OR awake. Shame on me. I started mounting my own icons. Why I didn't think of it before eludes me. After seeing the black & white photograph of Fr. John at St. Anthony's, mounted on gorgeous black baseboard made the wheels start turning. It's enabled me to seek out some saints that I really had an interest in but never have seen them offered in any of the bookstore catalogues.  Ma's done with all her surgeries. Hopefully now she'll be able to focus on other things. That women is a modern day Photini - Lord,  Have Mercy .

         This quote from an alleged Christian website –  urlLink Why Monks ?   Historic monks, like the historic church, had fallen into unscriptural beliefs and practices, needing reform.    Lord, have mercy!  With Great Lent rapidly approaching, comes the opportunity for augmented spiritual training. Let this season of repentance, inner-observation and prayer be also a period of thanksgiving, piety and worship.   Oh...and  forgiveness  too!

      Fr. Michael blessed the house on Friday and as usual his serene nature and dignified demeanor brought peace to our home. And while he was unable to stay for dinner, we did manage to have yet another astral exchange concerning topics the two of us commonly share when given a privileged moment.   We also had “boys night” on Friday, which gave an entire different meaning to its initial definition. Boys night these days consists of entertaining the youth from church. Which is always fun seeing how it gives me the defense to play futebol in the street, rent movies I would otherwise never admit to seeing, flagellants (although I’m pretty good at those without the excuse of sleepovers), goofy discussions about all kinds of inane topics and best of all…the liberty to eat my bodyweight in pizza, chocolate and ice cream.  With the blessing of Fr. Wayne, I became a member of the church choir. It’s an absolute blast. With my geeky lean towards liturgics, I figured what better way to learn the liturgical calendar and services of the Church than by joining Her choir! I look forward to both the upcoming wedding in February as well as Great Lent. Whew…all those services!  Lord, Have Mercy .

       Troparion in tone 2  The memory of the righteous is celebrated with songs of praise, But the Lord's testimony is sufficient for you, O Forerunner. You were shown indeed to be the most Honorable of the Prophets, For in the waters you baptize the one whom you preached. After suffering with joy on behalf of the truth, You proclaimed even to those in hell the God who appeared in the flesh Who takes away the sin of the world, And grants us great mercy!   Kontakion in tone 4  You have appeared as a most brilliant light, Illumining with divine rays those who cry to you in faith: Pray for us to Christ our God, Who appeared in the streams of the Jordan And enlightened the human race.   Kontakion in tone 6  The river Jordan trembled, and was driven back Filled with fear at Your coming in the flesh, While John drew back in awe As he fulfilled the ministry of the Spirit. The ranks of angels stood amazed, When they beheld You baptized in the stream, And we, who were in darkness, are filled with light, Praising You, God made manifest, who enlightens all!

       Great Compline/Canon of St. Andrew  – Tuesday night  The girls weren’t able to attend last night. The Litmus Test to see whether Isabella could hang throughout the entire hour and a half-long service – most of which intrudes into her bedtime – proved against our favor, so we opted to keep them home instead.   I chanted for the first time. Not real pretty. Our Cantor simply pointed to the text as if to say - ”Go” - which is to say I wasn’t real prepared. Up until that point I was merely straight-chanting the psalms and singing along with the eson. Something I wasn’t keying onto as well was the fact that during Lent the overall mood of the tones change. So to sound like a 300-pound Russian deacon with a falsetto probably isn’t the repentant, somber mood the faithful are looking forward to hearing. Lord, have mercy.  Tonight is Pre-Sanctified.    Wednesday of the First Week   While fasting with the body, brethren, let us also fast in spirit. Let us loose every bond of iniquity; let us undo the knots of every contract made by violence; let us tear up unjust agreements let us give bread to the hungry and welcome to our house the poor who have no roof to cover them, that we may receive great mercy from Christ our God.   Vespers - Wednesday in the First Week    From the Fathers :  For if the work be laborious, reflect that it is for God’s sake you undergo all this, and you shall receive sufficient consolation.  -  St. John Chysostom    Prayer :  Dear Lord,  Help us to keep our hearts and eyes open so that we may be quick to see the needs of people, and swift to hear the still, sad music of humanity, Let us always be ready to help those who are in need, willingly and lovingly, so that Your name may be glorified. Amen.   Bible Readings : Isaiah 2:4-10/Genesis 1:24-31, 2:1-3/Proverbs 2:1-22   Meditation :  Come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.   Isaiah 2:5

       Great Compline/Canon of St. Andrew   Well, if you weren’t dealt a somber enough dose of the imminent Lenten season with Sunday night’s Forgiveness Vespers, the Canon of St. Andrew most likely set your mind aright.   It was enriching to be able to be part of the canters and aid in the service. I look forward to tonight’s Compline as well…   Tuesday of the First Week   Let us joyfully begin the all-holy season of abstinence; and let us shine with the bright radiance of the holy commandments of Christ our God, with the brightness of love and the splendor of prayer, with the purity of holiness and the strength of good courage. So clothed in raiment of light, let us hasten to the Holy Resurrection on the third day, that shines upon the world with the glory of eternal life.   Orthros – Clean Monday    From the Fathers :  Let our enemy too understand that we have taken much pains, in order to do what is well pleasing unto God.    St. John Chrysostom    Prayer :  Heavenly Father,  May we always listen to the words your Son Jesus has spoken, so that our joy may be full and deep and lasting, so that others may see and know that we have been with Jesus and done His will. Amen.   Bible Readings : Isaiah 1:19-31, 2:1-3/Genesis 1:14-23/Proverbs 1:20-33   Meditation :  But he who listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of evil .

       Forgiveness Vespers   Beautiful. It was touching to see so many turn out for this opportunity at public pardon. Also too was it stirring to witness so many who are old hands with this season visibly affected by its substance. Not to mention the beauty of our chairless nave. Lord, have mercy.  Navah never ceases to amaze. Many folks were taken back by her perseverance and steadfast approach at ensuring everyone she bowed to was greeted by the proper petition and subsequent dismissal of sin. Not bad for a three-year old.  Tonight we celebrate the Canon of St. Andrew…Lord, have mercy!   Monday of the First Week  (Clean Monday)  Let us begin, O people, the pure Fast that is our soul’s salvation. Let us serve the Lord with fear: Let us anoint our heads with the oil of almsgiving, and let us wash our faces in the waters of purity; let us not use vain repetitions in our prayers, but as we have been taught…Our Father, Who art in heaven…   From the Fathers:   At length the season moves towards the Lent of the Great Fast, and therefore, we ought the more earnestly devote ourselves to holiness.    St. John Chrysostom    Prayer:   Dear Lord,  As we begin this sacred and holy season of fasting, and as we strive to find You anew, help us Lord, that the prayers of our hearts, the thoughts in our minds, and the words of our mouths may always be acceptable to You. Help us to keep the fast, Lord, and give us the strength to finish that which we strive to do, that Your name may be glorified. Amen.   Bible Readings:  Isaiah 1:1-20/Genesis 1:1-13/Proverbs 1:1-20   Meditation:   Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.   Isaiah 1:16-17

      This from my Father-Confessor…   My dear spiritual sons and daughters:  I came across this uplifting story of one man's discovery of the love of God in his life.   "It had been my belief that God loved all of mankind, but I found it much more difficult to comprehend that he loved me personally. It finally became a reality through my own son when he was very small. One night as I stood looking down on my sleeping child, my love for him seemed to reach out and fill the whole room; I experienced an overwhelming sense of joy. Instinctively my spirit rose in thanksgiving to God for the gift of our son and our joy in him. At this moment there dawned upon my consciousness the certainty that God loved me like that, only much, much more. The assurance of His love ceased to be just an intellectual assent and became a living reality. It was then that I began to understand something of my own worth in the eyes of God, and through this recognition I found a new and growing capacity to love."   Always remember that God loved us first. When we hated Him He loved us. Your mother commenced to love you, but your heavenly Father never commenced to love you.  His love for you had no beginning.  His love is unending, spontaneous, uninfluenced, unfailing and eternal. He would have to stop existing before He could stop loving you.   "I love you with an every lasting love,'  says the Lord.  LOVE IN CHRIST   I could have easily been the man to pen this reflection as I know, intimately, of the revelation it conveys.   Amen…Amen…Amen!

      Great Lent has come and gone and with it a feeling of joy and sorrow, which is probably its intended affect. Pascha was a delight and like the season that preceded it, full of memories that has created a glow sure to last until next year.  A pleasant and dreadful accountability has come in the form of sponsorship. Benjamin approached me to be his godfather and with much timidity I wholeheartedly agreed to the permanent liability. A liability in the sense that if we take seriously the Church’s regard for the role of godparents in the life of the newly illumined, with it, the notion that the sponsor is not only responsible for the spiritual growth and maintenance of the faith in the godchild, but held accountable to God, the liability becomes apparent.  Lord, Have Mercy !  I took vacation time for both Holy and Bright week. I think this will become a tradition. We loaded up the kids in a rental and headed up the coast after our Paschal celebration. This I pray will not become a tradition. Perhaps the better thing to do would be to take a full days rest prior to driving 2,400 miles. We stopped along the way, visiting family, friends and godparents. What a blessing it was to be in the cathedral during the Moleben service to St. John when in walks two beloved parishioners from our home church. Glory to God in all things! Cherished memories with cherished loved ones indeed!  As I settle into the 40 days to Ascension, I try and focus on a less hectic schedule of services while trying to  refocus  my commitments to church service; singing/reading in the choir, teaching church school, advising the youth group and serving as an Acolyte are absolute testaments to Gods sanction for us to glorify Him with the attributes He’s so richly provided.

      Constantine & Helen, Equal-to-the Apostles  Last night my godson and I prayed Compline together. Such a blessing. He’s an immense inspiration for me. Kind a like my daughters. He stopped by for some “godson & godfather time” and like most visits, it culminated with a lesson in punk-rock/reggae HIST. 101, Super-Mex fish burritos and chocolate bars.        After completing Compline, he lamented over his inability to be attentive while praying at home and his continuing struggle with what he calls… still-stuck-praying-like-a-Protestant-in-my-private-prayers -disorder. I assured him that our Redeemer hears his prayers no matter how bumbling they may appear to be and that the significance of the prayers of the Saints and the Church are that they not only act as sureties against entreating God for needless desires but also to guarantee we aren’t praying heresy. He understood as well that the prayers we continually hear and recite act as a blue print for our own petitions.  He also expressed some grief about being somewhat languid towards praying at home. I told him if for nothing else to look at prayer as spiritual exercise and that exercise isn’t always enjoyable but always beneficial. That seemed to sit right with him but I detected he wanted more practical advice…    That’s when I told him I pray because I feel guilty . If I don’t pray for the folks that I say I will pray for, That becomes one less person interceding for them. And who can stand before God and tell Him that they didn’t have enough time to pray for someone who required His grace. Guilt motivates. I’m sure there’s a more Christian PC term to describe this, but for me, guilt describes it best. It is just the right motivation that ensures I do what I say I’ll do. This of course was the practical advice I think he was looking for, although not quite the terms to describe it.  Lord, have mercy !

       Sorry Karl, the comments only allowed for 1,000 characters!    But how does one know the inner state or prayer life of those who publicly "wax intellectual" or who are concerend about the state of Orthodoxy?   One doesn’t.   Aren't these questions only to be apllied to ourselves and not to others?   Absolutely.   Blogs  are  tricky things in that they convey - with words - an apparent expression of what an individual feels. Much like a diary, a poem or lyrics. In creating these types of expressions, the author cares about words only insofar as they communicate what he  feels , based upon his  experience . Ultimately, they are published to verify ones own experience to ones self.    Kind of like tattoos.  Many folks feel those with tattoos get them because they want to be “anti-establishment”, “rebellious” or “hip”. In other words, the motivation is to put forth or adopt an image based solely on what tattoos represent to other people. That tattooing can be a personal expression based on personal experience falls outside the perception of most people. Chronicling your life in pigments as a means of testifying to the experience of a life lived flies in direct conflict with the notion that someone tattooed is a walking billboard, and therefore open to all spectators. The reality being that the ink in an individual’s skin has nothing to do with the person viewing it.  This is also my feeling about online diaries. Sure there are comments available for folks to make remarks, but ultimately, and independent of those remarks, I post them motivated by my own desire to chronicle my life. And I do that based on my  experiences .  In my experience, the inner workings of the Spirit in daily life are most "blog-worthy".   Understand any and all comments I make are solely based upon seeing myself as the one being dissected. That again, is my point in writing it. Karl, I’m way too wretched and self-centered to care about others enough to bate them into a discussion about their personal piety.

      Ascension of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ  I wasn’t raised a Christian. Despite this fact, I believe wholeheartedly that I’ve always understood that the God of the Bible was creator of all things visible and invisible ( for those of you scrutinizing doctrine ) and that I just had to get the details. A testament to God’s love and sovereignty for me as well as all His creation is that throughout this process of working out these details, He let me live my life in a way in which the conviction for Him became congealed by my life spent  apart  from Him. In other words, only by living a life based according to my own volition am I able to understand what it means to live a life in Christ.  Something that kept me clouded from God and His Church were His contemporary followers. If being a believer was based on the behavior of those in America calling themselves Christians, I wanted no part of it.  It was kind of like judging the Oakland Raiders as a team, based on their fans . Of course that view, along with a host of others, have since been put in their proper perspectives and I’m in unremitting repentance even still.  Nevertheless, something that continues to puzzle me is the quizzical method some folks apply in understanding and  living the Tradition of the Church. In my church, which is composed primarily of converts from Protestantism, I assumed that these folks  absolutely  had it all figured out by the time they entered  the narthex. That’s why they were there. They came in droves to Orthodoxy only after their steadfast scholasticism revealed that they could worship God the same way Christ’s first believers did. On some level God Himself, as revealed in His Body on earth, answered their every question and concern.   To me, this has to be an amazing position of grace. Those folks who lived devotedly to God with only having a portion of the revealed fullness of the Faith have to literally be in a constant state of thanksgiving after having been given the truth of Orthodoxy. To be afforded that privilege, truly one is blessed. Just as those who have strong sources of repentance are truly blessed.  But what about living and applying that which has been revealed? What I mean is…how does our former self reconcile this saving grace? The old man is indeed dead, but the psychosomatic effects of a lifetime relying on ourselves to be the god of our life - not so much. This is our struggle. Do we use our personal history as a filter for things to come, pulling from our former experiences to separate good from bad, right from wrong in accordance with God’s proverbial  plan for our life ? I absolutely believe this to be the case…well…in my case anyway.  Had it not been for my past, I could not live the life Christ has given me today. Things I did prior to coming to faith in God, things I developed philosophies to always defend, have fallen by the wayside and are now filed as “old habits” of my former self. The reality of these habits and lifestyles are revealed by Christ Himself, the most intriguing aspect of this relationship being… the relationship itself . Christ reveals to us His truth and our life is a constant battle to be consistent with what he’s revealed as compared to the way in which we are accustomed to react.  Christ commands me to love God with all I have, therefore I try and love Him with all I’ve got, realizing it’s Him who has shown me the real meaning of love in the first place, thus equipping me to give love. He commands me to love my neighbor as myself and it is only by seeing God in each and every being, myself included, that I can appropriately do so. Again, he provides the example, I try my best to assimilate the model.   All this truth, all this meaning flies in direct disagreement with both our former self and the baggage we’ve accumulated. Baggage that keeps people from praying. Baggage that allows people to bicker over doctrinal issues they have no entitlement to while neglecting what Christ has revealed to them on a personal and intimate level. Why worry about the current ecumenical crises your particular jurisdiction is or isn’t involved in, if you don’t pray every day? What’s the incentive of being able to quote every Church Father of the fourth century if you don’t go to confession? How is it beneficial to your salvation to wax intellectual over Canons and Councils of the Church while not loving your brother? Are we forgetting God when we opt to act like our former selves.  Lord have mercy!   ...And Lord have mercy for these jumbled thoughts!

      An alarming trend is taking place in my morning prayers.   In the past six months I’ve had to move 8 names from our list of the  LIVING  - " For mercy, life, health, peace, salvation, visitation, forgiveness and remission of sins …" down below to the list of the  DEPARTED  - " For eternal memory and blessed repose …". Alarming in that I merely noticed it today, and also in that just last evening Navah says to me before I read her bedtime story…”Dad, am I going to die?”   This is one of those situations where you recall yourself saying …”If my kid ever says  blank  ?”, I’m going to tell them  blank !” My response shocked me at first, then I realized that I had an eerie sense of peace about telling her the truth. No candy-coated message about how she’ll never have to worry about death or that when the time comes, Angels will seize her and carry her off into the clouds never feeling the pangs of mortality.  Actually …maybe that is the way things will go down when her time comes.  But the peace I had has to do with a very simple truth…I believe in God.  I believe that what He says about himself to be true. That what He says He’ll do, He’ll do. If that - as a believer in Him - I live a life prescribed in the precepts He’s revealed and walk in the way in which He walked, I get eternal life. That’s the payoff. And the payoff far outweighs all the bogus promises of this world and can’t be compared to the life to come.   So when my three-year old asks me if she’ll die someday, I tell her “Yes Navah, you will. And as a child of God you inherit His Kingdom once you’ve passed on from this life to the next. This is our hope. This is our perspective in life. To see all things, including ourselves, as a creation of the Creator and our ultimate reconciliation with Him to be with Him, for eternity, where He intended us to be since the beginning."  At first I was fretful about her question, then I realized the answer that God provides was more for me. To realize the truth of my existence with the death of my loved ones and to understand that those slipping off of the list of the land of the living have received their promise in the Kingdom to come.  Lord, have mercy .

      My Father/Confessor sends us these daily  Wisdoms . Today's was especially good.   MY DEAR SPIRITUAL SONS AND DAUGHTERS:   I came across this archived article by radio commentator, Dennis Prager.  Prager is an observer of American culture and often has interesting insights.    If you live in a culture you will be influenced by that culture.  As Orthodox Christians we want to avoid being co-opted by that culture.  With that thought in mind, I hope you get something helpful from this article.    Remember also that your children are even more influenced by the culture in their schools and w/their peers.  I encourage you, as parents, to help them learn to think and make moral and spiritual decisions...    It's the heart versus the Bible   - Dennis Prager (archive)  I recently interviewed a 26-year-old Swedish student about her views on life. I asked her if she believed in God or in any religion.  "No, that's silly," she replied.  "Then how do you know what is right and wrong?" I asked.  "My heart tells me," she responded.  In a nutshell, that's the major reason for the great divide within America and between America and much of Europe. The majority of people use their heart -- stirred by their eyes -- to determine what is right and wrong. A minority uses their mind and/or the Bible to make that determination.  Pick almost any issue and these opposing ways of determining right and wrong become apparent.  Here are three examples.   Same-sex marriage:  The heart favors it. You have to have a hard heart not to be moved when you see many of the loving same-sex couples who want to commit their lives to one another in marriage. The eye sees the couples; the heart is moved to redefine marriage.   Animal rights:  The heart favors them. It is the rare person, for example, whose heart is not moved by the sight of an animal used for medical research. The eye sees the cuddly animal; the heart then equates animal and human life.   Abortion:  How can you look at a sad 18-year-old who had unprotected sex and not be moved? What kind of heartless person is going to tell her she shouldn't have an abortion and should give birth?  The eyes and the heart form an extraordinarily powerful force. They can only be overcome when formulating policies by a mind and a value system that are stronger than the heart-eye duo.  With the decline of Judeo-Christian religions, the heart, shaped by what the eye sees (hence the power of television), has become the source of people's moral decisions.  This is a potentially fatal problem for our civilization. As beautiful as the heart might be, it is neither intellectually nor morally profound.  It is therefore frightening that hundreds of millions of people find no problem in acknowledging that their heart is the source of their values. Their heart knows better than thousands of years of accumulated wisdom; better than religions shaped by most of the finest thinkers of our civilization (and, to the believer, by God); and better than the book that has guided our society -- from the Founders of our uniquely successful society to the foes of slavery to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and most of the leaders of the struggle for racial equality.  This elevation of one's heart is well beyond self-confidence -- it is self-deification.  One of the first things you learn in Judaism and Christianity is that the eyes and heart are usually terrible guides to the good and the holy. " . . . (D)o not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined to whore after" (Numbers 15:39); "the heart is deceitful above all things . . . " (Jeremiah 17:9).  Supporters of same-sex marriage see the loving gay couple, and therefore do not interest themselves in the effects of changing marriage and family on the children they do not see. And since they venerate their hearts, the biblical ideal of male-female love, marriage and family is of no significance to them.  Animal rights supporters' hearts are deeply moved by the animals they see experimented on, not by the millions of people they do not see who will suffer and die if we stop such experiments.  Likewise, the hearts of the people who support PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) are so moved by the plight of slaughtered chickens that the organization has a campaign titled "Holocaust on your plate," which equates our slaughtering of chickens with the Nazi slaughtering of Jews.  For 25 years I have been asking high school seniors across America if they would save their dog or a stranger first if both were drowning. The majority has nearly always voted against the person. Why? Because, they say with no self-doubt, they love their dog, not the stranger. An entire generation has been raised with no reference to any moral code above their heart's feelings. They do not know, and would not care if they did know, that the Bible teaches that human beings, not animals, are created in God's image.  So, too, those who cannot call any abortion immoral are moved by what they see -- the forlorn woman who wants an abortion, not by the human fetus they do not see. That is why abortion rights groups are so opposed to showing photos of fetuses that have been aborted -- such pictures might move the eye and the heart of viewers to judge the morality of many abortions differently.  It is undeniable that many people have used their minds and many have used the Bible in ways that have led to evil. And some of these people have been truly heartless. But not one of the great cruelties of the 20th century -- the Gulag, Auschwitz, Cambodia, North Korea, Mao's Cultural Revolution -- came from those who took their values from the Bible. And the great evil of the 21st century, though religion-based, doesn't come from the Bible either.  Meanwhile, the combination of mind, Judeo-Christian values and heart has produced over centuries the unique success known as America. Reliance on the heart will destroy this painstaking achievement in a generation.

       Metrophanes, 1st Patriarch of Constantinople   A strange thing is happening with my car stereo.   I’ve been listening to the New Testament on CD for years. It’s replaced the  Christian  radio programming I’d been tuned into since becoming one myself and more significantly from the time when a dear  urlLink brother  revealed to me that Hank Hanegraaff, J. Vernon McGee and Chuck Missler aren’t Orthodox.    There I go again thinking all Christians are Orthodox . I guess common sense would have told me names like Hanegraff and McGee aren’t  Russian . Underline “common sense”.  Anyway, so I’m popping in the different Gospel accounts, St. Luke’s book of Acts, even the Apocalypse when I’m feeling frisky, all the while never distinguishing which Scripture is which or making mental highlights to revisit those passages that strike particular theological/inspirational chords once I’ve returned home.  This kind of made me feel weird. On the one hand, if I had to be stuck in gridlock what better way to pass the time than to listen to the Bible on compact disc. On the other, it is Holy Scripture and to reverence it like it’s the latest Death Angel release didn’t seem appropriate either.  No worries though, apparently God has handled this challenge.   For the past 3 months the eject button on the CD player hasn’t worked and consequently I’ve nearly committed to memory the last two chapters of Hebrews and all the epistles of Sts. James, Peter, John and Jude!   Glory to God in all things .

      On this day, the patron to my wife, I offer some tidbits about the life of this amazing woman.   From last Sunday’s bulletin:   The Venerable Irene of Chrysovalantou is a much revered monastic saint of our Holy Orthodox Church. Born in Cappadocia in the ninth century, Irene was said to have been a woman of striking beauty. She was to show, however, her real beauty was in her desire to dedicate her life to the Lord. Irene was so attractive that she was once summoned to Constantinople by the Emperor, who had sent royal emissaries throughout the Empire to find a suitable bride for Prince Michael. On her way, she was granted permission to visit the hermit Ioannikios on Mt. Olympus, who prophesied that rather than becoming the bride of a future emperor she would become the handmaid of the Lord. His prophecy came true, for when Irene reached Constantinople, the Prince had already selected another to be his bride.    Irene entered a monastery at Chrysovalantou, where even as a novice, she distinguished herself with her strong spiritual character. A prolific reader, Irene once read of a monk who prayed from sunset to sunrise for three years. She was given permission to attempt the same ascetic feat, and while everyone doubted the stamina of this young nun, Irene was able to fulfill her goal, fasting severely in the process.  Eventually, Irene became the Abbess of the Chrysovalantou Monastery. Through the centuries, scores of miracles are credited to her by those who pray for her intercession.   "Holy Saint Irene, well pleasing to God, pray that He may grant us mercy, life, health, peace, salvation, visitation and a pardon and remission of our sins when He comes to judge the living and the dead."  Happy name day ‘Isi.

      My brother and I were up late the other night chatting up various topics of concern. Throughout our discussion we covered civil and personal rights, history, the state of affairs in the U.S. with regards to the upcoming presidential election, apathy in America and the post war efforts in Iraq. He’s genuinely interested in finding the truth about most things, Christianity included. As a result of our conversation, I came to the conclusion, that only one thing matters in this world…   Souls .
