        Dad      I look down at the hands I've used For forty-something years, And see the man who picked me up When I ran home in tears.   I look down at the legs that I walk out on every day, And see the feet I'd stand on, dancing, While the music played.   I look out on the new day With the same old blue-gray eyes, I used to see light right up Over me, with love, and pride.   I look up in the mirror At a face I recognize, So much like the one I've known 'Long as I've been alive.   We are so much alike, and now, I don't think it's all that bad. From baby to child to boy to man, I've always loved you, Dad.   -Drew Engman

At 8:30 pm on Friday July 16th 2004 my dad Andy Engman died peacefully in his sleep at Knolls West Convalescent Hospital in Victorville, CA. He had a long, incredible, full, and complete life.   I just read he won a Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Golden Award in 1985 for his lifetime contributions to the art of animation.  urlLink http://us.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Motion_Picture_Screen_Cartoonists_Awards/1985   Here is the obituary we are putting in the Burbank papers this Sunday August 1st 2004:  Andrew Alfons Engman, "Andy"  Andy Engman was born 11/21/11 in Vasa, Finland.

His family writes: Andy immigrated to the the Bronx NY USA at age 15 from Finland. He went to California in 1937 where he began his 35 year career as an animator at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank California. He and Elsie lived on Florence Street (between Magnolia Blvd. & Clark St.) in Burbank for 27 years, where they raised their 5 children. He was involved in the Boy Scouts of America (Leader Troop 115 out of Toluca Lake), Kiwanis (Keynote speaker), and PTA (Lifetime member). He won several awards for his contributions&nbsp;to animation arts as part of the Disney team, and many trophies, plaques, certificates, and other acknowledgements from all the other organizations which he volunteered so much time and creativity towards.   Andy was a kind and gentle man. He had a great artistic talent in animating, sketching, caricaturing, and painting. He entered many local art shows and contests and won numerous awards for his land and seascapes and his unique driftwood art made from found objects along the west coast beaches. Andy was patriotic and always flew the American Flag.&nbsp;In earlier retirement years (1972-1980) he traveled the United States and the world with his wife Elsie. He lived a full, productive, fun life.  There will be a celebration of life memorial service on Saturday, August 21 at 1pm at Andy's home 9976 Mountain Rd. Pinon Hills CA 92372.

      Headaches (When you'ld rather not turn the other cheek)  It wasn’t quite freezing and it wasn’t quite midnight But it felt cold and it was dark. I was old and needed a spark, and Nothing came easy and nothing seemed right.  I blamed me, and you, and them,  But truth be told, it’s a little of each. We all stretch, and we all reach, Playing that same old game again.  God, sometimes I want to tell her off, And put them in their place, But making a scene would be a disgrace, It’d all end up for naught.  I’m fighting for my soul here, In case you didn’t notice. A frost blew in to coat us, How’d the world turn out so weird?  Wrong is right and right is wrong, If I don’t agree with them! Why do I pretend? This has gone on much too long.  But the answer’s not “Get in their face,”  Any fool could tell you that A wise man doesn’t tip his hat Or take steps he can’t retrace.  Like it or not, it’s not our right To demand a thing from love. We’ll forgive and pray that that’s enough And surrender our side of the fight.

      (Think: tribute to our fallen idols and appreciation and love for my family in recovery.)    Eleventh Hour    I'll always miss those magic moments Stolen in my misspent youth Nights of almost holy torment Spent believing lies for truth.   Left in disillusioned ruins To be played out on guitar Songs as old as fallen angels Coming down like shooting stars.   Landing hard on my naive heart I just assumed my pain was part Of how I'd have to live my life now Like a ghost that won't depart.   But in the bright stage lights and barrooms Turned up loud and stoned as hell I tried to sing and play my soul out As if more poison makes you well.   So many years of fog and feedback Hidden in a mushroom cloud Lost and left in desolation To the cheering of the crowd.   Until one day it was over And I limped away, undone By all the years of self-indulgence That I used to think was fun.   Now what's left of me recovers What I can of all the days Left to count the cost of choices And debts I can't repay.   I've learned most things the hard way Slowly earned back self-respect, for  Once the Grace of God's accepted What He will, He'll resurrect -   ...Now I can live with that.   - Drew Engman
