      Last night was the BBQ and movie night. I didn't make it through. Once again, I started strong but fatigue hit me at some point. I think the problem is I need to eat right before I go to these things since the food prep takes hours and I'm hypoglycemic. By the time some food was ready, I was too weak to fight the crowds to get a plate of food. Wally brought me some of Anthony's corn on the cob (yum!) and I snuck some potato and mac salad from the kitchen. That gave me enough strength to walk to the car so Wally and Geoff and I could go home. Wally wasn't feeling well either last night.  I was hoping to go get a car today, but Wally and Geoff, despite their determination to not stay up all night, played Xbox games until 5:00 A.M. Since Wally has practice later and then the gig, I guess I have to wait until tomorrow...And couch shopping will have to wait even longer.

      WEEE! It's that time again. Art Department's International Art Competition is underway! Voting begins August 1st. The digital&nbsp;category is nice this year, but since they began charging an entry fee, there is much less of it. It's been a few years since I placed in this competition and I'd really like to&nbsp;place&nbsp;this year. I see a lot of traditional PS stuff, and some crap, but also a few that are just beautiful. I'm so glad they allow you to vote for five images! I encourage everyone to vote. And vote in all categories if you have time! It's a great competition.    urlLink http://www.artdept.com.au/contest04/digital.asp &nbsp;Mine is&nbsp; #428

      Everyone is now eating downstairs. I had started off alright, but as the evening progressed and dinner got further away, the heat in the room was building and combined with the crowd factor it became&nbsp;overwhelming. Between my PMS and the Hypoglycemia kicking in, I began to feel disconnected and well, downright miserable. Around 9:30 I came upstairs to cool off. Dinner was served around 10:45, but I didn't have the physical or mental energy to join everyone again. Poor Mike must be exhausted. He began cooking around 6:30. We&nbsp;put&nbsp;every fan in the house into the living room and kitchen. I swear this AC is still not working properly. And we're still getting the $350.00 dollar electricity bills. So I'm going to drop Nicklin a line again and have them check the AC one more time.  Anyway, I'm just sitting up here wondering if I should take a Lortab on an empty stomach. My CT is acting up&nbsp;again&nbsp;so I'm searching for a cheap Wacom pad on eBay...

      I got a response from Amazon. They say some wish lists have been going haywire lately. But that wouldn't explain the book that was added. So I started thinking really hard about how that book could have&nbsp;ended up in my wish list if not by some mean person. Is it possible that I had at one time added the book to my list because everyone around me kept telling me I was a Hypochondriac? I do not remember anything like this, mind you. But I have to keep all possibilities in check. After all, I have the memory of a bottle cap nowadays! Still, it doesn't seem likely that I'd give in to the badgering and believe I was a Hypochondriac after a decade of being ill, with mega doctor files to prove it...

      I debated on whether I'd even post about this, but why not?   I logged onto my Amazon wish list again to purchase something from it, and what do you know? Someone deleted everything except for the heating pad. How do I know it wasn't just a mistake on Amazon's part? Because there was now a book about overcoming Hypochondria. Someone's way of making a point, or perhaps just mocking me. Either way, I've gone through and updated the wish list with a new password.   As I was redoing my wish list, Wally came into the bedroom. I presumed he was done gaming. He looked in at me real quick and then turned to go to the bathroom. This is completely normal. Though I did note he seemed to be very quiet. Still, I finished up my wish list within a few minutes and got up to ask him if he wanted me to start a bath. But the bathroom light was still off. He was nowhere in the room. So I shouted down to him as he played his Xbox, and asked if he had just come up to the room. He said no and asked me why... My guess is that one of our ghosts wanted to check in on me because I was kind of sad and miffed. I feel so much better now! I got to see my first apparition, but without any fear. Nothing but calm here.

      ...though I really shouldn't have to!   I am now receiving Partial Disability payments which means while I cannot hold a full time job, I am  encouraged  by the state to work part time, which I do - Freelance Photographer.   I was granted disability on the very first application, which is practically impossible unless you are blind or missing limbs. It is  standard procedure  for&nbsp;most applications to be rejected the first time. That should tell you I have a legitimate case.    The reason I am defensive  is I've been mentally and physically ill for about a decade now and I've heard nothing but "it's all in your head", "you just want attention", "you're just lazy", "you look healthy to me", "grin and bear it", etc... So I worked as best I could. And just before my nervous breakdown I was working full time plus overtime for nearly four years at a job so stressful that I doubt a lot of you reading this could do it much longer, if at all. So I absolutely do not want to hear anymore bullshit about me being lazy or being "weak" spirited. Anyone who thinks that way of me, say so now because I do not need you in my life. There's the door.     P.S.  I hope I haven't offended any of my friends by overreacting. I just wanted to clarify that I am still considered a hypochondriac by most of my family. I prefer to surround myself with friends who are supportive, and who understand. I&nbsp;don't want&nbsp;people to feel sorry for me, just to know the truth. I consider you guys my family now. :)

      The Frog was fun, but noisy and a bit warm. There was a Poker Tournament upstairs, but Adam said we could hang out up there since we needed space for our big group. Iceborg will have a few photos to post. The Frog accidentally charged me 5 times. I know it will get cleared up, but in the meantime it ties up the rest of my money. I'm at 61 cents so if anything comes through I'll have bank fees, and the Frog will have to pay them. *shrug* I have a sore throat now. I'm going to have to stop "casually" smoking again.   Below are a couple of pix from Sunday night after the garage sale. Wasn't in full photo mode, as I was really exhausted.

      I finally got hold of someone in the correct office of Animal Control. They are sending an officer to the address ANONYMOUSLY to warn the owners to leash their dog. Those idiots apparently don't watch Animal Precinct! If they did they'd know that they can have the dog taken away and possibly go to jail.

      OMG. FINALLY! Paulette from Ensign's office just called to let me know that my case did finally go through on the 21st. I should be receiving back payment any day now and each month I'll be receiving my check as expected. PHEW! Finally! I can get a car and a cell phone and be normal again! *sigh of relief*  When Zoe gets back and finally gets her stuff into her new place, Wally and I will be able to clean like we've wanted and get new furniture! August should be the beginning of a new life. I'm very excited about moving forward.  Heather and I will be going to Hollywood for a weekend getaway. I'm really looking forward to it.   I can breathe again!

      I forgot to mention that everyone donated their "leftovers" from the sale to Safe Nest. A worthy cause. Jenny worked (if I remember correctly) for them, Bob volunteered with them, and I interviewed for a position there&nbsp;last year, as well. And Bob and Jen donate to them monthly. I donate whenever I do a round of super cleaning/organizing, too.&nbsp;We agreed it was the best place, especially since Jenny had an enormous amount of clothes to donate.   John Ensign's office called again. I'm so tired and I've already forgotten her name, but she's so helpful. Anyway, she said SS told her that I'm already receiving my money. I explained that I do recieve SSI (temporarily) but that I am  also  supposed to be receiving $833.00 a month as of last October for SSD. She's calling them back now. The people in the local&nbsp;SS office must be MORONS! GAH!   I'm off to do some much needed laundry and to clean up now that we have less stuff. The one problem with cleaning is my new vacuum cleaner broke! I'm so glad I opted for the 2 year warranty!

      The garage sale was a complete success. We got rid of lots of crap and raised nearly $300.00 for the Bowerbanks. Every little bit helps! It was very hot, but we had a great time. Many thanks to all involved and those who purchased stuff, as well as donated a little extra cash to the fund. Even Iceborg was able to make it out and pitch in! What a great guy. Honestly, this was a really good experience. I feel very good right now, other than the fact that I need a bath in the worst way! ;)   After the sale, a bunch of us ordered Thai food and hung out. Rock!   Tonight I was chased for the second time by the Pit Bull from a few houses down. I am forced to&nbsp;swoop up&nbsp;Sparky, who&nbsp;thinks he can take this massive creature,&nbsp;and make a mad dash for our back door. This time I was a few seconds ahead of the bastard, but yesterday I literally slammed the door on this dog's face. The dog stayed at our door, barking through the glass at Sparky, who was barking back. I finally just took Sparky upstairs until the dog gave up and went home. So tonight Wally called Animal Control and left a message. Tomorrow I'll make sure&nbsp;someone comes out&nbsp;and warns the owners to leash their dog. These idiots&nbsp;just open their door and let him out, and then open the door for him whenever he decides to come back. That's fucking irresponsible and highly dangerous. The dog obviously wants to eat my dog, and I'm in danger since I'm&nbsp;going to protect him. One chomp and little Sparky would surely die.&nbsp;People&nbsp;can be so&nbsp;ignorant. It's sad.

      Today was successful and interesting. Tomorrow we hope to unload even more. A lot of what people don't sell they are taking to a charity after we close up. Me, I'm keeping or selling most of what I don't sell, as it is pretty much fun toys and such that are left on our table.  It never ceases to amaze me what people will buy at a garage sale. Everyone laughed at me because I had an unopened box of cotton swabs on the table for a quarter. It was one of the first items sold! It also freaks me out that other garage sale people go around ripping up garage sale signs so that everyone comes to their sale only. That's just rude!  I just woke up from an hour long nap. Wally is still napping and will probably nap a long time. It's very hot outside. Tomorrow we are only open till 2:oo (unless the customers keep coming) so it shouldn't be so bad.

      Sparks is getting much better. Today Wally bought him one of those long, retractable leashes in hopes of Sparky getting the poop-outside thing. It worked! He just needed more privacy!  He loves to look out our back door. I took a photo because it was cute, but also because he looks so much like Ramses... Funny, the doors and carpet are even similar!   urlLink     Sparky (left) Ramses (right)

      I've been "toying" with the idea (*groan*) of selling off my vampire toys one by one in order to replace them with ghost toys. I'm not sure if I want to do this yet, and it would be a lot of work if I did. The vampires cost me a lot of money and time to collect, but if slowly was building up a cute ghost collection in place of it, it might be fun. (Wish I hadn't given away most of the ghost toys I already had!)   I could easily do this on eBay. I would take photos of groups at a time and post them. Selling them as&nbsp;one big&nbsp;group would never get me anything close to what they're worth to me. I mean, it would have to be at least $300.00 to make&nbsp;me feel OK about it&nbsp;and I really doubt anyone would want to pay that. I suppose I could try, though.   Just thinking out loud. Any thoughts from the peanut gallery?

      Last night we finally had Bob & Jen over for dinner. Since the roomies, Mike and Zeb, were both home and both feeling crappy, we asked them to join us. We had Wally's yummy chicken stuffed Portabellos and Filet Mignon, along with his Ginger Carrots and some other goodies. It was so yummy and I was starving. Bob and I finished our plates about the same time! *blush* Zeb had been gracious enough to pick up this kick-ass Tiramisu from the nearby Italian deli. I think everyone enjoyed the meal.  Afterwards, we all played the DVD version of Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit. Zeb & Mike won. Came from behind and won, I should say! Damn that roll-to-get-back-on-the-center rule! Wally and I kept getting there and then blowing our answer. Too much wine?  Today I cleaned the kitchen and dishes, and found Sparky in the garbage eating bits of the chicken wrapper. Ugh. Now he'll probably be sick. I can't wait till I have some money so I can buy all new lidded garbage cans!  Tonight is the garage sale meeting. Everyone else should be bringing their junk. Mishie brought hers yesterday. We exchanged a few things that we needed/wanted. Believe me, there is soooo much stuff to sell we'll still have plenty of money to contribute to the Bowerbanks. Zoe already grabbed (via chat) a couple of my things as well. Heh. Exchanging stuff is fun!  That's about it for now. I'm feeling pretty good today, mentally. Rawk!

      I took a much needed nap (I've not been getting more than a few hours of sleep a night lately) and that has calmed me down. Though, the headache I started getting before is still lingering. I've got this horrible feeling something is wrong, but it's probably just stress.   Earlier today I got to meet Mike's daughter. She's an incredible kid. I like her a lot. Sparky loves her bunches too. He got a good playin' in. I feel really shitty because I was trying to help Mike figure out why his camera wasn't focusing and I accidentally deleted whatever photos he still had on the camera! Damn, I suck maaaaaaaa- jor.

      The answering machine died and a lightbulb blew out in the laundry room, so now I want to kill.&nbsp; I hate this fucking three story nightmare-house. Changing all the lightbulbs is a pain in the ass, the electricity bill is a fucking joke, and cleaning it is&nbsp;absolute fucking hell. Seems like I clean every single day and it's still a shambles.   I swear to god everything was great yesterday. Why did everything suddenly get icky again. I'm so sick of  feeling . I wish I was numb. I'm ordering some Xanax, despite the whole addictive factor. I'll just try not to take it more than a couple of times a week. I can't live like this. I can't keep feeling or I'll go insane and take everyone along with me.   I guess maybe Wally was right. I need to get the fuck away from here. Not because it will strengthen our relationship, but because I need a break from&nbsp;EVERYTHING. Let&nbsp;someone else&nbsp;take care of the cleaning, the puppy, the cats, the fish...

      Time to plan my escape. Actually, it's not an escape. I'm just taking a mini-me vacation at the suggestion of a certain someone. Hopefully I will be going to stay with Heather, but possibly I'll be going to the Excalibur for a few nights, alone. I suppose it will be good for me -to gain some perspective on my life. If I got to the hotel I will get a massage, work-out in their gym, etc...get some good me time. But I can't do it until I get my disability payment though. Heather has offered her place and her company&nbsp;to me several times in the past year, so I'm hoping this is a convenient time to take her up on that offer. I could use some Heather time. Girlie time, with someone who understands me so well. That could be useful.

      Zeb hubbed Wally and my computers, which is great since Sparky chewed through Wally's cord last night!  &nbsp;  Chatted with Mike and Zeb over "breakfast" downstairs. That's always nice.  &nbsp;  Found a few more things for the garage sale over the last few days. Makes for more money for us and more for the Bowerbanks. Plus Heather said she'll try to come by and donate some stuff.  &nbsp; Danielle is improving. &nbsp;  Not So Also's MySpace profile is up to something like 60 friends already.  &nbsp;  Patience is back in touch with me.  &nbsp;  Weight is coming off, which means I will get in shape rather quickly once I get to the gym.  &nbsp;  I'm feeling positive about myself again despite being a bit worn out physically.  &nbsp;  Been doing a lot of organzing and cleaning, can't wait to finish the house and ready it for its makeover. Though the&nbsp;painting will be a lot of work, I am&nbsp;excited to at least get ready for it. Having things clean and organized makes me feel so much less tense.  &nbsp;  Sparky is calming down a bit, and next month he gets fixed - so he'll be much calmer.  &nbsp;  I've done everything I can in my disability case. I have to believe that it will be resolved soon. And when it finally is, I'll have enough to get&nbsp;a nice&nbsp;car, a cell&nbsp;phone, join the gym, have my photo show at the Coffee Bean,&nbsp;and give some money every month&nbsp;to Wally so that he can open his savings/401K.   &nbsp;  Things really could be a lot worse. I just have to focus on the positive.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       20 things you have to believe to be a Republican today.   &nbsp; 1. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.  &nbsp; 2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.  &nbsp; 3. Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on individuals who use marijuana to relieve the pain of illness.  &nbsp; 4. "Standing Tall for America"; means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.  &nbsp; 5. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.  &nbsp; 6. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.  &nbsp; 7. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.  &nbsp; 8. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.  &nbsp; 9. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  &nbsp; 10. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our longtime allies, then demand their cooperation and money.  &nbsp; 11. HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart.  &nbsp; 12. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  &nbsp; 13. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  &nbsp; 14. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.  &nbsp; 15. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  &nbsp; 16. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  &nbsp; 17. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.  &nbsp; 18. You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to adopt.  &nbsp; 19. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.  &nbsp; 20. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.

      I don't know why but my body is racked with anxiety or panic. It's that restless feeling that spreads out through the whole body and feels almost like your nerve endings are frayed. I can't stop tossing and turning, and since I don't want to disturb Wally I'm&nbsp;here at the computer instead of in bed. I took a sleeping pill and when that finally knocks me out I'll go back to bed. I hate when this happens because&nbsp;I don't have Xanax anymore. It's an awful feeling.

      Last night Wally and I had dinner at the Feast in Sunset Station. Pretty good as far as buffets go. We then went to the arcade before seeing a movie. I actually won a couple of games of Tekken and some Air Hockey. Yay me! I was laughing during&nbsp;the Air Hockey. We actually ahd a lot of fun with it. Made me want to buy one and put it downstairs.&nbsp;But boy was my arm tired after all that. We saw Anchorman, which was slightly disappointing. You can read Wally's review at:  urlLink http://www.my-diary.org/read/?read=116113  &nbsp; &nbsp; Just now I went to take Sparky out, but couldn't because some lady is sitting in my chair in our yard. I wouldn't even begin to know what to say to her, as it's not really our property. The walkway behind the townhouses is pretty much public. So for now Sparky will have to either wait or use the balcony. He won't do anything if someone is out there because all he'll care about is meeting that person. I don't really want to strike up a conversation with a stranger right now, especially one so bold as to sit in a chair on someone elses' porch. People are annoying. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I've been working on promoting the band and their site today. I created accounts at MySpace and added the website&nbsp;to multiple search engines. If Geoff can add a meta tag to the page, it will definitely help the searches.  &nbsp;  Can you believe Yahoo, MSN, and Lycos all do not accept URL submissions? If you don't pay for it, you won't be found. I'm hoping the meta tag stuff solves that, because a lot of idiots use those engines instead of something like Google.  &nbsp;  I'm going to Friendster now to create yet another account and add a gazillion friends...Ciao!

      I was restless tonight as Wally and Geoff were playing the XBox and I had nothing to do. I finally went through the stuff under the stairs, but I had to move Zoe's stuff to get to it. I couldn't help it, I needed to do it! Man, do I have a lot of cool stuff to sell at the garage sale. I tagged it all and put it in the garage. Then I hit the kitchen. I went through all the cabinets (except the one designated for the Zs) and threw out all the old food, as well as combined any opened duplicate items. Wally thought he was out of certain herbs and spices when in reality there are&nbsp;two or three of some things. I was able to make a whole bunch of room and then organize everything better. I'm exhausted but I feel good having done something productive.  &nbsp; We ran over to Wal Mart earlier and bought a child's gate. I couldn't wait any longer to get that one from Jeff. Sparky's poop was starting to get soft and light colored again and I couldn't risk him eating any more cat poop. I don't need another vet bill, nor the mess! The gate was only $22.00 so we went ahead and got it. &nbsp; Wally's parents are getting rid of all three dogs now. I wish I could convince them just to keep their original dog, Biff. But their daughter somehow convinced them that if they get rid of one they need to get rid of them all. I don't understand that, personally. I mean, why not just get rid of the one she asked them to take care of since he's not their dog and he causes fights with the others? And Goldie is very big and hyper, but she's new, so get rid of her too. But Biff is a quiet, small dog who they've had for years. I don't get it. He's really no trouble and this year they spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get him well after an illness. So why give him up now? *shrug* If anybody wants a male Lhasa Apso, a large female&nbsp;mix (gorgeous blonde&nbsp;dog), or an older male Poodle you should let me know ASAP! Free to good homes... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I will have to wait until my disability comes in to join. When did these things get so pricey? I will probably be joing LVAC instead of 24 Hour Fitness. 24 Hour Fitness seems very expensive. I'll have to wait and see. There's just no way I'm paying more than $100.00 to join and $20.oo a month. That seems obscene in itself! But 24 Hour Fitness wants nearly $200.00 to join and $32.00 a month. EEK. I remember the days when you could join for like $40.00 and pay $20.oo a month. *sigh*&nbsp;I'll keep looking... Maybe I'll just buy a used treadmill and put it in the basement.

      Last night Wally and I went to see Darin's band Fueled By Failure at the Cooler Lounge. Afterwards we stopped off at the Frog to see Zoe off properly. Was a decent night out. &nbsp; Today I got my check from Ascend that I had forgotten about. It's only $100.00 but it means I can join the health club right away and have some breathing room in my account until the 1st. &nbsp; Zeb and Mishie are going to see I, Robot. We're considering joining them. It's really up to Wally. I know how beat up he feels. &nbsp; I stopped to get gas on the way to Nathan's. It's amazing&nbsp;what little gas&nbsp;nine dollars will get you these days. Grrr. By the way, Danielle seems to be doing better. Phew.

      Everything went great at the vet today. Sparky is doing good and has the energy to prove it. I stopped off at KFC on the way home to pick up dinner for Wally and myself. They filled the cup too high so I spilled Dr Pepper on myself and the truck. It's hard to deal with that while driving and holding onto a puppy. Still, not a big deal. I get home, we eat, Sparky gets into the garbage which I haven't taken downstairs yet. I&nbsp;crazily&nbsp;chase him around, thinking he's got a chicken bone. Turns out it was a piece of toast. So I decide I better take that garbage down and out to the curb. On the way down the stairs I completely miss a step and give myself a jolt. Not a bad fall or anything, but just enough of a shock to really piss me off. I yelled the f word so loudly that Zoe came out of her room to check on me.  &nbsp; I'm calm now, but I'm exhausted. I still need to go take care of Eliza for Nathan and then Wally and I have plans to possibly go to the Frog as well as see Darin's other band play. Right now my baby is sleeping. Actually, both of my  urlLink babies are sleeping. &nbsp;We'll see what happens. I know we're both internalizing some major stress. But going out would be good to relieve some of that!

      Thanks to Zeb my computer has been cleaned up. Now if only I could choose a category for my photos at Zazzle without crashing the entire internet for everyone in the house! It seems odd that the upload of the photo wouldn’t cause a crash, but something as simple as choosing something from a menu would. Grrr.  &nbsp;  I’m so itchy from the peeling now. It’s driving me mad!  &nbsp;  Wally and I went to Red Lobster for a bite to eat. He often likes to eat Lobster when he’s stressed - Much like I eat chocolate when I am. Wait, what am I saying? I always eat chocolate!  &nbsp;  My weight has started to drop for no real reason other than maybe the walking I did over the weekend. It’s odd, but I’m not complaining. The only problem is now I’m losing my breasts which means I’ll have to do some exercises to keep them perky. Heh. Hopefully next month I can join 24 Hour Fitness. I say hopefully because I still haven’t heard back from Social Security. GRRR.

      My back is peeling now. At least most of the pain is gone now. &nbsp; I'm feeling a bit restless. I want to clean, but it's pointless to clean much until the Zs are out. I want to wash dishes but we're out of dishwasher detergent. So I'm doing laundry now that the water is back on. But I feel ancy. I want to go through my stuff and get it organized and ready for the garage sale. I'm bored, yet unmotivated. &nbsp; I accidentally hit "yes" on a pop up today and although I've run spybot s&amp;d, it is still not perfect. Plus I still have that Avenue A thing and some weird Lycos search bar in my taskbar that showed up a week or two ago. I cannot seem to get rid of this stuff. I think spyware programmers and those who use them&nbsp;should be punished by having their hands cut off. No shit.

      I started peeling today. Ick. Oh well. At least most of the pain is gone. I think if we weren't in the desert I may not have peeled. The dry air made it impossible to keep the burn moist. It honestly wasn't so painful while we were still in San Diego.

      Last night I was taking out the garbage and emptying the kitty litter box before Kris came to pick me up for dinner. I guess the sweat, heat and the material of my shirt didn't work well together because my back starting stinging. I had to wash it and have Wally apply lotion, which despite his soft touch felt like he was sanding my back. It hurt so bad my eyes teared up. Thankfully that worked well enough for me to go out to dinner.  Kris picked me up and we went to Fado. MMM. Corned Beef and Cabbage Boxtie. *drool* We talked, mostly she listened to me discuss all the drama that surrounds me. And there is a lot of it! It's quite entertaining for an outsider to hear. Much like soap operas. One example: I have a long distance friend that I have only loosely been in touch with over the last few years. I sent him a link to my blog yesterday and he reacted rather oddly. He scolded me, in a very condesending tone, for not keeping in touch and for making no real effort to be in his life, etc... I apologized though I didn't feel I needed to, but he wasn't having it. So by the third e-mail from him I was done. I stopped reading it in the middle and deleted it. I seriously don't need any more drama or reason to feel like a bad person. The guy is not the same person I knew years ago. Enough said.

      We’re back from our little trip to San Diego. It was a lot of fun, despite some of the bad moments and disappointing food. Let’s recap: (If you click the green links for photos, be sure to use your "back" button to come back.)  DAY 1 After a busy morning/afternoon, Wally and I set out for  urlLink San Diego . WEE! As we approach the general vicinity, we turn on 91X and drool over the goodness of a REAL radio station. After awhile I comment that listening to this station is almost like listening to my MP3 playlist! *dreamy sigh* All goes well and we check into our room and do nothing much more than sit in the hotel’s Jacuzzi and have some food at the local family restaurant next to the hotel on Hotel Circle. It’s not the best food in the world, but the place is close AND it’s 24 hours. We end up eating there a lot because we’re used to the 24 hour bit. Anyway, I embarrass Wally by talking loudly about not ever wanting to eat pets like dogs, cats, and horses. Hey, he brought up Turtle Soup! It all went from there. Later, in the hotel we play some Rummy - I kick Wally’s butt. (Which is cool because he kicked my ass hardcore in Slug Bug.)  DAY 2 Rise and shine! We’re off to  urlLink Old Town  to see the Whaley House and eat before we head off to the beach. At the  urlLink Whaley House , I am able to debunk most of the photos I’ve seen from visitors. They have a book of “ghost photos” that visitors have contributed, and the only ones that I find curious are two shots with “vortexes”. However, these could be created by bugs flying into the photo while the flash is going off. So I am somewhat disappointed. I do not get any interesting photos, other than just artistic. We ask the tour guide about the little girl running into a clothesline as Geoff had told us, but the tour guide explains that it is untrue, that the little girl died of eating ant poison and they don’t know if she died in the Whaley house or the other home. As for Geoff’s sister’s photo with the strange lighting, well I can see how it could have happened but I am unable to recreate it due to the time of day. So it is still possible there was a presence there when Geoff visited.  Wally and I are hungry now, and pick the place which happens to be the place I’ve been to on my other two trips to Old Town. I remember that last time the food wasn’t so good, but I’m hoping they’ve gotten better because I’m starving. Three strikes, they're OUT. The food is horrible and I’m pretty sure the waitress has messed up my order. Wally and I are disappointed. As he’s waiting for the check I go to use the facilities. On my way out I see him, ready to go. He wants out and he wants out NOW. So we start walking back up to the car. On the street behind us I hear a police siren and think nothing of it, but then Wally mumbles “I didn’t pay”. Now I’m freaking out. I think he’s joking, but his tone is serious. “I’m not going to pay for that crappy food!” I’m shocked and nervous as I have never dined-and-ditched before, and after having just heard the police siren to boot… Eventually he laughs and says he’s joking. Ya got me, Wally! You got me good! It was believable because the food really was bad.  We hit  urlLink Mission Beach  and with my Rainbow Sherbert Sugar Cone we find a spot on the beach. Wally says it’s my imagination, but I’m sure people are staring and snickering at me. I wonder what is so strange about me. Wally puts on his sunscreen and hands me the bottle. I decide to only put some on my shoulders, arms, knees, and the bottom of my feet. Wally asks me if I’m sure this is a good idea. I, despite my own better judgment, seem to think I won’t get any color if I wear the sunscreen. Yes, I know this is stupid. Yes, I know that overcast days mean more burn. No, I don’t put the sunscreen on. *sigh* Wally questions me at least two more times during our stay on the beach, but I do not listen. And we all know what happens  urlLink when redheads don’t use sunscreen , right?  After the beach, we go  urlLink downtown  to eat. We’re walking around looking for a place, but I’m getting annoyed by the crowd and the blisters on my feet (should have worn tennies), not to mention the chaffing (should have worn pants instead of a skirt). Wally really wants Lobster so we decide to go to Max for the surf and turf. Too bad it costs $65.00! But we’re already seated and sipping drinks, so we order the Halibut and Lobster Ravioli. The food is decent, but not worth the price. Dessert, however, is to die for. I should have just ordered it first! The bill isn’t too horrendous. Back to the hotel for more Jacuzzi time, but not before turning onto a street where we are now on the Trolley tracks and a Trolley is headed straight for us, horn blaring! WEE!  DAY 3 Time for baseball! We drive out to  urlLink Petco Park  downtown to see the  urlLink Padres play the Rockies . This is only my second time at a real game, but this time I am not a bored kid. We get excellent seats in the shade, but with the breeze I am slightly chilled. Still, it’s not bad enough for me to have to buy anything expensive to wear over my bear arms. The game is great.  urlLink Padres win! Padres win!   As we’re walking through the parking lot to get to the truck, we are behind a group of richies. Wally is sure one of them is Paris Hilton. I say she’s just a wannabe, but yes, Paris would certainly wear high heels to a baseball game! The group gets into a very expensive Mercedes and drives off. Wally is still unsure. We drive out of the lot onto the busy street where Wally notices something really peculiar. Why, it’s  urlLink Santa Claus ! He must summer in San Diego!  We head back to  urlLink the beach  to shop, and Wally spies a nude sun-bather in her yard right on the boardwalk. I somehow miss her, but I’m certainly not interested enough to turn around and gawk at her. Heh. We stop in at Luigi’s for some food, where they serve the  urlLink biggest effin pizza ever ! On the way back to our room, Wally gets to hear the local music show on 91X and says he wants to move to SD just for the station and music scene. I agree.  DAY 4 As we’re getting ready to check out, we get a phone call from Nathan. He says Danielle is back in the hospital, so we cannot visit her and Jamie. This is not good news, but we try to make the best of our last day. We drive over the  urlLink bridge to Coronado  to snap  urlLink a few pix  of some of the views and dream about owning one of the beautiful homes. I feel at peace and wish I could live here. But it’s time to go. We stop at a small Chinese food place in SD to fill our bellies for the trip. We order way too much food. It’s pretty good, but nothing special. The waiter keeps insisting the shrimp will make it all the way back to Vegas if we take it to go. Uh, no thanks.  In Baker we stop to play Lotto and get into a bit of a fight due to misunderstanding and frustration. We are both very tired. But hey, if we win the lotto things will be better, right?   Home at last. We bullshit with Zeb and Mike and order some Chinese food. It’s nice to be home, but the heat is dreadful and so dry. I miss San Diego already.   Oh, and in case anyone ever doubts it -  urlLink Kris is cool . Geoff is  urlLink SOLID ! And there’s a lonely  urlLink street in SD on which nobody we know lives .

      So I start the day with ovarian cramps AND an IBS flare up. This is quite uncomfortable as I'm waiting at the Social Security office, but I manage to get through it. Unfortunately, the idiot from the local office whom I talked with on the phone yesterday didn't know what he was talking about. I'm back to square one. Nobody knows just how my file got so screwy and nobody knows how to FIX it. The man who helped me today was very nice and gave me his extension so I can call him back in a few days. He's going to ask the payroll department to overide the files, since he has no idea how to fix it. My file shows that I was born in the United States and have never had a passport, yet it says I don't qualify for disability benefits because I am not a citizen of the United States. ???? Go figure.  This is the first day of my vacation. *sigh*

      It's very early, too early. It's like 5:30 in the morning. Sparky woke me up, as usual. But on the bright side, I caught the very end of a  urlLink beautiful sunrise . I wish I had gotten up 10 minutes earlier, actually! In a few hours we will be getting up to start our day. We need to hit the bank, then I'm taking Wally to work, then going to the SS office to sort out my disability mess, then to get the truck washed, then back here to finish packing before picking Wally up from work and heading out of town. PHEW. Jeff is stopping by at some point to drop off the child's gate so that Sparky will no longer be able to get into the kitty litter box and eat the poop. BLECH. So it will be a busy morning, but by tonight we'll be in beautiful San Diego!

      I called the local Social Security office again to find out what the hell was going on. Turns out the reason I'm not getting paid is because they never saw my birth certificate, which is BULLSHIT. If they didn't, how did I receive Supplemental Income? And I'd also like to know why they couldn't tell me that until now! I've called four times in the last two months! What the hell??? So tomorrow I'm going to the SS office to show them my birth certificate and start receiving payments. GRRR. What the hell?

      Last night a huge group of us gathered at Krux's place to play Morgan's 7 Deadly Sins game. Jen made Stroganoff among other things, and Morgan cooked some tasty chicken. We ate like pigs, played the game all night, and then ate dessert like pigs and played some more. It was a great night!  After we came home, I was bending over to pick up some doggy doo when Sparky decided to leap up into my face, where he scratched my left eye. Luckily it didn't bleed like the time Avi scratched my right eye. Still, he definitely tore some tissue because this morning it still burns and there is a little globby bit sticking out. It's very small, but everytime I blink it makes my eye water. It still stings.  Today Zoe leaves for her trip to Canada. I have to do some laundry and start packing for my trip to Cali. Wally is worried we won't receive my parents' loan check in time. I did tell my step-dad when we were leaving and he insisted it would get here on time without special shipping. I couldn't very well argue with him since he's loaning me money, so we'll just have to hope that he's right.

      So as I'm getting ready to hop in the tub, I notice on our bathroom floor a bunch of tiny bugs. I can't tell what they are, but there are many and I'm thinking they might be a hatch of baby roaches. BLECH! I wanted to spray immediately but Wally said no. So I set down one of our ant traps and tried to forget about it. I can't sleep because I cannot stop itching now. After Wally goes to work I'm spraying the roach/spider/ant spray all over that bathroom. *shudder*  So now I'm awake and I don't know what to do with myself. I took an allergy pill and it will eventually help me sleep. In the meantime I'm kinda stuck with my racing thoughts. I cannot wait to get to the beach.

      A bunch of us gathered at the Frog tonight to say goodbye to Zoe before she leaves for Canada, and to cheer up Jenny who just lost her job. It was a large, festive crowd, but I was so fatigued that I could barely keep my eyes opened. Wally didn't go because his ulcer has been acting up. My poor baby is so stressed out over all the current situations and unknowns. So am I, actually. My IBS and Fibro have been flaring a lot.  Earlier today I did some carpet cleaning downstairs. Tomorrow I'll finish the level. I can't wait for our big community garage sale so we can get rid of all the crap and really clean this place up right. We're going to turn the basement into Mike's computer room as well as our storage area, but hopefully we won't have so much to store by then!   Speaking of computer stuff - Mike is planning on hooking the Zs up with some sort of wireless connection to Zoe's new house off of ours? Or maybe I misunderstood the conversation. If that's true, I personally think they should consult the Wally first. And considering the net has been crashing numerous times a day lately, I don't think it's a good idea. But what do I know?  I'm going to be paying rent starting next month, which will finally give Wally some breathing room money-wise. Hell, the elecricity bill is almost as much as half the rent! So this will definitely help.  OK, time for a bath.

      Sparky seems to like the balcony upstairs, and since I'm in this room a lot I think for now I'm going to let him out there when he needs to go. It's easy to clean up and much less stress on everyone. Maybe next month if things don't get better we'll sign him up at PetSmart for the training classes. They're not expensive.  So after whining about having no money, Jeff convinced me to write my Congressman. I wrote both of them! I doubt it will get me anywhere, but it's worth a shot! Here's what I wrote:  Dear Sir,  I was granted partial Disability payments months ago, but was told I could not receive the money because (they thought) I had been living out of the country. I have never been out of the country, I don't even have a passport. So the Social Security office told me they would investigate. However, I have now been without any income since May of 2003. I have been patient through the whole process - waiting six months before filing, waiting another six months for the decision, seeing appointed doctors, etc ... Now another two months have passed. In the meantime I lost everything. I had to declare bankruptcy and give up my car.  Each time I call the offices for information on their progress, I am told I just have to wait my turn. It has been well over a year that I have had no income, and I am at my wit's end. What can I do to speed up this process? It's their error and I am the one suffering.  Thank you so much for your time.

      So last night (this morning actually) my hands, wrists and arms start hurting. The pain became severe quite rapidly. I started a hot bath and as I began undressing I noticed my palms and wrists were - well, a frightening sight. It looked as though someone had taken a black pen and outlined all the veins. I started to cry and worry about future use of my hands. I know I've been doing much too much artwork lately. I was hoping the Wacom pad and pen would really help. And it does, but not the way I wanted it to. I really am going to have to back off of the art stuff.  Anyway, I got into the tub and yes, soaking my arms seemed to numb the pain. RELIEF. Sparky jumped into the water and I had a laugh. I was feeling better. But then Sparky jumped out of the bath and went to the door and proceeded to scratch it like a maniac. He hadn't scratched before the bath, so I figured his diarrhea must be acting up and I raced out of the tub to get dry and clothed so I could take him out. I let him out the door in case it was so bad that he needed to run downstairs and scratch on the back door, knowing that Wally was downstairs and could take him out if I didn't make it downstairs in time. Bad plan. When I was dressed I opened our bedroom door and found a pile. I then proceeded down the stairs where I found the entire dining/living room covered with a TRAIL of liquid shit. It was even smeared across the padded bench. It was on Zeb's magazines and the laptop bag that was left out. It was all around the floor of the entire level. As I was cleaning the pain in my hands/wrists came back. Unfortunately I have nothing stronger than Naproxen for the pain. I cried myself to sleep.

      We made it to Krux's party which was a blast. A bunch of us jokers splashed around in the pool for hours. It was great. What's even better is that I didn't look so bad in my new bikini. I guess all the running around after Sparky is counter-acting all the overeating. Hmm. I still want to join 24 Hour Fitness but I have to wait until next month now. Money is so damned tight. Ugh, I have water in my ears.

      Last night was AWESOME! Not So Also put on one of their best shows. The Cheyenne Saloon IS the place for bands to play. Great set-up, great sound, better turn-outs. Nice. I even ran into Dave and Jason (Mark's friends) there.  After my baby's set (they got to be first for once) Wally and I stuck around to see RX Theory. They are tight, but so not my bag. I was bored to tears despite their talent. So finally Wally and I left to buy me a swimsuit and then go eat over at Putters.  Today is Krux's bbq. Mark and Liz Z are in town so I'm going to invite them along! Yay!

      So not only did Sparky need to go to the vet, costing us money we needed for our mini-vacation, but today we had to replace three tires on Wally's truck. Now we're proper fucked. I borrowed money from my parents and he's borrowing a little from his, but we still may not have enough. This truly doth sucketh as we NEED this vacation DESPERATELY. If only the government would get around to fixing their error in my disability paperwork and SEND ME MY MONEY! GAR!  Last night Wally and Geoff went to the movies and so Mishie, myself and the Zs went to WalMart to find a new game to play. After much  urlLink goofing off in the toy aisles  (tee hee) we finally bought the new Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture DVD edition and a bunch of sugary things. Yo, Ding Dong. Ding Dong, yo. We had fun playing the game and Mishie won. I found it amusing that I was the only one who knew who performed I Wanna Kiss You All Over - by Exile. I even have it on my playlist because of Geoff and Wally and Happy Gilmore! Hee. Zeb's friend Ducky kept calling from some swingers party, complaining that he didn't have a date to swap! Since none of us was willing to "help him out" Zoe gave him some advice on picking up bimbos to take the party. We pondered his dilemma, since the guy is built, has an English accent, and just bought a new BMW (was it?). Picking up a chick should be CAKE!  Anyway, tonight is the Cheyenne Saloon show. I have a bad feeling about it. *sigh* I just hope some of the cool kids show up so we can just BS. I still have to go over to Nathan's before the show and check on the cat/house.  urlLink Meow.

      As usual my friends are awesome, despite my moodiness. Which actually makes me want to cry, but for different reasons. I'm feeling a lot better now but kind of worn.   I'm not sure who's doing what tonight. It's very play-it-by-ear right now, whether we like it or not. But we'll all find something to do, I'm sure. There's First Friday, which I miss going to but my legs wouldn't mind missing. There's the movies Wally wanted to take Geoff to see, but Geoff may not be able to go. Heather is out of town, methinks. Etc...  That's the update. Zeb just brought me a Kit Kat. A Kit Lafay Kat, to be precise. Mmm. S'good!

      I know everyone will bitch if I don't have a blog. So here it is. Weee.  Sparky has medicine and is feeling better.   I am going to get medicine for myself next month. (Made an appt with my psych.)It's no good hating myself and creating havoc 10 days out of every month. I refuse to do it to myself or my friends any longer. Meds it is.  Tonight I'm hoping to go out with Heather, if not I'm going to hoof it somewhere...Take a walk to the park with Sparky or something. Maybe see a movie over at the cheap theatre by myself. I wish I had my car.  There. Bored yet? You should be.

      Wally is gonna make sure I get my car. Joy! Squee! w00t!  Here is what I just added to my gallery at Zazzle. (I'm so disappointed.)   INFERIOR PRODUCTS:      Recently I received a shipment of black and white prints from Zazzle. They were light and green. If you have received any orders you feel are inferior please contact me.      Up until now I have been quite pleased with Zazzle. This new lack of quality concerns me and if Zazzle does not immediately correct the problem, I will be moving my gallery elsewhere.      I apologize for any inconvenience.

      I'm freaking out. I somehow miscalculated AGAIN (I hate buying large things) and since my disability check comes AFTER I want to buy the car on Friday, I'm going to be a couple hundred short. I'm gonna go cry now. I tried to get my PayPal money but they've still got my account screwy so I had to request a check, which takes 1-2 weeks. Grrr. I can't ask my parents, as I still owe them $300.00 from last month. I'm trying to figure out where else I can get like $100.00 by Friday. I don't know how I keep doing this to myself! I just want a car! Just a damned car! I guess I spent more on the couches and mattress than I really wanted to, but I thought I could just squeeze by. Drat. Squeezed a bit too close! Maybe my baby can front me until pay day...

      Yesterday Mishie came over to keep me company, bringing cookies and milk. Yay! We bullshitted till Wally came home. Then Wally cooked dinner and Mike and Mishie joined us. It was nice and relaxing. And the house looks much better with the new furniture!  After being dropped to the ground last night, Sparky's tail will no longer lift. I hope nothing is broken -I'll find out when he goes in for his other surgery in two weeks. He doesn't seem to be in much pain, but he can no longer wag his darling little nub.  I'm going to say this nicely, well nicely as I can during PMS, if you don't like dogs and my dog is bothering you, please just ask me to take him away. Several people have done things like drop him from heights or punch him in the face. These acts are unnacceptable, and if one more person does something like this I will not be able to maintain a friendship with that person. Accidents happen, but when they do I at least expect an apology. Often times I don't get one because the person involved carries a hatred of dogs. I have disdain for people who don't respect my pets. So, that said. Please be careful in the future. How you treat my dog directly correlates with what you think of me.  There, now I can go back to worrying about other shit, such as money and getting a car.  I'm tired. So tired. Back to bed on my new mattress...floating away...

      My great aunt Harriet died. Cousin Deidre let me know today. I am surprised the lady made it this far! What a woman! I loved our visits with Aunt Harriet. She was young at heart and could smile and laugh all day long.  Having not seen her in years upon years, I can at least say this is not painful. I am left with warm memories of Idaho picnics and Aunt Harriets toy box. :) Rest in peace, Harriet. You were a wonderful and wondrous woman.

      So Wally and I checked out the car today. *drool* She's exactly what I knew I could get for my money! And to think, Budget was trying to sell me a 94 Powder Blue Pontiac. *shudder* I paid the 20 bucks at Carfax for some peace of mind. Turns out the car is exactly as the owner explained. Nothing up his sleeves and he let me talk him down to my price! We're making the sale on Friday (hope hope) and I'm very excited!  The couches and mattress come today between 1 and 5. That is also exciting!  The only sad news today was that supplemental might want back their payments from July and August. GRRRR. Since I'm now on the disability, they say I don't need it. That's fine, but if I have to pay them back I'll be PEEVED. I'm going to call right now and find out what the dealio is. That's almost 700 bucks! DAMN THEM! Oh well. What can I do? I'll just have to make small payments if that's the case.

      I took a sleeping pill last night. At 8:30 A.M. the phone starts ringing and Andy makes me wake up to answer it. Of course whoever is there is not responding. He had thought it was the car guy, so I told him the car guy isn't calling until around 11:30. It might have been Walker calling about the couches. I hope not because if they say they couldn't get a hold of me and try to reschedule I'll choke the shit out of someone! Either way, I've been up for awhile and I'm having trouble walking. I'm dressed, but I'm going downstairs on the couch with the phone. If Walker calls, I'll hear it. I need to lie down. Can barely type. So slee-

      No luck with car shopping today, but I'm looking at a car tomorrow morning-ish that sounds perfect. If I can talk the guy down to 6100 then I'm set! The couches are being delivered tomorrow as well. Joy!  I cleaned out the downstairs room and moved a table in so Mike can set up his computer stuff down there. Yay! And now all the storage crap isn't crammed under the stairs, which hopefully means the cats will stop being spiteful and start using their litter box again. Things are starting to fall back into place. PHEW!  The last week or so I've been plagued with nausea. The fatigue comes and goes, and today I had chest pains. Grrr. I don't feel that stressed, but apparently it's internalized. Still, I know that in a few days/weeks I'll have everything I need. The car, new furniture, a clean/calm house, a cell phone, a gym membership, financial freedom, a photo show, etc...  I received a lovely e-mail last night from someone who stumbled across my artwork at SurvivorArt.com. Apparently I hadn't put four of the five pieces there on my own site! She wanted to buy them, so I uploaded them today. It's always flattering to receive those mails - they inspire me to keep trying for the book publishing. Knowing I'm reaching people is rewarding and invigorating!

      The show last night at the Double Down was spectacular! The crowd loved the guys, especially the chickies. Heh. Iceborg showed up, along with Nathan, Karen, Rook and Geoff. We had a great time, despite the fatigue that is plaguing me as of late. Ice had his camera so he got in a few snaps and I'm sure he'll post them on Zoe's site soon.  Today is car shopping! WEEE!
