      Okay, you say I'm a liar. You and I are the only ones that know that's a cover-up right now. Because you know the truth. Well, I must admit that I did promise you I wouldn't tell her, or anyone for that matter. So maybe that was a lie, or just a broken promise. Meh, it happens. But you lied to me when you told me that you told her, and you lied to her when you told her that it wasn't true after I told her the TRUTH. So now she thinks that I am the liar. But you know the truth. And the truth is that it happened. She said she'd forgive you. So why don't you just make it easier for both of us and let it be known. It happened, so just live with it.

      Yeah... I saw my therapist, Sandee, yesterday. I talked to her alot since I hadn't seen her in about a month. I told her about failing Government and breaking up with Josh, my problems with Jake and his problems with Kari. I got a lot of things figured out. I love Sandee. So then, I had Marching Band practice yesterday night. From 6:30 to 9 o'clock. Gee, that was fun. Marching around the Gymnasium floor, forward and backward, breaking to check my sections posture occasionally. Great stuff. Jake said not a word to me, and if that's the way he's gonna be, he might get himself into a little bit of trouble, or I might be okay with it. We'll see. And then tonight, I had music practice from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock. I GOT MY SHOW MUSIC! Yay. Yeah, Kari's a little sneak and got it before the rest of us. (Sorry Kari, I love you). But yeah...I have a concert in the Park next Thursday. That oughta be great fun. Ha! Well, Jake did say he wanted to call me on like Tuesday...so he would have called me Wednesday, but I received no such call. Maybe because my phone line was cut by the Jokinens, who are building a barn across the street from my house, and I didn't have a phone for half of the day. Could be it. And hey, guess what, guys? I might go into the NAVY! Woo-hoo! That'll be fun. Anyway...I g2g.

Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being  alone ?  I'll find someone new .  Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of - My heart is  crushed  by a former love. Can you  help me  find a way To carry on again?  Wish cast into the sky. I'm moving on. Sweet beginnings do arise. *She* knows I was wrong. The notes are old, They bend, they fold; and so do I to a new love.  Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being  alone ?  I'll find someone new .  Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of - My heart is  crushed  by a former love.

      La la la... I have gotten very little sleep. Sunday night, I had a "Senior Night" BBQ thingy at Angela Fortino's house...I got like 30 minutes of sleep. It was cool, we stayed up like all night playing "Truth or Dare". Yay, it was fun. Then, when I got home, I slept for about 4 hours, maybe a little more, and then I got ready for the "Senior/Freshman BBQ" at Mellissa Stout's house. I was there for a good 2 hours almost 3. I thought it was really BORING. So I was thinking about calling my mom. And then Jake showed up, so I decided to call my mom. I didn't know what his mood was or what his actions would be, so I didn't want a confrontation. But he ended up being nice to me. Lol. Yep. So now I'm home and reeeaaallly tired. So maybe I'll go to bed.

      I just got off the phone with Jake this morning. He makes me very angry. But Kari is a lucky girl. He cares about her more than anything. Sad thing is, lol, he promised me on his car that he wouldn't hurt me again...but now he won't give me his keys. Damnit. Well, I'm gonna be busy like-whoa all day. So call and leave a message or e-mail me: bazzberry@hotmail.com  Buhbye!

      You have to decide wether your life's falling apart. Can't you see where you should go? Now that you know deep in your heart. When will you believe? More than you see, all that I know. Could it be now is the time? Open your mind, where will you go? There is no such thing as fate. It's the decisions that you make that will determine just where you're going to be. But there's a choice that you can make, although you know it's hard to take. On the other side, you'll find the answer and see. With some determination, you'll change the situation from bad, to good, to the best.  -Kristelle N. Bentley

      Well, guys. What I didn't realize is that I'm an  OBSESSIVE FREAK . I was gone camping for  8  days and I called Jake  one  day out of  all  of those days. Yup, that makes me obsessive. Read his blog: www.jakeloveskari.blogspot.com  It'll knock your socks off to see what an  ASSHOLE  he really is. And to think, I liked him. Well, I think he just used me for someone to make-out with while Kari was gone. And to  Kari ...I apologize several times over for going out with Jake and causing you pain. Honestly I do. I'm glad that we could make up and be friends again. It's a great feeling to know now that you do not hate me. *Happy Face* But your boyfriend is another story. I honestly used to like him, and thought I still did after what he had done, but now I am not so sure. Talk to you all later.

       God Damnit!  Okay, I know that everyone who involves my bad mood reads this, so I'll let them have it.  JACOB  decided, while I was gone (I don't know the whole story...yet), to go back to Kari and  not  tell me. So I had to find out  myself  when I went to band practice last night.  KARI  talks about me during practice, but tries to hide it; I'm smarter than  that , young lady.  JOSH  is being a fucking dumbass, yeah, so he got a job, so what? Doesn't really make me think any higher of him after all, good for him though, glad he's happy. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, so, guess I'm all by myself again. But that's okay. I've decided, now, that I need some time alone. I think Jake does, too. But, noooooo. He's gotta go back to  her . And if she hurts Jake again, that's just too bad for him. I  know  it will happen. Prove me wrong, Kari. Prove me wrong!

      Okay. The last post, I have been informed, upset some people. I am truely sorry to all those that were offended. But, I will tell you this, though it may hurt, I tell it like it is. I have not lied. But, I did not intend to hurt anyone. I am sorry that I did.  *CTS*  Things are changing again. I woke up at 12:30 this afternoon, I got online, talked a little, got off, packed some clothes for my upcoming 8 day camping trip, and then I started eating "lunch" at like 3:00. As soon as I sat down to eat, Josh came over to give me some things that I'd left at his house. We talked, I showed him the pool, and then he tried to kiss me. (Sigh)... Poor guy didn't want to leave without a kiss. So then, when he left, Mr. Turner called me and told me that practice from 6:30 to 9 o'clock tonight was cancelled. So, I went back in the house and got ready to go out to dinner. We were going to go to the Hong Kong China Buffet in Flint, and then I talked my parents into going to Newport Coney Island in Owosso, where Jake works, but we ended going to Judes China Buffet in Owosso. I didn't talk to Jake all day until 11 o'clock tonight. And even then I only talked to him for less than 10 minutes. But he told me he'd be online. So I get online and send him a message, no response. Like 5 minutes later, Kari signs off and sends me a message: "i g2g", and he signed off. So now I'm sitting here wondering what the Hell I was thinking. I don't know what to say anymore. Shit.

      Yeah. Okay. This is my first post, so it's gonna be a long one. Gah! I don't know where to start. The beginning I guess... Okay, so last spring, Jake Turner liked me and asked me out. So I went out with him for 3 days and then broke up with him, thinking we'd be better as friends. Well, I broke his heart. He hated me for about a year. He got another girlfriend, Kari, and I got another boyfriend, Josh. So just recently I started talking to Jake again. At first, he rejected me, saying that he hated me and he wanted me to stay away. What I didn't know, is that in pushing people away, he is really testing them to see if they will come back, because he wants them to. So he had  liked  me the entire time. Even though he  LOVED  Kari. *** I had been with Josh for about 11+ months and actually already had a plan to break up with him, because he had no job, no car, his parents did everything for him, and he didn't respect me or my feelings. I needed someone new. So then Jake informed me of his feelings for me. I was thrilled! Except for one thing...he was still with Kari. The thing is, Jake and Kari had their past history of multiple break-ups, and in a relationship like that, it usually continues to happen. Unfortunately for Jacob, Kari was the one who kept breaking up with him. Well, as soon as I came into the picture, something horrible happened to Jake, Kari not only broke up with him again, but she broke up with him for another guy, Brenden. Jake was so upset. He came to me for help. I offered to be his friend, but he told me he needed more than that. So I told him of my plans to break up with Josh. He took it the wrong way at first, thinking that I was breaking up with Josh for him. But I reassured him that I had already had these plans. Another thing, though, is that I wasn't planning on breaking up with Josh for another week, and I wanted to wait at least 2 weeks before going out with anyone else, just out of respect for Josh. But Jake didn't want to wait. He wanted someone NOW. So the next day, he went back to Kari. Grr...I was so mad. I knew she'd hurt him again, I could feel it. Well, the next 2 days come around and BAM!...she breaks up with Jake and goes back to Brenden. Well, this time Jake didn't have to wait long, because I broke up with Josh that night. Earlier than I had planned. So Jake asked me out the next day, which was a Thursday, and I told him 'yes'. So Friday, we talked online and on the phone all day. And Friday night, after he got out of work, he came to my house after my dad left for work. He got here at about 9:50 and left at 10:30. It was one of the best nights I'd had. We made plans for Saturday night to play lazer-tag. Well, when he got home, he got online and told me he needed more time, because he still loved Kari, but he wanted to stay friends. So Saturday, we still went and played lazer-tag. It was THE BEST night of my life. So when we were done playing, we hopped in the car (shh...) and went to the KFC, A&W. Then we went back to the lazer place where my mom picked me up and I went home. Well, Sunday rolls around and Jake goes to see the movie SHREK 2 with Kari. Then he gets home and tells me that he had the most wonderful time with her and that she's gonna break up with Brenden soon to go back out with Jake. And Jake told me I'd never have another chance. OMG! I freaked out. I was going to kill myself. I couldn't take it. I was crying so hard. I called Josh, but he didn't care, so I called Dean-o. I talked to him for almost 2 hours and he totally calmed me down (thanks, man). So then I'm over it. Monday, I get up in the morning, get online, and talk to Jacob. I play around with him like a friend would, I was trying to be so nice, and he freaked out on me. He told me if I was going to be a stupid dyke, then he was leaving, so he signed off. Later, he called me, and he said, "Kristelle, I want you to stay away from me". No pain there, so I hung up on him. And I was just peachy, a little upset, but I was alive. Well, that same night, Jake calls me up, crying. He said that he had gone up to the park where Kari was working the concession stand to say 'hi'. But when he got there, Kari was working with Brenden. Kari got upset and yelled at him saying that he put her in a very hard position. So she said she'd never go back to him. Jake was going to kill himself. It was horrible listening to him like that. I felt so bad. So he asked if he could come over again. I said that he could after my dad left for work, so he did. He came over, jumped at my basketball net and broke it, lol, and then the mosquitos were biting so much that we got in his car to talk. So when we were in the car, he told me that he was genuinely sorry for what he did to me and he asked me back out, and I said...'yes'. Well, that was yesterday, last night. Today, we met Jennifer Granholm, the Governor of Michigan, at the Train Depot in Durand. And all Jake could do was talk to Kari. Uhm...I understand what he's feeling and that he's not totally over her, I'm not expecting him to bounce right back, he was engaged to her, no less. But it does hurt me. He told me not to worry, that he won't do what he did before. I trust him. But I'm not so sure I trust her. She was threatening me today. Saying that she'll fight to get him back. But honestly, if she loves him so much, why wouldn't she just keep him when she had him? She keeps hurting him so much. I know I'm the rebound girl, but I don't hurt Jake. He goes back to her knowing that she'll do it again. It's not my fault she screws things up. I don't want it to happen again. I won't go back next time.  Someone help.

      A sign proclaiming Interstate 75 showed in the white glare of her headlights. The road curved, and a dark expanse, darker than the road, darker than the trees, came into view, an endless black hole seemingly stretching forever.  She was driving too fast.  But she had to get there.  Now.  If not, she'd never do it.  A feeling of panic and dread rose within her.  Can I really do this? Can  YOU  really do this, Kristy?  Of course.  There is no other way.  She wiped her forehead with the sleeve of her black hooded sweatshirt. She realized that she was bathed in sweat. Hot and sticky, Kristelle rolled down her window and placed her arm outside the car.  What is  wrong  with you?  You can  do  this.  It'll be easy.  STOP SIGN.  DAMNIT! Why is there a fucking stop sign way the Hell out  here ?  She blew through it.  I DON'T FUCKING CARE!  Kristelle clicked on the radio, turning up the volume so she couldn't hear herself think.  As she drove, she tried to clear her mind, letting the music roll over her thoughts, letting the music push out everything she didn't want to think about, concentrating on it, flowing with it as if the music were driving the car, carrying her forward, carrying her away, away from home, away from people, away from her life.  Life. Life.  The word played over and over in her mind, repeating itself until it seemed to have no meaning.  Every once in a while, she would raise her eyes to the rear-view mirror and wonder if she should just turn around and go home.  Then she would quickly return her gaze to the highway and let the music carry her away.  I can't go back. I've come too far.  I'm too close.  SO close!  LOOK!  She could see the flashing-orange lights of the Toll Booths looming ahead.  The Mackinac Bridge.  I'm there!  There's no line, it's empty. No one here?  Cars pass through on the left, correct? Yes, I'm sure of it.  As Kristelle approached the booth, she slowed to a stop, and then she gunned it, crashing through the metal barrier lever.  I'M NOT GOING TO FUCKING PAY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR THIS!  She could feel the thoughts in her mind whirl around as if they were poisonous gases floating in an empty, open space.  Her head was reeling.  The bridge.  I'm here.  I'm here. I'm here.  What now?  Lake Huron on one side, Lake Michigan on the other.  Ohh, it's so beautiful.  Her mind was racing with thoughts. So many thoughts. Dangerous thoughts. A pretty girl her age should not be thinking what Kristelle was thinking. She shouldn't be there.  I shouldn't be here, she knew.  I shouldn't be, but I am.  And this is the last place I'll ever be, the last place I'll ever go, the last place I'll ever see.  Still driving too fast, induced by anger, Kristelle slowed at the first huge concrete pillar of the bridge and stopped shortly after. She exited her car, walking toward the East side of the empty bridge and looked out over Lake Huron, crossing her arms and thinking.  This is amazing.  I'm going to die here, and the view has already taken my breath away.  At the edge of the bridge the dark water sparkled under the full moon.  Amazing.  Kristelle looked directly beneath her. Water, but shallow, and rocky, she knew.  The perfect place.  She reached out for a cable attatched to the bridge and hoisted herself onto the enormous railing.  Memories suddenly flashed through her tattered mind. Memories that had brought her here. Memories that she didn't want to have anymore. Sad memories, tragic memories, all harsh, all so painful.  Kristelle could feel her anger start to build.  It always started in her chest, a heavy burning feeling. She could feel her chest tighten. Then the anger spread to her neck muscles. Then she felt the familiar throbbing at her temples.  I WANT TO DIE!  With a pained sigh, she turned and glanced in the opposite direction, toward Lake Michigan. The view just as breathtaking.  She giggled for some reason. A high pitched giggle.  The anger was still there, but she was beginning to calm down. The throbbing in her temples stopped. Her neck muscles relaxed.  She looked down again and gasped. I'm scared, there's no way I can do this. I have to get away from here. She moved, edging on the railing, still grasping the metal cable.  Careful.  But as she turned around - maybe she was nervous, maybe scared, or maybe she was deranged - she stopped, a strange grin on her face, and leapt backward off the bridge.  As she cascaded into the air and plummeted towards the roaring mercy of the Great Lake, her last utterance was carried with the winds, "Swallow me whole my love! The sweet kiss of death is my last request."

      So I haven't written in like 10 days. You're all having withdrawals, I know. Haha.      Okay, I don't know who posted the comment on my last entry, but I'm not going to yell at you for caring about Nick, although I'm sure you don't know the whole story. Yes, I read that story in his LJ also. Listen, I care for Nick very very much. He is my best friend. Anyone who knows him or knows me, knows THAT. The thing is, he has had the tendancy to like me as more than a friend, and this is the reason he gets so downhearted. Because I do not care for him in this way. Please don't tell me that this is my fault. You can't force someone to love someone else. I do love him...as a FRIEND. So stop with the "Thanks for hurting someone who loves you so much" crap. I don't do it on purpose. And now that you have to "take care of him more than usual"...(You make it sound like a chore. Don't you love him, too?)...I'm sure we won't have to worry about him being so depressed anymore, because he has you 4, whoever you are.  *CTS*  I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN LATELY. MY LIFE ROCKS! Last week, my cousin Clarissa came over and spent 2 nights. We swam and jumped on the trampoline, and listened to music, and painted our toe-nails (haha), and many other things. Plus! Wednesday, we went to a movie, Spiderman 2, with Hooch and Jents. It was great fun. But Clarissa keeps telling me how she regrets not making-out with Hoochie. Haha. I love you dear. Jents is really RAD! And he smells so good! Axe Body-Spray is the best! OH BOY, yeah! MJ! Haha, her name is Mary Jane! Hehehe, don't ask. Where's YOUR fancy stuff? Woo! Good stuff! Well, I gots-ta go. See ya!

      Get a load of me, get a load of you. Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you. It's just like we were meant to be.  Holding hands with you when we're out at night Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right. And I've got someone waiting too.  What if this is just the beginning. We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?  Isn't this the best part of breakin' up? Finding someone else you can't get enough of... Someone who wants to be with you too.  It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch. Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch. But wouldn't it be beautiful?  Here we go, we're at the beginning. We haven't fucked yet, but my heads spinning.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?  High enough for you to make me wonder Where it's goin'... High enough for you to pull me under. Somethin's growin' out of this that we can control. Baby I am dyin'.  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you? Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you? It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it. So tell me... Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?   Why Can't I - Liz Phair     Okay, that's how I felt. Now I'm over it.

This thing that I write in is for me to get my feelings out and for my FRIENDS to comment on. If you want to talk to me, talk to me, my AIM screenname is Kristelle2005. Then you can leave a comment. Maybe something nice. Thank you.
