						    Welcome to my diary.    It's friday and I am 4 hours away from a 2 week vacation.  I am going to Ottawa tonight for the weekend.  I love Ottawa because the men are totally hot and the women aren't.  When I travel there I feel like  a supermodel, which is easy getting used to but really hard to come down from.  Montreal is seething with women that are prettier than me, I come home and feel like a dirty old man.   Last time I was in Ottawa I partied at this club called Helsinki.  These guys with delusions of grandeur: 15 dollar cover; requisite rolling of the eyes.  But it turned out that there was this dj Max Graham there and the reason it was so bloody expensive to get in was because he is like local royalty on the club scene, people watch him spin and they swoon.  All over the club were people glowing with love for this guy.  Okay,  the music was good but come on people get a grip. He's not making you come from your ears or anything, god he wasn't even wearing a cool shirt.     Intrinsic difference between dancing in Montreal and dancing in Ottawa:  In Montreal, you dance, you get a vibe, you shake everything you have, and then men will dance with you.  It's an appreciation thing.  The better you dance, the better the odds that some dude will want to dance with you.  And if you're hot, forget about it, these guys are lining up.   But in Ottawa, you dance, you shake everything your mama gave you, and the guys are appreciating with their eyes, but that's it.  And when you try to make eye contact with them, they avert.  Almost in a panic.    Anyway good times had by all except for one other thing:  4 dollar Evian.  When you can drink a beer for less than you can drink water, there's a serious problem.

						    The weekend came like a young lover from the suburbs, too quick and without finesse.       ***      LOL      ***      Seriously though. I had been invited by a friend of mine to attend this corporate rape of a dinner at Moishes and had eagerly accepted but with some hesitatation.   Moishes--for those of you who don't live in Montreal or have never been here--is a pretty famous steakhouse where a filet mignon with nothing else on your plate costs 50 big ones and a side order of brocoli costs 10. I had never been there, but then again, I have never really been anywhere. So I said to Michelle "Sure I'll go, hey what can I say, free Moishes."      ***      So after shopping like a madman for something to wear to what I thought would be a pretty la dee da kind of dinner, and subsequently finding nothing, I went home, threw a curve hugging "me-ow!" kind of dress on, some strappy heels and jumped in a cab with my equally fabulous friend.    We sauntered in the place (well...you can't really saunter with strappy needle-thin heels on, but you get the point) and did the whole classic stand at the entrance with your best "I'm  wayyyyyyy  too cool for this " pout-face on and scanned the bar for a friendly face.       ***      "Dan! Hi!" Michelle said, her face brightening up into a controlled smile. She walked over to this leathery slick-haired old man with her hand out like they were meeting to discuss shares or something and that this was her office. I walked obediently behind her, not knowing what role I should play for this game. I waited to be introduced. Finally, after they had said their hellos, Michelle stepped aside and said "This is my good friend Eve." Dan, whoever he was, took my hand, looked me in the eye and with a coy little smile asked me if I was Michelle's lesbian lover.      Blink.      "She wishes." I responded.       ***       2 things :       One, WHAT THE FUCK PEOPLE? First someone thinks I'm in drag, now I am a lesbian lover? Why??? WHY???????      Second, I should have known. I mean if the first thing a man says to me is hi, I think you're a lesbian, you have a pretty good idea how the rest of the night is going to go.   ***   Okay so back to "yeah she wishes." Michelle looks a little shocked, I mean this is a la dee da kind of affair, I guess I'm supposed to be demure or something? But she laughs because what else can you expect from me, seriously now. You can dress me up and take me wherever but hope I don't talk, that's all I'm saying. Dan kind of raises an eyebrow and is surprised for a moment. He smiles, says, "well I thought you might be lovers." To which I respond, in my element now, "I'm too well dressed to be a dyke."  Of course I am referring to my dress and it is a joke. I am trying to be funny, change the subject, get away. He looks at my dress and says, "Yes you look ravishing."  "Thanks," I say, unsure as to whether he is making fun of me or not. I decide that he isn't, he's just being a dirty old man.     The introductions are being done slowly. Each of these men has his own special way of leering. I prepare myself for quite a night. Finally Michelle and I get the chance to order some wine, we take sips from our glasses and are quiet alone for a moment.  "Am I doing okay?" I ask from the corner of my mouth.  "Yes."'  "Do I look okay?"  "Yes."  "Do I really look like a lesbian?"  "Yes."  I love Michelle.  ***  Okay so we start filtering into the dining room where a long, thin table has been set up for us. We are a group of about 14 or 16, who knows. One of the dirty old men holds my waist and tells me that the seating arrangements will have to be girl / guy / girl / guy. Which is hilarious because Michelle and I are the only two women there. But anyway this particular dirty old man, we'll call him Yellow Shirt, sits between us. But a gentleman at first, holding out our chairs and seating us (which was nice. Not enough guys do that.)  I am clinging to my wine. All around me are men in pastel shirts, except for one. He is sitting directly in front me me, has bushy eyebrows, thick hairy arms and is obviously the man in charge here. He has a black shirt. He is the president of the affiliate company. He looks like a pouter. I know to be nice.   A pouter, by the way, is a man who absolutely needs to get his own way / get the last word / be the funniest or he will punch hole in a wall.  It would be cute if it weren't so scary. Pouters are the worst losers. If a Pouter gets the wrong order in a restaurant, he's the one that won't say anything but who will kind of sigh and move food around on his plate rather than eat. He wants everyone to know how much his food sucks. If you turn down a Pouter's advances in front of his friends, he will call you a lesbian, and then go out and buy a corvette.  Anyway Pouters are scary.  ***      I'm not sure how it happened but somehow the conversation went from me explaining what I do for a living to me explaining why I don't wear underwear.       Facts about underwear:       1) They serve no purpose for me. I have nothing to pin down hold up or hold in. Underwear are useless.      2) Granny Bums (what I call panties) are bulky and can be seen through whatever it is that you are wearing. There is nothing classy about underwear lines. I don't care who you are.      3) Thongs are uncomfortable. An inch of lacy fabric in the crack of my ass for 12 hours a day? NO THANKS.      4) I have no one to impress. If I had a man who liked underwear and liked to see me in them, I would wear them. I own a few pairs. I even own a garter belt, another one of those devices with no purpose. But as it stands, with my life the way it is now, it is much simpler just to go commando.       FAQs       No, I do not wear underwear even when wearing a short skirt.   No, my skirt has never flown up and exposed my bare ass.     No, I would not be embarassed if it did.   No, I do not wear underwear when I work out.   Yes, I get weird looks in the changing room.      ***      From there things went from bad to worse.      Don't forget, we've all been drinking wine, and the dinner was about 2 hours long. After two hours of drinking good french wine and eating good fifty dollar steaks, things are bound get to a little casual.   These guys are asking me questions that I have no idea how to answer. Like if I like to receive oral sex. What kind of qiestion is that??? I am the same age as some of their daughters I'm sure, a fact I wanted to point out. But I held my tongue. Not my place, just grin and bear it.      Thankfully I got a little peice of redemption by the end of the night when The Pouter was paying the bill and the maitre'd came to tell him that he had a phone call. HA HA HA we all know what that means fucker: you should pay your Visa bill on time.      Obviously my cue to leave.       ***      Michelle and I shared a cab with her colleague Lou and Yellow Shirt and ended up at this godawful bar called Winnie's on Crescent Street. We were waiting for the rest of the dirty old men to show up. Winnie's was playing poser rock from the early nineties, which was giving Yellow Shirt a hard on. He wanted to dance. He kept asking me to go up to the floor with him, by the 4th time turning him down I felt sort of bad and allowed myself to be pulled up to the makeshift dancefloor.      I looked way too fabulous to be dancing with some old man at Winnies of all fucking places.      Then Michelle's boss showed up, this old puritan by day and sado-masochist by night type guy who smells like old money and looks British. At one point Lou fucked off, leaving Michelle and I with Boss and Yellow Shirt, dancing to early nineties cheeze rock.       "Michelle, you know everyone here thinks we're escorts." I said when we sat back down. We looked around and knew I was right, I mean think about it, two hot 24 year old girls dressed to the gills with these two fucking geisers wearing pastel shirts and shaking their little asses to Springteen....my god what happened to us?      It was clearly time to go.       We took the metro home, hugged at my front door and as I walked up the stairs into my normal life with my kitten and my book and my tv, I thought: thank god I have a life to go back to.

						   I finally figured out how to get a pic in my profile, so check it out.  Now you will know what I look like!  ***  The pic was taken 2 years ago by this photographer named Norm Edwards who was working on a book called  200 Women, 200 Sheets .  In exchange for a shoot, he gave the 200 women portfolios of sorts. I was one of them.  ***  If you go to his site ( urlLink www.normedwards.com ) you will see me and the other ladies he shot for this project.  Good times.  I felt like a model for a day.

						    To make things interesting today I have a contest going for my staff:      Whoever guesses how many cavities I have will get a prize.      The prize will be mouthwash, dental gum and a floss thingie.      How cheesy is that?

						    Well I have one traumatic and one totally awesome thing to tell you guys about today:  First of all I have 12 cavities. (Oh yeah, that's the traumatic part.) The dentist looked me in the eye with this totally sad face and said "How did you ever let this happen to yourself?" It wasn't a question.    I nearly burst into tears. It was a really ligitimate but really mean thing to say. He doesn't know how poor I was and how my mother didn't care, how she never brought us to a dentist when we were kids. He doesn't know that I could only afford to see a dentist like 3 years ago but by then there was so much wrong with my mouth that I was scared to face it. He doesn't know that I have to take a fucking sedative to even enter his office. I should have splashed that plastic cup full of mouthwash in his face and marched out. But instead I felt tears well up in my eyes and in a moment of shame and weakness (because really that's how I feel about this) I hung my head and said, barely audible, "I know."  So I have 12 cavities and I have to get one of my teeth pulled because it's just crowding all of my other teeth. Having teeth pulled is the worst because even with your discman on and listening to the most raucus classical music, you can still hear it. From the inside.  ***  Yeah I listen to classical when I go to the dentist because I can close my eyes and it's soothing somehow. Also I don't know if you've noticed but classical cds are over an hour long and they never get boring because there are no choruses.  I usually listen to Mozart for anything involving a drill because there are no pauses (hardly) in most of his work so it's crazy genius music the whole time and no silences.  ***      Okay so now for the happy totally kick ass thing.      On my way to the dentist's I stopped in the pet store on De L'Eglise and met the kitty of my dreams:        She had these big big hazel eyes and was black and grey tabby, god she was cute.      So I went up to her cage like a crazy old lady and said "Hi munchkin!" in that sappy high pitched voice that people use when they are talking to babies, puppies and kittens.  "Look how cute you are, little munchkin, you're only small!"      I asked the lady at the counter how much she was and when I saw that I could afford her I said "SOLD!" and paid for her right away.        "I wonder what I am going to call you?"  I said into the cage as my transdaction as being drawn up.      "Munchkin sounds pretty good to me"  the lady at the counter said and I agreed.  So I paid for her and told the lady I'd be back after my dentist appointment and on my way to the dentist's I was smiling like a crazy lady and thinking if Munchkin is really what I want to call my cat for the next 20 years.  But it was too late.  She will be Munchkin forever now.      So her full name is Munchkin Sugarpuss because she is so sweet.      I picked her up after the dentist's and she filled my heart with so much joy that drills and dental fees and stupid hairy dentists that make me feel like crying were forgotten.      ***      Munchkin has these really long back legs so she walks kind of like a raptor.  It's really cute.  She slept with me last night, which was nice, but she crapped in my bed, which isn't.      Oh well.  Kitten crap, it's like the size of a spoonful of pudding and smells like bird seed.

						    Shitty, I have a dentists' appointment after work today. I'd rather spend the 175 bucks on clothes or shoes or kittens or whatever but noooooooooo, apparently teeth need to be taken care of too. Stupid teeth.  ***  I hate the dentist. First of all, I am scared shitless of them. The sound of a drill just freaks me out. For a long time I avoided them like the plague, going only every few years to get the requisite cleaning or when things were hurting because we all know that when it hurts to eat chocolate, something has to give.  ***  The last time I went was last year, and that was because a filling fell out. I didn't have insurance so it cost me like 1.5 million dollars.  I should have gone back after that, but knowing all of the other work I needed done I decided to put it off until I got a job with insurance.  Now that I have a job with insurance, it's time to milk that fucker dry.  ***  My insurance is so weird.  I am covered for the silliest services.  For instance, if I want to see a herbologist, I can.      So I will.      ***      Insurance companies and the people who work for them are big time evil, almost more than pharmaceuticals even.  You can tell that these two industries are like cousins and hang out together and drink beer and talk about how they scored over the weekend.        Anyway.  Wish me luck.  I have $2000 to spend on my smile so when I go to Italy in May, I will knock those Italians out with my pearly whites.  That way when I am sipping champagne in a gondola in Venice with a short skirt and strappy heels on, my smug smile of knowing how fabulous I am will be white and beautiful. Yay!

						    They call Wednesday  Hump Day,  but I can tell you ladies and gentlemen that it has been my experience that maybe 36 out of 52 times a year, this is false.  ***  Wednesday is the second worst day of the week. Contrary to popular beleif, Tuesday is the worst, beating Monday by a long shot. Here is why:   Monday , you are fresh from the weekend and although you didn't sleep as much as you would any other day, you just slept in for like 2 days straight so it isn't that big of a deal. You know in the back of your mind that you will be sitting in an office for the next 40 hours of your life, and you are okay with that, because you are relaxed...you most certainly got drunk over the weekend, you might have gotten laid but you at least probably masterbated like 4 times, you're feeling pretty good.   Tuesday  is the worst because you are more tired, and you still have 32 hours of work left in your week. Minimum. But now you are less relaxed and the thought of spending the majority of your life in an office isn't as tolerable as it was the day before. It's like the rest of your week is waving at you from a beach and going na na na na na na it's only Tuesday. Sucker.  Then  Wednesday  is a little bit better but not much because you can't say until like 1:00 in the afternoon that the week is half over. And then there's the whole issue of calling it hump day which, as I said, is sadly often not the case.   Thursday  kicks ass as the 2nd best day of the week. For a lot of us, Thursday is Pay Day so that's cool. Also it is a pretty good day to party, you're not too tired yet from the week, and there is only one day to go until the weekend.   Friday  is overrated. It's cool because if your office is nice and is likely to give you short days at work, chances are these days will fall on a Friday. But Fridays are always stressful at the office because of deadlines and preparing for the weekend, and then you're too tired to party Friday night. Unless you take a nap. But Friday evening naps are the worst, they make you feel worse than had you not slept at all. Unless you are one of those people who can take 4 hour power naps and climb mountains or something.  Of course you can always take drugs. But don't. It's bad for you.     Anyway Fridays are the 3rd best day in the week.   Saturday  is the best day of the week because from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed, everything you do is completely up to you. There are no deadlines, no reasons to be awake, no reasons to do anything. You can sit on your couch naked for 3 hours eating ice cream and picking lint out of your belly button if you want to. And then that night, you get dressed up, throw some heels on and party like your life depends on it and it's like you're alive, really alive, for the first time in 7 days.  Okay maybe I am exaggerating a bit but you have to admit, Saturday is pretty kick ass from start to finish.   Sunday  is the middle day, because you can wake up at whatever time you want and there are no deadlines. But it sucks a little too because Sunday is usually laundry/cleaning/grocery shopping etc day. Also Sunday is the day of hangovers, physical and emotional. If you didn't do anything that weekend this is the day to feel like a big fat loser and question your existence. Then again, if you did  too much  and woke up in some strange man's bedroom with mascara all over your face and wondering what his name was, this is the day to feel bad about that too.    ***  So to recap, the days of the week, in order from best to worst are:  1-Saturday  2-Thursday  3-Friday  4-Sunday  5-Monday  6-Wednesday  7-Tuesday

						    As some of you know I have had some pretty bad luck in the pet department.  When I moved in, I had two cats.  4 months later I have zero (one ran away and the other was graciously taken by my mother.)  When I moved in there was no pigeon problem, now there are 8 on my balcony doing nothing but shitting and fucking and laying more eggs.        In other words I went from 2 cats and 0 pigeons to 8 pigeons and 0 cats in just inder two months, how do these things happen and why?  WHY???????      Anyway.  I waited a while to see if Simon would come back (that was 2 months ago) and he hasn't.  I loved him so much, he was my meow.  We were a team.  It was me and Simon against the world!  For a while I didn't think I could move on and get another cat.  But now I see that living a meow-less existence sucks ass and I am on the market to adopt 1 or preferably 2 kittens.      I would adopt a full grown cat except that I don't want to.  I  want kittens in the house!        So drop a line at   urlLink  grrrl24@hotmail.com    if you have or know anyone who has kittens to give away or sell.  In exchange I will buy you 1, maybe 2 beers and maybe a chocolate bar if you're lucky and I'm feeling generous.

						    Someone from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Montreal called yesterday to screen me a bit.  She informed me that a commitment to BB/BS often translates into mutliple years, at 3-4 hours a week.  She also informed me that I might have to wait a while to get a partner because there is a much greater need for Big Brothers than there is for Big Sisters.  The reason for this is that in order to be qualified to get a big brother or sister, you have to come from a single parent family.  Usually there are more kids without fathers than there are without mothers.        Anyway I told her I was still interested and the next step is an orientation meeting at their offices early in September.        Yay!

						    I went to a house party this weekend in the Old Port. It was the first house party I had been to in a really really long time. House parties just aren't worth throwing anymore I guess, which is too bad, because I always enjoy them.      Anyway this particular house party had an eighties theme, which was about 2 minutes away from getting old but thankfully the hosts got the idea in time.      ***      Michelle, Sonia and I decided to go to Village Des Valeurs to get some cheap-o radical stuff to wear because we take theme parties and halloween very seriously. Also we didn't want to spend too much money on stuff we weren't likely to ever wear again. Eighties is really in style now and honestly it's not something I'm thrilled about. My eyes are always gagging, it hurts.  Because people, honestly: if acid washed jeans weren't cool the first time around, I doubt that making them 200 dollars more expensive will help them to be cooler.       Also I am pretty poor these days. The reason for this is when I have money I have no sense of self control. I spend spend spend, logic being if I die tomorrow I would rather have stuff than money in the bank.      ***     Okay so we went to Le Chateau first because as I mentioned before, 80's is really in now and personally speaking I would rather spend 20 bucks on something half decent that can be worn again maybe twice than spend 5 bucks on something so ugly I have to burn it when I'm done. But there was nothing there worth buying. The only thing they had were those godawful dust ruffle skirts that I hate more than anything else in fashion right now, and those striped tops that look like they should be worn with berets and 100 mm cigarettes.    Sonia and I used to work at Village des Valeurs back in our punk rock days so we know how to shop there. It was the coolest job. We were essentially paid to shop becuase every article of clothing we saw and liked, we put in the back and bought at lunch. Also it was a cool job because when we were tired or hungover or both, we would sleep in the clothing bins in the back where they sort the clothes.       Sonia and I started in the dress aisle and within minutes were on the floor holding our bellies, laughing so hard I swear to god I thought I was going to pee. These dresses were from the 80's alright... gold lamée, ruffles, bows, sequins, tassles...they were like little metallic crimes against humanity. My eyes were vomitting left and right. But I knew that we had stumbled upon a goldmine, because Michelle heard us laughing from another section in the store and came to see what the fuss was about. You know you have something good when your friends hear you laughing in a store the size of a football field.      We had found a dress that was perfect for her, and begged her to try it on. She knew looking at it that it was perfect and that it was going to fit her too. We will do anything for comedy. So she tried it on and the fucking thing fit her like a glove. If it were 1987 and she was going to her prom, this might be what she would have bought, it fit her that well. Shit she almost made it look good. So now that she was in, Sonia and I had to find dresses that were equally atrocious, which wasn't hard. Within 20 minutes all three of us were standing around the changing rooms laughing hysterically and admiring how bad we looked.       "Are we really going to do this?" Sonia asked. You could tell that each of us privately hoped the other would back out. There was no way in hell any of us would dress this way alone.       "I'll do it if you do it." was the standard response. Of course we did it. Like I said, anything for the sake of comedy. Sonia picked up something for her boyfriend Dean, and we were laughing our way back to the car.      ***      5 hours later we were at Sonia's house and all dressed up and ready to go. When I figure out how to get pics up here I will show you, but for now you will have to rely on my description of what we looked like:       Sonia       Clearly looked the best by today's stanbdards. Actually she looked almost like Madonna in the Like A Virgin video. Her dress was shell pink and had two layers. First was the silky layer and on top was this layer of lace. It buttoned up to her neck and had long sleeves with puffy shoulders, it was hideous. She bought a satin pink clutch purse to go with it, and tied her hair in a side ponytail that she teased the shit out of. Unfortunately she didn't get any shoes so she wore her red Globes, which sort of gave her away.        Michelle       Michelle looked the most authentic. Her dress had long sleeves, with a black velour bodice, and magenta satin ruffle skirt complete with large bow in the front and white beaded tassles strategically placed at the seams. Her shoulders were 5 inches high with puffiness. She teased the shit of her hair and got this enormous cowlick too, it was at least 4 inches high. She got this godawful purple purse to go with it. Again, she didn't bother buying any shoes for the occassion so was wearing these brown bowling style shoes, which gave her away.       Me         I looked the worst. When we went to buy beer at the depanneur near Sonia's place, these people who were attending another party kind of laughed at us for a bit. One of them thought I was in drag at first.    Yep,   when a guy thinks you're in drag, you know you are not sexy .      My dress was the most hideous of them all, a metallic blue, shin length long sleeved nightmare. It had a two inch wedge of foam in each shoulder, which created the illusion that I could play for the Montreal Allouettes. The dress had two really bad qualities. One, the triangle of missing material in the back so that my back was exposed, and not in a good way, and two, the fact that it was a-line from tits to hips so it kind of made me look like a door wearing a skirt.     Seriously, everything that I hate about my body was highlighted by wearing this dress, and everything I like about my body was either hidden or overshadowed.    ***       Given that I am single, this story has 2 points:  1) that I am very very brave, and 2) I was not getting laid that night.      ***    Along with my dress I wore these really tacky, fake gold, sea shell shaped earrings, and carried this black and fake-gold clutch purse. Again, no shoes, so had to wear my red Roxys.  My hair was in a high, side ponytail with really big bangs and I even gave myself a fake mole a la Madonna. In other words, I am a complete loser with no sense of dignity.    ***    I really should have predicted this, it's so fitting, but no one else at the party dressed up except for this one guy who wore a dangly earing and aviator glasses a la George Michael, and this chick who wore a banana yellow outfit complete with patent leather yellow pumps. So Michelle, Sonia and I stuck out like three really big shouldered freaks. But we did manage to make it look cool, and that's what really matters. In fact, those people we met at the dep near Sonia's house ended up coming to the party because they thought, hey, if these chicks are dressed like  that ,  it has to be cool.      And it was.

						   I had a weird dream the other night about someone I haven't seen in a few months and who I miss all the time named JD. He and I had a funny little relationship that revolved around sex mostly. I fell quickly and thoroughly in love with him but sadly, his heart stayed firmly on its feet. We subsequently tried to pursue a friendship that was doomed to fail before it ever really started. It has been my experience that when one person feels romantically inclined about the other, no matter how good his or her intentions, the frienship will not work out.  Anyway ours failed despite my better efforts and I am still partially in love with him and miss him all the time because underneath it all, we were really good for one another.  ***  There were a few things about him that were so easy to love. For instance instead of saying no, he'd make a "tsk" sound with his lips. It was so very very yummy when he did that; I often asked him questions whose answers I knew were no, just to hear it.  He was very calm and assured. He had an answer for everything. He was patient and understanding. He was temperate. He was nice.  My fantasies about him often revolved around simple things like us cooking together. I had this one recurring fantasy where he would be at the stove making something and I would be tossing a salad at the table and we would be talking in the quiet tones of people who have had conversations like these a thousand times before and would continue to do so for a long, long time.  ***  When things ended I was very sad, and cried for a week.  ***  The thing is, I don't cry. Only at movies, and even then it's not a big deal. Usually whoever I'm with doesn't even notice. But when things ended with JD I was crying all the time. I kind of appreciated it about myself. It's so human.  *** Anyway I haven't heard from JD since and have not tried to make contact because as great as he was, JD was also a big fat jerk. Our friendship ended becuase he was taking advantage of the situation, which is intolerable. When I give you my heart, you had better treat it with care fucker or I will take it right back and I promise you won't have another chance. So I walked away. Actually here is the letter I wrote him:   "Dear JD, You made it clear some time ago that you did not want to pursue a romantic relationship with me, and this I accepted. However recently you made it equally clear that you do not want to pursue a friendship with me, and so I will smile the Mona Lisa smile of someone who has been thoroughly fucked and walk away before the shit house goes up in flames.  Best of luck to you,  Eve"   ***  To which he responded:   "Dear Eve, I think you may have jumped to conclusions prematurely but if this is how you feel, I must respect that and your wishes. JD."   ***  Oh man. You could  hear  my heart breaking.  ***  For the longest time afterwards I waited for him to call. I would scan the cars outside my work for his, hoping he'd have come to his senses, hoping that he loved me too, underneath it all.  But it has been almost 3 months and that moment never came.  ***  I was almost over it. But then, just to make things interesting, my subconcious decided to throw in a hummer of a dream and now I am thinking about him all over again.  In the dream he came by my place but I missed him. He had left a note. The note said that he missed me and that he loved me and that he was sorry. Just as I was reading it I started to wake up. And as I was waking up and realized that it was a dream, I started to hate myself for getting my hopes up, even if it was during a state of unconciousness.  ***  The moral of this post is that I am a big softie.  ***  No. The moral of this post is that love is awesome even if it isn't always pleasant, and it is better to have loved and lost than not loved at all. I guess.

						   If you read my last two posts you might have picked up on the fact that I have decided to try to become a Big Sister here in Montreal. It was a decision I made sometime last week after mulling it over for a few months, and I am totally excited to see what happens with my application. The application process was really easy. No questions about whether or not I have murdered anyone. Yay!  Seriously though, I have wanted to volunteer for some time now. I find myself to be a an extemely selfish person, and it's the only way I can think of to try and balance that out. I think that Big Brothers / Big Sisters is a great organization, and guess what, they can use a lot of help, so if you have a few hours a week to spare why don't you try volunteering too? They are in much greater need for male volunteers, so guys let's make with the goodwill shall we?  The process is pretty simple. First you fill out an application, then you have an interview. I haven't been called in for one yet, but I imagine that's when they will ask all the good stuff like whether or not I have any mental problems (none that I know of), whether or not I have been convicted for anything(nope) and what my interests are so they can pair me up with a kid whose interests are similar to mine.  I hope I get a little punk rocker so I can tell her how much Avril sucks and try to get her into the Lunachicks or something.  Or maybe she will be on a hockey team and I can go check out her games because I love hockey but I really really hate the NHL now. I wanted to boycott two years ago when the fucking Anaheim Mighty Ducks made it to the playoffs and then last year was just like the icing on the cake for me. Tampa Bay Lightening?!? WTF people? Here are two teams belonging to states that have no snow and no ice, which means that they should not have hockey. But that's another rant altogether.  Jeez I guess I better stop with the swearing or they will never let me volunteer.  ***  It will be so cool. On the weekend I can take her out to lunch and then we can go get our nails done and then I can take her to museums and stuff. We will have a blast. I can buy her stuff for her birthday and do her hair and I can give her career advice and encourage her talents. Especially if she has a talent for writing,  like I did when I was young. OMG I could put her drawings up on my fridge and be cheezy/cool like they are in the commercials!  Wouldn't that be awesome?  I hope they think I am mature enough for this. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

						   I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Pete for misquoting him in an earlier post about Jack Kerouac's mom.  I am still unsure what he really said  verbatim , so I won't try to fix it. I'd just make it worse if I tried, beleive me.  All I want you all to know is that when Pete mentioned that had a man hit on his daughter, he was trying to imply that our conversation would have been a lot different.  I will leave it at that.  ***  These posts often reflect my reality.  Conversations that you read about in my blog really did take place and although I am not in the position to remember them word for word, I try to give you, the reader, the gist of what was said.  I have not bothered to change any names because honestly, who reads this?   But since I don't want to step on any more toes, I might just stop using names altogether.  This way everyone has a sense of anonymity.   ***  Again, sorry Pete for misquoting you and giving your words the opportunity to be taken out of context.  It won't happen again.

						   This is a quiz someone sent me. I fucking LOVE these things. You read them about people you know and you find out things you never imagined about them, even if you've known them for like 15 years.  Also it's fun like hell to talk about yourself so filling one of these babies out is like candy for your mind.  Here is mine. It's long like a fucker so you can scan just areas of interest if you like.    If you like it and want to fill one out yourself, let me know and I will e-mail it over to you.  ***    Vitals     Date of birth :: Late in December.

						    Have you seen that commercial for Skittles yet, the one where Grandma flashes the 15 year old kid in a fit of candy induced insanity?  Yeah well if you haven't let me break it down for you:  The scene: An elderly couple's living room. You can tell by the serious lack of vibrant color and the doillies everywhere. I think the main color is beige. And the couch? It's brown and just reeks of a visit to your grandmother, you could almost smell the mothballs. There is an old phonograph playing some crooner style music (think Honeymooners theme song) which is hilarious because our grandparents all still love their phonographs. Yeah.  In this archaic museum of sadness and tragedy we call their living room, we find Grandma and Grandpa. They're old. They have poochie little bellies and are wearing varying shades of grey and beige. Also they are both wearing cardigans, the uniform of the elderly right? In classic marketing attention to detail, one is sitting in a settee and the other in an arm chair because old people who have been married for more than 3 or 4 years intrinsically hate each other and do not want to sit too close. Which is why there is a collective AW! from society when we see old people holding hands and still loving each other but that's another rant altogether.  Visiting them is a dashing young 15 or 16 year old kid. You can tell he's dashing by the sporty ensemble in bright colors he is wearing on his perfectly sporty, wholesome looking body. I'm telling you, attention to detail folks.  He's sitting on a couch, facing Grandpa and Grandma. There is a tense-ness between them that indicates that they are not related (because of they were, it would be weird....actually, it would be knee deep in Kerouac's mother's territory.)    So someone (I'm guessing the kid) pours a bag of Skittles (and the colors pop like gumballs in a sea of grey ladies and gentleman, you gotta love marketing) into a fucking candy dish (because if old people love anything, it's candy dishes) and the next thing you see is one very old, very arthritic hand reach into the bowl and grab a bunch with an audible "hm" that says "hm, bright little dots of candy. Interesting. Maybe these will make me forget that I am an 85 year old marketing tool."  Next thing you know there's Grandpa scratching with the record on the phonograph (I'm no expert here but I doubt you could get a decent sound from scratching a record on a phonograph, anyway) and Grandma stands up to do a rap about how she's a badass. And the kids of North America are screaming with glee because look how cool! Grandma's rapping!  But then bad gets worse. At the end of her little rap, Grandma grabs her blouse and cardigan in each arthritic hand and rips that fucker wide open for the kid to see.  Okay, I'm guessing (praying?) that grandma is wearing a bra but still, dude's face when she unleashes her girls is one of shock, disgust and fear. He gets up like a 15 year old boyscout and puts one of those couch doillies on her, to cover her up, and sits her down back into the arm chair like an accident victim.  Meanwhile, in happy colors that make your retinas beg for mercy, Skittles is telling you to taste the rainbow.   Hey Skittles: Why don't you taste my ass you fucking arseholes?   (understatement:)I have a few problems with this ad. For one, I think that we as a society should have more respect for our elderly than that. In a world where there are literally six million ways to die, I respect the shit out of people who manage to make it 80 years without kicking the bucket. These geysers obviously have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel, giving Death the big Fuck You. The least we can do is not make them flash their grandkids during a visit. Seriously. And if I see one more grandma rapping I swear to god I will unleash a fury unparalleled. And believe me boys, I can do it.     ***  Another problem I have is that the woman's hands are fucking  gnarled  with arthritis. Her fingers are practically curved for crying out loud. It must have hurt her, physically hurt this poor woman's hands, to do this commercial. The next time you see this ad, look at her hands and think about all the takes she would have had to do to get the fucking scene right. I want to vomit with rage just thinking about it.  I hate it so much I would boycott Skittles if I thought they were good enough to be worth boycotting. As it stands I associate Skittles with carsickness and haven't had any in at least 10 years. Colorful bite sized shit pellets as far as I'm concerned.     ***  Some of my friends think the commercial is hilarious and claim to have almost peed when they saw it the first time. I guess that's what Skittles was going for. These friends, the Pro-Flashers, think I should grow a sense of humour about it.  People  really . If anyone on this planet has a sense of humour it's me. I just don't think that old ladies should be used as marketing tools. In fact, I resent that before this commercial made it to air, before the shoot even, a group of people in business suits sat around a big black table and actually had a conversation about how great it would be to have an old woman flashing some teenager for a commercial, and that the majority of them thought it was a good idea. That's what I resent the most. That these suit wearing, Toyota Corolla driving, palm pilot using, adultering, fishing on the weekends and playing golf in the morning fuckers had the nerve to discuss this commercial idea, have a good laugh, pat themselves on the fucking back and say Yep, this ones a keeper.

						   As you may or may not know I am reading a biography of Jack Kerouac whose title I cannot remember. The reason for this is that when I read books or listen to songs I am unconcerned with their names. I think people who make it a point to memorize the name of author and title of the book they are reading are doing so only to brag about it later on. "I'm reading such and such by so and so muah muah muah" with their big fat cigar and bowtie god I hate these people.  The only time I remember who the book is written by or what the book is called is if it is so good that I have to recommend it by everyone I know or meet. Otherwise the author remains a stranger and rightly so.  But Eve, they say, But Eve, that's like bringing a stranger to bed every night. I say fuck that. An author whose name I have no reason to remember is not a stranger, she's just a snack, something to tide me over until the author of my dreams comes around.  Anyway.  I am reading this biography of Jack Kerouac and I learned something really wild about him last night, that many of you probably already know but still... It blew my mind so maybe it will blow yours too: Jack's mom, a French Canadian woman he called Memere (how cute is that?) tried to seduce him when he was in his thirties.  His  mom .  What blows me away about that is that she tried to do it when he was a grown man. By the time you are 30 you know that you should not be fucking your mother. You will have attended at least one Introduction to Psychology class, and even the biggest recluse on the planet has heard about Freud and Oedipus so there is no excuse. But the biggest shit in the bowl ladies and gentlemen, what  really  freaks me out, is that Memere must have been around 50 by this point. After 50 years in our society, she knew that what she was doing was wrong, and yet she got the nerve to do it anyway.  The nerve! You could cut glass with nerve like that!  Imagine the risk. Imagine wanting to fuck your son so bad that you are brought to the point of propositioning him. Imagine facing the look of disgust on his face, and saying fuck it, I'll do it anyway because I'd rather regret something I did than something I didn't do.  Wow.  ***  I told Pete and Lisa about it over lunch today and Pete kind of chuckled. I asked him why and he said that we live in a funny world, that had the roles been reversed and a father propositioned his daughter, the mood of our conversation would be completely different. "You would be saying, what a fucking asshole to do such a thing rather than, I wonder what was wrong with her that she wanted to fuck her son."  I didn't respond then because he had a point and I didn't want to address it without thinking about it first. So I walked away from the restaurant thinking about sexual mores and how the same intention or idea coming from different sexes can have such radically different associations. And I thought:  Pete, the reason why we react differently is because we know that  if a man really wants to fuck a woman ,  he can . All he has to do is get a decent hard on and force her. Sadly, when we as a society think of a man's sexual need, we think of the violence that can be associated with it.  However, when a woman wants a man, be it her son or a stranger or whatever, there is no way she can force it on him. The only thing she can do is manipulate him emotionally or psychologically, and even that allows the man to make a choice.  In other words, the difference between a man's need and a woman's need for sex is that a woman relies on a consenting partner and a man does not.  So Pete, until men stop ramming their cocks into people who don't want their holes plugged, we will always equate male sexuality with violence, even if only on the subliminal level.

						   I skipped work today and went to the St. Sauveur water slides. My arms and shoulders are this angry crimson color now from spending more than 10 minutes in the sun. I had a pretty good time, except for the fact that in the seven hours I was there I only got to go on like 5 rides. The lines were atrocious. I wanted to ask these people if they had jobs but I could tell my the tans that they did not. You can tell the people who skipped work to be there by their serious lack of color.  ***  There is something really weird about waiting in line half naked and slightly damp.  ***  I got to speak to one of my ex boyfriends for a while. He and I dated in grade eleven and even lost our virginity to one another. He was really sweet. I dumped him after a year because of many reasons, the biggest one being that I wanted to do more than hang out in his room giving him blowjobs and watching bad sitcoms on his 13 inch tv. Anyway. We got to talk for the first time in years and it was nice. So much time has passed since those days of hanging out in his room, so many things changed, we're not even the same people anymore. I'm not nearly as sweet, I can tell you that much. I know I'm not a sweet person because when I meet girls that are really nice, I realize how not nice I am. Kind of like gauging a tan based on how pale the rest of your skin is.  I admire girls who can be really friendly and nice and sweet.  ***  Shane (that's his name) is a very nice guy and totally hot. I have had crushes on him since we broke up so many years ago, but have never done anything about it because I think I really hurt him when we broke up, even though we were both kids really. He is totally against one night stands, and wants to meet his soul mate.   Shane, best of luck to you my friend. I hope you have a soul mate, and furthermore, I hope you find her.     ***  It makes me wonder if soul mates exist and if we know them when we find them. I wonder who mine is. Is he fabulous like me?  Of course he is. He would have to be.

						   So people at work keep on asking how my vacation was. I can't tell them what I really did (D is for debauchery, kids) so I am forced to say, "Not much" and leave it at that. They always look so disappointed.  ***  I have the worst luck in the world too. Halfway through my vacation I got the flu or something, and it was raining all the time so I just sort of hung out and read poetry and watched a hell of a lot of TV.  Hard to be debaucherous when you're leaking from all ends and hanging out on the couch all day. Shit after a week of that   I found myself worrying about terrorist attacks (too much CNN I guess) and craving Kraft Dinner. I haven't had Kraft Dinner in years. Don't know, maybe I developed standards?  ***  I hate CNN. I think Wolf Blitzer is the human equivalent of a textbook that's been hanging out in puddles all day. And what kind of name is Wolf Blitzer anyway? It's like he tried to get into porn and then couldn't make with the wood come audition time and thought to himself, well, there's always the news...  ***  What I hate most about CNN is that Americans trust it. They believe what Wolf is telling them. They don't question it.  ***  I also hate people who watch Dr. Phil. I want to scream  Hey arseholes, use that hour of your life to get off your fat, donut eating, kraft dinner making, beige sweatpant wearing lard asses and get on a treadmill.   Because I know for a fact that everyone who watches Dr. Phil religiously is either fat, was fat or is going to be fat.  They all act as if he is a god or something. He's robbing five hours from their lives a week! Hours they will never get back!  If I believed that they spent as much or more than 5 hours a week working on their own issues, I wouldn't hate the idea of softcore psychiatry so much. But they don't! They listen to him yak for an hour, they listen to the slutty bad girls, the uncommunicative fat husbands, the depressed mothers, they nod their fat, wobbly heads and go "Yeah, that Dr. Phil, he's so smart." and then they're screaming at their kids to shut the fuck up with that music, or go out and play in traffic or whatever.  It makes me sick. Once I was talking to this old friend of mine and she was telling me that she gets into this really deep conversations with her brother during the commercial breaks but when Dr. Phil comes back on she's like punching him in the arm to shut the fuck up. Her own brother is getting punched in the arm so this girl can hear Dr. Phil drawl about how crack cocaine kills babies. I doubt Dr. Phil would condone that.   Shit tell these assholes to spend 5 hours a week reading instead who knows what could happen. I doubt CNN would be so popular.

						   Vacation:  Ottawa sucked ass because it's what Ottawa does best. Jesus Christ if there was a nation wide sucking contest, Ottawa would finish in the top five.  Oh and if I see one more girl wearing one of those dust ruffle skirts I swear my eyes will vomit.  ***  Didn't do much. Planned to do all this really neat stuff like hang out at the pool all day and read, which sounds a lot cooler than it is which is why I didn't do it. Wanted to get shit done around the house, my apartment is like a shack, it needs so much work. I get a lot of offers from my brother and my guy friends to help with the floors etc, the only thing they seem serious about is knocking down that wall in the living room, which I will gladly do myself with all of the pent-up rage I have. Who needs men.  Anyway... didn't do shit exept for re-arrange my bedroom at 5:00 in the morning so that my bed is closer to the a/c and I can finally sleep at night.  Planned to write a whole lot and did, re-wrote a whole chapter but it started sucking because I can't relate to the lead character anymore. She's all in love with this fabulous guy, meanwhile I'm a one night stand away from becoming a lesbian.  ***  I went to dinner with Pete and Michelle and over chocolate pie, told them how the next person I sleep with will have to be someone I like. 6 hours later I'm riding some mexican I picked up at Ste Sulpice who happened to look like Jim Morrison, which is why I couldn't resist. Like eating more pie because it tastes good even though you're full. Anyway, he had this big fat cock but no idea how to use it. And the next day he was hungover and puked in my wobbly toilet, which would have been hilarious but I was too tired to get up and laugh at him.  ***  Never heard from him again and never used his phone number even though I promised I would because the rule is this:  if, on a scale from 1-10, the sex is less than a 5, you don't get a second chance.   I made this rule becuase I know sex will be bad the first time. It always is. But that doesn't mean that I have anything to prove. Why go through that embarassment and bad times again when I can just dig out the old vibrator and forget bad sex happens to good people?
