       I realized tonight that I don't know my family very well. This thought isn't that disturbing to me, since for the most part they seem to like me, but what does bother me is my aloofness. I'd like to blame it on a selective memory or multiple personalities, somthing exotic and captivating, but I'm pretty sure it's somthing quite mundane. I'm not really into self analysis usualy, but it is 2:30 am, and some of the most interesting things I deal with attempt to be self aware. I suppose I should give it a try myself. Lets go back to my family. I have two parents, each divorced several times. Supposedly this scars children for life. To me it is just life, and I don't fault either of my parents for any of their divorces, nor do I think life would have been better if they had stayed together. Outside of that, there is my Dad's side of the family; we'll call them the French and loving it crowd. There are two sisters , three brothers, and their families on that side. We still have grandma, but grandpa died of brain cancer some time back. The all seem to love a good bit-o-bickering about trivialities with eachother. They are democrats through and through. On my Mom's side are four sisters and their families, along with Grandma and Grandpa. Everyone is super polite, but none of them want to see eachother. Anything said durring a family gathering (once a year) that seems like it might have more personal content than "I went to the GAP yesterday" is snuffed out by everyone going home. Republicans to the Core. I married into a family with a squeaky clean repuataion; my inlaws claim to have avoided liquor until they were late 20's/ early 30's (I think). I was able to hold out until third grade. It's all service and sacrafice for my inlaws; you coulden't ask for nicer people. So, lets count the inlaws out and focus on three questions each about my base families: Why can't my Dad's side make decisions? Why do they never argue with me but always with eachother? Why are they all such pinko commies? For my Moms side: What is this fragile peace holding back, and what was there before? Why do we only meet once a year for about a hour and a half? How much do they, as a group and individualy, spend on sedatives to prepare for that 90 minutes of Christmast?  If you are a family member, feel free to comment. If you are not a family member, but you think you can derive some psyhchological clues or need more info to come up with clues, then comment away. Otherwise, 10-4 over and out.

       Oh boy. It's been about two days since I've had a decent meal. Not that I can't get one.
