      Stocks are the most boring, complicated thing on the earth. I have no idea what I'm doing. I have little to no money to invest. Am I certifiable insane? Possibly. I've narrowed it down to index funds and (when I get a job) a Roth IRA. Now I just have the small problem of buying index funds. They couldn't make it easy...OH NO! Finally figured out to go to Vanguard but I can't understand the crap that they're spewing (are you sensing bitterness? I am.) So if anyone on here knows how to get started PLEASE help me. I'm not asking for advice in which stock to buy but HOW to buy them.  End rant.

      I can remember nothing of import that happened this week. EXCEPT (and there's always going to be an "except" to a statement like that, otherwise why post?)    I went and saw Saved! with Veronica it was hilarious. It managed to make fun of only the right wing freak Christians and not the normalish ones. Very good. Veronica is coming over around one and we're going to Jane's house to go swimming.   My computer is in sad, sad shape. I could almost cry. The caseing around the LCD screen is broken so the screen is wobbling around, held together with various wires, packaging tape, and propped on a pillow.   I did NOT beat Dark Cloud 2. But I can live with it. I went to the last boss and fought an endless number little bosses without being able to save then died against the BOSS. I was not going through that hell again.   I did laundry. I have no job. Went to a party on friday but I left early. I only knew one person there. Apparently right after I left someone came out. I think gay beams follow me...

      Nothing happened today. (If I were a sane person that would be the end of my post HOWEVER...)  Today I played Dark Cloud 2 I'm determined to beat it before I have to return it tomorrow. Never fear. I'll let you know if I win. I talked to Veronica for about 45 minutes today. She's the only person that I can talk to on the phone. The rest of my friends are horrible at it. We came to the conclusion that we're both bored and yet neither one of us wanted to get dressed and do something. Still haven't run out of underwear yet.    Apparently I can only exercise while watching British sitcoms. I've also managed to stay on a diet for THREE whole days! I'm very smug.   Every other word you hear in the media is about "Atkins", "low-carb", etc. I hate it. I'm hoping that everyone on it will suddenly drop dead from kidney failure. Not that that will ever happen because no one's able to stay on it. *sigh* If only I was a god.

      Rambling:  I'm going to admit something to the sparcely populated wilds of cyberspace. I have a fake blog or, to make it even better, a fake FUTURE blog. In this blog I'm living my ideal future. I adore it. I've even made friends in my future city. I'm kind of smirky about it. It's a brilliant plan, I can even switch over once I (hopefully) get to that point.    Have you ever noticed that while watching British sit-coms around midnight the advertisments for community colleges, birth control, "single hot-lines" and "provide a life for your baby, choose abortion" wait...adoption, increase?  Actual Historical Events:  Last night I watched that new Fox show North Shore, I'm horrible desperate for summer shows, I couldn't help but be annoyed by that woman. The sex interest. I automatically hate. everything. about. her. Today I didn't do laundry. Again. I've managed not to do the laundry for several weeks by now. I'm running out of underwear. But the real stopping point is when I run out of pants.   Future Tense:     Tomorrow, someone's whoms codename shall be Veronica, is coming over and we're going to have our own LGBT film festival. I'm bitterly dissapointed that I loaned out all my Queer as Folk dvds. I could have forced her to watch some. All this means that I'll have to clean my room. I should also go out and look for a job. Maybe. Maybe not...

      So I was looking around at blogger for the elusive "gmail" link (it didn't show by the way) and I got hooked. I can't abandon livejournal though. The misery. I suppose I'll just have to do double posts. :)   I don't really mind. It's summer and I have loads of time.  I think I'll make this my absolutely true, very boring non-embelished blog. If some I know actually finds it then they're too obsessed and stalking me.   I'm off to see if there's a profile thingy or a friends list.

      This is my attempt to get a gmail account. I WILL have one...(despite the fact that I only found out about it three mins ago).
