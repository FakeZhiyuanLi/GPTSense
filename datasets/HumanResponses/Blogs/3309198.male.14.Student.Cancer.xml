      for anyone out there that enjoys the arcade game DDR, there is a computer version called Dance With Intensity. If your interested go to http://dwi.ddruk.com/downloads.php you'll have to download the song Not My Battle by gundrill as well. For now thats the only song I can find for free, but I'm sure if you look you'll find more somewhere besides its Hella-Hard!(especialy whe you have to use the keyboard >

      Just letting everyone know the incredible capabilities of the Nintendo DS,Heres one blurb! With its two screens, Nintendo DS instantly shows its innovative face. But capabilities like a touch-screen input, voice recognition and wireless communication set it apart from every other game device, and again demonstrate Nintendo’s passion for groundbreaking originality.  Game players need only use their imagination to see how the DS promises to transform the portable game industry by changing the way gamers relate to their games – and each other. Two screens offer two perspectives on the action at once. The touch screen could make accessing items, moving characters or navigating menus as easy as a tap or drag on the screen. Voice recognition could let players simply tell the game what they want it to do. Chat software will let users transmit text messages, handwriting and even drawings to one another. And wireless functions could link players in the same room – or across the country. The unique features of the Nintendo DS hold a wellspring of potential for the future. Game players will be wowed.   Check it out for yourself  at http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/index.jsp It's incredible! And heres a comment from the President of Square-Enix (Creators of Final Fantasy!)   “I believe that Square Enix has a promising chance in the platform, since Nintendo DS allows users to experience whole new game play with both its input system and its output system.” – Yoichi Wada, president and representative director, Square Enix  Damn this is gonna dent my wallet ^^;

      LIke I mentioned below ( The newest post seem to go to the top) Im a gamer, so I thought I'd suggest a couple sites, some with no relavence to Games at all ^^; www.gscentral.com is full of codes for all systems and even Action replay, www.lunarknights.com is my Final Fantasy 11 Linkshells Site, come here to generally talk about the game, go to www.homestarrunner.com and then go to Sb E-mails for some good laughs, www.battleon.com is a very limited online rpg,www.gunbound.com (it might be .net) is a cool online game similer to Worms armageddon, or go to 2flashgames.com for a lot of cool games, last but not least check out www.newgrounds.com with more...."mature" comedy Don't forget to look at Tommorrows Nobodies and Retarded Animal Babies!
