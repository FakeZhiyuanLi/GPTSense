       Arrrrgghhh!!!!  What happened to my company (LSSB)? I thought that when I got this permanent job as CSE (all benefits+perks included), all the nightmare at MSB are truly gone.  But wait, here it repeats all over again! Oh sure, here you don't have any headaches+tensions like MSB but the pay day are way  late!!! . if on 27-30th then fine by me...but 2nd of  next month!?!?!   But wait! there's more. At MSB, you have a bloody fight just to get you claims approved by the manager. After bloods & tears (and a major cut on the sum of the claim itself) its smooth sailing from there. You can expect the payment by late of next mth!!! Here...easy to apply but... Arrrghhh!!!!  have to wait 2-3mths!!! Some CSE have to wait up to  6mths!!!   ....i gotta find a place to lie down...

       Yesterday, when having lunch with my collegues, one of them kept on questioning me about the virtues of me smoking.   Well, I gave her all of my reasons, but then she pressed on why I can't just simply quit smoking like I've done before. I gave this talk about all preps needed to quit smoking like time period, having something to do and such.   But then, it struck me like  BAAAM!!! . After tinkering with it(having restless sleep in the process) last night, it was me who was holding back on it. The will is there but there is no courage to pursue it.   Here I am contemplating how to better my life in this world, yet this  ABOMINATION , this act of burning money to quickly release yourself from this world is hindering me back. Thanks Fidah, today I'm gonna finish my last pack of ciggies (only 3 left!) and I'm gonna quit after that. But I'm gonna do it hush hush, not like before. After 2-3mths, then I brag about it :-)  Met with NM yesterday, sending her to MidValley to meet with her housemates for some shopping (can't separate the girls from shopping!!!). Tried to tell how I feel for her, but it wasn't the right time. Maybe other times but it better be quick!  Till later....

       Hello world!  Sorry about my last blog, I really don't have time nor the focus on it. But since I settled down on my new job, I think I can start blogging and with a new focus too! Hence, the new title and directions.  New resolutions? Well, first up, I'm going to use this blog as my diary since my forgetfullness is getting serious. So pardon me if my blogs sounded a bit technical and obscure to some, me thinks only me and my my new collegue will understand it better.  About my personal life, I am pursuing back the woman that I love once more (give her name then...'NM' should do it). i don't want to cheat myself by hitching myself to my current girl (let's call her 'NZ'). Sure she nice and all but my feeling for her is just a brother-sister kinda way. Hope NZ understand though. Wish me luck on NM then...  On my financial side, I think I have to frugal. My roadtax & car insurance is due in 5 mths or so and I am missed one mth payment already!!! hope I can scrounge enough money by then.  Hope all my new resolutions can be met...  until next time!

       Assalamualaikum  Whoa! haven't blog for 2 weeks! Man, I'm so sorry about that...  Well, NM doesn't reply my mail, sms and not even bothered to answer my calls? Ppl at my old workplace kept on hankering for me to be with her. But ( a big but!!!), I respect her privacy. Maybe she doesn't satisfied with her carefree life yet. Added to  that her burden have been increased due to those filthy, $#@*&@### albabs who takes only one call per day? Pah! If they wanted that, just replace me here...I'm happily to go back there and get my hands dirty....  One sad note, my dearest bro (he's adopted by my father & coincidencely he is my sis bf) met with near fatal accident last week (midnite on 13th to be precise)! He's okay right now but considering the wrecked saga, I wondered that it was a miracle that he survived. Granted that he had a punctured right lung & cracked hip bones but he survived nonetheless!!! And I wouldn't have it any other way! Alhamdulillah!!!  Hopes that the coming week are not as bad as this one. For now I shall end my post in a muslim's way that I have neglected far too long...  All that are/were good came from Allah... All that are/were bad came from my own self... Wassalam
