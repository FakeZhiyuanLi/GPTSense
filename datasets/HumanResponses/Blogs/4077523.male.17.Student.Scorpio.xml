       Well, it is raining here so I decided to check around some places and find some sites for a rainy day. And they are:     urlLink  http://www.waitallday.com/    ahhh...waitallday.com, I think the name pretty much says it all. I wasn't about to wait though. I don't know why I put this, maybe I can use it to trick someone or something.    urlLink  http://www.bored.com/    I got bored with it.    urlLink  http://www.i-am-bored.com/    is better than   urlLink  http://www.bored.com/     urlLink  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/    I have fun messing with the sound boards on this site but just for warning, there will be some choice words on some of them.    And Best for Last.....(drum roll).....   urlLink  http://www.homestarrunner.com/    I like this site the best. Plenty to do.     I guess that is it for the Rainy Day Review, I should have more and better sites for next month, or next time it rains here. Peace!

         Hey everyone, I'm just kinda bored this morning so I guess I will post another one. I am just sitting here and my family is at a water park, I chose not to go to it because first off I am not really in the mood due to previous circumstances which brought me down, and b I never really liked doing family trips because they seem to be boring. If I did the family vacation myself I would not make it boring.    The youth ministry I am a part of came back from Beach Blast yesterday. B.B. is a camp we go to that we make ourselves. I wasn't able to go because of Band Camp, my band director wouldn't let me go. It is the only trip that I want to go on and really work for even if I go on others. I wish I could have gone because if I did go I wouldn't have been through what I went through this week, and Justin had the nerve to instant message me and say "You missed out."That is the last thing I want to hear, number one because I know I missed out on something better than this, and number two it wasn't my choice to miss out on B.B. because my mom made me, it was her money and at the time I didn't have enough to pay for the trip. It is really hard trying to see what God wants for me even after going through stuff like this. But, I pray I will see and I probably wont see until after it is over and hindsight is a beautiful thing. I could use everyones prayer that reads this, and thanks. -De Colores

         Hey everyone! I just got back from my lunch break, fun, fun, I know. This is my last day at this job and then School starts back for me on the 10th. I am just writing this now because I am bored and there really isn't much else to do. I might do a bit of surfing and stuff before I leave this job today. More than likely I will be doing this again next summer. What is it that I do you ask? Nothing, haha, I just get to sit here and make minimum wage for doin nothing. I think I have worked a total of 4 hours this whole summer and get paid for an 8 hour a day job. Well anyway, i'm gonna go and surf some more so I will probably post later. Peace!

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Hey everyone, my name is Daniel and I live in Mississippi. This is my first blog and first post. I am no where near perfect but I am a Christian.  &nbsp;&nbsp; So what's up people? I am glad I am done with Band Camp for this year and I am so happy it is my last high school band camp, YAY! Yeah, i'm in the band, haha, I am the tuba playa. I think this is the first year I have been in this band where they actually took it seriously and didn't play around (as much).  &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I get to go to my last day at work, it's just a summer job so no more paycheck unless I get a job sometime during the school year. Wow, i'm so tired right now, I can't quit yawning. So anyway, Fly with Christ.

           Hey, tonight was an awsome night. In youth we learned about what worship is and God really spoke to me tonight. I thought I would share the outline he had with yall.  Worship is:   Your mind and heart's affection.  Responding appropriately to Him.  Your posture should be appropriate in worship.   Yall probably think the last one is a bit weird, however if you think about it, it could distract others in worship if you are too laid back or something like that. 2 Scriptures that you can look up are Romans 12:1,2 and Psalms 42:1,2.  Today was an overall good day, I am not sure how I will make it through Chemestry though. I already have a project to do and it will be very difficult to get some of it done. I got out of school before lunch today and ate at Pizza Hut for lunch, then went and helped out a little at the church. After that me and Jarrod (who isn't moving by the way) went to get something and I will tell you more in about a week or less. Well, i've got to go, Adios!

         Hey, Hey, Hey! How's it goin? I had an AWSOME tim last night. The dinner wasn't boring. I have rarely been that hyper, haha. I think it is easy to catch the hyperness around Tiffany. I have never talked so much before and we were able to talk to each other the whole time. And if you are reading this Tiff, Your AWSOME.     Today I just got Road Runner (high-speed internet) YAY, it is about time I finally got it. I love it. Well anyway, i'm gonna go surf some more, c-ya! -Fly with Christ

       The Day Before Yesterday: Went to School, then Church, After Church stayed and helped get the stage for the Big Jermy Camp/Todd Agnue/Seven Places/Sanctus Real/Adam Watts concert. it took until about 10 to 10:30 that night to finish.      Yesterday: Went to School, went to church afterwards. Got to be part of Security at the Concert. It was fun and the Concert Was Awsome. It was delayed for about 30 min. because of the sound check not being done. But, I had a great time, I got to keep some people a certain distance away from the stage and did some other things.      Today: School, and I am about to go to O'Charly's tonight. I will meet Tiff J. there and I just hope it won't be too boring at the Instrumental/Tech party. I don't think it will, it should be fun because we have an awsome group going, even if they are out of school and most married, haha. But they are awsome and a fun group to be around when you get them together, haha. Well anyway, I have to go do some stuff and get ready. God Bless, C-ya!

        Day 1...Today was a different day, a day unlike anyother, a day of joy, a day of sadness, a run of the mill day, a day of joy, and a day of hope, a day like thunder, a day like a stealthy black cat, it was a day of morning, a day of afternoon, a day of......     ......Haha! Howdy, What's up people? I started school today, it was my last first day of high school! It was pretty good, my best first day. Today I went from math to Spanish II to Economics to english to Chemestry to no where(I have no sixth period) to band. Tomorrow is Wednesday and it should be even block so I won't have a seventh period and will be able to leave before lunch. But overall I enjoyed it. About an hour ago I got back from Church Band Practice and it was a bit boring because we didn't play that many songs. But anyway I'm gonna go. C-ya!

           Hey, I got my schedule today for school. But, I have to figure out what I am going to do during 6th period because I don't have one but because of band I have a 7th period. I went to an Ice Cream Party for the seniors today, it was fun but not really alot to do. When it was over the ones that bought a parking space left to paint it. It's hard to believe it's my last year. I'm still trying to decide if I want to buy a senior jersey, I might but i'm not sure. I have until thursday to decide.      Last night Jarrod and I didn't go to Sonny's but we went to Wendy's instead because we couldn't get a group to go. Well, i'm gonna go because I wanna get school over and make it to Thursday and Friday. Peace!

            Hey all! School is starting back this Tuesday and it is finally my last year! And so far it is starting out GREAT! Got back from Geyser Falls yesterday, I have a Jermy Camp concert this Thursday, and Friday me and Tiff J. are going to a dinner with some people from our church. But, it is still up in the air if she can go or not because she still has to ask her parents. Anywho, I would say this is going to be a much better year than last year. I'm so excited. It will be hard but it will be worth it.

          Haha, i've been sunburned today, lol. I know i'll start feeling it soon, haha. Jessica, Ashley, Justin, and I went to Geyser Falls today and had a great time. We did almost all if not all of the rides there and some twice. Jessica wouldn't go on any of the 3 speed slides, but Ashley at least went on the one on the right, the Freefall. On the way home Justin was a bit tired so I drove his truck back, and his truck is a good bit different than mine on the gas and brakes, lol. My feet are sore from today, all that walking, and i'm tired, haha. Well, that is about it just because i'm worn out. -Fly with Christ

            Hey, I was able to make it to see the last half of Blue Collar TV, a new show on the WB. I almost forgot about it. Anywho, I went to the bank today, and that is pretty much it. I'm goin to Geyser Falls tomorrow. I can't wait for that.        School is soon to start back. For me it starts back on Tuesday. I can't believe it's my last year. Now I just have to start thinking about colleges.         Me and Tiff. J earlier were aruging over who got to say bye last over i.m. haha. Also I talked to Tiff H. I kinda thought she was mad at me for something earlier, but i'm glad she isn't. I talked to Justin, Nikki, and some others. Well, i'm gonna go and i'll c-ya later. -Fly With Christ

       Tonight was great. We had Harvey Ellis come and speak at our church and I really enjoyed it. The main thing that stuck out to me was a definition he gave of the word struggle. He basically said that struggle is delayed obedience. And I agree to that. In most cases struggle is caused because we tend to not obey God and try to do it ourselves. Anywho, I just thought I would say that because it really stuck out to me.       I can't wait until Friday. Jessica, Ashley, Justin, and I will go to Geyser Falls (a water park) and hopefully it wont rain and we will have fun. If you could, pray for it not to rain in that area because I know it is supposed to rain there tomorrow, hopefully it wont continue through Friday.      Well, i'm gonna go and post later, like tomorrow or something. -Fly with Christ.

      Hey, I just wanted to say that God has laid it on my heart to post this. Today he has really shown me a great deal and has changed my views on dating. Here I am trying to go out with a girl and if that doesn't work try to find another one who I think has great qualities (alot of them I know are more Christ-like than other girls I have ever known, while in the process they are the most beautiful than others which is hard to find). I have found alot of girls I know have great qualities and had a "crush" on some of them. But, God has spoken to me telling me that It isn't about the Girls, just get your relationship back on track with (God).      Recently I had a big let down with someone I know and it got me down for a while. However, I now realize that all this trying to go out with and thinking about girls has brought me down in my walk. I need to get back up and remember that God is all that matters, He will provide the desires of my heart when it is time.      I know that you probably have heard this alot, but if you really think about it and try to comprehend or understand what it is God is telling me to say you won't be let down. And if you are trying to get a girl friend because of how You feel or what You want or something about You which is the reason that I wanted one, then you don't really love the person you have a "crush" on or think you like. In 1 Corinthians 13:5 it says that Love is not Self-seeking. And think about it, if you are doing it for you to feel better by trying to make someone else feel better or just so you could feel better about you then you don't really need to think about dating until you get your life straight with God.      And don't worry about the question "Is this who God wants for me?" In my opinion He will let you know, so chances are if you have to ask that question it probably isn't the person. Well anyway if anyone finds anything wrong with this post let me know, but I just felt the Holy Spirit leading me to say it. Well C-ya. -Fly With Christ

            Hey, I just got back from evening service at Church. We had this guy named Luke giving a concert there and it was fun. I am really tired. I am glad that I can finally sleep in tomorrow if I can avoid being woke up by someone in my family, it was because of them I didn't get to sleep in Saturday.        Anywho, school starts back on the 10th for me and I really don't want it to. Another thing is I refuse to buy a senior jersey because I am not about to pay 50 dollars for something I will only wear once. They are grey baseball jerseys instead of the traditional football jerseys, normally I would be o.k. with a baseball jersey but these things are UGLY! And I will not buy one from them.        I am hoping to get a digital camera before football season and create a blog with maybe a few others and have it be about the life of a band geek, haha.        Anyway, I g2g, Peace!

          Hey! How's it goin? I just got back from Church today, it was a pretty good sermon. I got to see everyone that finally got back from Beach Blast. At first I really didn't want to go, simply because, I knew what I missed out on and that made me a bit sad. But then I started thinking, it doesn't matter if I went or not, I mean I know I missed out on some fun stuff but, it's not about what I want, it is about what God wants for me. I hope that makes sense and if it doesn't let me know and I will try to rephrase it.      I just wanted to take time to say thanks for the prayers whoever has seen this and prayed for me. They are really helping. Whitney and Dawn, if one or both of you ever stumble across this blog thank you for the prayers also. Chelsey, thanks for being there for me in the past, and being someone I could talk to. Thanks Davis, you tha man!, you have been someone else I could talk to, oh yeah and if you see this Davis, tell Caroline I said Hey!, haha. And thanks Tiffany J. for being a good friend to me.      Oh, and Jay Rod! I know you have moved to Florida, and I am sorry that I didn't have a chance to say bye and I thought you were leaving later. But you have been a great friend and I am glad I know you. I will miss ya! Let me know how things are going.      Well that is all for now, and thanks to anyone I have forgot to mention, I probably forgot a few since I am being rushed. Anywho, please keep praying and I will post later. -Fly With Christ
