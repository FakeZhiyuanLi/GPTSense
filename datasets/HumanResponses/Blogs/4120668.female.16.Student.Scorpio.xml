      decided to take away the "how to make a marian" thing cause its really inaccurate...and i guess its getting boring....haha....and i also removed the poll...cause it reminds me alot of TOK...so bye bye to that too....now i have to find something else to put in place of the making marian thing to contribute to the   'pinkness'   of my page...haha....glad i managed to set up a combined blog with yuan today :D happy happy!!

      today mum called me after school to tell me that her car tire got punctured...her car was stopped near a bus stop opposite from NUS along clementi....this was after she picked my brother up...anyway, i immediately rushed down to where she was in a cab from school...and when i got there, there was this newly hired assistant teacher from hong an's school changing the tire...so she didn't have to call the 'Lexus-help-people' and wait an hour for them to come, and pay $50 just so that they can tow it away....excluding tire replacement costs.....thats why it is  truly  amazing who God sends to helps us when we in a time of need =D

      today was my first day of grade 12....sigh...i feel really  really  old....i still can remember my first day of grade 7 clearly...but i guess thats diff cause i was moving from a all girls school to co-ed...anyway...today wasnt that bad...walked into school with mul...who just became a day student...then finally, came into school and saw reine, who has promised not to cut her hair until october...or she buys me lunch...haha and saw a whole bunch of other people....oh yeah...cheryl with her amazing new look.....haha...  didnt have tok today...YAY...we had tutor group instead...got my schedule which hasnt changed from last year except that i have a new teacher...one of my two business teachers left....even though his lessons were boring he is actually really good...also in tutor group we wrote a letter to ourselves which will be mailed to us from our tutor during our mocks...haha...i feel officially schizophrenic now...  so after the super long tutor group session, we had the usual break...finally saw les, hj and nad again!! nad with new dior glasses....hj...didnt change much....oh and les....haha...nice straightened hair btw !! looks good!! then we had english...got my world lit. essay title...stupid canary...i tell u its a chicken!!! MISS JULIE HAD A PET CHICKEN:P ok ok i'm kidding for those who have never read miss julie...its a canary....*sobb* then after, we had chinese  without  our lovely little smeagle teacher...cause she just gave birth to a 3.4kg smeagle...oh oops...*cough* baby....i really miss her...and her poofy eyes...:P instead we got this other teacher who speaks to us as if we dont understand a thing....Neeeeee.....haaaooooowwww......maaaaahhh???? (NI HAO MA?) just a small example...really got me cracking up during most of class time though....after that....lunch...the usual..but there has been a slight inflation....*gasps* a ten cent increase on the asian food....anyway...that didnt get me down....cause.....I HAVE A FREE PERIOD AFTER LUNCH!!!!  which is why i got home early....first day of school really wasnt toturous...maybe cause i managed to get a top row locker next to darling reine's....but i still dont wanna suffer the rest of grade 12....got the EE, the courseworks, the world lit essay, the chinese oral test/mocks/exam, art exhibition, blah blah blah....

       these days have been rather busy for me...mainly i was trying to get my TOK group partner to come over so that i can add her points into the powerpoint presentation that i have been putting together....it was actually these past two days...thursday and friday...and reine is the most uncontactable person i've ever known...despite the fact that she has two phones...i still cant get to her...i call...no one picks up...i call home...maid says she's gone out....something's seriously wrong with that girl's phone lines...haha...anyhow, i know she's not avoiding me cause she's doing her EE research at the university....but still...actually last night she was going to come over at about 10...but i said to come today would be better...but the computer decided to screw up on her and not let her come to my house:P because we do have to get this done eventually, i guess she and yuri will be coming over together on a school day next week to put their points into the wonderful presentation that i have put together so far...well i think reine might have stopped paying her phone bills...haha...just kidding...hope to see u soon!!!

       Last night, i was brought to TCC for the first time with people from the cell...and guess who i saw... SATAN !! Kai pointed him out to me...okay so this is what he looks like...he was dark skinned (think he was malay), bald, had a long face, and most important of all features, he had a  v-shaped, pointy beard!!  i guess thats what really made him look like satan...haha...and the only thing he lacked was the long red pitch fork :P he didnt even need the two little horns sticking out of his head for him to look more like satan...MWAHAHA
