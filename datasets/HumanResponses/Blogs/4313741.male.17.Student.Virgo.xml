      well I'm off work now... Sarah's probably at work right now and I sit here bored as hell. *sigh* I almost made a very bad mistake when I registered for all of my classes the other day... I was gonna give my class schedule to the scheduling manager at McD's so that she doesn't schedule me while I'm supposed to be in class. that's when I realized that I accidentally registered for two classes that start and end at almost the same time on two days!!!! I almost crapped my pants! so when she sent me on my half hour break I drove home as fast as I could and switched a couple of classes around... luckily I'm still not on any waiting lists. *phew* crisis averted! yay for me and my watchful eye. 8-)  but now I'm bored and there's no one home and there's nothing to do... maybe i'll play spiderman some more... or ocarina of time... I've only beaten that game about 30 times... *sigh* it sucks not having a life! some people may look at me and say... hey he looks like he's on easystreet he's got nothing to do... well that's only half true... i have a lot of stuff to do I just choose not to do it! :P

      I have to work tomorrow at 6 in the f$#%ing morning!!!! I hate working there and i can't wait till i quit! *grump* oh well... I'm off at 2 so that gives me a lot of time afterwards to do stuff. But not with my gf cause she probably works at 3 so it would be kind of pointless to spend 5 mins with her and then have to leave... grrrrrr  Maybe i'll reorganize my room. That should take about 30 years. This place is a frickin mess. *looks around* my computer barely fits on my desk there so much stuff on it!!!  My best friend got me my birthday present today. He got me Spiderman 2 for gamecube. It's pretty cool. I've played it on his x-box so i kind of know what to do already but when i get further it will be more interesting. Sarah's gonna wait until my birthday to give me my present... i don't mind... i like waiting for good things :D at least i'll get to see her on friday for a while before she ahs to go to work... at least that's what i'm planning. What i plan and what actually happens are sometimes two different things... *sigh*

      Well I'm all registered for college now and I got the schedule I wanted which is great because the busiest day i have i have only 3 classes and they're all pretty easy so it shouldn't be too hard. I think I'll get by the first term without too many bumps.  The only bad thing is that my gf is leaving for college soon :( she's going all the way to corvalis for OSU and I'm stuck here in bumsville :'( the only reason she's going to corvalis is cause she's smarter than me... ok i guess that's a good reason but i'm still gonna miss her :(
