      Damn...Curt is too hot. lol. Yes, I'm obsessed with some one that is 11 years older than I am, get over it. He's an awesome guy and he's cool to hang out with. And he plays guitar, big plus for him. lol. But I know I'll never have a chance. He has a girlfriend, a 2 or 3 year old daughter, and a son on the way. Doesn't that suck for me? YES, IT DOES. All of the guys I like are older than me. The youngest is Jake, who is soon to be 17. Then Matt who is 18. And then there's Curt who is 25 going to be 26 on Christmas Eve. Can you say "perfect Christmas Present"?  But I know I can count on Jake and probably Matt. Jake, you really mean alot to me and thank you for always being there for me. Matt, thanks for listening and comforting me. Both of you are amazing guys. If only all guys were like you 3. I'd be in heaven! lol. Well, just wanted to add all of this in because I just got done talkin to Curt although I really wanna talk to Jake right now. And hopefully him and Matt will be online soon. Love all 3 of you lots!  Love to those who care, Mandy

      Well only 9 more days of school. Yay. Everyone else in the fuckin United States is outta school and yet we're still here. lol. Anyhow, I got to talk to Jake *smiles* I can't wait to be with him. He's absolutely amazing. I love you Jacob Robert Brown! *blows a kiss* lol. As you can tell, yea I'm in a better mood. I'll be in an even better mood if I can get some damn hair dye tonight. Black. Again! My roots are showing and it's suckin ass right now. Ugly reddish brown hair of mine. *gags* Hmm...did anything interesting happen today...? Oh that little Kayley whore that I go to school with kept looking at me. I think she's just going out with T.J. for attention. Oh well, eventually he'll see the real her. A preppy, stuck-up, little whore that thinks she can get whatever she wants whenever she wants it. I hope he's happy with that. But him and I are still cool...I think. He hasn't really talked to me since they started hanging out. Yeah, well, what should I expect? I duno if Brendan and that Mary Charles(M.C.) chick are gona go out or not. I hope not. She doesn't deserve him. She talks shit about everyone. But oh well, whatever blows his skirt up. lol. Back to Jake though. I wish I was his girlfriend or something. We may as well go out, we act like it already. He treats me like I'm a princess...I love it! lol. Well, I'm gonna go email some of my peeps and get some pizza. Later!  Love to those who care, Mandy

      Hey Well today has been a long day. I've been tired all day long and sad. I'm not sure why I was sad but it doesn't matter. I went to sleep in Civics Class. No wonder...it's fucking boring. I also had to make my schedule for high school. Yep...I'm starting 9th grade in September. Just PEACHY. I hate this...the guidance councler that was talking about my classes for next year was a bitch! Well I don't have anymore to say about today. Later.  Love to those that care, Mandy   Love ya Crystal

       Hey people, what's up? I'm just sitting here waiting for summer vacation to start. June 17th...12 more long days in Hell. School sucks ass, big time. Anyhow, I guess I'll tell a bit about myself. I'm Amanda but most people call me Mandy.    LOOKS: black hair (originally red) hazel eyes fair skin 5ft 5in 98 lbs.   I'm going to be 14 on August 30th. I'm not really that "popular" in school or anything. I stick to just a small group of friends and tell the rest to fuck off. lol. Most people call me either punk or gothic. Damn stereotypes. I like to listen to music, take pictures(that DOES NOT include getting pictures of me unless I want them taken), draw, meet new people, learn how to play guitar, and think about Curt. lol. No he's not my boyfriend although I wish he was. He's got a girlfriend and he's 25. So basically I have no chance. Oh and also I write poetry and I'm attempting to write lyrics.   Okay now back to my day...it sucked. Just as every other day in school does. I find it pointless to continue through this if you know your basic facts like in math. But no! They wanna make me miserable until I'm 18. I'm ANTI-COLLEGE too. lol. Well this weekend was pretty cool. Friday, "prom night" sucked though. My ex-boyfriend, Brendan, went with someone else to prom and I still care about him and everything. So while he was all kissing on his prom date M.C. I was wandering around being upset(ok I'll admit, I was kinda jealous). So, I was very happy to get home. Saturday my friend Britt and I went swimming in a pool then Curt came over *smiles*. Well from then on out I had a good weekend. Then on Sunday and Monday I talked to Liz and Jake. Liz, my dad's ex-girlfriend, and I talked alot. Jake, a guy that I absolutely love, is a sweetheart. I couldn't ask for a better guy to know. Matt is acting weird around me now. He won't talk and I don't think he really gives a fuck now. I duno what has changed but I hope it changes back. He's an awesome guy. But oh well. I haven't hurt myself lately, thankfully. Well that's all I have to say for now. Oh and Crystal chick, I love ya! Love to those that care, Mandy  P.S. I'll probably post some of my poetry on here too so B-E-W-A-R-E! lol.
