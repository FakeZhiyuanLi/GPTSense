         I don't know what I'm doing.  Going through the motions.  I wish I knew where I was going.  Or why I am here.  I sometimes get these bursts of hope.  Hmmm maybe it won't be so bad afterall.  Maybe I'll somehow figure it out.  Perhaps I'll find out one day that I'm not just sitting on this planet polluting the earth.  And then one breath, one syllable, one word... and suddenly I'm off on a side trail that leads to nowhere.  I've been so good at faking it that I've convinced myself and those close to me that I know where I'm heading.  What a joke.  I have these recurring dreams... But they are only dreams.  If only I was so lucky...........

          Even days, weeks, and months later, I still feel it. Depite the bitterness, I still feel it. Does it ever go away? What a peculiar moment to see someone you love after a month of silence. How two years can fly by in a flicker of lightning and yet a month may seem so endless.  How do you say good-bye to a part of your life that you wish you had back? How can you simply exist in the present while you yearn for those moments that made you feel alive... How do you light that flame that brings afloat the part of your soul you've been shielding in a hidden compartment of your heart? Where do you find that desire and the hope?  I've forgotten how to dream .

       Although we've had some time apart, I feel like it was only yesterday when you embraced me with your boldness, caressing me as I longed for you. At first I took my distance, ignoring all past traces of you near and around me... making myself believe that I was better off without you. I still believe that I am. But I'm  drawn to you  ever so fiercely... You occupy my very first thoughts in the day, and also my very last before I drift off into the night. Everytime we depart, I feel the energy, the life that you eject into me... I can feel it stir in my blood, I can feel it pump my heart... And I can't wait to see you again. I've tried to fight it for too long... I surrender to your overwhelming power. I thought I could live without you. I wished I could go on alone. But something has pulled me back to a place where that memory still lives, and I travel back to meet you.  Ahhh.       ...       Java.

       He doesn't like using CDRW.  He said : Yeah.... using a CDRW is like having a boyfriend.  You take [add time in months]  months to build the confidence and the trust and they they bail...

       Lots of people find arrogance to be slightly appealing. Who doesn't want someone who's loaded with self-confidence, can put a value to their worth, and doesn't feel ridiculous letting other people know how smart they are.  I guess I'm not "lots of people" because I find modesty in person to be quite sexy actually. Better yet, lets stick to 'appealing'. A modest person is likely to be the one with the most self-confidence since they don't feel the need to continuously attract attention to how knowlegeable they are. Nor prove their self-worth to anyone but themselves.  Ah here I go again, procrastinating... I have a million other things I should be doing... (one of them is sleeping). CSS and I are having issues this week.

       People overestimate the stability of my mindset right now. I spend 95% of my time trying to appear motivated and in control when the rest of the time I just want to dig myself a hole. I have so little confidence in myself I am startng to lose respect for those who actually believe I can do anything useful. Can't they see how useless I am?  I don't really want to kill myself, I just want to disappear. I give up. Ya, so I'm weak. I told you so. So what's do disagree with.

         Personne ne m'a jamais dit Qu'on pouvait mourir à trop aimer Je retiens en moi un cri Au fond de ma cage de chair mutilée Vous rapporterez mes paroles A ceux qui ont perdu espoir Qu'ils les voient comme un symbole Annonçant que l'amour remporte toujours la victoire
