      Abe and I have long bemoaned the fact that churches (and Christians in general) tend to worship the Money God over the True God.  In churches we have both worked for in the past, it was common for the first question about any activity to be "how much does it cost?" rather than "is this what God wants us to do?"    I wonder why we Christians can't get it through our thick heads that money just really doesn't matter?  We should just be focused upon pleasing God and accomplishing His will.  He will handle the details.  Makes me mad.

       " urlLink XXXchurch  exists to bring awareness, openness, accountability and recovery to the church, society and individuals in the issues of pornography and to begin to provide solutions through non-judgmental and creative means. XXXchurch is here to make you think, react and to decide where you stand on the issues of porn. We're not here to sling mud, but to shove the envelope and try and do some good. "   Finely, someone who takes the subject of pornography seriously enough to talk openly about it! I came upon this site some time ago and was happy to see that someone is daring to talk about this widespread problem. I preached a series of sermons on this subject one time and was rather surprised at the results. The church leadership became very angry at me (for the first time). They insisted that there was no one in the congregation with that kind of problem and that I was wasting my time. However, during the series, I had two different families come into my office admitting their struggle with this sin. Let's talk about it because it's real, and it's everywhere.    urlLink Setting Captives Free  is another good site I found.  Check it out for help with all kinds of habitual problem areas.
