      So, I'm sitting here watching the big Eukanuba AKC dog show on the Discovery channel, and they just did a little side piece about service dogs.  Now let me say that A#1, I love dogs.  B#2, I think service dogs are some of the coolest things EVER.  But they featured this police dog that was six years old, had won all kinds of awards, and so on.  Well, at six, it had started to go blind.  By eight, it would be completely blind.    So the officer he worked with decided to retire him from service and do kind of a motivational speaking thing with the dog.  Okay, that's cool, I guess.  But they took the dog to the Missouri School for the Blind.  Wait... what?!?  Why did they do that?  Those kids are blind.  They don't know what the fuck is going on in front of them.  They had the blind dog doing tricks so the blind kids could  not watch .  Did they describe what the dog was doing to the kids?  Did they make anything up?  For all the kids knew, they could have said the dog was driving around the room on a minibike.  And that's cruel!  That's like farting on someone who can't smell.

      The most heinous thing happened last night.  Bear with me, as I have to ramp up to telling you what it is.  If not, I would risk your face melting off, much like the Nazis in  Raiders of the Lost Ark .    So, I spent the night at my girlfriend's house last night.  We're both young and have above average sex drives, so naturally we were doing it.  Hard.  Everything's going along great, all the usual writhing and moaning, when it happens.  She farted.  People fart, you know?  Whatever.  Big deal.  We've been together long enough that that sort of thing doesn't even faze us anymore.  You just laugh it off.  Right?   No.   See, in addition to being young and libidinous (libiduos?  Filled to the brim with the steaming broth of testrogenticular sex jelly? whatever.), we're also quite limber and adventurous.  Not like, doing-it-on-a-display-bed-at-the JCPenny's adventurous, but we'll fool around in unusual holes.  The thing is, I was going down on her at the moment of unpleasantness.  Point of fact, I was at that moment fooling around in an unusual hole.  I was in the middle of salad tossing at the time of eruption.  The launch pad was still occupied at the moment of liftoff.   My girlfriend farted into my mouth.   I was...  I was in shock.  A lot of things go through a man's head when he catches a mouthful of methane.  -Wow.  What was that? -Oh God.  I just ate a fart.  Don't swallow, man, don't swallow! -Why can't I taste this?   -Should I say something? -Why is she laughing?  It's hard to say if I would have eventually snapped out of it on my own or not.  My girlfriend, possibly expressing her shock differently, sat bolt upright in bed, kicking me in the face in the process.  When I came to, the paramedics told me that my girlfriend called 911 because she was afraid that the fart had gone straight into my brain and destroyed my frontal lobe.  The paramedics performed a quick exam and determined I was fine, just a sore nose.  I thanked them and walked them to the front door.  On their way out, one turned, and I realized what was going to happen too late.  I rushed to close the door, but I was finished before I had begun.  "You two be careful.  Just remember...  crack kills."  *        * Okay, that was fucking weak to end it like that.  Sorry.  Up until my going unconscious though, it's all true.  I really ate a fart.  Let's call it a wash.

      This has been an absolute motherfucker of a week.  Valentine's night, I threw my back out.  Yes, it happened exactly the way you think it did.  Yes, it was worth it.  Luckily, my back healed up just in time for some fucking animal piece of trash to steal two loads of my laundry from my apartment's laundry room.  Who does that?  How does someone even arrive at that as a crime?  What kind of mental patient drives through a strange apartment complex looking for clothing to steal?  It could have been worse, I know.  I lost all my work clothes, but they were ratty, so that didn't hurt too much.  But they got like, almost all of my favorite t-shirts as well as pretty much all of my underwear and socks.  They left my best pair of drawers and  THREE MISMATCHED SOCKS .  So now I don't even have a fucking matching pair of socks.  I talk big a lot, I know, but if I ever see anyone wearing any of my clothes around here, I'm going to chase them down and throw them into the highway.  But who am I kidding, it was just some fucker looking to make some easy money at the thrift shop.    That's not the worst of it though.  I got off light this week.  Friday night, I went to spend the night with my girlfriend.  Saturday morning, we're getting ready to head to the gym, when someone starts frantically knocking on her door and ringing her doorbell.  She opens the door, and there's her crazy sister and her husband.  My girlfriend's mother had died at about five o'clock that morning.  She was only 56 years old.  This is fucked up.  I don't want to sound coarse or flip, but I've had a little time to process it, and that's my best response.  This is completely fucked up.  The jury's officially still out on the cause of death, but there are certainly ideas floating around.  Nothing like foul play, or anything like that, and though I made a promise not to speak a word about it, I will say that it really disturbed me to hear what my girlfriend thinks happened.  The bottom line however, is that cause doesn't really matter.  It's been a while since anyone I know personally has died, and I forgot how harrowing it really is.  It was hard having to see my girlfriend cry like a baby for only two minutes and then snap into her 'crisis mode', because she knows that she's going to be the one who has to spearhead all the arrangements.  It was harder having to see her dad later that day.  That man is absolutely wrecked.  I mostly tried to stay out of the way at the house that afternoon, but a couple of times I caught a glance at her dad, and it was just eerie how distant and hollow that man looked.  It struck me that even though he was the breadwinner of the family, he was almost entirely dependent on her.  He's never really lived on his own; he comes from a big family full of brothers, and they basically married and that's when he moved out to be with her.  She did the cooking, she did the cleaning, she did the laundry, etc.  Now, he's a resourceful man, but it's clear that his whole world came crashing down onto him that morning.  And they're good people.  I mean that.  Anytime something like this happens, everyone rushes to be positive and complimentary, whether or not it's justified, but I  know .  As much as I'd like to be, I'm not a good person.  That's not a 'pity-me' statement, and it's not something I'm proud of, it's just a fact.  I've done some really bad things in my life.  I've  been  doing some really bad things lately.  I know what it's like to be a bad person.  By virtue of that, I can recognize good people, and that was their family to a T.  I got to spend some time with all three of them for the last time about two months ago.  It was neat to get to see my girlfriend's parents really interacting with each other, and really enjoying each other.  We had lunch, and her mom was just as sweet as could be to me.  She was always sweet to me.  She liked me a lot, even from day one, and I appreciated that, because I'm difficult to even talk to, much less like.  Her dad is a great guy too.  He's all about his little girl, and with good reason.  I've always been notoriously bad with fathers, but I think he was just happy that his daughter was happy, and so I was welcomed into the fold.    She told me tonight that her dad wants me to sit with them at the funeral on Tuesday.  I don't know how I feel about that.  I was so taken aback by that.  That's not even a possibility I thought about entertaining.  It says a lot; I'm honored that he would like for me to be there, but at the same time, I don't know how appropriate something like that would be.  I told my girlfriend I'd think about it, and then a little later I told her I would do it.  It's what he wants, it's what she wants, and I'm sure her momma wouldn't have had it any other way.  I called my mom that morning right after we found out.  She lives two streets over from my girlfriend's folks, and I thought she needed to know.  I had to leave a message, and about five seconds in, I broke down.  It all caught up with me right then and there.  I can't remember what exactly I said, but I remember wanting to hurry up and finish talking so I could tell my mom that I loved her.  I've thought about her mortality before and the inevitability that I'll be in this exact situation one day, but it really got hammered home that morning.  Then I cleaned myself up so I could be the crutch for my girlfriend.  The last thing she needed was some crybaby boyfriend hanging around.    As she would say, "That's where you're supposed to laugh".

       Apple doesn't even have the god-damned courtesy to give me a reach around.   My  urlLink iPod , that I was so squishy in the shorts to have won, is a pain in the ass.  Take my advice:  if you ever decide to invest in one, make sure your computer is on the absolute cutting edge of technology.  Get it from DARPA if you can.  Hook it up to the  urlLink WOPR  if at all possible.  I should have known I was in trouble when I went to the radio station to pick it up.  I got horribly lost on the way down there, find the joint, and proceed to get lost  in a TORNADO  trying to find my way back home, out of north Dallas.  It was raining so hard I couldn't even see the highway signs to begin to figure out where I was.  Eventually, I made my way home, and went to visit my girlfriend.  I decided to try the 'iRoid' out at her office, since they have nothing but Macs.  I sat down at her iMac, conveniently already loaded up with iTunes, and started putting some  urlLink Bird  in.    Silly me, I figured an iPod would work fine with an iMac.  Yeah, apparently, iPod needs OS X to work with a Mac.  In fact, it needs a version of OS X that I'm not sure has been invented yet.  Basically, it doesn't get done that night.  Fine.  I bring it home.  My PC is so  urlLink archaic , the CD drive won't even stay closed with the installation disc inside.  So, long story short, I end up dropping the price I  would  have paid for the iPod on a new hard drive and memory upgrade, have my  urlLink dirty  throw Windows 2000 on it (oh yeah - I was still rocking 98 well into 2004), spend the better part of Saturday night/Sunday morning getting shit up and running, only to finally discover that I don't have a firewire port on my machine, nor an adapter to utilize the USB port.  Have you ever seen a grown man spin on his head?  It's quite entertaining.  My last mistake came today when I had to go to CompUSA to look for an adpter of some sort.  After searching for 15 minutes, I finally grab a guy to help me find what I need.   A) His grasp of the english language was tenuous at best.   B) He was visibly annoyed that I had found him in the first place. C) In lieu of answering my questions, he simply started walking towards where I had been looking, and picked up another connector  IDENTICAL TO THE ONE THAT I HAD IN MY HAND .  "Thank you so much for your help.  If this doesn't work, I'm coming back here for you."  Lo and behold though, Nusram knew what he was motioning towards.  My iPod finally has music on it.  You know what?  Just skip it.  Don't buy an iPod.

       Asperger's Syndrome Skibble-Jabang Jabop.   Today was one of my best days off, EVER.  I got to sleep in this morning.  I got a few more pages of my comic written.  And they're good.  Really good.  I imagine I'll have to move a lot around when I crack down on the editing, but the actual dialogue just kills.  Then I won an iPod from  urlLink Pugs and Kelly .    Fucking.   RULE .  Plus, I found out  urlLink TV on the Radio  will be coming to town near the end of the month.  If Prince had any sense left in his head, he'd hire these guys to be the new Revolution.    Dinner was nachos.

      Hey blog!  What's ^?  Sorry I haven't written in you for so long, but you understand!    Ugh.  Tonight was one of those nights I got bummed for no particular reason.  Nothing bad happened today, just... thhpptt.  It's whatever.  I'll get up tomorrow morning, and it'll be all good.  Word to the wise.   urlLink Bad Santa  is a fucking horrible movie.  It's clunky, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly edited, and vulgar beyond the point of funny.  I know, I know... I curse.  A fucking assload, I curse.  But this was just cursing for cursing's sake.  They could have easily cut half of the 'fucks' and 'shits' out, made it PG-13, and had a  way  funnier movie.  Hell, leave the dialogue intact, the structure is what killed this movie.  It's a good premise, and I'd like to see a good version of this made someday.  But I really don't think I've seen a movie with less direction and flow since MST3K showed  urlLink this .  Thank god I got it under my  urlLink Blockbuster movie pass .  I would have been royally twisted had I paid full price to rent it, and not had the chance to get 1000 more movies to make up for it.  What else?  My comic is being painted as we speak.  One of the girls I work with is an artist and I asked her if she'd be interested in doing my book with me.  She was, and is.  I had some fears at first, notably when she said, "I'm about to start doing the final layouts, and I was wondering...  where are you going to put all the words?"  "Well, I was kind of hoping in the process, you'd leave some space for them."  "Okay, cool."  She's doing it in watercolors, which is going to be  urlLink tits .  Someone'll put it out, I know that much for sure.  I've had saleable  urlLink ideas  that I've had to shelve because someone else got the jump on me with similar stories.  Not identical, just similar enough to piss me off real good.  What else... My bestest  urlLink buddy  and his wife moved to  urlLink Boston  for schooling.  That bummed me out pretty good, but at the same time, I'm way stoked for them.  I'm glad they were able to figure out how to do it, and made it up there virtually incident-free.  I sent them some wicked hot  urlLink bamboo  for teh housewarming.  Well... that's all I got.   urlLink These fuckers  are  OLD .  Their  urlLink game  is weak as well.  I show them disdain!  Listen to  urlLink this  and/or  urlLink this  instead.  They are ear-delicious.

      As you can probably imagine, being a liberal in Texas is a pretty lonely endeavor. If every Republican in Texas were to fart simultaneously, we'd all be dead. Even on supposedly friendly turf,  urlLink Texas Democrats get the high hard one .  Not to mention that for all the hype surrounding the various bloggers covering the DNC, there is precious little commentary coming from below the Mason-Dixon line. I decided to hit the streets and do something about that. By 'hit the streets', I of course mean, 'went to the mall'.  I arrived at the mall, purpose in my heart, and humidity thick in my lungs. I had my mission, and I had my means. But where to begin?  Think, Pooh, think... you want response about the DNC... the DNC is pushing hard this year for the youth vote...  of course . Logic galloped across the finsh line of my mind, with that time a black girl gave me a handjob coming in a close second. I made my way downstairs to the childrens' play area.  Bodies writhed their way in and out of cartoonishly oversized barrels and fake plastic replicas of the local landmarks. The screeching was almost unbearable, but I soldiered on, bravely. I sized up the crowd and found my first target.  He was a young man of perhaps six or seven, and as I approached him, he seemed less wary of me than I might have thought. I asked him for his thoughts on the convention. I told him I was an independent journalist, and promised him anonymity in exchange for a quote or two.  "My name's Mitch." he offered up immediately. So much for anonymity.  "What are your impressions of the general tone of the convention this year as compared to years past? Specifically, the attitude towards many of the speakers and prominent Democrats held by many members of the constituency viewing them as something akin to rock stars and celebrities?" I asked him.  "I'm going to Six Flags tomorrow. But you can't tell my sister, it's a surprise. Do you know my sister?"  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to read between those lines. I got his message: 'I come from money. Therefore, I'm better than you, and I've got Dubya to thank. I'd sooner lick a bum's nutsack than see Kerry in the white house. Get a real job, hippie!'  I threw my hands up, showing that I meant no offense. Just my luck to pick a young Republican as my first interview.  Little did I know, I had only begun to scratch the surface.  I spied a young girl sitting nearby, and after introducing myself, asked her what she thought of Al Sharpton, and the possibility of the black community being an important factor as the swing vote.  "My bike is fast. FAST!"  "I see... so you feel that the Tawana Brawley scandal is still too closely linked with Sharpton to..."  "I go go play now."  Damn! I had walked right into that one! I was slowly being consumed by this pit of vipers. I decided to go for the hail mary, and give it one last shot. Next to the super slide, there sat a cherubic lad gazing into the abyss of his free mortgage company balloon.  "Hi, I was wondering if I could get a couple of thoughts from you concerning the Democratic National Convention and the impending election."  "Aggle baggle gaggle laggle!"  "  YOU SON OF A BITCH!  " I had had enough. I would not sit here and take this abuse from a cadre of pre-adolescent, jackbooted thugs. "  YOU SKULL &amp; BONES MOTHERFUCKER! HOW DARE YOU TAKE THAT TONE WITH ME!  "  I popped his balloon with my car keys (not as easy as you'd think-I drive a Honda), and vaulted the googly-eyed giraffe to the sweet air of the free press.

       INTERNAL MEMO - NOT FOR RELEASE - INTERNAL MEMO   From: Jeff Shipley, Grand Dragon of Marketing/Public Relations To: Grand Wizard of the KKK, All Grand Dragons of the KKK, Area Recruitment Heads, and Shift Managers   Hey gang-  Jeff Shipley here,  thrilled  to be working with the Ku Klux Klan. Little background on me: I’m 31 years old, spent the last three with Pierce & Banner PR after leaving MPACT Marketing. Married, no kids (unless you count our dachshund Contessa!), and a sweet summer duplex in Portland.  I was hired to help bring the Klan up to date with today’s marketing. Folks, public opinion is worth a lot. It can literally make or break you. Literally. Historically, the Klan has always been at odds with public opinion. I’m here to change all that.  I’ve looked at the facts and figures, and talked to a number of you personally, and I think I just might have a plan. A 4-Point plan to make the KKK bigger and better than ever before!   Point-1: The Blacks   I know, I know, I just hit you with the big one right off. Well frankly, I just don’t have time to screw around. Not if I’m going to get this ship back on track. I understand several of you have a lot of anger and bitterness towards the increasing number of black celebrities in the world; rap artists, professional athletes, etc. Yes, more black people enjoy fame and fortune than ever before, but look at the overall picture: the numbers of black people involved in serious crime has climbed higher than ever, civil rights are constantly being ignored, and discrimination has been holding steady for the past 5 years. Don’t let a few good apples spoil the bunch.  And another thing: let’s cut out using the ‘n’ word. I know how fond of it many of you are, but let’s face it: due to the acceptance of the word within black culture, they mostly don’t care. It was high time to let it go, anyway. I mean, we don’t still ride around on horseback when we burn churches, right?   Point-2: The Hispanics   The good news is the so-called ‘Latin explosion’ in popular culture never really materialized. The bad news is that statistics show that by the year 2010, Hispanics will become the majority, surpassing Caucasians. This means we have to start making more proud white people. So let’s get started on this as soon as possible. 2010 isn’t that far away, and your retarded cousin isn’t going to get pregnant by herself.   Point-3: The Gays   Gay culture is constantly making new inroads with mainstream pop culture through television shows, movies and other machinations of the Homosexual-Jewish conspiracy in Hollywood. Rather than attack, I say we use them to our own advantage.  David Duke was arguably the most visible leader of the Klan, and look at the man! No wonder he lost the governor’s race in Louisiana! Duke wants to run for Congress when he’s released from prison later this year, and someone’s obviously set the wayback machine for 1988! I’ve got a call out to 2 of the 5 ‘Queer Eye for the Straight Guy’ guys, and hopefully (fingers crossed!) we’ll have David ready for his inauguration photos in no time!   Point-4: The Kids   This is really the backbone of the whole plan. We need to stop thinking in the now, and think in the  after -now. Young people are not as in touch with racism as they once were. Sure,  your  kids know white from wrong, but what about their friends, their schoolmates? To that end, I give you the official mascot of our new children’s recruitment campaign, Krakker Jack!        Krakker Jack is a sprightly, anthropomorphized butter cracker that helps teach kids all about the KKK with his ‘Krakker Jack Facts’!     A Mexican stole your daddy’s job! Arabs smell! Don’t trust a Jew with your money! Black people have extra muscles in their legs. That’s why they’re so good at sports!    This, more than any other initiative, must really be a team effort. Make every Klan function into a family function. Everyone loves a parade! Turn rallies into singalongs! Cross burnings into cookouts! Nothing says family like the Klan and s’mores!  By all means folks, this is just the beginning. I’m totally open to any suggestions you might have. Feel free to give me a call, and I’ll be happy to talk. Unless I’m not there, then Donna will take a message.    Jeff    Originally published at  urlLink damntheman.net -7/21/2004

             Rocco Siffredi                 Dearest my the fans-  I am apologizing first for my English. She is not so good. Without doubting, I am sure you know that I,   urlLink  Rocco Siffredi: Italian Porn King    have decided to retire from the porning.  I remember when I was young, I see many old men with young, hot pussy in porn. I say then, "How disgusting! Old man should not be fucking such pussy!" Then I turn 40. I look in mirror one day and say, "Rocco. You are old man. You are not German. Stop the porn." So I stop.  I have wife and family that I love very much and want to spend time with. Surely you say to yourself or another someone in the area, "Rocco has the wife? Does he give her the toilet love like in his movies?"  Do not ask the silliness.  Work is work, where I put the girl in the toilet. My wife knows the work sex is not the love sex. I make the love sex to the wife, and do not put her head in the toilet. We have a bidet.  Ha HA! I am making the joke.  Do not have the fear. Rocco still wants to direct and produce movies, just not to be on the camera fucking fannies. Perhaps even one day, my son young Fabrizio will grow to take my place. "But Rocco," you say, "is it right for child to have father who makes love to lactating mommas on the camera for the porning?" No to worry. I teach young Fabrizio early that to have oral favors on toilet is act of love. All women should have respect from men, even if woman is tied up with electrical tape and wearing hood with zippers on eyes.  What will Rocco miss the most? The plumpers, the teenies, the doms, DP's, Three-P's, gang fucks, fistings, toe sucking, turtle huffing, preening the cat, red barons, dirty sanchezes, flying dutchmen, dick whipping, blumpkins, donkey punches, Tony Danzas, pearl necklaces, purple mushrooms, jelly donuts, dogs in bathtubs, rim jobs, Cool Hand Lukes, jersey turnpikes, rear admirals,buttplugs and the so on?  I will miss it all.  Love, Rocco.     Originally published at  urlLink damntheman.net -7/16/2004

       urlLink Goddamn, this is so smart.   That'll totally lock up the youth vote.   urlLink Talk   urlLink radio  picked a bad week to take off.  I remember watching that first big democrat debate with  urlLink J & D .   urlLink Kerry  and  urlLink Dean  were bending the wills of those opposed, while poor  urlLink Al Sharpton  and sweet little  urlLink  Dennis Kucinich  were hugging in the corner.  And bouncing along Kerry came  urlLink Edwards , very much the toady to his bully if you will.  Dean was  urlLink Ralphie .       Wait... what?

       KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON'S ASS HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO EAT HER OWN HEAD!!!   You know what the  urlLink EFF  is, right?  It's a non-profit organization dedicated to keeping folks like you and I from getting the screws put to us by such things as the  urlLink RIAA , the legislation and effects of the  urlLink DMCA , and the batshit insanity of the  urlLink US Patriot Act .  They provide a forum and resources for the average joe concerned about these issues to help make their voices heard, and hopefully do something to prevent/fix some of the damage that these bills and agencies are responsible for in society.  They're good folks, and I like them.  Recently, they sent out their newest newsletter, along with an article about the new  urlLink Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act , as well as a prepared letter that you could send to your senatorial representative, in an effort to show your opposition to the proposed increase of obscenity fines based on a completely arbitrary set of guidlines.  My particular senator is  urlLink Kay Bailey Hutchison .  This is her reply:   Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 2056, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004.  I welcome your thoughts and comments on the issue.   I know this is true, because the letter came scented with  urlLink 'Bijan for Women' , and all the i's were dotted with hearts.   This legislation was introduced by Senator Sam Brownback, on February 9, 2004, to strengthen the  urlLink FCC's  indecency standards and hearing process.  Specifically, it would increase tenfold FCC fines for broadcasts of obscence material to $275,000 per violation.   This is perhaps the most  un -specific statement I've ever seen.  First, what's obscene?  Who decides?  What are the guidlines?  Is it zero-tolerance?  Will it be retroactive?  Of course these questions are not answered in the letter.  These answers have not even been addressed by the FCC themselves.  It's completely open-ended and random.  Second, the Kay Bailey as well as the FCC are using the word 'violation' interchangably with the word 'instance'.  In other words, every instance of an "obscene broadcast" carries a fine.  For example, during this year's Super Bowl, let's say CBS had 100 affiliates across the country carrying the game.  They had more, but 100 is a nice, easy number to work with.  Once Janet's evil, dirty titty made it's appearance, under these new guidlines, CBS would have stood to lose $27,500,000 in fines because each of these stations carried the broadcast, and of course, the community isn't smart enough to determine their own standards of decency.   The fines would escalate to $375,000 for a second offense and $500,000 for a third.  The bill would also authorize the FCC to revoke a broadcaster's license after three violations and impose fines on individuals in addition to broadcasters.   This is ludicrous.  Letting the FCC levy fines against individual broadcasters is akin to letting air traffic controllers levy fines against airline pilots because they don't like the way they fly their planes.   That's  what the FCC was originally formed to do, basically manage traffic on the airwaves.     I have received thousands of complaints from constituents in recent months about indecent material on radio and television, and I am particularly worried about the impact of such behavior on impressionable children.   What?  If you're so worried about the impressionable children, why don't you sit with them after they watch something like that, and explain it to them?  If they're so impressionable, make sure that  you  make a good impression on them.     Last year, I wrote FCC Chairman Michael Powell expressing my disapproval of his panel's October 2003 ruling that a certain four-letter word is obscene only when used a a verb.   Well, fucking A.  Alright, I'm halfway with the Kay Bailey on this.  That was just weird.  So if someone  is  a fuck, that's okay, but if you fuck someone, that's obscene.  Taste the  urlLink irony ...   Increased fines should send a strong message to the FCC to use its authority to protect our children and to broadcasters to provide more wholseome programming.   The FCC doesn't need another excuse to flex its muscles.  They've got way too much power as it is, and the job they  urlLink should  be doing is going largely ignored.   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportaion Committee, on which I serve, recently approved S. 2056, and it now awaits consideration by the full Senate.  I support efforts to make broadcasters responsible for their programming and help ensure the appropriatemess of free public broadcasts.  I hope the FCC will harshly sanction and fine those broadcasters which refuse to adhere to Commision standards and make greater efforts to safeguard our youth from indecent programming.   Take a piece of bread.  Spread a little mustard on it, maybe some Miracle Whip if you like.  Now take your favorite lunchmeat (I'm partial to  urlLink baloney  myself), and slap a piece or two on the bread.  Add some cheese if you'd like.  Lettuce?  Sure, why not.  A litte more mustard on another piece of bread, and that goes on top.  Now have a bite.  Chew it up, and swallow.  Continue until the sandwich is gone.  Now your stomach goes to work, the acid inside working to break the sandwich down as the intestinal walls absorb all of the various nutrients and calories.  Some of those calories will be stored as fat, and some will be sent to your muscles.  The muscles will take these calories and convert them to energy.  Use that energy, put those muscles to the test, and get up, walk across the room, and turn the god-damned radio off, you dumb whore.  Did anyone in your office even read my letter?  Did you take more than three seconds to look for any more than the letters FCC and assume that I was too retarded to not change the station?  I don't need you to tell me what I already know.  I need you to listen to your constituents, and do the job you were hired to do.   Should you have complaints or inquiries, you may file them via the FCC's toll-free consumer line at 1-888-225-5322, via e-mail at fccinfo@fcc.gov or the Commission's website at http://www.fcc.gov.   Oh goody!  Just what I always, sort of, not really ever wanted!   I appreciate hearing from you and hope you will not hesitate to keep in touch on any issue of concern to you.   Of course you hope that.  You don't give a  urlLink fat rat's ass  what I think, much less what I write.  So why not send you a letter?  You're not gonna read it anyway.   urlLink Please   urlLink Vote   urlLink For   urlLink John Kerry .  On the lighter side,  urlLink Dodgeball  is very enjoyable movie.  It takes a little while to get going but by the time they make it to the tournament, it starts to get really good.  Pretty sophisticated humor too.  Seriously.

      So, in 2000, Bush vehemently opposed the creation of a flat tax.  Now it would seem that  urlLink there's a pretty significant groundswell of Republican support  for  a flat, ahem, 'value added tax' .  Oh, and they want to completely dismantle the IRS.  Did I say that?  That's important.  I don't believe it for a single second.

       Disclaimer:   I like Marlene. She seems to be doing very well, last time I saw her. She's married, and expecting her first ankle biter. To my knowledge, she has never even seen a drug of any kind. That being said, this was too good to pass up. I'm sure I don't know why this was written and sent out to my friends back in high school, and I'm even more sure I don't know why I have a copy after more than eight years. I feel confident that this will be of interest to all of  maybe  five people in the world, and my only reason for posting this is just that it's fun sometimes to look back and see how out of our goddamned minds we once were. All typos are intended.   Subj: t-shirt talk Date: 96-03-28 01:29:02 EST From: MARLENE225 To: Sara, Josh, Eliz93 CC: Snitram, UNTScout  This is a very good example of what can happen to a person after too much sleep, too much stress, too much caffeine, and too much English!!!   T-SHIRT TALK------by marlene ******    Do people tend to psychoanalyze everything? I mean if you maintain a certain perspective isn't everything or doesn't everything become an expansive, extensive metaphor? Why do we manage to create a world full of comparisons-can't we see anything just as it is-"unmisted by love or dislike"...or is it truly- "a tale told by an idiot"... Take the ultimate example---"life"--For all the great people that have ever existed has anyone ever managed to find a single,consistent definition? Or is life truly undefineable? Life is "like" or "as" many things- a journey, a box of chocolates, a rollercoaster, a flowing river, a mountain climb...etc.------BUT WHAT IS IT?? Do people use metaphors,similies-figurative language and all that other good "stuff" as ways to sidestep the true meaning in things? Everyhting seems to be dressed up in some kind of imagery....Why such a fascade? Is there never anything straightforward and honest? Are we really that starved for adjectives and colorful language? Take me--If I wanted to find a bizarre way to describe my personality--alterego, whatever you want to call it---I could always find a comparison-generic, commercial, conformist--it really doesn't matter. I could talk a whole lot without really revealing anything that significant. I could say that "I am like a white t-shirt with a whole lot of Dr.Pepper stains on it. Now -stretch our imaginations--O.K.--- white symbolizes purity and stains obviously make the t-shirt somewhat tainted. Sometimes the stains are gone-washed away. and the t-shirt becomes fresh and clean-comfortable to wear and appealing to others. But after a while even the neatest of t-shirts gets dirty and tainted--and if neglected it may start to reak an odor 'horriffic" to others and miserables to wear. One often wishes to be able to shred the cursed garmet-- but does not for the fear of indecency. But what is indecency? Is it more indecent to don a putrid, foul smelling t-shirt, or to expose something more compelling underneath? Which would we rather? How often do we wash out t-shirts? Are most t-shirts even white? They could be black, red, or tyedyed for that matter-- Do our t-shirts even feign a glimpse of purity-white? Is another shade of color more provoking or less difficult to attain for that matter? What defines the difference between a white and a black t-shirt? Is it symbolic that one color absorbs the sun and the other does not? How much sun can a tyedyed t-shirt absorb? How does a t-shirt fit?-not to mention how does it look. Is a t-shirt tight,oversized,sleeveless,tanktop, or if we dare--croptop---?? Why is a simple white t-shirt never good enough? When we change t-shirts, do we do so for:necessity, personal, or secondary satisfaction? Or do the three options correspond with each other? Or--here's a left-wing alternative--perhaps we change to establish variety for the sake of maintaing sanity. What determines comfort in a t-shirt? Is it acquired or does it come naturally? Some people seem destined to be comfortable or uncomfortable--no matter what fit or style. And if t-shirts themselves aren't enough for you--stop to consider satins. Perhaps I'm lucky to have a t-shirt with only Dr.pepper stains to taint it. After all, there are much bigger stains..."Down the road between hither and yon". Some t-shirts are inflicted with nail polish and permanent marker---Some have even managed to come into contact with the most nitty gritty--GREASE!!!! Some are even self inflicted stains....Perhaps a paint stain or two in the hopes of achieving aesthetic approval, or perhaps a failed attempt to become an aberration from the masses of white cotton and polyester. T-shirts are often likely to be the direct result of..."rasied hopes and failed expectations"..a la Toni Morrison. Which is a t-shirt stain more "abhorrent"- a stain from a 1st,2nd, or 3rd party? Is it better to have ketchup on your shirt because you put it there or because someone else did? Does the ketchup look the same regardless of who spilt it? Or are you just paranoid--maybe no one cares if you have ketchup on your shirt--Why should they? What makes certain stains more noticeable and significant? How should you go about gettin a new shirt if the one you have has a stain DEEMed irrevmovable----How many stains determine the breaking point between a clean and a tainted shirt? What if you don't want a new shirt but everyone else thinks that you really need one? Who determines our desires? Is the appearance and attire of a certain t-shirt always hereditary? Why do we somehow tend to wear the same shirts as our parents? Are such habits involuntary? How do we avoid such habits? Should they be avoided? Why do some people deter from such hereditary pathways? Whay do we try so hard to remove certain stains but leave others so obvious? WHY? WHY? WHY?.... WHY DO WE BOTHER TO WEAR AND TAINT OUR T-SHIRTS?????????????      don't ask  WHY---this was a completely spontaneous/capricious effort on my part.   MARLENIE RENEE ******

      Dear God.  Alfred Hitchcock was once asked what he thought of a movie just after he'd seen it.  He said "You should never even talk about a film if you've only seen it once."

      The link shows you where we live in Malden, MA.  Its a small suburb of Boston, a bit to the north.  As you can see by the ridiculous, non-gridded layout of our little bit of New England, Boston is really hard to get around.  For a long time, the story I heard about why Boston's layout was so random and evil was because of cattle-grazing in the bad old days: townships would set up fields for their citizen's cows to graze in, fence them off with deference to the lay of the land, hills, valleys, and whatnot, and then industry came around and built cities where the pastures used to be.  Upon doing more research about Boston, I discovered that this was not entirely true.  What actually happened was that people moving to Massachusetts from overseas would just put their houses wherever they wanted when they got here, without any mind to streets or city planning.  And so, in the year 2004, streetlights predict and direct angles of driving which are impossible to calculate and for some reason, streets change names and designations 8 times across 10 blocks of length, and there are no street signs telling you where you are when you need them.  And by "when you need them" I mean "when you are attempting to drive someplace only 3 miles away".     MOVE-IN STATUS     The movers showed up on Saturday.  Because Malden apparently has no concern for the legal height of 13'6" for powerlines, the moving truck couldn't get down my street without pulling all of the powerlines down.  Cost to me: $384.45   Kitchen unpacked. Casualties: LCD display on the front of the microwave   Bedroom unpacked. Casualties: None.   Kitties: way happier now that, like Mom and Dad, they have stuff to sleep on as opposed to Boston's regular cold, hard wooden floors.

      So the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment to the Constitution of the United States entered discussion phase in the Senate Friday.  Being totally fine with the idea of gay marriage, and not wanting to generalize, I became curious as to what arguments against gay marriage have actually lasted long enough to be kicked around on our great nation's legislative floor.  What I found was surprising!   Well, not really surprising at all.    In  urlLink Baehr vs. Miike (Hawaii, First Circuit Court, 1996)  many of the same arguments the Bombs-And-Jesus crowd are slathering about on Capitol Hill were made by the Director of Hawaii's Department of Health.  In short he denied them marriage licenses not based on law but for the following reasons, which I will shred like  urlLink Gator  in part and parcel:    Marriage == an institution between one man and one woman.   Okay, so unfortunately someone let a law get passed recently,  urlLink a Federal Law , that uses this language. This law defines the words "spouse" and "marriage" for the purposes of Federal law as thus:   Section 7.  Definition of 'marriage' and 'spouse' "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling,  regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and  agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal  union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word  'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or  a wife.   According to this law, so long as we call it by some other name, and the newlydudes don't refer to each other as "spouse" in legal documents, everything should be fine, right? They'll get all the same bonuses and penalties for being married, and that would be okay with everybody?  Suppose that one or two words were changed in this document - say "marriage" was suddenly defined as "a union between one Jewish woman and one red-haired man, or one left-handed woman and one punk-rocker man."   Or, even better, how about this: "a union between one Democrat and one Republican of the opposite sex."  I know what you're saying, you're saying "That's totally arbitrary!  Also, what if the Republican man can't find any Democrat women he likes?"  Well, what if, indeed?  I guess he could simply stop being Republican, change the way he's built, and become someone entirely different with totally different viewpoints and opinions and ideas, so that he finds the Democratic woman more palatable!  Sounds terrible, doesn't it?  How could you ask that of someone?!  Well how in the hell can you expect homosexuals to do the same thing?   I'm appalled that a bill like this would even get onto the floor.  And compared to what the GOP is after currently, this doesn't even seem that bad.  It pains me to remember that Clinton was in the White House while this bill was passed.  Many shadowy legislative ninjas refer to this law as a "victory for state's rights" which in a circuitous way it is and isn't.  Sure, Texas doesn't have to legitimize anything Massachusetts does, but also, by the way, here is how marriage is legally defined as told to you by the Beasts On High.  Its bears the distinction of being supportive and destructive to both a central governing power and what I like to refer to as "States that get the vapors".    Marriage is for procreation.   Oh, shit.  Really?  They better come and get my wedding ring, then.   urlLink A short look at this will inform you  that there's 1 single parent for every 100 people in the United States. Total, not out of parents or adults, but 1 in 100 out of the total population. Also, plenty of teenagers are getting knocked up and pumping out units without being married!  Shouldn't these people all be machine-gunned or something?  They are eating up the benefits of marriage without bearing the religious responsibility, what Bush ponders as the weighty cornerstone of civilization, and obviously should be shaved and painted like savages.    Same-sex couples aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.   The punchline here is that most average households in America aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.  I can't tell you how many good, Christian, upstanding citizens let their 2 year olds run around with a 2-liter and a bag of Cheetos.  Or how many regular church-goers I know get drunk and punch up on their kids like Subway Frequent Eater tickets.   urlLink Hetero People that hold true to the American Family Values Religiomatic Platform  TM   in their hearts are sometimes also bad parents!  Imagine how scandalized!   I'm not saying that only Christians beat their kids or refuse and fail to parent them.  I'm saying that most people mistreat their kids.  The three kids I know with gay parents at home are in better shape, are more respectful, and are far more bright than any of these hetereo-raised future tax payers.  And no, they aren't all tiny gay babies or pre-teens.  Oh, and PS, the 12-year old girl raised by the Gaymos certainly doesn't dress like the gutter trash hetero-produced tweens I see at the mall.   urlLink Have you seen   urlLink some of the shit   urlLink kids are wearing these days ?  You're lucky I couldn't figure out who sells the high-heel hooker boots to little girls, or else I'd have a link to that as well.    Gay relationships are immoral, and the sanctity of our awesome American family values must be protected!    We here in the US fight the good fight for the sanctity of marriage and our family values!  In fact, we fight so hard, urlLink  the United States pwnz other countries in the divorce rate category .  This argument is supported only by the moral constructionism found in Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, which have no place in a legislative argument.  There are multiple provsions in the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that provide protection from religious persecution; that's how this country was started.    urlLink MC Bush spun up in his bumpin' radio broadcast  this pearl:   If courts create their own arbitrary definition of marriage as a mere legal contract and cut marriage off from its cultural, religious and natural roots, then the meaning of marriage is lost, and the institution is weakened.  Arguments against:   Any man-made definition of an intangible concept (like marriage, for example) is arbitrary.  The only explicit power the United States Government has ever had concerning marriage is as a mere legal contract.  Church and State are supposed to be strictly forbidden from intermingling, even though it is quite obvious that Jesus built the Bush Election Hot Rod.    The concept of marriage in the world's oldest religions and cultures contains ideas most White Judeo-Christian Taxpaying Weasels would scarcely be able to contain their lunch at.  Multiple wives, savage circumcision, funeral pyres, bridal burning - these are the cultural and religious roots of marriage, you fool.  Christians and some of their more archaic moral ideals are both a chronological and populist minority.    Marriage has no natural roots.  It is largely symbolic and has tax definitions.  That's about it.  The meaning of marriage is a largely personal thing.  To some it is a lifelong promise of something like romantic team loyalty and good sportsmanship.  For others it is a political licensure to appear normal and square.  For some it means nothing at all but obligation.  The institution and meaning of marriage are only as strong and sharply defined as the participants commit to making them.  I know some animals who only got married so they could go to swinger parties.   Listen, I don't want to slam anybody's religion.  Seriously, we all need something to believe in, and I'm not going to tell you that what you want to believe in is wrong.  What DOES happen to be wrong is any sort of religious involvement or participation in our government at any level.  The separation of Church and State is clearly defined and is there for a deluge of really, really good reasons.    Marriages are for ensuring the continuation of the species.    Saying this is equivalent to saying that people who get married and don't have kids threaten the very institution of marriage.  Again, this goes back to the procreation argument.  There was no "must hump" clause in my marriage license.    Marriage is traditionally a heterosexual institution.    Talking about tradition in America is asking for trouble from smartasses like me who pay even a cursory amount of attention to history.  The widespread murder of Indians, the burning of women at the stake for witchcraft, the total disregard of care for the environment, slavery, segregation - all traditional American institutions.  Obviously, in most cases, heterosexual marriage isn't quite as terrible as these things, and  urlLink some people, like John Ashcroft, seem to think things like slave states weren't all that bad.   This argument is totally silly.  It also used to be a tradition to spit in your hand before you shook on a deal or to marry your brother's wife if he died. I'm not even going to talk about this anymore.      Same-sex marriage is an untried social experiment.    So was colonial rebellion against Great Britain.  Also see letting women vote, letting blacks use the same bathroom as whites, and disco.  We're batting .750.   Gay marriage has been legal in Denmark since 1989.   urlLink Many studies  have been done in Europe about divorce rates, marital fidelity and general differences between gay and straight marriages in this nation that has no problem with men getting married to men, women to women, etc.  They have overwhelmingly found that gay couples get married after being together longer, are older at the time of marriage, and stay together much more than hetero couples.  They are also happier in general.  The adultery rates are far lower.   This might come as a surprise to many of you in the God Hates Fags crowd, but when they legalized gay marriage in Denmark, the moral fiber of the nation did not destroy itself, there wasn't anarchy in the streets, and no one has applied to marry their dog.  Also, and I understand this is a fear for many of you, but rest assured that no heterosexuals were forced to marry homosexually.  It is nice to know.  This argument comes from religious figures most of the time, and that isn't surprising.  Just referring to allowing gays to have the same rights as straight people as a "social experiment" sickens me, and it should sicken anyone with any sense of decency.  These people should be tied into sacks and thrown in the river like runty puppies.    Same-sex marriage would start us down a "slippery slope" towards legalized incest, bestial marriage, polygamy and all kinds of other horrible consequences.   As I just stated, none of these things have happened in Denmark.  In fact, Denmark joined Bush's  urlLink Coalition Of The Willing  and helped him carry the flaming sword to the Axis of Evil.  Lets consider this.  Terrorists are, in Bush's own words, enemies of everything we hold dear and civilization itself.  Also, gay marriage will unravel civilization.  Denmark allows gay marriage.  Hence,  DENMARK IS A TERRORIST STATE.  THEY HARBOR IDEALS THAT GO AGAINST THE VERY NATURE OF AMERICAN LIFE.   God knows I'm writing a letter as soon as I finish this piece.  They're fucking terrorists, man.  Obviously we can't consort with them anymore, because they will send us down a slippery slope where all men will be lined up like circus seals!  WE WILL ALL PLAY THE RUSTY TROMBONE AND FUCK OUR SISTERS AND CATS IF WE CONTINUE TO CONSORT WITH THE DIRTY DENMARKIACKS.    Granting gays the right to marry is a "special" right.      I still think forced integration was a mistake. As a government action, I think it was detrimental to whites and blacks. And left alone, it'd have come along -- if you look at the football teams in North Carolina, I tell you, there's scarcely any room for a white boy on 'em!"   -  urlLink Sen. Jesse Helms, December 2, 2002  Straight people can get married. Gay people can't.  Both are humans and as thus are equal in the eyes of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Treating them like second class citizens is no better than saying something like "Uppity Negroes have no right to touch our white women. Or vote."  You silly Cro-Magnon prosophobes.    Sodomy is illegal.   If I could throw every sodomite in jail, I would be the first in line to serve my time.  And it would be a very,  very  long line.  Guess what, hetero nation!  Sodomy isn't just the buttsex between two men.  It is also any sort of oral or anal copulation at all, even between men AND women.  So, if gay people can't get married because of the possibility that they will sodomize each other (which, as a side note, is legislation based upon a potentiality, a lawmaking concept that no one in their right mind would agree to) then the logic stands that anyone who may sodomize each other can't get married at all.  So that means no more marriage.  And no more blow jobs.  And no more investigating the little man in the boat, if you know what I mean.  Although I guess people with no mouths or assholes could get married.  So there you have it.  No marriage for anyone that has a mouth or an asshole, and especially no marriage for anyone who has both.    Terrific Conclusion To This Awesome Report   To sum up, if gay people can get married they aren't going to force you or your kids to have sex with dogs.  Denying them the right to marry is treating them as inferior beings, lesser than their heterosexual counterparts.  All they want is the same rights that straight people have, and there is no good reason, legal or otherwise, that they should not have these rights.  All people in America supposedly have identical rights and opportunities.  I know this is bullshit, and you know this is bullshit, but we're talking about class warriorism when we say that, separating the wolves from the herd.  In the American lexicon of history, we have always been a self-correcting organism, always eventually recognizing our gross impropriety and fixing our blind, frantic mistakes to some extent or another.  The only problem with our current situation is that the blind, panicked animal has the reigns - this time McCarthy sits in the West Wing and shakes his self-righteous fist from a position that seems politically invincible to self-inflicted damage he shouldn't be able to withstand but somehow is.  It is unfortunate.    Nixon was crucified for less than this.

      Oh, its been a busy day.     President Bush declines invitation to speak at NAACP's annual convention  - Citing schedule conflicts, the White House turned down the NAACP's invitation for the 4th year in a row.  Bush accepted the invitation in 2000 when he was running for President;  with this year's refusal he becomes the first sitting President to not attend an NAACP convention since Herbert Hoover.  Come on George, the black vote isn't an entirely lost cause. Besides, there are a bunch of really rich blacks who have benefited MEGA-LARGE from your tax cuts.        Disenfranchised Republican Jay-Z busts a cap in Big Government!

      Okay, I don't have much time today, but I wanted to give you a few updates on some of the stories we've talked about.   Libya, Chad, Darfur, and the Sweathogs:   urlLink BBC NEWS | Africa | Libya to open Darfur aid corridor    Your taxdollars at work in Foreign Countries:  This is an interesting series of stories.     urlLink First, we read about how the House approved a budget bill  for sending aid to foreign countries. This bill set aside an amount that was half what Bush wanted spend of our money.  Then we see that Republicans in the House as well as the Bush administration won a victory by way of  urlLink an amendment to this same bill  that withholds aid to any country that might try and prosecute any agent or representative of the United States for war crimes or human rights violations. (This includes soldiers.)  Then we see that the  urlLink Bush administration took a huge blow in a  bi-partisan amendment , again to this same bill, to withhold aid from Saudi Arabia for generally being bad, shady guys.  Three victories for three disparate parties in one bill.  Who knew government could be so much fun?    The Senate will rip this thing to shreds, I imagine.

      The Republicans in the Senate could not get their act together this week to ban gay marriage. They needed a simple majority to proceed with it and 60 to send it to the states. Because of quarrels over language  within their own ranks  they got destroyed, more or less. Yeah, 48 - 50 doesn't seem so bad, but its worse than it looks.   The big picture guys will tell you that the whole point of this silly business was to get Kerry and Edwards to have to vote against the amendment, which both of them said publicly they did not support. Doing so would have instantly alienated them from a middling chunk of the electorate who may or may not have voted for them in November. See, with large chunks of the voting public, Bush pushing the amendment isn't enough for them to vote for him, and Kerry / Edwards  saying  they would vote against isn't enough for them to vote against Kerry and Edwards, but Kerry and Edwards  actually, really voting against it  would have been going too far, at which point they would cast their vote Party Ugg Two-Legs. People are funny, but voters like this are a real, actionable chunk of the voting public. People like this are why campaign managers sometimes set themselves on fire and then jump out a window.   So the Republicans had a plan to further divide the voters with this windmill of an issue - it is not only mean and regressive but also just about the least important of all the issues facing us as an electing body. It worked out rather well though, because by failing to agree on language from the get-go, the Republicans failed to garner even a simple majority (a majority which they have be default in the Senate, mind) and thus Kerry and Edwards were not required to vote for the measure to be defeated. Sure, some Democrat voters have been saying that they wished John/John would man up a little bit, but they were going to vote for him anyways and still will. Their avoidance of the vote was the only politically smart choice, and you people should realize you have a couple of shrewd dealers on your hands.   The importance of this, the signifigance of this public flogging of the Republicans, is that it displays even more weakness in a campaign that's already bleeding out. Bush's policies are apparently so unpalatable he can't get a simple majority for a sponsored measure in a Senate his party controls. Soon they will all be sitting on the curb, shoulders slumped, saying "If only this or this had happened" and thinking that they'll get 'em next year. Like most good ballplayers they won't blame the coach, which is good because every senator that signed his or her name to that resolution is like a pitcher who somehow makes it to the major leagues despite having the idea that their job is to hit batters in the face with fastballs as often as possible. Yes, both this and your actual job involve throwing a ball, but one way is correct and the other way will get you fired, will ruin your stats, and will most likely end up with a clubbing of some sort.

      Remember last month when  urlLink the United States resumed diplomatic relations with Libya?  They promised to dismantle all their WMD programs and stop harboring terrorists, and we said that we would lift sanctions and start making the nice with them again.  In April the sanctions were lifted and on 28 June diplomatic ties were re-established.   urlLink Just 18 days earlier , a story broke concerning Libya's plot to take out Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.  Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns, before deciding to renew the direct diplomatic relationship with Libya, had several meetings with Libya's leaders to investigate the charges of the alledged assassination plot.  The State Department made it very clear that if they actually uncovered such a plan, Libya would be in big trouble.  Apparently everything was kosher (ha ha) because after these meetings the diplomatic decision was made.    So why am I telling you this?  During these meetings,    Burns said the two sides "held detailed discussions on Libya's commitment to support the global war on terrorism, to repudiate the use of violence for political purposes and to implement its pledge to cease all support for terrorism."   Apparently Libya took this directive as an X-Treme World Combatant license, and now are threatening to bomb Chad unless they hand over Ammari Saifi - sporting the flashy alias Abderrezak - who last year lead a group which kidnapped 32 European tourists in Algeria.  Saifi leads the  urlLink Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , who are not only apparently to blame for heisting the tourists but also have links to al-Qaeda.   So, thus far we're dealing with the Libya, Chad, Algeria, and the autonomous European Unit.  This is where it gets fun.  In September 2003, Germany issued an international arrest warrant for Saifi, and the Movement for Democracy and Justice (MDJC) in Chad  urlLink arrested him in accordance to the warrant .   urlLink In 1998 the MDJC began an armed rebellion against the Chad government , and after  urlLink having a look  at a few  urlLink Transparency International  reports and  urlLink related news stories , maybe this wasn't such a bad idea.  The MDJC and the government of Chad signed an official peace agreement in 2001.  The MDJC and Deby not only signed the initial peace agreement in 2001, but have since updated it annually in 2002 and 2003.  In 2003, MDJC's hardline militant leader Yussuf Togoimi was killed and the kinder, gentler Togoi Abbo took over and the new agreement was signed;  this latest agreement also provided for some members of the MDJC to be appointed as ministers of Chad's government, which officially remakes the MDJC central leadership and core as a political party with recognized office holders.  Now, it certainly doesn't help that  urlLink hardliners in the north of Chad refuse to recognize the treaty  and that Togoi Abbo was not literally living in Chad when he negotiated the secret deal but rather in Burkina Fasso, where he'd been since 2000.  So the problem is, the United States is allied with Idriss Deby, Chad's president, and MDJC are seeking his ouster.  They are doing so because every level of Chad's government and public process is corrupt, right down to the dog catchers.   urlLink Not paying attention to history and Chevron's horrific results from a previous attempt at oil extraction , Exxon, Chevron, a Malaysian oil company, the World Bank, and the Deby administration have been working on a new pipeline through Chad and Cameroon for the last four years which was recently finished.  So, the MDJC (who is, if you'll remember, holding a known terrorist with actual ties to al-Qaeda   they arrested   legally on an international arrest warrant issued by Germany) is politically opposed to Idriss Deby, and even lead by an ex-Minister of defense from the Chadian government.  Libya is going to bomb the MDJC or attack them by invasion if they do not surrender this known terrorist that the United States, France, Germany, and Algeria all refused to take.  The MDJC has no means for transporting Saifi to the Western world, and  urlLink the United States refused to aid in the transport of an internationally known, operational terrorist leader with ties to al-Qaeda  despite the fact that the US has a military presence in the area specifically to combat terrorism .    Go back and read that last part again.  I'll wait.  So now you're wondering why in the hell I've given you all this background information about Libya attacking a rebel group with   a disenfranchised political leader  a hardline militant wing of holdouts to the north  a recognized peace accord with the Chadian government  possession of an Algerian terrorist prisoner  and also an oil pipeline running from Chad to Cameroon that is now actively producing millions of barrels of oil.  Well, here's the punchline, so far.  Like most good jokes, its in two parts:   Togoi Abbo, a former Chadian ambassador to Libya, has been resident in Ouagadougou for the past three years. His rebel movement has close links with Libya, which once claimed the Aouzou Strip in northern Chad where the MDJT is active.     urlLink UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs, 14 December 2003      Cameroon and Chad, two of the world's poorest countries, began to sell oil on Friday as the first shipment of 950,000 barrels of crude from their joint pipeline reached the international oil market. The pipeline was developed by an international consortium in which ExxonMobile holds 40 percent of the stakes, Malaysia's Petronas 35 percent and ChevronTexaco 25 percent. The World Bank has invested close to $93 million in the $3.7 billion-project and others including the European Investment Bank and the US Export-Import Bank have invested in it.   urlLink UN Integrated Regional Information Networks, 6 October 2003     I'll give you even money that  urlLink with all of the problems Chad is having with Darfur and Sudan , it won't be long before the new pipeline running through the region becomes a hotly contested military / economic target.  Libya attacks Chad,  urlLink Chad ends up in a two front war with around 60% of its border becoming hostile , Sudanese refugees consume Chad's already tiny amount of resources, Libya invades Chad in earnest, and pretty soon we end up with Chalibya, or Libyad.  Whichever way it goes, it will be the Badass Republic of Oil (BROIL), controlling a much more sizable chunk of the world's oil supply than Libya ever had before.  I'm not saying this is going to happen, but when Libya gains diplomatic and trade relations with the civilized world on promises of non-violence, and then takes up Bush's Flaming Sword and tries to eat Chad, I think the situation and the brazen animals involved bear watching.   Qadhafi is a snapping dog, an actual terrorist leader of not just an actual terrorist group but an  actual terrorist nation  that the Bombs-For-Jesus crowd failed to handle in the 1980's despite a crushing grip on the United States decision-making limbs.  Now, after a quick PR refurbishment, they're in the process of paying $2.7 billion to the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 which they gleefully bombed to confetti in the 80's and are bombing political parties on foreign soil for harboring terrorists.  We'll see, I suppose.  The beasts are dangerous as always, and newly uncaged.

         When I packed my bags for Chicago, there was nothing unusual about including a Bell motorcycle helmet, yellow ski goggles, a new pair of Chuck Taylor All-Stars and a short billy club.  Packing for Chicago was not like taking off for Club Med.   - Hunter S. Thompson,  A Generation Of Swine     What Thompson is talking about here is heading for the Democratic National Convention in 1968.  Hubert Humphrey was beaten by Richard Nixon by around 500,000 votes in the following presidential election, and the rest, as they say, is history.  From that point on, until Clinton appeared and bestowed some deliverance upon the Democrats, they lost 5 out of 6 elections and Carter was more or less a fluke.    Thompson was describing this during a characteristic lament about Dukakis' defeat in 1988 against the first George Bush, who had somehow waded his way through the minefield of the Iran-Contra affair and came out smelling miraculously like roses instead of the slime he had trod through.  Everyone associated with Dutch and the whole late-term mess they put together should probably have been tied up in burlap sacks and shipped to Guatemala, but they weren't.  The reason stands to this day, and I'm not sure I will hear much argument about it: that Dukakis lost the election far more than Bush won it.  By all accounts, the current Bush should have been done by now. It would be much easier on everyone if he just put down the Flaming JudeoSword of Justice and confessed his sins.  But he won't, because we're letting him get away with it.  In 2004 we find ourselves in a similar situation to 1988: Kerry is running even keel with Bush right now on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, and I have no doubt we can expect a temporary surge in poll numbers for our team once the convention is complete.  It is important, however, to remember how many days there are between now and when we will vote and try and save the country from the newly empowered remnants of Reagan's Bombs-And-Jesus crowd.  Many days equals many opportunities to blow it, and the responsibility to avoid political implosion rests upon the whole party, not just Kerry and Edwards.  Bush isn't doing much to  win  the election thus far - being president already helps quite a bit, and I have no doubt that many well-intentioned but uninformed voters will consider the fact that we haven't all been vaporized by the Evil-Doing Brown Men from Farawayistan and vote for Bush because of it.  It is a grand mistake and one borne of ignorance, but it will happen.  This is the caliber of political thought we are dealing with in this country.  I even know a girl I went to high school with who says she's going to vote for Bush strictly because he's from Texas.  It is frightening, yes, but it has been considered before.  Adlai Stevenson was not the only person to say, "In a democracy, people get the kind of government they deserve."  The only problem is, the deserving majority may end up outweighing the people who actually use their brains and see what is happening around them.    Are the transgressions of this Bush worse than those his father and Dutch perpetrated during the Iran-Contra debacle?  You bet your ass they are.  But that isn't the important question, because  most people don't care .  At least it seems that way. I hope people figure out that Bush is starting to talk about what he calls a  urlLink "comprehensive solution to the Cuba problem" and bringing democracy to the down-trodden people of Cuba.   Does that sound familiar?  It should, because he's used this language before in his pep talks about Iraq.    We have a pool going right now on which country we'll invade or go to war with next.  At the moment, the odds-on favorite is Cuba at 4-1, but I've got my money on China.  If Bush manages to bolt himself into the Oval Office for another four terrible years, I expect to see a numbers shake-up and then we'll see a China-Taiwan-US cage match maybe all the way down to 3-1.  He'll have more time to prepare, and  urlLink to catch up with the SEVEN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS  he just sent to the Taiwan Strait, a week after  urlLink China practiced invading Taiwan.   So anyways, here comes the DNC, and I'm still trying to figure out a way to get into it and determine if we, as the collective opposition to Bush 2004, have a plan beyond "Don't screw up."

       INTERNAL MEMO - NOT FOR RELEASE - INTERNAL MEMO 	  From:  Jeff Shipley, Grand Dragon of Marketing/Public Relations To:  Grand Wizard of the KKK, All Grand Dragons of the KKK, Area Recruitment Heads, and Shift Managers   Hey gang-  Jeff Shipley here,  thrilled  to be working with the Ku Klux Klan.  Little background on me:  I’m 31 years old, spent the last three with Pierce & Banner PR after leaving MPACT Marketing.  Married, no kids (unless you count our dachshund Contessa!), and a sweet summer duplex in Portland.  I was hired to help bring the Klan up to date with today’s marketing.  Folks, public opinion is worth a lot.  It can literally make or break you.  Literally.  Historically, the Klan has always been at odds with public opinion.  I’m here to change all that.  I’ve looked at the facts and figures, and talked to a number of you personally, and I think I just might have a plan.  A 4-Point plan to make the KKK bigger and better than ever before!   Point-1:  The Blacks   I know, I know, I just hit you with the big one right off.  Well frankly, I just don’t have time to screw around.  Not if I’m going to get this ship back on track.  I understand several of you have a lot of anger and bitterness towards the increasing number of black celebrities in the world; rap artists, professional athletes, etc.  Yes, more black people enjoy fame and fortune than ever before, but look at the overall picture:  the numbers of black people involved in serious crime has climbed higher than ever, civil rights are constantly being ignored, and discrimination has been holding steady for the past 5 years.  Don’t let a few good apples spoil the bunch.  And another thing:  let’s cut out using the ‘n’ word.  I know how fond of it many of you are, but let’s face it:  due to the acceptance of the word within black culture, they mostly don’t care.  It was high time to let it go, anyway.  I mean, we don’t still ride around on horseback when we burn churches, right?   Point-2:  The Hispanics   The good news is the so-called ‘Latin explosion’ in popular culture never really materialized.  The bad news is that statistics show that by the year 2010, Hispanics will become the majority, surpassing Caucasians.  This means we have to start making more proud white people.  So let’s get started on this as soon as possible.  2010 isn’t that far away, and your retarded cousin isn’t going to get pregnant by herself.   Point-3:  The Gays   Gay culture is constantly making new inroads with mainstream pop culture through television shows, movies and other machinations of the Homosexual-Jewish conspiracy in Hollywood.  Rather than attack, I say we use them to our own advantage.    David Duke was arguably the most visible leader of the Klan, and look at the man!  No wonder he lost the governor’s race in Louisiana!  Duke wants to run for Congress when he’s released from prison later this year, and someone’s obviously set the wayback machine for 1988!  I’ve got a call out to 2 of the 5 ‘Queer Eye for the Straight Guy’ guys, and hopefully (fingers crossed!) we’ll have David ready for his inauguration photos in no time!   Point-4:  The Kids   This is really the backbone of the whole plan.  We need to stop thinking in the now, and think in the  after -now.  Young people are not as in touch with racism as they once were.  Sure,  your  kids know white from wrong, but what about their friends, their schoolmates?  To that end, I give you the official mascot of our new children’s recruitment campaign, Krakker Jack!       Krakker Jack is a sprightly, anthropomorphized butter cracker that helps teach kids all about the KKK with his ‘Krakker Jack Facts’!    A Mexican stole your daddy’s job! Arabs smell! Don’t trust a Jew with your money! Black people have extra muscles in their legs.  That’s why they’re so good at sports!    This, more than any other initiative, must really be a team effort.  Make every Klan function into a family function.  Everyone loves a parade!  Turn rallies into singalongs!  Cross burnings into cookouts!  Nothing says family like the Klan and s’mores!  By all means folks, this is just the beginning.  I’m totally open to any suggestions you might have.  Feel free to give me a call, and I’ll be happy to talk.  Unless I’m not there, then Donna will take a message.    Jeff

       " urlLink ...watching Bush flounder when attempting to communicate extemporaneously, one is left with the impression that he is ineloquent not because he can't speak but because he doesn't bother to think.  "    Oh snap, indeed.  That's an excerpt from the linked story in Esquire entitled "The Case Against George W. Bush".  It is written by Ron Reagan.  While there is obviously a bit of opinion here and there, many facts are presented which have been in the media archives for awhile and plenty of people have compiled.  I just like that Gipper Jr. tossed it all together into a delicious Dissent Salad.  In this time of DNC Hangover, the news comes fast and furious.  Its hard for me to keep up with it all, and the news stories I do find worth mentioning are hardly done any justice by a mere link-and-blurb treatment. However, some things should be mentioned in a quick, non-analysis statement:   urlLink Bid processes are getting by-passed in Iraq, and 67 criminal investigations for fraud are under way.   That means the Coalition's Provisional Authority for rebuilding Iraq is corrupt.  That means people are stealing your money.  YOUR MONEY.   urlLink Zarqawi wasn't actually captured.    urlLink Ralph Nader, getting all kinds of help from the GOP to get on the ballot in swing states gets mad at Kerry for not sending him a fruit basket or something, says "Call off your dogs."    urlLink Don't forget about the record budget deficit posted by the White House.  $445,000,000.00   Especially when you get smoke blown up your asses about how we've "turned a corner."   urlLink Bush wants you to know he has accomplished things, and has achieved legislative and military "results".   How you interpret that is up to you.   urlLink Remember Libya?   T-r-o-u-b-l-e, that starts with T that spells "A plot to assassinate the Saudi Crown Prince." Shhhhh.   urlLink The US Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan was bombed.    urlLink Chinese president Hu Jintao warns President Bush that "China will not tolerate Taiwan's independance",  and strongly advised the United States that it will also not tolerate the sales of weapons and technology to Taiwan.  The White House actually proclaimed that it "reaffirmed [Bush's] backing for the one-China policy - which does not support Taiwanese independence - while reasserting America's commitment to help Taiwan defend itself."  In case you couldn't tell, that's a pretty huge double standard, and one  we may end up going to war with China over .   urlLink Sudan waffles over a UN Resolution that atrocities be stopped within 30 days.   Really, who wants to stop atrocities?  Oh yeah, and  urlLink Iran has started making nuclear weapons components again .  You know what that means!  And finally, finally - two men, registered Democrats, were ordered  urlLink to sign a Pledge Of Support for President Bush before they were given tickets  to attend a speaking event by Vice-President Dick Cheney at a Rio Rancho public school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  They tried to file a court order claiming that the event - held on public property - be open to people of all political affiliaitions, and they were denied.  OMG THE QUARTERBACK IS TOAST AM I RITE.

No actual major news sources are confirming this.  So that means either it didn't really happen, or someone would like this gather steam over the weekend and overtake the news from the White House about the  urlLink record $445,000,000,000 budget deficit .  You see, the White House releases the really bad news on Fridays at the end of the week's news cycle because it dramatically lessens the impact and fewer people care about it because far fewer people pay attention to the regular news on Fridays.  So, to draw attention to it: $445,000,000,000.00  445 billion.  The highest overdraw ever.  If the American taxpayer were a bank (which we are) what would the overdraft fees be like?  I pay $75 if I go over by as much, and it gets exponentially worse from there.  Also, "budget deficit" means "we spent this much more money than we actually had to spend."  And if the Zarqawi thing isn't true, then no one will mind if I point out how  urlLink the Bush Administration passed on definite chances to nail Zarqawi three times after September 11th.      Friday's aren't just  bad  news days, they are  scary  news days.   All around us, its a symphony of news!   urlLink Look Mom, its the Department of Homeland Security!   They are gathering information on where all the A-rabs in America live!  Just in case!  o. m. G.   urlLink Oh, and over there, its the Secret Service!   They are safeguarding against turbans loaded with Uzis!   urlLink Oh, oh, and a Bush Campaign worker says people that don't like their shitty new Bushjobs should take prozac!  Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt, is the most compassionate conservative yet!   urlLink That last story has some impact, since Bush wants everyone in America to be screened for mental illness and the House Appropriations Committee set aside $20,000,000 for it.   You guys chew on that while I go see the Manchurian Candidate.

       urlLink These guys are total morons.   The way this is going to play out is that Boston cops snapped on the last day or something, but let me tell you the truth about it:  Several protester groups planned to cause trouble today.  I heard it from cops, I especially heard it from protestors, I heard it from all kinds of people that today was going to be the day that the protesters got rowdy and caused trouble, and that it was gonna go down at the Fleet Center.  I just wanted to make that clear.   urlLink The Black Tea Society and the Boston Indy Media  are talking about it all here, but just keep in mind that if you plan on getting arrested, you aren't really getting harassed by cops when it happens.

       urlLink These poor bastards.   I'll tell you why it sucks to be a Texas delegate at the DNC - when I was covering happenings outside the Fleet Center and around Boston yesterday, I saw a Texas Delegate buy his own lunch.  If he'd been from North Carolina or Ohio, someone would have been throwing filet mignon at him.  Instead, he walked from the Fleet center to a sub shop and bought his lunch and then ate by himself.  I asked him for a comment.  His face lit up, briefly shining with the idea that someone...  cared  about him.  He didn't have much to say.  No goodies, no love, barely even any attention from anyone at the event.  Mostly they are treated with a sad smile and a shake of the head.  They come from the land of Bush, he says, and it might as well be Mars.  After speaking with him, I walked into the famed Protest Pen, the Cage, and find it almost totally empty.  There are tattered, sodden remains of signs clinging to the fences and tourists walking around taking pictures of them.  They say things like "IS THIS DEMOCRACY?" and "IS THIS THE FREEDOM WE'RE FIGHTING FOR?"  A guy snapping pictures looks up at the razor wire and says "Oh look, its true."  Besides tourists, there are several police officers patrolling the area.  I snag one and ask for a few words, which she says she'll give so long as I don't use her name.  The female police officer tells me that things have been really quiet and that, for the most part, the protesters haven't caused one bit of trouble, and what's more, have been really respectful and nice. However, there haven't hardly been many protesters at all, and they apparently were hearing that Thursday was "Civil Disobedience Day" and that the kids were planning on getting rowdy.  One sign had been removed from a police fence so that the cops could see through it, but that was mostly it for confrontations so far.  The only actual incident had occured on Tuesday when the geniuses from GodHatesFags.com showed up.  They yelled at every delegate, calling them sodomites, and told all the protesters and cops they were going to hell.  My favorite part of this story is how the anti-abortion protestors ended up getting in a major scuffle with the GodHatesFags crew, which resulted in the latter group getting tossed.  "They had little kids with them," the cop tells me, shaking her head.  "I live in Southie and I never seen people as mean as what I saw yesterday.  Are they all in one big family or what?"  I answer her. "It wouldn't surprise me if they're all related, if you catch my meaning.  They all belong to one big church, in Alabama.  Apparently it is the church of God's elect, his special children.  According to them, anyways."  "Easy for them to say." she says.  "Little kids, man."  "They have monuments on their website dedicated to displaying how long victims of hate crimes have been burning in hell.  They have one for Matthew Sheppard, they picket other churches for being Godless whores, and so on and so forth,"  I tell her.    She just sort of stares at me in disbelief.  "That's actually a church?"    We talk about the general consequences of filling little kids up with hate for a while, and then I move on.    As I leave the Protest Pen, a sax player starts ripping into "America The Beautiful."  The cops all smile and clap.  The version is really soulful, and I can't help but grin.  I see a slat-shouldered blonde man waiting by the gate to get in, and I accost him.  He looks like a journalist, and I want to find out what the media accomodations have been like for the little guy. He turns out to not just be a journalist, but from the foreign press, from Finland.    I ask him how covering American politics differs from Scandinavian political journalism, and he laughs, telling me that he's only heard people call it Finlandish or even Dutch journalism.  I apologize on behalf of my geographically challenged countrymen.  He tells me there is much more pageantry and orchestration in this convention than he ever sees at home.  "Of course," he says, "I haven't seen a coronation in a while, either."  Mr. Finland goes on to tell me that they have been provided with excellent work space but that they have the same access problem that always exists for journalists.  He also laments the lack of real news, and seems amazed by the idea that "Shove it" serves as a leading story in this vacuum.  "You know," I say, "'Shove it' would have been news in American politics no matter what, sad as that is."  "Yeah," he says.    I tell him that that if he'd been here in the seventies he could have experienced the McGovern convention, which had quite a bit more action, or God forbid, Chicago in 1968.  I also say that Americans fall asleep when you start talking about substance or policy or what you're actually going to spend their money on, and he laughs.  "Kerry's biggest danger is changing to please anyone at the last minute." Finland opines. "It seems like in American politics, no matter what you do will get you in trouble, so he should just be who he is.  There's less chance of screwing things up that way."  "You are a politically keen observer," I say. "Stay away from my job."  I head into the D'angelos where I saw the poor Texas delegate feeding himself and I get a sandwich.  Two interviews makes it time to eat.  I get about halfway through my sandwich when the first one lands - the pidgeon, I mean.  The dirty flying rats smell my bread from the rooftops, and suddenly I'm surrounded on all sides by the nasty animals, all cooing and waiting for me to show a moment of weakness, during which they will overtake me.  I put my sandwich away and stand up, and as I do, a raucous cheer sounds behind me, up the street.  I turn around and see a man phalanxed by what appear to be adoring hordes.  I gird up my journalistic loins and make a run for it, because I've just realized I'm watching Howard Dean walk up the street.  "Howard Dean!" I holler.  "How will things be on Friday morning?"  Dean looks me right in the eye and says "We're a whole new party, and we're gonna show them what that means."  Then he is borne away by the Deaniacs, looking as if at any moment he will be lifted onto their shoulders, or set into a litter and carried to the City of Gold, or perhaps flown into a hole in Heaven that opens just for him.  After this I interviewed a few volunteers.  They told me their job is to help people have as much fun as possible, to help them have an easy time in the city.  Colleen is a lifelong Boston resident who votes every chance she gets and leads her team of volunteers.  I see Colleen and her team tell people where to go, take pictures for them, give directions on the phone, and generally have a good time hanging out together, being of service.  Colleen smiles easily and wears sandals.  Dana is another volunteer, a 27 year old grad student.  She is all flush with excitement from seeing Dean and seems a bit reluctant to be interviewed, but soon she opens up.  She tells me she would like to one day go into city government, and she loves the idea of government and democracy.  "Hang on," she says after about five minutes of talking. "I have to help these delegates."  Then she is gone into the crowds.  What she said - the "idea" of government and democracy - really hit me as I climbed onto the T and headed for home, to get my ill-fated scoop up on this page.  I can only assume that this idea she talks about is the same one that made me get all teary-eyed when John Edwards spoke.  The idea that things  can  get better is one of the few thoughts I've had lately that is stronger than the knowledge that things are totally cockeyed now.    The idea we've been living with for the last three years is that things are fine, and they are not.  My friends' parents are routinely laid off from jobs they've given 28 and 29 years to, mere months before their retirement benefits would come full.  Now they have nothing.  My parents are some of the hardest working people I have ever known, period, and they usually have to count on luck to get through the month, let alone through to retirement.  The generation that fought the Vietnam war is getting screwed along with the rest of us in cycles so vast it must make them difficult to see.   My mother has a year book from her Senior year in high school, and like most people's yearbooks there are signatures in the front, back, and on photos.  I was thumbing through it when I was about twelve and I saw that at least seven or eight pictures per page had a black  X  in the corner.    I said "Mom, these X's, are these your friends?"  She said "No, Josh, those are the ones that died in Vietnam, or came back ruined."  So there's that to consider, when I look at my generation, and how many of us are in danger or are dying, or have died.  I see my generation slowly waking up and getting more involved, but for the most part they remain untouched, and some are even satisfied, thinking the number of people lost is okay so long as the Evil-Doers get bounced.  So people can't pay their bills or the rent or have health insurance or are dodging RPGs in some Third World Hell Hole, and you want to tell me everything is fine?  The idea of government and democracy has a central theme, I believe, of actually being able to affect change when things go wrong.  I would like to think this idea isn't a lie.  Maybe I've gone from being a liberal centrist to a populist optimist, I don't know.  What I do know is that these next few months are going to be a knockdown dragout bar brawl.   Anyways, enough of that depressing noise.  Here's a picture my friend Lexi made.

      Well this is a first.  A political speech made me cry.  I could have read it beforehand, and I didn't want to. He wasn't as firey as some other cats, but I'll be damned if he isn't at least as charismatic as Clinton.  Also, he is going to tear Cheney a new asshole in the debates.

       Day 1     Jimmy Carter  - It was interesting to hear Jimmy Carter rip into anything, especially at this convention which has more or less been geared towards not ripping, tearing, bashing, or rending.  I hear even some party insiders were surprised at how negative he went.  I'm not really sure I care, because I love Jimmy Carter.  His speech was pretty good but his delivery was hampered by old.   Grade: B      Hillary Clinton  - Sweety, we know you didn't get to give as much of a speech as you would have liked.  Yes, it was potentially a disaster for the Party that they went to at least some trouble to rectify.  You make it worse when you joke about it.  The ten seconds you used for your "practically speechless" line could have been better used, and instead you reminded us of something negative.   Grade: D      Bill Clinton  - I don't what else can be said about this cat.  He effectively disarmed the GOP's ability to respond to his crushing criticisms of their economic policy by including himself as a rich guy that benefitted from it.  The only possible downfall to this is a GOP ad asking why he didn't just give his extra money to the government, but that would be foolish and ill-advised. Attacking a rock star always is.  Grade: A      Terry McAuliffe  - I actually witnessed this: Terry's aide: "Don't yell, watch your voice, okay?" Terry: "Sure thing." (Terry goes out on stage) Terry: (immediately starts yelling)  Aside from his voice sounding a little rough, Terry has done better than some of the featured speakers as far as actual public speaking goes.   Grade: B+      Al Gore  - I wanted more screaming, didn't you?  The parts where he chuckled it up were cute and everything, but I really wish he'd had more sack in 2000, so we  could  be re-electing his silly ass.  I   Grade: B      DNC Credentialed Bloggers  - Most of the blogs eat it.  Let's be honest.  I've read some really poor writing about nothing, some decent writing about nothing, some poor writing about something, but only a few blogs have consistently good writing about consistently interesting things.  I don't want to hate on anyone (as I am, after all, a professional), so I'm just gonna link to the good ones:   urlLink Daniel Rubin   urlLink Centrist Coalition   urlLink Opinions You Should Have   urlLink National Journal   urlLink Dave Pell         urlLink Mathew Gross    General DNC Blogger Coverage Grade: C+      Day 2      Benjamin McKenzie  - Hey look, its the kid from the OC - a show all of the smart people I know watch for no obvious reason!  I can't argue with his message, in that he wants young people to vote.  His jokes about Bush were also not bad.  I will not show him the rough side of my tongue because of his show's vapidity. For an actor with no previous political stumping he seemed to do pretty okay.   Grade: C+      Performance by Peter, Paul and Mary: "Blowin'In The Wind"  - What the shit is this?  DNC, you couldn't dig up Joan Baez or Bob Dylan?  Dylan will take money for anything nowadays - didn't you see his Victoria's Secret Model Hostage TV spot?  They look like they broke out of the home and got busker's licenses.   Grade: D-      Tom Daschle  - I've joked about Tom Daschle being unexciting before.  I may have even called him "Snoozefest McGhee".  Last night, his oration literally knocked my ass out for an hour.  He instigated a nap  so powerful  that despite my having the TV up really loud, I slept right through Dean and some of Obama.  Imagine how upset I was.  Damn you, Tom Daschle, and your Vocal Sleep Rays.   Grade: D      Dick Gephardt  - I had a friend within the Gephardt campaign, and she affectionately calls him "Geppie".  I've always liked Gephardt, even way back in '88 I liked him, and I was only 9. He's a good politician with good ideas, and his speech was, I thought, really good.  Too bad none of the unappreciative bastards in the hall realized that they were in the midst of the Really Good.  Good speech, poor control of the crowd.  Tie goes to the runner.   Grade: B      Howard Dean  - I love Howard Dean.  I think he's a badass, and among the superstars in the Democratic galaxy, he's one of the biggest.  His speech was decent but it was sort of uncharacteristcally fluffy.  Of note concerning the language of his speech: the antecedents and consequents in Dean's language were mostly personal - I, me, my, etc. This in balance against the much smaller amount of inclusive language (we, us) should be noted as good politics. Some people will tell you this is Dean pushing his own agenda, but they are wrong - his speech needed to be mildly exclusive in its language so the Deaniacs could feel as if they were finally being folded into the rest of the Democratic party they did so much to energize.  Dean scores with smart politics, and the Music Supervisor of the DNC wins the Semiotics Sign / Signifier Pair Award for Dean's exit music: "We Are Family".   Grade: A      Ted Kennedy  - How can you not get excited about Theodore delivering a speech to his hometown crowd?  You could remember 1988, I suppose.  A lot of us young Democrats ask the old Democrats "Hey, why hasn't Ted ever become President?" and the old Democrats just look sad.  He was the Senator who would be king, but instead he's become a venerable institution in the Senate and its a better legislative body because of him.  His speech, however, didn't really juice my stones.  It could have been his delivery or his cracking voice, I'm not sure.  It could have been the speakers he's competing with, but who cares?  He's Teddy Kennedy and he kicks ass.  I'm still docking his grade though.  Grade: C+      Ron Reagan  - Dear Ron, get off your ass and help us.  You will make an awesome Democrat.  You will be our secret weapon against the remnants of your father's administration.  The Bombs-N-Jesus Crowd will weep as you claim your place among us.  It'll be just like a kung-fu movie, where Rumsfeld was your father's student, and now his master is gone but the prodigal son returns to do battle...   ...ON A FIERY ROOFTOP    Do it.  Do it, damn you.  Grade: A      Teresa Heinz Kerry  - I get it, you're smart.  Stop gibbering at me in foreigner!  On a more serious note, I kind of like her.  I admit, its based entirely on "Shove it", and even more on her reticent refusal to apologize for it.  To know that she was interested in civil and human rights  before  she became mind-warpingly rich also helps my opinion of her.  She should have talked on Monday though, or tonight. Her speech was just a little too calm to be where it was in the line-up.  Grade: B+      Barack Obama  - Are you there God?  Its us, the Democratic Party.  After years of brutal punishment and the inability to organize ourselves you blessed us with a firebrand like Howard Dean, a reincarnation of Clinton in John Edwards, someone actually electable in John Kerry, a progressive voice in Kucinich, an excellent party leader and brilliant strategist in Terry McAuliffe, a Republican that's on our side in Wes Clark and a rallying point in George Bush.  We don't know what we did to deserve these blessings, Lord, and certainly we don't what we did to deserve Barack Obama, the Home Run Holy Hand Grenade of blessings, but thanks.  We'll try not to pooch the deal in the next 12 years or so.  Signed,  The Democratic Party  Grade: A+

      An anonymous source in the Boston Police Department told me just minutes ago that a warehouse has been discovered in Cambridge, MA full to the ceilings with containers full of feces, urine, and blood.  It is not confirmed yet, but according to my source, authorities believe that this warehouse was being rented by or belonged to an activist group operating out of Boston.  I am currently attempting to get confirmation from Boston PD Media Relations.  More on this story will follow.     UPDATE (5:00 PM): Cambridge PD media relations offered this comment: "We haven't heard anything about it."   UPDATE (7:30 PM): Boston PD Media Relations says: "We haven't heard anything about this, and we don't think its true.  Its not true."  So, apparently, there is no truth to the above story.  The Boston PD officer I spoke seems to have been misinformed, or it was a rumor with legs.  There goes my damn scoop.

        "The attendees were generally very happy with the celebrities and elected officials that appeared. There's no question that the extensive 6-hour free program presented by DemocraticGain and RockTheVote which included the likes of Biz Markee and Laryn Hill was enjoyed by all.  It is unfortunate that scheduling conflicts did not allow the Clintons to attend, but there were several opportunities to hear from elected officials and this week should provide the public with many opportunities to see the Clintons and other members of the Democratic party and hear them speak."  - Josh Grossfeld,  urlLink DemocraticGAIN    Once Biz Markie was done with us, the entertainment for the evening slowed down quite a bit.  Diana and I decided to try and see where our bracelets would get us, and that turned out to be "everywhere" for at least a while.  The only downside was that nowhere was really as cool as the VIP room up the stairs, and no one was really hanging out in there.    We were on our way down to the dance floor and a young female Democrat grabbed my wife's ass as she passed by, which was excellent on several levels, especially since she had assured me that I would be the one getting hit on that night.    The natives were already getting restless and it was barely midnight; half-hearted chants of "We Want Bill" would start and die on the floor like some pathetic engine.  Diana commented on the fact they seemed to be unable to commit to their raucous drunken chant and I agreed.  Bill had not shown up yet and the joy in Mudville was starting to look endangered.  There were some more DJs, and then this other band took about an hour and a half to set up.  The word in the crowd was that this was Lauryn Hill's band, and that they would be accompanying Bill as he melted our faces off with a kick ass sax solo.  I had my own doubts about Bill showing up, since I had learned the disparity between the star Democrats' schedules had been causing no small amount of irritation and inconvenience all night.  I did not spread this around because I am a professional.  "Oh, he's definitely coming."  I said to the Young Democrat student representatives from BC and other assorted colleges.  "To doubt that Bill will show up would be to doubt the veracity of the party! Besides, they've closed off the VIP area now, because Bill is on his way."  This was half true.  Security had apologetically not allowed me back upstairs to the drink-bins and easy bathrooms because of a fervent security event.    "Bill is coming!  He's coming!" said one security detail member.  "Tra la!" he added.  "The Rolling Stones are here!" said another.  This latter turned out to be true, as far as I know - but they never came downstairs.   So at this point (around 1:20 am) I'm fully drunk and beginning to wonder where all the celebrities are.  I'm also beginning to wonder why all of the DemoKids are getting so pissed off about the fact that Bill Clinton hasn't shown up yet, and probably won't.    "Fuck this!" shouted one guy, wearing a Fleet Center pass.  "At least I'll get another tax cut in 2005!"    "Whoa, cowboy!" I said.  "You're on the team here.  You guys are trying to save the country.  Are you really going to give up just because Bill's a little busy during the Democratic National Convention?  I mean, shouldn't he be?"  "Who the hell are you?" he asked.  "Josh Berthume, from DamnTheMan.net.  Can I get a quote on how you're quitting the job and why?"  He vacated the area.  This is another important lesson I learned.  Once you get a few drinks in a politico, they'll talk about anything you want to talk about and usually get pretty spirited, especially if it deals with public policy; the more drunk they are, the more severe and sweeping their judgments become.  But the second you say you are  with  someone, even if it is a nebulous publication / website they've never heard of, they immediately cover the Name portion of their badge, lose all the color in their face, and run away like you just attempted to shiv them.  At any rate, the mood was uneven.  The kids were happy and enjoyed the party and there was some general disappointment about Bill not showing up but that seemed to pass for most people.  Not all, but most. The "most" category seemed to include all of the actual Convention attendees and workers.  The people who seemed the most upset were the volunteers and the students - I'm not privy to all the work they've been putting in for the last few weeks, but I think this ultra-exclusive event and its star guests were a reward, after a fashion, and it didn't turn out exactly the way it was promised.  1:45 am rolls around and there is finally motion on the stage - Lauryn Hill's band has been playing for about 20 minutes and she joins them on stage with a quarter of an hour to go. She sings one song, which is all she has time for, and then the party is over.  The older crowd filters out almost immediately, talking amongst themselves and looking as if they have had a really excellent time.  They are, for the most part, not surprised that the Clintons did not show up.    I'm not surprised either, frankly.  In a wide, wide Democratic field of superstars, Bill Clinton is the equivalent of the Beatles, Elvis, and Christ all rolled into one man.  Anyone who watched his speech on Monday night will agree with me wholeheartedly.  If you don't believe me, watch some of the coverage and see if you can spot the men and women among the Delegates  OPENLY WEEPING .  Clinton is a reliquary and within him lies the great and terrible knowledge of how things were before everything got so strange and demented in Washington in the hands of the wrong people.  If Roosevelt got four terms, Clinton could crown himself Glorious General For Life and no one at the Fleet Center Monday night would have thought twice about it, save for Hillary.  This means that Bill is busy.  Gore separated himself from Clinton in 2000 and that was a mistake.  It isn't his fault: politically, it really seemed like the only viable option and I'm sure he had his cadre of 24-35 year olds telling him to stay away.  But the Democratic party was different then, for some reason still carrying the shame of the Eighties around their necks like an albatross and for some reason still gunshy against any sort of character indictment from the GOP, as if they carried scepters imbued with Reagan's essence and he watched from Santa Barbara like an angry, judgmental God, ready to impugn his will upon the Democrats for any sort of transgression.    Today things are different.  When Terry McAuliffe met me, I told him I was a big fan of his work.  He said "Well thanks, it's a whole new Party," and this is more true than most people realize.  Not only does the Democratic Party have a depth uncharacteristic for American politics in general, we have a sense of unity now not unlike the one the Republicans have browbeaten us with for two generations.  Theirs comes from a smug moralistic self-righteousness that they wear with pride like a cheap suit on Prom Night.  Ours comes from the overarching feeling we have of being backed into a corner in a life-or-death situation.  It is unfortunate that unity had to come in such a package for either side, but this is how it is.  So Bill is busy, because he's stumping for Kerry, and the whole party is finally and for once unified behind an idea, the idea of fixing things.  Bill is busy appearing at events geared both to the Democrats and the general public, because every time Bill shows up anywhere he gets at least 10 votes for the Democrats we wouldn't have gotten without him making the appearance, and probably more.  Bill is busy because the Democrats have deployed him like some sort of Charisma-Delivery Missile System because they failed to utilize him in 2000 and they don't want to fuck up like that again. It is possible Bill was too busy to show up at Avalon because the Party needed him somewhere else more than they needed him to preach to the converted  So some college kids missed their chance to see Clinton up close and personal, and a few kids I talked to were upset.  Heather, from Boston College, told me that Bill is her idol and she'd been racing from event to event all day to just try and get a look at him.  But none of them seemed totally disappointed with the Avalon party in general, which was pretty hot.  Everyone seemed energized by the speakers and ready to kick ass and take names for the next three months.    As Diana and I were leaving we ended up in some totally bizarre debate with a Libertarian, one of those "Backbone" guys, and a guy from North Carolina who talked with a Brooklyn accent and was apparently a Neanderthal Republican.  This latter GOP rep called my wife a Dixie Chick for being from Texas and she was very sensibly offended.  Seeing that our previous residence would do nothing to help our argument that this isn't the year to try and turn our political party system into France's, I hailed a cab.    P.S. Robert Smigel and Triumph were outside, having apparently been barred from entering the party.  The publisher of Spin Magazine was also there.  I introduced myself to him as the editor of damntheman.net, and he said "Great" and turned towards Smigel, trying to get his attention.  After figuring out it was more or less a recruiting pitch to appear at events in New York for Spin, Smigel and Triumph turned to me. "Who are you weeth?  Damn de Man?" Triumph asked.  The guy from Spin looked defeated and walked away.  Smigel had never heard of us and he isn't a reader, but he did give me this quote:   Man, I would love to hump Hillary's legs.   - Triumph The Insult Comic Dog, 25 July 2004

      Tonight I saw a side of politics that most people don't get to see.  I met a large and varied cast of characters, talked to many Democrats young and old, and learned a thing or two about dedicated political participants in the process.  Diana and I arrived at the Kenmore Square T-stop at 9:40.  The party had begun at 9:00.  Since it had been described to me by my contact as a fairly exclusive affair, I figured showing up fashionably late would make it seem as if I wasn't out of my depth.  I was wrong, because as we turned down Lansdowne Street from Comm Ave I saw a teeming mass of people.  Of note (and eventual importance) is how diverse this giant crowd was - a protester on a bicycle with a barely legible hand-written sign stood and screamed at a stand-up for CNN;  urlLink LaRouche Democrats  hollered snide remarks at DNC staffers manning the doors while Biz Markie stood next to me under the canopy and waited to catch the attention of the security detail.  The Biz and I had a conversation, and it went like this:  Me: Sup Biz? Biz: Sup foo. Me: You kick the jamz that I need pretty hard. Biz: Word.  Diana waited for me at the end of the block-long line while I approached the doors and did a little name dropping.  I mentioned that my contact had put me on "the list" to a harried-looking but friendly staffer at Avalon's main entrance and she said "Let me find out something for you." and then disappeared.  I felt as if the whole thing could go awry very quickly and assumed I'd never see her again, but she came back and told me that the person with the VIP / DNC list had disappeared and she couldn't help me.    Apparently there were several lists and it was hard to keep track of them all.  For instance, a girl next to me was with  urlLink RockTheVote  and said she was on  some other  list, the specific "Rock The Vote" list.  The staffer looks at her with mild exasperation and says "You aren't the only one having this problem - RockTheVote got 500 tickets and they invited 1000 people, telling them all they were on "the list".  So "the list" is a genuinely dangerous thing, able to mutate and grow beyond the control of its creators, like Jurassic Park or Justin Timberlake.  About that time my cell phone rang and Diana told me that my contact was coming in and that I might try and get her attention before she disappeared inside.  Important Lesson #1 - if your name is on "the list", you must assume that everyone's name is on "the list" (see mutation clause above) and make sure you have someone on the other side of the rope to point at you and say "He's with me."  If my contact hadn't been there to grab us and pull us inside, I seriously doubt we would have ever gotten in, despite the apparently all-powerful wristbands which we'd been given.  The wristbands only bought us a place in a rather long line behind a Congressman, staffers beyond number, and the Chairman of a Latino Democrat association - it was only the personal touch that got us through the door in a reasonable amount of time.   The wristbands were really the key to the whole evening.  Garnishing stares of naked envy from the surrounding people, we were lead upstairs to the VIP area and away from the hollering multitudes on the dancefloor. Every area except the general common area was restricted to a certain color of wristband, but my contact had delivered unto us the unholy Black Wristband, which creates and destroys all other wristbands with its great and terrible power. As we went upstairs, Natalie Portman passed on her way down.  I wouldn't have known this if Diana hadn't told me later, so in hindsight I'm really glad I didn't trip and send Amidala careening down a narrow stairwell and into history.  Once upstairs, I had some time to talk to my contact, which was nice.  We're old friends and we had been originally planning on dinner and drinks; this would have been better in some ways because we would have had more time to catch up, but then I probably wouldn't have gotten to see Al Sharpton do the Ed Lover dance, which I'll explain in a minute.  Once we'd had a few minutes to talk, we were introduced to Terry McAuliffe, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  Terry's a nice guy, and the more we talked the more he seemed like a regular personable guy, as well.  He was funny, laughed easily, and when Diana or I were speaking it seemed as if he was really listening to us as opposed to waiting for his turn to talk.  My gut tells me he's the real thing, and my gut is rarely wrong.  Next, its Terry's time to fire up the crowd, so we all head back downstairs. By some sort of sideways blessing, we end up  on stage  as Terry is giving his speech; not as if we were his posse, mind you, but just off stage-left a bit, behind some speaker stacks.  Seeing McAuliffe amp up the troops for the coming week and 99 days was pretty exciting, even though I am not strictly a card-carrying Democrat.  I recognize that speeches like his and the one Sharpton gave later on are designed to get my nads all randy for political battles, but it is easy to forget the difference between seeing something like that on TV and witnessing it in person.  I felt proud to be there and proud to be a part of it.  And then, of course, Biz Markie spun up every 70's TV theme you can think of and made people sing along to them or else he would "show them what's proper", which is probably within the Biz's jurisdiction.  During Biz's set, someone from off-stage kept trying to talk to him.  It wasn't us - by this time Diana and I had repaired to the bar - and despite seeming a bit annoyed Biz handled it well.  He would put on a different record, bust a few scratches, get the crowd going, and then clearly say something "WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT" to whoever was talking to him.  Its a good thing he was able to find out, because Al Sharpton was there and gave the crowd a talk which kicked a metric ton of ass.  It was able to kick this much ass because its argument centered around James Brown's 1968 release  The Big Payback  and how it applied to what the Democrats and the voters were going to give the GOP in November.  Biz had this record in his collection, and soon Al Sharpton and Biz Markie were busting moves flavored with Act-Rite.  Once the good Reverend started to wind down the shaking of his groove thing, Diana and I made for the VIP room again hoping to catch Sharpton in a mood which would be condusive to discussing James Brown's many talents.  It was not to be, as Al bolted for the door and likely another event.  Biz told us we needed "John Kerry up in this motherfucker" and then he had to bounce as well.  Stay tuned later today for Part 2 (Editorially truncated for length and sleep commands)

      Thanks to an old pal of mine, my wife and I are going to the  urlLink DNC Rock The Vote  party tonight at  urlLink Avalon in Boston .  There are going to be all kinds of fun people there; I've heard anyone from Affleck to Bill Clinton could show up.  On the definites list are my old (and stringently anonymous) friend and  urlLink Terry McAuliffe, Chairman of the DNC .  The question remains - what do I talk to them about if I get the chance to meet them?  I'm going to do my best stay cool and just enjoy the show, and I promise either periodic audio updates or one super-report when I get back.  Also, I've submitted DamnTheMan to  urlLink Kicking Ass , the Democratic National Committee blogwatch.  We'll see if they like us enough to include us in the proceedings over there.  Finally, I've decided to lighten up on the bill listings and geopolitical / international affairs analysis until after the convention;  we have before us one of the last remaining remnants of old-time participatory politics, and at least until they're done with Boston I'm going to focus on what's happening here.  They were nice enough to come to me, and we should remember that before anything else, we are professionals.

       urlLink Rick James is dead.   I can't believe that Blogger has been breaking on me every time I've tried to update all week, and the time it works is when I screw around and click the B on the "Rick James is dead" story.  If this actually posts maybe I can upload some of this week's update retro-style.  If not, I swear things will get back to normal as soon as Blogger quits freaking out.

      Last week was difficult.  The candidates and the world in general seemed reticent and hard to get a handle on.  Many things happened and reporting them from the icy backward steppes of bad wiring and orange late-summer skies proved difficult.  How grateful we all are, then, for another week.  If you will remember from several weeks ago, the  urlLink Republicans  scrounged in the absence of Jack Ryan and falsely delivered Mike Ditka for the vacant Illinois Senate seat.  For those of you who don't watch the news or pay attention to the world around, the previous sentence is not a joke: the best idea the Illinois Republicans could come up with as a collective political think tank was running a former (yet beloved) NFL Coach, Mike Ditka.  He decided not to run and so his wife isn't divorcing him, although luck, faith and hope seem to have abandoned the GOP in the Land of Lincoln:   urlLink Keyes to Challenge Obama for U.S. Senate Seat   That's right.  Somehow, by using an actual politician, they  worsened  their chances.  Lincoln would have problems against Obama, unless it comes out that he eats infants or something.   And I'm pretty sure he doesn't.   The Republicans are actually going to spend money on this race, and more power to them.  Although eventually Keyes is going to get tired of being the official Sacrificial Lamb for black conservatism and roll up on some fools.   Item : During the last State of the Union address,  urlLink Bush told us that "Americans are safer" and that the world is "taking a turn for the better" .  You might also remember the whole "Americans are safer" thing being a big talking point pre-DNC.  Well, all we've heard ever since the end of The Great Hope Hype has been about  urlLink how we are not safe at all.   I understand that certain things must be said in the service of politics, I get that.  But I really wish he would only try to sell me on one thing or the other, not both.  It is continually this strange dichotomy of the Armageddon Dutch expected and new sunshiney morning he foretold.  But it is important to remember that we are in danger, so we won't focus on the fact that the jobs market is in the dumper. Words have been tossed around in this forum like "unemployment" and "jobs record", and in some cases I have been remiss.  In some instances when I have said "unemployment" I've actually meant  urlLink "underemployment".    Sure, some jobs have been created and what we've been told hasn't entirely been a lie, but more a lie by omission.   urlLink So last week's news that the jobs market sucks was not a huge surprise to me, but to some people I imagine it was.   In Canadian news,  urlLink God has beset the Great White North with a plague , yea, and all shall perish and the trees shall burst from their untapped maple syrup.   urlLink And West Africa too.  But without the syrup.   In conclusion, Iran is not only making nuclear weapons again but is also  urlLink sending weapons to insurgents in Iraq.   I'm not going to say that this is a possibility but just brazenly claim it is actually happening, because why wouldn't it?  Also,  urlLink this is one of the most bizarre things I've ever read .  Its about the Bushes going to church.
