      Just got back from my second day of running?  Tammy almost passed out when I left her a note yesterday that I was going for a run.   I have always had trouble and  just plain lazy when it came to running. But, now I feel that I would like to try it ............we will see how many days I actually make in a row.  So far 2!   Mark.

      This is the first day of summer for me.  I have just got out of school yesterday. Summer for me starts when school gets out. I have 71 days off (yee ha!)  Who knows what I will be doing this summer but I hope to get in some golfing and sailing.  I went to the Store today (WalMart). Saw one of the little ones I used to teach....just the one I didnt want to see of course.  I picked up some envelopes and hope to get out some DVDs of our wedding to friends that couldnt make it....of course i'm only 1 year late.  Worked on the webite  Magicfx  today.  It seems to be coming along better than expected. I usually always start making sites and then never finish them. But, I have high hopes for this one.  I feel it has potential and will finally carry some content.  WOW!  I just completed my first ever  BLOG!

      just happened to come across a site.  faces.com might be a great place for magicians to go and exchange ideas and thoughts.  Get a group of people that like casinos, magic, cards, and put them together on faces.com  What a great way to network.  Just an idea for the future.

      Well,  I'm back after a long time absent. But, I must say that this site has really helped me out in many ways.  First of all, I found squarespace through this site (blogger).  Wow, what a program! I finally found a program that looks good, is easy to use, sets up nice, looks nice, and just damn well done. Nice job!  Secondly, this squarespace.com site lets you focus on content.  And before I was spending all my time on design. Not on content.  And, because im picky and want things to look nice. I never had a site get off the ground.  Well, It finally happend.  Im working on the magic fx ezine site,  in additon, i put up a site for the american museum of magic.  I also worked on a Vegas page with casinos, gambling, specials, and magicians.    Also, i started a basic page on the movie "SHADE".  Which is a great movie staring sylvetor stallone.  So, as you can see, I have been busy with my combined interests of magic, casinos, and the web/design.  Finally, some things are starting to come together.  Mark.
