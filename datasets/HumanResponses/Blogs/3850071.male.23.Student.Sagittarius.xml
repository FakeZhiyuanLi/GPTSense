         To a Butterfly (1801) By William Wordsworth            I've watched you now a full half-hour;           Self-poised upon that yellow flower           And, little Butterfly! indeed           I know not if you sleep or feed.           How motionless!--not frozen seas           More motionless! and then           What joy awaits you, when the breeze           Hath found you out among the trees,           And calls you forth again!            This plot of orchard-ground is ours;           My trees they are, my Sister's flowers;           Here rest your wings when they are weary;           Here lodge as in a sanctuary!           Come often to us, fear no wrong;           Sit near us on the bough!           We'll talk of sunshine and of song,           And summer days, when we were young;           Sweet childish days, that were as long           As twenty days are now.

         From an  urlLink Al-Jazeera   urlLink article :   The Gulf kingdom announced last October it would hold municipal elections, the first in four decades, after pressure from the US and domestic reformers to grant some political participation and freedom of expression.   [...]  The US is eager to promote reform in the Middle East and has encouraged its long-standing ally, the world's biggest oil producer, to speed up change since the 11 September 2001 incident.  From a Canadian  urlLink National Post   urlLink article :  Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the kingdom's de facto leader, ordered authorities to prepare for municipal elections within a year. His announcement came a few months after suicide bombings in Riyadh on residential compounds housing foreigners in May 2003 brought terrorism home to the kingdom, long accused by the West of not doing enough to stamp out international terrorism.   The Riyadh bombings generated a new sense of urgency in a Saudi reform drive that began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. Fifteen of the 19 suicide hijackers were Saudi, prompting questions about whether the conservative form of Islam practised in the kingdom feeds extremism.   Now, my question is would any of this have happened had we not invaded Iraq?

      Frederick Winsor was the headmaster of the  urlLink Middlesex School . In his last address to the school, which was given in 1938, in the wake of the Depression and in the face of rising fascism, he said the following to his students (my question is why the hell didn't my principal sound like this?):  Life is full of things worth fighting for, and I ask you to save your strength for these vital things to which all of us owe "the last full measure of devotion." Compromise with your adversary while you are in the way with him about anything and everything you like except matters of principle. Justice, freedom, truth; these are matters more important by far than your life or mine. Out of this town in which we live, out of the same air we breathe every day, came the inspiration behind Emerson’s immortal lines:  Though love repine, and reason chafe, There came a voice without reply,-- "’T is man’s perdition to be safe When for the Truth he ought to die!"  You should court danger, you should demand freedom, and you should ask for nothing but opportunity. When the men in this region were risking their lives for freedom and standing up against trained soldiers down by the Concord River, Longfellow tells us they came from "every Middlesex village and farm." This School borrowed its name from the county which produced those men. It would be unworthy to bear it if it did not dare to teach you to risk all that you have or hope for to preserve the love of freedom in this, our country. That love of freedom is not merely a political catch-word; it comprises in itself the vital principle on which depends man’s future progress; and combined with justice, it points the road along which that progress lies."  Winsor was an alumnus of the  urlLink Roxbury School , whence comes the above excerpt; the full article about Winsor is available  urlLink here . The  urlLink quoted poem  is one of my favorites.

      I have recently discovered an amazing and legal music download service called  urlLink ALLOFMP3 . It's run by a Russian company and is fully legal in Russia (but the site is in English; don't worry). Though I'm not a lawyer, it seems to me that it's also legal for us to use it, just as it would be legal for us to buy American music CDs from Russian companies (which sell them legally for about $3, which makes sense, given the lower salaries in Russia).  Now, why is this so much cooler than everything else? First, it costs  10-20 times  less than iTunes or Napster--about  5-10 cents per song , depending on its size and other options you select. Second--and this is truly amazing--you can download your songs in whatever format you want, including MP3, Windows Media Audio, OGG Vorbis, MPEG-4 AAC, and MusePack MPC. What does this mean? It means that this service is compatible with  every  software and hardware player in existence, including the iPod (which thus far was only serviceable by iTunes). Third, advanced users can select the quality of the file; the options vary by format, but, for example, for MP3 you can choose the bitrate (from 128 to 384 kbps; cbr and vbr) and encoding codec (LAME or Blade). If you're a true audiophile, you won't be disappointed, as they also allow downloading the songs in lossless formats (Monkey's Audio, FLAC, and OptimFrog). For more information about audio formats, you can read the help section of ALLOFMP3's web site  urlLink here .  The bottom line is that it's much cheaper than everything else in existence, and advanced users can fiddle with the details (though by default all the screens are in basic mode, making it easy for regular users to get started).

      In today's NYT an article pokes fun of Microsoft's attempt at competing with Google. Exerpts:  IT must be fun to walk through the Microsoft parking lot, reading the bumper stickers on the cars. Can you imagine what they must say? "Honk if you love monopolies." "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean we're not out to get you." "My other car is a Hummer, too."  [...]  The Googlification of MSN will occur in two phases. The first, a cosmetic makeover, is now complete and ready for your inspection at www.search.msn.com. The new look consists of an empty white screen that loads blissfully quickly, even over dial-up connections, and an empty, neatly centered text box where you're supposed to type in what you're looking for. The search page is ad-free and, except for the MSN logo, even devoid of graphics. (On July 4, however, MSN added a waving-flag graphic, an imitation of the way Google's witty artists dress up its own logo on holidays.) In short, MSN Search couldn't look more like Google if you photocopied it.  [...]  MSN still displays ads, of course, but they're off to the right side or up above the results list, clearly labeled "Sponsored Sites" and inside shaded boxes - exactly like Google's.   Unfortunately, Microsoft calls the separation of advertising an experiment, not a permanent change in policy. It seems to be trying on honesty in the mirror to see if people will find it attractive, rather than realizing that running a principled business is the way to win customers' trust. In short, "MSN will continue to evaluate the potential of paid inclusion to improve relevancy."  (Let's hope that MSN will also continue to evaluate the English language, which also includes the perfectly good, much less annoying noun "relevance.")  [...]  First, the tech preview is very, very slow. Second, it should be more discerning; if you search for "motorized draperies," 13 of the first 15 results all come from the same company's Web site. Third, kill the sense of humor: the first result in a search for "1963 Oscar winners" is "1998 Oscar winners." (The actual 1963 winners don't even appear on the first page of 15 links.)   [...]  Even so, Microsoft has done a beautiful job de-gunking its home page and removing paid ads from your search results. Will its new search technology attain anything even close to Google's "relevancy?" It's too soon to tell. But if it's successful, Microsoft will have demonstrated its brilliancy, boosted its own importancy and taken another irreversible step toward world dominancy.

       Next time you're talking to a Frenchman, consider using the following dialogue:   You : "Why are the French the tallest army in the world?"  Frenchman : "Why?"  You : Raise your arms in surrender. While the Frenchman is laughing, hide in the bushes.  On June 15, 1940,  urlLink Philippe Pétain , representing the French government, capitulated to the advancing Nazi forces.  urlLink Charles de Gaulle , on the other hand, refused to surrender and fled to England two days later to support an uprising from abroad.  On June 22, 1940, just a few days later, he broadcast a speech via the BBC over France, encouraging the French to persevere. Here is an excerpt, first in French:   On peut donc dire que cet armistice serait, non seulement une capitulation, mais encore un asservissement.   Or, beaucoup de Français n'acceptent pas la capitulation ni la servitude, pour des raisons qui s'appellent l'honneur, le bons sens, l'intérêt supérieur de la Patrie.   [...]  Je dis l'intérêt supérieur de la Patrie ! Car cette guerre n'est pas une guerre franco-allemande qu'une bataille puisse décider. Cette guerre est une guerre mondiale. Nul ne peut prévoir si les peuples qui sont neutres aujourd'hui le resteront demain, ni si les alliés de l'Allemagne resteront toujours ses alliés. Si les forces de la liberté triomphaient finalement de celles de la servitude, quel serait le destin d'une France qui se serait soumise à l'ennemi ?   In English, it is  It may therefore be said that this armistice would not only be a capitulation, but that it would also reduce the country to slavery.  Now, a great many Frenchmen refuse to accept either capitulation or slavery, for reasons which are called : honour, common sense, and the higher interests of the country.  [...]  I say the higher interests of the country, for this is not a Franco-German war to be decided by a single battle. This is a world war. No one can foresee whether the neutral countries of to-day will not be at war tomorrow, or whether Germany's allies will always remain her allies. If the powers of freedom ultimately triumph over those of servitude, what will be the fate of a France which has submitted to the enemy ?  Luckily, the speech was recorded, and you can listen to it  urlLink here . Also, you can see the whole speech in  urlLink English  and in  urlLink French .  If you know even a little bit of French, I encourage you to listen to the audio file and read along either in English or in French (he speaks slowly, so it'll work). Charles de Gaulle's yearning for freedom and unwillingness to submit to servitude is extraordinary, and you will hear it in his voice.

      There is an  urlLink article  in today's NYT that I have been anticipating for some years. Europe is finally admitting that their spread-the-word schemes are stupid. They thought, naively, as follows: there is high unemployment, so if we put a low ceiling on the number of hours a person can work, companies will be forced to hire more workers, thus reducing unemployment. Of course, this is a classic case of the phenomena described in   urlLink Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas   ( urlLink here  in English), which is a classic essay by the 19th century French economist  urlLink Frédéric Bastiat  about the hidden effects of various economic policies. In this case, the naive thought was correct,  for the short term . However, in the long term, since the firms are not allowed to do what they want (i.e., to hire workers for long hours), and since firms want to do what makes them the most profit, the European firms made a lower profit. What does this mean? Lower profit means lower salaries; lower salaries means less spending in the economy; less spending in the economy means the firms suffer; the firms suffer means the firms fire people. You can see where this is going. Here's an exceprt from the NYT article: Europe's long siesta, it seems, has finally reached its limit — a victim of chronic economic stagnation, deteriorating public finances and competition from low-wage countries in the enlarged European Union and in Asia. Most important, many Europeans now believe that shorter hours, once seen as a way of spreading work among more people, have done little to ease unemployment.   "We have created a leisure society, while the Americans have created a work society," said Klaus F. Zimmermann, the president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. "But our model does not work anymore. We are in the process of rethinking it." One of my favorite writers about these sorts of issues is  urlLink Henry Hazlitt . If you want to read something more modern than Bastiat, Hazlitt is the way to go. His most popular (and very easy-to-read) book is   Economics in One Lesson  . Some excerpts from one of his other books (  The conquest of poverty  ) are  urlLink available online . In  urlLink Chapter 14 , he addresses the spread-the-work schemes at the time the book was published, 1973: The existing Federal Wage-Flour Law has been on the books for many years. It provides that the employer must pay a 50 percent penalty overtime rate for all hours that an employee works in excess of 40 hours a week, no matter how high the employee's standard hourly rate of pay.  This provision was inserted at the insistence of the unions. Its purpose was to make it so costly for the employer to work men overtime that he would be obliged to take on additional workers.  Experience shows that the provision has in fact had the effect of narrowly restricting the length of the working week. In the ten-year period 1962 to 1971 inclusive, the average annual work-week in manufacturing varied only between a low of 39.8 hours in 1970 and a high of 41.3 hours in 1966. Even monthly changes do not show much variation. The lowest average working week in manufacturing in the fourteen months from June, 1971, to July, 1972, was 39.8 hours and the highest was 40.9 hours.  But it does not follow that the hour restriction either created more long-term jobs or yielded higher total payrolls than would have existed without the compulsory 50 percent overtime rate. No doubt in isolated cases more men have been employed than would otherwise have been. But the chief effect of the overtime law has been to raise production costs. Firms already working full standard time often have to refuse new orders because they cannot afford to pay the penalty overtime necessary to fill those orders. They cannot afford to take on new employees to meet what may be only a temporarily higher demand because they may also have to install an equivalent number of additional machines.  Higher production costs mean higher prices. They must therefore mean narrowed markets and smaller sales. They mean that fewer goods and services are produced. In the long run the interests of the whole body of workers must be adversely affected by compulsory overtime penalties.  All this is not to argue that there ought to be a longer work week, but rather that the length of the work week, and the scale of overtime rates, ought to be left to voluntary agreement between individual workers or unions and their employers. In any case, legal restrictions on the length of the working week cannot in the long run increase the number of jobs. To the extent that they can do that in the short run, it must necessarily be at the expense of production and of the real income of the whole body of workers. Of course, we must also understand that Hazlitt would never suggest abolishing all laws that ease the life of the worker--like child-labor laws; some economic pain is worth bearing for the salutary effect of good policies. However, his point (which Europe is finally realizing) is simply that you cannot slack off more than a reasonable amount (i.e., if almost everyone else in the world is willing to work more than you, your economy will suffer, noticeably).

      Recently I used the expression "bread and circuses" in a conversation, and I was asked for its origin. I had some ideas, which I explained, but since then I have decided to look into the matter a bit more. It turns out that the phrase has its origin in the writings of the Roman satirist  urlLink Juvenal . To understand what Juvenal was talking about, I had to review some history:  During the reign of  urlLink Tiberius  (AD 14-37), the second Roman emperor,  urlLink Sejanus  was the prefect of the  urlLink Praetorian Guard . Sejanus began to fawn upon Tiberius and, thereby, to win his confidence and, thereby, to acquire power. Finally, Tiberius got suspicious and sent a letter to the Senate from his "retirement home" in  urlLink Capri , alerting them of Sejanus' insidious motives. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was executed and dragged through the streets. (Also, keep in mind that with the supremacy of  urlLink Augustus  after the  urlLink Battle of Actium  in 31 BC, the republican constitution became defunct and the people lost much of their power. In the first year of his reign, AD 14, Tiberius transferred various rights--e.g., to appoint commanders--to the Senate.)   urlLink    Juvenal  Juvenal, in his Tenth Satire, described these events, in which he uses the now-famous Latin expression of appeasement,  panem et circenses , translated as either "bread and circuses" or "bread and races," referring to the Romans' willingness to support anyone who would distract them, after losing their power. I could not find this in English anywhere on the Internet, so here is a brief excerpt from the Tenth Satire, which is, in general, about the futility of aspirations. You can obtain all of his Satires  here .   Some are sent hurtling down by the virulent envy to which their power exposes them. Their long and impressive list of achievements ruins them. Down comes their statues, obeying the pull of the rope. Thereupon, axe-blows rain on the very wheels of their chariots, smashing them up; and the legs of the innocent horses are broken. Now the flames are hissing; bellows and furnace are bringing a glow to the head revered by the people. The mighty Sejanus is crackling. Then, from the face regarded as number two in the whole of the world, come pitchers, basins, saucepans, and piss-pots. Frame your door with laurels; drag a magnificent bull, whitened with chalk, to the Capitol. They're dragging Sejanus along by a hook for all to see. Everyone's jubilant. 'Look, what lips he had! What a face! You can take it from me that I never cared for the fellow. But what was the charge that brought him down? Who informed, who gave him away, what witnesses proved it?' 'Nothing like that. A large, long-winded letter arrived from Capri.'             'Fine...I ask no more.'                                    But what's the reaction of Remus' mob? It supports the winner, as always, and turns on whoever is condemned. If Nortia had smiled on her Tuscan favorite, if the elderly prince had been caught off guard and sent to his death, the same public, at this very moment, would be hailing Sejanus as Augustus. Long ago, the people cast off its worries, when we stopped selling our votes. A body that used to confer commands, legions, rods, and everything else, has now narrowed its scope, and is eager and anxious for two things only: bread and races.

      A couple days ago I read the book   The Road to Serfdom   by  urlLink F. A. Hayek , who was an Austrian economist and Nobel laureate. He's of the so-called Austrian school of economics, which pushes for liberty in the classical sense (what might nowadays be called a libertarian approach) and capitalism. The book is quite good, and I'll probably post some quotes from it later. But yesterday I also read an article about gay marriage that included a quote from Hayek (albeit from a different book called   The Counter-Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason  ).   In this paragraph, Hayek makes a terse and, it seems to me, cogent argument for considering tradition to be a reason to do something, even if we do not understand why we do it. Obviously, he is not saying that just because something has been happening it should continue happening (as Nick pointed out, this would justify everything from slavery to misogyny, both of which are undesirable); rather, he is merely arguing against the people who will not allow tradition to influence their behavior at all. His main point is that our ability to understand the world is limited, and it is possible that the very things we've been doing for a long time but haven't understood may be the ones responsible for holding our civilization together:  It may indeed prove to be far the most difficult and not the least important task for human reason rationally to comprehend its own limitations. It is essential for the growth of reason that as individuals we should bow to forces and obey principles which we cannot hope fully to understand, yet on which the advance and even the preservation of civilization depends. Historically this has been achieved by the influence of the various religious creeds and by traditions and superstitions which made man submit to those forces by an appeal to his emotions rather than to his reason. The most dangerous stage in the growth of civilization may well be that in which man has come to regard all these beliefs as superstitions and refuses to accept or to submit to anything which he does not rationally understand. The rationalist whose reason is not sufficient to teach him those limitations of the powers of conscious reason, and who despises all the institutions and customs which have not been consciously designed, would thus become the destroyer of the civilization built upon them. This may well prove a hurdle which man will repeatedly reach, only to be thrown back into barbarism. The original article where this was quoted, by the way, is  urlLink here . It's from  urlLink Reason magazine , which is, in general, quite a good and iconoclastic publication.   So, how does this relate to gay marriage? Well, it seems to provide an argument against it on the grounds that heterosexual marriage has been the tradition for as long as man has existed, and, according to the quote, we should consider continuing it even though our brilliant social scientists can find nothing wrong with allowing gays to marry. After all, the social scientists have been trying to engineer society since the Englightenment (even further back, the Greek philosophers also tried the same--e.g.,  Plato's  Republic  ), and they often fail miserably. (Consider communism.) The point is that just because a social scientist believes that a certain policy will do no harm to the world is not a good reason to think so.  One other tradition that comes immediately to mind is religion. Hayek's argument can be applied to this phenomenon, which is at least as old as history itself. Since the Greeks began to light the darkness of the universe with their science (which actually comes from the Latin word for knowledge,  scientia , which to the Romans meant any systematic study, much like the word philosophy), religion has suffered; as the mysterious became the commonplace, religion suffered. And, indeed, today, there are fewer and fewer everyday phenomena that remain unexplained by science. (Of course, as more becomes known, the specialists realize that even more is yet unknown--but does the laity have the insight of the specialists?) Generally, creation stories of all major religions have been shown impossible and inaccurate. But perhaps religion serves some purpose  even if its precepts are false . It does not seem obvious to me that knowing the most truth leads to the most happiness or to the greatest civilization (though perhaps it is true--I only claim it is not trivially true). (One interesting fact that I was unable to verify is that the psychologist Abraham Maslow did a study that showed that Holocaust survivors tended to have strong religious beliefs: see  urlLink here .)

      Welcome to my blog.  With this first post, I'd like to briefly explain the purpose of this blog and a bit about how I think, so everything else makes a bit more sense.  I got the idea to start this today, after trying unsuccessfully to start a new group on  urlLink Orkut  (for those of you who know what it is), the description of which was to be an quote from an article I just read. However, it turned out that the quote was longer than the 1024 character limit imposed by Orkut, so I couldn't do it. However, the thought is extraordinarily insightful, so I started thinking about alternatives.  Then I realized that I fairly often read interesting articles, and I often end up telling my ideas about some of them to some people. But it would be better if I could centralize my thoughts, because then anyone who wished could see them, and when people respond (which I've thus far handled through email or in person), others will be able to read the responses (which are often quite good--you guys are smart) and benefit from them. A blog seems like a good medium for this.  So mostly I'll be posting my thoughts on various topics. I'll try to include sources and whatever background I have whenever possible so that you guys can prove me wrong more easily.  Finally, I should say a word about how I deal with ideas. In general, I try to ignore whatever is considered the accepted view on the matter and look at the evidence purely. (Also, since I'm using this blog to help myself think through various ideas, some of my posts might have the verisimilitude of pedantry.) Naturally, this will lead to many posts that are not politically correct. But since I think that political correctness is a scourge of our society (censorship by another name), I'm not ashamed of this at all. If you don't want your views disturbed, I suggest you stop reading.  Caveat lector !  Now, the most important point is that the positions for which I argue are not necessarily the ones I believe to be true. Often I'll play the Devil's advocate, just to provide a balance in thought (since I think that the only way to determine which position is most likely to be true requires hearing good arguments for all positions, and since often some positions are very weakly supported, I have to provide arguments for esoteric positions--after all, this blog is, in part, to help me think through various ideas). Sometimes, obviously, the ideas I argue for I will also believe to be true--but there is not guarantee, so make no assumptions.

      Excerpts from David Brooks'  urlLink recent editorial  in the  NYT :  I know that John Kerry shares my values. I know that John Kerry shares your values. I know that John Kerry shares John Edwards's values, who also, by the way, shares my values. I know they both share your accountant's values, your butcher's values, your mechanic's values. If a Martian showed up from outer space, they'd share its values, too.  [...]  And, of course, the candidates can't just go be themselves and let us draw our own conclusions about their values. These days all campaigns are based on the consultants' conviction that voters are like particularly slow-witted sheep who have to be told exactly what to think.  [...]  This is like going on a date with someone who spends the whole night telling you what a great personality he or she has.   "What are your hobbies?"  "I've got a great personality."  "But what are your interests?"  "Have I mentioned my personality, which is really, really great?!"

      "It was so hot today, executives from the NAACP tried to meet with President Bush just so they could get the cold shoulder."  "What do Martha Stewart and President Bush have in common? They're both afraid of a long sentence."  "In an interview on the Today Show, First Lady Laura Bush said that she told her daughters when they're out there on the campaign trail with their father, 'Stand up straight and keep their hair out of their eyes.' Which is the same thing Kerry told John Edwards."  "John Kerry talked about how there are two Americas.  He said he knew there were two Americas, 'cause every night he has to drive home from the other America to get home to his America."  "Today, John Edwards said Vice President Dick Cheney is out of touch with the lives of most Americans.  Cheney denied the charge from his underground bunker at an undisclosed location."  "Looks like Howard Dean will be speaking at the Democratic convention.  On the first night, they've got Howard speaking first.  I guess they're using him to test the sound system."  "Yesterday, Republicans in the Senate failed in their attempt to pass a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  They said if the Founding Fathers ever thought gay marriage was even possible they would have banned it in the Constitution.  See, I don't know about that.  Do you ever see those paintings of the Founding Fathers?  The powdered wigs, the frilly shirts, the big leg things there, the stockings?

       Phytoplankton may be small, but that doesn't mean they can't do big things -- like change the weather to suit their needs.   A recent study funded by NASA's Earth Science Department shows that the tiny sea plants release high quantities of cloud-forming compounds on days when the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays are especially strong. The compounds evaporate into the air through a series of chemical processes that result in especially reflective clouds. This, in turn, blocks the radiation from bothering the phytoplankton.  For the original article, click  urlLink here . (Thanks Ian for pointing it out.)

      We all know that Bush pronounces the word nuclear like "nucular." I talked to Nick about this, and he emphasized the point that Bush is incorrect in his pronunciation; of course, Nick is a die-hard Democrat, so this was to be expected. Talking to Joanna, however, the issue gained complexity. It turns out that the word has three accepted pronunciation, according to  urlLink Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary , the most authoritative American English dictionary (second only to the gargantuan  urlLink Oxford English Dictionary  in general linguistic authority). If you look at Merriam-Webster's  urlLink entry  and click on the third speaker icon, you'll hear Bush's pronunciation. In fact, their usage note declares  Though disapproved of by many, pronunciations ending in \-ky&-l&r\ have been found in widespread use among educated speakers including scientists, lawyers, professors, congressmen, U.S. cabinet members, and at least one U.S. president and one vice president. While most common in the U.S., these pronunciations have also been heard from British and Canadian speakers.  For a brief and critical Slate article about this issue (including an explanation of Bush's pronunciation), click  urlLink here .

      The anecdote is an endemic Russian form of humor. Recently, someone asked to hear a few, and I figured I might as well share them with everyone else, too. Be warned that in traditional Russian culture, misogyny-of-sorts is not rare (or, at least, feminism is a dirty word). A short characterization of Russian anecdotes by a sociology professor at Moscow State University (in English) is available  urlLink here . I've selected a couple (from  urlLink here ), which I present below first in their Russian original and then in my haphazard English translation.  Anecdote 1:  Решивший жениться мужчина долго думал, какую из трех влюбленных в него девушек взять в жены. Он решил каждой дать  по 5000 долларов и выяснить, как они ими будут распоряжаться. Первая накупила дорогой одежды, лучшей косметики, сходила  в элитный салон красоты - в общем, сделала все, чтобы выглядеть идеально, и сказала: "Я очень люблю тебя и хочу, чтобы все знали, что у тебя самая красивая жена в городе". Вторая истратила все деньги на своего потенциального мужа, купив ему новые костюмы, рубашки, инструменты для автомобиля, и сказала: "Ты - самое главное для меня, поэтому я истратила на тебя все деньги". Третья пустила 5000 долларов в оборот, заработала еще 5000 и все вернула мужчине: "Я очень люблю тебя. Я сделала это, чтобы ты понял, что я умна и нерасточительна". Мужчина подумал - и женился на той, у которой грудь была больше.  A man, having decided to get married, must decide among three ladies who are in love with him. He decided to give each lady 5000 dollars to see how they will use the money. The first bought expensive clothes, the finest makeup, went to an elite beauty salon--overall she did everything to look her best, and said, "I really love you and want everyone to know that you have the prettiest wife in the city." The second spent all her money on her potential husband; she bought him a new suit, shirt, tools for his car, and said, "You are the most important thing for me, so I spent all the money on you.." The third invested the 5000 dollars, earned 5000 more, and returned all of it to the man: "I really love you. I did this so that you would understand that I am smart and not a spendthrift." The man pondered for a while and married the one who had the biggest bust.  Anecdote 2:  Как приходят на свидание француженка и русская... Француженка: Если у вас свидание назначено на 7, то она приходит без десяти, с прекрасным макияжем и запахом лучших духов. Вы ведете ее в кинотеатр, причем берете билеты на последний ряд и, естественно, целуетесь весь сеанс. Затем вы ужинаете в лучшем ресторане и ведете ее к себе домой. Если у вас на столе стоит бутылка вина, она говорит, что это ее любимое вино. Если у вас ярко горит свет, то она просит приглушить его, мотивируя это тем, что он ей режет глаза. Ночь проходит в страстной любви, после чего она засыпает и спит до утра спокойно. Утром, когда вы просыпаетесь в 7, она уже встала, успела у вас дома все разведать и приносит вам в постель завтрак и кофе. Когда вы уходите на работу, она говорит, что вам по пути и рассказывает вам, где и когда ее можно найти в дальнейшем...  Русская: Если у вас свидание назначено на 7, то в 7 ее нет. Мало того, ее нет в 7.10, 7.20 и в 7.30. Наконец, в 8 она прибегает, взмыленная, наполовину накрашенная, говоря, что задержалась с больной мамой. Вы берете билеты в ближайший клуб, причем, через три места, чтобы никто не подумал, что вы знакомы. После этого вы наскоро перекусываете в забегаловке и, наконец, приводите ее к себе домой. Если у вас на столе стоит бутылка вина, она говорит, что она непьющая. Если вы пытаетесь погасить свет, она говорит, что вы ее не за ту принимаете. В 11 она уходит. В 11.30 она продолжает уходить. В 12 она все еще уходит, говоря, что больная мама ее заждалась. Наконец, в 12.30 вы ее имеете где-то в районе дверной ручки. Ночью она просыпается дважды: первый раз, чтобы спросить, любите ли вы ее, а второй - чтобы узнать, что вы после всего о ней думаете... Утром, когда вы просыпаетесь в 10 и видите, что безнадежно опоздали, она еще спит. Когда вы ее будите и мягко намекаете на то, что пора бы и честь знать, она говорит, что ей у вас понравилось, и она отсюда вообще никуда уходить не собирается...  How French and Russian girls come to dates... French girl: If your date was to be at 7, then she comes ten minutes early, with perfect makeup, smelling of the best perfume. You take her to a movie theater; and you get tickets for the last row and, naturally, make out with her during the whole movie. Then you have dinner at the best restaurant and take her home. If you have a bottle of wine on your table, she says that it's her favorite wine. If your lights are bright, she asks you to dim them, saying that the light bothers her eyes. The night passes in passionate love, after which she falls asleep and sleeps calmly until the morning. In the morning, when you wake up at 7, she has already gotten up, figured out your place, and brings you breakfast and coffee in bed. When you leave for work, she tells you when and where you can find her in the future... Russian girl: If your date was set at 7, then at 7 she is not there. What's more, she's not there at 7:10, 7:20, or 7:30. Finally, at 8 she runs up in a mess, half her makeup on, saying that she was held up with her sick mother. You get tickets to the nearest club, making sure to get seats three apart, lest anyone suspects you are together. After that, you quickly grab a bite to eat at a hole-in-the-wall, and, finally, take her home. If on your table is a bottle of wine, she says that she doesn't drink. If you try to turn off the lights, she says that you're taking her for the wrong kind of girl. At 11 she leaves. At 11:30 she continues leaving. At 12 she is still leaving, saying that her sick mom is sick of waiting for her. Finally, at 12:30 you have her in the vicinity of the door handle. At night she wakes up twice; first, to ask you whether you love her, and second to find out what you think about her, after all... In the morning, when you wake up at 10 and realize that you are hopelessly late, she's still sleeping. When you wake her and gently hint that it's time to go, she says that she likes it at your place, and that she has no plans on leaving...

         Governor Jeb Bush was asked to list the angles on a three-four-five triangle, a question that appears on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, which high school students must pass to graduate. Bush replied: "I don't know, 125, 90, and whatever remains of 180?" ( urlLink Source )  To be fair, this is not a trivial problem. One way of solving it to to first check that we are dealing with a right triangle by using the  urlLink Pythagorean theorem . That means one of the angles is 90 degrees. The longest side (the hypotenuse) must have length 5. Then we use the fact that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the length of the side oposite the angle divided by the length of the adjacent side (which is not the hypotenuse). Thus, we take the inverse tangent of 3/4 to find that the angle is about 36.9 degrees. Since all the angles of a triangle add up to 180, the remaining angle must be about 53.1.

      The New York Times Why Israel Needs a Fence  July 13, 2004  By  urlLink Benjamin Netanyahu    JERUSALEM - While the  urlLink advisory finding  by the  urlLink International Court of Justice  last week that Israel's barrier in the West Bank is illegal may be cheered by the terrorists who would kill Israeli civilians, it does not change the fact that none of the arguments against the security fence have any merit.   First, Israel is not building the fence on territory that under international law can be properly called "Palestinian land." The fence is being built in disputed territories that Israel won in a defensive war in 1967 from a Jordanian occupation that was never recognized by the international community. Israel and the Palestinians both claim ownership of this land. According to  urlLink Security Council Resolution 242 , this dispute is to be resolved by a negotiated peace that provides Israel with secure and recognized boundaries.   Second, the fence is not a permanent political border but a temporary security barrier. A fence can always be moved. Recently, Israel removed 12 miles of the fence to ease Palestinian daily life. And last month,  urlLink Israel's Supreme Court   urlLink ordered  the government to reroute 20 more miles of the fence for that same purpose. In fact, the indefensible line on which many have argued the fence should run - that which existed between Israel and the Arab lands before the 1967 war - is the only line that would have nothing to do with security and everything to do with politics. A line that is genuinely based on security would include as many Jews as possible and as few Palestinians as possible within the fence.   That is precisely what Israel's security fence does. By running into less than 12 percent of the West Bank, the fence will include about 80 percent of Jews and only 1 percent of Palestinians who live within the disputed territories. The fence thus will block attempts by terrorists based in Palestinian cities to reach major Israeli population centers.   Third, despite what some have argued, fences have proven highly effective against terrorism. Of the hundreds of suicide bombings that have taken place in Israel, only one has originated from the Gaza area, where Hamas and Islamic Jihad are headquartered. Why? Because Gaza is surrounded by a security fence. Even though it is not complete, the West Bank security fence has already drastically reduced the number of suicide attacks.   The obstacle to peace is not the fence but Palestinian leaders who, unlike past leaders like Anwar Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, have yet to abandon terrorism and the illegitimate goal of destroying Israel. Should Israel reach a compromise with a future Palestinian leadership committed to peace that requires adjustments to the fence, those changes will be made. And if that peace proves genuine and lasting, there will be no reason for a fence at all.   Instead of placing Palestinian terrorists and those who send them on trial, the United Nations-sponsored international court placed the Jewish state in the dock, on the charge that Israel is harming the Palestinians' quality of life. But saving lives is more important than preserving the quality of life. Quality of life is always amenable to improvement. Death is permanent. The Palestinians complain that their children are late to school because of the fence. But too many of our children never get to school - they are blown to pieces by terrorists who pass into Israel where there is still no fence.   In the last four years, Palestinian terrorists have attacked Israel's buses, cafes, discos and pizza shops, murdering 1,000 of our citizens. Despite this unprecedented savagery, the court's 60-page opinion mentions terrorism only twice, and only in citations of Israel's own position on the fence. Because the court's decision makes a mockery of Israel's right to defend itself, the government of Israel will ignore it. Israel will never sacrifice Jewish life on the debased altar of "international justice."

      The Jewish  urlLink Talmud , "considered an authoritative record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories," has some interesting comments on sex. Keep in mind that this stuff is at least a thousand years old. I found some selected quotes in  urlLink this article . Below are some selections.  Talmud, Ketubot 61b “The times for conjugal duty prescribed in the Torah are: for men of independent means, every day; for laborers, twice a week; for donkey drivers, once a week; for camel drivers, once in thirty days; for sailors, once in six months.”  Talmud, Ketubot 48a “There must be close bodily contact during sex. This means that a husband must not treat his wife in the manner of the Persians, who perform their marital duties in their clothes.”  Mishneh Torah, Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9 “Since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally.”  My favorite (admittedly redacted):  Talmud, Niddah 13b “...Thou shall not practice masturbation...with foot.”  Now, riddle me  that .

         I am usually the last one to espouse hippie causes, but I see justice in this photo. After all, bullfighting is really just bull-torture. Consider the details, as described in  urlLink this web page :  A traditional bullfight consists of three stages. During the first stage, picadors, men atop heavily padded, blindfolded horses, approach the bull and drive pics into his neck muscles to begin the flow of blood to weaken the bull. The banderillos come next, working on foot to place "their banderillas (brightly adorned, barbed sticks) in the bull's shoulders in order to lower its head for the eventual kill." The blades of these spears continue to move and dig into the bull's back throughout the fight, causing bleeding and tissue damage. The bull may also suffer internal bleeding.   After the bull has been sufficiently weakened and his movements slowed, the matador enters to "fight" the animals. After dancing with the bull and taunting him for several minutes, in an effort to excite the crowd, the matador attempts a kill. The goal for a clean kill is to plunge the sword between the bull's withers into the aorta. However, it is not uncommon for the matador to miss, causing further torment until finally an executioner is called in to finish him off.  Though cruelty to animals has an intrinsic offensiveness, more importantly, we must consider that the enjoyment of  urlLink tauromachy --as does the enjoyment of all suffering--inspires cruelty in our own souls and hardens our own hearts.

      In all governments there is a war of power--i.e., the main question is  who shall have the power?  In particular, the fight is often between the power of the people to do what they want (i.e., liberty) and the power of the legislators to force society according to their will (e.g., socialism). The legislators' forced plans for society are justified to be "on behalf of the common good," while, in fact, they cannot ever be so--for if they were, the "common good" would freely choose them for itself.   The best defense of liberty I have ever read is in a small pamphlet by the 19th century economist  urlLink Frédéric Bastiat  called  The Law  or  La Loi . His argument is terrifically clear and convincing. The original is available for free in  urlLink English  and  urlLink French . The following are excerpts. For all those who doubt the relevance of this work, consider that Hillary Clinton  urlLink said  on June 28, 2004, "We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."  What, then, is law? It is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense.   Each of us has a natural right — from God — to defend his person, his liberty, and his property. These are the three basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely dependent upon the preservation of the other two. For what are our faculties but the extension of our individuality? And what is property but an extension of our faculties? If every person has the right to defend even by force — his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right — its reason for existing, its lawfulness — is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force — for the same reason — cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.   Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, contrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own individual rights. Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to destroy the equal rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separately can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force that is nothing more than the organized combination of the individual forces?   If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than this: The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause  justice  to reign over us all.   [...]  Man can live and satisfy his wants only by ceaseless labor; by the ceaseless application of his faculties to natural resources. This process is the origin of property.   But it is also true that a man may live and satisfy his wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others. This process is the origin of plunder.   Now since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain — and since labor is pain in itself — it follows that men will resort to plunder whenever plunder is easier than work. History shows this quite clearly. And under these conditions, neither religion nor morality can stop it.   When, then, does plunder stop? It stops when it becomes more painful and more dangerous than labor.   It is evident, then, that the proper purpose of law is to use the power of its collective force to stop this fatal tendency to plunder instead of to work. All the measures of the law should protect property and punish plunder.   But, generally, the law is made by one man or one class of men. And since law cannot operate without the sanction and support of a dominating force, this force must be entrusted to those who make the laws.   This fact, combined with the fatal tendency that exists in the heart of man to satisfy his wants with the least possible effort, explains the almost universal perversion of the law. Thus it is easy to understand how law, instead of checking injustice, becomes the invincible weapon of injustice. It is easy to understand why the law is used by the legislator to destroy in varying degrees among the rest of the people, their personal independence by slavery, their liberty by oppression, and their property by plunder. This is done for the benefit of the person who makes the law, and in proportion to the power that he holds.  [...]  [T]here are two kinds of plunder: legal and illegal.  I do not think that illegal plunder, such as theft or swindling — which the penal code defines, anticipates, and punishes — can be called socialism. It is not this kind of plunder that systematically threatens the foundations of society. Anyway, the war against this kind of plunder has not waited for the command of these gentlemen. The war against illegal plunder has been fought since the beginning of the world. Long before the Revolution of February 1848 — long before the appearance even of socialism itself — France had provided police, judges, gendarmes, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds for the purpose of fighting illegal plunder. The law itself conducts this war, and it is my wish and opinion that the law should always maintain this attitude toward plunder.   But it does not always do this. Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Thus the beneficiaries are spared the shame, danger, and scruple which their acts would otherwise involve. Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons, and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim — when he defends himself — as a criminal. In short, there is a  legal plunder .  [...]  But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.   Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not only an evil itself, but also it is a fertile source for further evils because it invites reprisals. If such a law — which may be an isolated case — is not abolished immediately, it will spread, multiply, and develop into a system.   The person who profits from this law will complain bitterly, defending his  acquired rights . He will claim that the state is obligated to protect and encourage his particular industry; that this procedure enriches the state because the protected industry is thus able to spend more and to pay higher wages to the poor workingmen.   Do not listen to this sophistry by vested interests. The acceptance of these arguments will build legal plunder into a whole system. In fact, this has already occurred. The present-day delusion is an attempt to enrich everyone at the expense of everyone else; to make plunder universal under the pretense of organizing it.   [...]  Here I encounter the most popular fallacy of our times. It is not considered sufficient that the law should be just; it must be philanthropic. Nor is it sufficient that the law should guarantee to every citizen the free and inoffensive use of his faculties for physical, intellectual, and moral self-improvement. Instead, it is demanded that the law should directly extend welfare, education, and morality throughout the nation.   This is the seductive lure of socialism. And I repeat again: These two uses of the law are in direct contradiction to each other. We must choose between them. A citizen cannot at the same time be free and not free.   Mr. de Lamartine once wrote to me thusly: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program. You have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first."  In fact, it is impossible for me to separate the word  fraternity  from the word  voluntary . I cannot possibly understand how fraternity can be  legally  enforced without liberty being  legally  destroyed, and thus justice being  legally  trampled underfoot   [...]  You say: "There are persons who have no money," and you turn to the law. But the law is not a breast that fills itself with milk. Nor are the lacteal veins of the law supplied with milk from a source outside the society. Nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes have been  forced  to send it in. If every person draws from the treasury the amount that he has put in it, it is true that the law then plunders nobody. But this procedure does nothing for the persons who have no money. It does not promote equality of income. The law can be an instrument of equalization only as it takes from some persons and gives to other persons. When the law does this, it is an instrument of plunder.   [...]  The strange phenomenon of our times — one which will probably astound our descendants — is the doctrine based on this triple hypothesis: the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, and the infallibility of the legislator. These three ideas form the sacred symbol of those who proclaim themselves totally democratic.   The advocates of this doctrine also profess to be  social . So far as they are democratic, they place unlimited faith in mankind. But so far as they are social, they regard mankind as little better than mud. Let us examine this contrast in greater detail.   What is the attitude of the democrat when political rights are under discussion? How does he regard the people when a legislator is to be chosen? Ah, then it is claimed that the people have an instinctive wisdom; they are gifted with the finest perception; their will is always right; the general will cannot err; voting cannot be too universal.   When it is time to vote, apparently the voter is not to be asked for any guarantee of his wisdom. His will and capacity to choose wisely are taken for granted. Can the people be mistaken? Are we not living in an age of enlightenment? What! are the people always to be kept on leashes? Have they not won their rights by great effort and sacrifice? Have they not given ample proof of their intelligence and wisdom? Are they not adults? Are they not capable of judging for themselves? Do they not know what is best for themselves? Is there a class or a man who would be so bold as to set himself above the people, and judge and act for them? No, no, the people are and should be  free . They desire to manage their own affairs, and they shall do so.   But when the legislator is finally elected — ah! then indeed does the tone of his speech undergo a radical change. The people are returned to passiveness, inertness, and unconsciousness; the legislator enters into omnipotence. Now it is for him to initiate, to direct, to propel, and to organize. Mankind has only to submit; the hour of despotism has struck. We now observe this fatal idea: The people who, during the election, were so wise, so moral, and so perfect, now have no tendencies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downward into degradation.  [...]  Well, what liberty should the legislators permit people to have? Liberty of conscience? (But if this were permitted, we would see the people taking this opportunity to become atheists.)   Then liberty of education? (But parents would pay professors to teach their children immorality and falsehoods; besides, according to Mr. Thiers, if education were left to national liberty, it would cease to be national, and we would be teaching our children the ideas of the Turks or Hindus; whereas, thanks to this legal despotism over education, our children now have the good fortune to be taught the noble ideas of the Romans.)   Then liberty of labor? (But that would mean competition which, in turn, leaves production unconsumed, ruins businessmen, and exterminates the people.)   Perhaps liberty of trade? (But everyone knows — and the advocates of protective tariffs have proved over and over again — that freedom of trade ruins every person who engages in it, and that it is necessary to suppress freedom of trade in order to prosper.)   Possibly then, liberty of association? (But, according to socialist doctrine, true liberty and voluntary association are in contradiction to each other, and the purpose of the socialists is to suppress liberty of association precisely in order to force people to associate together in true liberty.)   Clearly then, the conscience of the social democrats cannot permit persons to have any liberty because they believe that the nature of mankind tends always toward every kind of degradation and disaster. Thus, of course, the legislators must make plans for the people in order to save them from themselves.   [...]  The claims of these organizers of humanity raise another question which I have often asked them and which, so far as I know, they have never answered: If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind? The organizers maintain that society, when left undirected, rushes headlong to its inevitable destruction because the instincts of the people are so perverse. The legislators claim to stop this suicidal course and to give it a saner direction. Apparently, then, the legislators and the organizers have received from Heaven an intelligence and virtue that place them beyond and above mankind; if so, let them show their titles to this superiority.   [...]  Please understand that I do not dispute their right to invent social combinations, to advertise them, to advocate them, and to try them upon themselves, at their own expense and risk. But I do dispute their right to impose these plans upon us by law — by force — and to compel us to pay for them with our taxes.   I do not insist that the supporters of these various social schools of thought — the Proudhonists, the Cabetists, the Fourierists, the Universitarists, and the Protectionists — renounce their various ideas. I insist only that they renounce this one idea that they have in common: They need only to give up the idea of  forcing us  to acquiesce to their groups and series, their socialized projects, their free-credit banks, their Graeco-Roman concept of morality, and their commercial regulations. I ask only that we be permitted to decide upon these plans for ourselves; that we not be forced to accept them, directly or indirectly, if we find them to be contrary to our best interests or repugnant to our consciences.

      WASHINGTON, DC—The Bush Administration is awaiting congressional approval for an official act of war against high-speed DSL service provider Qwest, White House officials confirmed Tuesday. "After two weeks of trying to peaceably resolve our differences with Qwest, we have decided that this poor customer service will not stand," Bush said in a televised address. "I waited in the Oval Office all day for the technician to show up, and then, when I called them to find out where he was, I was transferred to another phone rep and got disconnected. We will begin bombarding them with tersely worded e-mails as early as next week." This marks the third time Bush has declared war this month, following conflicts with DIRECTV and the Potomac Electric Power Company.  ( urlLink link )

         My favorite person in the world, Cornel West, in his learned role as a Princeton professor, has invited a rapper from the group "OutKast" to inspire (or "rap at") 50 high schoolers who are at a so-called educational program at Princeton this summer.   Of course, this does fit well with Cornel's previous experiences: indeed, he produced his own rap CD while a University Professor at Harvard.

      My past week at  urlLink Cato  was, to summarize very briefly, intriguing and exciting. I met some surprisingly interesting people and really did quite a good amount of thinking. The overall theme of the seminar can be summarized by the following anecdote:  Suppose you, an upstanding and honest citizen, find yourself in a back alley. Suddenly, nine thugs appear and notice the fat wallet in your back pocket. Not being criminals, they do not simply rob you. Rather, they tell you the whole group will now have an impromptu vote; the matter for consideration is, naturally, the “excess” money by which you are burdened. As you might expect, this totally democratic process results in a 9-to-1 decision to redistribute your wealth. Since you resist, they proceed to use “reasonable” force (backed by the popular will) to hold you down, take your money, and put it in their own pockets. All of this is democratically supported, naturally.   I mentioned this sort of issue in a previous  urlLink comment .

      In a victory for free trade, the  urlLink WTO   urlLink agreed  to eliminate farm subsidies from much of the world. Currently, many developed nations levy taxes on their populations and use the resulting money to pay local farmers more than the market dictates for their produce. Many of these subsidies derive from some sort of emotional and political considerations; but the reality is that this transfer payment costs all of us billions of dollars and impoverishes many developing nations, which are unable to compete with our inflated prices.

         Until July 30, I'll be at the  urlLink Cato Institute 's  urlLink Summer Seminar , which is a week-long series of lectures and discussions on liberty from the perspectives of various disciplines, including economics, philosophy, and psychology. The list of speakers is varied and exciting, ranging from a professor of law at Stanford to an advisor to President Putin of Russia. You can see my schedule  urlLink here .  What is Cato about? From  urlLink this page :  Today, those who subscribe to the principles of the American Revolution--individual liberty, limited government, the free market, and the rule of law--call themselves by a variety of terms, including conservative, libertarian, classical liberal, and liberal. We see problems with all of those terms. "Conservative" smacks of an unwillingness to change, of a desire to preserve the status quo. Only in America do people seem to refer to free-market capitalism--the most progressive, dynamic, and ever-changing system the world has ever known--as conservative. Additionally, many contemporary American conservatives favor state intervention in some areas, most notably in trade and into our private lives.   "Classical liberal" is a bit closer to the mark, but the word "classical" connotes a backward-looking philosophy.   Finally, "liberal" may well be the perfect word in most of the world--the liberals in societies from China to Iran to South Africa to Argentina are supporters of human rights and free markets--but its meaning has clearly been corrupted by contemporary American liberals.   The Jeffersonian philosophy that animates Cato's work has increasingly come to be called "libertarianism" or "market liberalism." It combines an appreciation for entrepreneurship, the market process, and lower taxes with strict respect for civil liberties and skepticism about the benefits of both the welfare state and foreign military adventurism.   The market-liberal vision brings the wisdom of the American Founders to bear on the problems of today. As did the Founders, it looks to the future with optimism and excitement, eager to discover what great things women and men will do in the coming century. Market liberals appreciate the complexity of a great society, they recognize that socialism and government planning are just too clumsy for the modern world. It is--or used to be--the conventional wisdom that a more complex society needs more government, but the truth is just the opposite. The simpler the society, the less damage government planning does. Planning is cumbersome in an agricultural society, costly in an industrial economy, and impossible in the information age. Today collectivism and planning are outmoded and backward, a drag on social progress.   Market liberals have a cosmopolitan, inclusive vision for society. We reject the bashing of gays, Japan, rich people, and immigrants that contemporary liberals and conservatives seem to think addresses society's problems. We applaud the liberation of blacks and women from the statist restrictions that for so long kept them out of the economic mainstream. Our greatest challenge today is to extend the promise of political freedom and economic opportunity to those who are still denied it, in our own country and around the world.

      AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch Labour party wants to pass a law making unsolicited toe-licking an offence after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime.      A police spokesman said on Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he would sneak up on them and begin to lick their toes.   "The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but there is really nothing criminal about it," the spokesman said.   Dutch press reports said the man, who is about 35, had been licking the toes of strangers for about three years but was only recently caught by police.   Peter van Heemst, a Labour member of parliament, asked Christian Democrat Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner on Friday to explain why Dutch laws forbid littering but not uninvited toe-licking. van Heemst demanded an amendment prohibiting it.   "It is a violation of one's privacy and one's physical integrity," he told a local news agency. "The norm... is that no one should touch your body if you haven't asked them first."   A spokesman for Donner said the minister could not immediately comment.  ( urlLink source )

       This is a Letter to the Editor from the NYT published today.  To the Editor:  In an Aug. 1 letter, a former Foreign Service officer appears to take it as a given that the main cause of Islamic fundamentalism "is the Israeli-Palestinian problem." This conventional wisdom is common. It is also wrong.  The Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Muslim-led massacres in Algeria and Sudan, the killing by Syria of thousands of its own citizens - all of these expressions of barbarism in Islamic nations had nothing to do with Israel.   The sooner the professionals in the Foreign Service and State Department come to understand this, the sooner they can begin to deal with the real problem: that the Muslim world avoids responsibility and the need to change by blaming all of its ills on Israel, and that vast portions of the Western world simply accept this.   Yaakov Har-Oz Beit Shemesh, Israel, Aug. 1, 2004  ( urlLink source )

           urlLink Goblin Market   By  urlLink Christina Rossetti   MORNING and evening Maids heard the goblins cry: "Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy, come buy: Apples and quinces, Lemons and oranges, Plump unpecked cherries- Melons and raspberries, Bloom-down-cheeked peaches, Swart-headed mulberries, Wild free-born cranberries, Crab-apples, dewberries, Pine-apples, blackberries, Apricots, strawberries-- All ripe together In summer weather-- Morns that pass by, Fair eves that fly; Come buy, come buy; Our grapes fresh from the vine, Pomegranates full and fine, Dates and sharp bullaces, Rare pears and greengages, Damsons and bilberries, Taste them and try: Currants and gooseberries, Bright-fire-like barberries, Figs to fill your mouth, Citrons from the South, Sweet to tongue and sound to eye, Come buy, come buy."  Evening by evening Among the brookside rushes, Laura bowed her head to hear, Lizzie veiled her blushes: Crouching close together  In the cooling weather, With clasping arms and cautioning lips,  With tingling cheeks and finger-tips.  "Lie close," Laura said, Pricking up her golden head: We must not look at goblin men, We must not buy their fruits: Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots?" "Come buy," call the goblins Hobbling down the glen. "O! cried Lizzie, Laura, Laura, You should not peep at goblin men." Lizzie covered up her eyes Covered close lest they should look; Laura reared her glossy head, And whispered like the restless brook: "Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie, Down the glen tramp little men. One hauls a basket, One bears a plate, One lugs a golden dish Of many pounds' weight. How fair the vine must grow Whose grapes are so luscious; How warm the wind must blow Through those fruit bushes." "No," said Lizzie, "no, no, no; Their offers should not charm us, Their evil gifts would harm us." She thrust a dimpled finger In each ear, shut eyes and ran: Curious Laura chose to linger Wondering at each merchant man. One had a cat's face, One whisked a tail, One tramped at a rat's pace, One crawled like a snail, One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry, One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry. Lizzie heard a voice like voice of doves Cooing all together: They sounded kind and full of loves In the pleasant weather.  Laura stretched her gleaming neck Like a rush-imbedded swan, Like a lily from the beck, Like a moonlit poplar branch, Like a vessel at the launch When its last restraint is gone.  Backwards up the mossy glen Turned and trooped the goblin men, With their shrill repeated cry, "Come buy, come buy." When they reached where Laura was They stood stock still upon the moss, Leering at each other, Brother with queer brother; Signalling each other, Brother with sly brother. One set his basket down, One reared his plate; One began to weave a crown Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown (Men sell not such in any town); One heaved the golden weight Of dish and fruit to offer her: "Come buy, come buy," was still their cry. Laura stared but did not stir, Longed but had no money: The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste In tones as smooth as honey, The cat-faced purr'd, The rat-paced spoke a word Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard; One parrot-voiced and jolly Cried "Pretty Goblin" still for "Pretty Polly"; One whistled like a bird.  But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste: "Good folk, I have no coin; To take were to purloin: I have no copper in my purse, I have no silver either, And all my gold is on the furze That shakes in windy weather Above the rusty heather." "You have much gold upon your head," They answered altogether: "Buy from us with a golden curl." She clipped a precious golden lock, She dropped a tear more rare than pearl, Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red: Sweeter than honey from the rock, Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,  Clearer than water flowed that juice; She never tasted such before, How should it cloy with length of use? She sucked and sucked and sucked the more Fruits which that unknown orchard bore, She sucked until her lips were sore; Then flung the emptied rinds away, But gathered up one kernel stone, And knew not was it night or day As she turned home alone.  Lizzie met her at the gate Full of wise upbraidings: "Dear, you should not stay so late, Twilight is not good for maidens; Should not loiter in the glen In the haunts of goblin men. Do you not remember Jeanie, How she met them in the moonlight, Took their gifts both choice and many, Ate their fruits and wore their flowers Plucked from bowers Where summer ripens at all hours? But ever in the moonlight She pined and pined away; Sought them by night and day, Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray; Then fell with the first snow, While to this day no grass will grow Where she lies low: I planted daisies there a year ago That never blow. You should not loiter so." "Nay hush," said Laura. "Nay hush, my sister: I ate and ate my fill, Yet my mouth waters still; To-morrow night I will Buy more," and kissed her. "Have done with sorrow; I'll bring you plums to-morrow Fresh on their mother twigs, Cherries worth getting; You cannot think what figs My teeth have met in, What melons, icy-cold  Piled on a dish of gold Too huge for me to hold,  What peaches with a velvet nap, Pellucid grapes without one seed: Odorous indeed must be the mead Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink, With lilies at the brink, And sugar-sweet their sap."  Golden head by golden head, Like two pigeons in one nest Folded in each other's wings, They lay down, in their curtained bed: Like two blossoms on one stem, Like two flakes of new-fallen snow, Like two wands of ivory Tipped with gold for awful kings. Moon and stars beamed in at them, Wind sang to them lullaby, Lumbering owls forbore to fly, Not a bat flapped to and fro Round their rest: Cheek to cheek and breast to breast Locked together in one nest.  Early in the morning When the first cock crowed his warning, Neat like bees, as sweet and busy, Laura rose with Lizzie:  Fetched in honey, milked the cows, Aired and set to rights the house, Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat, Cakes for dainty mouths to eat, Next churned butter, whipped up cream, Fed their poultry, sat and sewed; Talked as modest maidens should  Lizzie with an open heart, Laura in an absent dream, One content, one sick in part; One warbling for the mere bright day's delight, One longing for the night.  At length slow evening came--  They went with pitchers to the reedy brook; Lizzie most placid in her look, Laura most like a leaping flame. They drew the gurgling water from its deep  Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags, Then turning homeward said: "The sunset flushes Those furthest loftiest crags; Come, Laura, not another maiden lags, No wilful squirrel wags, The beasts and birds are fast asleep." But Laura loitered still among the rushes And said the bank was steep.  And said the hour was early still, The dew not fallen, the wind not chill: Listening ever, but not catching The customary cry, "Come buy, come buy," With its iterated jingle Of sugar-baited words: Not for all her watching Once discerning even one goblin Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling; Let alone the herds That used to tramp along the glen, In groups or single, Of brisk fruit-merchant men.  Till Lizzie urged, "O Laura, come, I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look: You should not loiter longer at this brook: Come with me home.  The stars rise, the moon bends her arc, Each glow-worm winks her spark, Let us get home before the night grows dark; For clouds may gather even  Though this is summer weather, Put out the lights and drench us through; Then if we lost our way what should we do?"   Laura turned cold as stone To find her sister heard that cry alone, That goblin cry, "Come buy our fruits, come buy." Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit? Must she no more such succous pasture find, Gone deaf and blind? Her tree of life drooped from the root: She said not one word in her heart's sore ache; But peering thro' the dimness, naught discerning, Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way; So crept to bed, and lay Silent 'til Lizzie slept; Then sat up in a passionate yearning, And gnashed her teeth for balked desire, and wept As if her heart would break.  Day after day, night after night, Laura kept watch in vain,  In sullen silence of exceeding pain. She never caught again the goblin cry: "Come buy, come buy," She never spied the goblin men  Hawking their fruits along the glen:  But when the noon waxed bright Her hair grew thin and gray; She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn To swift decay, and burn Her fire away.  One day remembering her kernel-stone She set it by a wall that faced the south; Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root, Watched for a waxing shoot, But there came none; It never saw the sun, It never felt the trickling moisture run: While with sunk eyes and faded mouth She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees False waves in desert drouth With shade of leaf-crowned trees, And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.  She no more swept the house, Tended the fowls or cows,  Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat, Brought water from the brook:  But sat down listless in the chimney-nook And would not eat.  Tender Lizzie could not bear To watch her sister's cankerous care, Yet not to share. She night and morning Caught the goblins' cry: "Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy, come buy." Beside the brook, along the glen She heard the tramp of goblin men, The voice and stir Poor Laura could not hear; Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,  But feared to pay too dear,  She thought of Jeanie in her grave, Who should have been a bride; But who for joys brides hope to have Fell sick and died In her gay prime, In earliest winter-time, With the first glazing rime, With the first snow-fall of crisp winter-time.  Till Laura, dwindling, Seemed knocking at Death's door: Then Lizzie weighed no more Better and worse, But put a silver penny in her purse, Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze At twilight, halted by the brook, And for the first time in her life Began to listen and look.  Laughed every goblin When they spied her peeping: Came towards her hobbling, Flying, running, leaping, Puffing and blowing, Chuckling, clapping, crowing, Clucking and gobbling, Mopping and mowing, Full of airs and graces, Pulling wry faces, Demure grimaces,  Cat-like and rat-like,  Ratel and wombat-like, Snail-paced in a hurry, Parrot-voiced and whistler, Helter-skelter, hurry-skurry, Chattering like magpies, Fluttering like pigeons, Gliding like fishes, -- Hugged her and kissed her; Squeezed and caressed her; Stretched up their dishes, Panniers and plates: "Look at our apples Russet and dun, Bob at our cherries  Bite at our peaches, Citrons and dates, Grapes for the asking, Pears red with basking Out in the sun, Plums on their twigs;  Pluck them and suck them, Pomegranates, figs."  "Good folk," said Lizzie, Mindful of Jeanie, "Give me much and many"; --  Held out her apron, Tossed them her penny. "Nay, take a seat with us, Honor and eat with us," They answered grinning;  "Our feast is but beginning. Night yet is early,  Warm and dew-pearly, Wakeful and starry: Such fruits as these  No man can carry; Half their bloom would fly, Half their dew would dry, Half their flavor would pass by. Sit down and feast with us, Be welcome guest with us, Cheer you and rest with us." "Thank you," said Lizzie; "but one waits At home alone for me: So, without further parleying,  If you will not sell me any Of your fruits though much and many, Give me back my silver penny I tossed you for a fee." They began to scratch their pates, No longer wagging, purring, But visibly demurring, Grunting and snarling. One called her proud,  Cross-grained, uncivil;  Their tones waxed loud, Their looks were evil. Lashing their tails They trod and hustled her, Elbowed and jostled her, Clawed with their nails, Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking, Tore her gown and soiled her stocking, Twitched her hair out by the roots, Stamped upon her tender feet, Held her hands and squeezed their fruits Against her mouth to make her eat.  White and golden Lizzie stood, Like a lily in a flood, Like a rock of blue-veined stone Lashed by tides obstreperously, -- Like a beacon left alone  In a hoary roaring sea, Sending up a golden fire, -- Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree  White with blossoms honey-sweet Sore beset by wasp and bee, -- Like a royal virgin town Topped with gilded dome and spire Close beleaguered by a fleet Mad to tear her standard down.  One may lead a horse to water, Twenty cannot make him drink. Though the goblins cuffed and caught her, Coaxed and fought her, Bullied and besought her, Scratched her, pinched her black as ink, Kicked and knocked her, Mauled and mocked her, Lizzie uttered not a word; Would not open lip from lip Lest they should cram a mouthful in; But laughed in heart to feel the drip Of juice that syruped all her face, And lodged in dimples of her chin,  And streaked her neck which quaked like curd. At last the evil people, Worn out by her resistance, Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit Along whichever road they took, Not leaving root or stone or shoot. Some writhed into the ground, Some dived into the brook With ring and ripple. Some scudded on the gale without a sound, Some vanished in the distance.   In a smart, ache, tingle, Lizzie went her way; Knew not was it night or day; Sprang up the bank, tore through the furze, Threaded copse and dingle, And heard her penny jingle Bouncing in her purse, -- Its bounce was music to her ear. She ran and ran As if she feared some goblin man Dogged her with gibe or curse Or something worse: But not one goblin skurried after, Nor was she pricked by fear; The kind heart made her windy-paced That urged her home quite out of breath with haste And inward laughter.  She cried "Laura," up the garden, "Did you miss me ? Come and kiss me. Never mind my bruises, Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices Squeezed from goblin fruits for you, Goblin pulp and goblin dew. Eat me, drink me, love me; Laura, make much of me: For your sake I have braved the glen And had to do with goblin merchant men."   Laura started from her chair, Flung her arms up in the air, Clutched her hair: "Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted For my sake the fruit forbidden? Must your light like mine be hidden, Your young life like mine be wasted, Undone in mine undoing, And ruined in my ruin; Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?" She clung about her sister, Kissed and kissed and kissed her: Tears once again Refreshed her shrunken eyes, Dropping like rain After long sultry drouth; Shaking with aguish fear, and pain, She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.  Her lips began to scorch, That juice was wormwood to her tongue, She loathed the feast: Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung, Rent all her robe, and wrung Her hands in lamentable haste, And beat her breast. Her locks streamed like the torch Borne by a racer at full speed, Or like the mane of horses in their flight, Or like an eagle when she stems the light Straight toward the sun, Or like a caged thing freed, Or like a flying flag when armies run.  Swift fire spread through her veins, knocked at her heart, Met the fire smouldering there And overbore its lesser flame, She gorged on bitterness without a name: Ah! fool, to choose such part Of soul-consuming care! Sense failed in the mortal strife: Like the watch-tower of a town Which an earthquake shatters down, Like a lightning-stricken mast, Like a wind-uprooted tree Spun about, Like a foam-topped water-spout Cast down headlong in the sea, She fell at last; Pleasure past and anguish past, Is it death or is it life ?  Life out of death. That night long Lizzie watched by her, Counted her pulse's flagging stir, Felt for her breath, Held water to her lips, and cooled her face With tears and fanning leaves:  But when the first birds chirped about their eaves, And early reapers plodded to the place Of golden sheaves, And dew-wet grass Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass, And new buds with new day Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream, Laura awoke as from a dream, Laughed in the innocent old way, Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice; Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of gray, Her breath was sweet as May, And light danced in her eyes.  Days, weeks, months,years Afterwards, when both were wives With children of their own; Their mother-hearts beset with fears,  Their lives bound up in tender lives; Laura would call the little ones And tell them of her early prime, Those pleasant days long gone Of not-returning time: Would talk about the haunted glen, The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men, Their fruits like honey to the throat, But poison in the blood; (Men sell not such in any town;) Would tell them how her sister stood In deadly peril to do her good, And win the fiery antidote: Then joining hands to little hands Would bid them cling together, "For there is no friend like a sister, In calm or stormy weather, To cheer one on the tedious way, To fetch one if one goes astray, To lift one if one totters down, To strengthen whilst one stands."

      Let's say you're looking forward to waking up to this:   urlLink     but instead you get this:   urlLink     Wouldn't that suck? Yes. Yes it would--especially if you had just killed yourself plus a bunch of innocent people in hopes of getting the former. Nicholas Kristof of the NYT writes about this issue in  urlLink his op-ed piece for this week . An excerpt follows: The virgins are calling you," Mohamed Atta wrote reassuringly to his fellow hijackers just before 9/11.  It has long been a staple of Islam that Muslim martyrs will go to paradise and marry 72 black-eyed virgins. But a growing body of rigorous scholarship on the Koran points to a less sensual paradise - and, more important, may offer a step away from fundamentalism and toward a reawakening of the Islamic world.  [...]  The Koran is beautifully written, but often obscure. One reason is that the Arabic language was born as a written language with the Koran, and there's growing evidence that many of the words were Syriac or Aramaic.  For example, the Koran says martyrs going to heaven will get "hur," and the word was taken by early commentators to mean "virgins," hence those 72 consorts. But in Aramaic, hur meant "white" and was commonly used to mean "white grapes." Now, how about the paintings I chose? First of all, you can click on them for larger versions. And here is a description of the first painting (both images and information come from  urlLink The AMICO Library ), called "Mars and Venus, Allegory of Peace," by Louis Jean François Lagrenée: In this gentle allegory of peace by Louis Jean François Lagrenée, Mars, the Roman god of War, throws back the rich green bed curtains that frame the scene. As the drapery parts, the morning light spills in to reveal the form of the sleeping Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Mars gazes at her, utterly captivated by her beauty. Her love has tempered his fierce character, and his shield and sword lie abandoned on the floor. Echoing the lovers' bliss, a pair of white doves, symbolizing Peace, build a nest in Mars's helmet. Lagrenée created his finest works, including this small, jewel-like painting, around 1770. The lavish folds of drapery, the delicate play of light over fabric and skin, and the rich, restrained palette combine to create a captivatingly beautiful image.  The second is called "Still Life with Grapes on a Platter," by Isaak Soreau.

       The following essay accurately reflects my own views of metaphysics. Taken from   urlLink The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell  .   Remarks on Bertrand Russell's Theory of Knowledge  By Albert Einstein  When the editor asked me to write something about Bertrand Russell, my admiration and respect for that author at once induced me to say yes. I owe innumerably happy hours to the reading of Russell's works, something which I cannot say of any other contemporary scientific writer, with the exception of Thirsted Veiled. Soon, however, I discovered that it is easier to give such a promise than to fulfil it. I had promised to say something about Russell as a philosopher and epistemologist. After having in full confidence begun with it, I quickly recognized what a slippery field I had ventured upon, having, due to lack of experience, until now cautiously limited myself to the field of physics. The present difficulties of his science force the physicist to come to grips with philosophical problems to a greater degree than was the case with earlier generations. Although I shall not speak here of those difficulties, it was my concern with them, more than anything else, which led me to the position outlined in this essay.   In the evolution of philosophic thought through the centuries, the following question has played a major role: what knowledge is pure thought able to supply independently of sense perception? Is there any such knowledge? If not, what precisely is the relation between our knowledge and the raw material furnished by sense impressions? An almost boundless chaos of philosophical opinions corresponds to these questions and to a few others intimately connected with them. Nevertheless there is visible in this process of relatively fruitless but heroic endeavours a systematic trend of development, namely, an increasing scepticism concerning every attempt by means of pure thought to learn something about the "objective world," about the world of "things" in contrast to the world of mere "concepts and ideas." Be it said parenthetically that, just as on the part of a real philosopher, quotation marks are used here to introduce an illegitimate concept, which the reader is asked to permit for the moment, although the concept is suspect in the eyes of the philosophical police.   During philosophy's childhood it was rather generally believed that it is possible to find everything which can be known by means of mere reflection. It was an illusion which anyone can easily understand if, for a moment, he dismisses what he has learned from later philosophy and from natural science; he will not be surprised to find that Plato ascribed a higher reality to "ideas" than to empirically experienceable things. Even in Spinoza and as late as in Hegel this prejudice was the vitalizing force which seems still to have played the major role. Someone, indeed, might even raise the question whether, without something of this illusion, anything really great can be achieved in the realm of philosophic thought -- but we do not wish to ask this question.   This more aristocratic illusion concerning the unlimited penetrative power of thought has as its counterpart the more plebeian illusion of naive realism, according to which things "are" as they are perceived by us through our senses. This illusion dominates the daily life of men and of animals; it is also the point of departure in all of the sciences, especially of the natural sciences.   These two illusions cannot be overcome independently. The overcoming of naive realism has been relatively simple. In his introduction to his volume,   urlLink An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth  , Russell has characterized this process in a marvellously concise fashion:   We all start from "naive realism," i. e., the doctrine that things are what they seem. We think that grass is green, that stones are hard, and that snow is cold. But physics assures us that the greenness of grass, the hardness of stones, and the coldness of snow are not the greenness, hardness, and coldness that we know in our experience, but something very different. The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself. Thus science seems to be at war with itself: when it most means to be objective, it finds itself plunged into subjectivity against its will. Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows that naive realism is false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false. (pp. 14-15)  Apart from their masterful formulation these lines say something which had never previously occurred to me. For, superficially considered, the mode of thought in Berkeley and Hume seems to stand in contrast to the mode of thought in the natural sciences. However, Russell's just cited remark uncovers a connection: if Berkeley relies upon the fact that we do not directly grasp the "things" of the external world through our senses, but that only events causally connected with the presence of "things" reach our sense organs, then this is a consideration which gets is persuasive character from our confidence in the physical mode of thought. For, if one doubts the physical mode of thought in even its most general features, there is no necessity to interpolate, between the object and the act of vision, anything which separates the object from the subject and makes the "existence of the object" problematical.   It was, however, the very same physical mode of thought and its practical successes which have shaken the confidence in the possibility of understanding things and their relations by means of purely speculative thought. Gradually the conviction gained recognition that all knowledge about things is exclusively a working-over of the raw material furnished by the senses. In this general (and intentionally somewhat vaguely stated) form this sentence is probably today commonly accepted. But this conviction does not rest on the supposition that anyone has actually proved the impossibility of gaining knowledge of reality by means of pure speculation, but rather upon the fact that the empirical (in the above-mentioned sense) procedure alone has shown its capacity to be the source of knowledge. Galileo and Hume first upheld this principle with full clarity and decisiveness.   Hume saw that concepts which we must regard as essential, such as, for example, causal connection, cannot be gained from material given to us by the senses. This insight led him to a sceptical attitude as concerns knowledge of any kind. If one reads Hume's books, one is amazed that many and sometimes even highly esteemed philosophers after him have been able to write so much obscure stuff and even find grateful readers for it. Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best philosophers who came after him. One senses him in the reading of Russell's philosophical analyses, whose acumen and simplicity of expression have often reminded me of Hume.   Man has an intense desire for assured knowledge. That is why Hume's clear message seems crushing: the sensory raw material, the only source of our knowledge, through habit may lead us to belief and expectation but not to the knowledge and still less to the understanding of lawful relations. Then Kant took the stage with an idea which, though certainly untenable in the form in which he put it, signified a step towards the solution of Hume's dilemma: whatever in knowledge is of empirical origin is never certain (Hume). If, therefore, we have definitely assured knowledge, it must be grounded in reason itself. This is held to be the case, for example, in the propositions of geometry and in the principle of causality. These and certain other types of knowledge are, so to speak, a part of the implements of thinking and therefore do not previously have to be gained from sense data (i. e., they are a priori knowledge). Today everyone knows, of course, that the mentioned concepts contain nothing of the certainty, of the inherent necessity, which Kant had attributed to them. The following, however, appears to me to be correct in Kant's statement of the problem: in thinking we use, with a certain "right," concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience, if the situation is viewed from the logical point of view.   As a matter of fact, I am convinced that even much more is to be asserted: the concepts which arise in our thought and in our linguistic expressions are all -- when viewed logically -- the free creations of thought which cannot inductively be gained from sense experiences. This is not so easily noticed only because we have the habit of combining certain concepts and conceptual relations (propositions) so definitely which certain sense experiences that we do not become conscious of the gulf -- logically unbridgeable -- which separates the world of sensory experiences from the world of concepts and propositions.   Thus, for example, the series of integers is obviously an invention of the human mind, a self-created tool which simplifies the ordering of certain sensory experiences. But there is no way in which this concept could be made to grow, as it were, directly out of sense experiences. It is deliberately that I choose here the concept of a number, because it belongs to the pre-scientific thinking and because, in spite of that fact, its constructive character is still easily recognizable. The more, however, we turn to the most primitive concepts of everyday life, the more difficult it becomes amidst the mass of inveterate habits to recognize the concept as an independent creation of thinking. It was thus that the fateful conception -- fateful, that is to say, for an understanding of the here-existing conditions -- could arise, according to which the concepts originate from experience by way of "abstraction," i. e., through omission of a part of its content. I want to indicate now why this conception appears to me to be so fateful.   As soon as one is at home in Hume's critique one is easily led to believe that all those concepts and propositions which cannot be deduced from the sensory raw material are, on account of their "metaphysical" character, to be removed from thinking. For all thought acquires material content only through its relationship with that sensory material. This latter proposition I take to be entirely true; but I hold the prescription for thinking which is grounded on this proposition to be false. For this claim -- if only carried through consistently -- absolutely excludes thinking of any kind as "metaphysical."   In order that thinking might not degenerate into "metaphysics," or into empty talk, it is only necessary that enough propositions of the conceptual system be firmly enough connected with sensory experiences and that the conceptional system, in view of its task of ordering and surveying sense experience, should show as much unity and parsimony as possible. Beyond that, however, the "system" is (as regards logic) a free play with symbols according to (logically) arbitrarily given rules of the game. All this applies as much (and in the same manner) to the thinking in daily life as to the more consciously and systematically constructed thinking of the sciences.   It will now be clear what is meant if I make the following statement: by his clear critique Hume did not only advance philosophy in a decisive way but also -- though through no fault of his -- created a danger for philosophy in that, following his critique, a fateful "fear of metaphysics" arose which has come to be a malady of contemporary empiricistic philosophizing; this malady is the counterpart to that earlier philosophizing in the clouds, which thought it could neglect and dispense with what was given by the senses.   No matter how much one may admire the acute analysis which Russell has given us in his latest book on Meaning and Truth, it still seems to me that even there the specter of the metaphysical fear has caused some damage. For this fear seems to me, for example, to be the cause for conceiving of the "thing" as a "bundle of qualities," such that the "qualities" are to be taken from the sensory raw material. Now the fact that two things are said to be one and the same thing, if they coincide in all qualities, forces one to consider the geometrical relations between things as belonging to their qualities. (Otherwise one is forced to look upon the Afield Tower in Paris and a New York skyscraper as "the same thing.")* However, I see no "metaphysical" danger in taking the thing (the object in the sense of physics) as an independent concept into the system together with the proper spatio-temporal structure.   In view of these endeavours I am particularly pleased to note that, in the last chapter of the book, it finally turns out that one can, after all, not get along without "metaphysics." The only thing to which I take exception there is the bad intellectual conscience which shines through between the lines.   * Compare Russell's   urlLink An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth  , 119-120, chapter on "Proper Names."

       I am often asked what beliefs I have in the realm of religion, and I respond that I am theologically agnostic. I often have to note that the agnostic position is not one of insecurity or vague ignorance; it is, rather, precise and specific. A philosopher with whom I have many thoughts in common, Bertrand Russell, wrote an essay answering some mock questions regarding his religious belief (in the theological sense only, which is treated here to the exclusion of cultural aspects); I reproduce it below for it accurately reflects also my own views.     For those who have not read Russell, here is a brief bio, excerpted from  urlLink this site :   Bertrand Arthur William Russell (b.1872 - d.1970) was a British philosopher, logician, essayist, and social critic, best known for his work in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. His most influential contributions include his defense of logicism (the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic), and his theories of definite descriptions and logical atomism. Along with G.E. Moore, Russell is generally recognized as one of the founders of analytic philosophy. Along with Kurt Gödel, he is also regularly credited with being one of the two most important logicians of the twentieth century.  Over the course of his long career, Russell made significant contributions, not just to logic and philosophy, but to a broad range of other subjects including education, history, political theory and religious studies. In addition, many of his writings on a wide variety of topics in both the sciences and the humanities have influenced generations of general readers. After a life marked by controversy (including dismissals from both Trinity College, Cambridge, and City College, New York), Russell was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Also noted for his many spirited anti-war and anti-nuclear protests, Russell remained a prominent public figure until his death at the age of 97.  After the following essay, you can have a look at some of Russell's other writings on theology, found online  urlLink here . My favorite essay of his, found in a  urlLink book by the same name , is "Why I am not a Christian."    What is an Agnostic?  By Bertrand Russell   What Is an agnostic?  An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.   Are agnostics atheists?  No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial. At the same time, an Agnostic may hold that the existence of God, though not impossible, is very improbable; he may even hold it so improbable that it is not worth considering in practice. In that case, he is not far removed from atheism. His attitude may be that which a careful philosopher would have towards the gods of ancient Greece. If I were asked to prove that Zeus and Poseidon and Hera and the rest of the Olympians do not exist, I should be at a loss to find conclusive arguments. An Agnostic may think the Christian God as improbable as the Olympians; in that case, he is, for practical purposes, at one with the atheists.   Since you deny `God's Law', what authority do you accept as a guide to conduct?  An Agnostic does not accept any `authority' in the sense in which religious people do. He holds that a man should think out questions of conduct for himself. Of course, he will seek to profit by the wisdom of others, but he will have to select for himself the people he is to consider wise, and he will not regard even what they say as unquestionable. He will observe that what passes as `God's law' varies from time to time. The Bible says both that a woman must not marry her deceased husband's brother, and that, in certain circumstances, she must do so. If you have the misfortune to be a childless widow with an unmarried brother-in-law, it is logically impossible for you to avoid disobeying `God's law'.   How do you know what is good and what is evil? What does an agnostic consider a sin?  The Agnostic is not quite so certain as some Christians are as to what is good and what is evil. He does not hold, as most Christians in the past held, that people who disagree with the government on abstruse points of theology ought to suffer a painful death. He is against persecution, and rather chary of moral condemnation.  As for `sin', he thinks it not a useful notion. He admits, of course, that some kinds of conduct are desirable and some undesirable, but he holds that the punishment of undesirable kinds is only to be commended when it is deterrent or reformatory, not when it is inflicted because it is thought a good thing on its own account that the wicked should suffer. It was this belief in vindictive punishment that made men accept Hell. This is part of the harm done by the notion of `sin'.   Does an agnostic do whatever he pleases?  In one sense, no; in another sense, everyone does whatever he pleases. Suppose, for example, you hate someone so much that you would like to murder him. Why do you not do so? You may reply: "Because religion tells me that murder is a sin." But as a statistical fact, agnostics are not more prone to murder than other people, in fact, rather less so. They have the same motives for abstaining from murder as other people have. Far and away the most powerful of these motives is the fear of punishment. In lawless conditions, such as a gold rush, all sorts of people will commit crimes, although in ordinary circumstances they would have been law-abiding. There is not only actual legal punishment; there is the discomfort of dreading discovery, and the loneliness of knowing that, to avoid being hated, you must wear a mask with even your closest intimates. And there is also what may be called "conscience": If you ever contemplated a murder, you would dread the horrible memory of your victim's last moments or lifeless corpse. All this, it is true, depends upon your living in a law-abiding community, but there are abundant secular reasons for creating and preserving such a community.  I said that there is another sense in which every man does as he pleases. No one but a fool indulges every impulse, but what holds a desire in check is always some other desire. A man's anti-social wishes may be restrained by a wish to please God, but they may also be restrained by a wish to please his friends, or to win the respect of his community, or to be able to contemplate himself without disgust. But if he has no such wishes, the mere abstract concepts of morality will not keep him straight.   How does an agnostic regard the Bible?  An agnostic regards the Bible exactly as enlightened clerics regard it. He does not think that it is divinely inspired; he thinks its early history legendary, and no more exactly true than that in Homer; he thinks its moral teaching sometimes good, but sometimes very bad. For example: Samuel ordered Saul, in a war, to kill not only every man, woman, and child of the enemy, but also all the sheep and cattle. Saul, however, let the sheep and the cattle live, and for this we are told to condemn him. I have never been able to admire Elisha for cursing the children who laughed at him, or to believe (what the Bible asserts) that a benevolent Deity would send two she-bears to kill the children.   How does an agnostic regard Jesus, the Virgin Birth, and the Holy Trinity?  Since an agnostic does not believe in God, he cannot think that Jesus was God. Most agnostics admire the life and moral teachings of Jesus as told in the Gospels, but not necessarily more than those of certain other men. Some would place him on a level with Buddha, some with Socrates and some with Abraham Lincoln. Nor do they think that what He said is not open to question, since they do not accept any authority as absolute.  They regard the Virgin Birth as a doctrine taken over from pagan mythology, where such births were not uncommon. (Zoroaster was said to have been born of a virgin; Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess, is called the Holy Virgin.) They cannot give credence to it, or to the doctrine of the Trinity, since neither is possible without belief in God.   Can an agnostic be a Christian?  The word "Christian" has had various different meanings at different times. Throughout most of the centuries since the time of Christ, it has meant a person who believed God and immortality and held that Christ was God. But Unitarians call themselves Christians, although they do not believe in the divinity of Christ, and many people nowadays use the word "God" in a much less precise sense than that which it used to bear. Many people who say they believe in God no longer mean a person, or a trinity of persons, but only a vague tendency or power or purpose immanent in evolution. Others, going still further, mean by "Christianity" merely a system of ethics which, since they are ignorant of history, they imagine to be characteristic of Christians only.  When, in a recent book, I said that what the world needs is "love, Christian love, or compassion," many people thought this showed some changes in my views, although in fact, I might have said the same thing at any time. If you mean by a "Christian" a man who loves his neighbor, who has wide sympathy with suffering, and who ardently desires a world freed from the cruelties and abominations which at present disfigure it, then, certainly, you will be justified in calling me a Christian. And, in this sense, I think you will find more "Christians" among agnostics than among the orthodox. But, for my part, I cannot accept such a definition. Apart from other objections to it, it seems rude to Jews, Buddhists, Mohammedans, and other non-Christians, who, so far as history shows, have been at least as apt as Christians to practice the virtues which some modern Christians arrogantly claim as distinctive of their own religion.  I think also that all who called themselves Christians in an earlier time, and a great majority of those who do so at the present day, would consider that belief in God and immortality is essential to a Christian. On these grounds, I should not call myself a Christian, and I should say that an agnostic cannot be a Christian. But, if the word "Christianity" comes to be generally used to mean merely a kind of morality, then it will certainly be possible for an agnostic to be a Christian.   Does an agnostic deny that man has a soul?  This question has no precise meaning unless we are given a definition of the word "soul." I suppose what is meant is, roughly, something nonmaterial which persists throughout a person's life and even, for those who believe in immortality, throughout all future time. If this is what is meant, an agnostic is not likely to believe that man has a soul. But I must hasten to add that this does not mean that an agnostic must be a materialist. Many agnostics (including myself) are quite as doubtful of the body as they are of the soul, but this is a long story taking one into difficult metaphysics. Mind and matter alike, I should say, are only convenient symbols in discourse, not actually existing things.   Does an agnostic believe in a hereafter, in Heaven or Hell?  The question whether people survive death is one as to which evidence is possible. Psychical research and spiritualism are thought by many to supply such evidence. An agnostic, as such, does not take a view about survival unless he thinks that there is evidence one way or the other. For my part, I do not think there is any good reason to believe that we survive death, but I am open to conviction if adequate evidence should appear.  Heaven and hell are a different matter. Belief in hell is bound up with the belief that the vindictive punishment of sin is a good thing, quite independently of any reformative or deterrent effect that it may have. Hardly an agnostic believes this. As for heaven, there might conceivably someday be evidence of its existence through spiritualism, but most agnostics do not think that there is such evidence, and therefore do not believe in heaven.   Are you never afraid of God's judgment in denying Him?  Most certainly not. I also deny Zeus and Jupiter and Odin and Brahma, but this causes me no qualms. I observe that a very large portion of the human race does not believe in God and suffers no visible punishment in consequence. And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence.   How do agnostics explain the beauty and harmony of nature?  I do not understand where this "beauty" and "harmony" are supposed to be found. Throughout the animal kingdom, animals ruthlessly prey upon each other. Most of them are either cruelly killed by other animals or slowly die of hunger. For my part, I am unable to see any great beauty or harmony in the tapeworm. Let it not be said that this creature is sent as a punishment for our sins, for it is more prevalent among animals than among humans. I suppose the questioner is thinking of such things as the beauty of the starry heavens. But one should remember that stars every now and again explode and reduce everything in their neighborhood to a vague mist. Beauty, in any case, is subjective and exists only in the eye of the beholder.   How do agnostics explain miracles and other revelations of God's omnipotence?  Agnostics do not think that there is any evidence of "miracles" in the sense of happenings contrary to natural law. We know that faith healing occurs and is in no sense miraculous. At Lourdes, certain diseases can be cured and others cannot. Those that can be cured at Lourdes can probably be cured by any doctor in whom the patient has faith. As for the records of other miracles, such as Joshua commanding the sun to stand still, the agnostic dismisses them as legends and points to the fact that all religions are plentifully supplied with such legends. There is just as much miraculous evidence for the Greek gods in Homer as for the Christian God in the Bible.   There have been base and cruel passions, which religion opposes. If you abandon religious principles, could mankind exist?  The existence of base and cruel passions is undeniable, but I find no evidence in history that religion has opposed these passions. On the contrary, it has sanctified them, and enabled people to indulge them without remorse. Cruel persecutions have been commoner in Christendom than anywhere else. What appears to justify persecution is dogmatic belief. Kindliness and tolerance only prevail in proportion as dogmatic belief decays. In our day, a new dogmatic religion, namely, communism, has arisen. To this, as to other systems of dogma, the agnostic is opposed. The persecuting character of present day communism is exactly like the persecuting character of Christianity in earlier centuries. In so far as Christianity has become less persecuting, this is mainly due to the work of freethinkers who have made dogmatists rather less dogmatic. If they were as dogmatic now as in former times, they would still think it right to burn heretics at the stake. The spirit of tolerance which some modern Christians regard as essentially Christian is, in fact, a product of the temper which allows doubt and is suspicious of absolute certainties. I think that anybody who surveys past history in an impartial manner will be driven to the conclusion that religion has caused more suffering than it has prevented.   What is the meaning of life to the agnostic?  I feel inclined to answer by another question: What is the meaning of `the meaning of life'? I suppose what is intended is some general purpose. I do not think that life in general has any purpose. It just happened. But individual human beings have purposes, and there is nothing in agnosticism to cause them to abandon these purposes. They cannot, of course, be certain of achieving the results at which they aim; but you would think ill of a soldier who refused to fight unless victory was certain. The person who needs religion to bolster up his own purposes is a timorous person, and I cannot think as well of him as of the man who takes his chances, while admitting that defeat is not impossible.   Does not the denial of religion mean the denial of marriage and chastity?  Here again, one must reply by another question: Does the man who asks this question believe that marriage and chastity contribute to earthly happiness here below, or does he think that, while they cause misery here below, they are to be advocated as means of getting to heaven? The man who takes the latter view will no doubt expect agnosticism to lead to a decay of what he calls virtue, but he will have to admit that what he calls virtue is not what ministers to the happiness of the human race while on earth. If, on the other hand, he takes the former view, namely, that there are terrestrial arguments in favor of marriage and chastity, he must also hold that these arguments are such as should appeal to the agnostic. Agnostics, as such, have no distinctive views about sexual morality. But most of them would admit that there are valid arguments against the unbridled indulgence of sexual desires. They would derive these arguments, however, from terrestrial sources and not from supposed divine commands.   Is not faith in reason alone a dangerous creed? Is not reason imperfect and inadequate without spiritual and moral law?  No sensible man, however agnostic, has "faith in reason alone." Reason is concerned with matters of fact, some observed, some inferred. The question whether there is a future life and the question whether there is a God concern matters of fact, and the agnostic will hold that they should be investigated in the same way as the question, "Will there be an eclipse of the moon tomorrow?" But matters of fact alone are not sufficient to determine action, since they do not tell us what ends we ought to pursue. In the realm of ends, we need something other than reason. The agnostic will find his ends in his own heart and not in an external command. Let us take an illustration: Suppose you wish to travel by train from New York to Chicago; you will use reason to discover when the trains run, and a person who though that there was some faculty of insight or intuition enabling him to dispense with the timetable would be thought rather silly. But no timetable will tell him that it is wise, he will have to take account of further matters of fact; but behind all the matters of fact, there will be the ends that he thinks fitting to pursue, and these, for an agnostic as for other men, belong to a realm which is not that of reason, though it should be in no degree contrary to it. The realm I mean is that of emotion and feeling and desire.   Do you regard all religions as forms of superstition or dogma? Which of the existing religions do you most respect, and why?  All the great organized religions that have dominated large populations have involved a greater or less amount of dogma, but "religion" is a word of which the meaning is not very definite. Confucianism, for instance, might be called a religion, although it involves no dogma. And in some forms of liberal Christianity, the element of dogma is reduced to a minimum.  Of the great religions of history, I prefer Buddhism, especially in its earliest forms, because it has had the smallest element of persecution.   Communism like agnosticism opposes religion, are agnostics Communists?  Communism does not oppose religion. It merely opposes the Christian religion, just as Mohammedanism does. Communism, at least in the form advocated by the Soviet Government and the Communist Party, is a new system of dogma of a peculiarly virulent and persecuting sort. Every genuine Agnostic must therefore be opposed to it.   Do agnostics think that science and religion are impossible to reconcile?  The answer turns upon what is meant by `religion'. If it means merely a system of ethics, it can be reconciled with science. If it means a system of dogma, regarded as unquestionably true, it is incompatible with the scientific spirit, which refuses to accept matters of fact without evidence, and also holds that complete certainty is hardly ever impossible.   What kind of evidence could convince you that God exists?  I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence. I can imagine other evidence of the same sort which might convince me, but so far as I know, no such evidence exists.

         Some in Britain are pushing for restriction of abortion because, in part, of new technology that has given us a clearer picture of the unborn child. Take a look at  urlLink this article  for the full details, whence comes this excerpt: One reason for the new push against abortion is powerful 3D images that are now possible with the latest in ultrasound technology. It produces pictures from the womb in more detail than ever before — moving, yawning, even appearing to smile.  If a woman still decides to have an abortion after seeing such vivid images she may not be fit to be a mother, pro-life activists contend. Abortion rights groups say hype over the new ultrasound shouldn't shock the government into change.  Thanks to  urlLink Michael  for the source.

      The Pope just released a 13-page  urlLink letter  on feminism. The following are excerpts: Recent years have seen new approaches to women's issues. A first tendency is to emphasize strongly conditions of subordination in order to give rise to antagonism: women, in order to be themselves, must make themselves the adversaries of men. Faced with the abuse of power, the answer for women is to seek power. This process leads to opposition between men and women, in which the identity and role of one are emphasized to the disadvantage of the other, leading to harmful confusion regarding the human person, which has its most immediate and lethal effects in the structure of the family.  [...]  Formed by God and placed in the garden which he was to cultivate, the man, who is still referred to with the generic expression  Adam , experienced a loneliness which the presence of the animals is not able to overcome. He needs a  helpmate  who will be his partner. The term here does not refer to an inferior, but to a vital helper. This is so that  Adam's  life does not sink into a sterile and, in the end, baneful encounter with himself. It is necessary that he enter into relationship with another being on his own level. Only the woman, created from the same “flesh” and cloaked in the same mystery, can give a future to the life of the man. It is therefore above all on the ontological level that this takes place, in the sense that God's creation of woman characterizes humanity as a relational reality. In this encounter, the man speaks words for the first time, expressive of his wonderment: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.”   [...]  Among the fundamental values linked to women's actual lives is what has been called a “capacity for the other”. Although a certain type of feminist rhetoric makes demands “for ourselves”, women preserve the deep intuition of the goodness in their lives of those actions which elicit life, and contribute to the growth and protection of the other.  This intuition is linked to women's physical capacity to give life. Whether lived out or remaining potential, this capacity is a reality that structures the female personality in a profound way. It allows her to acquire maturity very quickly, and gives a sense of the seriousness of life and of its responsibilities. A sense and a respect for what is concrete develop in her, opposed to abstractions which are so often fatal for the existence of individuals and society. It is women, in the end, who even in very desperate situations, as attested by history past and present, possess a singular capacity to persevere in adversity, to keep life going even in extreme situations, to hold tenaciously to the future, and finally to remember with tears the value of every human life.

         I just read a very good and thorough review of the Placebo Effect in an article from the NYT Magazine published in 2000. Here is a  urlLink web site on the same topic , with a list of additional articles at its end. Here is the  urlLink original article . What is this all about, you ask? Just read the first of the following paragraphs. Forty years ago, a young Seattle cardiologist named Leonard Cobb conducted a unique trial of a procedure then commonly used for angina, in which doctors made small incisions in the chest and tied knots in two arteries to try to increase blood flow to the heart. It was a popular technique -- 90 percent of patients reported that it helped -- but when Cobb compared it with placebo surgery in which he made incisions but did not tie off the arteries, the sham operations proved just as successful. The procedure, known as internal mammary ligation, was soon abandoned.   [...]  The truth is that the placebo effect is huge -- anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of patients benefit from taking a dummy pill in studies of new drugs -- so huge, in fact, that it should probably be put to conscious use in clinical practice, even if we do not entirely understand how it works. For centuries, Western medicine consisted of almost nothing but the placebo effect. The patient who got better after a bleeding -- or a dose of fox lung, wood lice, tartar emetic or any of the other charming staples of the 19th-century pharmacopoeia -- got better either in spite of them or because of their symbolic value. Such patients believed in the cure and in the authority of the bewigged gentlemen administering it, and the belief gave them hope and the hope helped make them well. There were exceptions -- remedies, like quinine for malaria, the vaccine for smallpox and morphine for pain relief, that actually worked. But generally speaking, if all the drugs of the day "could be sunk to the bottom of the sea," as Oliver Wendell Holmes observed in 1860, "it would be all the better for mankind -- and all the worse for the fishes."   In the postwar era, with the triumph of the biomedical model and the proliferation of drugs and techniques that did successfully extend life, many doctors would just as soon have forgotten about the placebo effect altogether. They now had proven remedies and methods: antibiotics for infection; dazzling surgical techniques like heart and liver transplantation; sophisticated diagnostic tools like magnetic resonance imaging. In fact, medical science has improved so much and so fast in the last 40 years that it is easy, perhaps, for doctors to neglect the part of medicine that is not science at all. The ready and lavish display of sympathy, the laying on of hands, the projection of a slightly mystical authority -- these are now more often the province of alternative medical practitioners, who have no compunction about manipulating them. In a recent edition of a British medical journal, a general practitioner wondered whether he ought to give an 86-year-old patient a pharmacologically useless "tonic" she had requested in fond remembrance of the ones her old doctor had given her. "I don't use tonics routinely anymore," he wrote, "but perhaps I should: they are pharmacologically pretty harmless and cheap to boot. Homeopathy, herbs and talkative middle-aged ladies who squeeze your feet have replaced them, but because I do not offer these alternative medicines, my patients go elsewhere for their magic, hope and comfort."   But what if doctors firmly in the fold of evidence-based medicine were not so circumspect about offering magic, hope and comfort? What if they did resort more often to tonics or their equivalent -- to the old-fashioned squeezing of the hand and the slightly unrealistic imparting of hope that is now frowned upon as a bit too authoritarian and paternalistic? What if they started thinking of placebos as a way of bridging the gap between the magnificent but sometimes cold efficiency of modern American medicine and the unproven but evidently comforting remedies prescribed by homeopaths and herbalists? After all, more and more people seem to be drawn to alternative medical therapies -- half of all Americans say they have tried them -- despite a distinct lack of empirical proof for their effectiveness. Yet people may actually harm themselves if they down the latest untested herbal panacea, while if they take an inert substance (or get a cheering speech) given by a conventional physician, they will do no worse and they stand a good statistical chance of doing better. There is something to be said, surely, for a little benign deception.  [...]  Sometimes our contemporary notions of informed consent, important though they are, interfere with a doctor's capacity to offer hope and comfort. "When, for example, a patient who is about to undergo a straightforward surgical procedure anxiously asks the surgeon, 'Doctor, am I going to make it?' what should the surgeon say?" asks Walter Brown. "Traditionally, the response would be to encourage the patient: 'You're in good hands here, everything will be fine.' Yet I have posed this scenario to a variety of physicians, both residents and attendings, and found that some consider themselves obligated to list the possible complications and the risk of death, even if the mortality rate from the procedure is minuscule."   Medical training that (rightly) values precise expression and a culture that values full disclosure and protection from liability may spur doctors to tell their patients the uninflected and deflating truth even in the most dire circumstances. But surely telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth is not the most humane or practical of counsels for doctors. Someone I know of, a physician herself, was recently operated on for a brain tumor. Her doctor chose his first postop visit to her in the hospital to tell her she would never work again. It didn't help her recovery much.  [...]  In 1980, The New England Journal of Medicine published an eloquent essay by its former editor Franz Ingelfinger, in which he argued that though arrogance was usually a pejorative word, doctors could exercise it in a way that was humane and salutary. If arrogance meant "insolence, vanity, arbitrariness or lack of empathy," it was worthless or worse to a patient. But if it meant the confidence some physicians conveyed in their own advice, then it was a gift to the sick, who are often frightened and, in their fear, a little childlike. Ingelfinger came to this belief when he himself was ill. He had developed cancer of the esophagus, the very organ he had spent much of his professional life studying, and had to decide whether to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy. From his friends and colleagues across the country, contradictory suggestions poured in. "As a result," Ingelfinger recalled, "not only I but my wife, my son and daughter-in-law (both doctors), and other family members became increasingly confused and emotionally distraught. Finally, when the pangs of indecision had become nearly intolerable, one wise physician friend said, 'What you need is a doctor.' He was telling me to forget the information I already had and the information I was receiving from many quarters, and to seek instead a person who would dominate, who would tell me what to do." When he found that person, Ingelfinger felt an "immediate and immense relief."   Is it possible to stimulate a placebo response without dispensing a placebo? Almost certainly. Intuitive -- and benignly arrogant -- doctors have been doing it for years. And why shouldn't they? After all, placebo therapy, if you want to call it that, is safe, cheap and particularly useful for the "worried well" -- patients who feel ill but have no organic disease and who account for so many visits to the doctor's office. "If you can create a more effective healing practice based on the manipulation of meaning, then you're going to heal more people," says Daniel Moerman. "Is it some sort of failure if it isn't due to a pill? The important thing is you've made somebody better."

         By Hugh Levinson  BBC Current Affairs    Few foreigners get close to Kim Jong-il, the reclusive North Korean leader.  But one Italian chef got close enough to make his pizza.   The call came in the middle of the night, just as Ermanno Furlanis, a computer expert and part-time chef at the Pizza Institute in northern Italy, was trying to get to sleep.   The call came from a top chef at a swanky hotel. He had been contacted by some foreign diplomats who wanted experts for culinary demonstrations "in a communist country in the Far East".   That country was North Korea.   It was the start of a bizarre adventure into the corridors and kitchens of power, which Mr Furlanis has recounted for a BBC Radio 3 documentary.   A few days after the call, he found himself and a group of fellow chefs on their way to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.   He was whisked through the city to a gleaming, empty clinic, for a complete medical check-up. They conducted X-rays, an electrocardiogram and a brain scan, and took magnetic resonance imaging, urine samples and a sizeable blood sample.   "I was by now worried out of my mind," said Mr Furlanis. "Here was proof that we were completely in their power, and they could do with us as they pleased."   They were sequestered in a vast, white marble palace, before being told to prepare for a trip to "a place at the seaside".    Hidden famine    During this period, in the late 1990s, North Korea was going through a severe famine in which an unknown number of people died of malnutrition. All of this was concealed from Mr Furlanis - apart from some glimpses during his car journey out of Pyongyang.   "The countryside was poor and backward-looking," he said. "Extensive areas were under cultivation and the buildings looked impoverished and abandoned."   The destination turned out to be a military base, protected by four layers of barbed wire and guards, and surrounded by heavy anti-aircraft guns.   There, Mr Furlanis discovered that his task was to teach pizza-making skills to three army officers, who took the job remarkably seriously.   "While I worked, my pupils, pen and notebook in hand, took down every detail while the rest of the staff, a dozen people or so, gathered round to watch the proceedings in an absorbed silence."   Mr Furlanis said that one of the students even asked to count the olives he used and to measure the distance between them.   "I don't know if he was just pulling my leg, but he looked totally serious," he said.   After several days of tuition came the climax of the adventure - a trip to a huge ship anchored offshore. The North Korean staff had moved Mr Furlanis' entire pizzeria to a pontoon raft moored alongside the ship, where he started to work.   Suddenly, there was huge agitation on board. Crossing the gangplank to the ship was - apparently - Kim Jong-il himself.   "I am not in the position to say whether it really was him," said Mr Furlanis, "but our chef, who had no reason to fib, was, for the space of several minutes, utterly speechless.   "He said he felt as if he had seen God, and I still envy him this experience."    I made pizza for Kim Jong-il can be heard at 22.40, 14th August, on  urlLink BBC Radio 3    ( urlLink source )   I also refer the reader to  urlLink a sampling of Kim Jong-il's instant messenger conversations . I hope all of you will join me in listening to this program. According to my calculations, it will be at 5:40 p.m. New York time this Saturday. You will be able to  urlLink listen live  over the internet.

       The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1-1/2 percent.   The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  [...]  The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.   Go ahead and pretend you understand that.  ( urlLink source )

      1. God had only one major publication.  2. It was in Hebrew.  3. It had no references.  4. It wasn't published in a refereed journal.  5. Some even doubt God wrote it alone.  6. It may be true that God created the world, but what has God done since then?  7. God's cooperative efforts have been quite limited.  8. The scientific community has had a hard time replicating God's results.  9. God never applied to the Ethics Board for permission to use human subjects.  10. When one experiment went awry God tried to cover it up by drowning the subjects.  11. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, God deleted them from the sample.  12. God rarely came to class, just told students to read the Book.  13. God expelled the first two students for learning.  14. Although there were only ten requirements, most students failed God's tests.  15. God's office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top.

      Mon Aug 9, 7:58 AM ET  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A chain of private California schools that taught immigrants there are 53 U.S. states and four branches of the U.S. government was ordered to stop handing out phony diplomas this week, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said on Friday.      Authorities seized the assets of California Alternative High School and asked a judge to stop the company's 30 schools statewide from handing out "high school diplomas" to students dreaming of a better life through education, Lockyer said.   The company charged its mainly Latino students $450 to $1,450 for a 10-week course based on a 54-page book that was riddled with errors, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday.   Students learned that Congress had two houses -- the Senate for Democrats and the House for Republicans; that the U.S. flag had not been updated to reflect the addition of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the "original" 50 states; that the federal "administrative" branch oversees the Treasury Department; and that World War II occurred from 1938 to 1942.   There are 50 U.S. states, including Alaska and Hawaii, who are represented on the U.S. flag. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, not a state. There is no "administrative" branch of the U.S. government. The three branches are judicial, executive and legislative. World War II was fought between 1939 and 1945, although the United States did not enter the war until 1941.   The workbook also refers to the play, "Death of a Traveling Salesman," not Arthur Miller's classic "Death of a Salesman."   The company claimed to have 78 locations nationwide and said it was actively expanding operations despite court orders in two other states that sought to block it from claiming the diplomas were "official," Lockyer said.

      Danielle Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote  urlLink an editorial in the NYT , whence come these excerpts:  The initial reviews of the current President Bush's push for reform in the Middle East may have been harsh, especially from the region's entrenched powers. Yet in the last few months, the debate, once confined to émigré papers published in London or Paris, has suddenly bubbled up onto the pages of the state-controlled press in the Arab world.   And what about the argument that democracy can't be "imposed" from the outside? That counsel of despair was knocked out of the park by the Palestinian scholar Daoud Kuttab, who wrote in the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat that "Arab democrats have failed to reach their goals through their own efforts" and should welcome support from outside "irrespective of the messenger." Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian Nobel laureate, went even further in Al Ahram, Egypt's main daily newspaper, warning that postponing reform would be "playing with fire."  Mr. Kerry and his surrogates, meanwhile, worry about change that comes "too quickly" and breeds "violence and repression," in the words of an old Kerry hand from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jonathan Winer.   Arab democrats and their supporters abroad, however, might respond that the Arab world is hardly short of violence and repression as things now stand, and change that comes too slowly might prove the biggest danger. Indeed, the fruits of "stability" are hard to find in the latest Arab Human Development Report issued by the United Nations Development Program. It describes the Arab Middle East and North Africa as the least politically free region of the world. It also describes a region where 65 million adults are illiterate, almost two-thirds of them women, and where one in five citizens lives on less than $2 a day.  [...]  [M]ake no mistake, [Bush] has made headway. Notwithstanding the administration's modest approach, democracy is now at the center of debate in Arab capitals. And while some in the United States continue to insist that Arab democracy is the fantasy of a discredited cabal in Washington, an effort to avoid what they assert should be America's only priority - resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - Arab intellectuals don't necessarily agree. The director of Egypt's Al Ahram center for Political and Strategic Studies, Abdel Monem Said, took the issue on himself. "Making reform and human rights contingent upon resolving the Palestinian problem," he said, "confirms what the American neo-cons are saying, that the political regimes harming human rights are using the Palestinian problem in order to divert glances from their own behavior."  It's not 1989 in the Middle East, and a series of velvet revolutions aren't on tap for the immediate future. But the intellectual firepower that underlies any such revolution is growing; the region is in the throes of genuine pro-democratic ferment. And governments have taken note, admittedly in their own half-hearted fashion. The Arab League has embraced a series of self-serving reforms; the Saudis have announced plans for municipal elections starting in November; and the Bahrainis and Qataris are making real changes to their political systems.

      I had been waiting for many weeks for an article called "Foundations of a Jewish Economic Theory" by Yosef Lifshitz in the  urlLink Azure  journal to be released in English. I first read about the Hebrew version of this article, which was published earlier in a different journal, in this  urlLink Ha'aretz article , which is a place to start if you only want a summary. The author writes about the supposed link between Judaism and socialism; his perspective is that Jewish tradition provides much more support for free markets than for socialism. Here are links to the Azure article: ( urlLink HTML ) ( urlLink PDF ). The following is an excerpt:  This tendency to identify Judaism with the aims of socialism is not new. In the nineteenth century, Jewish thinkers found in this activist and anticlerical movement the raw material for the forging of a new, modern Jewish identity. “Judaism—any trace of haughtiness or aristocracy is foreign to it,” wrote Moses Hess in 1862. “The Jewish spirit is a social-democratic spirit down to its very essence.” Judaism was depicted by many as a synonym for social justice and equality, and the Jews—no strangers to suffering—as the natural bearers of the torch of social reform. As the Labor Zionist leader Chaim Arlosoroff explained in 1916, “The folk socialism of the Jews, the noble spirit of the history of our people, the rule of the ideas of justice and human liberty in the spiritual development of Judaism, the spiritual quality which the Jews acquired over generations, their cultural consciousness and lofty aspiration for freedom—all these empower them to lead the fight for idealistic socialism.” It is no surprise, then, that the struggle for economic equality became a central pillar of the new Jewish state’s worldview, finding expression in severe limitations and regulations in the sphere of private ownership, on the one hand, and heavy taxation—the lifeblood of the new social order—on the other.  [...]  [I]t is difficult to ignore the fact that the most notable antecedents for these socialist ideas appear not in the Jewish sources, but in the doctrines of the very Catholic Church against which socialism had originally sought to array itself. The Church Fathers had a clear view of man’s place in the world, according to which the individual’s accumulation of wealth was seen as a form of injustice, and his rights to property were clearly limited by the needs of the poor. In the classical Christian view, man should not keep more than he needs to live modestly, and property should be made available to the needy, even in contravention of the owner’s wishes.  Jewish tradition, in contrast, takes a positive view of both the institution of ownership and the accumulation of wealth. It respects economic success, seeing it as both a blessing and the basis of normative life on earth—so long, that is, as it is obtained honestly, and proper respect is shown for the social responsibility that accompanies it. In what follows, I will explore the basic tenets of a Jewish economics, and will make in this context the following three arguments: (i) As opposed to the classical Christian view, which extols self-denial and opposes the accumulation of private wealth, Judaism presents a contrary ideal, according to which man must exert control over the material in order to realize his divine potential as having been created “in God’s image”; (ii) this view is reflected in the Jewish approach to property, according to which the right of individual ownership and the accumulation of wealth is seen as a means of fulfilling man’s responsibility in the world; and (iii) the obligation to care for the poor stems from this same sense of responsibility, and is expressed through the act of tzedaka, or charity, in which the individual voluntarily gives away the fruits of his labor out of concern for his fellow man. The Jewish concept of charitable giving does not impinge on property rights, but rather expresses the individual’s moral duty as a responsible person—a strong and productive individual who provides for himself and his family through honest means, on the one hand, and gives of his time and money out of generosity and a sense of concern, on the other. Charity, in the Jewish view, thus suggests an ideal that differs sharply from that of classical Christianity, one which flows from a radically different view of man’s place in the world and what it means to have been created in God’s image.

      Yesterday I received a piece of fan mail. But before I share it, a little background: Last month, on the  urlLink Orkut  community " urlLink The Roman Republic ," I started  urlLink a discussion , the first part of which I have reproduced below:    Pax Americana     Andrew  7/16/2004 10:04 AM I would join this group, except part of your description--"the greatest empire the world has ever known"--is inaccurate. We must rememberer that Pax Americana is the status of the world today, and it is much more thorough than the Pax Romana in every way--culturally, economically, militarily. For example, is it conceivable that Rome could have conquered a country the size of Iraq on the opposite side of the globe in a few weeks? Though Rome had more explicit control over its domain, it seems to me that America's power, though often implicit, is much greater.   Liz     7/16/2004 7:14 PM I think Rome counts as the greatest empire when you consider what it had to work with. Specifically, conquering large portions of the world without modern military technology, and spreading Roman culture throughout the empire without modern media.  Not to mention inventing a lot of things basically from scratch. "What did the Romans ever do for us? Except for the roads, and the aqueducts, and the representative government, and the alphabet." :)         Andrew     7/16/2004 7:30 PM Except that the first road was the Persian Royal Road (in use from 3500 BC); qanat systems were in use in ancient Persia, India, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern countries hundreds of years before the Romans built their aqueducts; the word democracy originates from the Greek "demos" meaning "the people" and "kratein" meaning "to rule" or, literally: "the people to rule", which means "Rule by the People"--again far earlier than the Romans; and the first alphabet that has been recovered was developed in central Egypt around 2000 BC.   The Romans' greatness was not in originality or innovation; rather, it was in organization.      Liz     7/16/2004 11:31 PM True, but they organized all of those things into the form we still use today, which is pretty impressive.  And I think my first point, about considering what they had to work with, still stands ...         Andrew     7/17/2004 12:12 AM The Romans did have less to work with, but I'm not sure that technological prowess aught to be taken into account. After all, some cave man probably had an even "greater" empire if you take into account that he only had a club for a weapon and grunts for a language. So, it seems to me, that greatness is an absolute thing. And, thus, I maintain that the United States are greater than the SPQR.       Guido     7/17/2004 2:14 AM Pax Americana? Caesar Augustus must be laughing his imperial head off :) Without even mentioning that US have troops engaged all around the world, which conflicts slightly with the notion of peace, the difference is that Rome gave it's laws to its subjected countries and imposed its governors to rule in its name. US gave the Big Mac recipe and has no real control over the "provinciae".      Andrew     7/17/2004 2:28 PM Just like Rome fought a number of wars during the Pax Romana (including those against the the Germanic tribes and Parthia), so the United States uses its army to continue the general state of peace in the world that it has effected since World War II. (Obviously "Pax" does not mean absolute peace; rather, it means a state more peaceful than the world is used to.) And "Pax Americana" is a fairly standard term; see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana   The last post on this topic was some time ago, and I had forgotten it. But yesterday I got a letter that resurrected this topic in my mind. It reads as follows (the sender's identity has been withheld):  Date: Sun, 08 Aug 2004 20:35:08 Subject: I hate subject lines  To: Andrew Moroz     Because they always make me condense things, which I'm lousy at anyway. I read your posts in the Roman Republic community on pax americana, pax romana, etc and I think you're full of shit.  By the way, do you want to do me?  I must say that this provided me quite a bit of entertainment tonight. And in the spirit of sharing Jove's presence, I'd like to reveal some bits from her profile--after all, it's not every day that I am simultaneously told that I am "full of shit" and sexually solicited; one or the other: yes, frequently; but both?--a rarity.   about me:  I'm much too obvious for my own good.   age:  19   humor:  campy/cheesy, dry/sarcastic, clever/quick witted, obscure   fashion:  classic, smart, trendy   passions:  eating, cooking and talking about food, arguing, yaoi, Roman civilization, amateur archaeology, sleeping, reading, dwatching nip/tuck   sports:  swimming, hiking, canoeing, kayaking   activities:  reading, cooking, working, watching old anime, anticipating the start of classes, sewing   books:  laughter in the dark(nabokov), the key(tanizaki), anything at all by funny englishmen, naomi(tanizaki), a moveable feast(hemingway), any short stories by jun'ichiro tanizaki, haruki murakami or annie proulx, and more I cant remember   music:  cake, momus, rasputina, tom waits, radiohead, magnetic fields, cafe tacuba, mana, david bowie, belle and sebastien, outkast, bonnie prince billie, the old 97's   tv shows:  PGSM, jungle wa itsumo Hale nochi guu, Plantes, digi charat, Full Metal Alchemist(kind of), Guiding Light, Nip/Tuck, the Ali G show   movies:  les triplettes de belleville, lost in translation, gosford park, fahrenheit 9/11, satyricon, amarcord, 8&1/2, la dolce vita, down with love, zoolander, millenium actress, bringing up baby, shallow grave, Peter Sellers' Pink Panther movies, Some Like it Hot   major:  classics   ideal match:  Unbearably witty, confident, sexually dominant, intelligent and interested in literature, classics and/or history, perceptive, punctual, preferrably bespectacled.   turn ons:  assertiveness, dancing, flirting, intelligence, power   turn offs:  presumptuousness, lack of kissing skill, small hands, lack of manners   perfect first date:  museum, coffee, dessert; in that order.   five things i can't live without:  coffee, showers, down comforters, flip-flops or sandals, floss   in my bedroom you will find:  Clothes, empty glasses, half-read books and a bed that is only made 35% of the time.   Now, my first instinct is--well, nevermind my first instinct; my second instinct is, however, to refer her to one of my favorite Orkut communities, called " urlLink Bitch Make Me A Sandwich ."
