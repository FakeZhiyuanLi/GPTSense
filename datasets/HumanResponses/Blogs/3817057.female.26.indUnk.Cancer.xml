      I swear I can't be the only mother that wants to scream that at her kids sometimes.&nbsp; I am so tired of this.&nbsp; I can't belive this is my life on some days.&nbsp; I try to be a good mom.&nbsp; I take them to the zoo, the amusement parks....whatever.&nbsp; Doesn't matter.&nbsp; They fight, scream, whine and cry.&nbsp; All day.&nbsp; For hours.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I rub my temples because of the headaches I get.&nbsp; I think it feels like a nail going through your skull.&nbsp; My ears ring inside because of the high pitched nature of it all.&nbsp; I HATE IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love my kids.&nbsp; I can't wait until they grow up some.&nbsp; When they're teens they'll just beat each ohter up.&nbsp; At least that won't involve all the noise.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Again, I count down the time until I have to go to work.&nbsp; Oh my God....WORK!&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; I love to get out of this house.&nbsp; I would love to trade places with my husband and be gone 60+ hours a week, not have to cook, clean, care for the kids hardly ever.&nbsp; He says he knows, but he does not.&nbsp; Being a working parent truly is taking the easy way out.&nbsp; I make him pay for it, too.&nbsp; I know I shouldn't.&nbsp; I take it out on him sometimes because I am so jealous of his lifestyle.&nbsp; He just goes to work, comes home, cuts the grass once a week.&nbsp; Never has to worry about being here, getting there, cleaning up the messes, finding a sitter so you can get to work on time.&nbsp; He just lives simply.&nbsp; And he gets his dick sucked.&nbsp; To be a man.

      Jeez....do kids have to scream and cry constantly?&nbsp; God makes them cute to kkep you from beating them...that's my theory.&nbsp; My one year old has literally been crying for almost 3 hours straight.&nbsp; I've played with his toes, given him toys, given him a snack... nothing helps.&nbsp; I can't wait to go to work tonight.&nbsp; At this point I'd love to go in early.&nbsp; I haven't been on a vacation in 4 years.&nbsp; I've had two children, completed a BA and a MA, and moved three times in that time.&nbsp; I deserve it.&nbsp; We deserve it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I need time alone, sans children.&nbsp; In fact, fuck it.&nbsp; I'm going to book us a vacation right now.

      We got a puppy. He's so cute....a little black lab.  That has worms.  YUCK.  I took him to poop and there had to have been an at least three inch long worm just hanging out of his little butt.  The kids like him, which is good, but now I literally have like 5 minutes ot myself a day.  Like right now two of the boys ar fighting over legos and they dog, who has been out for less than 5 minutes, is starting to yelp.  Such is life.  I mean, such is MY life.    I swear I think I would trade places with a steel worker who has to spend 45hrs a week in the mines.  Working parents have NO idea how this is.  It is the eays way out have a fulltime job.  I work 10-12 hours a week and make good money...but I can't wait to get there somedays.  I count down the mintues.  Like today.  I work at 2 and it can't come any sooner.  I know you know what I'm talking about...admit it.  Everyone does it at one time or another.    Anyway, I've been on here too long now.  The fight is getting bloody by now I'm sure.

      I'm married.  And one of the things that is supposedly great about being married is that there are limitless sexual possibilities...  Maybe that's only for married people without kids or jobs?  I don't know.  Justin works like 60 hours a week in the Navy doing shift work and we rarely see each other.  We usually pass out so early on the one night a week we are together that we miss our chance.  Sucks. I try sometimes before he has to leave but he always says he doesn't have time...  There is never time.  Give some 5 minute dick, i don't care.  And I have so many men that would give their first born to be with me, but my husband... well, maybe he's bored of me.  That's what I say to my customers at the place I dance... "You'd get bored of me," I say.  Then they always laugh and tell me "NEVER!"  but it happens.  It is happening, has happened.  Whatever.  What to do?  I would never cheat, but the idea of just getting with somebody for a night of just plain fun isn't so bad.  It's not bad to think about it.  I guess I have pretty good sex with myself.  i use to masturbate, like 5 or six times a year.  Now it's more like once a week.  This is normal.  I suppose?  I'm 26.  I don't think I should be having to do that just yet.  I love Justin.  I love him so hard.  But after the kids go to bed tonight it will just be me and my showerhead on the pulsate setting.

      Ok.  So here it goes.  I am so tired of being oogled.  Yes, I'm a dancer and people give me money to watch me, but good God!  I mean, when I'm at the grocery store in ratty gym clothes I don't like 50 year old men  looking  at me.  Or when the AC breaks in my house I don't need the repair man shaking his head and telling me how great my shape is.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I want to buy grapes and go home. I want my house to comfortable. I don't want to deal with that all the time.  Maybe I won't cover up the pimple I have on the corner of mouth when I go out later.  That should help, right? I have three kids and the coach on my oldest's football team randomly calls my house despite that fact that not only does he know that I am married, but he is as well!  With FIVE children.  Come on.  Women don't always want men to sexualize them.  If I want to be stared at I'll dress up and try.  When I just want to be MOM I'll be wearing grey shorts and have a one year old on my hip, a three year old by my side, and a seven year old skipping in front of me.  Is there no line?  There really should be.  Ok.......I'm PMSing today, so part of the rant is that, but really....it's not.  I'm sure other women have these same thoughts.

      So I got a job teaching adjunct at a community college.  I've never taught before so I'm kind of stressing out about how I'll be able to carry on a three hour long lecture.  I worked all day today to get my syllabus done.  I'm proud of myslef.  I feel like I'm FINALLY taking a step toward my working future.  Dancing is great, but it obviously can't go on forever.  Although there is a woman I work with who is in her very late 30s and she does ok...but I think she knows that she's on her way out.  In other news, my husband and I are figthing again.  I can honestly say I've been trying to be more understanding this last week.  Today he tells me that he thinks I'm never happy.  which is so crazy.  I get stressed out by life and his job in the Navy, but I'm happy.  I think.  I mean, not all day long, everyday.....  But come on.  Who is really happy 24/7?  Not counting children or clowns, of course.  I thought I had it in me to write but I don't.  I worked really late last night and now I'm so tired.
