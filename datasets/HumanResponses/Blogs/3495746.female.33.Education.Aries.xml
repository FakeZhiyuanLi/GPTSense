      "We can give you a really good deal... if you sign up by the end of the month..." and bla bla bla. Gym reps from  urlLink fitnessfirst  are as just as pushy & pesty as those  urlLink Insurance agents and Multi-level-marketing  folks when it comes to business -  urlLink I'm sick and tired of them! .   The latest deal offered to me now is part of the Maxis corporate deal, which was better than the IBM one which was offered to me yesterday. I'm two minds about this whole thing, and it seems like the reps are trying to undercut each other all the time. I have 3 reps calling me (one from uptown, and another from KLCC and one more from God-knows-where!).   I already have a lifetime gym membership with martial allied, so... do I need another one? hmmm? So... to gym or not to gym afterall I'm already doing my regular walks at bukit kiara reserved forest and a swim at riana green? Hmmm...?

      My car tires screeched as I turned at a sharp bend into the driveway of a restaurant today to pick up a male friend who was stranded by his wife. Yup, last minute calls of such: "Where are you, Angela? Can you do me a favour?" *Sigh* Same old, same old... and I made it to the restaurant in just 15 mins from a usual 25 mins from work. This is not beginning to sound good, "Angie to the rescue"... is beginning to rhyme with "Lassie to the rescue"... snap yer fingers and I'll run to rescue... geez.  This time is almost the worst ever... both the hubby (Y)& wifey (J)went out for a nice lunch together on their day off from work, but ended up having one of the most bitter quarrels ever. When I arrived at the restaurant, I thought Y was about to have a heart attack the moment he got into the car (I swear I've never seen a man so angry before... his hand on his heart and he was breathing like he ran a marathon!).   According to him, they had a major mouth war in the restaurant which was sparked from a simple topic - picking a name for their coming baby... (J's well into her 3rd month pregnancy now)... which led to many other issues of this and that. At one point, she stood up, grabbed the car keys and ran out crying and sped off in the car leaving him in the restaurant. While Y was telling me all these, his phone kept ringing, and I could see that it was J calling and he refused to pick it up. Seems like J's moving out tonight to a hotel, and will be dumping their daughter to her mother's place, while Y's going to pack up all her stuff from the house and place it at the road side because the house is his and he doesn't want her in the house anymore! Tomorrow they'll both be seeing a lawyer!!! Geez! How could this be? Why so harsh and reactive? Both these persons are adults and approaching their mid 30s!  I kept thinking "Where did all that love go?". Yup, and amongst my friends and myself, we've always said this is a marriage made in heaven (but what has gone wrong after 10 years?). They were so in love, and we've always admired them (role models, I'd say!). They are about the prettiest couple that you'll ever lay eyes on, and a beautiful 4-year-old to complete the pretty picture... and another baby coming along soon. I just can't figure out how could things be so bitter despite all these?     I was silent most of the time while I was driving Y back to his house. When I reached the house, his gate was wide opened and the car was in the garage. In the car, I could see J was slouched over the steering wheel, sobbing her eyes out with both hands in her hair! Y saw that too, but he said something really harsh about her crying... and how immuned he is to her tears... and he refused to go in and asked me to drive elsewhere, but I asked him to go home and rest as I need to work. I tried to advise him, "Please don't say anything when you are angry, if she can't be calm, you'll have to take lead to be the calm one. Too many hurtful things have been said today, and both of you might live to regret them later... so calm down and take a good rest... talk again when you have both calmed down". He said, "It's easier said than done, Angela, you're single, so stay that way. You won't understand what I'm going through. This marriage is over". I said, "Where did all the love go?", and he replied bitterly, "What love?"... and with that, he opened the car door and left and made a sign that he'll call later. He walked past the car and totally ignored her (she's still in the car) in the garage and went into the house, and I sped off ... thinking whether I should get down and comfort her... but felt that it's Y's & J's job to handle and deal with the marriage at a more mature level. So, I chose to drive off - just to stay away from all these - so mixed up!   To tell the truth, I'm shaken by today's episode. Though it has nothing to do with me, but the thought of ever going through such things personally, left both my hands and feet cold. Nothing comes in a bed of roses, but having said this, I don't know if I can go through such bitterness esp. those that tugs the strings of my heart - I might end up in a nut house?   My mind kept bouncing back to the image of poor J, slouched in the car sobbing her eyes out, and needing of comfort. I don't want to be in her position, and I think of Y, I don't want to be in his position either. I know how harsh and insensitive Y can be when he's pissed off, as I've known him longer than J. Y's a good friend, but too bloody egoistic and filled with expectations for how J should be like... and he never tells the 'truth' of how he feels, but flaps around her in frustration and agitation whenever he's unhappy with things. While J is on constant confusion, which made her a little neurotic and inferior whether she's doing the right thing or not. Both are guilty of having their own sets of expectations. Ah... typical... I've seen this before, not only in my own life, but also in others. I understand both of them and their frustrations, but why aren't they understanding each other?   Each time I hear of such things, the more fear I have for taking risks for love and less faith I have for sustaining love. I'm turning more into a cynic each day... While thinking of all these, I got a little upset with how tricky life could be and how ideals could turn out to be nightmares. | ended up getting lost in my thoughts and people that I know who are in a rut with their love ones all seeped into my thoughts at the same time. I eventually lost my sense of direction on the roads too - was in a road maze for an hour and couldn't see anything familiar around me - I didn't get back to work till it was almost 2pm --> almost 2 whole hours taken off work to help friends! *Sigh* I wonder whether they will help me when I'm in trouble one day.   I'm a little depressed with all these, and went to bed the moment I got home. I've been awake for 3 hours now, and will go back to get more sleep now...  say a quick prayer for them to get back together, most of all for the healing of broken hearts in this world, in this case, I hope there'll be two less broken hearts tonight. Tomorrow will be a better day... that's my only element of hope.

      My 'Angela's movie day out' is dampened by the new Potter 3 movie after all the anticipation, hype and hearsay of how great a movie it'll be! I'd rate it a C+ at the most (and that's being kind, mind you!). I left the theater with a pout big enough to hang at a few cloth-hangers. Argggh... you can well-imagine how frustrated I am as I went through a few failed attempts to obtain tix for the movie due to the past two-week school holidays - stuck in jams, and only to get into the mall to join a long line (Every theater that screens the Potter 3 was child-infested!).   Now, back to the movie... In comparison to the previous Potter movies, there's a little less 'real' Harry in the pot this time. Alfonso Cuaron has 'adultified' teeny bopper Harry by downplaying his heroic wand-waving skills into some modern-day and emotional-wrecked Harry. I see Cuaron's views in turning Harry into a real-life character rather than a fantasy one. Somehow, I prefer the fantasy one instead of what Cuaron has created?   Harry, as portrayed in Potter 3 scored a red in anger-management class ( remember Harry blew up his aunt when he lost his temper?). Though Cuaron did a good job on portraying the reality of life, there's death. However, this doesn't mean that Harry has to be turned into an emotional wimp rather than a wand-waving hero! *sigh*. Moreover, profound plots in the book have been slashed out so that the movie could portray more emotional scenes... geez!   'Death' in Potter 3, is portrayed in the form of 'Dementors', which bear a close resemblance to those of J.R. Tolkien's Nasguls. Does this mean both the J.R.s have the similar perceptions of how death manifests itself? Somehow, Tolkien's Nasguls are far more convincing in Peter Jackson's imagery world in LOTR than those of Cuaron's Dementors in Potter 3.    Anyway, I still prefer the previous HP movies' plots where I have no time to blink from the beginning to the end of the movie. Harry, as portrayed in the other two movies was far more mystical and magical, and definitely more befitting of the Harry in J.R. Rowling's descriptions.    Well, so much for Harry Potter... perhaps I'll be less critical when Potter 4 is out. I'm drained at the mo - time to get some shut-eye.

      Hmmm... this got me thinking after hearing from my beau on him missing Malaysia, Singapore etc.   So, what's so great about living in a place where mozzies and over-bearing humid days are an abundance? Wait a minute... there are tons of advantages living in the tropics, especially Malaysia.   I'm thinking... there are hardly any extreme weathers that would keep one at home other than the monsoon rains. Even when it seems to be raining buckets, as Malaysians, we know that the wet days won't last long. The weather can be predictable to an extent. I can just grab anything to wear from my wardrobe, and not worry about putting on layers of clothes in case there's a cold front. There ain't no such thing as a cold front and a wind chill in the tropics, hehe.   Every morning, I wake up to the sunlight bursting through my windows... and it's really in a way, a paradise to be greeted by sunlight and listening to birds chirping away (at least I hear that).   The nights, oh the nights... I get occasional starry skies and gentle breeze in the evenings. Usually the weather is conducive enough for a good outdoorsey life. I know of many jogging trails, nice beaches, open air swimming pools, camping sites, and the list goes on.    In fact, living in Malaysia, you'll never go hungry again! Such a food paradise cum heaven (with many shops opened 24/7). One can choose from fine dining to just simple zinc top / umbrella shaded stalls... you can get just about the yummiest foods.  You can even quench your thirst at any place, name the drink you want... ranging from liquors to liquers, pilsners to lagers. and decaf. to caffeined coffees and teas, fruit infusions to fresh juices... it's endless!  Even when you're not in the mood to dine out, there are tons of places where you can get fresh veggies, fruits and meats sold ... and most places close at 10:00p.m., even the night markets, hyper markets and marts. Not forgetting that this place is a shopping paradise - with malls everywhere, plus the city hardly sleeps. That's not so bad afterall... hmmm?   The point here is that, why are we never truly satisfied with what we have? This is a blessed 'green' country, and I should be grateful and happy with what Malaysia has to offer and enjoy things as the way they are. It took me a very long time to see these little blessings in life, but I now do see that there are drippings of joy living in the tropics... you'll just need to be appreciative of things :).

      Waking up drenched in sweat just to find out that the airconditioning ain't working no more is already a bad sign for the day... I can't live without an airconditioner... waahhhhh!!!! *sob*   Getting to work seemed to be good though, as there's no heavy traffic or any horrid driver cutting into my lane out of no where like any other day. Not bad... didn't have to step on emergency brakes. The day went ok, had three meetings today - one with my VP, next was the Financial Controller and another one with the dry old English Prof on curriculum. To tell the truth, all 3 meetings were no more exciting than chewing on sawdust... but work is work... and there are lots of things to do on my part to meet more deadlines.   When the mid afternoon drew near, I realised that 'the time of the month' has arrived with lots of discomfort, which seemed to get a little more painful as each minute passes by. I thought I could stand the pain when Doreen asked me if I wanted ponstan from her, and I made a joke that ponstans are a tad bit less effective than morphine. Yes, as Doreen disappeared up the flights of steps, I was hit by stronger wave of major cramps there and felt my legs tremble... my energy's going fast. I regretted at that moment by not saying 'yes' to ponstan! I gathered my remaining strength and ran skelter helter down two flights of steps, folded myself in almost two... to Dr. Molly's clinic biting my lip all the way and breaking out into cold sweat.   The moment I reached Dr. Molly's office, I slumped on the chair and instantly curled into a foetus position. Painful! The question came, "What can I do for you, Angela?" I said, "pain relievers, please." I popped two colourful tablets and lay down on the clinic bed, but the pain didn't go away... not even after 20 minutes! Dr. Molly checked on me again and told me that she's going to give me a jab... which I took obediently. In less than 5 minutes, I'm up and about again! Said my grateful little thank-yous and bopped out of the clinic.   Ah... what a day... and me now... writing this... I'm all ok at the mo, and cooking soupie with lots of chicken in it ... yums... I believe in the goodness of chix soup.... maybe my monday ain't so blue afterall.

      Yup, I went off to a Christian conference organised by the B & P ministry but didn't end up going to most of it's praise and worship sessions nor it's messages. However, I was on time for every meal session and truly maximised my gluttony.   I shared the room with two other girlies from work, and together we absconded most of the events. It wasn't that I didn't want to attend the sessions arranged for us, however, I didn't feel too comfortable with the way things were conducted... the message and testimonies were mainly on the business successes of the B & P members - so money-oriented. I didn't like it one bit.   We were the most obedient on the first day, the welcome session had us 3 drooling over this really good looking Kiwi speaker (he looks like a football star!) till he started sharing about his wife and kids - we got totally turned off - hehehe. However, he was nice enough to give a prayer of blessing to both Lai Lai and myself. Whoah... upclose and personal... so cute looking! But, hey... we're both there for the prayers not to look at him! haha! Anyway, we were good, we bowed our heads and prayed together said our little thank yous after the prayer and left without looking back - we were actually not interested at all?! I think that was God working through us, and totally not tempting us at all! lol  Anyway, we stayed throughout the worship session, and then 50% of the message for the night... and after that... we became restless... 3 of us hatched a little plan by not re-entering the room in 3s again. So, I was sent to go in and pack up and then go back to the room, while my roomies left the hall first and were waiting for me outside... I picked up Doreen's new Bible (yup bright yellow Good news version and a gift from her beloved bossie!) and stuff... and I thought Lai Lai didn't take her stuff across the table. So, I steathily crossed over here and there trying to make a really quiet departure from the hall. I took this nice-looking Bible across me that has a cover zipper and lots of little notes and a pen - stuffed everything inside and zipped it up... and tucked it under my arm, thinking that it was Lai Lai's... though I did notice the lady who sat beside Lai Lai kept looking at what I was doing...with her eyes growing bigger by the minute... I thought she was just being nosy, so I ignored her. I was satisfied that I've done a good job by packing everything up, and took one last look and went 'oops... almost forgot Doreen's menthos sweets'. Finally, I slowly stood up, and even pushed the chair back without a sound, and no one turned around except the same irritating lady who's eyes are rounder than saucers by now. I looked at her blankly this time, wondering what does she want... and she pointed to my arm and mimed "That's mine" ... I was so embarassed... and all of a sudden, everyone at the table looked at me wondering what was going on!!! HAHAHA! I was in the spotlight... errr... I mimed a 'Sorry' followed with lots of smiles in my embarassment... and quickly returned the stuff to her (good thing she is very forgiving too, afterall it was a mistake and nobody steals Bibles!). So much for wanting a quiet exit, I made a loud one instead... as everyone on the round table was looking at me with curious eyes . Oh well, that's life... don't we all make little blunders in life? When I got out of the hall, I related the little incident to the girls, and they had a good laugh over my silliness. Poor me!   Morning time was supposedly our 'quiet time' in where all the 3 of us were required to pray and share with another member of our focus group. That's us, we're the 'cherry blossom' girls... and it's obvious if 3 young women are missing in the group of 10. I think I was a tad bit too direct with the lady who woke us up for the quiet times.... the first line she had for us after we introduced our names were, "I was told all of you are not Christians"... duh? That got me ticked off... here, we have a stranger, trying to get a glimpse into our lives and checking our 'Christian lineage' ... plus our knowledge of Christiandom. I was turned off by the rest of the line of questioning there, really! I don't even dare to ask how my other girlfriend, who is a non-Christian, felt... Hmmmpf! So, there I went, straight to the point of not wanting to be part of the 'quiet time' group, as I believe quiet times are to be spent by yourself or with someone you're comfortable with... I was curt in some ways, and that probably made the lady feel that all the 3 of us are heathens! lol!! Err... probably just me, aye? Nevertheless, she went on and on about the story of 'man & God'... and I quipped in from time to time to shorten what she wants to say. Later on, I excused 'us' from the 'quiet time' as we wanted to go for our morning swim at the pool.   However, who am I to complain? I paid a subsidised rate for the weekend where the package includes food, transportation and lodging. Yums... the food was really good, and we were just a good 100 feets' walk from the beach side. All the 3 of us were totally spoilt over the weekend, and we even laid out on the beach and got ourselves a little tan, plus a jacuzzi and sauna session! Nice, nice, nice!   I had a splitting headache after my beach-whale session with Doreen that morning... and missed out on the beach games ... but joined the girls for a beer (I didn't have one, they did!). Anyway... I wish I had a sip of that golden liquid, it looked so tempting ... but the thought of having a recurring headache made me stay away from all that gold that 'glitters'... hehe.  *Yawn*... ok... I need a catnap now... completely tired out from the long ride back to Cheras, and then me driving home to PJ to only get stuck in the jam for another freaking hour... hmmm... so much for my weekend!

      I  kya karuu.n haa'e, kuchh kuchh hota hai   ... that's how the song trails off in the hindi movie, lol! Literally means "What shall I do?  Something happens (in my heart)" - in English.     Anyway, I'm NOT referring to a man in regards to the song...it was my infatuation with a pretty pink & gold gossamer-like silk sari... 8 years ago!! I spent just as many years trying to search for the right   choli   (a short blouse worn under the sari) to go with it!   This song goes back to my old work place... I was one of the 'maidens' in a sketch about 3 years ago when I had to don on a sari and dance & sing to the song. It was really fun, and we did that at the students' annual ball where the top & middle management had to come up with a sketch to entertain the students! In a team of 12 persons, we decided to play the ever-famous Sha Rukh Khan's  kuchh kuchh hota hai   movie / song and make a spoof out of it!   Well, that's the only 'sari' history I have till now. Many thanks to my East Indian boss's (Shanker) wedding ceremony on 6th June 2004, I resumed with my search for the  choli  . As one of the usherers for the night, I wanted to blend into the culture and surroundings, which gave me a reason to dress up like a traditional 'Indian'... yup, complete with the   bindi   (sticker on the forehead), bangles, nose pin,   sindoor   sticker (a dot or any other decorative piece to decorate the forehead), matching gold necklace & earrings, and a pair of Indian gold sandals!   The  kuchh kuchh hota hai   song was playing in my mind when I tagged along with Priya & Ernie all the way to Klang, a godforsaken   jin bertendang   (genie's haven) place to shop for the required knick knacks to go with the occassion. Alas, I still couldn't find the right  choli   and decided to have one tailor-made. I hopped from one shop to the next requesting to have rolls and rolls of champagne-gold material to be brought out - what a wonderful variety to choose from!   So, I went to this tailor who's an Indian nationale - can't speak a word of English or Bahasa Malaysia... and I couldn't understand a word of Tamil! It's a good thing that Priya was around to tell him what I want to do and so forth. So, everything's settled now :).     Hmmm.... I'll need Priya's mom to help me to 'tie' the sari for me before I go to Shanker's wedding - so looking forward to that :).

      Goldfish eyes, so filled with&nbsp;despair, Mine eyes have swelled like&nbsp;thee,  Seeming to tear even when weather so fair,  Everything of solace,&nbsp;I want not to see,  If magnified,&nbsp;I will resemble&nbsp;a glacier, So cold and distant, and never warm, A reflection of joy would make&nbsp;me fancier, But the pain I feel&nbsp;could&nbsp;do me harm, They can't brighten up even in&nbsp;glee, For now the sadness has chosen to live, As&nbsp;happiness comes, I will not flee, Perhaps with love, joy&nbsp;I might give, With a glance, I might appear sad, Look carefully, I am actually glad! &nbsp;

      The link between these words, 'Woman&nbsp;... kitchen... Food '&nbsp;is birthed by&nbsp;Egoistic&nbsp;Chinese men... and it's profoundly ludicrous and out of the world kind of experience especially when you're living with one! Even Tarzan has more table manners and better choice of vocab!  &nbsp;  It's amazing that I am still going through such pains&nbsp;as a professional and grown woman!!! At this age, I'm not supposed to be&nbsp;having bitter mouth wars with my brother, 'the emperor' of the house. At this moment, I'd be more glad at writing his eulogy *sigh*. The little sweet boy I grew up with has somehow morphed into a giant wrangley rat that gnaws on my toes if dinner is not served on time or spew&nbsp;a&nbsp;creative string&nbsp;of  urlLink 'F***'  words or it's synonyms in the form of epithets&nbsp;for my hard days' work or any blood & sweat efforts. Sometimes I wonder, what went wrong? All of us siblings are made the same way, and are from the same factory! So, where&nbsp;did that  urlLink monster  come from?  &nbsp;  It all began this way... I came back unusually late&nbsp;this evening but made a call home beforehand to tell bro that I don't feel like cooking tonight. Guess what's his answer?&nbsp;A pathetic whine that goes this way "...but I've boiled the rice and soaked the vegetables'. I said, '...but I'm too tired, you go ahead and cook it if you want to, but I'm not cooking tonight'. So, he  urlLink grunted  a 'yes' and the phone went dead. So, I took my time, driving home&nbsp;-  extra slow&nbsp; -&nbsp;as my eyes are blurred from the whole day looking at the excel sheet on the monitor.  &nbsp;  When I got home, I took out the days' groceries from the car into the house (I'm almost a perfect sister! Ran about the mall buying foodstock during my lunch hour!).&nbsp;Bro and gf wer urlLink e slumped  on the couch watching TV, and didn't even bother to help me with the groceries. So, I wobbled slowly into the house, and finally when I set everything down in the kitchen, bro cocked his head to the side to peer at me (he was  urlLink trying&nbsp;be cute &nbsp;in front of the girlfriend)&nbsp;and said, "we've prepared everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;you just need to cook". I was irritated, and replied, "I'm too tired to do that". That's where all the insults started, right there, and&nbsp;right then --> in front of his girlie -- totally no respect for me!   THE MOUTH WAR HAS BEGUN....      &nbsp;  He lost it. He started&nbsp;using all&nbsp;sorts&nbsp;of&nbsp;profanities on me as if I'm worthless for feeling tired after returning from a days' work!&nbsp;He said tons of things that&nbsp;are linked to referring me as some low life because I'm too tired to cook! I&nbsp;told&nbsp;him off that he has no manners and has no respect. Then&nbsp;he threw a mental verbal that went hand in hand with his&nbsp;boasting&nbsp;about him being the owner of the house,&nbsp;and he could kick me out anytime, and he was not joking about it! Not with the kind of red-faced shout and knitted eye-brows! I got so flared up upon seeing and hearing all&nbsp;that and started screaming back at him that he could not even afford to get a loan without my help. Then he challenged me, 'So, what can you do, revoke your name from the loan?'. That's it, I blew up and ran up to the room to get the lawyer's number. All of a sudden, he got jittery but still no sign of remorse... &nbsp;and he was close at heel&nbsp;from the behind and hurling more&nbsp;insults! I turned around and pointed right at his nose, and said, "stop it, you have no right to say anything to me". He said, 'I am angry and I say lots of things I don't mean'. I said, 'too late', and more ear-withering-insults came through. I slammed my room door 0n time, and&nbsp;was shaking&nbsp;in anger and crying away.  &nbsp;  The next thing I did was&nbsp;to call Dad... *sigh* and let him know that I cannot delay the lawyer's letter that states my share of the house as bro is so 'big-headed' and claiming ownership when the house is only 50% his! Though the house title is in his name as 'parents insisted'... despite the rest of the 50%&nbsp;is from Dad, sister and me...&nbsp;&nbsp;I told Dad of the situation and&nbsp;have made a decision, 'no more cooking and no more running the house and being taken for granted by my ungrateful brother!'... and need to check with Dad before I revoke my name from the loan else parents will throw a wobbly and take the first flight&nbsp;over to be at the emperor's side thinking that I have been unfair!&nbsp;*Geez*&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, Dad talked me out of revoking my name out of the loan, as both himself and sis have put in most of their monies for the down payment while Bro has still not come up with a cent! If I revoke my name, meaning that the 10% will be washed down the drain and bro still wouldn't care! There I go again, telling Dad off for spoiling his son and making him into a 32-yr-old monster and letting him know all those lands and whatever heirloom to him name a tad bit too early!&nbsp;So, bro become an&nbsp;overnight millionaire and&nbsp;at the same time became more ungrateful than ever by even living off his sisters! He's going to marry soon, and soon, the little woman will live off me and sis too! *frown*&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On the phone, Dad said 'you don't know how to handle your brother'. I was seething when I heard this and said sarcastically, "How would you suggest I'd handle him?". Dad said, "Just walk away when he shouts at you". I said, "What? He was saying all sorts of sick words at me in front of his gf and WY!!" Dad said, "Someone has to give in". I went speechless, and continued, "I cannot be like you, Dad, I will not walk away from&nbsp;being bullied". Dad continued saying, "then you will lose your brother one day". I said, "I won't have a brother for long if he continues to give me a mental shakes of such, I've had it for as long as I can remember and live". I could hear Mom going off saying, "Oh, oh, oh... what is he going to eat if she won't cook for him?". I felt like screaming into the phone piece, "MOM, YOUR SON IS 32 YEARS OLD, LET HIM GROW UP!"  &nbsp;  *Sigh*... anyway, I give up... and just went on to what I&nbsp; have decided - NO MORE DINNERS FOR THE LITTLE EMPEROR! I called for this little family meeting after I have cooled down, and said calmly in front of WY and bro that I will no longer cook from then on. Bro got really upset, and said, "You should not take such drastic steps for something so small... the matter will blow over". I said, "No, I think this is the best thing to do so that we will not be obligated to each other and it'll end all quarrels". Bro continued, "My relationship with you is already bad, if you don't cook, it'll be worse". "For six years I've been cooking everyday, have you appreciated it and have you become better? Anyway, I've decided, you take care of your food from now on". I wanted to say more, but he cut my little speech, and he said, "Point taken, and if that's what you want, and I promise you, things will worsen from now on...".  &nbsp;  Whatever that means, I still think I deserve a Superwoman Award and a little sympathy from my parents. Oh yeah, sis is also in the same boat as I am... we're soon to be seen as 'evil daughters' by parents for being the way we are, and of course, we're the 'evil sisters' to bro and his gf for not 'serving' bro... and for all I know, I see Bro's gf has totally taken over the washing of his clothes and ironing and mopping the house! Wow! All of bro's chores... we've got a new maid... and Bro's marrying her.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wooo hoooo! I feel good now... I let my 'angry little asian girl tantrums' out... I'm on the road to recoverrrrrrryyyyyyyy! Yippppeeee! lol *I'm going insane, maybe I can join a nunnery in Greece!*  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      In our sisterly gossips and exchanging of ideas, my sister and I mulled over this in a 2-hour trunk call all the way from London! So, back to the topic, our point of reference is that of our childhood girlfriends, whom are happily married. Eventhough we are happy for them, we still feel that our girlfriends deserve much, much better men!  It's interesting to see how they went about sacrificing by completely going through a change of lifestyle, diet, and even preferences and choices in life. Much to our chagrin, they have even moulded themselves to be the women that their husbands wanted them to be - lost their natural sheen, made Marie France's owner's pockets bloat with cash too - they've became insignificant to who they were originally created as... their beliefs, what they fought for, educated for and lived for, to name a few. However, the husbands are never 'the men that they ever wanted', but stretched out to fit what our girls could 'make do' with - to be part of the norm instead of being competantly matched. Something changed along the way, such is the tale of destiny.  In soothing their men's pride, our gal pals chose to elavate them on pedestals by allowing them to take lead, while them girls take a backseat in their lives and career. Blame it on the treacherous ticking of the biological clock and also peer pressure, they have succumbed and simplified their choices - sad, but true.  We've witnessed both extreme scenarios ranging from days of being lovey-dovey to bitter. When the bitter gets going, it's gets tougher... our girls would go with their 'whys' and turn completely emotive, while their men would be defensive by being factual, discounting their wives' reasoning as being illogical. When the woman gains a momentum in coming out 'right' in the situation, the man would dive into anatomical referrals as a 'get back', but just as equally emotive. When the man turns out to be 'right', the hammering continues till the woman is almost reduced to tears. Unfair! For all the right reasons sis and I could not help but to feel ripples of disgust and waves of cringes through us when we witness them airing their dirty linen. Gender communication issues? It's just a battle of ego. Must the man be victorious by proving that he can have the last word? How could she ever be deserving of such verbal mentals irregardless to whether she's right or wrong? Can't one be civil and reasonable? Sometimes it's better to be kind than to be right at all times.  At times, we find that their men can be selfish and egoistic louts who lack appreciation for landing themselves priceless gems. On the other hand, our girls are a little too soft and easy going, leaving them vulnerable to being unintentionally bullied by their men. Sis and I agreed to the fact that many Asiatic women are a little that way, by choice. Are they emulating their mothers' way (genetic, hmmm?).  Now, now, these men are considered a 'good catch' in the society, both in outlooks, career plus the bonus of being a tad bit minted. Not forgetting that they've also gone through the mill of formal education, with the add-ons of being jaded with experience and perhaps, tarnished with exposure. However, they still lack common sense and tact - it's only human to err? In true fact, such persons should have at least learned some refinery in words and actions (that's the 'no-excuses' bit in me quipping). The most crass words (downright disparaging and unacceptable) can leak from these educated mouths. All these only made sis and I think that once these men have contracted an allergy to gallantry.  We took a look at our girlfriends again, and find them not derailing far from their gorgeous ol' selves, but why are their men not supportive of them at all times? Isn't that part of the marriage vow - 'for better or for worse'? What left sis and I aghast and agawked are that our girlfriends still look up to their men adoringly despite all that's said and all those unacceptable vibes! Mag once said to me in regards to a specific rough spot she went through, "That's love for ya, Ange". I gave her a quizzical look, and I guess I'll really never understand.  Though we have given a benefit of a doubt that what we have witnessed from our very human eyes are truly private affair and also a husbandry-wifery hum drums cum affection. Still, our girls complain but do nothing about it. When we quiz our girls at times, they'd defend with something to this effect: 'You will never understand this unless you are married'... which means that our opinion is completely discounted and we are left with only the choice of listening but stinge on our comments or viewpoints.  Right, our girlfriends' men do not measure up to Greek gods, neither from the back, nor the pinky of their phalanges. No, no, no, am not saying that the crust matters the most, but it's all that underneath the crust.  Even on their men's most neutral days and best behaviours, we've seen them comparing their wives to other women on the street, creating a benchmark for their wives as an epitome of 'what a woman should be like'. Hey, after a couple of kids, the woman's body changes and will never regain the same shape again. Their men never want their women to be any different from the day that they married them. Makes both sis and I think that whether in time to come, when our gal pals have weathered naturally, would their men toss them aside like old teddies of yesteryear's Christmas? Is he worthy of all her sacrifice?  Sis and I never agreed to that of course, but we continued to be polite and supportive. However, we are making notes like mad, and reminding ourselves to never marry till we are competantly matched and would take no nonsense. Maybe that's our problem? lol Oh well, at least that's how both sis and I feel about how originality and the acceptance of individuality should be the priority. Though the interesting bit here is that there is no formula in being rightfully matched, but it definitely takes two to tango.  Anyway, we moved on to contrasting our darling Margie, Kit, CC, Mag and Jo to other close girlfriends who are divorced. It's interesting to see the tough ones who brave it all through an amazing race of survival by not wanting to be slighted in anyway, but they overdid it by emasculating their men. In this sense, we are looking at things from a biased view point - their men are truly not good enough to measure up?  We gathered our memory on days that our gal pals spoke to us in great lengths about the flaws of their men before marriage and more flaws unfurled after marriage - their heartbreaks and all (of course, we hear less from them when they're happy, but constant calls from them when they are sad!).  When our girls' complaints came, we listened, and only offer advise of keeping the marriage together and to forgive the bad that has occured. They all eventually made up, and lived on happily again till the next episode of disagreement cropped up. Vicious cycle, but they've made their beds, so the best advise is to lie on it and make the best out of it. Ah... you get the drift... it still goes back to the question in our minds again, "Is he worthy of her?" whenever our girlfriends choke on their tears when they tell us how broken hearted and disappointed they are ...  Anyway, both sis and I love and also know our girlfriends so well that we feel that not many men are worthy of them and would appreciate the beauty of their qualities. Our girlfriends knew and also love us in return, but at the end of the day, we have our own lives to lead, and more choices to make as long as we are still single. We learn from their experiences, and it makes us more wary of what lies ahead of us than to take things for granted.  We also realised that we have slapped on expectations that are so tall that no ordinary men can meet up to how we feel of our gal pals! Likewise, it clicked in sis and I that we are not married to this day because we think in such a way, as in 'no one's worthy of sacrifice' other than the Sovereign God. It's a good thing that our girlfriends are a far shot from our idealistic or possible unrealistic ideologies.  With our articulated ways and non-too-traditional mannerisms, we are banished to the category of being 'anglosised Malaysian chicks'. Such views seem to lace with our snootiness too, as both are growing exponentially as the years go by. Is there something wrong with us? Too prim and proper?  We can't seem to get along with our Malaysian men as partners due to their mentality and the outrageous ego (at least that is what we have experienced, but we understand that this is not true and applicable to every Malaysian lass out there), and we are definitely not short of them as suitors as well (though the numbers have declined as we aged). All we need is to 'simplify' our needs by closing one eye... maybe both eyes? 'Just lie back and think of Malaysia' kind of mentality? Our gal pals, who appear to be very much like us (that's why we are almost inseparable as we were growing up), evolved and took up the challenge and made the effort to jive and fill in the gap, by seeing more similarities than differences in their men to themselves.  Hence, sis and I agreed to the fact as we grow, our priorities in life changes, and there'll be repercussions in whatever we decide on. We are well aware of not following the pathways our girlfriends have taken, and we do not want to be part of the statistics of the declining world as some of our gal pals have hit red on, but can we avoid them all since we are emotive creatures?  What we held dearly to are our dignity and how comfortable we are of ourselves and how much we can't sacrifice 100% of our comforts just for the sake of marriage! Where's the middle ground in this? We too realised that we will discover where the middle ground is when we reach that stage, but right now, we are not going to brood and sweat over it. As for now, we are convinced that there's nothing wrong in thinking the way we thought, are thinking and will think. It's just a matter of us being 'us' and we are not ashamed to be ourselves, and be all optimistic and confident of all that life brings forth. We will take our own growth and discoveries in our own stride, and perhaps in time to come, before our destiny fuses, the right fellow who appreciates our originality will drop out from the sky and into our arms! lol  As for our gal pals? As long as they believe that their men are worthy of them, we will accelerate on the mental support, and even physical ones if we can afford them. Life's too short to regurgitate and reanalyse and regret, aye?  In my time, my eyes have risen and fallen on the few men that have passed me by. Likewise, my sister is not exempted either from similar kind of experiences - yeah, the same old story of love and betrayal. Relooking at life once again, my sis and I evaluated where we stand right now, in our 30s, we love this age, we enjoy our freedom, we love ourselves dearly. With this, my sister, in turn, asked me of my relationship in my 30s compared to the one that I had in my 20s, and I paused for a second before answering, "I am more confident in saying that who I am seeing now is all the man that I want in my life." The next question that popped out of Aggie's mouth is, "Are you all the woman that he wants in his life?". I said, "I'll let him answer that, because he's in his 30s too". Yeah, peals of girlie laughter followed suit (don't think anyone would get this joke).  At the end of the conversation, popped back to the topic again, and sis and I felt that the least we could do as a continuous support to our girlfriends. That is to accept things the way it is - when they are happy, we will rejoice with them, when they cry, we will comfort them. However, we promised to remind each other that we must never, ever lose our identity when we are matched in the future. We want our men and us to be worthy of each other through mutual respect and acceptance - to be equally yoked. Is that too much to ask for?

      I scrambled off my bed this morning at 9:00a.m. sharp upon realising that I'm late for my appointment at a clinic for my bloodtest. Yeah, yeah... it's supposed to be an annual affair, but I've skipped it last year.  My brother, who booked the appointment for both his girlie and myself at the clinic obediently drove us to this health clinic... and there were tons of people there in line, all wanting to do exactly the same thing --> take their bloodtest.  Shanice (bro's girlie) went in first, and she came out having this really 'pained look on her face'. I swore she looked a teeny weeny bit 'greenish'  on the face as she's frightened of needles too. Soon, my name is called, yes... it's my turn. I walked into the cold room, feeling all jittery, thinking of the needle and my past experience more than 18 years ago where a nurse at the government hospital poked my arm several times but failed to draw a drop of blood (I was suspected of having diabetes then, and to make sure that I'm clear I had to take the blood test). In her failure to draw my blood, she said this to me, "Young lady, you appear 'veinless', you must have never done any hard work of carried any heavy things before in your life". I was too young and stupid then to disagree with her, and to tell the truth, she made the wrong assumptions then... My mom has the same prob, and guess who I took after? Yeah, mommy dearest. In the end, after at least 7 attempts at poking into my arm painfully, the silly nurse gave up and decided to draw the needed tube of blood from the back of my palm which is a double 'ouch'... I still have that little scar at the back of my palm to this day.  So, here I am, 18 years later, filled with my vivid memory of the past, I looked at the middle-aged lady, who is all smiles and holding a cotton swab with one hand and also a syringe ready to go for my arm. This time, I spoke up and told her, "Look, nobody can find my veins, so make sure that you show me where my vein is before you put the syringe in". The lady quickly replied without missing a beat, "ok, let me see, I'm sure I can find it". There she went, kept on slapping my arm (poor arm!!) till it was all red and angry looking... but still, no vein is visible... and she started to press her thumb over that poor patch of red skin, trying to feel all over the inside of my elbow and said, "I can feel the vein, but I can't see it, let's give it a try". I nodded, and quickly looked away. Those were the longest moments of my life... my knees were buckling, going all soft and at the same time, I'm going a little faintish.  I blinked several times, thinking how pathetic I am at this age, and still so frightened of syringes. Soon after that, I felt the needle poking in, and there was quite a bit of pain and numbness going on there, and I'm not sure whether it's psychological or whatever, but I'm about to bolt out of the clinic. Before I knew it, she said, "Now, relax, we're almost done", and soonish after that, I felt the cold swab of the cotton. I bent my arm, and looked back at the lady, and she's still all smiles and said, "Now that's not so bad, isn't it?". I felt such a great relief washing over me... and said my little polite thank you with a smile and walked out with my arm bent and skipped happily out of the cold room.  My bro was outside, waiting for me and said, "Was she good with needles?"... I said, "She's ok". I realised that I'm a little less frightened each time I go for a bloodtest... perhaps, one day, my knees will not buckle anymore, and the past memory? Well, it'll soon be there for good --> the past. So, good ol' bro decided to buy his girlie and me a nice Hong Kong Dim Sum for being good girls and not make a fuss over the bloodtest!!! haha! How apt! The food was yummy, and serves as a good reward for what I went through that morning ... hehe!
