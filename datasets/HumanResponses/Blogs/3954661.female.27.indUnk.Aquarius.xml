       -"Lazarus"   Mulder:  (threatening) You listen to me --- you lay one hand on Scully, and so help me God ----  *X*X*X*   -"Tooms"   Mulder:  They're out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully. I don't know why, but any excuse will do. Now, I don't really care about my record, but you'd be in trouble just for sitting in this car and I'd hate to see you to carry an official reprimand in your file because of me.  Scully:  Fox....  Mulder:  I... I... even made my parents call me "Mulder".  Scully:  Mulder, I wouldn't put myself on the line for anybody but you.  *X*X*X*   -"Chinga"   Mulder:  It sounds to me like that's witchcraft or maybe sorcery that you're looking for there.  Scully:  No, I don't think it's witchcraft, Mulder, or sorcery. I've had a look around and I don't see any evidence of anything that warrants that kind of suspicion.  Mulder:  Maybe you don't know what you're looking for.  Scully:  Like evidence of conjury or the black arts, or shamanism, divination, wicca or any kind of pagan or neo-pagan practices. Charms, cards, familiars, bloodstones, or hex signs or any kind of ritual tableaux associated with the occult, santeria, voudoun, macumba, or any high or low magic.  Mulder:  Scully?  Scully:  Yes?  Mulder:  Marry me.  *X*X*X*   -"Millennium"  [After they kiss and looks into each others eyes.]  Mulder:  Well, the world didn't end.  Scully:  No, it didn't.  [After that magical kiss they walk away. Mulders arm around Scully's shoulder.]  Mulder:  Happy New Year Scully.  Scully:  Happy New Year Mulder.  *X*X*X*   -"all things"   Mulder:  I just find it hard to believe.  Scully:  What part?  Mulder:  The part where I go away for two days and your whole life changes.  Scully:  Mmm, I didn't say my whole life changed.  Mulder:  You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple. God speaking back.  Scully:  Mmm, and I didn't say that God spoke back. I said that I had some kind of a vision.  Mulder:  Well, for you, that's like saying you're having David Crosby's baby. What is it?  Scully:  I once considered spending my whole life with this man. What I would have missed.  Mulder:  I don't think you can know. I mean, how many different lives would we be leading if we made different choices. We... we don't know.  Scully:  What if there was only one choice and all the other ones were wrong? And there were signs along the way to pay attention to.  Mulder:  Mmm. And all the... choices would then lead to this very moment. One wrong turn, and... we wouldn't be sitting here together. Well, that says a lot. That says a lot, a lot, a lot. That's probably more than we should be getting into at this late hour.  *X*X*X*   -"Requiem"   Mulder:  It's not worth it, Scully.  Scully:  What?  Mulder:  I want you to go home.  Scully:  Oh, Mulder, I'm going to be fine.  Mulder:  No, I've been thinking about it. Looking at you tonight, holding that baby . . . knowing everything that's been taken away from you. A chance for motherhood and your health and that baby. I think that . . . I don't know, maybe they're right.  Scully:  Who's right?  Mulder:  The FBI. Maybe what they say is true, though for all the wrong reasons. It's the personal costs that are too high.  Mulder:  There so much more you need to do with your life. There's so much more than this.  Mulder:  (whisper) There has to be an end, Scully.   Scully:  Mulder, if any of this is true...  Mulder:  If it is, or if it isn't, I want you to forget about it, Scully.  Scully:  Forget about it?  Mulder:  You're not going back out there. I'm not going to let you go back out there.  Scully:  What are you talking about?  Mulder:  It has to end some time. That time is now.  Scully:  Mulder...  Mulder:  Scully, you have to understand that they're taking abductees. You're an abductee. I'm not going to risk... losing you.  Scully:  I won't let you go alone.  *X*X*X*   -"Existence (2)"   Mulder:  I think what we feared where the possibilities ... The truth we both know.  Scully:  Which is what? [Mulder leans in and kisses Scully on the lips. Scully accepts the kiss, she takes her arm and embraces Mulder; the camera pans out, leaving the agents to a real, full-fledged, long, loving kiss.]    That was some Mulder/Scully quotes. More is coming soon...

      ...to place the link on my fave name site here. I had to wait for the creator Mike C. to give it. It's called "Behind the Name (BtN in daily term)".  So here it is:   urlLink www.behindthename.com   You can check almost every one of my fave names in there. There's a few though that's not there. It's also a great community where we end up becoming friends and we can discuss our glowing obsession with names.  I'll get my lists in later. There's a lot of names on them.

      I have had a geek-ish weakness for names since the age of 10. Yes there's this movement out there, and we are normal people, we just have this obsession. Like someone who knows all about I don't know what...  I have lists on lists of my fave names. And I just re-did my Top 10 lists.  GIRLS: 01) Nikita 02) Amelia 03) Augusta 04) Calleigh 05) Philippa 06) Selina 07) Ainsley 08) Genevieve 09) Liesel 10) Scarlett  BOYS: 01) Elliott 02) Bastian 03) Kieran 04) Horatio 05) Xavier 06) Maximilian 07) Shiloh 08) Stellan 09) Mikhail 10) Eamon  Nikita and Elliott has been my faves since my early teens. Amelia and Bastian too.  This was the start of my new blog.

      So it's a week or so since my last post. Not a whole Hell of a lot has happened, well there was something very big happening in my neighbourhood Wednesday, but I'll return to that in a while. I'll do a day by day re-count of what has happened.  MONDAY: Nothing big except for being&nbsp;the usual boring day.   TUESDAY: Went to eat at the&nbsp;best&nbsp;Chineese restaurant in town. Had a buffee which is so bad when you are me. I love Chineese food so of course I ate too much. I was practically rolling from the table, like&nbsp;some sort of a ball.   WEDNESDAY: As the clock approached 4 am Wednesday morning,&nbsp;still up and sitting infront of my computer, I heard heavy noices of police cars and ambulances approach rapidly. I really didn't put two and two together at that time but I later, that morning, learned that they had been called to an apartment not long from mine. To what was a murder that had&nbsp;happened there. A jealous x-boyfriend had shown up at&nbsp;the x-girlfriends apartment, and shot the new boyfriend twice to the stomach and once to the head, with one of these sporting guns. Scary. Really, really scary given the though that, if it wasn't for trees in the line of sight, I can see this apartment clearly from my windows. I haven't been that way yet since it happened. Proberly because I need to comprehend what had happened before I can go there. Maybe tomorrow.&nbsp; Also because murder isn't what usually happens in my town. So...  On a side note I stubbed my right little toe. So it swelled&nbsp;in size and&nbsp;turned every color somewhat.  THURSDAY: Zip happened.  FRIDAY: Ditto!  SATURDAY: Likewis.  And that brings me to SUNDAY: Slept in. Slept very much in as I do on Sundays. I've been watching TV and been on the computer. Nothing else.  So that was my week. The time here in Denmark are about 30 minutes from hitting midnight.&nbsp;About 32 minutes from being very early&nbsp;Monday morning.   That was my week in re-count.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I have this obsessive&nbsp;weakness for first&nbsp;names.  &nbsp; Meaning I love to investigate where a name's from. What it means and so one. It's an obsession coming from when I was 10 years old, and began to notice names and the beauty in some of them. I have lists of all of my fave boy and girl names. A lot of them.  &nbsp; My name, Charlotte,&nbsp;derives from Charles. Pretty good hunch of my parents since I've been a tomboy my whole life. So I can allove myself using the nick name Charlie, whenever I feel like it. (But the truth is more,&nbsp;that I was named 50/50,&nbsp;after a beloved late Danish actress. That and because my Dad loved the name Charlotte.) My fave Girl name is Nikita Amelia and for a Boy it's Elliott Bastian. I've been accused of liking strange names but big deal... I'm strange myself so I don't really care. I'll post some other names in time...&nbsp;

       So this is my first ever try on having a blog,&nbsp;so I'm a total Newbie to this.  &nbsp;  This entry is just a try-out to see if it all&nbsp;works out. I'm a little unsure understandable.     &nbsp;   This will be a place for my daily thoughts about&nbsp;all and everything. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So bye for now...  &nbsp;  - Charlotte (Danish by the way, but write in English so everyone is able to understand. And I change the time to fit Danish standarts...)&nbsp;

      Summer has finall found Denmark. After two agonizing month of grey clouds, at least a down pour a day and between 15-20 degress celcius (59-68 degrees Fahrenheit) every day.  So now that we have entered August we are pounded by heat. The temp rose from 20-27 degrees celcius (68-80.6 degrees Farhreheit) in the matter of only  TWO  days. We never saw it coming and therefore wasn't prepared. So it's like everybody is melting like an Ice-Cream Cone in hot weather. Including me...  I have a fit where I have grapes in the house non stop. I just need to have them. It's better than the M&M fever I had a month ago, because the grapes appeals more to the health side.  I can't stop changing the name of my Blog... I constantly find a more crazier title so it'll be changed a lot during it's lifetime.  I have created two new Blog's. One for my obsession about Names and one for my fave TV couples. There's only one entry in each, but there'll come more later. I promise... Just click my whole bio.

      Something that I have done plenty off. Sleep-wise and how much I sleep in general. I am a case that need to be studiet.  I only need 6-7 hours of sleep scattered over 48 hours. Meaning that I barely need to sleep at all, and I joke that I was bitten by a bat, being a baby and was napping outside on the back porch of the house. Because I have, in my 27 year old life, been a very un-keen sleeper. Need I say that I drove my parents nuts as a kid... Because not only did I not want to go to sleep, no I was up before the birds too in the morning. I just couldn't sleep and I still can't.  I need to rest my body now and then though, so I'll just lay down to read or watch TV for some time, before getting on with what I was doing before that.  So as I proclaimed before: I need to be studiet...
