      This is for all of you out there who are wondering about the Raven I created, Josephine Wong. Well, she is the Natalya's World Raven. Change of name here, her superhero identity is now Kendo Raven, not Raven the Second. Like the original Raven, she has telekinesis and the ability to melt things with her mind. I have added a few extra powers to her: telepathy and a talent with kendo. She is obviously a lot like Raven; like the original Raven, she is the daughter of a demon. In this case, his name is Voltron, a demon who raped her mother Amelia. This resulted in her birth as a cold angry half-demoness who sometimes turn evil and attack those around her, even those she loved. Despite her dark side getting in the way, she is also human inside; kind and generous. Natalya meets Jo through her old friend Leslie and tries to help her. When Voltron returned to this world to take Jo away, Natalya and the gang defeated him. Thus Jo's demonic side was removed and she was cured... well, sort of. She still kept her mental powers and used them for good. When trouble strikes, she dons the trademark dark blue hooded cape and black mask of Raven and her kendo sword and fights alongside Natalya as KENDO RAVEN. Well, that's all gotta go!

       Hey There!   This is my blog....Raven Shrine. I'm going to link this to my Matmice webpage.     Here I will post Season 3 of Natalya's World (In case you don't know wat I am talking about pls refer to my Matmice page  urlLink www.matmice.com/home/mylittlepony2001 ). But that later. Right now.....  Does everybody know the animated cartoon Teen Titans? I have to say...IT ROCKS! Now the Teen Titans are made of Robin, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Raven and Starfire. My Fav Teen Titan is obviously....Raven! She's pretty cool actually, underneath that creepy moody exterior. She's telekinetic, meaning she can move things with her mind. She's the daughter of Trigon, Satan incarnate in the original DC comics, and Arella, a human. So she quite evil, although she does try to be good. Sometimes she can't control her powers. In one episode of Teen Titans, she shows her dark side. More on her later. Right now, back to Natalya's World.  Yep, I will try my best to post it here. Since I like Raven so much, I created a character based on here. Will tell you more later...right now gotta go!
