       I just tried Windows Longhorn beta 4051.  I got it off of  urlLink emule .  It is  *very*  ugly.  Longhorn is much more bloated than Windows XP (and I thought that was bad).  Windows Explorer in Longhorn has a large XP-style menu on the left side and a completely unnecessary menu under the toolbars.  Combined with the  *gigantic*  back and forward buttons that are permanently docked at the  /very/  top of the window, this leaves very little space for the actual file view.  To top it all off, the address bar is actually visible by default (was not in XP) but it looks horrific; yet it does have a semi-cool drop-down list for each directory/subdirectory.  The quicklaunch, system tray, and clock now reside in their own gigantic (~5-icon width wide) toolbar on the right side of the screen.  The clock is overly large.  When you click on the clock a much larger clock will popup.  The taskbar and new  ugly  sidebar take forever to load.  The sidebar can be minimized, but then there is no way to see your quicklaunch, system tray, and clock....  What a shame.

       Torrentz is a website that allows you to download just about anything you could want (legally or illegally) via Bitorrent.  Torrentz changed their homepage for about a week to notify their visitors that they would be down due to legal issues.  It appears now that Torrentz is down for good.

       I currently know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript very well.   I usually end up looking up CSS commands and I have to refer to websites for some lesser-known JavaScript commands.  I also know Perl and some Visual Basic commands.  I can easily alter Perl scripts and I have made some of my own.  I do not know Perl very fluently but I know if well enough.  I only know some Visual Basic code because I have developed a few Visual Basic programs.  The VB project I am most proud of is  urlLink Network Message Send .  I currently know bits and pieces of Unix shell script, DOS, and any other language similar to the ones I already know.  I haven't been able to program and design much recently because I've been busy with school, swimming, water polo, and illness.  I am going to learn Java next year in a class in high school.  I am not too excited about learning Java but it is the only language they teach at my school besides Visual Basic.  I believe Java will not grow online anymore.  It is almost obsolete on the internet and the only place it is really used is cellphones.  I self-taught myself all of the other languages I know so I am not sure how they will teach the course and if it will be easier to learn from an instructor.

        urlLink GeeXBox  is a Linux distro meant to be used to allow any computer to become a home entertainment system.  I found out about GeeXBox when it was in its 0.9 stage.  It was alright back then but it had some bugs and was a bit glitchy.  GeeXBox 0.97 is out now and it is incredible!  GeeXBox has TV-out support, support for common controllers, the ability to find and play any shared media on the network, an internal FTP server to allow anyone on the network to remote the file system, and support for  many  different media formats.  Many settings in GeeXBox can be customized by Windows or Linux users by downloading the ISO generator and changing/replacing files before the ISO is re-created.  I have created two Matrix-style themes for GeeXBox that can be found on  urlLink GeeXdB.net .  I am planning to build a shuttle box this summer that I will hook into our TV and stereo system.  The video card will have to have SVIDEO support and will probably some kind of nVidia.  The sound card will need to be very good.  512MB RAM should be good.  GeeXBox is live-cd based so it loads itself into RAM on boot and I want to be able to cache as much of the movie I am watching as possible.  The CPU does not need to be fancy; just as much as a DVD requires.  The motherboard should have USB 2.0 support (I believe it is standard anyways).  The motherboard does not need built-in audio or video; however a built-in NIC would be nice.

       Blogger's new features and new look is awesome and everyone seems to be loving it.  One thing that Blogger is still missing though is a way for users to customize their RSS feeds more.   (For those of you who don't know what RSS is check out  urlLink What is an RSS Feed?  and  urlLink Introduction to RSS ) .  Users of Blogger can currently edit their website template and the HTML code in their posts but they do not have the ability to alter their RSS feed in any way.  Blogger probably does this so people cannot mess up their RSS feed and render it useless.  A good way for Blogger to allow editing is to allow users to add some extra select tags to their feed to allow some more flexiblity.  The RSS tags are really the only thing that need editing.  The reason I thought of this is because I recently licensed my blog under a  urlLink Creative Commons  license to allow people to re-distribute my work, make derivative works from it, and even sell my work as long as they give me credit for it and license their work under the same Creative Commons license.  This allows the words I am writting here to be heard legally by means of   open-source-like   redistribution.  Anyways, after licensing my work I found that I could put a few tags into my RSS feed and people would know, if they accessed my blog via the feed, that the work was still licensed under the Creative Commons license.  I then realized that there was no way for me to edit the feed without logging into my server and manually editing it.  Blogger doesn't currently allow users to edit their feeds in  any  way  My idea for Blogger is to create a few form fields (HTML input boxes) to allow users to add the correct tags to their document to inform users about the licensing information of their feed.  Each post should have its own licensing tag (which will proabably be the same for all posts).  An example of the licensing tag is:    &lt;cc:License rdf:about="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"&gt;    The whole blog should also have some other tags in it to denote what rights the reader has.  More information about denoting a creative commons license in an RSS 1.0 feed can be found at  urlLink RDF Site Summary 1.0 Modules: mod_cc .

       I discussed the algorithm one would use to convert decimal to binary.  I decided that it would probably be easiest to start of with a simple method simlar to this:   $decnum = &lt;STDIN>; # get input from the user while($decnum    for ($x = 1; $x    # find the largest number that where { log(x)/log(2) = W (W is a whole number) }     $maxnum = $x;   }   $decnum -= $maxnum; # subtract the binary-based num. we have so we can loop   push (@onevals, $maxnum); # store the binary-based num. for later use  } $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # get the largest binary-based num. we put in storage $binarynum = "1"; # add a 1 in front (this is our starting point)  for($x = 1; $x    $binarynum .= "0"; }  while(@onevals) { # add all the ones in the right spots   $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # find the next largest binary-based number   $binarynum ~= /0(0{log($currentnum - 1)})$/; # find where the next one should go   $binarynum = $` . 1 . $1; # add the one in there } print "$decnum in binary is: $binarynum"; # print the result   Please realize that this code was just written off the top of my head and I haven't even tried it yet.  Perl is almost never bug-free for me the first time.  Its the basic idea though.

        if( $fed_trouble )  {  print "It wasn't be";  &crash;  }    urlLink This Slashdot article  poses the idea of opening up your wireless LAN to the world so that you can do what you like and claim it was a neighbor or a  urlLink wardriver .  On our home wireless firewall we have MAC address restriciton and a DHCP setup.  Both of these would have to be turned off to allow outsiders (and you) to access your LAN and anonymously use it.  This would allow people to ruin your bandwidth; plus I doubt the authorities would believe that you didn't know what you were doing.

       To re-program the game Pong you need to consider a few basic variables.  The speed of the ball must be kept constant and the slope of the ball must change accordingly when a ball hits an object.  The actual slope of the line that the ball is traveling in can be determined by the  urlLink Pythagorean theorem :  A 2  + B 2  = C 2  .  A is the change in the X axis per millisecond, B is the change in the Y axis per millisecond, and C is the slope of the line.  When the ball hits a flat surface the slope must change to allow the direction of the ball to change.  When the ball hits a horizontal flat surface the change in Y must become negative and the change in X must stay the same.  When the ball hits a vertical flat surface the change in X must become negative and the change in Y must stay constant.  A more accurate game of Pong would include other variables such as a change in slope according to the velocity of the paddle at the moment that it hit the ball and where the ball hit the paddle (the edge or the center).  These factors would change the velocity of the ball and would make the game more interesting, however they require much more math.   The previous post was posted from my cell phone while I was at school.  I text messaged an email address that can be used to post to my blog.  I thought of the ideas behind the making of Pong today after my friend asked how you would go about programming a game of Pong.

       I'm getting ready for a switch to Linux.  This time it will be fairly permanent (I hope).  I switched to Linux last winter break for about two weeks.  I was using SuSE 9.0 then.  I got into making  urlLink FreeSoftwareReviews  and I needed to use Windows to review software.  I kind of got stuck in it after finding some new software and leaving my Linux distros to obsolete themselves.  I'm debating about which Linux distro to use as my main system.  I have a ridiculous amount of hard drives and I'm hoping to buy two more this summer.  I use a  urlLink Lian Li removable hard drive bay  with 8 removable hard drive drawers.  At the moment my hard drive status is: [Windows 2000/98 (120gb)], [Slackware 9.1 (8gb)], [Mandrake 9.2/Slackware 9.? (80gb)], [Mandrake 10 (8gb)], [SuSE 9.0 (80gb)], [Longhorn (120gb)], [no OS (300mb)], [empty drive drawer], [empty drive drawer].  I think I might try Linspire (aka Lindows), Fedora Core 2 this summer (I tried Fedora Core 1 already).  I think I will be switching to either Mandrake 10, SuSE 9.1, or Slackware 9.1.  I had a little crashing problem in Mandrake 10 (probably because I multi-tasked a  little  too much).  I would love to switch to Slackware permanently but I'm not very familiar with updating my system regularly, patching it myself and such.  If there was a service I could use to do this while in Slackware (or a website that recommends what to update frequently) I may give it a try.  If Fedora Core 2 impresses me more than Core 1 did, I may even switch to it.  Any suggestions are welcome (*hint hint*).

       I changed the name of this blog to chmod 311 because I think it suites the blog and my life in general well.  For those of you who have never had to change file permissions on a Unix-based system,  chmod  is a command that alters read/write/execute permissions of a file according to the user, group, and the rest of the world.  The basic system for changing permissions is based on numbers.   1  represents read permissions,  2  represents write permissions, and  4  represents execute permissions.    The basic file permissions chart:       user  group  everyone     read   1    1    1      write   2   2  3     execute  4  4  4     Most of the files I deal with, including many of the files on my harddrive can be read and written by me and can be seen by the whole world.  In this way I can share many different files and allow others to use them yet keep people from changing those files on my computer.  (This is how it works on most p2p clients)

       I  urlLink switched to Fedora Core 2 (Linux) a while back  and I'm still using it.  It seems like each time I install a new system I get more and more things to work correctly and I learn how to overcome more and more obstacles.  Windows hackers/techies have to perform tasks to overcome obstacles all the time, but they are usually very different obstacles than the ones you find in Linux.  I have ran into many problems so far in Linux and overcome quite a few.  A few of the problems I have run into so far include:     lack of Cannon i950 printer drivers installing a printer attached to another machine (Windows) on the network   uncorrupting amule (emule for Linux)   getting sound to work after breaking it, installing a new Window Manager (IceWM)   finding various dependencies for various programs   making my own shell scripts    I have overcome most of these problems.  I just bought Slackware 10 (it was really free with $6 shipping) and I am hopping to switch sometime soon.  I need to set some goals to accomplish before I feel that I can switch.  I want to be able to compile and install a new kernel, and keep up-to-date on various other software easily.

       I recently noticed that since G4 and TechTV have merged many of Kevin's dark tips have been transferred but an archive for them has not been made.  I started an archive of them yesterday.  I used this opportunity to test out the use of very simple HTML and multiple style sheets.  I used javascript to change the style sheet and save/load the user's last style sheet in their cookies.  I experimented with floating DIVs, creating content before and after commands and many other cool CSS tricks.  The archive is licensed under a very non-restricting Creative Commons license (as expected) and I'll change the archive if you contact me about it.  Oh.... and I also made an RSS feed for it from scratch.   urlLink Unofficial Dark Tips Archive

       I finally switched to Linux.  I installed Fedora Core 2 last friday night and I loaded all of my music, family photos, and other important documents onto Fedora by Sunday.  I am using an 80gb hard drive which is sufficient for now even though I had almost a completely full 120gb one for Windows.  The games and programs for Linux tend to take up less space and I don't need as many of them.  I have a Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia keyboard.  It is a nice keyboard besides the fact that it has an "F Lock" key that has to be pressed "on" before the function keys (F1 - F12) can be used.  I used to use a Windows regsitry hack that fixed this by changing all of the keycodes of the new and useless functions of the F keys (like print, reply, save) to act as if they were the normal F keys.  Now that I am using Linux I had to get used to pressing that dumb "F Lock" key again.  I got sick of it so I made a shell script that fixes the problem.  The script is available and licensed under the  urlLink GPL .  The script is:  urlLink f_lock_fix

       Microsoft officially patented the double-click.  What has this world come to?  An "Anonymous Coward" on Slashdot claims that the double-click was first made by aliens before Microsoft.  I don't know if I would go that far, but I am sure it was used before Microsoft was ever thought of.   Quoting   urlLink Microsoft Receives Patent For Double-Click   Could mere humans have thought up the concept of clicking twice!   The summary of the patent in fluffed-up-fancy-shmancy-english terms is:  Quoting   urlLink United States Patent: 6,727,830   A method and system are provided for extending the functionality of application buttons on a limited resource computing device. Alternative application functions are launched based on the length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal, period of time. An alternative function of the application is launched if the button is pressed for a long, (e.g., at least one second), period of time. Still another function can be launched if the application button is pressed multiple times within a short period of time, e.g., double click.   Ironically, the FTC is  urlLink planing to examine the patent application process  to avoid patent abusers and "patent trolls"

       I found a  urlLink Simple RSS Aggregator  script made by Mark Irons.  It allows you to run a perl script which fetches 1 or more rss formatted pages and displays their output.  The script is very basic and can be easily modified.  I modified the script to include the required libraries within the script itself.  I also added a readme file and made the script a little more professional looking.  Version 1.1 is available here:  urlLink http://www.treyhunner.com/simple-rss-aggregator-1.1.tar.gz

       About two weeks ago I made a Perl script that traps malicious bots (specifically spambots) that visit a website using the script, clutters the spambots email lists with an infinite amount of randomly generated email addresses, and blocks the bot from the web server. I am hosting the scripts on Sourceforge under the name  urlLink SandTrap .  I am hoping that the script will be used on at least a few servers and that some perl/CGI junkies might help touch it up a little eventually.  The website for SandTrap is not functional at the moment but the layout is done.  The full website will eventually be at  urlLink sandtrap.sourceforge.net .

       I am hosting wallpapers from my two vacations last month to San Fransisco and Catalina Island.  I just made the page for the wallpapers yesterday.  One of them is still a broken link and I haven't made any thumbnails for the pictures yet.  I hope to make a nice little page for these wallpapers that shows a thumbnail, picture name, resolution, and picture taker.  Right now the page is hosted on my 1GB Oktagone server but I hope to move it to my friend's 1GB Powweb server once he gives me all of his pictures from the trip also.   urlLink   Wallpapers Page
