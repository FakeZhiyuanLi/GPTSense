      Made lentil soup for dinner tonight.  Damn, that is good.  And so simple.  And so cheap.  About 8 ounces of lentils, water, a diced onion, a few sliced carrots, and a diced green bell pepper.  Plenty of salt & pepper.  One pot warms ya.  I keep pulling up other windows on my computer.  I can hardly pay attention enough to write tonight.  Guess there's nothing too exciting to write.  There's an art project going on in Austin.  Check out the website, (http://www.cracksinthepavement.com), but basically, it is sort of a scavenger hunt for art around the Austin area.  I went yesterday during my lunch break and right after work.  Only thing I managed to find was tall grass with unidentified bugs that bit my feet.  And I got my dress pretty dirty.  Hey, I went right after work.  Thank goodness I always carry a spare pair of flip-flops.  But, then again, who knows....maybe those high heels would have given me an advantage in the tall grass.  Anyhow, I really hope I find some piece of art in all of this.  I am just worried folks are going to beat me to it.  Beat me to them.  Whatever.  Thank goodness it is Thursday.  This week has gone by quickly, but without much sleep.  Here's to the weekend.  Think I'm going to Houston & Lake Charles.  For Father's Day & Paw-Paw's 88th birthday.  That man is in great shape.  I'm so impressed.  I'm sure my dad will live the same way....healthy as a bean up until at least his 118th birthday.  Question #5: If a new medicine were developed that would cure arthritis but cause a fatal reaction in 1 percent of those who took it, would you want it to be released to the public? Answer #5: Sure.  Who's fault is it that they've got arthritis, anyhow?  And should they decide to take medication for it, let them know the risks & allow them to decide.  No big deal.  Folks really need to take more accountability for their own actions, and not depend upon other people to tell them what to do.  So, make it available, and let folks decide if it's something they want to risk or not.  Their decision.

      I had a program scheduled for this afternoon, in which I was supposed to have 40 kiddos (4-11 year olds).  Big, unpleasant surprise.  I got to the site early, so I decided to spend a few minutes sitting in my truck, listening to music.  Only, it wasn't music I heard.  My ears were overwhelmed with the shouts and screams coming from inside the building.  Yes, inside the building.  At this point, I laid my chair back and closed my eyes for about two minutes.  Tried to think of the reasons that I was here.  Why I wanted to be here.  That I was paid to be here.  Even my purest unselfish thoughts were interrupted with the echoes of the fighting, hollering, and caterwauling going on only yards away.  Finally, I shut my eyes hard one last time.  Then opened them, grabbed my stuff and headed inside.  As I mentioned before, I was told there would be almost 40 kids.  As I walked in, I grabbed the nearest recreation staff member.  I asked him if these were all of the kids.  He looked around.  I'm not sure what he said next (as it was too loud to hear even inches away), but I read his lips as, "Uh, yeah.  This is them."  There were more than 40.  In fact, there were 87.  As soon as I walked into the gym (which, by the way, was stuffy & hotter than the balmy 91Â°F it was outside), the staff members walked out and sat down in the hallway.  I guess they had some serious gossiping to do.  Instead of helping me by disciplining the kiddos (ahem, their job), they thought it was coffee break time.  There was, however, one guy that came back every 8 minutes or so to blow a whistle and get the kids quieter.  Not quiet, but quieter.  Anyway, the position I was in (in the middle of a circle of 87 screaming kids), I did not want to walk out just to address the lazy staff, which probably would have just been PO'd that I was asking for much-needed help, and not have done much anyhow.  So, I did the lesson, finished, and ran out of there like a jack rabbit.  The good news is that when I got back to the office (after another lesson, which- actually- went quite well), I got some sweet sympathy from my coworkers, which I really had been looking forward to.  They are so great.  Enough about the bad part of the day.  The good part?  I had Ranch Style Beans for dinner.  Damn, those are so good.  I really need to learn how to make them (as good as the canned kind), with less sodium.  Soooo good.  Question #4:  If you could spend one year in perfect happiness but afterward would remember nothing of the experience would you do so?  If not, why not? Answer #4:  Well, perfect happiness would include a substantial increase in income....be it work-related, inheritance, investments, or anything else.  Anyhow, missing out on something short-term like a simple memory is nothing compared to the possibility of obtaining a large chunk of money to put toward a future long term investment.

      Friday night.  I had the day off of work.  The best feeling I had all day was waking up when my alarm clock went off (forgot to turn it off Thursday night), then switching the button to the 'OFF' position.  I love falling asleep after waking up to an alarm.  Gotta be the best sleep ever.  I think I even drooled a little more than regular, too.  Think I'm about to go watch a movie while I fold clothes.  Either 'Fantasia 2000' or 'Frailty'- not sure what that's about, but I like the name.  But, 'Fantasia 2000' is shorter.  We'll see.  I grilled eggs today.  Meat is so darn expensive.  Not to mention hidden with lots of fat.  So I got some eggs, which I'd like to mention, have gone WAY down in price.  For 2.5 dozen (30 eggs), I used to pay $3.66-- this was last year & this year, up until April.  Then, they went to $2.36.  I thought that was golden.  I went to the store this afternoon, and they were $1.99!  For 30 eggs!  It's like those chickens are giving them away.  That's just crazy.  Anyway, so when I got home, I boiled a dozen.  While waiting for that, I chopped up a couple of 1015 onions, green bell peppers, a few zucchinis, and a Gala apple.  Let that stuff marinate in Italian dressing, worcestershire, liquid smoke, and soy sauce.  Then, skewered it all....yep, including those boiled eggs (peeled, of course) & placed them on the grill.  Man, it turned out great.  And they were easy to eat-- I don't eat the yolks, but the peeling of the whites was simple.  And they even browned a little, made sort of a rubbery cooked meat texture-- that was damn good.  Anyway, a whole lot cheaper and leaner than meat....and maybe even a little more fun.  Boiled grilled eggs, by Kelly.  Question #3: If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?  Why haven't you told them yet? Answer#3: Probably tell my dad that he is the most important person in my life.  Tell him that everything he ever did for us (myself, brother, & sister)-- take us camping, teach us how to fish, how to canoe, how to cook eggs, how to cook beans, the importance of exercise, why reading can be fun by finding the right magazines, how drinking wine can be fun & part of a healthy lifestyle, the importance of appreciating underrated movies, how each person has his/her individual quirks-- I could go on & on, but these things he did for us have made and still influence who we are today, and just why we enjoy life as much as we do.  My favorite memory in my life is riding bikes with my dad.  One summer, especially.  He would come home from work, and we would both get on our road bikes and ride for just over an hour.  I liked watching how skilled he was on his bike, and I liked watching him watch me-- he looked proud.  I guess we both were.

      Dammit.  I have been in love with these shoes for what seems like forever, but, more likely, about six months.  And, they have not gone down in price.  Kate Spade's Beguile Pump (I love the brown....with the cute pink flower, but damn, the black is pretty darn cute, too) http://store.nordstrom.com/product/product_brandboutique.asp?styleid=2820837&boutique=kate_spade&category=2376778~2372811~2380301~2380300&NextStyleID=2824169&PrevStyleID=2819294  I had a program with K-1 kids today.  Good Lord, I cannot believe how untamed those kiddos were.  I left with a hoarse voice and higher blood pressure.  But, I gotta say, when they were quiet, they were cute as buttons.  We have Friday off of work.  I thought I might go to the Texas State History Museum and eat some jelly beans while browsing the exhibits.  We'll see.  Knowing me, I'll stay home & pretend to clean most of the day.  Actually, I think it's going to be a nice day.  May have to grill.  And drink sangria while reading a magazine on the patio.  While watching my plant die.  Poor thing.  Just bought it not even a week ago, and it already looks bad.  I put it on a hook early on in the week.  The past few days, I (of course) did not water it.  Today, when I got home, it looked withered.  Perhaps too much water?  Or maybe it was the surprise of the sun coming out after a few days in hiding.  Who knows.  When I bought it, I just hoped it would last for a month.  Cross your fingers for me.  I should carry a plant-killing pass.  Stores would only be allowed to sell hearty plants to card-carrying members like myself.  And maybe we could even get a discount, since the plant's expectancy would be somewhat short-lived.  I mean, folks like myself really do support the plant nurseries-- we cannot keep our own, so we must keep buying.  Now that I think about it a bit more, we really should get a discount.  One plant to a green thumb is like eight plants to a black thumb like myself.  Oh well.  Long live the easy-care cactus.   From 'The Book of Questions'  Question #2: Do you believe in ghosts or evil spirits?  Would you be willing to spend a night alone in a remote house that is supposedly haunted?  Answer #2: Yes, I believe in ghosts.  And, depending upon the nature of the haunted house, I would consider staying there alone.  Could be interesting.  But I get cold easily, so as long as I had enough blankets (also a feeling of security for me), I think I'd be OK.

      Raining cats and dogs.  I love that saying.  I guess today was one of those days.  One of those raining cats and dogs days.  And, just 'one of those days' days.  A big outdoor event I was supposed to take part in (work related) was cancelled because of the weather.  I found that out after I got there & drove around looking for people who weren't there.  But there were other people there.  Austinites.  They certainly looked the part.  Slightly rumpled Columbia clothes, unshaven faces, and loyal dog at foot.  And they all drove nice cars, too.  Dirty cars, but I suppose it was residue from all the rain.  Anyway, it made me wonder what they do.  Do for work, I mean.  My first thought was that they were writers.  Maybe not all of them.  But a good number.  As I'm writing this, I wonder if any of them are professors.  Off for the summer.  I wonder what they do in the summer, anyhow.  Hmm.  Walk their dogs in the park on a rainy day, I suppose.  "The Book of Questions" has been sitting on my computer desk for a couple months now.  Think I got it back in 1997.  The questions have remained the same (it is a book, afterall), but over the years, some of the answers have changed.  Hmm.  Question #1: For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?  Answer #1: No.  I would never live in another country.  Don't think I would ever 'deeply love' a person who supported living in another country, especially with 'little chance of seeing friends or family again.'  And love is no reason to make such a rash decision, anyhow.

      Wow, how easy it is to forget these sort of things.  It is now July.  Besides August, quite possibly the best month of the year.  August being best, of course, for its great weather, and my birthday....which, by the way, this year, will be my GOLDEN birthday.  26 years old on the 26th.  Only happens once in a lifetime.  But it's not August yet.  It's July.  Also a great month because of the warm weather, sunshine, and the greatest (well....it's kinda a tie with Thanksgiving) holiday ever....July 4th.  Everyone America over celebrates what it means to live in our great country....we get together with friends, family, neighbors, church members....we wear red, white, & blue....charcoal or propane, we grill all weekend long....we cry when we sing The Star Spangled Banner....we listen to real American music like Willie, Steve Miller Band, & Jimmy Buffet....and we praise God for blessing us with a life in the greatest place on earth.  Gotta love the Fourth.  We're all headed to my brother, Billy's, house for Saturday.  He's got one of those big smoker/pit type things that he claims can fit an entire cow on.  Who knows.  I'm just looking forward to some of his great brisket.  Think he's starting at 3:00am, and planning to serve at 2:00pm.  Should be fun.  Question #6: You discover your wonderful one-year-old child is, because of a mixup at the hospital, not yours.  Would you want to exchange the child to try to correct the mistake? Answer #6: Dear Lord, yes!  Of course I would want to exchange.  Geez, once I found out it was not really mine, I would not want a child who had some medical history I was unaware of.  What if he/she had a big, fat mom who ate nothing but Twinkies and fried chicken while pregnant?  That's just asking for a fat & retarded kid....but you may not know that nor see the consequences till the poor kid is a couple years old.  No freakin' way I would want to raise a kid that who knows how his/her mom acted while pregnant.  Every damn thing makes a difference.  Did she inhale toxic chemicals just because she wanted to get her toenails painted?  Did she eat/drink refined sugar?  Did she get enough sleep?  Did she inhale smoke from a candle she thought was cute, or perhaps because she just didn't have the nerve to ask for a better seat at a restaurant?  Was she happy when she was pregnant?  Does she have a good relationship with her husband?  Did she want this child?  And the list goes on.  There are just too many ways a person can screw up that I would not trust a soul to make a baby good enough for me.  Give me my own.
