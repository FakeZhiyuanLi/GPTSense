      Hey all i am going to the slipknot concert wednesday with monica it will be fun  but get this i called chase to tell her and then they call me back and was like, do you know what goes on at slipknot concerts and started telling me all this stuff that happend at the concert when a girl from her school went like its going to repeat itsself and happen at this concert too  because josh has been to a concert before and KNOWS what goes on(not) and they just called me back just to ruin my excitement and make me mad, which i dont know why he would care if i went, i mean its not like he cares about me enough to say all this stuff he just did it to make me mad like a butt he is, i could care less im going to have a good time and prove to them that all concerts arent all like that then i will rub it in their face on what i a good time i had  GOODBYE &nbsp;
