      I know that I have been reviewing allot of movies lately but today I wont be doing any movie reviews. Although movie related it is not a movie review.  When thinking of the horror movies I have watched lately. I said to myself why would I want to watch a movie that would chill you to the bone and make you utterly afraid. Then the subject of horror movies strangely arose during diner. After sitting through a meal where everyone shared the horror movies they had seen it made me think even more.  The reason I would often watch a horror movie is to see what the outcome is like. How these characters will triumph over thier greatest fears. Everyone loves to see a hero but a hero in a horror movie is a different hero. Not a superhero, action hero, or some amazing guy off of the pages of some manga. But they are usually cast as a normal human with problems and difficulties and failures. Like all of us.  So now matter what we are dealing with we can get a little glimmer of hope that maybe one day things will be better. That one day the monsters in are lives will be over come. No matter how big or little the trials in your lives maybe one day they will end.  Psalm 23  Philippians 4:13  Lates,  Smog

      Today I saw I Robot, this movie surprised the heckl out of me. I was utterly amazing. The story was great as well as the plot twists. The cg of the robots was fantastic all the animations were sooo realistic. The whole story played out so well that you couldn't tell who the villian in the story was until the end. I was told this was a good movie by one of my friend I saw bourne with the other day and he was right.  For those who don't know I Robot is a story about one man who doesnt trust robots even though everyone says he is crazy. The robots follow three laws:      A robot cannot hurt a human being     Robots must do what they are commanded to do unless this violates the first law     A robot must protect itself from harm unless it violates the first or second law    Civilization believes that these laws will protect them but obviously they are wrong. If i say anymore i will ruin the movie.  Anyways I would rank this movie a 9/10.  Lates,  Smog  Thanks to Drew for telling advising me to go to the movie and Yuiichi for helping me with some computer stuff.

       I watched the bourne supremacy again yesterday with my buddies the first time i guess i was just caught up in the motions of the movie because at the end of the day it was not as great as i previously believed the plot was rather strange. There was very little speech from our main character and bourne would often run around place to place not knowing who was chasing him and why. So he constantly asked the same repetative questions over and over making you want to shout out at him.      The sequal to me was not as great as the origonal but it was a good espionage movie and rather entertaining action movie. The plot could have been edited from the book it was taken from to make it bit more interesting but all in all it wasn't bad I would rate it 7.5/10     lates,     Smog

      I feel as if is that time again, all students know what I'm talking about that feeling like school is around the corner. How every student hate the fact they are going to go back but also embrace it because they get to hang out with thier friend again. Well thats where I'm at. I don't want to head back to school but the lazing around is starting to get to me, I do the same things every day. I sleep in then wake up to cook breakfast for my brother and sister. Sometimes I hep my Dad with work others I watch tv and then I sometimes swim in the pool. When my parents get home we have diner and then we usually go for a swim around 9 O'clock. Then I stay up until 12:30+. So where is this all going and what am I getting to..... well I don't know. Maybe it was the fact that I was glad my routine is going to be broken tommorrow as one of my best friends is coming over tommorrow maybe I just had nothing to write about. So here is a message to you Yuiichi bring mgs:tts, your laptop, Unreal 2k4, and .... I dont know anything else you want. You probably already pissed that I keep reminding you but I'm just used to King Mericon forgetting everything.  Lates,  Smog

      It surprised me to hear this but Canada actually won a medal in this years summer olympics. Just yesterday our womans team won a bronze for syncronized diving. So I gues I have to write this because I was harping on the Canadians in one of my former blogs. BUt still its only one medal and Canada should still have more. We have mor money better facilities better well.... everything. It is still an imbarassment for Canadian athletes to lose so badly in the Oylmpics.  Oh yeah and on anothern note the olympics should be for amateur athletes under 25. I mean really Canada sent a woman for the shooting competion that was 53 years old. Come on (Come on what..... hehe sorry back to typing) no wonder we suck we are sending old bags to the olympics. The Canadians must be a laughing stock at the Olympics.  lates,  Smog

      I often read Yuiichi's blog and he often speaks about all of the anime that he watches. Anyways  I was sitting at home doing nothing and I came across the FMP that I had burned off of some poor schmuk. Well I put it in my laptop and started watching it. After I was done watchin a few episodes I thought back to how I always used to watch anime. Just a few years ago I wouldnt watch anything unless it was anime no matter how gay the story might have been or if it was even for kids it didnt matter to me.  So eventually I just stopped watching anime but when i put on FMP i was really suprised how much I enjoyed it. So this is where your part come Yuiichi, could you just give me some advice on some good animes to download since you are all ways downloading.  Lates,  Smog

      In former blogs I have talked about seeing the Village. Seeing how I promised to go with my Aunt I had to wait until she got back from California to see it. After she returned which was about a week ago she got really sick and we couldnt see it until today. So I have finally seen it and .... well it was really wierd. Usually I dont like giving the story away but I'm going to anyways. So if you dont want to know the whole story dont read past the **** further down the blog.  The Village is about .... well a village based in 1870-80's Pennsilvania. This small village that is located inside of a valley is surrounded by a forest. For those who do not already know this forest is the home for a group of terrible monsters. The Elders of this village moved into this place to escape the outside towns where they say horrible things happen. All of the Elders tell stories of how many people are killed in the outer towns and that the people who live there are savages that ave no moral value. When the Elders moved to the valley to escape the outside world they made a treaty with the monsters that lived in the forest. They promised the monsters that the villagers would not go into the woods as long as the monsters did not enter the village. The villagers were also not allowed to wear or have the colour red in thier village. Because this was a forbidden colour and the monsters or those we can not name will attack if they see this colour. So anyway in the begining of the movie a little child dies and one of the villagers ask to leave the village in order to get medicine so no one else will die like the little boy. He is denied twice so one day he decides to walk several feat in and one of the monsters see him so he quickly goes back to the village. That night the mosters enter the village and leave signs on all of the doors warnig the people not to enter the woods.  After this part you might not want to read if you have not already seen the movie and want to see it.   ****  So another night they are holding a wedding and the mosters return to the village again but this time they kill the villagers live stock and then they skin them and leave them at different places in side of the village. All of the villagers are scared except for one namedLucius Hunt who falls in love with this blind girl named Ivy Walker. So they anounce their engagement which seriously angers another villager named Noah Percy (who i believe has terets syndrome because he always shakes). So in anger Noah stabbs Lucius and the rest of the villagers find out. So they punish Noah by locking him in an empty room. So Ivy ass the her father who is the head elder if she can go to one of the outer town to get medicine. He allows her to leave but first he has to show her something. What you are about to read will seriously ruin the movie for everyone so this is your last chance to stop reading.    They go to this cabin which is off limits to the villagers and inside are what the audience believes at this point will be one of the monster and they are right. But not exactlyit is only a costume of a monster. Right know if you havnt seen it you are scratching your head saying what the heck. You see the Elders who had lived in the outside world wanted to leave so badly that they made up this story about monsters so that the villagers would not leave the village and venture into the world beyond the forest.  Ivy's dad talks to the elders and at first they are reluctant to allow her to go but eventually let Ivy leave. So Ivy leaves withe two escorts but one chickens out at the edge of the forest and the other leave several minutes in. In the woods she is attacked by one of the monsters.... right now your thinking wait a minute I thought the mosters were elders and the elders allowed her to leave. Well your right this monster is the retarded Noah who found a costume under the floor boards in the empty room and then he escaped. So Noah fools around and chases her she eventually tricks him to fall into a pit and Noah dies. Remember Ivy is blind so eventually she reaches this road she has to get to and then she reaches the wall she must climb. As soon as she gets over she is met by a man in a jeep. Yes I said a jeep, and the man is nice unlike what the elders have said. This is because the elders were all part of a support group for people who's family members had been killed by acts of violence. So the delusional elders fled. Anyways this man in the jeep turns out to be a park ranger in charge of a wildlife reservation but Ivy cant tell because she is blind. The year is closer to 2004 then 1870 and the village is inside of an animal reservation that is why the elders dont want the outsiders to know of thier town. So Ivy eventually get some medicine and brings it to Luscious. THE END!  So here is a wrap up the elders all had one .... well maybe two things in common they had all lived through deaths in thier families caused by extreme violence and they were really crazy. So in their delusions they escaped to an animal reservation to live. Then they told thier children the outside world was evil and that thier were monsters in the forest. So if that isnt clear enough I can explain more just email me at  templar_40k@hotmail.com      Anyways I thought this movie had the biggest twist in it from any movie I had ever seen and that.... well it was interesting so I give it an 8.5/10. It is enjoyable, just crazy and it really makes you review the story over and over again.  Oh yah and  urlLink Adrien Brody  does a really good job as  Noah.  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix  the evil emporer from Gladiator does a good job as Lucious (which is actually his nephews name in gladiator) and  urlLink Bryce Dallas Howard  who is Ron Howards (Ron Howard is a famous director for those who do not know) daughter does a really good job in her firstrole as the blind Ivy.  The End  Lates,  Smog

      If anyone is keeping track of the olympics (which who in Canada actually cares about the summer Olympics) you would know that well it has only been one day but the Canadaians are stinking up the joint. The Canadian athletes look like bums not even able to pass qualifying rounds. Anyways if they dont start doing better they might aswell pull the whole team out of greece. Actually they should just stick to winter Olympics. Hopefully they will start doing better, on that note I bet that Canadians are more excited about the World Cup of Hockey then the Summer Olympics. Hockey rules. Go Canada Go!  lates,  Smog

       I keep trying to play doom 3 but I cant get into it long enough to play though the first level it just doesn’t captivate me. Unlike KotOr, which was, allot more appealing to me.  But anyway, today I had to go over to my cousin’s house for her birthday. I was a really girly party with make up and stuff, but it wasn’t until today that I realized how "street" she is becoming. She has allot of friends that dress like (well I'll just say they are uncivilized for this purpose). They had thier R&amp;B, rap, monkey music blasting in the backyard that drowned out the movie that I was watching. And I had surround sound and subwoofer! Neways it was wierd beause they inturrupted my movie *expierence* by running down stairs and chanting to watch little BowWow. By this point I couldnt take any more street culture for the day so I turned to my father. Not even by making one gesture he knew what i was thinking. He said to me lets get out of here now. At this moment we bolted for the door and rushed are family home. The whole ride home we were complaining about how much my cousin could really use some good ol' rock music. Anyways since her actual birthday isnt for about a month I think Ill buy her some rock music for her birthday. Hopefully she wont listen to that monkey music anymore.  lates,  Smog

      I know it has been a while since i last posted anything on my blog but since the last time I have posted I have beaten KotOR.  That was one of the best games i have ever played it allowed the player to do almost anything they wanted.  You could be purely evil or a real goody-goody. The real fun of the game is taking the evil path and eventually becoming the Lord of the Sith. Any ways I am waiting for KotOR II which will be released this winter.  Now I just need to get into Doom 3 I havent played very much because i have been into KotOr. But now that I have beaten it I will try to beat Doom 3. Well the more I type the more game time I lose so see ya.  Lates,  Smog

      My last blog was about Doom and even though  it is a really good game the reason i bought it is because I got KotOR for free. For those who do not know it is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. This game is the best Star Wars game I have ever played.  There are amazing aspects to this game that i have always wanted in a Star Wars game.  You start out as  some guard on a ship that is being attacked.  You later fall to this planet and begin to find a jedi named Bastilla.  So while you are on the planet u can talk to people and either be rude or be polite. Doing wut is wrong will give u darkside points and doing wut is right will give u light side points.  Obviously i have chosen to go to the darkside. The only problem with that is your characters face gest all messed up oh well anything for the side of evil.  I advise this game to all  Star Wars fans and rpg fans alike this is a great game.  lates,  Smog

      This week I bought Doom 3. This is the most anticipated game of the year. Although i only bought it to get my hands on last years game of the year Star wars: the knights of the old rebublic. Neways back to doom 3. This game is really freaky, the opening has u walking thru this base on mars with practically no light ( You would guess that by the time we could get to mars there would be some forms of lighting). But anyways as u are walking down this long set of rooms and partof the outside of mars u finally get to this room with a crazy scientist.  This guy babbles on about how he has seeen the devil and how he created a cage for him.  Then all of a sudden there is a warning and stuff just starts blowing up. Then all of a sudden these things start flying around the room and pass thru this scientist. Then remarkably he becomes a zombie and starts attacking u. its really freaky because at first u dont know wut the heck is happening to you.  As u progress back down the halls it gets freakier because u cand hold ur gun and light at the same time.  So when u put ur light on to see the zombies u can see them but as soon as u take out ur gun ur only light (your flashlight goes back into the big old inventory sack). Now u are shooting at a enemy u can barely see. This is really freaky. Luckly no one is black so u can see thier white heads.  So if ur looking for a really good horror game buy Doom 3  late,  Smog

      Lately I havn't posted anything on my blog, this is for all that cared or even noticed (this means the all one of you).  Anyways this week i have beenso busy that i just had no time to post. I have been at a hockey school all week long. For those who are thinking why are you in a HOCKEY SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER !  Well I'm dont know why us canadians do such crazy things but we do. Plus the hockey season starts in two weeks with the start of training camp. Back on the crazy Canadian thing well Canadians are just friggin crazy when it come to hier kids and our national sport of hockey.  The hockey camp was in Toronto and i was in Oakville. (for those who dont live in this area some days it took an hour and forty minutes to get to the rink.  Then during the week I had to help my dad with some technical issues at work the key one being a presentaion to Universal Studios. I had to make the presentation that one of the employees really goofed up on.  Anyways if you wanted to know why i havent posted this is why  Lates,  Smog
