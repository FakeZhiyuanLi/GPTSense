      at the moment Greg Muphy (KRT #51)&nbsp; is winning which is very surprising because he qualified 33rd the two heroes of the v8 supercars (1 from holden, 1 from ford) are now sitting stranded on the infield after accidents They are Mark Skaife( Holden Racing Team, #2) and Marcos Ambrose (Stone Brothers Racing, #1) (also the reigning v8 title holder) its disappointing coz skaife was doing awesome but i hate ambrose anyways so im glad hes out lol hmm i hope holden wins holden chick always check out this website to know more about v8 supercars  urlLink www.v8supercars.com

      man sprintcar off season sucks... but ive been keeping up to date with the aussies overseas kerry madsen and brooke tatnell seem to be doing particulary well! skips doing well also (thats if we can classify him as an aussie nowadays, havent seen him here in a while)  World Series Sprintcars is going to be bigger and better than ever next season and i cant wait! Max and Brooke will renew their rivalry (lol considering max has won 5 WSS crowns, and Brooke has 4, brooke wants to go back to a tie!) Max won last season everyone interested in sprintcars check out these two websites  urlLink www.worldseriessprintcars.com  and  urlLink www.australianspeedway.com  australianspeedway is a speedway forum if u dont get it send a private message to sprintcarzrock (thats me) :)  oh well, time to sign off i might go work on linesys sprintcar  - i crew for a local driver so im always working on his car..
