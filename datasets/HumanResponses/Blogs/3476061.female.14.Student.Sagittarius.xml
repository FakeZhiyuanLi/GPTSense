      This morning sucked. The phone woke me up at friggin 8:30. My latest "getting out of boredom" technique is glue. It may sound all too simple but pouring glue in random objects, waiting for it to dry, then peeling it off is quite fascinating. The other day i made a condom out of glue. It was pretty interesting.   I got this new shaving creme that i desperatly needed b/c ive been using conditioner and my bros shavin stuff for a week. It smells really good so i was tempted to try a lil bit. Needless to say, i fell into the temptation and it was grody. Not everything that smells good tastes good...remember that.   I believe that most of our girl "issues" have been resolved. Theres only one person who i need to talk to...peanut. I think that we've just been spending so much time together that everyone is PMSing at the exact same time. When you have too much estrogen together the outcome is always negative. (arent u proud of me using all these big words)  alright well im off to do w/e it is im supposed to be doing. i might end up at the movies tonight or the pool. later days

      today was a blast. i went out in bajerkys boat with colin, bajerky, carissa, kelly, and drew. I attempted to wakeboard but that didnt go as planned. i fell on my face. enuff of that  all of my "friends" are extremely pissed at me right now. its kind of frustrating b/c it has been like this the entire week. in the past 2 days i have been called a slutt, flirt, and bitch by meghan. kristin implied that i was the second one. i think ppl just need to realize that i have guy friends...sometimes (such as right now) guy friends are 10 times better than girl friends.   i just wanted our last couple of days together to be nice and friendly. well we already screwed that. hope yall have a nice life.    ok im done venting now

      GOOD MORNING WORLD! heehee well last night i went to the pool w/ matt & peanut. It was good to see matt again, feels like its been forever. then i went to the movies with peanut. we saw mean girls. i believe that if i lived there i would fit right in with the plastics which kind of makes me mad and thrilled at the same time. lol   i went to bed early with a migrane then woke up with a headache. this morning i took a nice refreshing shower while BLARING my yellowcard cd.   im peeling on my shoulders and it is extremely GRODY! oh yes and my ear is peeling too. (had to add that one in there for peanut) im not going to ballet this morning b/c i was sposed to get a ride but failed to do so. (boy dont i feel all rebelious) the truth of the matter is that im not a rebel. sometimes i wish i could be but rebelion just isnt in my nature. come on if u grew up with a family that expected nothing less than behaving ur best all the time ud be feeling the same thing. thats probably why so many of us church girls (ahem me and peanut) are feeling so rebelious these days.   well this is kind of a longer blog entry for me so i believe im going to go pack for wilmington...oh yeah i forgot to talk about wilmington. its memorial day weekend for those of you who are already caught in the summer days of not remembering wut day of the week it is. im stuck in wilmington with the family and katie. ughies. at least we'll get to go out in the boat where i will continue to get burnt.   alright well im seriously going to go now but before i will sing to you...  jk i wont put you through that horrific experience

      hey this particular blog entry is dedicated to my gurls and some useless advice i have for them.  meghan~you are such an increadible young lady. its amazing how we went from not getting along to being such great friends. i know we will be seeing great things from you in the future. just remember to be carefull how you say things. dont bottle emotions up inside of you untill u cant hold them in any longer. u need to be able to express yourself in your own unique way. i look foward to strengthening our friendship and going through h/s together.  jacy~jaclyn marie you are one of the best friends i ever had. you're such a great listener and advice giver and such a pretty girl. please remember this: even if your family isnt always there for you, you will ALWAYS have your girls. dont look for the approval of others b/c they arent always right. listen eagerly to what they have to offer but dont take things too personaly. also, every once and a while you should be able to complain on your own just dont become whiney. one day, when the time is right you are going to meet an amazing guy whose going to love you. you should be looking for him now, just dont let guys run your life. never stop dancing  chi~i love how you know exactly how to make everybody smile just about all the time.your poetry is deep and i personally think you can get extremely far just by writing. you have a talent...use it as much as you can and as a way to express your feelings. learn to show others how you feel without hurting feelings and avoid getting urs hurt in return. you and i both have the tendancy to want to be the center of attention: take your time in the spotlight and then step to the side and let others take their turn. im going to miss your big smile next year  heather~you are so awesome and always eager to please everyone who crosses your path. try new things for your own sake but dont do ANYTHING just to please others. every once and a while take time to do something just for you b/c u deserve it. work hard to meet new friends b/c the friends you make in h/s will be there forever. learn to let your rebelious side show every once and a while just dont let it take over. you also dont need to worry about guys so much. guys are dirt...there not even worth worrying about.  if a guy doesnt like you for who u are he aint worth ur time. lol   kristin~ i love you so friggin much. i know we havent been that close this year b/c of being on different teams and all. you are such a gorgeous young lady and dont let anybody tell you any different. remember to not bottle up things that you are feeling either. if you have a problem you need to let it out right then and not let things build up for so long. eventually, you will get tired of it.  be yourself, dont let others dictate who you are or your potential. you are another one of the girls who like to be the center of attention. read the advice i gave chi on that one. be careful about leaving people out.           *to all of you, be yourself through h/s and dont let anybody ever dictate who you are. make it a point to stand out by doing what you know is right. you are all beautiful and talented young ladies and dont let anybody tell you any differently.im going to miss you all and our time together. i love yall with all my heart! keep in touch and NEVER forget me b/c i know that i wont forget you*

      havent written in here in a long time. ok well this summer pretty much sucks monkey balls. ive done absolutly nothing. everybody is gone this week so i have nobody to complain to...so im using this. peanuts in the caymens (boy am i jealous) jacy is at the beach and kristin is with jacy at the beach, chi is in vietnam. those are the only ppl i really feel ok whinning to.  tuesday i went over to the kosems to hang out with adam, jonathan, and sb. it was fun. we played paintball and i got shot 2 times. then went to adams hockey game which they won! i almost broke my nose on SB's bed. that kinda hurt. then i woke up yesterday and there wasnt ne one in the house which was kinda scary. then everybody abandoned me in the house so i watched a movie. me adam and jonathan went to the lake/creeky thing to fly fish. and um...jonathan stepped on a really big snake and almost gave me a heart attack. then adam caught a lil snake which he threw and almost hit me in the head. thats about it. sb spent with me. im surprised were not completely sick of each other yet. oh well. ive decided i like living at the kosem house so yeah.   now time to complain: well i THOUGHT i was really starting to like this guy. (i wont use names to protect everybody) lol. so yeah and my friend was telling me how he liked me too. so i told him that i liked him then it turned out that he was just desperate and didnt really like me in the first place which kinda sucks...especially for someone who usually doesnt express her feelings for the dude she likes. i woke up this morning and my stomach was killing me. so im not doing anything today. ok im done now. that was a really really long thinggy   oh yeah and whoevers getting on my SN and adding a bunch of random ppl from dillard drive to my buddy list can u PLEASE stop it. thanks                alright peace.
